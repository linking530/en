<P>The first event of any importance in the family was

<P>the death of Mr. Norris, which happened when Fanny was

<P>about fifteen, and necessarily introduced alterations

<P>and novelties.&nbsp; Mrs. Norris, on quitting the Parsonage,

<P>removed first to the Park, and afterwards to a small house

<P>of Sir Thomas's in the village, and consoled herself

<P>for the loss of her husband by considering that she

<P>could do very well without him; and for her reduction

<P>of income by the evident necessity of stricter economy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The living was hereafter for Edmund; and, had his uncle

<P>died a few years sooner, it would have been duly given

<P>to some friend to hold till he were old enough for orders.

<P>But Tom's extravagance had, previous to that event,

<P>been so great as to render a different disposal of the

<P>next presentation necessary, and the younger brother

<P>must help to pay for the pleasures of the elder.

<P>There was another family living actually held for Edmund;

<P>but though this circumstance had made the arrangement

<P>somewhat easier to Sir Thomas's conscience, he could not

<P>but feel it to be an act of injustice, and he earnestly

<P>tried to impress his eldest son with the same conviction,

<P>in the hope of its producing a better effect than anything he

<P>had yet been able to say or do.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I blush for you, Tom," said he, in his most dignified manner;

<P>"I blush for the expedient which I am driven on, and I trust

<P>I may pity your feelings as a brother on the occasion.

<P>You have robbed Edmund for ten, twenty, thirty years,

<P>perhaps for life, of more than half the income which ought

<P>to be his.&nbsp; It may hereafter be in my power, or in yours

<P>(I hope it will), to procure him better preferment;

<P>but it must not be forgotten that no benefit of that

<P>sort would have been beyond his natural claims on us,

<P>and that nothing can, in fact, be an equivalent for the

<P>certain advantage which he is now obliged to forego

<P>through the urgency of your debts."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Tom listened with some shame and some sorrow;

<P>but escaping as quickly as possible, could soon with

<P>cheerful selfishness reflect, firstly, that he had

<P>not been half so much in debt as some of his friends;

<P>secondly, that his father had made a most tiresome piece

<P>of work of it; and, thirdly, that the future incumbent,

<P>whoever he might be, would, in all probability, die very soon.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>On Mr. Norris's death the presentation became the right of

<P>a Dr. Grant, who came consequently to reside at Mansfield;

<P>and on proving to be a hearty man of forty-five, seemed

<P>likely to disappoint Mr. Bertram's calculations.

<P>But "no, he was a short-necked, apoplectic sort of fellow,

<P>and, plied well with good things, would soon pop off."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He had a wife about fifteen years his junior, but no children;

<P>and they entered the neighbourhood with the usual fair

<P>report of being very respectable, agreeable people.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The time was now come when Sir Thomas expected his

<P>sister-in-law to claim her share in their niece,

<P>the change in Mrs. Norris's situation, and the improvement

<P>in Fanny's age, seeming not merely to do away any former

<P>objection to their living together, but even to give it

<P>the most decided eligibility; and as his own circumstances

<P>were rendered less fair than heretofore, by some recent

<P>losses on his West India estate, in addition to his eldest

<P>son's extravagance, it became not undesirable to himself to be

<P>relieved from the expense of her support, and the obligation

<P>of her future provision.&nbsp; In the fullness of his belief

<P>that such a thing must be, he mentioned its probability

<P>to his wife; and the first time of the subject's occurring

<P>to her again happening to be when Fanny was present,

<P>she calmly observed to her, "So, Fanny, you are going

<P>to leave us, and live with my sister.&nbsp; How shall you like it?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny was too much surprised to do more than repeat

<P>her aunt's words, "Going to leave you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, my dear; why should you be astonished?

<P>You have been five years with us, and my sister

<P>always meant to take you when Mr. Norris died.

<P>But you must come up and tack on my patterns all the same."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The news was as disagreeable to Fanny as it had been unexpected.

<P>She had never received kindness from her aunt Norris,

<P>and could not love her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I shall be very sorry to go away," said she, with a

<P>faltering voice.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, I dare say you will; _that's_ natural enough.

<P>I suppose you have had as little to vex you since you came

<P>into this house as any creature in the world."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I hope I am not ungrateful, aunt," said Fanny modestly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, my dear; I hope not.&nbsp; I have always found you

<P>a very good girl."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And am I never to live here again?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Never, my dear; but you are sure of a comfortable home.

<P>It can make very little difference to you, whether you are

<P>in one house or the other."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny left the room with a very sorrowful heart; she could

<P>not feel the difference to be so small, she could not think

<P>of living with her aunt with anything like satisfaction.

<P>As soon as she met with Edmund she told him her distress.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Cousin," said she, "something is going to happen which I

<P>do not like at all; and though you have often persuaded me

<P>into being reconciled to things that I disliked at first,

<P>you will not be able to do it now.&nbsp; I am going to live

<P>entirely with my aunt Norris."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Indeed!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes; my aunt Bertram has just told me so.&nbsp; It is quite settled.

<P>I am to leave Mansfield Park, and go to the White House,

<P>I suppose, as soon as she is removed there."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, Fanny, and if the plan were not unpleasant to you,

<P>I should call it an excellent one."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, cousin!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It has everything else in its favour.&nbsp; My aunt is

<P>acting like a sensible woman in wishing for you.&nbsp; She is

<P>choosing a friend and companion exactly where she ought,

<P>and I am glad her love of money does not interfere.

<P>You will be what you ought to be to her.&nbsp; I hope it does

<P>not distress you very much, Fanny?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Indeed it does:&nbsp; I cannot like it.&nbsp; I love this house

<P>and everything in it:&nbsp; I shall love nothing there.

<P>You know how uncomfortable I feel with her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I can say nothing for her manner to you as a child;

<P>but it was the same with us all, or nearly so.&nbsp; She never

<P>knew how to be pleasant to children.&nbsp; But you are now

<P>of an age to be treated better; I think she is behaving

<P>better already; and when you are her only companion,

<P>you _must_ be important to her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I can never be important to any one."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What is to prevent you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Everything.&nbsp; My situation, my foolishness and awkwardness."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"As to your foolishness and awkwardness, my dear Fanny,

<P>believe me, you never have a shadow of either, but in using

<P>the words so improperly.&nbsp; There is no reason in the world

<P>why you should not be important where you are known.

<P>You have good sense, and a sweet temper, and I am sure you

<P>have a grateful heart, that could never receive kindness

<P>without wishing to return it.&nbsp; I do not know any better

<P>qualifications for a friend and companion."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are too kind," said Fanny, colouring at such praise;

<P>"how shall I ever thank you as I ought, for thinking

<P>so well of me.&nbsp; Oh! cousin, if I am to go away, I shall

<P>remember your goodness to the last moment of my life."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why, indeed, Fanny, I should hope to be remembered at

<P>such a distance as the White House.&nbsp; You speak as if you

<P>were going two hundred miles off instead of only across

<P>the park; but you will belong to us almost as much as ever.

<P>The two families will be meeting every day in the year.

<P>The only difference will be that, living with your aunt,

<P>you will necessarily be brought forward as you ought to be.

<P>Here there are too many whom you can hide behind; but with

<P>her you will be forced to speak for yourself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh!&nbsp; I do not say so."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I must say it, and say it with pleasure.&nbsp; Mrs. Norris

<P>is much better fitted than my mother for having the charge

<P>of you now.&nbsp; She is of a temper to do a great deal

<P>for anybody she really interests herself about, and she

<P>will force you to do justice to your natural powers."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny sighed, and said, "I cannot see things as you do;

<P>but I ought to believe you to be right rather than myself,

<P>and I am very much obliged to you for trying to reconcile

<P>me to what must be.&nbsp; If I could suppose my aunt really

<P>to care for me, it would be delightful to feel myself

<P>of consequence to anybody.&nbsp; _ Here_, I know, I am of none,

<P>and yet I love the place so well."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The place, Fanny, is what you will not quit, though you

<P>quit the house.&nbsp; You will have as free a command of the

<P>park and gardens as ever.&nbsp; Even _your_ constant little

<P>heart need not take fright at such a nominal change.

<P>You will have the same walks to frequent, the same library

<P>to choose from, the same people to look at, the same horse

<P>to ride."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very true.&nbsp; Yes, dear old grey pony!&nbsp; Ah! cousin, when I

<P>remember how much I used to dread riding, what terrors

<P>it gave me to hear it talked of as likely to do me good

<P>(oh! how I have trembled at my uncle's opening his lips

<P>if horses were talked of), and then think of the kind

<P>pains you took to reason and persuade me out of my fears,

<P>and convince me that I should like it after a little while,

<P>and feel how right you proved to be, I am inclined to hope

<P>you may always prophesy as well."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And I am quite convinced that your being with Mrs. Norris

<P>will be as good for your mind as riding has been for

<P>your health, and as much for your ultimate happiness too."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So ended their discourse, which, for any very appropriate

<P>service it could render Fanny, might as well have been spared,

<P>for Mrs. Norris had not the smallest intention of taking her.

<P>It had never occurred to her, on the present occasion,

<P>but as a thing to be carefully avoided.&nbsp; To prevent its

<P>being expected, she had fixed on the smallest habitation

<P>which could rank as genteel among the buildings of Mansfield

<P>parish, the White House being only just large enough to

<P>receive herself and her servants, and allow a spare room

<P>for a friend, of which she made a very particular point.

<P>The spare rooms at the Parsonage had never been wanted,

<P>but the absolute necessity of a spare room for a friend

<P>was now never forgotten.&nbsp; Not all her precautions, however,

<P>could save her from being suspected of something better;

<P>or, perhaps, her very display of the importance of a

<P>spare room might have misled Sir Thomas to suppose it

<P>really intended for Fanny.&nbsp; Lady Bertram soon brought

<P>the matter to a certainty by carelessly observing to Mrs. Norris--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I think, sister, we need not keep Miss Lee any longer,

<P>when Fanny goes to live with you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Norris almost started.&nbsp; "Live with me, dear Lady

<P>Bertram! what do you mean?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Is she not to live with you?&nbsp; I thought you had settled

<P>it with Sir Thomas."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Me! never.&nbsp; I never spoke a syllable about it to Sir Thomas,

<P>nor he to me.&nbsp; Fanny live with me! the last thing in the

<P>world for me to think of, or for anybody to wish that really

<P>knows us both.&nbsp; Good heaven! what could I do with Fanny?

<P>Me! a poor, helpless, forlorn widow, unfit for anything,

<P>my spirits quite broke down; what could I do with a girl

<P>at her time of life?&nbsp; A girl of fifteen! the very age

<P>of all others to need most attention and care, and put

<P>the cheerfullest spirits to the test!&nbsp; Sure Sir Thomas

<P>could not seriously expect such a thing!&nbsp; Sir Thomas is too

<P>much my friend.&nbsp; Nobody that wishes me well, I am sure,

<P>would propose it.&nbsp; How came Sir Thomas to speak to you

<P>about it?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Indeed, I do not know.&nbsp; I suppose he thought it best."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But what did he say?&nbsp; He could not say he _wished_ me

<P>to take Fanny.&nbsp; I am sure in his heart he could not wish

<P>me to do it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No; he only said he thought it very likely; and I thought

<P>so too.&nbsp; We both thought it would be a comfort to you.

<P>But if you do not like it, there is no more to be said.

<P>She is no encumbrance here."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dear sister, if you consider my unhappy state, how can she

<P>be any comfort to me?&nbsp; Here am I, a poor desolate widow,

<P>deprived of the best of husbands, my health gone in attending

<P>and nursing him, my spirits still worse, all my peace

<P>in this world destroyed, with hardly enough to support

<P>me in the rank of a gentlewoman, and enable me to live

<P>so as not to disgrace the memory of the dear departed--

<P>what possible comfort could I have in taking such a charge

<P>upon me as Fanny?&nbsp; If I could wish it for my own sake,

<P>I would not do so unjust a thing by the poor girl.

<P>She is in good hands, and sure of doing well.&nbsp; I must

<P>struggle through my sorrows and difficulties as I can."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then you will not mind living by yourself quite alone?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Lady Bertram, I do not complain.&nbsp; I know I cannot

<P>live as I have done, but I must retrench where I can,

<P>and learn to be a better manager.&nbsp; I _have_ _been_

<P>a liberal housekeeper enough, but I shall not be ashamed

<P>to practise economy now.&nbsp; My situation is as much

<P>altered as my income.&nbsp; A great many things were due

<P>from poor Mr. Norris, as clergyman of the parish,

<P>that cannot be expected from me.&nbsp; It is unknown how much

<P>was consumed in our kitchen by odd comers and goers.

<P>At the White House, matters must be better looked after.

<P>I _must_ live within my income, or I shall be miserable;

<P>and I own it would give me great satisfaction to be able

<P>to do rather more, to lay by a little at the end of

<P>the year."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I dare say you will.&nbsp; You always do, don't you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My object, Lady Bertram, is to be of use to those that

<P>come after me.&nbsp; It is for your children's good that I

<P>wish to be richer.&nbsp; I have nobody else to care for,

<P>but I should be very glad to think I could leave a little

<P>trifle among them worth their having."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are very good, but do not trouble yourself about them.

<P>They are sure of being well provided for.&nbsp; Sir Thomas

<P>will take care of that."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why, you know, Sir Thomas's means will be rather straitened

<P>if the Antigua estate is to make such poor returns."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! _that_ will soon be settled.&nbsp; Sir Thomas has been

<P>writing about it, I know."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, Lady Bertram," said Mrs. Norris, moving to go,

<P>"I can only say that my sole desire is to be of use

<P>to your family:&nbsp; and so, if Sir Thomas should ever speak

<P>again about my taking Fanny, you will be able to say that

<P>my health and spirits put it quite out of the question;

<P>besides that, I really should not have a bed to give her,

<P>for I must keep a spare room for a friend."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Lady Bertram repeated enough of this conversation

<P>to her husband to convince him how much he had mistaken

<P>his sister-in-law's views; and she was from that moment

<P>perfectly safe from all expectation, or the slightest

<P>allusion to it from him.&nbsp; He could not but wonder at her

<P>refusing to do anything for a niece whom she had been so

<P>forward to adopt; but, as she took early care to make him,

<P>as well as Lady Bertram, understand that whatever she

<P>possessed was designed for their family, he soon grew

<P>reconciled to a distinction which, at the same time

<P>that it was advantageous and complimentary to them,

<P>would enable him better to provide for Fanny himself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny soon learnt how unnecessary had been her fears of a removal;

<P>and her spontaneous, untaught felicity on the discovery,

<P>conveyed some consolation to Edmund for his disappointment

<P>in what he had expected to be so essentially serviceable

<P>to her.&nbsp; Mrs. Norris took possession of the White House,

<P>the Grants arrived at the Parsonage, and these events over,

<P>everything at Mansfield went on for some time as usual.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The Grants showing a disposition to be friendly and sociable,

<P>gave great satisfaction in the main among their new acquaintance.

<P>They had their faults, and Mrs. Norris soon found them out.

<P>The Doctor was very fond of eating, and would have a good

<P>dinner every day; and Mrs. Grant, instead of contriving

<P>to gratify him at little expense, gave her cook as high

<P>wages as they did at Mansfield Park, and was scarcely ever

<P>seen in her offices.&nbsp; Mrs. Norris could not speak with any

<P>temper of such grievances, nor of the quantity of butter

<P>and eggs that were regularly consumed in the house.

<P>"Nobody loved plenty and hospitality more than herself;

<P>nobody more hated pitiful doings; the Parsonage,

<P>she believed, had never been wanting in comforts of any sort,

<P>had never borne a bad character in _her_ _time_, but this

<P>was a way of going on that she could not understand.

<P>A fine lady in a country parsonage was quite out of place.

<P>_Her_ store-room, she thought, might have been good enough

<P>for Mrs. Grant to go into.&nbsp; Inquire where she would,

<P>she could not find out that Mrs. Grant had ever had more

<P>than five thousand pounds."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Lady Bertram listened without much interest to this

<P>sort of invective.&nbsp; She could not enter into the wrongs

<P>of an economist, but she felt all the injuries of beauty

<P>in Mrs. Grant's being so well settled in life without

<P>being handsome, and expressed her astonishment on

<P>that point almost as often, though not so diffusely,

<P>as Mrs. Norris discussed the other.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>These opinions had been hardly canvassed a year before

<P>another event arose of such importance in the family,

<P>as might fairly claim some place in the thoughts and

<P>conversation of the ladies.&nbsp; Sir Thomas found it expedient

<P>to go to Antigua himself, for the better arrangement

<P>of his affairs, and he took his eldest son with him,

<P>in the hope of detaching him from some bad connexions

<P>at home.&nbsp; They left England with the probability of being

<P>nearly a twelvemonth absent.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The necessity of the measure in a pecuniary light,

<P>and the hope of its utility to his son, reconciled Sir

<P>Thomas to the effort of quitting the rest of his family,

<P>and of leaving his daughters to the direction of others

<P>at their present most interesting time of life.

<P>He could not think Lady Bertram quite equal to supply his

<P>place with them, or rather, to perform what should have

<P>been her own; but, in Mrs. Norris's watchful attention,

<P>and in Edmund's judgment, he had sufficient confidence

<P>to make him go without fears for their conduct.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Lady Bertram did not at all like to have her husband leave her;

<P>but she was not disturbed by any alarm for his safety,

<P>or solicitude for his comfort, being one of those persons

<P>who think nothing can be dangerous, or difficult,

<P>or fatiguing to anybody but themselves.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The Miss Bertrams were much to be pitied on the occasion:

<P>not for their sorrow, but for their want of it.

<P>Their father was no object of love to them; he had never

<P>seemed the friend of their pleasures, and his absence

<P>was unhappily most welcome.&nbsp; They were relieved by it from

<P>all restraint; and without aiming at one gratification

<P>that would probably have been forbidden by Sir Thomas,

<P>they felt themselves immediately at their own disposal,

<P>and to have every indulgence within their reach.

<P>Fanny's relief, and her consciousness of it, were quite

<P>equal to her cousins'; but a more tender nature suggested

<P>that her feelings were ungrateful, and she really

<P>grieved because she could not grieve.&nbsp; "Sir Thomas,

<P>who had done so much for her and her brothers, and who was

<P>gone perhaps never to return! that she should see him

<P>go without a tear! it was a shameful insensibility."

<P>He had said to her, moreover, on the very last morning,

<P>that he hoped she might see William again in the course

<P>of the ensuing winter, and had charged her to write

<P>and invite him to Mansfield as soon as the squadron

<P>to which he belonged should be known to be in England.

<P>"This was so thoughtful and kind!" and would he only

<P>have smiled upon her, and called her "my dear Fanny,"

<P>while he said it, every former frown or cold address

<P>might have been forgotten.&nbsp; But he had ended his speech

<P>in a way to sink her in sad mortification, by adding,

<P>"If William does come to Mansfield, I hope you may be able

<P>to convince him that the many years which have passed

<P>since you parted have not been spent on your side entirely

<P>without improvement; though, I fear, he must find his sister

<P>at sixteen in some respects too much like his sister at ten."

<P>She cried bitterly over this reflection when her uncle

<P>was gone; and her cousins, on seeing her with red eyes,

<P>set her down as a hypocrite.
