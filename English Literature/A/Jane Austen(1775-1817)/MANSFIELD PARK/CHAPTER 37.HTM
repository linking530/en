<P>Mr. Crawford gone, Sir Thomas's next object was that he

<P>should be missed; and he entertained great hope that his

<P>niece would find a blank in the loss of those attentions

<P>which at the time she had felt, or fancied, an evil.

<P>She had tasted of consequence in its most flattering form;

<P>and he did hope that the loss of it, the sinking again

<P>into nothing, would awaken very wholesome regrets

<P>in her mind.&nbsp; He watched her with this idea; but he

<P>could hardly tell with what success.&nbsp; He hardly knew

<P>whether there were any difference in her spirits or not.

<P>She was always so gentle and retiring that her emotions

<P>were beyond his discrimination.&nbsp; He did not understand her:

<P>he felt that he did not; and therefore applied to Edmund

<P>to tell him how she stood affected on the present occasion,

<P>and whether she were more or less happy than she

<P>had been.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Edmund did not discern any symptoms of regret, and thought

<P>his father a little unreasonable in supposing the first

<P>three or four days could produce any.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>What chiefly surprised Edmund was, that Crawford's sister,

<P>the friend and companion who had been so much to her,

<P>should not be more visibly regretted.&nbsp; He wondered that Fanny

<P>spoke so seldom of _her_, and had so little voluntarily

<P>to say of her concern at this separation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Alas! it was this sister, this friend and companion,

<P>who was now the chief bane of Fanny's comfort.&nbsp; If she

<P>could have believed Mary's future fate as unconnected

<P>with Mansfield as she was determined the brother's

<P>should be, if she could have hoped her return thither

<P>to be as distant as she was much inclined to think his,

<P>she would have been light of heart indeed; but the more

<P>she recollected and observed, the more deeply was she

<P>convinced that everything was now in a fairer train

<P>for Miss Crawford's marrying Edmund than it had ever

<P>been before.&nbsp; On his side the inclination was stronger,

<P>on hers less equivocal.&nbsp; His objections, the scruples of

<P>his integrity, seemed all done away, nobody could tell how;

<P>and the doubts and hesitations of her ambition were

<P>equally got over--and equally without apparent reason.

<P>It could only be imputed to increasing attachment.

<P>His good and her bad feelings yielded to love, and such

<P>love must unite them.&nbsp; He was to go to town as soon as

<P>some business relative to Thornton Lacey were completed--

<P>perhaps within a fortnight; he talked of going,

<P>he loved to talk of it; and when once with her again,

<P>Fanny could not doubt the rest.&nbsp; Her acceptance must

<P>be as certain as his offer; and yet there were bad

<P>feelings still remaining which made the prospect of it

<P>most sorrowful to her, independently, she believed,

<P>independently of self.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In their very last conversation, Miss Crawford, in spite

<P>of some amiable sensations, and much personal kindness,

<P>had still been Miss Crawford; still shewn a mind led astray

<P>and bewildered, and without any suspicion of being so;

<P>darkened, yet fancying itself light.&nbsp; She might love,

<P>but she did not deserve Edmund by any other sentiment.

<P>Fanny believed there was scarcely a second feeling

<P>in common between them; and she may be forgiven by older

<P>sages for looking on the chance of Miss Crawford's future

<P>improvement as nearly desperate, for thinking that if Edmund's

<P>influence in this season of love had already done so little

<P>in clearing her judgment, and regulating her notions,

<P>his worth would be finally wasted on her even in years

<P>of matrimony.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Experience might have hoped more for any young people

<P>so circumstanced, and impartiality would not have denied

<P>to Miss Crawford's nature that participation of the general

<P>nature of women which would lead her to adopt the opinions

<P>of the man she loved and respected as her own.&nbsp; But as such

<P>were Fanny's persuasions, she suffered very much from them,

<P>and could never speak of Miss Crawford without pain.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sir Thomas, meanwhile, went on with his own hopes and

<P>his own observations, still feeling a right, by all his

<P>knowledge of human nature, to expect to see the effect

<P>of the loss of power and consequence on his niece's spirits,

<P>and the past attentions of the lover producing a craving

<P>for their return; and he was soon afterwards able to account

<P>for his not yet completely and indubitably seeing all this,

<P>by the prospect of another visitor, whose approach he

<P>could allow to be quite enough to support the spirits

<P>he was watching.&nbsp; William had obtained a ten days'

<P>leave of absence, to be given to Northamptonshire,

<P>and was coming, the happiest of lieutenants, because the

<P>latest made, to shew his happiness and describe his uniform.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He came; and he would have been delighted to shew his uniform

<P>there too, had not cruel custom prohibited its appearance

<P>except on duty.&nbsp; So the uniform remained at Portsmouth,

<P>and Edmund conjectured that before Fanny had any chance

<P>of seeing it, all its own freshness and all the freshness

<P>of its wearer's feelings must be worn away.&nbsp; It would be sunk

<P>into a badge of disgrace; for what can be more unbecoming,

<P>or more worthless, than the uniform of a lieutenant,

<P>who has been a lieutenant a year or two, and sees

<P>others made commanders before him?&nbsp; So reasoned Edmund,

<P>till his father made him the confidant of a scheme which

<P>placed Fanny's chance of seeing the second lieutenant

<P>of H.M.S. Thrush in all his glory in another light.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This scheme was that she should accompany her brother

<P>back to Portsmouth, and spend a little time with her

<P>own family.&nbsp; It had occurred to Sir Thomas, in one of his

<P>dignified musings, as a right and desirable measure;

<P>but before he absolutely made up his mind, he consulted

<P>his son.&nbsp; Edmund considered it every way, and saw nothing

<P>but what was right.&nbsp; The thing was good in itself,

<P>and could not be done at a better time; and he had no doubt

<P>of it being highly agreeable to Fanny.&nbsp; This was enough

<P>to determine Sir Thomas; and a decisive "then so it shall be"

<P>closed that stage of the business; Sir Thomas retiring

<P>from it with some feelings of satisfaction, and views

<P>of good over and above what he had communicated to his son;

<P>for his prime motive in sending her away had very little

<P>to do with the propriety of her seeing her parents again,

<P>and nothing at all with any idea of making her happy.

<P>He certainly wished her to go willingly, but he as certainly

<P>wished her to be heartily sick of home before her visit ended;

<P>and that a little abstinence from the elegancies and luxuries

<P>of Mansfield Park would bring her mind into a sober state,

<P>and incline her to a juster estimate of the value

<P>of that home of greater permanence, and equal comfort,

<P>of which she had the offer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was a medicinal project upon his niece's understanding,

<P>which he must consider as at present diseased.

<P>A residence of eight or nine years in the abode of wealth

<P>and plenty had a little disordered her powers of comparing

<P>and judging.&nbsp; Her father's house would, in all probability,

<P>teach her the value of a good income; and he trusted that

<P>she would be the wiser and happier woman, all her life,

<P>for the experiment he had devised.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Had Fanny been at all addicted to raptures, she must have

<P>had a strong attack of them when she first understood

<P>what was intended, when her uncle first made her the offer

<P>of visiting the parents, and brothers, and sisters,

<P>from whom she had been divided almost half her life;

<P>of returning for a couple of months to the scenes of

<P>her infancy, with William for the protector and companion

<P>of her journey, and the certainty of continuing to see

<P>William to the last hour of his remaining on land.

<P>Had she ever given way to bursts of delight, it must have

<P>been then, for she was delighted, but her happiness was

<P>of a quiet, deep, heart-swelling sort; and though never

<P>a great talker, she was always more inclined to silence

<P>when feeling most strongly.&nbsp; At the moment she could

<P>only thank and accept.&nbsp; Afterwards, when familiarised

<P>with the visions of enjoyment so suddenly opened, she could

<P>speak more largely to William and Edmund of what she felt;

<P>but still there were emotions of tenderness that could

<P>not be clothed in words.&nbsp; The remembrance of all her

<P>earliest pleasures, and of what she had suffered in being

<P>torn from them, came over her with renewed strength,

<P>and it seemed as if to be at home again would heal

<P>every pain that had since grown out of the separation.

<P>To be in the centre of such a circle, loved by so many,

<P>and more loved by all than she had ever been before;

<P>to feel affection without fear or restraint; to feel

<P>herself the equal of those who surrounded her; to be at

<P>peace from all mention of the Crawfords, safe from every

<P>look which could be fancied a reproach on their account.

<P>This was a prospect to be dwelt on with a fondness that could

<P>be but half acknowledged.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Edmund, too--to be two months from _him_ (and perhaps

<P>she might be allowed to make her absence three)

<P>must do her good.&nbsp; At a distance, unassailed by his looks

<P>or his kindness, and safe from the perpetual irritation

<P>of knowing his heart, and striving to avoid his confidence,

<P>she should be able to reason herself into a properer state;

<P>she should be able to think of him as in London,

<P>and arranging everything there, without wretchedness.

<P>What might have been hard to bear at Mansfield was to become

<P>a slight evil at Portsmouth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The only drawback was the doubt of her aunt Bertram's being

<P>comfortable without her.&nbsp; She was of use to no one else;

<P>but _there_ she might be missed to a degree that she did

<P>not like to think of; and that part of the arrangement

<P>was, indeed, the hardest for Sir Thomas to accomplish,

<P>and what only _he_ could have accomplished at all.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But he was master at Mansfield Park.&nbsp; When he had really

<P>resolved on any measure, he could always carry it through;

<P>and now by dint of long talking on the subject,

<P>explaining and dwelling on the duty of Fanny's sometimes

<P>seeing her family, he did induce his wife to let her go;

<P>obtaining it rather from submission, however, than conviction,

<P>for Lady Bertram was convinced of very little more than

<P>that Sir Thomas thought Fanny ought to go, and therefore

<P>that she must.&nbsp; In the calmness of her own dressing-room,

<P>in the impartial flow of her own meditations, unbiassed by

<P>his bewildering statements, she could not acknowledge any

<P>necessity for Fanny's ever going near a father and mother

<P>who had done without her so long, while she was so useful

<P>to herself And as to the not missing her, which under

<P>Mrs. Norris's discussion was the point attempted to be proved,

<P>she set herself very steadily against admitting any such thing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sir Thomas had appealed to her reason, conscience, and dignity.

<P>He called it a sacrifice, and demanded it of her goodness

<P>and self-command as such.&nbsp; But Mrs. Norris wanted to persuade

<P>her that Fanny could be very well spared--_she_ being

<P>ready to give up all her own time to her as requested--

<P>and, in short, could not really be wanted or missed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That may be, sister," was all Lady Bertram's reply.

<P>"I dare say you are very right; but I am sure I shall miss

<P>her very much."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The next step was to communicate with Portsmouth.&nbsp; Fanny wrote

<P>to offer herself; and her mother's answer, though short,

<P>was so kind--a few simple lines expressed so natural and

<P>motherly a joy in the prospect of seeing her child again,

<P>as to confirm all the daughter's views of happiness in

<P>being with her--convincing her that she should now find

<P>a warm and affectionate friend in the "mama" who had

<P>certainly shewn no remarkable fondness for her formerly;

<P>but this she could easily suppose to have been her own

<P>fault or her own fancy.&nbsp; She had probably alienated love

<P>by the helplessness and fretfulness of a fearful temper,

<P>or been unreasonable in wanting a larger share than

<P>any one among so many could deserve.&nbsp; Now, when she

<P>knew better how to be useful, and how to forbear,

<P>and when her mother could be no longer occupied by the

<P>incessant demands of a house full of little children,

<P>there would be leisure and inclination for every comfort,

<P>and they should soon be what mother and daughter ought

<P>to be to each other.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>William was almost as happy in the plan as his sister.

<P>It would be the greatest pleasure to him to have her there

<P>to the last moment before he sailed, and perhaps find

<P>her there still when he came in from his first cruise.

<P>And besides, he wanted her so very much to see the Thrush

<P>before she went out of harbour--the Thrush was certainly

<P>the finest sloop in the service--and there were several

<P>improvements in the dockyard, too, which he quite longed to

<P>shew her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He did not scruple to add that her being at home

<P>for a while would be a great advantage to everybody.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not know how it is," said he; "but we seem to want

<P>some of your nice ways and orderliness at my father's. The

<P>house is always in confusion.&nbsp; You will set things going

<P>in a better way, I am sure.&nbsp; You will tell my mother how it

<P>all ought to be, and you will be so useful to Susan, and you

<P>will teach Betsey, and make the boys love and mind you.

<P>How right and comfortable it will all be!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>By the time Mrs. Price's answer arrived, there remained

<P>but a very few days more to be spent at Mansfield;

<P>and for part of one of those days the young travellers

<P>were in a good deal of alarm on the subject of their

<P>journey, for when the mode of it came to be talked of,

<P>and Mrs. Norris found that all her anxiety to save her

<P>brother-in-law's money was vain, and that in spite of her

<P>wishes and hints for a less expensive conveyance of Fanny,

<P>they were to travel post; when she saw Sir Thomas actually

<P>give William notes for the purpose, she was struck with

<P>the idea of there being room for a third in the carriage,

<P>and suddenly seized with a strong inclination to go

<P>with them, to go and see her poor dear sister Price.

<P>She proclaimed her thoughts.&nbsp; She must say that she

<P>had more than half a mind to go with the young people;

<P>it would be such an indulgence to her; she had not seen

<P>her poor dear sister Price for more than twenty years;

<P>and it would be a help to the young people in their journey

<P>to have her older head to manage for them; and she could

<P>not help thinking her poor dear sister Price would feel it

<P>very unkind of her not to come by such an opportunity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>William and Fanny were horror-struck at the idea.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>All the comfort of their comfortable journey would

<P>be destroyed at once.&nbsp; With woeful countenances they

<P>looked at each other.&nbsp; Their suspense lasted an hour

<P>or two.&nbsp; No one interfered to encourage or dissuade.

<P>Mrs. Norris was left to settle the matter by herself;

<P>and it ended, to the infinite joy of her nephew and niece,

<P>in the recollection that she could not possibly be spared

<P>from Mansfield Park at present; that she was a great deal

<P>too necessary to Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram for her to be

<P>able to answer it to herself to leave them even for a week,

<P>and therefore must certainly sacrifice every other pleasure

<P>to that of being useful to them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It had, in fact, occurred to her, that though taken

<P>to Portsmouth for nothing, it would be hardly possible

<P>for her to avoid paying her own expenses back again.

<P>So her poor dear sister Price was left to all the

<P>disappointment of her missing such an opportunity,

<P>and another twenty years' absence, perhaps, begun.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Edmund's plans were affected by this Portsmouth journey,

<P>this absence of Fanny's. He too had a sacrifice to make

<P>to Mansfield Park as well as his aunt.&nbsp; He had intended,

<P>about this time, to be going to London; but he could

<P>not leave his father and mother just when everybody else

<P>of most importance to their comfort was leaving them;

<P>and with an effort, felt but not boasted of, he delayed

<P>for a week or two longer a journey which he was looking

<P>forward to with the hope of its fixing his happiness

<P>for ever.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He told Fanny of it.&nbsp; She knew so much already,

<P>that she must know everything.&nbsp; It made the substance

<P>of one other confidential discourse about Miss Crawford;

<P>and Fanny was the more affected from feeling it to be

<P>the last time in which Miss Crawford's name would ever

<P>be mentioned between them with any remains of liberty.

<P>Once afterwards she was alluded to by him.&nbsp; Lady Bertram had

<P>been telling her niece in the evening to write to her soon

<P>and often, and promising to be a good correspondent herself;

<P>and Edmund, at a convenient moment, then added in a whisper,

<P>"And _I_ shall write to you, Fanny, when I have anything

<P>worth writing about, anything to say that I think you

<P>will like to hear, and that you will not hear so soon

<P>from any other quarter."&nbsp; Had she doubted his meaning

<P>while she listened, the glow in his face, when she looked

<P>up at him, would have been decisive.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For this letter she must try to arm herself.&nbsp; That a

<P>letter from Edmund should be a subject of terror!

<P>She began to feel that she had not yet gone through all

<P>the changes of opinion and sentiment which the progress

<P>of time and variation of circumstances occasion in this

<P>world of changes.&nbsp; The vicissitudes of the human mind

<P>had not yet been exhausted by her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Poor Fanny! though going as she did willingly and eagerly,

<P>the last evening at Mansfield Park must still

<P>be wretchedness.&nbsp; Her heart was completely sad at parting.

<P>She had tears for every room in the house, much more

<P>for every beloved inhabitant.&nbsp; She clung to her aunt,

<P>because she would miss her; she kissed the hand of her

<P>uncle with struggling sobs, because she had displeased him;

<P>and as for Edmund, she could neither speak, nor look,

<P>nor think, when the last moment came with _him_; and it

<P>was not till it was over that she knew he was giving

<P>her the affectionate farewell of a brother.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>All this passed overnight, for the journey was to

<P>begin very early in the morning; and when the small,

<P>diminished party met at breakfast, William and Fanny

<P>were talked of as already advanced one stage.
