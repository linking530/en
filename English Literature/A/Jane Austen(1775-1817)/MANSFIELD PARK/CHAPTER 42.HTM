<P>The Prices were just setting off for church the next day

<P>when Mr. Crawford appeared again.&nbsp; He came, not to stop,

<P>but to join them; he was asked to go with them to the

<P>Garrison chapel, which was exactly what he had intended,

<P>and they all walked thither together.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The family were now seen to advantage.&nbsp; Nature had given

<P>them no inconsiderable share of beauty, and every Sunday

<P>dressed them in their cleanest skins and best attire.

<P>Sunday always brought this comfort to Fanny, and on this

<P>Sunday she felt it more than ever.&nbsp; Her poor mother now

<P>did not look so very unworthy of being Lady Bertram's

<P>sister as she was but too apt to look.&nbsp; It often grieved

<P>her to the heart to think of the contrast between them;

<P>to think that where nature had made so little difference,

<P>circumstances should have made so much, and that her mother,

<P>as handsome as Lady Bertram, and some years her junior,

<P>should have an appearance so much more worn and faded,

<P>so comfortless, so slatternly, so shabby.&nbsp; But Sunday

<P>made her a very creditable and tolerably cheerful-looking

<P>Mrs. Price, coming abroad with a fine family of children,

<P>feeling a little respite of her weekly cares, and only

<P>discomposed if she saw her boys run into danger, or Rebecca

<P>pass by with a flower in her hat.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In chapel they were obliged to divide, but Mr. Crawford

<P>took care not to be divided from the female branch;

<P>and after chapel he still continued with them, and made

<P>one in the family party on the ramparts.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Price took her weekly walk on the ramparts every

<P>fine Sunday throughout the year, always going directly

<P>after morning service and staying till dinner-time. It

<P>was her public place:&nbsp; there she met her acquaintance,

<P>heard a little news, talked over the badness of the

<P>Portsmouth servants, and wound up her spirits for the six

<P>days ensuing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Thither they now went; Mr. Crawford most happy to consider

<P>the Miss Prices as his peculiar charge; and before they

<P>had been there long, somehow or other, there was no

<P>saying how, Fanny could not have believed it, but he

<P>was walking between them with an arm of each under his,

<P>and she did not know how to prevent or put an end to it.

<P>It made her uncomfortable for a time, but yet there

<P>were enjoyments in the day and in the view which would

<P>be felt.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The day was uncommonly lovely.&nbsp; It was really March;

<P>but it was April in its mild air, brisk soft wind,

<P>and bright sun, occasionally clouded for a minute;

<P>and everything looked so beautiful under the influence

<P>of such a sky, the effects of the shadows pursuing each

<P>other on the ships at Spithead and the island beyond,

<P>with the ever-varying hues of the sea, now at high water,

<P>dancing in its glee and dashing against the ramparts with

<P>so fine a sound, produced altogether such a combination

<P>of charms for Fanny, as made her gradually almost careless

<P>of the circumstances under which she felt them.&nbsp; Nay, had she

<P>been without his arm, she would soon have known that she

<P>needed it, for she wanted strength for a two hours'

<P>saunter of this kind, coming, as it generally did,

<P>upon a week's previous inactivity.&nbsp; Fanny was beginning

<P>to feel the effect of being debarred from her usual

<P>regular exercise; she had lost ground as to health

<P>since her being in Portsmouth; and but for Mr. Crawford

<P>and the beauty of the weather would soon have been knocked

<P>up now.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The loveliness of the day, and of the view, he felt

<P>like herself.&nbsp; They often stopt with the same sentiment

<P>and taste, leaning against the wall, some minutes,

<P>to look and admire; and considering he was not Edmund,

<P>Fanny could not but allow that he was sufficiently open

<P>to the charms of nature, and very well able to express

<P>his admiration.&nbsp; She had a few tender reveries now and then,

<P>which he could sometimes take advantage of to look in her

<P>face without detection; and the result of these looks was,

<P>that though as bewitching as ever, her face was less

<P>blooming than it ought to be.&nbsp; She _said_ she was

<P>very well, and did not like to be supposed otherwise;

<P>but take it all in all, he was convinced that her present

<P>residence could not be comfortable, and therefore could

<P>not be salutary for her, and he was growing anxious for

<P>her being again at Mansfield, where her own happiness,

<P>and his in seeing her, must be so much greater.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You have been here a month, I think?" said he.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No; not quite a month.&nbsp; It is only four weeks to-morrow

<P>since I left Mansfield."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are a most accurate and honest reckoner.&nbsp; I should

<P>call that a month."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I did not arrive here till Tuesday evening."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And it is to be a two months' visit, is not?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes.&nbsp; My uncle talked of two months.&nbsp; I suppose it

<P>will not be less."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And how are you to be conveyed back again?&nbsp; Who comes

<P>for you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not know.&nbsp; I have heard nothing about it yet

<P>from my aunt.&nbsp; Perhaps I may be to stay longer.

<P>It may not be convenient for me to be fetched exactly

<P>at the two months' end."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After a moment's reflection, Mr. Crawford replied,

<P>"I know Mansfield, I know its way, I know its faults

<P>towards _you_.&nbsp; I know the danger of your being so

<P>far forgotten, as to have your comforts give way to the

<P>imaginary convenience of any single being in the family.

<P>I am aware that you may be left here week after week,

<P>if Sir Thomas cannot settle everything for coming himself,

<P>or sending your aunt's maid for you, without involving

<P>the slightest alteration of the arrangements which he

<P>may have laid down for the next quarter of a year.

<P>This will not do.&nbsp; Two months is an ample allowance;

<P>I should think six weeks quite enough.&nbsp; I am considering

<P>your sister's health," said he, addressing himself to Susan,

<P>"which I think the confinement of Portsmouth unfavourable to.

<P>She requires constant air and exercise.&nbsp; When you know her

<P>as well as I do, I am sure you will agree that she does,

<P>and that she ought never to be long banished from the free air

<P>and liberty of the country.&nbsp; If, therefore" (turning again

<P>to Fanny), "you find yourself growing unwell, and any

<P>difficulties arise about your returning to Mansfield,

<P>without waiting for the two months to be ended,

<P>_that_ must not be regarded as of any consequence,

<P>if you feel yourself at all less strong or comfortable

<P>than usual, and will only let my sister know it, give her

<P>only the slightest hint, she and I will immediately

<P>come down, and take you back to Mansfield.&nbsp; You know

<P>the ease and the pleasure with which this would be done.

<P>You know all that would be felt on the occasion."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny thanked him, but tried to laugh it off.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am perfectly serious," he replied, "as you perfectly know.

<P>And I hope you will not be cruelly concealing any

<P>tendency to indisposition.&nbsp; Indeed, you shall _not_;

<P>it shall not be in your power; for so long only as you

<P>positively say, in every letter to Mary, 'I am well,'

<P>and I know you cannot speak or write a falsehood, so long

<P>only shall you be considered as well."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny thanked him again, but was affected and distressed

<P>to a degree that made it impossible for her to say much,

<P>or even to be certain of what she ought to say.

<P>This was towards the close of their walk.&nbsp; He attended

<P>them to the last, and left them only at the door of their

<P>own house, when he knew them to be going to dinner,

<P>and therefore pretended to be waited for elsewhere.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I wish you were not so tired," said he, still detaining

<P>Fanny after all the others were in the house--"I wish I

<P>left you in stronger health.&nbsp; Is there anything I can

<P>do for you in town?&nbsp; I have half an idea of going into

<P>Norfolk again soon.&nbsp; I am not satisfied about Maddison.

<P>I am sure he still means to impose on me if possible,

<P>and get a cousin of his own into a certain mill, which I

<P>design for somebody else.&nbsp; I must come to an understanding

<P>with him.&nbsp; I must make him know that I will not be

<P>tricked on the south side of Everingham, any more than on

<P>the north:&nbsp; that I will be master of my own property.

<P>I was not explicit enough with him before.&nbsp; The mischief

<P>such a man does on an estate, both as to the credit of his

<P>employer and the welfare of the poor, is inconceivable.

<P>I have a great mind to go back into Norfolk directly,

<P>and put everything at once on such a footing as cannot

<P>be afterwards swerved from.&nbsp; Maddison is a clever fellow;

<P>I do not wish to displace him, provided he does not try

<P>to displace _me_; but it would be simple to be duped

<P>by a man who has no right of creditor to dupe me,

<P>and worse than simple to let him give me a hard-hearted,

<P>griping fellow for a tenant, instead of an honest man,

<P>to whom I have given half a promise already.&nbsp; Would it not

<P>be worse than simple?&nbsp; Shall I go?&nbsp; Do you advise it?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I advise!&nbsp; You know very well what is right."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes.&nbsp; When you give me your opinion, I always know

<P>what is right.&nbsp; Your judgment is my rule of right."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, no! do not say so.&nbsp; We have all a better guide

<P>in ourselves, if we would attend to it, than any other person

<P>can be.&nbsp; Good-bye; I wish you a pleasant journey to-morrow."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Is there nothing I can do for you in town?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nothing; I am much obliged to you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Have you no message for anybody?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My love to your sister, if you please; and when you see

<P>my cousin, my cousin Edmund, I wish you would be so good

<P>as to say that I suppose I shall soon hear from him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Certainly; and if he is lazy or negligent, I will write

<P>his excuses myself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He could say no more, for Fanny would be no longer detained.

<P>He pressed her hand, looked at her, and was gone.

<P>_He_ went to while away the next three hours as he could,

<P>with his other acquaintance, till the best dinner that

<P>a capital inn afforded was ready for their enjoyment,

<P>and _she_ turned in to her more simple one immediately.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Their general fare bore a very different character;

<P>and could he have suspected how many privations, besides that

<P>of exercise, she endured in her father's house, he would

<P>have wondered that her looks were not much more affected

<P>than he found them.&nbsp; She was so little equal to Rebecca's

<P>puddings and Rebecca's hashes, brought to table, as they

<P>all were, with such accompaniments of half-cleaned plates,

<P>and not half-cleaned knives and forks, that she was very

<P>often constrained to defer her heartiest meal till she could

<P>send her brothers in the evening for biscuits and buns.

<P>After being nursed up at Mansfield, it was too late in the

<P>day to be hardened at Portsmouth; and though Sir Thomas,

<P>had he known all, might have thought his niece in the

<P>most promising way of being starved, both mind and body,

<P>into a much juster value for Mr. Crawford's good company

<P>and good fortune, he would probably have feared to push

<P>his experiment farther, lest she might die under the cure.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny was out of spirits all the rest of the day.

<P>Though tolerably secure of not seeing Mr. Crawford again,

<P>she could not help being low.&nbsp; It was parting with somebody

<P>of the nature of a friend; and though, in one light,

<P>glad to have him gone, it seemed as if she was now

<P>deserted by everybody; it was a sort of renewed separation

<P>from Mansfield; and she could not think of his returning

<P>to town, and being frequently with Mary and Edmund,

<P>without feelings so near akin to envy as made her hate

<P>herself for having them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her dejection had no abatement from anything passing

<P>around her; a friend or two of her father's, as always

<P>happened if he was not with them, spent the long,

<P>long evening there; and from six o'clock till half-past nine,

<P>there was little intermission of noise or grog.&nbsp; She was

<P>very low.&nbsp; The wonderful improvement which she still

<P>fancied in Mr. Crawford was the nearest to administering

<P>comfort of anything within the current of her thoughts.

<P>Not considering in how different a circle she had been

<P>just seeing him, nor how much might be owing to contrast,

<P>she was quite persuaded of his being astonishingly

<P>more gentle and regardful of others than formerly.

<P>And, if in little things, must it not be so in great?

<P>So anxious for her health and comfort, so very feeling

<P>as he now expressed himself, and really seemed, might not

<P>it be fairly supposed that he would not much longer

<P>persevere in a suit so distressing to her?
