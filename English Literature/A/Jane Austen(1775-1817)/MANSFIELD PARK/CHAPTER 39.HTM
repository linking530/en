<P>Could Sir Thomas have seen all his niece's feelings,

<P>when she wrote her first letter to her aunt, he would

<P>not have despaired; for though a good night's rest,

<P>a pleasant morning, the hope of soon seeing William again,

<P>and the comparatively quiet state of the house, from Tom

<P>and Charles being gone to school, Sam on some project of

<P>his own, and her father on his usual lounges, enabled her

<P>to express herself cheerfully on the subject of home,

<P>there were still, to her own perfect consciousness,

<P>many drawbacks suppressed.&nbsp; Could he have seen only half

<P>that she felt before the end of a week, he would have

<P>thought Mr. Crawford sure of her, and been delighted with

<P>his own sagacity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Before the week ended, it was all disappointment.

<P>In the first place, William was gone.&nbsp; The Thrush

<P>had had her orders, the wind had changed, and he was

<P>sailed within four days from their reaching Portsmouth;

<P>and during those days she had seen him only twice,

<P>in a short and hurried way, when he had come ashore

<P>on duty.&nbsp; There had been no free conversation, no walk

<P>on the ramparts, no visit to the dockyard, no acquaintance

<P>with the Thrush, nothing of all that they had planned

<P>and depended on.&nbsp; Everything in that quarter failed her,

<P>except William's affection.&nbsp; His last thought on leaving

<P>home was for her.&nbsp; He stepped back again to the door

<P>to say, "Take care of Fanny, mother.&nbsp; She is tender,

<P>and not used to rough it like the rest of us.&nbsp; I charge you,

<P>take care of Fanny."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>William was gone:&nbsp; and the home he had left her in was,

<P>Fanny could not conceal it from herself, in almost every

<P>respect the very reverse of what she could have wished.

<P>It was the abode of noise, disorder, and impropriety.

<P>Nobody was in their right place, nothing was done as it ought

<P>to be.&nbsp; She could not respect her parents as she had hoped.

<P>On her father, her confidence had not been sanguine, but he

<P>was more negligent of his family, his habits were worse,

<P>and his manners coarser, than she had been prepared for.

<P>He did not want abilities but he had no curiosity,

<P>and no information beyond his profession; he read only

<P>the newspaper and the navy-list; he talked only of

<P>the dockyard, the harbour, Spithead, and the Motherbank;

<P>he swore and he drank, he was dirty and gross.

<P>She had never been able to recall anything approaching

<P>to tenderness in his former treatment of herself.

<P>There had remained only a general impression of roughness

<P>and loudness; and now he scarcely ever noticed her,

<P>but to make her the object of a coarse joke.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her disappointment in her mother was greater:

<P>_there_ she had hoped much, and found almost nothing.

<P>Every flattering scheme of being of consequence to her

<P>soon fell to the ground.&nbsp; Mrs. Price was not unkind;

<P>but, instead of gaining on her affection and confidence,

<P>and becoming more and more dear, her daughter never met

<P>with greater kindness from her than on the first day of

<P>her arrival.&nbsp; The instinct of nature was soon satisfied,

<P>and Mrs. Price's attachment had no other source.

<P>Her heart and her time were already quite full;

<P>she had neither leisure nor affection to bestow on Fanny.

<P>Her daughters never had been much to her.&nbsp; She was fond

<P>of her sons, especially of William, but Betsey was the first

<P>of her girls whom she had ever much regarded.&nbsp; To her she

<P>was most injudiciously indulgent.&nbsp; William was her pride;

<P>Betsey her darling; and John, Richard, Sam, Tom, and Charles

<P>occupied all the rest of her maternal solicitude, alternately

<P>her worries and her comforts.&nbsp; These shared her heart:

<P>her time was given chiefly to her house and her servants.

<P>Her days were spent in a kind of slow bustle; all was busy

<P>without getting on, always behindhand and lamenting it,

<P>without altering her ways; wishing to be an economist,

<P>without contrivance or regularity; dissatisfied with

<P>her servants, without skill to make them better,

<P>and whether helping, or reprimanding, or indulging them,

<P>without any power of engaging their respect.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Of her two sisters, Mrs. Price very much more resembled Lady

<P>Bertram than Mrs. Norris.&nbsp; She was a manager by necessity,

<P>without any of Mrs. Norris's inclination for it, or any

<P>of her activity.&nbsp; Her disposition was naturally easy

<P>and indolent, like Lady Bertram's; and a situation of similar

<P>affluence and do-nothingness would have been much more

<P>suited to her capacity than the exertions and self-denials

<P>of the one which her imprudent marriage had placed her in.

<P>She might have made just as good a woman of consequence

<P>as Lady Bertram, but Mrs. Norris would have been a more

<P>respectable mother of nine children on a small income.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Much of all this Fanny could not but be sensible of.

<P>She might scruple to make use of the words, but she

<P>must and did feel that her mother was a partial,

<P>ill-judging parent, a dawdle, a slattern, who neither taught

<P>nor restrained her children, whose house was the scene

<P>of mismanagement and discomfort from beginning to end,

<P>and who had no talent, no conversation, no affection

<P>towards herself; no curiosity to know her better,

<P>no desire of her friendship, and no inclination for her

<P>company that could lessen her sense of such feelings.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny was very anxious to be useful, and not to appear above

<P>her home, or in any way disqualified or disinclined, by her

<P>foreign education, from contributing her help to its comforts,

<P>and therefore set about working for Sam immediately;

<P>and by working early and late, with perseverance and

<P>great despatch, did so much that the boy was shipped

<P>off at last, with more than half his linen ready.

<P>She had great pleasure in feeling her usefulness, but could

<P>not conceive how they would have managed without her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sam, loud and overbearing as he was, she rather regretted

<P>when he went, for he was clever and intelligent, and glad

<P>to be employed in any errand in the town; and though

<P>spurning the remonstrances of Susan, given as they were,

<P>though very reasonable in themselves, with ill-timed

<P>and powerless warmth, was beginning to be influenced

<P>by Fanny's services and gentle persuasions; and she found

<P>that the best of the three younger ones was gone in him:

<P>Tom and Charles being at least as many years as they were

<P>his juniors distant from that age of feeling and reason,

<P>which might suggest the expediency of making friends,

<P>and of endeavouring to be less disagreeable.&nbsp; Their sister

<P>soon despaired of making the smallest impression on _them_;

<P>they were quite untameable by any means of address which she

<P>had spirits or time to attempt.&nbsp; Every afternoon brought

<P>a return of their riotous games all over the house; and she

<P>very early learned to sigh at the approach of Saturday's

<P>constant half-holiday.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Betsey, too, a spoiled child, trained up to think the

<P>alphabet her greatest enemy, left to be with the servants

<P>at her pleasure, and then encouraged to report any evil

<P>of them, she was almost as ready to despair of being

<P>able to love or assist; and of Susan's temper she had

<P>many doubts.&nbsp; Her continual disagreements with her mother,

<P>her rash squabbles with Tom and Charles, and petulance

<P>with Betsey, were at least so distressing to Fanny that,

<P>though admitting they were by no means without provocation,

<P>she feared the disposition that could push them to such

<P>length must be far from amiable, and from affording

<P>any repose to herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Such was the home which was to put Mansfield out of

<P>her head, and teach her to think of her cousin Edmund with

<P>moderated feelings.&nbsp; On the contrary, she could think of

<P>nothing but Mansfield, its beloved inmates, its happy ways.

<P>Everything where she now was in full contrast to it.

<P>The elegance, propriety, regularity, harmony, and perhaps,

<P>above all, the peace and tranquillity of Mansfield,

<P>were brought to her remembrance every hour of the day,

<P>by the prevalence of everything opposite to them _here_.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The living in incessant noise was, to a frame and temper

<P>delicate and nervous like Fanny's, an evil which no

<P>superadded elegance or harmony could have entirely

<P>atoned for.&nbsp; It was the greatest misery of all.

<P>At Mansfield, no sounds of contention, no raised voice,

<P>no abrupt bursts, no tread of violence, was ever heard;

<P>all proceeded in a regular course of cheerful orderliness;

<P>everybody had their due importance; everybody's feelings

<P>were consulted.&nbsp; If tenderness could be ever supposed wanting,

<P>good sense and good breeding supplied its place; and as to

<P>the little irritations sometimes introduced by aunt Norris,

<P>they were short, they were trifling, they were as a drop

<P>of water to the ocean, compared with the ceaseless

<P>tumult of her present abode.&nbsp; Here everybody was noisy,

<P>every voice was loud (excepting, perhaps, her mother's,

<P>which resembled the soft monotony of Lady Bertram's,

<P>only worn into fretfulness). Whatever was wanted was

<P>hallooed for, and the servants hallooed out their excuses

<P>from the kitchen.&nbsp; The doors were in constant banging,

<P>the stairs were never at rest, nothing was done without

<P>a clatter, nobody sat still, and nobody could command

<P>attention when they spoke.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In a review of the two houses, as they appeared to her

<P>before the end of a week, Fanny was tempted to apply

<P>to them Dr. Johnson's celebrated judgment as to matrimony

<P>and celibacy, and say, that though Mansfield Park might

<P>have some pains, Portsmouth could have no pleasures.
