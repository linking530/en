<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>Tom Bertram had of late spent so little of his time at

<P>home that he could be only nominally missed; and Lady

<P>Bertram was soon astonished to find how very well they

<P>did even without his father, how well Edmund could

<P>supply his place in carving, talking to the steward,

<P>writing to the attorney, settling with the servants,

<P>and equally saving her from all possible fatigue or exertion

<P>in every particular but that of directing her letters.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The earliest intelligence of the travellers' safe arrival

<P>at Antigua, after a favourable voyage, was received;

<P>though not before Mrs. Norris had been indulging in very

<P>dreadful fears, and trying to make Edmund participate them

<P>whenever she could get him alone; and as she depended

<P>on being the first person made acquainted with any

<P>fatal catastrophe, she had already arranged the manner of

<P>breaking it to all the others, when Sir Thomas's assurances

<P>of their both being alive and well made it necessary to lay

<P>by her agitation and affectionate preparatory speeches for a while.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The winter came and passed without their being

<P>called for; the accounts continued perfectly good;

<P>and Mrs. Norris, in promoting gaieties for her nieces,

<P>assisting their toilets, displaying their accomplishments,

<P>and looking about for their future husbands, had so much

<P>to do as, in addition to all her own household cares,

<P>some interference in those of her sister, and Mrs. Grant's

<P>wasteful doings to overlook, left her very little occasion

<P>to be occupied in fears for the absent.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The Miss Bertrams were now fully established among the

<P>belles of the neighbourhood; and as they joined to beauty

<P>and brilliant acquirements a manner naturally easy,

<P>and carefully formed to general civility and obligingness,

<P>they possessed its favour as well as its admiration.

<P>Their vanity was in such good order that they seemed

<P>to be quite free from it, and gave themselves no airs;

<P>while the praises attending such behaviour, secured and

<P>brought round by their aunt, served to strengthen them in

<P>believing they had no faults.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Lady Bertram did not go into public with her daughters.

<P>She was too indolent even to accept a mother's gratification

<P>in witnessing their success and enjoyment at the expense

<P>of any personal trouble, and the charge was made over

<P>to her sister, who desired nothing better than a post

<P>of such honourable representation, and very thoroughly

<P>relished the means it afforded her of mixing in society

<P>without having horses to hire.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny had no share in the festivities of the season;

<P>but she enjoyed being avowedly useful as her aunt's companion

<P>when they called away the rest of the family; and, as Miss

<P>Lee had left Mansfield, she naturally became everything

<P>to Lady Bertram during the night of a ball or a party.

<P>She talked to her, listened to her, read to her;

<P>and the tranquillity of such evenings, her perfect security

<P>in such a _tete-a-tete_ from any sound of unkindness,

<P>was unspeakably welcome to a mind which had seldom

<P>known a pause in its alarms or embarrassments.&nbsp; As to

<P>her cousins' gaieties, she loved to hear an account of them,

<P>especially of the balls, and whom Edmund had danced with;

<P>but thought too lowly of her own situation to imagine

<P>she should ever be admitted to the same, and listened,

<P>therefore, without an idea of any nearer concern in them.

<P>Upon the whole, it was a comfortable winter to her;

<P>for though it brought no William to England, the never-failing

<P>hope of his arrival was worth much.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The ensuing spring deprived her of her valued friend,

<P>the old grey pony; and for some time she was in danger of

<P>feeling the loss in her health as well as in her affections;

<P>for in spite of the acknowledged importance of her riding

<P>on horse-back, no measures were taken for mounting

<P>her again, "because," as it was observed by her aunts,

<P>"she might ride one of her cousin's horses at any time

<P>when they did not want them," and as the Miss Bertrams

<P>regularly wanted their horses every fine day, and had no

<P>idea of carrying their obliging manners to the sacrifice

<P>of any real pleasure, that time, of course, never came.

<P>They took their cheerful rides in the fine mornings

<P>of April and May; and Fanny either sat at home the whole

<P>day with one aunt, or walked beyond her strength at the

<P>instigation of the other:&nbsp; Lady Bertram holding exercise

<P>to be as unnecessary for everybody as it was unpleasant

<P>to herself; and Mrs. Norris, who was walking all day,

<P>thinking everybody ought to walk as much.&nbsp; Edmund was absent

<P>at this time, or the evil would have been earlier remedied.

<P>When he returned, to understand how Fanny was situated,

<P>and perceived its ill effects, there seemed with him but

<P>one thing to be done; and that "Fanny must have a horse"

<P>was the resolute declaration with which he opposed

<P>whatever could be urged by the supineness of his mother,

<P>or the economy of his aunt, to make it appear unimportant.

<P>Mrs. Norris could not help thinking that some steady

<P>old thing might be found among the numbers belonging

<P>to the Park that would do vastly well; or that one might

<P>be borrowed of the steward; or that perhaps Dr. Grant

<P>might now and then lend them the pony he sent to the post.

<P>She could not but consider it as absolutely unnecessary,

<P>and even improper, that Fanny should have a regular

<P>lady's horse of her own, in the style of her cousins.

<P>She was sure Sir Thomas had never intended it:&nbsp; and she

<P>must say that, to be making such a purchase in his absence,

<P>and adding to the great expenses of his stable,

<P>at a time when a large part of his income was unsettled,

<P>seemed to her very unjustifiable.&nbsp; "Fanny must have

<P>a horse," was Edmund's only reply.&nbsp; Mrs. Norris could

<P>not see it in the same light.&nbsp; Lady Bertram did:

<P>she entirely agreed with her son as to the necessity of it,

<P>and as to its being considered necessary by his father;

<P>she only pleaded against there being any hurry; she only

<P>wanted him to wait till Sir Thomas's return, and then Sir

<P>Thomas might settle it all himself.&nbsp; He would be at home

<P>in September, and where would be the harm of only waiting

<P>till September?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Though Edmund was much more displeased with his aunt than

<P>with his mother, as evincing least regard for her niece,

<P>he could not help paying more attention to what she said;

<P>and at length determined on a method of proceeding

<P>which would obviate the risk of his father's thinking he

<P>had done too much, and at the same time procure for Fanny

<P>the immediate means of exercise, which he could not bear

<P>she should be without.&nbsp; He had three horses of his own,

<P>but not one that would carry a woman.&nbsp; Two of them

<P>were hunters; the third, a useful road-horse: this third he

<P>resolved to exchange for one that his cousin might ride;

<P>he knew where such a one was to be met with; and having once

<P>made up his mind, the whole business was soon completed.

<P>The new mare proved a treasure; with a very little

<P>trouble she became exactly calculated for the purpose,

<P>and Fanny was then put in almost full possession of her.

<P>She had not supposed before that anything could ever suit

<P>her like the old grey pony; but her delight in Edmund's

<P>mare was far beyond any former pleasure of the sort;

<P>and the addition it was ever receiving in the consideration

<P>of that kindness from which her pleasure sprung,

<P>was beyond all her words to express.&nbsp; She regarded

<P>her cousin as an example of everything good and great,

<P>as possessing worth which no one but herself could

<P>ever appreciate, and as entitled to such gratitude

<P>from her as no feelings could be strong enough to pay.

<P>Her sentiments towards him were compounded of all that

<P>was respectful, grateful, confiding, and tender.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As the horse continued in name, as well as fact,

<P>the property of Edmund, Mrs. Norris could tolerate its being

<P>for Fanny's use; and had Lady Bertram ever thought about

<P>her own objection again, he might have been excused in her

<P>eyes for not waiting till Sir Thomas's return in September,

<P>for when September came Sir Thomas was still abroad,

<P>and without any near prospect of finishing his business.

<P>Unfavourable circumstances had suddenly arisen at a moment

<P>when he was beginning to turn all his thoughts towards England;

<P>and the very great uncertainty in which everything was then

<P>involved determined him on sending home his son, and waiting

<P>the final arrangement by himself Tom arrived safely,

<P>bringing an excellent account of his father's health;

<P>but to very little purpose, as far as Mrs. Norris

<P>was concerned.&nbsp; Sir Thomas's sending away his son seemed

<P>to her so like a parent's care, under the influence of a

<P>foreboding of evil to himself, that she could not help

<P>feeling dreadful presentiments; and as the long evenings

<P>of autumn came on, was so terribly haunted by these ideas,

<P>in the sad solitariness of her cottage, as to be obliged

<P>to take daily refuge in the dining-room of the Park.

<P>The return of winter engagements, however, was not

<P>without its effect; and in the course of their progress,

<P>her mind became so pleasantly occupied in superintending

<P>the fortunes of her eldest niece, as tolerably to quiet

<P>her nerves.&nbsp; "If poor Sir Thomas were fated never to return,

<P>it would be peculiarly consoling to see their dear Maria

<P>well married," she very often thought; always when they

<P>were in the company of men of fortune, and particularly on

<P>the introduction of a young man who had recently succeeded

<P>to one of the largest estates and finest places in the country.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Rushworth was from the first struck with the beauty

<P>of Miss Bertram, and, being inclined to marry, soon fancied

<P>himself in love.&nbsp; He was a heavy young man, with not more

<P>than common sense; but as there was nothing disagreeable

<P>in his figure or address, the young lady was well pleased

<P>with her conquest.&nbsp; Being now in her twenty-first year,

<P>Maria Bertram was beginning to think matrimony a duty;

<P>and as a marriage with Mr. Rushworth would give her the

<P>enjoyment of a larger income than her father's, as well as

<P>ensure her the house in town, which was now a prime object,

<P>it became, by the same rule of moral obligation,

<P>her evident duty to marry Mr. Rushworth if she could.

<P>Mrs. Norris was most zealous in promoting the match,

<P>by every suggestion and contrivance likely to enhance

<P>its desirableness to either party; and, among other means,

<P>by seeking an intimacy with the gentleman's mother,

<P>who at present lived with him, and to whom she even forced

<P>Lady Bertram to go through ten miles of indifferent road

<P>to pay a morning visit.&nbsp; It was not long before a good

<P>understanding took place between this lady and herself.

<P>Mrs. Rushworth acknowledged herself very desirous that

<P>her son should marry, and declared that of all the young

<P>ladies she had ever seen, Miss Bertram seemed, by her

<P>amiable qualities and accomplishments, the best adapted

<P>to make him happy.&nbsp; Mrs. Norris accepted the compliment,

<P>and admired the nice discernment of character which

<P>could so well distinguish merit.&nbsp; Maria was indeed

<P>the pride and delight of them all--perfectly faultless--

<P>an angel; and, of course, so surrounded by admirers, must be

<P>difficult in her choice:&nbsp; but yet, as far as Mrs. Norris

<P>could allow herself to decide on so short an acquaintance,

<P>Mr. Rushworth appeared precisely the young man to deserve

<P>and attach her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After dancing with each other at a proper number of balls,

<P>the young people justified these opinions, and an engagement,

<P>with a due reference to the absent Sir Thomas, was entered into,

<P>much to the satisfaction of their respective families,

<P>and of the general lookers-on of the neighbourhood,

<P>who had, for many weeks past, felt the expediency

<P>of Mr. Rushworth's marrying Miss Bertram.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was some months before Sir Thomas's consent could

<P>be received; but, in the meanwhile, as no one felt

<P>a doubt of his most cordial pleasure in the connexion,

<P>the intercourse of the two families was carried on

<P>without restraint, and no other attempt made at secrecy

<P>than Mrs. Norris's talking of it everywhere as a matter

<P>not to be talked of at present.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Edmund was the only one of the family who could see a fault

<P>in the business; but no representation of his aunt's could

<P>induce him to find Mr. Rushworth a desirable companion.

<P>He could allow his sister to be the best judge of her

<P>own happiness, but he was not pleased that her happiness

<P>should centre in a large income; nor could he refrain

<P>from often saying to himself, in Mr. Rushworth's company--

<P>"If this man had not twelve thousand a year, he would be

<P>a very stupid fellow."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sir Thomas, however, was truly happy in the prospect of an

<P>alliance so unquestionably advantageous, and of which he

<P>heard nothing but the perfectly good and agreeable.

<P>It was a connexion exactly of the right sort--

<P>in the same county, and the same interest--and his most

<P>hearty concurrence was conveyed as soon as possible.

<P>He only conditioned that the marriage should not take

<P>place before his return, which he was again looking

<P>eagerly forward to.&nbsp; He wrote in April, and had strong

<P>hopes of settling everything to his entire satisfaction,

<P>and leaving Antigua before the end of the summer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Such was the state of affairs in the month of July;

<P>and Fanny had just reached her eighteenth year, when the

<P>society of the village received an addition in the brother

<P>and sister of Mrs. Grant, a Mr. and Miss Crawford,

<P>the children of her mother by a second marriage.

<P>They were young people of fortune.&nbsp; The son had a good

<P>estate in Norfolk, the daughter twenty thousand pounds.

<P>As children, their sister had been always very fond

<P>of them; but, as her own marriage had been soon followed

<P>by the death of their common parent, which left them

<P>to the care of a brother of their father, of whom

<P>Mrs. Grant knew nothing, she had scarcely seen them since.

<P>In their uncle's house they had found a kind home.

<P>Admiral and Mrs. Crawford, though agreeing in nothing else,

<P>were united in affection for these children, or, at least,

<P>were no farther adverse in their feelings than that each

<P>had their favourite, to whom they showed the greatest

<P>fondness of the two.&nbsp; The Admiral delighted in the boy,

<P>Mrs. Crawford doted on the girl; and it was the lady's

<P>death which now obliged her _protegee_, after some months'

<P>further trial at her uncle's house, to find another home.

<P>Admiral Crawford was a man of vicious conduct, who chose,

<P>instead of retaining his niece, to bring his mistress

<P>under his own roof; and to this Mrs. Grant was indebted

<P>for her sister's proposal of coming to her, a measure quite

<P>as welcome on one side as it could be expedient on the other;

<P>for Mrs. Grant, having by this time run through the usual

<P>resources of ladies residing in the country without a

<P>family of children--having more than filled her favourite

<P>sitting-room with pretty furniture, and made a choice

<P>collection of plants and poultry--was very much in want

<P>of some variety at home.&nbsp; The arrival, therefore, of a sister

<P>whom she had always loved, and now hoped to retain with

<P>her as long as she remained single, was highly agreeable;

<P>and her chief anxiety was lest Mansfield should not satisfy

<P>the habits of a young woman who had been mostly used

<P>to London.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Miss Crawford was not entirely free from similar

<P>apprehensions, though they arose principally from doubts

<P>of her sister's style of living and tone of society;

<P>and it was not till after she had tried in vain to persuade

<P>her brother to settle with her at his own country house,

<P>that she could resolve to hazard herself among her

<P>other relations.&nbsp; To anything like a permanence of abode,

<P>or limitation of society, Henry Crawford had, unluckily,

<P>a great dislike:&nbsp; he could not accommodate his sister

<P>in an article of such importance; but he escorted her,

<P>with the utmost kindness, into Northamptonshire,

<P>and as readily engaged to fetch her away again, at half

<P>an hour's notice, whenever she were weary of the place.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The meeting was very satisfactory on each side.

<P>Miss Crawford found a sister without preciseness

<P>or rusticity, a sister's husband who looked the gentleman,

<P>and a house commodious and well fitted up; and Mrs. Grant

<P>received in those whom she hoped to love better than ever

<P>a young man and woman of very prepossessing appearance.

<P>Mary Crawford was remarkably pretty; Henry, though not handsome,

<P>had air and countenance; the manners of both were lively

<P>and pleasant, and Mrs. Grant immediately gave them credit

<P>for everything else.&nbsp; She was delighted with each,

<P>but Mary was her dearest object; and having never been

<P>able to glory in beauty of her own, she thoroughly enjoyed

<P>the power of being proud of her sister's. She had not waited

<P>her arrival to look out for a suitable match for her:

<P>she had fixed on Tom Bertram; the eldest son of a baronet

<P>was not too good for a girl of twenty thousand pounds,

<P>with all the elegance and accomplishments which Mrs. Grant

<P>foresaw in her; and being a warm-hearted, unreserved woman,

<P>Mary had not been three hours in the house before she

<P>told her what she had planned.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Miss Crawford was glad to find a family of such consequence

<P>so very near them, and not at all displeased either at

<P>her sister's early care, or the choice it had fallen on.

<P>Matrimony was her object, provided she could marry well:

<P>and having seen Mr. Bertram in town, she knew that

<P>objection could no more be made to his person than to

<P>his situation in life.&nbsp; While she treated it as a joke,

<P>therefore, she did not forget to think of it seriously.

<P>The scheme was soon repeated to Henry.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And now," added Mrs. Grant, "I have thought of something

<P>to make it complete.&nbsp; I should dearly love to settle you

<P>both in this country; and therefore, Henry, you shall

<P>marry the youngest Miss Bertram, a nice, handsome,

<P>good-humoured, accomplished girl, who will make you very happy."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Henry bowed and thanked her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear sister," said Mary, "if you can persuade him

<P>into anything of the sort, it will be a fresh matter of

<P>delight to me to find myself allied to anybody so clever,

<P>and I shall only regret that you have not half a dozen

<P>daughters to dispose of.&nbsp; If you can persuade Henry

<P>to marry, you must have the address of a Frenchwoman.

<P>All that English abilities can do has been tried already.

<P>I have three very particular friends who have been all

<P>dying for him in their turn; and the pains which they,

<P>their mothers (very clever women), as well as my dear

<P>aunt and myself, have taken to reason, coax, or trick

<P>him into marrying, is inconceivable!&nbsp; He is the most

<P>horrible flirt that can be imagined.&nbsp; If your Miss

<P>Bertrams do not like to have their hearts broke, let them

<P>avoid Henry."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear brother, I will not believe this of you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, I am sure you are too good.&nbsp; You will be kinder than Mary.

<P>You will allow for the doubts of youth and inexperience.

<P>I am of a cautious temper, and unwilling to risk my

<P>happiness in a hurry.&nbsp; Nobody can think more highly of

<P>the matrimonial state than myself I consider the blessing

<P>of a wife as most justly described in those discreet

<P>lines of the poet--'Heaven's _last_ best gift.'"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There, Mrs. Grant, you see how he dwells on one word,

<P>and only look at his smile.&nbsp; I assure you he is very detestable;

<P>the Admiral's lessons have quite spoiled him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I pay very little regard," said Mrs. Grant, "to what

<P>any young person says on the subject of marriage.

<P>If they profess a disinclination for it, I only set it

<P>down that they have not yet seen the right person."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Dr. Grant laughingly congratulated Miss Crawford

<P>on feeling no disinclination to the state herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh yes!&nbsp; I am not at all ashamed of it.&nbsp; I would

<P>have everybody marry if they can do it properly:

<P>I do not like to have people throw themselves away;

<P>but everybody should marry as soon as they can do it

<P>to advantage."
