<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>Henry Crawford was at Mansfield Park again the next morning,

<P>and at an earlier hour than common visiting warrants.

<P>The two ladies were together in the breakfast-room, and,

<P>fortunately for him, Lady Bertram was on the very point

<P>of quitting it as he entered.&nbsp; She was almost at the door,

<P>and not chusing by any means to take so much trouble in vain,

<P>she still went on, after a civil reception, a short sentence

<P>about being waited for, and a "Let Sir Thomas know"

<P>to the servant.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Henry, overjoyed to have her go, bowed and watched her off,

<P>and without losing another moment, turned instantly to Fanny,

<P>and, taking out some letters, said, with a most animated look,

<P>"I must acknowledge myself infinitely obliged to any creature

<P>who gives me such an opportunity of seeing you alone:

<P>I have been wishing it more than you can have any idea.

<P>Knowing as I do what your feelings as a sister are, I could

<P>hardly have borne that any one in the house should share

<P>with you in the first knowledge of the news I now bring.

<P>He is made.&nbsp; Your brother is a lieutenant.&nbsp; I have

<P>the infinite satisfaction of congratulating you on your

<P>brother's promotion.&nbsp; Here are the letters which announce it,

<P>this moment come to hand.&nbsp; You will, perhaps, like to see them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny could not speak, but he did not want her to speak.

<P>To see the expression of her eyes, the change

<P>of her complexion, the progress of her feelings,

<P>their doubt, confusion, and felicity, was enough.

<P>She took the letters as he gave them.&nbsp; The first was

<P>from the Admiral to inform his nephew, in a few words,

<P>of his having succeeded in the object he had undertaken,

<P>the promotion of young Price, and enclosing two more,

<P>one from the Secretary of the First Lord to a friend,

<P>whom the Admiral had set to work in the business,

<P>the other from that friend to himself, by which it

<P>appeared that his lordship had the very great happiness

<P>of attending to the recommendation of Sir Charles;

<P>that Sir Charles was much delighted in having such an

<P>opportunity of proving his regard for Admiral Crawford,

<P>and that the circumstance of Mr. William Price's commission

<P>as Second Lieutenant of H.M. Sloop Thrush being made

<P>out was spreading general joy through a wide circle

<P>of great people.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>While her hand was trembling under these letters,

<P>her eye running from one to the other, and her heart

<P>swelling with emotion, Crawford thus continued,

<P>with unfeigned eagerness, to express his interest in the event--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I will not talk of my own happiness," said he, "great as

<P>it is, for I think only of yours.&nbsp; Compared with you,

<P>who has a right to be happy?&nbsp; I have almost grudged myself

<P>my own prior knowledge of what you ought to have known

<P>before all the world.&nbsp; I have not lost a moment, however.

<P>The post was late this morning, but there has not been

<P>since a moment's delay.&nbsp; How impatient, how anxious,

<P>how wild I have been on the subject, I will not attempt

<P>to describe; how severely mortified, how cruelly disappointed,

<P>in not having it finished while I was in London!

<P>I was kept there from day to day in the hope of it,

<P>for nothing less dear to me than such an object would

<P>have detained me half the time from Mansfield.

<P>But though my uncle entered into my wishes with all the

<P>warmth I could desire, and exerted himself immediately,

<P>there were difficulties from the absence of one friend,

<P>and the engagements of another, which at last I could no longer

<P>bear to stay the end of, and knowing in what good hands I

<P>left the cause, I came away on Monday, trusting that many

<P>posts would not pass before I should be followed by such

<P>very letters as these.&nbsp; My uncle, who is the very best man

<P>in the world, has exerted himself, as I knew he would,

<P>after seeing your brother.&nbsp; He was delighted with him.

<P>I would not allow myself yesterday to say how delighted,

<P>or to repeat half that the Admiral said in his praise.

<P>I deferred it all till his praise should be proved

<P>the praise of a friend, as this day _does_ prove it.

<P>_Now_ I may say that even I could not require William

<P>Price to excite a greater interest, or be followed

<P>by warmer wishes and higher commendation, than were most

<P>voluntarily bestowed by my uncle after the evening they had

<P>passed together."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Has this been all _your_ doing, then?" cried Fanny.

<P>"Good heaven! how very, very kind!&nbsp; Have you really--

<P>was it by _your_ desire?&nbsp; I beg your pardon, but I

<P>am bewildered.&nbsp; Did Admiral Crawford apply?&nbsp; How was it?

<P>I am stupefied."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Henry was most happy to make it more intelligible,

<P>by beginning at an earlier stage, and explaining very

<P>particularly what he had done.&nbsp; His last journey to London

<P>had been undertaken with no other view than that of

<P>introducing her brother in Hill Street, and prevailing

<P>on the Admiral to exert whatever interest he might

<P>have for getting him on.&nbsp; This had been his business.

<P>He had communicated it to no creature:&nbsp; he had not

<P>breathed a syllable of it even to Mary; while uncertain

<P>of the issue, he could not have borne any participation

<P>of his feelings, but this had been his business; and he

<P>spoke with such a glow of what his solicitude had been,

<P>and used such strong expressions, was so abounding

<P>in the _deepest_ _interest_, in _twofold_ _motives_,

<P>in _views_ _and_ _wishes_ _more_ _than_ _could_ _be_ _told_,

<P>that Fanny could not have remained insensible of his drift,

<P>had she been able to attend; but her heart was so full

<P>and her senses still so astonished, that she could listen

<P>but imperfectly even to what he told her of William,

<P>and saying only when he paused, "How kind! how very kind!

<P>Oh, Mr. Crawford, we are infinitely obliged to you!

<P>Dearest, dearest William!"&nbsp; She jumped up and moved in haste

<P>towards the door, crying out, "I will go to my uncle.

<P>My uncle ought to know it as soon as possible."&nbsp; But this

<P>could not be suffered.&nbsp; The opportunity was too fair,

<P>and his feelings too impatient.&nbsp; He was after her immediately.

<P>"She must not go, she must allow him five minutes longer,"

<P>and he took her hand and led her back to her seat,

<P>and was in the middle of his farther explanation,

<P>before she had suspected for what she was detained.

<P>When she did understand it, however, and found herself

<P>expected to believe that she had created sensations which

<P>his heart had never known before, and that everything

<P>he had done for William was to be placed to the account

<P>of his excessive and unequalled attachment to her,

<P>she was exceedingly distressed, and for some moments

<P>unable to speak.&nbsp; She considered it all as nonsense,

<P>as mere trifling and gallantry, which meant only to deceive

<P>for the hour; she could not but feel that it was treating

<P>her improperly and unworthily, and in such a way as she

<P>had not deserved; but it was like himself, and entirely

<P>of a piece with what she had seen before; and she would

<P>not allow herself to shew half the displeasure she felt,

<P>because he had been conferring an obligation, which no

<P>want of delicacy on his part could make a trifle to her.

<P>While her heart was still bounding with joy and gratitude

<P>on William's behalf, she could not be severely resentful

<P>of anything that injured only herself; and after having

<P>twice drawn back her hand, and twice attempted in vain

<P>to turn away from him, she got up, and said only,

<P>with much agitation, "Don't, Mr. Crawford, pray don't! I

<P>beg you would not.&nbsp; This is a sort of talking which is very

<P>unpleasant to me.&nbsp; I must go away.&nbsp; I cannot bear it."

<P>But he was still talking on, describing his affection,

<P>soliciting a return, and, finally, in words so plain

<P>as to bear but one meaning even to her, offering himself,

<P>hand, fortune, everything, to her acceptance.&nbsp; It was so;

<P>he had said it.&nbsp; Her astonishment and confusion increased;

<P>and though still not knowing how to suppose him serious,

<P>she could hardly stand.&nbsp; He pressed for an answer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, no, no!" she cried, hiding her face.&nbsp; "This is all nonsense.

<P>Do not distress me.&nbsp; I can hear no more of this.

<P>Your kindness to William makes me more obliged to you

<P>than words can express; but I do not want, I cannot bear,

<P>I must not listen to such--No, no, don't think of me.

<P>But you are _not_ thinking of me.&nbsp; I know it is all nothing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She had burst away from him, and at that moment Sir Thomas

<P>was heard speaking to a servant in his way towards the room

<P>they were in.&nbsp; It was no time for farther assurances

<P>or entreaty, though to part with her at a moment when her

<P>modesty alone seemed, to his sanguine and preassured mind,

<P>to stand in the way of the happiness he sought, was a

<P>cruel necessity.&nbsp; She rushed out at an opposite door

<P>from the one her uncle was approaching, and was walking

<P>up and down the East room ill the utmost confusion

<P>of contrary feeling, before Sir Thomas's politeness

<P>or apologies were over, or he had reached the beginning

<P>of the joyful intelligence which his visitor came to communicate.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was feeling, thinking, trembling about everything;

<P>agitated, happy, miserable, infinitely obliged,

<P>absolutely angry.&nbsp; It was all beyond belief!

<P>He was inexcusable, incomprehensible!&nbsp; But such were

<P>his habits that he could do nothing without a mixture

<P>of evil.&nbsp; He had previously made her the happiest

<P>of human beings, and now he had insulted--she knew

<P>not what to say, how to class, or how to regard it.

<P>She would not have him be serious, and yet what could

<P>excuse the use of such words and offers, if they meant but to

<P>trifle?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But William was a lieutenant.&nbsp; _That_ was a fact beyond

<P>a doubt, and without an alloy.&nbsp; She would think of it

<P>for ever and forget all the rest.&nbsp; Mr. Crawford would

<P>certainly never address her so again:&nbsp; he must have

<P>seen how unwelcome it was to her; and in that case,

<P>how gratefully she could esteem him for his friendship

<P>to William!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She would not stir farther from the East room than

<P>the head of the great staircase, till she had satisfied

<P>herself of Mr. Crawford's having left the house;

<P>but when convinced of his being gone, she was eager to go

<P>down and be with her uncle, and have all the happiness

<P>of his joy as well as her own, and all the benefit

<P>of his information or his conjectures as to what would

<P>now be William's destination.&nbsp; Sir Thomas was as joyful

<P>as she could desire, and very kind and communicative;

<P>and she had so comfortable a talk with him about William

<P>as to make her feel as if nothing had occurred to vex her,

<P>till she found, towards the close, that Mr. Crawford

<P>was engaged to return and dine there that very day.

<P>This was a most unwelcome hearing, for though he might

<P>think nothing of what had passed, it would be quite

<P>distressing to her to see him again so soon.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She tried to get the better of it; tried very hard,

<P>as the dinner hour approached, to feel and appear as usual;

<P>but it was quite impossible for her not to look most shy

<P>and uncomfortable when their visitor entered the room.

<P>She could not have supposed it in the power of any concurrence

<P>of circumstances to give her so many painful sensations on

<P>the first day of hearing of William's promotion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Crawford was not only in the room--he was soon close

<P>to her.&nbsp; He had a note to deliver from his sister.

<P>Fanny could not look at him, but there was no consciousness

<P>of past folly in his voice.&nbsp; She opened her note immediately,

<P>glad to have anything to do, and happy, as she read it,

<P>to feel that the fidgetings of her aunt Norris, who was

<P>also to dine there, screened her a little from view.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear Fanny,--for so I may now always call you,

<P>to the infinite relief of a tongue that has been stumbling

<P>at _Miss_ _Price_ for at least the last six weeks--

<P>I cannot let my brother go without sending you a few lines

<P>of general congratulation, and giving my most joyful consent

<P>and approval.&nbsp; Go on, my dear Fanny, and without fear;

<P>there can be no difficulties worth naming.&nbsp; I chuse to

<P>suppose that the assurance of my consent will be something;

<P>so you may smile upon him with your sweetest smiles

<P>this afternoon, and send him back to me even happier

<P>than he goes.--Yours affectionately, M. C."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>These were not expressions to do Fanny any good;

<P>for though she read in too much haste and confusion

<P>to form the clearest judgment of Miss Crawford's meaning,

<P>it was evident that she meant to compliment her on her

<P>brother's attachment, and even to _appear_ to believe

<P>it serious.&nbsp; She did not know what to do, or what to think.

<P>There was wretchedness in the idea of its being serious;

<P>there was perplexity and agitation every way.

<P>She was distressed whenever Mr. Crawford spoke to her,

<P>and he spoke to her much too often; and she was afraid

<P>there was a something in his voice and manner in addressing

<P>her very different from what they were when he talked

<P>to the others.&nbsp; Her comfort in that day's dinner

<P>was quite destroyed:&nbsp; she could hardly eat anything;

<P>and when Sir Thomas good-humouredly observed that joy had

<P>taken away her appetite, she was ready to sink with shame,

<P>from the dread of Mr. Crawford's interpretation;

<P>for though nothing could have tempted her to turn her eyes

<P>to the right hand, where he sat, she felt that _his_

<P>were immediately directed towards her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was more silent than ever.&nbsp; She would hardly join

<P>even when William was the subject, for his commission

<P>came all from the right hand too, and there was pain

<P>in the connexion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She thought Lady Bertram sat longer than ever, and began

<P>to be in despair of ever getting away; but at last they

<P>were in the drawing-room, and she was able to think

<P>as she would, while her aunts finished the subject

<P>of William's appointment in their own style.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Norris seemed as much delighted with the saving

<P>it would be to Sir Thomas as with any part of it.

<P>"_Now_ William would be able to keep himself, which would

<P>make a vast difference to his uncle, for it was unknown

<P>how much he had cost his uncle; and, indeed, it would make

<P>some difference in _her_ presents too.&nbsp; She was very glad

<P>that she had given William what she did at parting,

<P>very glad, indeed, that it had been in her power,

<P>without material inconvenience, just at that time to give

<P>him something rather considerable; that is, for_her_,

<P>with _her_ limited means, for now it would all be useful

<P>in helping to fit up his cabin.&nbsp; She knew he must be at

<P>some expense, that he would have many things to buy,

<P>though to be sure his father and mother would be able

<P>to put him in the way of getting everything very cheap;

<P>but she was very glad she had contributed her mite

<P>towards it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am glad you gave him something considerable,"

<P>said Lady Bertram, with most unsuspicious calmness,

<P>"for _I_ gave him only 10."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Indeed!" cried Mrs. Norris, reddening.&nbsp; "Upon my word,

<P>he must have gone off with his pockets 1 well lined,

<P>and at no expense for his journey to London either!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Sir Thomas told me 10 would be enough."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Norris, being not at all inclined to question

<P>its sufficiency, began to take the matter in another point.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is amazing," said she, "how much young people cost

<P>their friends, what with bringing them up and putting them

<P>out in the world!&nbsp; They little think how much it comes to,

<P>or what their parents, or their uncles and aunts, pay for

<P>them in the course of the year.&nbsp; Now, here are my sister

<P>Price's children; take them all together, I dare say nobody

<P>would believe what a sum they cost Sir Thomas every year,

<P>to say nothing of what _I_ do for them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very true, sister, as you say.&nbsp; But, poor things!

<P>they cannot help it; and you know it makes very little

<P>difference to Sir Thomas.&nbsp; Fanny, William must not forget

<P>my shawl if he goes to the East Indies; and I shall give

<P>him a commission for anything else that is worth having.

<P>I wish he may go to the East Indies, that I may have my shawl.

<P>I think I will have two shawls, Fanny."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny, meanwhile, speaking only when she could not help it,

<P>was very earnestly trying to understand what Mr. and Miss

<P>Crawford were at.&nbsp; There was everything in the world

<P>_against_ their being serious but his words and manner.

<P>Everything natural, probable, reasonable, was against it;

<P>all their habits and ways of thinking, and all

<P>her own demerits.&nbsp; How could _she_ have excited

<P>serious attachment in a man who had seen so many,

<P>and been admired by so many, and flirted with so many,

<P>infinitely her superiors; who seemed so little open

<P>to serious impressions, even where pains had been taken

<P>to please him; who thought so slightly, so carelessly,

<P>so unfeelingly on all such points; who was everything

<P>to everybody, and seemed to find no one essential to him?

<P>And farther, how could it be supposed that his sister,

<P>with all her high and worldly notions of matrimony,

<P>would be forwarding anything of a serious nature in such

<P>a quarter?&nbsp; Nothing could be more unnatural in either.

<P>Fanny was ashamed of her own doubts.&nbsp; Everything might

<P>be possible rather than serious attachment, or serious

<P>approbation of it toward her.&nbsp; She had quite convinced herself

<P>of this before Sir Thomas and Mr. Crawford joined them.

<P>The difficulty was in maintaining the conviction quite

<P>so absolutely after Mr. Crawford was in the room;

<P>for once or twice a look seemed forced on her which she

<P>did not know how to class among the common meaning;

<P>in any other man, at least, she would have said

<P>that it meant something very earnest, very pointed.

<P>But she still tried to believe it no more than what he

<P>might often have expressed towards her cousins and fifty

<P>other women.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She thought he was wishing to speak to her unheard

<P>by the rest.&nbsp; She fancied he was trying for it the

<P>whole evening at intervals, whenever Sir Thomas was

<P>out of the room, or at all engaged with Mrs. Norris,

<P>and she carefully refused him every opportunity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At last--it seemed an at last to Fanny's nervousness,

<P>though not remarkably late--he began to talk of going away;

<P>but the comfort of the sound was impaired by his turning

<P>to her the next moment, and saying, "Have you nothing to send

<P>to Mary?&nbsp; No answer to her note?&nbsp; She will be disappointed

<P>if she receives nothing from you.&nbsp; Pray write to her,

<P>if it be only a line."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh yes! certainly," cried Fanny, rising in haste,

<P>the haste of embarrassment and of wanting to get away--

<P>"I will write directly."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She went accordingly to the table, where she was in the

<P>habit of writing for her aunt, and prepared her materials

<P>without knowing what in the world to say.&nbsp; She had read

<P>Miss Crawford's note only once, and how to reply to

<P>anything so imperfectly understood was most distressing.

<P>Quite unpractised in such sort of note-writing, had

<P>there been time for scruples and fears as to style she

<P>would have felt them in abundance:&nbsp; but something must

<P>be instantly written; and with only one decided feeling,

<P>that of wishing not to appear to think anything really intended,

<P>she wrote thus, in great trembling both of spirits and hand--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am very much obliged to you, my dear Miss Crawford,

<P>for your kind congratulations, as far as they relate to my

<P>dearest William.&nbsp; The rest of your note I know means nothing;

<P>but I am so unequal to anything of the sort, that I hope

<P>you will excuse my begging you to take no farther notice.

<P>I have seen too much of Mr. Crawford not to understand

<P>his manners; if he understood me as well, he would,

<P>I dare say, behave differently.&nbsp; I do not know what I write,

<P>but it would be a great favour of you never to mention

<P>the subject again.&nbsp; With thanks for the honour of your note,

<P>I remain, dear Miss Crawford, etc., etc."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The conclusion was scarcely intelligible from increasing

<P>fright, for she found that Mr. Crawford, under pretence

<P>of receiving the note, was coming towards her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You cannot think I mean to hurry you," said he,

<P>in an undervoice, perceiving the amazing trepidation

<P>with which she made up the note, "you cannot think

<P>I have any such object.&nbsp; Do not hurry yourself, I entreat."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh!&nbsp; I thank you; I have quite done, just done; it will

<P>be ready in a moment; I am very much obliged to you;

<P>if you will be so good as to give _that_ to Miss Crawford."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The note was held out, and must be taken; and as she

<P>instantly and with averted eyes walked towards the fireplace,

<P>where sat the others, he had nothing to do but to go

<P>in good earnest.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny thought she had never known a day of greater agitation,

<P>both of pain and pleasure; but happily the pleasure

<P>was not of a sort to die with the day; for every day

<P>would restore the knowledge of William's advancement,

<P>whereas the pain, she hoped, would return no more.

<P>She had no doubt that her note must appear excessively

<P>ill-written, that the language would disgrace a child,

<P>for her distress had allowed no arrangement; but at least
