<P>Fanny seemed nearer being right than Edmund had supposed.

<P>The business of finding a play that would suit everybody

<P>proved to be no trifle; and the carpenter had received

<P>his orders and taken his measurements, had suggested

<P>and removed at least two sets of difficulties, and having

<P>made the necessity of an enlargement of plan and expense

<P>fully evident, was already at work, while a play was

<P>still to seek.&nbsp; Other preparations were also in hand.

<P>An enormous roll of green baize had arrived from Northampton,

<P>and been cut out by Mrs. Norris (with a saving by her

<P>good management of full three-quarters of a yard), and

<P>was actually forming into a curtain by the housemaids,

<P>and still the play was wanting; and as two or three days

<P>passed away in this manner, Edmund began almost to hope

<P>that none might ever be found.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There were, in fact, so many things to be attended to,

<P>so many people to be pleased, so many best characters

<P>required, and, above all, such a need that the play

<P>should be at once both tragedy and comedy, that there

<P>did seem as little chance of a decision as anything

<P>pursued by youth and zeal could hold out.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>On the tragic side were the Miss Bertrams, Henry Crawford,

<P>and Mr. Yates; on the comic, Tom Bertram, not _quite_ alone,

<P>because it was evident that Mary Crawford's wishes,

<P>though politely kept back, inclined the same way:&nbsp; but his

<P>determinateness and his power seemed to make allies unnecessary;

<P>and, independent of this great irreconcilable difference,

<P>they wanted a piece containing very few characters

<P>in the whole, but every character first-rate, and three

<P>principal women.&nbsp; All the best plays were run over in vain.

<P>Neither Hamlet, nor Macbeth, nor Othello, nor Douglas,

<P>nor The Gamester, presented anything that could satisfy

<P>even the tragedians; and The Rivals, The School for Scandal,

<P>Wheel of Fortune, Heir at Law, and a long et cetera,

<P>were successively dismissed with yet warmer objections.

<P>No piece could be proposed that did not supply somebody

<P>with a difficulty, and on one side or the other it was

<P>a continual repetition of, "Oh no, _that_ will never do!

<P>Let us have no ranting tragedies.&nbsp; Too many characters.

<P>Not a tolerable woman's part in the play.&nbsp; Anything but _that_,

<P>my dear Tom.&nbsp; It would be impossible to fill it up.

<P>One could not expect anybody to take such a part.

<P>Nothing but buffoonery from beginning to end.

<P>_That_ might do, perhaps, but for the low parts.&nbsp; If I

<P>_must_ give my opinion, I have always thought it the most

<P>insipid play in the English language.&nbsp; _I_ do not wish

<P>to make objections; I shall be happy to be of any use, but I

<P>think we could not chuse worse."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny looked on and listened, not unamused to observe

<P>the selfishness which, more or less disguised, seemed to

<P>govern them all, and wondering how it would end.&nbsp; For her

<P>own gratification she could have wished that something

<P>might be acted, for she had never seen even half a play,

<P>but everything of higher consequence was against it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This will never do," said Tom Bertram at last.&nbsp; "We are

<P>wasting time most abominably.&nbsp; Something must be fixed on.

<P>No matter what, so that something is chosen.&nbsp; We must not be

<P>so nice.&nbsp; A few characters too many must not frighten us.

<P>We must _double_ them.&nbsp; We must descend a little.

<P>If a part is insignificant, the greater our credit in making

<P>anything of it.&nbsp; From this moment I make no difficulties.

<P>I take any part you chuse to give me, so as it be comic.

<P>Let it but be comic, I condition for nothing more."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For about the fifth time he then proposed the Heir at Law,

<P>doubting only whether to prefer Lord Duberley or Dr. Pangloss

<P>for himself; and very earnestly, but very unsuccessfully,

<P>trying to persuade the others that there were some fine

<P>tragic parts in the rest of the dramatis personae.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The pause which followed this fruitless effort

<P>was ended by the same speaker, who, taking up one

<P>of the many volumes of plays that lay on the table,

<P>and turning it over, suddenly exclaimed--"Lovers' Vows!

<P>And why should not Lovers' Vows do for _us_ as well

<P>as for the Ravenshaws?&nbsp; How came it never to be thought

<P>of before?&nbsp; It strikes me as if it would do exactly.

<P>What say you all?&nbsp; Here are two capital tragic parts for

<P>Yates and Crawford, and here is the rhyming Butler for me,

<P>if nobody else wants it; a trifling part, but the sort

<P>of thing I should not dislike, and, as I said before,

<P>I am determined to take anything and do my best.

<P>And as for the rest, they may be filled up by anybody.

<P>It is only Count Cassel and Anhalt."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The suggestion was generally welcome.&nbsp; Everybody was growing

<P>weary of indecision, and the first idea with everybody was,

<P>that nothing had been proposed before so likely to suit

<P>them all.&nbsp; Mr. Yates was particularly pleased:&nbsp; he had

<P>been sighing and longing to do the Baron at Ecclesford,

<P>had grudged every rant of Lord Ravenshaw's, and been forced

<P>to re-rant it all in his own room.&nbsp; The storm through Baron

<P>Wildenheim was the height of his theatrical ambition;

<P>and with the advantage of knowing half the scenes by

<P>heart already, he did now, with the greatest alacrity,

<P>offer his services for the part.&nbsp; To do him justice,

<P>however, he did not resolve to appropriate it;

<P>for remembering that there was some very good ranting-ground

<P>in Frederick, he professed an equal willingness for that.

<P>Henry Crawford was ready to take either.&nbsp; Whichever Mr. Yates

<P>did not chuse would perfectly satisfy him, and a short

<P>parley of compliment ensued.&nbsp; Miss Bertram, feeling all

<P>the interest of an Agatha in the question, took on her

<P>to decide it, by observing to Mr. Yates that this was a

<P>point in which height and figure ought to be considered,

<P>and that _his_ being the tallest, seemed to fit him

<P>peculiarly for the Baron.&nbsp; She was acknowledged to be

<P>quite right, and the two parts being accepted accordingly,

<P>she was certain of the proper Frederick.&nbsp; Three of the

<P>characters were now cast, besides Mr. Rushworth, who was

<P>always answered for by Maria as willing to do anything;

<P>when Julia, meaning, like her sister, to be Agatha,

<P>began to be scrupulous on Miss Crawford's account.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This is not behaving well by the absent," said she.

<P>"Here are not women enough.&nbsp; Amelia and Agatha may do

<P>for Maria and me, but here is nothing for your sister,

<P>Mr. Crawford."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Crawford desired _that_ might not be thought of:

<P>he was very sure his sister had no wish of acting

<P>but as she might be useful, and that she would not

<P>allow herself to be considered in the present case.

<P>But this was immediately opposed by Tom Bertram,

<P>who asserted the part of Amelia to be in every respect

<P>the property of Miss Crawford, if she would accept it.

<P>"It falls as naturally, as necessarily to her," said he,

<P>"as Agatha does to one or other of my sisters.&nbsp; It can be no

<P>sacrifice on their side, for it is highly comic."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A short silence followed.&nbsp; Each sister looked anxious;

<P>for each felt the best claim to Agatha, and was hoping

<P>to have it pressed on her by the rest.&nbsp; Henry Crawford,

<P>who meanwhile had taken up the play, and with seeming

<P>carelessness was turning over the first act, soon settled

<P>the business.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I must entreat Miss _Julia_ Bertram," said he, "not to

<P>engage in the part of Agatha, or it will be the ruin

<P>of all my solemnity.&nbsp; You must not, indeed you must not"

<P>(turning to her). "I could not stand your countenance

<P>dressed up in woe and paleness.&nbsp; The many laughs we have

<P>had together would infallibly come across me, and Frederick

<P>and his knapsack would be obliged to run away."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Pleasantly, courteously, it was spoken; but the

<P>manner was lost in the matter to Julia's feelings.

<P>She saw a glance at Maria which confirmed the injury

<P>to herself:&nbsp; it was a scheme, a trick; she was slighted,

<P>Maria was preferred; the smile of triumph which Maria

<P>was trying to suppress shewed how well it was understood;

<P>and before Julia could command herself enough to speak,

<P>her brother gave his weight against her too, by saying,

<P>"Oh yes!&nbsp; Maria must be Agatha.&nbsp; Maria will be the

<P>best Agatha.&nbsp; Though Julia fancies she prefers tragedy,

<P>I would not trust her in it.&nbsp; There is nothing of tragedy

<P>about her.&nbsp; She has not the look of it.&nbsp; Her features

<P>are not tragic features, and she walks too quick,

<P>and speaks too quick, and would not keep her countenance.

<P>She had better do the old countrywoman:&nbsp; the Cottager's wife;

<P>you had, indeed, Julia.&nbsp; Cottager's wife is a very pretty part,

<P>I assure you.&nbsp; The old lady relieves the high-flown

<P>benevolence of her husband with a good deal of spirit.

<P>You shall be Cottager's wife."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Cottager's wife!" cried Mr. Yates.&nbsp; "What are you

<P>talking of?&nbsp; The most trivial, paltry, insignificant part;

<P>the merest commonplace; not a tolerable speech in the whole.

<P>Your sister do that!&nbsp; It is an insult to propose it.

<P>At Ecclesford the governess was to have done it.

<P>We all agreed that it could not be offered to anybody else.

<P>A little more justice, Mr. Manager, if you please.

<P>You do not deserve the office, if you cannot appreciate

<P>the talents of your company a little better."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why, as to _that_, my good friend, till I and my company

<P>have really acted there must be some guesswork; but I mean

<P>no disparagement to Julia.&nbsp; We cannot have two Agathas,

<P>and we must have one Cottager's wife; and I am sure I set

<P>her the example of moderation myself in being satisfied

<P>with the old Butler.&nbsp; If the part is trifling she will

<P>have more credit in making something of it; and if she

<P>is so desperately bent against everything humorous,

<P>let her take Cottager's speeches instead of Cottager's

<P>wife's, and so change the parts all through; _he_ is

<P>solemn and pathetic enough, I am sure.&nbsp; It could make

<P>no difference in the play, and as for Cottager himself,

<P>when he has got his wife's speeches, _I_ would undertake

<P>him with all my heart."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"With all your partiality for Cottager's wife,"

<P>said Henry Crawford, "it will be impossible to make

<P>anything of it fit for your sister, and we must not suffer

<P>her good-nature to be imposed on.&nbsp; We must not _allow_

<P>her to accept the part.&nbsp; She must not be left to her

<P>own complaisance.&nbsp; Her talents will be wanted in Amelia.

<P>Amelia is a character more difficult to be well represented

<P>than even Agatha.&nbsp; I consider Amelia is the most difficult

<P>character in the whole piece.&nbsp; It requires great powers,

<P>great nicety, to give her playfulness and simplicity

<P>without extravagance.&nbsp; I have seen good actresses fail

<P>in the part.&nbsp; Simplicity, indeed, is beyond the reach

<P>of almost every actress by profession.&nbsp; It requires

<P>a delicacy of feeling which they have not.&nbsp; It requires

<P>a gentlewoman--a Julia Bertram.&nbsp; You _will_ undertake it,

<P>I hope?" turning to her with a look of anxious entreaty,

<P>which softened her a little; but while she hesitated

<P>what to say, her brother again interposed with Miss

<P>Crawford's better claim.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, no, Julia must not be Amelia.&nbsp; It is not at

<P>all the part for her.&nbsp; She would not like it.

<P>She would not do well.&nbsp; She is too tall and robust.

<P>Amelia should be a small, light, girlish, skipping figure.

<P>It is fit for Miss Crawford, and Miss Crawford only.

<P>She looks the part, and I am persuaded will do it admirably."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Without attending to this, Henry Crawford continued

<P>his supplication.&nbsp; "You must oblige us," said he,

<P>"indeed you must.&nbsp; When you have studied the character, I am

<P>sure you will feel it suit you.&nbsp; Tragedy may be your choice,

<P>but it will certainly appear that comedy chuses _you_.

<P>You will be to visit me in prison with a basket of provisions;

<P>you will not refuse to visit me in prison?&nbsp; I think I

<P>see you coming in with your basket"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The influence of his voice was felt.&nbsp; Julia wavered;

<P>but was he only trying to soothe and pacify her, and make

<P>her overlook the previous affront?&nbsp; She distrusted him.

<P>The slight had been most determined.&nbsp; He was, perhaps,

<P>but at treacherous play with her.&nbsp; She looked suspiciously

<P>at her sister; Maria's countenance was to decide it:

<P>if she were vexed and alarmed--but Maria looked all

<P>serenity and satisfaction, and Julia well knew that on

<P>this ground Maria could not be happy but at her expense.

<P>With hasty indignation, therefore, and a tremulous voice,

<P>she said to him, "You do not seem afraid of not

<P>keeping your countenance when I come in with a basket

<P>of provisions--though one might have supposed--but it

<P>is only as Agatha that I was to be so overpowering!"

<P>She stopped--Henry Crawford looked rather foolish,

<P>and as if he did not know what to say.&nbsp; Tom Bertram

<P>began again--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Miss Crawford must be Amelia.&nbsp; She will be an excellent Amelia."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do not be afraid of _my_ wanting the character,"

<P>cried Julia, with angry quickness:&nbsp; "I am _not_ to be Agatha,

<P>and I am sure I will do nothing else; and as to Amelia,

<P>it is of all parts in the world the most disgusting to me.

<P>I quite detest her.&nbsp; An odious, little, pert, unnatural,

<P>impudent girl.&nbsp; I have always protested against comedy,

<P>and this is comedy in its worst form."&nbsp; And so saying,

<P>she walked hastily out of the room, leaving awkward feelings

<P>to more than one, but exciting small compassion in any

<P>except Fanny, who had been a quiet auditor of the whole,

<P>and who could not think of her as under the agitations of

<P>_jealousy_ without great pity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A short silence succeeded her leaving them; but her brother

<P>soon returned to business and Lovers' Vows, and was

<P>eagerly looking over the play, with Mr. Yates's help,

<P>to ascertain what scenery would be necessary--while Maria

<P>and Henry Crawford conversed together in an under-voice,

<P>and the declaration with which she began of, "I am

<P>sure I would give up the part to Julia most willingly,

<P>but that though I shall probably do it very ill,

<P>I feel persuaded _she_ would do it worse," was doubtless

<P>receiving all the compliments it called for.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When this had lasted some time, the division of the party

<P>was completed by Tom Bertram and Mr. Yates walking off

<P>together to consult farther in the room now beginning

<P>to be called _the_ _Theatre_, and Miss Bertram's resolving

<P>to go down to the Parsonage herself with the offer

<P>of Amelia to Miss Crawford; and Fanny remained alone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The first use she made of her solitude was to take up

<P>the volume which had been left on the table, and begin

<P>to acquaint herself with the play of which she had heard

<P>so much.&nbsp; Her curiosity was all awake, and she ran

<P>through it with an eagerness which was suspended only

<P>by intervals of astonishment, that it could be chosen

<P>in the present instance, that it could be proposed

<P>and accepted in a private theatre!&nbsp; Agatha and Amelia

<P>appeared to her in their different ways so totally

<P>improper for home representation--the situation of one,

<P>and the language of the other, so unfit to be expressed

<P>by any woman of modesty, that she could hardly suppose

<P>her cousins could be aware of what they were engaging in;

<P>and longed to have them roused as soon as possible

<P>by the remonstrance which Edmund would certainly make.
