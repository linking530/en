<P>Sir Thomas's return made a striking change in the ways of

<P>the family, independent of Lovers' Vows.&nbsp; Under his government,

<P>Mansfield was an altered place.&nbsp; Some members of their

<P>society sent away, and the spirits of many others saddened--

<P>it was all sameness and gloom compared with the past--

<P>a sombre family party rarely enlivened.&nbsp; There was little

<P>intercourse with the Parsonage.&nbsp; Sir Thomas, drawing back

<P>from intimacies in general, was particularly disinclined,

<P>at this time, for any engagements but in one quarter.

<P>The Rushworths were the only addition to his own domestic

<P>circle which he could solicit.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Edmund did not wonder that such should be his father's feelings,

<P>nor could he regret anything but the exclusion of the Grants.

<P>"But they," he observed to Fanny, "have a claim.&nbsp; They seem

<P>to belong to us; they seem to be part of ourselves.

<P>I could wish my father were more sensible of their very

<P>great attention to my mother and sisters while he was away.

<P>I am afraid they may feel themselves neglected.

<P>But the truth is, that my father hardly knows them.

<P>They had not been here a twelvemonth when he left England.

<P>If he knew them better, he would value their society

<P>as it deserves; for they are in fact exactly the sort

<P>of people he would like.&nbsp; We are sometimes a little

<P>in want of animation among ourselves:&nbsp; my sisters seem

<P>out of spirits, and Tom is certainly not at his ease.

<P>Dr. and Mrs. Grant would enliven us, and make our evenings

<P>pass away with more enjoyment even to my father."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do you think so?" said Fanny:&nbsp; "in my opinion,

<P>my uncle would not like _any_ addition.&nbsp; I think he

<P>values the very quietness you speak of, and that the

<P>repose of his own family circle is all he wants.

<P>And it does not appear to me that we are more serious

<P>than we used to be--I mean before my uncle went abroad.

<P>As well as I can recollect, it was always much the same.

<P>There was never much laughing in his presence; or,

<P>if there is any difference, it is not more, I think,

<P>than such an absence has a tendency to produce at first.

<P>There must be a sort of shyness; but I cannot recollect

<P>that our evenings formerly were ever merry, except when

<P>my uncle was in town.&nbsp; No young people's are, I suppose,

<P>when those they look up to are at home".
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I believe you are right, Fanny," was his reply, after a

<P>short consideration.&nbsp; "I believe our evenings are rather

<P>returned to what they were, than assuming a new character.

<P>The novelty was in their being lively.&nbsp; Yet, how strong

<P>the impression that only a few weeks will give!

<P>I have been feeling as if we had never lived so before."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I suppose I am graver than other people," said Fanny.

<P>"The evenings do not appear long to me.&nbsp; I love to hear

<P>my uncle talk of the West Indies.&nbsp; I could listen to him

<P>for an hour together.&nbsp; It entertains _me_ more than many

<P>other things have done; but then I am unlike other people,

<P>I dare say."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why should you dare say _that_?" (smiling). "Do you

<P>want to be told that you are only unlike other people

<P>in being more wise and discreet?&nbsp; But when did you,

<P>or anybody, ever get a compliment from me, Fanny?

<P>Go to my father if you want to be complimented.

<P>He will satisfy you.&nbsp; Ask your uncle what he thinks,

<P>and you will hear compliments enough:&nbsp; and though they

<P>may be chiefly on your person, you must put up with it,

<P>and trust to his seeing as much beauty of mind in time."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Such language was so new to Fanny that it quite embarrassed her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Your uncle thinks you very pretty, dear Fanny--

<P>and that is the long and the short of the matter.

<P>Anybody but myself would have made something more of it,

<P>and anybody but you would resent that you had not been

<P>thought very pretty before; but the truth is, that your

<P>uncle never did admire you till now--and now he does.

<P>Your complexion is so improved!--and you have gained

<P>so much countenance!--and your figure--nay, Fanny, do not

<P>turn away about it--it is but an uncle.&nbsp; If you cannot

<P>bear an uncle's admiration, what is to become of you?

<P>You must really begin to harden yourself to the idea of

<P>being worth looking at.&nbsp; You must try not to mind growing

<P>up into a pretty woman."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! don't talk so, don't talk so," cried Fanny,

<P>distressed by more feelings than he was aware of; but seeing

<P>that she was distressed, he had done with the subject,

<P>and only added more seriously--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Your uncle is disposed to be pleased with you in

<P>every respect; and I only wish you would talk to him more.

<P>You are one of those who are too silent in the evening circle."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But I do talk to him more than I used.&nbsp; I am sure I do.

<P>Did not you hear me ask him about the slave-trade

<P>last night?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I did--and was in hopes the question would be followed

<P>up by others.&nbsp; It would have pleased your uncle to be

<P>inquired of farther."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And I longed to do it--but there was such a dead silence!

<P>And while my cousins were sitting by without speaking a word,

<P>or seeming at all interested in the subject, I did not like--

<P>I thought it would appear as if I wanted to set myself

<P>off at their expense, by shewing a curiosity and pleasure

<P>in his information which he must wish his own daughters

<P>to feel."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Miss Crawford was very right in what she said of you

<P>the other day:&nbsp; that you seemed almost as fearful of notice

<P>and praise as other women were of neglect.&nbsp; We were talking

<P>of you at the Parsonage, and those were her words.

<P>She has great discernment.&nbsp; I know nobody who distinguishes

<P>characters better.&nbsp; For so young a woman it is remarkable!

<P>She certainly understands _you_ better than you are

<P>understood by the greater part of those who have known you

<P>so long; and with regard to some others, I can perceive,

<P>from occasional lively hints, the unguarded expressions

<P>of the moment, that she could define _many_ as accurately,

<P>did not delicacy forbid it.&nbsp; I wonder what she thinks

<P>of my father!&nbsp; She must admire him as a fine-looking man,

<P>with most gentlemanlike, dignified, consistent manners;

<P>but perhaps, having seen him so seldom, his reserve

<P>may be a little repulsive.&nbsp; Could they be much together,

<P>I feel sure of their liking each other.&nbsp; He would enjoy

<P>her liveliness and she has talents to value his powers.

<P>I wish they met more frequently!&nbsp; I hope she does not suppose

<P>there is any dislike on his side."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She must know herself too secure of the regard of all

<P>the rest of you," said Fanny, with half a sigh, "to have

<P>any such apprehension.&nbsp; And Sir Thomas's wishing just at

<P>first to be only with his family, is so very natural,

<P>that she can argue nothing from that.&nbsp; After a little while,

<P>I dare say, we shall be meeting again in the same sort

<P>of way, allowing for the difference of the time of year."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This is the first October that she has passed in the country

<P>since her infancy.&nbsp; I do not call Tunbridge or Cheltenham

<P>the country; and November is a still more serious month,

<P>and I can see that Mrs. Grant is very anxious for her

<P>not finding Mansfield dull as winter comes on."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny could have said a great deal, but it was safer to

<P>say nothing, and leave untouched all Miss Crawford's resources--

<P>her accomplishments, her spirits, her importance,

<P>her friends, lest it should betray her into any observations

<P>seemingly unhandsome.&nbsp; Miss Crawford's kind opinion

<P>of herself deserved at least a grateful forbearance,

<P>and she began to talk of something else.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"To-morrow, I think, my uncle dines at Sotherton, and you

<P>and Mr. Bertram too.&nbsp; We shall be quite a small party at home.

<P>I hope my uncle may continue to like Mr. Rushworth."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That is impossible, Fanny.&nbsp; He must like him less

<P>after to-morrow's visit, for we shall be five hours

<P>in his company.&nbsp; I should dread the stupidity of the day,

<P>if there were not a much greater evil to follow--

<P>the impression it must leave on Sir Thomas.&nbsp; He cannot much

<P>longer deceive himself.&nbsp; I am sorry for them all, and would

<P>give something that Rushworth and Maria had never met."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In this quarter, indeed, disappointment was impending

<P>over Sir Thomas.&nbsp; Not all his good-will for Mr. Rushworth,

<P>not all Mr. Rushworth's deference for him, could prevent

<P>him from soon discerning some part of the truth--

<P>that Mr. Rushworth was an inferior young man, as ignorant

<P>in business as in books, with opinions in general unfixed,

<P>and without seeming much aware of it himself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He had expected a very different son-in-law; and beginning

<P>to feel grave on Maria's account, tried to understand

<P>_her_ feelings.&nbsp; Little observation there was necessary

<P>to tell him that indifference was the most favourable

<P>state they could be in.&nbsp; Her behaviour to Mr. Rushworth

<P>was careless and cold.&nbsp; She could not, did not like him.

<P>Sir Thomas resolved to speak seriously to her.

<P>Advantageous as would be the alliance, and long standing

<P>and public as was the engagement, her happiness must not be

<P>sacrificed to it.&nbsp; Mr. Rushworth had, perhaps, been accepted

<P>on too short an acquaintance, and, on knowing him better,

<P>she was repenting.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With solemn kindness Sir Thomas addressed her:&nbsp; told her

<P>his fears, inquired into her wishes, entreated her to be

<P>open and sincere, and assured her that every inconvenience

<P>should be braved, and the connexion entirely given up,

<P>if she felt herself unhappy in the prospect of it.

<P>He would act for her and release her.&nbsp; Maria had a moment's

<P>struggle as she listened, and only a moment's: when her

<P>father ceased, she was able to give her answer immediately,

<P>decidedly, and with no apparent agitation.&nbsp; She thanked

<P>him for his great attention, his paternal kindness, but he

<P>was quite mistaken in supposing she had the smallest desire

<P>of breaking through her engagement, or was sensible of any

<P>change of opinion or inclination since her forming it.

<P>She had the highest esteem for Mr. Rushworth's character

<P>and disposition, and could not have a doubt of her happiness with

<P>him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sir Thomas was satisfied; too glad to be satisfied,

<P>perhaps, to urge the matter quite so far as his judgment

<P>might have dictated to others.&nbsp; It was an alliance which

<P>he could not have relinquished without pain; and thus

<P>he reasoned.&nbsp; Mr. Rushworth was young enough to improve.

<P>Mr. Rushworth must and would improve in good society;

<P>and if Maria could now speak so securely of her happiness

<P>with him, speaking certainly without the prejudice,

<P>the blindness of love, she ought to be believed.

<P>Her feelings, probably, were not acute; he had never

<P>supposed them to be so; but her comforts might not

<P>be less on that account; and if she could dispense

<P>with seeing her husband a leading, shining character,

<P>there would certainly be everything else in her favour.

<P>A well-disposed young woman, who did not marry for love,

<P>was in general but the more attached to her own family;

<P>and the nearness of Sotherton to Mansfield must naturally hold

<P>out the greatest temptation, and would, in all probability,

<P>be a continual supply of the most amiable and innocent enjoyments.

<P>Such and such-like were the reasonings of Sir Thomas,

<P>happy to escape the embarrassing evils of a rupture,

<P>the wonder, the reflections, the reproach that must

<P>attend it; happy to secure a marriage which would bring

<P>him such an addition of respectability and influence,

<P>and very happy to think anything of his daughter's

<P>disposition that was most favourable for the purpose.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To her the conference closed as satisfactorily as to him.

<P>She was in a state of mind to be glad that she had secured

<P>her fate beyond recall:&nbsp; that she had pledged herself

<P>anew to Sotherton; that she was safe from the possibility

<P>of giving Crawford the triumph of governing her actions,

<P>and destroying her prospects; and retired in proud resolve,

<P>determined only to behave more cautiously to Mr. Rushworth

<P>in future, that her father might not be again suspecting her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Had Sir Thomas applied to his daughter within the first

<P>three or four days after Henry Crawford's leaving Mansfield,

<P>before her feelings were at all tranquillised, before she

<P>had given up every hope of him, or absolutely resolved on

<P>enduring his rival, her answer might have been different;

<P>but after another three or four days, when there was no return,

<P>no letter, no message, no symptom of a softened heart,

<P>no hope of advantage from separation, her mind became

<P>cool enough to seek all the comfort that pride and self

<P>revenge could give.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Henry Crawford had destroyed her happiness, but he

<P>should not know that he had done it; he should not

<P>destroy her credit, her appearance, her prosperity, too.

<P>He should not have to think of her as pining in the

<P>retirement of Mansfield for _him_, rejecting Sotherton

<P>and London, independence and splendour, for _his_ sake.

<P>Independence was more needful than ever; the want of it

<P>at Mansfield more sensibly felt.&nbsp; She was less and less

<P>able to endure the restraint which her father imposed.

<P>The liberty which his absence had given was now become

<P>absolutely necessary.&nbsp; She must escape from him and Mansfield

<P>as soon as possible, and find consolation in fortune

<P>and consequence, bustle and the world, for a wounded spirit.

<P>Her mind was quite determined, and varied not.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To such feelings delay, even the delay of much preparation,

<P>would have been an evil, and Mr. Rushworth could hardly

<P>be more impatient for the marriage than herself.

<P>In all the important preparations of the mind she

<P>was complete:&nbsp; being prepared for matrimony by an hatred

<P>of home, restraint, and tranquillity; by the misery

<P>of disappointed affection, and contempt of the man she

<P>was to marry.&nbsp; The rest might wait.&nbsp; The preparations

<P>of new carriages and furniture might wait for London

<P>and spring, when her own taste could have fairer play.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The principals being all agreed in this respect, it soon

<P>appeared that a very few weeks would be sufficient

<P>for such arrangements as must precede the wedding.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Rushworth was quite ready to retire, and make way for

<P>the fortunate young woman whom her dear son had selected;

<P>and very early in November removed herself, her maid,

<P>her footman, and her chariot, with true dowager propriety,

<P>to Bath, there to parade over the wonders of Sotherton

<P>in her evening parties; enjoying them as thoroughly,

<P>perhaps, in the animation of a card-table, as she had

<P>ever done on the spot; and before the middle of the same

<P>month the ceremony had taken place which gave Sotherton

<P>another mistress.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was a very proper wedding.&nbsp; The bride was elegantly dressed;

<P>the two bridesmaids were duly inferior; her father gave

<P>her away; her mother stood with salts in her hand,

<P>expecting to be agitated; her aunt tried to cry;

<P>and the service was impressively read by Dr. Grant.

<P>Nothing could be objected to when it came under the

<P>discussion of the neighbourhood, except that the carriage

<P>which conveyed the bride and bridegroom and Julia

<P>from the church-door to Sotherton was the same chaise

<P>which Mr. Rushworth had used for a twelvemonth before.

<P>In everything else the etiquette of the day might stand

<P>the strictest investigation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was done, and they were gone.&nbsp; Sir Thomas felt as an

<P>anxious father must feel, and was indeed experiencing much

<P>of the agitation which his wife had been apprehensive

<P>of for herself, but had fortunately escaped.&nbsp; Mrs. Norris,

<P>most happy to assist in the duties of the day,

<P>by spending it at the Park to support her sister's spirits,

<P>and drinking the health of Mr. and Mrs. Rushworth in

<P>a supernumerary glass or two, was all joyous delight;

<P>for she had made the match; she had done everything;

<P>and no one would have supposed, from her confident triumph,

<P>that she had ever heard of conjugal infelicity in her life,

<P>or could have the smallest insight into the disposition

<P>of the niece who had been brought up under her eye.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The plan of the young couple was to proceed,

<P>after a few days, to Brighton, and take a house there

<P>for some weeks.&nbsp; Every public place was new to Maria,

<P>and Brighton is almost as gay in winter as in summer.

<P>When the novelty of amusement there was over, it would

<P>be time for the wider range of London.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Julia was to go with them to Brighton.&nbsp; Since rivalry

<P>between the sisters had ceased, they had been gradually

<P>recovering much of their former good understanding;

<P>and were at least sufficiently friends to make each of them

<P>exceedingly glad to be with the other at such a time.

<P>Some other companion than Mr. Rushworth was of the first

<P>consequence to his lady; and Julia was quite as eager

<P>for novelty and pleasure as Maria, though she might not

<P>have struggled through so much to obtain them, and could

<P>better bear a subordinate situation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Their departure made another material change at Mansfield,

<P>a chasm which required some time to fill up.&nbsp; The family

<P>circle became greatly contracted; and though the Miss

<P>Bertrams had latterly added little to its gaiety,

<P>they could not but be missed.&nbsp; Even their mother missed them;

<P>and how much more their tenderhearted cousin, who wandered

<P>about the house, and thought of them, and felt for them,

<P>with a degree of affectionate regret which they had never

<P>done much to deserve!
