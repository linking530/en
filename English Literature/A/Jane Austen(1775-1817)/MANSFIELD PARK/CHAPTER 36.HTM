<P>Edmund now believed himself perfectly acquainted with all

<P>that Fanny could tell, or could leave to be conjectured

<P>of her sentiments, and he was satisfied.&nbsp; It had been,

<P>as he before presumed, too hasty a measure on Crawford's side,

<P>and time must be given to make the idea first familiar,

<P>and then agreeable to her.&nbsp; She must be used to the

<P>consideration of his being in love with her, and then

<P>a return of affection might not be very distant.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He gave this opinion as the result of the conversation

<P>to his father; and recommended there being nothing more said

<P>to her:&nbsp; no farther attempts to influence or persuade;

<P>but that everything should be left to Crawford's assiduities,

<P>and the natural workings of her own mind.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sir Thomas promised that it should be so.&nbsp; Edmund's account

<P>of Fanny's disposition he could believe to be just;

<P>he supposed she had all those feelings, but he must consider

<P>it as very unfortunate that she _had_; for, less willing

<P>than his son to trust to the future, he could not help

<P>fearing that if such very long allowances of time and habit

<P>were necessary for her, she might not have persuaded

<P>herself into receiving his addresses properly before

<P>the young man's inclination for paying them were over.

<P>There was nothing to be done, however, but to submit

<P>quietly and hope the best.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The promised visit from "her friend," as Edmund called

<P>Miss Crawford, was a formidable threat to Fanny,

<P>and she lived in continual terror of it.&nbsp; As a sister,

<P>so partial and so angry, and so little scrupulous of what

<P>she said, and in another light so triumphant and secure,

<P>she was in every way an object of painful alarm.

<P>Her displeasure, her penetration, and her happiness were

<P>all fearful to encounter; and the dependence of having

<P>others present when they met was Fanny's only support

<P>in looking forward to it.&nbsp; She absented herself as little

<P>as possible from Lady Bertram, kept away from the East room,

<P>and took no solitary walk in the shrubbery, in her caution

<P>to avoid any sudden attack.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She succeeded.&nbsp; She was safe in the breakfast-room, with her aunt,

<P>when Miss Crawford did come; and the first misery over,

<P>and Miss Crawford looking and speaking with much less

<P>particularity of expression than she had anticipated,

<P>Fanny began to hope there would be nothing worse

<P>to be endured than a half-hour of moderate agitation.

<P>But here she hoped too much; Miss Crawford was not the slave

<P>of opportunity.&nbsp; She was determined to see Fanny alone,

<P>and therefore said to her tolerably soon, in a low voice,

<P>"I must speak to you for a few minutes somewhere";

<P>words that Fanny felt all over her, in all her pulses

<P>and all her nerves.&nbsp; Denial was impossible.&nbsp; Her habits

<P>of ready submission, on the contrary, made her almost

<P>instantly rise and lead the way out of the room.

<P>She did it with wretched feelings, but it was inevitable.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They were no sooner in the hall than all restraint

<P>of countenance was over on Miss Crawford's side.

<P>She immediately shook her head at Fanny with arch,

<P>yet affectionate reproach, and taking her hand,

<P>seemed hardly able to help beginning directly.

<P>She said nothing, however, but, "Sad, sad girl!

<P>I do not know when I shall have done scolding you,"

<P>and had discretion enough to reserve the rest till they

<P>might be secure of having four walls to themselves.

<P>Fanny naturally turned upstairs, and took her guest to the

<P>apartment which was now always fit for comfortable use;

<P>opening the door, however, with a most aching heart,

<P>and feeling that she had a more distressing scene before

<P>her than ever that spot had yet witnessed.&nbsp; But the evil

<P>ready to burst on her was at least delayed by the sudden

<P>change in Miss Crawford's ideas; by the strong effect

<P>on her mind which the finding herself in the East room

<P>again produced.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ha!" she cried, with instant animation, "am I here again?

<P>The East room!&nbsp; Once only was I in this room before";

<P>and after stopping to look about her, and seemingly

<P>to retrace all that had then passed, she added, "Once

<P>only before.&nbsp; Do you remember it?&nbsp; I came to rehearse.

<P>Your cousin came too; and we had a rehearsal.&nbsp; You were

<P>our audience and prompter.&nbsp; A delightful rehearsal.

<P>I shall never forget it.&nbsp; Here we were, just in this

<P>part of the room:&nbsp; here was your cousin, here was I,

<P>here were the chairs.&nbsp; Oh! why will such things ever

<P>pass away?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Happily for her companion, she wanted no answer.

<P>Her mind was entirely self-engrossed. She was in a reverie

<P>of sweet remembrances.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The scene we were rehearsing was so very remarkable!

<P>The subject of it so very--very--what shall I say?

<P>He was to be describing and recommending matrimony to me.

<P>I think I see him now, trying to be as demure and composed

<P>as Anhalt ought, through the two long speeches.

<P>'When two sympathetic hearts meet in the marriage state,

<P>matrimony may be called a happy life.'&nbsp; I suppose no time

<P>can ever wear out the impression I have of his looks

<P>and voice as he said those words.&nbsp; It was curious,

<P>very curious, that we should have such a scene to play!

<P>If I had the power of recalling any one week of my existence,

<P>it should be that week--that acting week.&nbsp; Say what

<P>you would, Fanny, it should be _that_; for I never knew

<P>such exquisite happiness in any other.&nbsp; His sturdy spirit

<P>to bend as it did!&nbsp; Oh! it was sweet beyond expression.

<P>But alas, that very evening destroyed it all.&nbsp; That very

<P>evening brought your most unwelcome uncle.&nbsp; Poor Sir Thomas,

<P>who was glad to see you?&nbsp; Yet, Fanny, do not imagine I would

<P>now speak disrespectfully of Sir Thomas, though I certainly

<P>did hate him for many a week.&nbsp; No, I do him justice now.

<P>He is just what the head of such a family should be.

<P>Nay, in sober sadness, I believe I now love you all."

<P>And having said so, with a degree of tenderness and

<P>consciousness which Fanny had never seen in her before,

<P>and now thought only too becoming, she turned away

<P>for a moment to recover herself.&nbsp; "I have had a little

<P>fit since I came into this room, as you may perceive,"

<P>said she presently, with a playful smile, "but it is

<P>over now; so let us sit down and be comfortable; for as to

<P>scolding you, Fanny, which I came fully intending to do,

<P>I have not the heart for it when it comes to the point."

<P>And embracing her very affectionately, "Good, gentle Fanny!

<P>when I think of this being the last time of seeing you for I

<P>do not know how long, I feel it quite impossible to do anything

<P>but love you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny was affected.&nbsp; She had not foreseen anything of this,

<P>and her feelings could seldom withstand the melancholy

<P>influence of the word "last."&nbsp; She cried as if she

<P>had loved Miss Crawford more than she possibly could;

<P>and Miss Crawford, yet farther softened by the sight

<P>of such emotion, hung about her with fondness, and said,

<P>"I hate to leave you.&nbsp; I shall see no one half so amiable

<P>where I am going.&nbsp; Who says we shall not be sisters?

<P>I know we shall.&nbsp; I feel that we are born to be connected;

<P>and those tears convince me that you feel it too,

<P>dear Fanny."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny roused herself, and replying only in part, said,

<P>"But you are only going from one set of friends to another.

<P>You are going to a very particular friend."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, very true.&nbsp; Mrs. Fraser has been my intimate friend

<P>for years.&nbsp; But I have not the least inclination to go

<P>near her.&nbsp; I can think only of the friends I am leaving:

<P>my excellent sister, yourself, and the Bertrams in general.

<P>You have all so much more _heart_ among you than one

<P>finds in the world at large.&nbsp; You all give me a feeling

<P>of being able to trust and confide in you, which in common

<P>intercourse one knows nothing of.&nbsp; I wish I had settled

<P>with Mrs. Fraser not to go to her till after Easter, a much

<P>better time for the visit, but now I cannot put her off.

<P>And when I have done with her I must go to her sister,

<P>Lady Stornaway, because _she_ was rather my most particular

<P>friend of the two, but I have not cared much for _her_

<P>these three years."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After this speech the two girls sat many minutes silent,

<P>each thoughtful:&nbsp; Fanny meditating on the different sorts

<P>of friendship in the world, Mary on something of less

<P>philosophic tendency.&nbsp; _She_ first spoke again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How perfectly I remember my resolving to look for

<P>you upstairs, and setting off to find my way to the

<P>East room, without having an idea whereabouts it was!

<P>How well I remember what I was thinking of as I came along,

<P>and my looking in and seeing you here sitting at this

<P>table at work; and then your cousin's astonishment,

<P>when he opened the door, at seeing me here!&nbsp; To be sure,

<P>your uncle's returning that very evening!&nbsp; There never

<P>was anything quite like it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Another short fit of abstraction followed, when,

<P>shaking it off, she thus attacked her companion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why, Fanny, you are absolutely in a reverie.

<P>Thinking, I hope, of one who is always thinking of you.

<P>Oh! that I could transport you for a short time into

<P>our circle in town, that you might understand how your

<P>power over Henry is thought of there!&nbsp; Oh! the envyings

<P>and heartburnings of dozens and dozens; the wonder,

<P>the incredulity that will be felt at hearing what you

<P>have done!&nbsp; For as to secrecy, Henry is quite the hero

<P>of an old romance, and glories in his chains.&nbsp; You should

<P>come to London to know how to estimate your conquest.

<P>If you were to see how he is courted, and how I am courted

<P>for his sake!&nbsp; Now, I am well aware that I shall not be

<P>half so welcome to Mrs. Fraser in consequence of his

<P>situation with you.&nbsp; When she comes to know the truth

<P>she will, very likely, wish me in Northamptonshire again;

<P>for there is a daughter of Mr. Fraser, by a first wife,

<P>whom she is wild to get married, and wants Henry to take.

<P>Oh! she has been trying for him to such a degree.

<P>Innocent and quiet as you sit here, you cannot have an

<P>idea of the _sensation_ that you will be occasioning,

<P>of the curiosity there will be to see you, of the endless

<P>questions I shall have to answer!&nbsp; Poor Margaret Fraser

<P>will be at me for ever about your eyes and your teeth,

<P>and how you do your hair, and who makes your shoes.

<P>I wish Margaret were married, for my poor friend's sake,

<P>for I look upon the Frasers to be about as unhappy as most

<P>other married people.&nbsp; And yet it was a most desirable

<P>match for Janet at the time.&nbsp; We were all delighted.

<P>She could not do otherwise than accept him, for he was rich,

<P>and she had nothing; but he turns out ill-tempered

<P>and _exigeant_, and wants a young woman, a beautiful young

<P>woman of five-and-twenty, to be as steady as himself.

<P>And my friend does not manage him well; she does not seem

<P>to know how to make the best of it.&nbsp; There is a spirit

<P>of irritation which, to say nothing worse, is certainly

<P>very ill-bred. In their house I shall call to mind the

<P>conjugal manners of Mansfield Parsonage with respect.

<P>Even Dr. Grant does shew a thorough confidence in my sister,

<P>and a certain consideration for her judgment, which makes

<P>one feel there _is_ attachment; but of that I shall

<P>see nothing with the Frasers.&nbsp; I shall be at Mansfield

<P>for ever, Fanny.&nbsp; My own sister as a wife, Sir Thomas

<P>Bertram as a husband, are my standards of perfection.

<P>Poor Janet has been sadly taken in, and yet there was

<P>nothing improper on her side:&nbsp; she did not run into the

<P>match inconsiderately; there was no want of foresight.

<P>She took three days to consider of his proposals,

<P>and during those three days asked the advice of everybody

<P>connected with her whose opinion was worth having,

<P>and especially applied to my late dear aunt, whose

<P>knowledge of the world made her judgment very generally

<P>and deservedly looked up to by all the young people

<P>of her acquaintance, and she was decidedly in favour

<P>of Mr. Fraser.&nbsp; This seems as if nothing were a security

<P>for matrimonial comfort.&nbsp; I have not so much to say

<P>for my friend Flora, who jilted a very nice young man

<P>in the Blues for the sake of that horrid Lord Stornaway,

<P>who has about as much sense, Fanny, as Mr. Rushworth,

<P>but much worse-looking, and with a blackguard character.

<P>I _had_ my doubts at the time about her being right,

<P>for he has not even the air of a gentleman, and now I am

<P>sure she was wrong.&nbsp; By the bye, Flora Ross was dying

<P>for Henry the first winter she came out.&nbsp; But were I

<P>to attempt to tell you of all the women whom I have

<P>known to be in love with him, I should never have done.

<P>It is you, only you, insensible Fanny, who can think

<P>of him with anything like indifference.&nbsp; But are you

<P>so insensible as you profess yourself?&nbsp; No, no, I see you

<P>are not."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was, indeed, so deep a blush over Fanny's face

<P>at that moment as might warrant strong suspicion

<P>in a predisposed mind.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Excellent creature!&nbsp; I will not tease you.&nbsp; Everything shall

<P>take its course.&nbsp; But, dear Fanny, you must allow that you

<P>were not so absolutely unprepared to have the question asked

<P>as your cousin fancies.&nbsp; It is not possible but that you

<P>must have had some thoughts on the subject, some surmises

<P>as to what might be.&nbsp; You must have seen that he was

<P>trying to please you by every attention in his power.

<P>Was not he devoted to you at the ball?&nbsp; And then before

<P>the ball, the necklace!&nbsp; Oh! you received it just as it

<P>was meant.&nbsp; You were as conscious as heart could desire.

<P>I remember it perfectly."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do you mean, then, that your brother knew of the

<P>necklace beforehand?&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; Miss Crawford, _that_ was not fair."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Knew of it!&nbsp; It was his own doing entirely, his own thought.

<P>I am ashamed to say that it had never entered my head,

<P>but I was delighted to act on his proposal for both

<P>your sakes."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I will not say," replied Fanny, "that I was not half

<P>afraid at the time of its being so, for there was something

<P>in your look that frightened me, but not at first;

<P>I was as unsuspicious of it at first--indeed, indeed I was.

<P>It is as true as that I sit here.&nbsp; And had I had an idea of it,

<P>nothing should have induced me to accept the necklace.

<P>As to your brother's behaviour, certainly I was sensible of

<P>a particularity:&nbsp; I had been sensible of it some little time,

<P>perhaps two or three weeks; but then I considered it as

<P>meaning nothing:&nbsp; I put it down as simply being his way,

<P>and was as far from supposing as from wishing him to have

<P>any serious thoughts of me.&nbsp; I had not, Miss Crawford,

<P>been an inattentive observer of what was passing between him

<P>and some part of this family in the summer and autumn.

<P>I was quiet, but I was not blind.&nbsp; I could not but see

<P>that Mr. Crawford allowed himself in gallantries which did

<P>mean nothing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah!&nbsp; I cannot deny it.&nbsp; He has now and then been a sad flirt,

<P>and cared very little for the havoc he might be making in

<P>young ladies' affections.&nbsp; I have often scolded him for it,

<P>but it is his only fault; and there is this to be said,

<P>that very few young ladies have any affections worth

<P>caring for.&nbsp; And then, Fanny, the glory of fixing one

<P>who has been shot at by so many; of having it in one's

<P>power to pay off the debts of one's sex!&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; I am sure

<P>it is not in woman's nature to refuse such a triumph."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny shook her head.&nbsp; "I cannot think well of a man

<P>who sports with any woman's feelings; and there may often

<P>be a great deal more suffered than a stander-by can judge of."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not defend him.&nbsp; I leave him entirely to your mercy,

<P>and when he has got you at Everingham, I do not care how much

<P>you lecture him.&nbsp; But this I will say, that his fault,

<P>the liking to make girls a little in love with him, is not

<P>half so dangerous to a wife's happiness as a tendency to fall

<P>in love himself, which he has never been addicted to.

<P>And I do seriously and truly believe that he is attached

<P>to you in a way that he never was to any woman before;

<P>that he loves you with all his heart, and will love you

<P>as nearly for ever as possible.&nbsp; If any man ever loved

<P>a woman for ever, I think Henry will do as much for you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny could not avoid a faint smile, but had nothing

<P>to say.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I cannot imagine Henry ever to have been happier,"

<P>continued Mary presently, "than when he had succeeded

<P>in getting your brother's commission."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She had made a sure push at Fanny's feelings here.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! yes.&nbsp; How very, very kind of him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I know he must have exerted himself very much, for I know

<P>the parties he had to move.&nbsp; The Admiral hates trouble,

<P>and scorns asking favours; and there are so many

<P>young men's claims to be attended to in the same way,

<P>that a friendship and energy, not very determined,

<P>is easily put by.&nbsp; What a happy creature William must be!

<P>I wish we could see him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Poor Fanny's mind was thrown into the most distressing

<P>of all its varieties.&nbsp; The recollection of what had

<P>been done for William was always the most powerful

<P>disturber of every decision against Mr. Crawford;

<P>and she sat thinking deeply of it till Mary, who had been

<P>first watching her complacently, and then musing on

<P>something else, suddenly called her attention by saying:

<P>"I should like to sit talking with you here all day,

<P>but we must not forget the ladies below, and so good-bye,

<P>my dear, my amiable, my excellent Fanny, for though we

<P>shall nominally part in the breakfast-parlour, I must

<P>take leave of you here.&nbsp; And I do take leave, longing for

<P>a happy reunion, and trusting that when we meet again,

<P>it will be under circumstances which may open our hearts

<P>to each other without any remnant or shadow of reserve."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A very, very kind embrace, and some agitation of manner,

<P>accompanied these words.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I shall see your cousin in town soon:&nbsp; he talks of

<P>being there tolerably soon; and Sir Thomas, I dare say,

<P>in the course of the spring; and your eldest cousin,

<P>and the Rushworths, and Julia, I am sure of meeting again

<P>and again, and all but you.&nbsp; I have two favours to ask,

<P>Fanny:&nbsp; one is your correspondence.&nbsp; You must write to me.

<P>And the other, that you will often call on Mrs. Grant,

<P>and make her amends for my being gone."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The first, at least, of these favours Fanny would rather

<P>not have been asked; but it was impossible for her to refuse

<P>the correspondence; it was impossible for her even not to

<P>accede to it more readily than her own judgment authorised.

<P>There was no resisting so much apparent affection.

<P>Her disposition was peculiarly calculated to value a fond

<P>treatment, and from having hitherto known so little of it,

<P>she was the more overcome by Miss Crawford's. Besides,

<P>there was gratitude towards her, for having made their

<P>_tete-a-tete_ so much less painful than her fears had predicted.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was over, and she had escaped without reproaches

<P>and without detection.&nbsp; Her secret was still her own;

<P>and while that was the case, she thought she could resign

<P>herself to almost everything.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In the evening there was another parting.&nbsp; Henry Crawford

<P>came and sat some time with them; and her spirits not being

<P>previously in the strongest state, her heart was softened

<P>for a while towards him, because he really seemed to feel.

<P>Quite unlike his usual self, he scarcely said anything.

<P>He was evidently oppressed, and Fanny must grieve for him,

<P>though hoping she might never see him again till he were the

<P>husband of some other woman.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When it came to the moment of parting, he would take her hand,

<P>he would not be denied it; he said nothing, however,

<P>or nothing that she heard, and when he had left the room,

<P>she was better pleased that such a token of friendship

<P>had passed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>On the morrow the Crawfords were gone.
