<P>It had been a miserable party, each of the three believing

<P>themselves most miserable.&nbsp; Mrs. Norris, however, as most

<P>attached to Maria, was really the greatest sufferer.

<P>Maria was her first favourite, the dearest of all;

<P>the match had been her own contriving, as she had been

<P>wont with such pride of heart to feel and say, and this

<P>conclusion of it almost overpowered her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was an altered creature, quieted, stupefied, indifferent to

<P>everything that passed.&nbsp; The being left with her sister

<P>and nephew, and all the house under her care, had been

<P>an advantage entirely thrown away; she had been unable

<P>to direct or dictate, or even fancy herself useful.

<P>When really touched by affliction, her active powers

<P>had been all benumbed; and neither Lady Bertram nor Tom

<P>had received from her the smallest support or attempt

<P>at support.&nbsp; She had done no more for them than they

<P>had done for each other.&nbsp; They had been all solitary,

<P>helpless, and forlorn alike; and now the arrival of the

<P>others only established her superiority in wretchedness.

<P>Her companions were relieved, but there was no good

<P>for _her_.&nbsp; Edmund was almost as welcome to his brother

<P>as Fanny to her aunt; but Mrs. Norris, instead of having

<P>comfort from either, was but the more irritated by the

<P>sight of the person whom, in the blindness of her anger,

<P>she could have charged as the daemon of the piece.

<P>Had Fanny accepted Mr. Crawford this could not have happened.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Susan too was a grievance.&nbsp; She had not spirits to notice

<P>her in more than a few repulsive looks, but she felt

<P>her as a spy, and an intruder, and an indigent niece,

<P>and everything most odious.&nbsp; By her other aunt, Susan was

<P>received with quiet kindness.&nbsp; Lady Bertram could not

<P>give her much time, or many words, but she felt her,

<P>as Fanny's sister, to have a claim at Mansfield,

<P>and was ready to kiss and like her; and Susan was more

<P>than satisfied, for she came perfectly aware that nothing

<P>but ill-humour was to be expected from aunt Norris;

<P>and was so provided with happiness, so strong in that

<P>best of blessings, an escape from many certain evils,

<P>that she could have stood against a great deal more

<P>indifference than she met with from the others.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was now left a good deal to herself, to get acquainted

<P>with the house and grounds as she could, and spent her

<P>days very happily in so doing, while those who might

<P>otherwise have attended to her were shut up, or wholly

<P>occupied each with the person quite dependent on them,

<P>at this time, for everything like comfort; Edmund trying

<P>to bury his own feelings in exertions for the relief

<P>of his brother's, and Fanny devoted to her aunt Bertram,

<P>returning to every former office with more than former zeal,

<P>and thinking she could never do enough for one who seemed

<P>so much to want her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To talk over the dreadful business with Fanny, talk and lament,

<P>was all Lady Bertram's consolation.&nbsp; To be listened to and

<P>borne with, and hear the voice of kindness and sympathy

<P>in return, was everything that could be done for her.

<P>To be otherwise comforted was out of the question.

<P>The case admitted of no comfort.&nbsp; Lady Bertram did not

<P>think deeply, but, guided by Sir Thomas, she thought

<P>justly on all important points; and she saw, therefore,

<P>in all its enormity, what had happened, and neither

<P>endeavoured herself, nor required Fanny to advise her,

<P>to think little of guilt and infamy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her affections were not acute, nor was her mind tenacious.

<P>After a time, Fanny found it not impossible to direct

<P>her thoughts to other subjects, and revive some interest

<P>in the usual occupations; but whenever Lady Bertram _was_

<P>fixed on the event, she could see it only in one light,

<P>as comprehending the loss of a daughter, and a disgrace

<P>never to be wiped off.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny learnt from her all the particulars which had

<P>yet transpired.&nbsp; Her aunt was no very methodical narrator,

<P>but with the help of some letters to and from Sir Thomas,

<P>and what she already knew herself, and could reasonably

<P>combine, she was soon able to understand quite as much

<P>as she wished of the circumstances attending the story.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Rushworth had gone, for the Easter holidays,

<P>to Twickenham, with a family whom she had just grown

<P>intimate with:&nbsp; a family of lively, agreeable manners,

<P>and probably of morals and discretion to suit, for to _their_

<P>house Mr. Crawford had constant access at all times.

<P>His having been in the same neighbourhood Fanny already knew.

<P>Mr. Rushworth had been gone at this time to Bath, to pass

<P>a few days with his mother, and bring her back to town,

<P>and Maria was with these friends without any restraint,

<P>without even Julia; for Julia had removed from Wimpole Street

<P>two or three weeks before, on a visit to some relations

<P>of Sir Thomas; a removal which her father and mother were

<P>now disposed to attribute to some view of convenience

<P>on Mr. Yates's account.&nbsp; Very soon after the Rushworths'

<P>return to Wimpole Street, Sir Thomas had received a

<P>letter from an old and most particular friend in London,

<P>who hearing and witnessing a good deal to alarm him

<P>in that quarter, wrote to recommend Sir Thomas's coming

<P>to London himself, and using his influence with his

<P>daughter to put an end to the intimacy which was already

<P>exposing her to unpleasant remarks, and evidently making

<P>Mr. Rushworth uneasy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sir Thomas was preparing to act upon this letter, without

<P>communicating its contents to any creature at Mansfield,

<P>when it was followed by another, sent express from the

<P>same friend, to break to him the almost desperate situation

<P>in which affairs then stood with the young people.

<P>Mrs. Rushworth had left her husband's house:&nbsp; Mr. Rushworth

<P>had been in great anger and distress to _him_ (Mr. Harding)

<P>for his advice; Mr. Harding feared there had been _at_

<P>_least_ very flagrant indiscretion.&nbsp; The maidservant

<P>of Mrs. Rushworth, senior, threatened alarmingly.&nbsp; He was

<P>doing all in his power to quiet everything, with the hope

<P>of Mrs. Rushworth's return, but was so much counteracted

<P>in Wimpole Street by the influence of Mr. Rushworth's mother,

<P>that the worst consequences might be apprehended.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This dreadful communication could not be kept from the rest

<P>of the family.&nbsp; Sir Thomas set off, Edmund would go with him,

<P>and the others had been left in a state of wretchedness,

<P>inferior only to what followed the receipt of the next

<P>letters from London.&nbsp; Everything was by that time public

<P>beyond a hope.&nbsp; The servant of Mrs. Rushworth, the mother,

<P>had exposure in her power, and supported by her mistress,

<P>was not to be silenced.&nbsp; The two ladies, even in the short

<P>time they had been together, had disagreed; and the bitterness

<P>of the elder against her daughter-in-law might perhaps arise

<P>almost as much from the personal disrespect with which

<P>she had herself been treated as from sensibility for her son.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>However that might be, she was unmanageable.&nbsp; But had she

<P>been less obstinate, or of less weight with her son,

<P>who was always guided by the last speaker, by the person

<P>who could get hold of and shut him up, the case would

<P>still have been hopeless, for Mrs. Rushworth did not

<P>appear again, and there was every reason to conclude

<P>her to be concealed somewhere with Mr. Crawford,

<P>who had quitted his uncle's house, as for a journey,

<P>on the very day of her absenting herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sir Thomas, however, remained yet a little longer in town,

<P>in the hope of discovering and snatching her from farther vice,

<P>though all was lost on the side of character.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>_His_ present state Fanny could hardly bear to think of.

<P>There was but one of his children who was not at this time

<P>a source of misery to him.&nbsp; Tom's complaints had been

<P>greatly heightened by the shock of his sister's conduct,

<P>and his recovery so much thrown back by it, that even

<P>Lady Bertram had been struck by the difference, and all

<P>her alarms were regularly sent off to her husband;

<P>and Julia's elopement, the additional blow which had met

<P>him on his arrival in London, though its force had been

<P>deadened at the moment, must, she knew, be sorely felt.

<P>She saw that it was.&nbsp; His letters expressed how much he

<P>deplored it.&nbsp; Under any circumstances it would have been

<P>an unwelcome alliance; but to have it so clandestinely

<P>formed, and such a period chosen for its completion,

<P>placed Julia's feelings in a most unfavourable light,

<P>and severely aggravated the folly of her choice.

<P>He called it a bad thing, done in the worst manner,

<P>and at the worst time; and though Julia was yet as more

<P>pardonable than Maria as folly than vice, he could not

<P>but regard the step she had taken as opening the worst

<P>probabilities of a conclusion hereafter like her sister's.

<P>Such was his opinion of the set into which she had

<P>thrown herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny felt for him most acutely.&nbsp; He could have no comfort

<P>but in Edmund.&nbsp; Every other child must be racking his heart.

<P>His displeasure against herself she trusted, reasoning

<P>differently from Mrs. Norris, would now be done away.

<P>_She_ should be justified.&nbsp; Mr. Crawford would have

<P>fully acquitted her conduct in refusing him; but this,

<P>though most material to herself, would be poor consolation

<P>to Sir Thomas.&nbsp; Her uncle's displeasure was terrible to her;

<P>but what could her justification or her gratitude and

<P>attachment do for him?&nbsp; His stay must be on Edmund alone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was mistaken, however, in supposing that Edmund gave

<P>his father no present pain.&nbsp; It was of a much less poignant

<P>nature than what the others excited; but Sir Thomas

<P>was considering his happiness as very deeply involved

<P>in the offence of his sister and friend; cut off by it,

<P>as he must be, from the woman whom he had been pursuing

<P>with undoubted attachment and strong probability of success;

<P>and who, in everything but this despicable brother,

<P>would have been so eligible a connexion.&nbsp; He was aware

<P>of what Edmund must be suffering on his own behalf,

<P>in addition to all the rest, when they were in town:

<P>he had seen or conjectured his feelings; and, having reason

<P>to think that one interview with Miss Crawford had taken place,

<P>from which Edmund derived only increased distress, had been

<P>as anxious on that account as on others to get him out of town,

<P>and had engaged him in taking Fanny home to her aunt,

<P>with a view to his relief and benefit, no less than theirs.

<P>Fanny was not in the secret of her uncle's feelings,

<P>Sir Thomas not in the secret of Miss Crawford's character.

<P>Had he been privy to her conversation with his son, he would

<P>not have wished her to belong to him, though her twenty

<P>thousand pounds had been forty.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>That Edmund must be for ever divided from Miss Crawford did

<P>not admit of a doubt with Fanny; and yet, till she knew

<P>that he felt the same, her own conviction was insufficient.

<P>She thought he did, but she wanted to be assured of it.

<P>If he would now speak to her with the unreserve which

<P>had sometimes been too much for her before, it would

<P>be most consoling; but _that_ she found was not to be.

<P>She seldom saw him:&nbsp; never alone.&nbsp; He probably avoided

<P>being alone with her.&nbsp; What was to be inferred?&nbsp; That his

<P>judgment submitted to all his own peculiar and bitter share

<P>of this family affliction, but that it was too keenly

<P>felt to be a subject of the slightest communication.

<P>This must be his state.&nbsp; He yielded, but it was with

<P>agonies which did not admit of speech.&nbsp; Long, long would

<P>it be ere Miss Crawford's name passed his lips again,

<P>or she could hope for a renewal of such confidential

<P>intercourse as had been.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It _was_ long.&nbsp; They reached Mansfield on Thursday,

<P>and it was not till Sunday evening that Edmund began

<P>to talk to her on the subject.&nbsp; Sitting with her on

<P>Sunday evening--a wet Sunday evening--the very time of

<P>all others when, if a friend is at hand, the heart must

<P>be opened, and everything told; no one else in the room,

<P>except his mother, who, after hearing an affecting sermon,

<P>had cried herself to sleep, it was impossible not to speak;

<P>and so, with the usual beginnings, hardly to be traced

<P>as to what came first, and the usual declaration that

<P>if she would listen to him for a few minutes, he should

<P>be very brief, and certainly never tax her kindness

<P>in the same way again; she need not fear a repetition;

<P>it would be a subject prohibited entirely:&nbsp; he entered

<P>upon the luxury of relating circumstances and sensations

<P>of the first interest to himself, to one of whose

<P>affectionate sympathy he was quite convinced
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>How Fanny listened, with what curiosity and concern,

<P>what pain and what delight, how the agitation of his

<P>voice was watched, and how carefully her own eyes were

<P>fixed on any object but himself, may be imagined.

<P>The opening was alarming.&nbsp; He had seen Miss Crawford.

<P>He had been invited to see her.&nbsp; He had received a note

<P>from Lady Stornaway to beg him to call; and regarding

<P>it as what was meant to be the last, last interview

<P>of friendship, and investing her with all the feelings

<P>of shame and wretchedness which Crawford's sister ought

<P>to have known, he had gone to her in such a state of mind,

<P>so softened, so devoted, as made it for a few moments

<P>impossible to Fanny's fears that it should be the last.

<P>But as he proceeded in his story, these fears were over.

<P>She had met him, he said, with a serious--certainly a serious--

<P>even an agitated air; but before he had been able

<P>to speak one intelligible sentence, she had introduced

<P>the subject in a manner which he owned had shocked him.

<P>"'I heard you were in town,' said she; 'I wanted to see you.

<P>Let us talk over this sad business.&nbsp; What can equal the folly

<P>of our two relations?'&nbsp; I could not answer, but I believe

<P>my looks spoke.&nbsp; She felt reproved.&nbsp; Sometimes how quick

<P>to feel!&nbsp; With a graver look and voice she then added,

<P>'I do not mean to defend Henry at your sister's expense.'

<P>So she began, but how she went on, Fanny, is not fit,

<P>is hardly fit to be repeated to you.&nbsp; I cannot recall

<P>all her words.&nbsp; I would not dwell upon them if I could.

<P>Their substance was great anger at the _folly_ of each.

<P>She reprobated her brother's folly in being drawn on

<P>by a woman whom he had never cared for, to do what must

<P>lose him the woman he adored; but still more the folly of

<P>poor Maria, in sacrificing such a situation, plunging into

<P>such difficulties, under the idea of being really loved

<P>by a man who had long ago made his indifference clear.

<P>Guess what I must have felt.&nbsp; To hear the woman whom--

<P>no harsher name than folly given!&nbsp; So voluntarily,

<P>so freely, so coolly to canvass it!&nbsp; No reluctance,

<P>no horror, no feminine, shall I say, no modest loathings?

<P>This is what the world does.&nbsp; For where, Fanny, shall we

<P>find a woman whom nature had so richly endowed?&nbsp; Spoilt,

<P>spoilt!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After a little reflection, he went on with a sort

<P>of desperate calmness.&nbsp; "I will tell you everything,

<P>and then have done for ever.&nbsp; She saw it only as folly,

<P>and that folly stamped only by exposure.&nbsp; The want of

<P>common discretion, of caution:&nbsp; his going down to Richmond

<P>for the whole time of her being at Twickenham; her putting

<P>herself in the power of a servant; it was the detection,

<P>in short--oh, Fanny! it was the detection, not the offence,

<P>which she reprobated.&nbsp; It was the imprudence which had

<P>brought things to extremity, and obliged her brother

<P>to give up every dearer plan in order to fly with her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He stopt.&nbsp; "And what," said Fanny (believing herself

<P>required to speak), "what could you say?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nothing, nothing to be understood.&nbsp; I was like a man stunned.

<P>She went on, began to talk of you; yes, then she began

<P>to talk of you, regretting, as well she might, the loss

<P>of such a--.&nbsp; There she spoke very rationally.&nbsp; But she

<P>has always done justice to you.&nbsp; 'He has thrown away,'

<P>said she, 'such a woman as he will never see again.

<P>She would have fixed him; she would have made him happy

<P>for ever.'&nbsp; My dearest Fanny, I am giving you, I hope,

<P>more pleasure than pain by this retrospect of what might

<P>have been--but what never can be now.&nbsp; You do not wish me

<P>to be silent?&nbsp; If you do, give me but a look, a word, and I

<P>have done."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>No look or word was given.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Thank God," said he.&nbsp; "We were all disposed to wonder,

<P>but it seems to have been the merciful appointment

<P>of Providence that the heart which knew no guile

<P>should not suffer.&nbsp; She spoke of you with high praise

<P>and warm affection; yet, even here, there was alloy,

<P>a dash of evil; for in the midst of it she could exclaim,

<P>'Why would not she have him?&nbsp; It is all her fault.

<P>Simple girl!&nbsp; I shall never forgive her.&nbsp; Had she accepted

<P>him as she ought, they might now have been on the point

<P>of marriage, and Henry would have been too happy and too

<P>busy to want any other object.&nbsp; He would have taken

<P>no pains to be on terms with Mrs. Rushworth again.

<P>It would have all ended in a regular standing flirtation,

<P>in yearly meetings at Sotherton and Everingham.'&nbsp; Could you

<P>have believed it possible?&nbsp; But the charm is broken.

<P>My eyes are opened."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Cruel!" said Fanny, "quite cruel.&nbsp; At such a moment to

<P>give way to gaiety, to speak with lightness, and to you!

<P>Absolute cruelty."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Cruelty, do you call it?&nbsp; We differ there.&nbsp; No, hers is

<P>not a cruel nature.&nbsp; I do not consider her as meaning

<P>to wound my feelings.&nbsp; The evil lies yet deeper:

<P>in her total ignorance, unsuspiciousness of there being

<P>such feelings; in a perversion of mind which made it

<P>natural to her to treat the subject as she did.&nbsp; She was

<P>speaking only as she had been used to hear others speak,

<P>as she imagined everybody else would speak.&nbsp; Hers are

<P>not faults of temper.&nbsp; She would not voluntarily give

<P>unnecessary pain to any one, and though I may deceive myself,

<P>I cannot but think that for me, for my feelings, she would--

<P>Hers are faults of principle, Fanny; of blunted delicacy

<P>and a corrupted, vitiated mind.&nbsp; Perhaps it is best for me,

<P>since it leaves me so little to regret.&nbsp; Not so, however.

<P>Gladly would I submit to all the increased pain of

<P>losing her, rather than have to think of her as I do.

<P>I told her so."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Did you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes; when I left her I told her so."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How long were you together?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Five-and-twenty minutes.&nbsp; Well, she went on to say that

<P>what remained now to be done was to bring about a marriage

<P>between them.&nbsp; She spoke of it, Fanny, with a steadier

<P>voice than I can."&nbsp; He was obliged to pause more than once

<P>as he continued.&nbsp; "'We must persuade Henry to marry her,'

<P>said she; 'and what with honour, and the certainty of having

<P>shut himself out for ever from Fanny, I do not despair

<P>of it.&nbsp; Fanny he must give up.&nbsp; I do not think that even

<P>_he_ could now hope to succeed with one of her stamp,

<P>and therefore I hope we may find no insuperable difficulty.

<P>My influence, which is not small shall all go that way;

<P>and when once married, and properly supported by her

<P>own family, people of respectability as they are, she may

<P>recover her footing in society to a certain degree.

<P>In some circles, we know, she would never be admitted,

<P>but with good dinners, and large parties, there will

<P>always be those who will be glad of her acquaintance;

<P>and there is, undoubtedly, more liberality and candour

<P>on those points than formerly.&nbsp; What I advise is,

<P>that your father be quiet.&nbsp; Do not let him injure his own

<P>cause by interference.&nbsp; Persuade him to let things take

<P>their course.&nbsp; If by any officious exertions of his,

<P>she is induced to leave Henry's protection, there will be

<P>much less chance of his marrying her than if she remain

<P>with him.&nbsp; I know how he is likely to be influenced.

<P>Let Sir Thomas trust to his honour and compassion, and it

<P>may all end well; but if he get his daughter away, it will

<P>be destroying the chief hold.'"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After repeating this, Edmund was so much affected that Fanny,

<P>watching him with silent, but most tender concern,

<P>was almost sorry that the subject had been entered

<P>on at all.&nbsp; It was long before he could speak again.

<P>At last, "Now, Fanny," said he, "I shall soon have done.

<P>I have told you the substance of all that she said.

<P>As soon as I could speak, I replied that I had not

<P>supposed it possible, coming in such a state of mind

<P>into that house as I had done, that anything could

<P>occur to make me suffer more, but that she had been

<P>inflicting deeper wounds in almost every sentence.

<P>That though I had, in the course of our acquaintance,

<P>been often sensible of some difference in our opinions,

<P>on points, too, of some moment, it had not entered my

<P>imagination to conceive the difference could be such as she

<P>had now proved it.&nbsp; That the manner in which she treated

<P>the dreadful crime committed by her brother and my sister

<P>(with whom lay the greater seduction I pretended not to say),

<P>but the manner in which she spoke of the crime itself,

<P>giving it every reproach but the right; considering its ill

<P>consequences only as they were to be braved or overborne

<P>by a defiance of decency and impudence in wrong; and last

<P>of all, and above all, recommending to us a compliance,

<P>a compromise, an acquiescence in the continuance of the sin,

<P>on the chance of a marriage which, thinking as I now thought

<P>of her brother, should rather be prevented than sought;

<P>all this together most grievously convinced me that I had

<P>never understood her before, and that, as far as related

<P>to mind, it had been the creature of my own imagination,

<P>not Miss Crawford, that I had been too apt to dwell on

<P>for many months past.&nbsp; That, perhaps, it was best for me;

<P>I had less to regret in sacrificing a friendship, feelings,

<P>hopes which must, at any rate, have been torn from me now.

<P>And yet, that I must and would confess that, could I

<P>have restored her to what she had appeared to me before,

<P>I would infinitely prefer any increase of the pain

<P>of parting, for the sake of carrying with me the right of

<P>tenderness and esteem.&nbsp; This is what I said, the purport

<P>of it; but, as you may imagine, not spoken so collectedly

<P>or methodically as I have repeated it to you.&nbsp; She was

<P>astonished, exceedingly astonished--more than astonished.

<P>I saw her change countenance.&nbsp; She turned extremely red.

<P>I imagined I saw a mixture of many feelings:&nbsp; a great,

<P>though short struggle; half a wish of yielding to truths,

<P>half a sense of shame, but habit, habit carried it.

<P>She would have laughed if she could.&nbsp; It was a sort of laugh,

<P>as she answered, 'A pretty good lecture, upon my word.

<P>Was it part of your last sermon?&nbsp; At this rate you will

<P>soon reform everybody at Mansfield and Thornton Lacey;

<P>and when I hear of you next, it may be as a celebrated preacher

<P>in some great society of Methodists, or as a missionary

<P>into foreign parts.'&nbsp; She tried to speak carelessly,

<P>but she was not so careless as she wanted to appear.

<P>I only said in reply, that from my heart I wished her well,

<P>and earnestly hoped that she might soon learn to think

<P>more justly, and not owe the most valuable knowledge we

<P>could any of us acquire, the knowledge of ourselves and of

<P>our duty, to the lessons of affliction, and immediately

<P>left the room.&nbsp; I had gone a few steps, Fanny, when I

<P>heard the door open behind me.&nbsp; 'Mr. Bertram,' said she.

<P>I looked back.&nbsp; 'Mr. Bertram,' said she, with a smile;

<P>but it was a smile ill-suited to the conversation that

<P>had passed, a saucy playful smile, seeming to invite

<P>in order to subdue me; at least it appeared so to me.

<P>I resisted; it was the impulse of the moment to resist,

<P>and still walked on.&nbsp; I have since, sometimes, for a moment,

<P>regretted that I did not go back, but I know I was right,

<P>and such has been the end of our acquaintance.&nbsp; And what

<P>an acquaintance has it been!&nbsp; How have I been deceived!

<P>Equally in brother and sister deceived!&nbsp; I thank you for

<P>your patience, Fanny.&nbsp; This has been the greatest relief,

<P>and now we will have done."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And such was Fanny's dependence on his words, that for five

<P>minutes she thought they _had_ done.&nbsp; Then, however, it all

<P>came on again, or something very like it, and nothing

<P>less than Lady Bertram's rousing thoroughly up could

<P>really close such a conversation.&nbsp; Till that happened,

<P>they continued to talk of Miss Crawford alone, and how she

<P>had attached him, and how delightful nature had made her,

<P>and how excellent she would have been, had she fallen into

<P>good hands earlier.&nbsp; Fanny, now at liberty to speak openly,

<P>felt more than justified in adding to his knowledge

<P>of her real character, by some hint of what share his

<P>brother's state of health might be supposed to have in

<P>her wish for a complete reconciliation.&nbsp; This was not an

<P>agreeable intimation.&nbsp; Nature resisted it for a while.

<P>It would have been a vast deal pleasanter to have had

<P>her more disinterested in her attachment; but his vanity

<P>was not of a strength to fight long against reason.

<P>He submitted to believe that Tom's illness had influenced her,

<P>only reserving for himself this consoling thought,

<P>that considering the many counteractions of opposing habits,

<P>she had certainly been _more_ attached to him than could

<P>have been expected, and for his sake been more near

<P>doing right.&nbsp; Fanny thought exactly the same; and they were

<P>also quite agreed in their opinion of the lasting effect,

<P>the indelible impression, which such a disappointment

<P>must make on his mind.&nbsp; Time would undoubtedly abate

<P>somewhat of his sufferings, but still it was a sort

<P>of thing which he never could get entirely the better of;

<P>and as to his ever meeting with any other woman who could--

<P>it was too impossible to be named but with indignation.

<P>Fanny's friendship was all that he had to cling to.
