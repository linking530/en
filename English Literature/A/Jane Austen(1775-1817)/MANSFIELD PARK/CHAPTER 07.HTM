<P>"Well, Fanny, and how do you like Miss Crawford _now_?"

<P>said Edmund the next day, after thinking some time on the

<P>subject himself.&nbsp; "How did you like her yesterday?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very well--very much.&nbsp; I like to hear her talk.

<P>She entertains me; and she is so extremely pretty, that I

<P>have great pleasure in looking at her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is her countenance that is so attractive.&nbsp; She has

<P>a wonderful play of feature!&nbsp; But was there nothing in her

<P>conversation that struck you, Fanny, as not quite right?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh yes! she ought not to have spoken of her uncle as she did.

<P>I was quite astonished.&nbsp; An uncle with whom she has been

<P>living so many years, and who, whatever his faults may be,

<P>is so very fond of her brother, treating him, they say,

<P>quite like a son.&nbsp; I could not have believed it!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I thought you would be struck.&nbsp; It was very wrong;

<P>very indecorous."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And very ungrateful, I think."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ungrateful is a strong word.&nbsp; I do not know that her uncle

<P>has any claim to her _gratitude_; his wife certainly had;

<P>and it is the warmth of her respect for her aunt's memory

<P>which misleads her here.&nbsp; She is awkwardly circumstanced.

<P>With such warm feelings and lively spirits it must be

<P>difficult to do justice to her affection for Mrs. Crawford,

<P>without throwing a shade on the Admiral.&nbsp; I do not pretend

<P>to know which was most to blame in their disagreements,

<P>though the Admiral's present conduct might incline one

<P>to the side of his wife; but it is natural and amiable

<P>that Miss Crawford should acquit her aunt entirely.

<P>I do not censure her _opinions_; but there certainly _is_

<P>impropriety in making them public."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do not you think," said Fanny, after a little consideration,

<P>"that this impropriety is a reflection itself upon

<P>Mrs. Crawford, as her niece has been entirely brought

<P>up by her?&nbsp; She cannot have given her right notions

<P>of what was due to the Admiral."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That is a fair remark.&nbsp; Yes, we must suppose the faults

<P>of the niece to have been those of the aunt; and it makes

<P>one more sensible of the disadvantages she has been under.

<P>But I think her present home must do her good.

<P>Mrs. Grant's manners are just what they ought to be.

<P>She speaks of her brother with a very pleasing affection."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, except as to his writing her such short letters.

<P>She made me almost laugh; but I cannot rate so very highly

<P>the love or good-nature of a brother who will not give

<P>himself the trouble of writing anything worth reading

<P>to his sisters, when they are separated.&nbsp; I am sure William

<P>would never have used _me_ so, under any circumstances.

<P>And what right had she to suppose that _you_ would not write

<P>long letters when you were absent?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The right of a lively mind, Fanny, seizing whatever

<P>may contribute to its own amusement or that of others;

<P>perfectly allowable, when untinctured by ill-humour

<P>or roughness; and there is not a shadow of either in the

<P>countenance or manner of Miss Crawford:&nbsp; nothing sharp,

<P>or loud, or coarse.&nbsp; She is perfectly feminine, except m

<P>the instances we have been speaking of.&nbsp; There she cannot

<P>be justified.&nbsp; I am glad you saw it all as I did."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Having formed her mind and gained her affections, he had a

<P>good chance of her thinking like him; though at this period,

<P>and on this subject, there began now to be some danger

<P>of dissimilarity, for he was in a line of admiration

<P>of Miss Crawford, which might lead him where Fanny could

<P>not follow.&nbsp; Miss Crawford's attractions did not lessen.

<P>The harp arrived, and rather added to her beauty, wit,

<P>and good-humour; for she played with the greatest obligingness,

<P>with an expression and taste which were peculiarly becoming,

<P>and there was something clever to be said at the close

<P>of every air.&nbsp; Edmund was at the Parsonage every day,

<P>to be indulged with his favourite instrument:

<P>one morning secured an invitation for the next;

<P>for the lady could not be unwilling to have a listener,

<P>and every thing was soon in a fair train.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A young woman, pretty, lively, with a harp as

<P>elegant as herself, and both placed near a window,

<P>cut down to the ground, and opening on a little lawn,

<P>surrounded by shrubs in the rich foliage of summer,

<P>was enough to catch any man's heart.&nbsp; The season, the scene,

<P>the air, were all favourable to tenderness and sentiment.

<P>Mrs. Grant and her tambour frame were not without their use:

<P>it was all in harmony; and as everything will turn to account

<P>when love is once set going, even the sandwich tray,

<P>and Dr. Grant doing the honours of it, were worth looking at.

<P>Without studying the business, however, or knowing

<P>what he was about, Edmund was beginning, at the end

<P>of a week of such intercourse, to be a good deal in love;

<P>and to the credit of the lady it may be added that,

<P>without his being a man of the world or an elder brother,

<P>without any of the arts of flattery or the gaieties of

<P>small talk, he began to be agreeable to her.&nbsp; She felt it

<P>to be so, though she had not foreseen, and could hardly

<P>understand it; for he was not pleasant by any common rule:

<P>he talked no nonsense; he paid no compliments; his opinions

<P>were unbending, his attentions tranquil and simple.

<P>There was a charm, perhaps, in his sincerity, his steadiness,

<P>his integrity, which Miss Crawford might be equal

<P>to feel, though not equal to discuss with herself.

<P>She did not think very much about it, however:&nbsp; he pleased

<P>her for the present; she liked to have him near her;

<P>it was enough.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny could not wonder that Edmund was at the Parsonage

<P>every morning; she would gladly have been there too,

<P>might she have gone in uninvited and unnoticed, to hear

<P>the harp; neither could she wonder that, when the evening

<P>stroll was over, and the two families parted again,

<P>he should think it right to attend Mrs. Grant and her

<P>sister to their home, while Mr. Crawford was devoted

<P>to the ladies of the Park; but she thought it a very

<P>bad exchange; and if Edmund were not there to mix the wine

<P>and water for her, would rather go without it than not.

<P>She was a little surprised that he could spend so many

<P>hours with Miss Crawford, and not see more of the sort

<P>of fault which he had already observed, and of which _she_

<P>was almost always reminded by a something of the same

<P>nature whenever she was in her company; but so it was.

<P>Edmund was fond of speaking to her of Miss Crawford,

<P>but he seemed to think it enough that the Admiral had

<P>since been spared; and she scrupled to point out her own

<P>remarks to him, lest it should appear like ill-nature.

<P>The first actual pain which Miss Crawford occasioned her

<P>was the consequence of an inclination to learn to ride,

<P>which the former caught, soon after her being settled

<P>at Mansfield, from the example of the young ladies at the Park,

<P>and which, when Edmund's acquaintance with her increased,

<P>led to his encouraging the wish, and the offer of his own

<P>quiet mare for the purpose of her first attempts, as the best

<P>fitted for a beginner that either stable could furnish.

<P>No pain, no injury, however, was designed by him to his

<P>cousin in this offer:&nbsp; _she_ was not to lose a day's exercise

<P>by it.&nbsp; The mare was only to be taken down to the Parsonage

<P>half an hour before her ride were to begin; and Fanny,

<P>on its being first proposed, so far from feeling slighted,

<P>was almost over-powered with gratitude that he should be

<P>asking her leave for it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Miss Crawford made her first essay with great credit

<P>to herself, and no inconvenience to Fanny.&nbsp; Edmund,

<P>who had taken down the mare and presided at the whole,

<P>returned with it in excellent time, before either Fanny

<P>or the steady old coachman, who always attended her when

<P>she rode without her cousins, were ready to set forward.

<P>The second day's trial was not so guiltless.&nbsp; Miss Crawford's

<P>enjoyment of riding was such that she did not know how to

<P>leave off.&nbsp; Active and fearless, and though rather small,

<P>strongly made, she seemed formed for a horsewoman; and to

<P>the pure genuine pleasure of the exercise, something was

<P>probably added in Edmund's attendance and instructions,

<P>and something more in the conviction of very much surpassing

<P>her sex in general by her early progress, to make her

<P>unwilling to dismount.&nbsp; Fanny was ready and waiting,

<P>and Mrs. Norris was beginning to scold her for not being gone,

<P>and still no horse was announced, no Edmund appeared.

<P>To avoid her aunt, and look for him, she went out.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The houses, though scarcely half a mile apart, were not

<P>within sight of each other; but, by walking fifty yards

<P>from the hall door, she could look down the park,

<P>and command a view of the Parsonage and all its demesnes,

<P>gently rising beyond the village road; and in Dr. Grant's

<P>meadow she immediately saw the group--Edmund and Miss

<P>Crawford both on horse-back, riding side by side, Dr. and

<P>Mrs. Grant, and Mr. Crawford, with two or three grooms,

<P>standing about and looking on.&nbsp; A happy party it appeared

<P>to her, all interested in one object:&nbsp; cheerful beyond

<P>a doubt, for the sound of merriment ascended even to her.

<P>It was a sound which did not make _her_ cheerful;

<P>she wondered that Edmund should forget her, and felt

<P>a pang.&nbsp; She could not turn her eyes from the meadow;

<P>she could not help watching all that passed.&nbsp; At first Miss

<P>Crawford and her companion made the circuit of the field,

<P>which was not small, at a foot's pace; then, at _her_

<P>apparent suggestion, they rose into a canter; and to Fanny's

<P>timid nature it was most astonishing to see how well

<P>she sat.&nbsp; After a few minutes they stopped entirely.

<P>Edmund was close to her; he was speaking to her;

<P>he was evidently directing her management of the bridle;

<P>he had hold of her hand; she saw it, or the imagination

<P>supplied what the eye could not reach.&nbsp; She
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>must not wonder at all this; what could be more natural

<P>than that Edmund should be making himself useful,

<P>and proving his good-nature by any one?&nbsp; She could not

<P>but think, indeed, that Mr. Crawford might as well have

<P>saved him the trouble; that it would have been particularly

<P>proper and becoming in a brother to have done it himself;

<P>but Mr. Crawford, with all his boasted good-nature, and all

<P>his coachmanship, probably knew nothing of the matter,

<P>and had no active kindness in comparison of Edmund.

<P>She began to think it rather hard upon the mare to have

<P>such double duty; if she were forgotten, the poor mare

<P>should be remembered.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her feelings for one and the other were soon a little

<P>tranquillised by seeing the party in the meadow disperse,

<P>and Miss Crawford still on horseback, but attended by Edmund

<P>on foot, pass through a gate into the lane, and so into

<P>the park, and make towards the spot where she stood.

<P>She began then to be afraid of appearing rude and impatient;

<P>and walked to meet them with a great anxiety to avoid

<P>the suspicion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear Miss Price," said Miss Crawford, as soon as she

<P>was at all within hearing, "I am come to make my own

<P>apologies for keeping you waiting; but I have nothing

<P>in the world to say for myself--I knew it was very late,

<P>and that I was behaving extremely ill; and therefore,

<P>if you please, you must forgive me.&nbsp; Selfishness must

<P>always be forgiven, you know, because there is no hope

<P>of a cure."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny's answer was extremely civil, and Edmund added

<P>his conviction that she could be in no hurry.&nbsp; "For there

<P>is more than time enough for my cousin to ride twice

<P>as far as she ever goes," said he, "and you have been

<P>promoting her comfort by preventing her from setting off

<P>half an hour sooner:&nbsp; clouds are now coming up, and she

<P>will not suffer from the heat as she would have done then.

<P>I wish _you_ may not be fatigued by so much exercise.

<P>I wish you had saved yourself this walk home."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No part of it fatigues me but getting off this horse,

<P>I assure you," said she, as she sprang down with his help;

<P>"I am very strong.&nbsp; Nothing ever fatigues me but doing

<P>what I do not like.&nbsp; Miss Price, I give way to you with

<P>a very bad grace; but I sincerely hope you will have

<P>a pleasant ride, and that I may have nothing but good

<P>to hear of this dear, delightful, beautiful animal."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The old coachman, who had been waiting about with his

<P>own horse, now joining them, Fanny was lifted on hers,

<P>and they set off across another part of the park;

<P>her feelings of discomfort not lightened by seeing,

<P>as she looked back, that the others were walking down

<P>the hill together to the village; nor did her attendant

<P>do her much good by his comments on Miss Crawford's great

<P>cleverness as a horse-woman, which he had been watching

<P>with an interest almost equal to her own.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is a pleasure to see a lady with such a good heart

<P>for riding!" said he.&nbsp; "I never see one sit a horse better.

<P>She did not seem to have a thought of fear.&nbsp; Very different

<P>from you, miss, when you first began, six years ago come

<P>next Easter.&nbsp; Lord bless you! how you did tremble when Sir

<P>Thomas first had you put on!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In the drawing-room Miss Crawford was also celebrated.

<P>Her merit in being gifted by Nature with strength

<P>and courage was fully appreciated by the Miss Bertrams;

<P>her delight in riding was like their own; her early

<P>excellence in it was like their own, and they had great

<P>pleasure in praising it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I was sure she would ride well," said Julia; "she has

<P>the make for it.&nbsp; Her figure is as neat as her brother's."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes," added Maria, "and her spirits are as good, and she

<P>has the same energy of character.&nbsp; I cannot but think

<P>that good horsemanship has a great deal to do with the mind."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When they parted at night Edmund asked Fanny whether she

<P>meant to ride the next day.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, I do not know--not if you want the mare," was her answer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not want her at all for myself," said he;

<P>"'but whenever you are next inclined to stay at home,

<P>I think Miss Crawford would be glad to have her a longer time--

<P>for a whole morning, in short.&nbsp; She has a great desire to get

<P>as far as Mansfield Common:&nbsp; Mrs. Grant has been telling

<P>her of its fine views, and I have no doubt of her being

<P>perfectly equal to it.&nbsp; But any morning will do for this.

<P>She would be extremely sorry to interfere with you.

<P>It would be very wrong if she did.&nbsp; _She_ rides only

<P>for pleasure; _you_ for health."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I shall not ride to-morrow, certainly," said Fanny;

<P>"I have been out very often lately, and would rather

<P>stay at home.&nbsp; You know I am strong enough now to walk

<P>very well."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Edmund looked pleased, which must be Fanny's comfort,

<P>and the ride to Mansfield Common took place the next morning:

<P>the party included all the young people but herself,

<P>and was much enjoyed at the time, and doubly enjoyed

<P>again in the evening discussion.&nbsp; A successful scheme

<P>of this sort generally brings on another; and the having

<P>been to Mansfield Common disposed them all for going

<P>somewhere else the day after.&nbsp; There were many other

<P>views to be shewn; and though the weather was hot,

<P>there were shady lanes wherever they wanted to go.

<P>A young party is always provided with a shady lane.

<P>Four fine mornings successively were spent in this manner,

<P>in shewing the Crawfords the country, and doing the

<P>honours of its finest spots.&nbsp; Everything answered;

<P>it was all gaiety and good-humour, the heat only supplying

<P>inconvenience enough to be talked of with pleasure--

<P>till the fourth day, when the happiness of one of the party

<P>was exceedingly clouded.&nbsp; Miss Bertram was the one.

<P>Edmund and Julia were invited to dine at the Parsonage,

<P>and _she_ was excluded.&nbsp; It was meant and done by Mrs. Grant,

<P>with perfect good-humour, on Mr. Rushworth's account,

<P>who was partly expected at the Park that day; but it was felt

<P>as a very grievous injury, and her good manners were severely

<P>taxed to conceal her vexation and anger till she reached home.

<P>As Mr. Rushworth did _not_ come, the injury was increased,

<P>and she had not even the relief of shewing her power over him;

<P>she could only be sullen to her mother, aunt, and cousin,

<P>and throw as great a gloom as possible over their dinner

<P>and dessert.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Between ten and eleven Edmund and Julia walked into the

<P>drawing-room, fresh with the evening air, glowing and cheerful,

<P>the very reverse of what they found in the three ladies

<P>sitting there, for Maria would scarcely raise her eyes

<P>from her book, and Lady Bertram was half-asleep; and even

<P>Mrs. Norris, discomposed by her niece's ill-humour,

<P>and having asked one or two questions about the dinner,

<P>which were not immediately attended to, seemed almost

<P>determined to say no more.&nbsp; For a few minutes the brother

<P>and sister were too eager in their praise of the night

<P>and their remarks on the stars, to think beyond themselves;

<P>but when the first pause came, Edmund, looking around,

<P>said, "But where is Fanny?&nbsp; Is she gone to bed?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, not that I know of," replied Mrs. Norris; "she was

<P>here a moment ago."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her own gentle voice speaking from the other end

<P>of the room, which was a very long one, told them

<P>that she was on the sofa.&nbsp; Mrs. Norris began scolding.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That is a very foolish trick, Fanny, to be idling away all

<P>the evening upon a sofa.&nbsp; Why cannot you come and sit here,

<P>and employ yourself as _we_ do?&nbsp; If you have no work

<P>of your own, I can supply you from the poor basket.

<P>There is all the new calico, that was bought last week,

<P>not touched yet.&nbsp; I am sure I almost broke my back

<P>by cutting it out.&nbsp; You should learn to think of

<P>other people; and, take my word for it, it is a shocking

<P>trick for a young person to be always lolling upon a sofa."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Before half this was said, Fanny was returned to her

<P>seat at the table, and had taken up her work again;

<P>and Julia, who was in high good-humour, from the pleasures

<P>of the day, did her the justice of exclaiming, "I must say,

<P>ma'am, that Fanny is as little upon the sofa as anybody

<P>in the house."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Fanny," said Edmund, after looking at her attentively,

<P>"I am sure you have the headache."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She could not deny it, but said it was not very bad.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I can hardly believe you," he replied; "I know your looks

<P>too well.&nbsp; How long have you had it?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Since a little before dinner.&nbsp; It is nothing but the heat."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Did you go out in the heat?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Go out! to be sure she did," said Mrs. Norris:

<P>"would you have her stay within such a fine day as this?

<P>Were not we _all_ out?&nbsp; Even your mother was out to-day

<P>for above an hour."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, indeed, Edmund," added her ladyship, who had been

<P>thoroughly awakened by Mrs. Norris's sharp reprimand

<P>to Fanny; "I was out above an hour.&nbsp; I sat three-quarters

<P>of an hour in the flower-garden, while Fanny cut the roses;

<P>and very pleasant it was, I assure you, but very hot.

<P>It was shady enough in the alcove, but I declare I quite

<P>dreaded the coming home again."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Fanny has been cutting roses, has she?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, and I am afraid they will be the last this year.

<P>Poor thing!&nbsp; _She_ found it hot enough; but they were so

<P>full-blown that one could not wait."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There was no help for it, certainly," rejoined Mrs. Norris,

<P>in a rather softened voice; "but I question whether her

<P>headache might not be caught _then_, sister.&nbsp; There is

<P>nothing so likely to give it as standing and stooping

<P>in a hot sun; but I dare say it will be well to-morrow.

<P>Suppose you let her have your aromatic vinegar; I always

<P>forget to have mine filled."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She has got it," said Lady Bertram; "she has had it ever

<P>since she came back from your house the second time."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What!" cried Edmund; "has she been walking as well as

<P>cutting roses; walking across the hot park to your house,

<P>and doing it twice, ma'am?&nbsp; No wonder her head aches."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Norris was talking to Julia, and did not hear.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I was afraid it would be too much for her," said Lady Bertram;

<P>"but when the roses were gathered, your aunt wished

<P>to have them, and then you know they must be taken home."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But were there roses enough to oblige her to go twice?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No; but they were to be put into the spare room to dry;

<P>and, unluckily, Fanny forgot to lock the door of the room

<P>and bring away the key, so she was obliged to go again."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Edmund got up and walked about the room, saying, "And could

<P>nobody be employed on such an errand but Fanny?&nbsp; Upon my word,

<P>ma'am, it has been a very ill-managed business."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am sure I do not know how it was to have been done better,"

<P>cried Mrs. Norris, unable to be longer deaf; "unless I had

<P>gone myself, indeed; but I cannot be in two places at once;

<P>and I was talking to Mr. Green at that very time about

<P>your mother's dairymaid, by _her_ desire, and had promised

<P>John Groom to write to Mrs. Jefferies about his son,

<P>and the poor fellow was waiting for me half an hour.

<P>I think nobody can justly accuse me of sparing myself upon

<P>any occasion, but really I cannot do everything at once.

<P>And as for Fanny's just stepping down to my house for me--

<P>it is not much above a quarter of a mile--I cannot think I

<P>was unreasonable to ask it.&nbsp; How often do I pace it three

<P>times a day, early and late, ay, and in all weathers too,

<P>and say nothing about it?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I wish Fanny had half your strength, ma'am."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If Fanny would be more regular in her exercise, she would

<P>not be knocked up so soon.&nbsp; She has not been out on

<P>horseback now this long while, and I am persuaded that,

<P>when she does not ride, she ought to walk.&nbsp; If she had

<P>been riding before, I should not have asked it of her.

<P>But I thought it would rather do her good after being

<P>stooping among the roses; for there is nothing so

<P>refreshing as a walk after a fatigue of that kind;

<P>and though the sun was strong, it was not so very hot.

<P>Between ourselves, Edmund," nodding significantly at

<P>his mother, "it was cutting the roses, and dawdling

<P>about in the flower-garden, that did the mischief."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am afraid it was, indeed," said the more candid

<P>Lady Bertram, who had overheard her; "I am very much afraid

<P>she caught the headache there, for the heat was enough

<P>to kill anybody.&nbsp; It was as much as I could bear myself.

<P>Sitting and calling to Pug, and trying to keep him from

<P>the flower-beds, was almost too much for me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Edmund said no more to either lady; but going quietly

<P>to another table, on which the supper-tray yet remained,

<P>brought a glass of Madeira to Fanny, and obliged her to drink

<P>the greater part.&nbsp; She wished to be able to decline it;

<P>but the tears, which a variety of feelings created,

<P>made it easier to swallow than to speak.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Vexed as Edmund was with his mother and aunt, he was still

<P>more angry with himself.&nbsp; His own forgetfulness of her was

<P>worse than anything which they had done.&nbsp; Nothing of this

<P>would have happened had she been properly considered;

<P>but she had been left four days together without any choice

<P>of companions or exercise, and without any excuse for

<P>avoiding whatever her unreasonable aunts might require.

<P>He was ashamed to think that for four days together she had

<P>not had the power of riding, and very seriously resolved,

<P>however unwilling he must be to check a pleasure of Miss

<P>Crawford's, that it should never happen again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny went to bed with her heart as full as on the first

<P>evening of her arrival at the Park.&nbsp; The state of her

<P>spirits had probably had its share in her indisposition;

<P>for she had been feeling neglected, and been struggling

<P>against discontent and envy for some days past.

<P>As she leant on the sofa, to which she had retreated

<P>that she might not be seen, the pain of her mind

<P>had been much beyond that in her head; and the sudden

<P>change which Edmund's kindness had then occasioned,

<P>made her hardly know how to support herself.
