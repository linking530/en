<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>Fanny's rides recommenced the very next day; and as it

<P>was a pleasant fresh-feeling morning, less hot than the

<P>weather had lately been, Edmund trusted that her losses,

<P>both of health and pleasure, would be soon made good.

<P>While she was gone Mr. Rushworth arrived, escorting his mother,

<P>who came to be civil and to shew her civility especially,

<P>in urging the execution of the plan for visiting Sotherton,

<P>which had been started a fortnight before, and which,

<P>in consequence of her subsequent absence from home,

<P>had since lain dormant.&nbsp; Mrs. Norris and her nieces were all

<P>well pleased with its revival, and an early day was named

<P>and agreed to, provided Mr. Crawford should be disengaged:

<P>the young ladies did not forget that stipulation, and though

<P>Mrs. Norris would willingly have answered for his being so,

<P>they would neither authorise the liberty nor run the risk;

<P>and at last, on a hint from Miss Bertram, Mr. Rushworth

<P>discovered that the properest thing to be done was for

<P>him to walk down to the Parsonage directly, and call on

<P>Mr. Crawford, and inquire whether Wednesday would suit him

<P>or not.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Before his return Mrs. Grant and Miss Crawford came in.

<P>Having been out some time, and taken a different route

<P>to the house, they had not met him.&nbsp; Comfortable hopes,

<P>however, were given that he would find Mr. Crawford

<P>at home.&nbsp; The Sotherton scheme was mentioned of course.

<P>It was hardly possible, indeed, that anything else should

<P>be talked of, for Mrs. Norris was in high spirits about it;

<P>and Mrs. Rushworth, a well-meaning, civil, prosing,

<P>pompous woman, who thought nothing of consequence, but as it

<P>related to her own and her son's concerns, had not yet

<P>given over pressing Lady Bertram to be of the party.

<P>Lady Bertram constantly declined it; but her placid manner

<P>of refusal made Mrs. Rushworth still think she wished

<P>to come, till Mrs. Norris's more numerous words and louder

<P>tone convinced her of the truth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The fatigue would be too much for my sister, a great

<P>deal too much, I assure you, my dear Mrs. Rushworth.

<P>Ten miles there, and ten back, you know.&nbsp; You must

<P>excuse my sister on this occasion, and accept of our

<P>two dear girls and myself without her.&nbsp; Sotherton is

<P>the only place that could give her a _wish_ to go so far,

<P>but it cannot be, indeed.&nbsp; She will have a companion

<P>in Fanny Price, you know, so it will all do very well;

<P>and as for Edmund, as he is not here to speak for himself,

<P>I will answer for his being most happy to join the party.

<P>He can go on horseback, you know."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Rushworth being obliged to yield to Lady Bertram's

<P>staying at home, could only be sorry.&nbsp; "The loss of her

<P>ladyship's company would be a great drawback, and she

<P>should have been extremely happy to have seen the young

<P>lady too, Miss Price, who had never been at Sotherton yet,

<P>and it was a pity she should not see the place."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are very kind, you are all kindness, my dear madam,"

<P>cried Mrs. Norris; "but as to Fanny, she will have

<P>opportunities in plenty of seeing Sotherton.&nbsp; She has

<P>time enough before her; and her going now is quite out

<P>of the question.&nbsp; Lady Bertram could not possibly spare her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh no!&nbsp; I cannot do without Fanny."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Rushworth proceeded next, under the conviction that

<P>everybody must be wanting to see Sotherton, to include

<P>Miss Crawford in the invitation; and though Mrs. Grant,

<P>who had not been at the trouble of visiting Mrs. Rushworth,

<P>on her coming into the neighbourhood, civilly declined it

<P>on her own account, she was glad to secure any pleasure

<P>for her sister; and Mary, properly pressed and persuaded,

<P>was not long in accepting her share of the civility.

<P>Mr. Rushworth came back from the Parsonage successful;

<P>and Edmund made his appearance just in time to learn what

<P>had been settled for Wednesday, to attend Mrs. Rushworth

<P>to her carriage, and walk half-way down the park with the two

<P>other ladies.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>On his return to the breakfast-room, he found Mrs. Norris

<P>trying to make up her mind as to whether Miss Crawford's

<P>being of the party were desirable or not, or whether

<P>her brother's barouche would not be full without her.

<P>The Miss Bertrams laughed at the idea, assuring her

<P>that the barouche would hold four perfectly well,

<P>independent of the box, on which _one_ might go with him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But why is it necessary," said Edmund, "that Crawford's carriage,

<P>or his _only_, should be employed?&nbsp; Why is no use to be

<P>made of my mother's chaise?&nbsp; I could not, when the scheme

<P>was first mentioned the other day, understand why a visit

<P>from the family were not to be made in the carriage of the family."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What!" cried Julia:&nbsp; "go boxed up three in a postchaise

<P>in this weather, when we may have seats in a barouche!

<P>No, my dear Edmund, that will not quite do."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Besides," said Maria, "I know that Mr. Crawford depends

<P>upon taking us.&nbsp; After what passed at first, he would

<P>claim it as a promise."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And, my dear Edmund," added Mrs. Norris, "taking out _two_

<P>carriages when _one_ will do, would be trouble for nothing;

<P>and, between ourselves, coachman is not very fond of the

<P>roads between this and Sotherton:&nbsp; he always complains

<P>bitterly of the narrow lanes scratching his carriage,

<P>and you know one should not like to have dear Sir Thomas,

<P>when he comes home, find all the varnish scratched off."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That would not be a very handsome reason for using

<P>Mr. Crawford's," said Maria; "but the truth is, that Wilcox

<P>is a stupid old fellow, and does not know how to drive.

<P>I will answer for it that we shall find no inconvenience

<P>from narrow roads on Wednesday."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There is no hardship, I suppose, nothing unpleasant,"

<P>said Edmund, "in going on the barouche box."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Unpleasant!" cried Maria:&nbsp; "oh dear!&nbsp; I believe it would

<P>be generally thought the favourite seat.&nbsp; There can

<P>be no comparison as to one's view of the country.

<P>Probably Miss Crawford will choose the barouche-box herself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There can be no objection, then, to Fanny's going with you;

<P>there can be no doubt of your having room for her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Fanny!" repeated Mrs. Norris; "my dear Edmund, there is

<P>no idea of her going with us.&nbsp; She stays with her aunt.

<P>I told Mrs. Rushworth so.&nbsp; She is not expected."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You can have no reason, I imagine, madam," said he,

<P>addressing his mother, "for wishing Fanny _not_

<P>to be of the party, but as it relates to yourself,

<P>to your own comfort.&nbsp; If you could do without her,

<P>you would not wish to keep her at home?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"To be sure not, but I _cannot_ do without her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You can, if I stay at home with you, as I mean to do."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was a general cry out at this.&nbsp; "Yes," he continued,

<P>"there is no necessity for my going, and I mean to stay

<P>at home.&nbsp; Fanny has a great desire to see Sotherton.

<P>I know she wishes it very much.&nbsp; She has not often a

<P>gratification of the kind, and I am sure, ma'am, you would

<P>be glad to give her the pleasure now?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh yes! very glad, if your aunt sees no objection."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Norris was very ready with the only objection which

<P>could remain--their having positively assured Mrs. Rushworth

<P>that Fanny could not go, and the very strange appearance

<P>there would consequently be in taking her, which seemed

<P>to her a difficulty quite impossible to be got over.

<P>It must have the strangest appearance!&nbsp; It would be

<P>something so very unceremonious, so bordering on disrespect

<P>for Mrs. Rushworth, whose own manners were such a pattern

<P>of good-breeding and attention, that she really did not

<P>feel equal to it.&nbsp; Mrs. Norris had no affection for Fanny,

<P>and no wish of procuring her pleasure at any time;

<P>but her opposition to Edmund _now_, arose more from

<P>partiality for her own scheme, because it _was_ her own,

<P>than from anything else.&nbsp; She felt that she had arranged

<P>everything extremely well, and that any alteration must be

<P>for the worse.&nbsp; When Edmund, therefore, told her in reply,

<P>as he did when she would give him the hearing, that she

<P>need not distress herself on Mrs. Rushworth's account,

<P>because he had taken the opportunity, as he walked with

<P>her through the hall, of mentioning Miss Price as one

<P>who would probably be of the party, and had directly

<P>received a very sufficient invitation for his cousin,

<P>Mrs. Norris was too much vexed to submit with a very

<P>good grace, and would only say, "Very well, very well,

<P>just as you chuse, settle it your own way, I am sure I

<P>do not care about it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It seems very odd," said Maria, "that you should be

<P>staying at home instead of Fanny."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am sure she ought to be very much obliged to you,"

<P>added Julia, hastily leaving the room as she spoke,

<P>from a consciousness that she ought to offer to stay at

<P>home herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Fanny will feel quite as grateful as the occasion requires,"

<P>was Edmund's only reply, and the subject dropt.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny's gratitude, when she heard the plan, was, in fact,

<P>much greater than her pleasure.&nbsp; She felt Edmund's kindness

<P>with all, and more than all, the sensibility which he,

<P>unsuspicious of her fond attachment, could be aware of;

<P>but that he should forego any enjoyment on her account gave

<P>her pain, and her own satisfaction in seeing Sotherton would

<P>be nothing without him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The next meeting of the two Mansfield families produced

<P>another alteration in the plan, and one that was admitted

<P>with general approbation.&nbsp; Mrs. Grant offered herself as

<P>companion for the day to Lady Bertram in lieu of her son,

<P>and Dr. Grant was to join them at dinner.&nbsp; Lady Bertram

<P>was very well pleased to have it so, and the young ladies

<P>were in spirits again.&nbsp; Even Edmund was very thankful for an

<P>arrangement which restored him to his share of the party;

<P>and Mrs. Norris thought it an excellent plan, and had it

<P>at her tongue's end, and was on the point of proposing it,

<P>when Mrs. Grant spoke.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Wednesday was fine, and soon after breakfast the barouche

<P>arrived, Mr. Crawford driving his sisters; and as everybody

<P>was ready, there was nothing to be done but for Mrs. Grant

<P>to alight and the others to take their places.&nbsp; The place

<P>of all places, the envied seat, the post of honour,

<P>was unappropriated.&nbsp; To whose happy lot was it to fall?

<P>While each of the Miss Bertrams were meditating how best,

<P>and with the most appearance of obliging the others,

<P>to secure it, the matter was settled by Mrs. Grant's saying,

<P>as she stepped from the carriage, "As there are five

<P>of you, it will be better that one should sit with Henry;

<P>and as you were saying lately that you wished you

<P>could drive, Julia, I think this will be a good opportunity

<P>for you to take a lesson."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Happy Julia!&nbsp; Unhappy Maria!&nbsp; The former was on the

<P>barouche-box in a moment, the latter took her seat within,

<P>in gloom and mortification; and the carriage drove

<P>off amid the good wishes of the two remaining ladies,

<P>and the barking of Pug in his mistress's arms.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Their road was through a pleasant country; and Fanny,

<P>whose rides had never been extensive, was soon beyond

<P>her knowledge, and was very happy in observing all that

<P>was new, and admiring all that was pretty.&nbsp; She was not

<P>often invited to join in the conversation of the others,

<P>nor did she desire it.&nbsp; Her own thoughts and reflections

<P>were habitually her best companions; and, in observing

<P>the appearance of the country, the bearings of the roads,

<P>the difference of soil, the state of the harvest, the cottages,

<P>the cattle, the children, she found entertainment

<P>that could only have been heightened by having Edmund

<P>to speak to of what she felt.&nbsp; That was the only point

<P>of resemblance between her and the lady who sat by her:

<P>in everything but a value for Edmund, Miss Crawford was

<P>very unlike her.&nbsp; She had none of Fanny's delicacy of taste,

<P>of mind, of feeling; she saw Nature, inanimate Nature,

<P>with little observation; her attention was all for men

<P>and women, her talents for the light and lively.

<P>In looking back after Edmund, however, when there was

<P>any stretch of road behind them, or when he gained on

<P>them in ascending a considerable hill, they were united,

<P>and a "there he is" broke at the same moment from them both,

<P>more than once.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For the first seven miles Miss Bertram had very little

<P>real comfort:&nbsp; her prospect always ended in Mr. Crawford

<P>and her sister sitting side by side, full of conversation

<P>and merriment; and to see only his expressive profile

<P>as he turned with a smile to Julia, or to catch the laugh

<P>of the other, was a perpetual source of irritation,

<P>which her own sense of propriety could but just smooth over.

<P>When Julia looked back, it was with a countenance of delight,

<P>and whenever she spoke to them, it was in the highest spirits:

<P>"her view of the country was charming, she wished they

<P>could all see it," etc.; but her only offer of exchange

<P>was addressed to Miss Crawford, as they gained the summit

<P>of a long hill, and was not more inviting than this:

<P>"Here is a fine burst of country.&nbsp; I wish you had my seat,

<P>but I dare say you will not take it, let me press you ever

<P>so much;" and Miss Crawford could hardly answer before they

<P>were moving again at a good pace.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When they came within the influence of Sotherton associations,

<P>it was better for Miss Bertram, who might be said to have

<P>two strings to her bow.&nbsp; She had Rushworth feelings,

<P>and Crawford feelings, and in the vicinity of Sotherton

<P>the former had considerable effect.&nbsp; Mr. Rushworth's

<P>consequence was hers.&nbsp; She could not tell Miss Crawford

<P>that "those woods belonged to Sotherton," she could not

<P>carelessly observe that "she believed that it was now

<P>all Mr. Rushworth's property on each side of the road,"

<P>without elation of heart; and it was a pleasure to increase

<P>with their approach to the capital freehold mansion,

<P>and ancient manorial residence of the family, with all

<P>its rights of court-leet and court-baron.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now we shall have no more rough road, Miss Crawford;

<P>our difficulties are over.&nbsp; The rest of the way is such

<P>as it ought to be.&nbsp; Mr. Rushworth has made it since he

<P>succeeded to the estate.&nbsp; Here begins the village.

<P>Those cottages are really a disgrace.&nbsp; The church spire

<P>is reckoned remarkably handsome.&nbsp; I am glad the church

<P>is not so close to the great house as often happens in

<P>old places.&nbsp; The annoyance of the bells must be terrible.

<P>There is the parsonage:&nbsp; a tidy-looking house, and I

<P>understand the clergyman and his wife are very decent people.

<P>Those are almshouses, built by some of the family.

<P>To the right is the steward's house; he is a very

<P>respectable man.&nbsp; Now we are coming to the lodge-gates;

<P>but we have nearly a mile through the park still.

<P>It is not ugly, you see, at this end; there is some

<P>fine timber, but the situation of the house is dreadful.

<P>We go down hill to it for half a mile, and it is a pity,

<P>for it would not be an ill-looking place if it had a

<P>better approach."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Miss Crawford was not slow to admire; she pretty well guessed

<P>Miss Bertram's feelings, and made it a point of honour

<P>to promote her enjoyment to the utmost.&nbsp; Mrs. Norris was

<P>all delight and volubility; and even Fanny had something

<P>to say in admiration, and might be heard with complacency.

<P>Her eye was eagerly taking in everything within her reach;

<P>and after being at some pains to get a view of the house,

<P>and observing that "it was a sort of building which she

<P>could not look at but with respect," she added, "Now, where

<P>is the avenue?&nbsp; The house fronts the east, I perceive.

<P>The avenue, therefore, must be at the back of it.

<P>Mr. Rushworth talked of the west front."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, it is exactly behind the house; begins at a little

<P>distance, and ascends for half a mile to the extremity

<P>of the grounds.&nbsp; You may see something of it here--

<P>something of the more distant trees.&nbsp; It is oak entirely."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Miss Bertram could now speak with decided information

<P>of what she had known nothing about when Mr. Rushworth

<P>had asked her opinion; and her spirits were in as happy

<P>a flutter as vanity and pride could furnish, when they drove

<P>up to the spacious stone steps before the principal entrance.
