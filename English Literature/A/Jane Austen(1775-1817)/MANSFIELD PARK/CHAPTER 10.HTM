<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A quarter of an hour, twenty minutes, passed away,

<P>and Fanny was still thinking of Edmund, Miss Crawford,

<P>and herself, without interruption from any one.&nbsp; She began

<P>to be surprised at being left so long, and to listen

<P>with an anxious desire of hearing their steps and their

<P>voices again.&nbsp; She listened, and at length she heard;

<P>she heard voices and feet approaching; but she had just

<P>satisfied herself that it was not those she wanted,

<P>when Miss Bertram, Mr. Rushworth, and Mr. Crawford issued

<P>from the same path which she had trod herself, and were

<P>before her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Miss Price all alone" and "My dear Fanny, how comes this?"

<P>were the first salutations.&nbsp; She told her story.

<P>"Poor dear Fanny," cried her cousin, "how ill you have been

<P>used by them!&nbsp; You had better have staid with us."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Then seating herself with a gentleman on each side,

<P>she resumed the conversation which had engaged them before,

<P>and discussed the possibility of improvements with

<P>much animation.&nbsp; Nothing was fixed on; but Henry Crawford

<P>was full of ideas and projects, and, generally speaking,

<P>whatever he proposed was immediately approved, first by her,

<P>and then by Mr. Rushworth, whose principal business

<P>seemed to be to hear the others, and who scarcely risked

<P>an original thought of his own beyond a wish that they

<P>had seen his friend Smith's place.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After some minutes spent in this way, Miss Bertram,

<P>observing the iron gate, expressed a wish of passing

<P>through it into the park, that their views and their

<P>plans might be more comprehensive.&nbsp; It was the very thing

<P>of all others to be wished, it was the best, it was

<P>the only way of proceeding with any advantage, in Henry

<P>Crawford's opinion; and he directly saw a knoll not half

<P>a mile off, which would give them exactly the requisite

<P>command of the house.&nbsp; Go therefore they must to that knoll,

<P>and through that gate; but the gate was locked.

<P>Mr. Rushworth wished he had brought the key; he had been

<P>very near thinking whether he should not bring the key;

<P>he was determined he would never come without the key again;

<P>but still this did not remove the present evil.&nbsp; They could

<P>not get through; and as Miss Bertram's inclination for so

<P>doing did by no means lessen, it ended in Mr. Rushworth's

<P>declaring outright that he would go and fetch the key.

<P>He set off accordingly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is undoubtedly the best thing we can do now, as we

<P>are so far from the house already," said Mr. Crawford,

<P>when he was gone.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, there is nothing else to be done.&nbsp; But now, sincerely,

<P>do not you find the place altogether worse than you expected?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, indeed, far otherwise.&nbsp; I find it better, grander, more

<P>complete in its style, though that style may not be the best.

<P>And to tell you the truth," speaking rather lower, "I do not

<P>think that _I_ shall ever see Sotherton again with so much

<P>pleasure as I do now.&nbsp; Another summer will hardly improve it to

<P>me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After a moment's embarrassment the lady replied, "You are

<P>too much a man of the world not to see with the eyes

<P>of the world.&nbsp; If other people think Sotherton improved,

<P>I have no doubt that you will."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am afraid I am not quite so much the man of the world

<P>as might be good for me in some points.&nbsp; My feelings

<P>are not quite so evanescent, nor my memory of the past

<P>under such easy dominion as one finds to be the case

<P>with men of the world."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This was followed by a short silence.&nbsp; Miss Bertram

<P>began again.&nbsp; "You seemed to enjoy your drive here very much

<P>this morning.&nbsp; I was glad to see you so well entertained.

<P>You and Julia were laughing the whole way."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Were we?&nbsp; Yes, I believe we were; but I have not

<P>the least recollection at what.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; I believe

<P>I was relating to her some ridiculous stories

<P>of an old Irish groom of my uncle's. Your sister loves to laugh."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You think her more light-hearted than I am?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"More easily amused," he replied; "consequently, you know,"

<P>smiling, "better company.&nbsp; I could not have hoped

<P>to entertain you with Irish anecdotes during a ten miles' drive."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Naturally, I believe, I am as lively as Julia, but I

<P>have more to think of now."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You have, undoubtedly; and there are situations in

<P>which very high spirits would denote insensibility.

<P>Your prospects, however, are too fair to justify want

<P>of spirits.&nbsp; You have a very smiling scene before you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do you mean literally or figuratively?&nbsp; Literally,

<P>I conclude.&nbsp; Yes, certainly, the sun shines, and the park

<P>looks very cheerful.&nbsp; But unluckily that iron gate,

<P>that ha-ha, give me a feeling of restraint and hardship.

<P>"I cannot get out, as the starling said."&nbsp; As she spoke,

<P>and it was with expression, she walked to the gate:

<P>he followed her.&nbsp; "Mr. Rushworth is so long fetching

<P>this key!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And for the world you would not get out without the key

<P>and without Mr. Rushworth's authority and protection,

<P>or I think you might with little difficulty pass round

<P>the edge of the gate, here, with my assistance; I think it

<P>might be done, if you really wished to be more at large,

<P>and could allow yourself to think it not prohibited."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Prohibited! nonsense!&nbsp; I certainly can get out that way,

<P>and I will.&nbsp; Mr. Rushworth will be here in a moment,

<P>you know; we shall not be out of sight."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Or if we are, Miss Price will be so good as to tell him

<P>that he will find us near that knoll:&nbsp; the grove of oak

<P>on the knoll."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny, feeling all this to be wrong, could not help

<P>making an effort to prevent it.&nbsp; "You will hurt yourself,

<P>Miss Bertram," she cried; "you will certainly hurt

<P>yourself against those spikes; you will tear your gown;

<P>you will be in danger of slipping into the ha-ha. You had

<P>better not go."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her cousin was safe on the other side while these words

<P>were spoken, and, smiling with all the good-humour

<P>of success, she said, "Thank you, my dear Fanny,

<P>but I and my gown are alive and well, and so good-bye."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny was again left to her solitude, and with no increase

<P>of pleasant feelings, for she was sorry for almost all

<P>that she had seen and heard, astonished at Miss Bertram,

<P>and angry with Mr. Crawford.&nbsp; By taking a circuitous

<P>route, and, as it appeared to her, very unreasonable

<P>direction to the knoll, they were soon beyond her eye;

<P>and for some minutes longer she remained without sight

<P>or sound of any companion.&nbsp; She seemed to have the little

<P>wood all to herself.&nbsp; She could almost have thought

<P>that Edmund and Miss Crawford had left it, but that

<P>it was impossible for Edmund to forget her so entirely.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was again roused from disagreeable musings by sudden footsteps:
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>somebody was coming at a quick pace down the principal walk.

<P>She expected Mr. Rushworth, but it was Julia, who,

<P>hot and out of breath, and with a look of disappointment,

<P>cried out on seeing her, "Heyday!&nbsp; Where are the others?

<P>I thought Maria and Mr. Crawford were with you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny explained.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A pretty trick, upon my word!&nbsp; I cannot see them anywhere,"

<P>looking eagerly into the park.&nbsp; "But they cannot be very

<P>far off, and I think I am equal to as much as Maria,

<P>even without help."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But, Julia, Mr. Rushworth will be here in a moment

<P>with the key.&nbsp; Do wait for Mr. Rushworth."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not I, indeed.&nbsp; I have had enough of the family for

<P>one morning.&nbsp; Why, child, I have but this moment escaped from

<P>his horrible mother.&nbsp; Such a penance as I have been enduring,

<P>while you were sitting here so composed and so happy!

<P>It might have been as well, perhaps, if you had been in

<P>my place, but you always contrive to keep out of these scrapes."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This was a most unjust reflection, but Fanny could allow

<P>for it, and let it pass:&nbsp; Julia was vexed, and her

<P>temper was hasty; but she felt that it would not last,

<P>and therefore, taking no notice, only asked her if she

<P>had not seen Mr. Rushworth.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, yes, we saw him.&nbsp; He was posting away as if upon

<P>life and death, and could but just spare time to tell us

<P>his errand, and where you all were."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is a pity he should have so much trouble for nothing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"_That_ is Miss Maria's concern.&nbsp; I am not obliged

<P>to punish myself for _her_ sins.&nbsp; The mother I could

<P>not avoid, as long as my tiresome aunt was dancing about

<P>with the housekeeper, but the son I _can_ get away from."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And she immediately scrambled across the fence,

<P>and walked away, not attending to Fanny's last question of

<P>whether she had seen anything of Miss Crawford and Edmund.

<P>The sort of dread in which Fanny now sat of seeing

<P>Mr. Rushworth prevented her thinking so much of their

<P>continued absence, however, as she might have done.

<P>She felt that he had been very ill-used, and was quite

<P>unhappy in having to communicate what had passed.

<P>He joined her within five minutes after Julia's exit;

<P>and though she made the best of the story, he was evidently

<P>mortified and displeased in no common degree.&nbsp; At first

<P>he scarcely said anything; his looks only expressed his

<P>extreme surprise and vexation, and he walked to the gate

<P>and stood there, without seeming to know what to do.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"They desired me to stay--my cousin Maria charged me to say

<P>that you would find them at that knoll, or thereabouts."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not believe I shall go any farther," said he sullenly;

<P>"I see nothing of them.&nbsp; By the time I get to the knoll they

<P>may be gone somewhere else.&nbsp; I have had walking enough."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And he sat down with a most gloomy countenance by Fanny.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am very sorry," said she; "it is very unlucky."&nbsp; And she

<P>longed to be able to say something more to the purpose.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After an interval of silence, "I think they might as well

<P>have staid for me," said he.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Miss Bertram thought you would follow her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I should not have had to follow her if she had staid."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This could not be denied, and Fanny was silenced.

<P>After another pause, he went on--"Pray, Miss Price,

<P>are you such a great admirer of this Mr. Crawford as some

<P>people are?&nbsp; For my part, I can see nothing in him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not think him at all handsome."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Handsome!&nbsp; Nobody can call such an undersized man handsome.

<P>He is not five foot nine.&nbsp; I should not wonder if he is not more

<P>than five foot eight.&nbsp; I think he is an ill-looking fellow.

<P>In my opinion, these Crawfords are no addition at all.

<P>We did very well without them."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A small sigh escaped Fanny here, and she did not know

<P>how to contradict him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If I had made any difficulty about fetching the key,

<P>there might have been some excuse, but I went the very

<P>moment she said she wanted it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nothing could be more obliging than your manner, I am sure,

<P>and I dare say you walked as fast as you could; but still

<P>it is some distance, you know, from this spot to the house,

<P>quite into the house; and when people are waiting,

<P>they are bad judges of time, and every half minute seems

<P>like five."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He got up and walked to the gate again, and "wished he

<P>had had the key about him at the time."&nbsp; Fanny thought she

<P>discerned in his standing there an indication of relenting,

<P>which encouraged her to another attempt, and she said,

<P>therefore, "It is a pity you should not join them.

<P>They expected to have a better view of the house from

<P>that part of the park, and will be thinking how it

<P>may be improved; and nothing of that sort, you know,

<P>can be settled without you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She found herself more successful in sending away than

<P>in retaining a companion.&nbsp; Mr. Rushworth was worked on.

<P>"Well," said he, "if you really think I had better go:

<P>it would be foolish to bring the key for nothing."

<P>And letting himself out, he walked off without farther

<P>ceremony.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny's thoughts were now all engrossed by the two who

<P>had left her so long ago, and getting quite impatient,

<P>she resolved to go in search of them.&nbsp; She followed

<P>their steps along the bottom walk, and had just turned

<P>up into another, when the voice and the laugh of Miss

<P>Crawford once more caught her ear; the sound approached,

<P>and a few more windings brought them before her.

<P>They were just returned into the wilderness from the park,

<P>to which a sidegate, not fastened, had tempted them very

<P>soon after their leaving her, and they had been across

<P>a portion of the park into the very avenue which Fanny

<P>had been hoping the whole morning to reach at last,

<P>and had been sitting down under one of the trees.

<P>This was their history.&nbsp; It was evident that they had been

<P>spending their time pleasantly, and were not aware of the

<P>length of their absence.&nbsp; Fanny's best consolation was

<P>in being assured that Edmund had wished for her very much,

<P>and that he should certainly have come back for her,

<P>had she not been tired already; but this was not quite

<P>sufficient to do away with the pain of having been left

<P>a whole hour, when he had talked of only a few minutes,

<P>nor to banish the sort of curiosity she felt to know

<P>what they had been conversing about all that time;

<P>and the result of the whole was to her disappointment

<P>and depression, as they prepared by general agreement to

<P>return to the house.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>On reaching the bottom of the steps to the terrace,

<P>Mrs. Rushworth and Mrs. Norris presented themselves

<P>at the top, just ready for the wilderness, at the end

<P>of an hour and a half from their leaving the house.

<P>Mrs. Norris had been too well employed to move faster.

<P>Whatever cross-accidents had occurred to intercept the pleasures

<P>of her nieces, she had found a morning of complete enjoyment;

<P>for the housekeeper, after a great many courtesies on

<P>the subject of pheasants, had taken her to the dairy,

<P>told her all about their cows, and given her the receipt

<P>for a famous cream cheese; and since Julia's leaving them

<P>they had been met by the gardener, with whom she had made

<P>a most satisfactory acquaintance, for she had set him

<P>right as to his grandson's illness, convinced him that it

<P>was an ague, and promised him a charm for it; and he,

<P>in return, had shewn her all his choicest nursery of plants,

<P>and actually presented her with a very curious specimen

<P>of heath.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>On this _ rencontre_ they all returned to the house together,

<P>there to lounge away the time as they could with sofas,

<P>and chit-chat, and Quarterly Reviews, till the return

<P>of the others, and the arrival of dinner.&nbsp; It was late

<P>before the Miss Bertrams and the two gentlemen came in,

<P>and their ramble did not appear to have been more than

<P>partially agreeable, or at all productive of anything

<P>useful with regard to the object of the day.&nbsp; By their

<P>own accounts they had been all walking after each other,

<P>and the junction which had taken place at last seemed,

<P>to Fanny's observation, to have been as much too late

<P>for re-establishing harmony, as it confessedly had

<P>been for determining on any alteration.&nbsp; She felt,

<P>as she looked at Julia and Mr. Rushworth, that hers

<P>was not the only dissatisfied bosom amongst them:

<P>there was gloom on the face of each.&nbsp; Mr. Crawford

<P>and Miss Bertram were much more gay, and she thought

<P>that he was taking particular pains, during dinner,

<P>to do away any little resentment of the other two,

<P>and restore general good-humour.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Dinner was soon followed by tea and coffee, a ten miles'

<P>drive home allowed no waste of hours; and from the time

<P>of their sitting down to table, it was a quick succession

<P>of busy nothings till the carriage came to the door,

<P>and Mrs. Norris, having fidgeted about, and obtained a

<P>few pheasants' eggs and a cream cheese from the housekeeper,

<P>and made abundance of civil speeches to Mrs. Rushworth,

<P>was ready to lead the way.&nbsp; At the same moment Mr. Crawford,

<P>approaching Julia, said, "I hope I am not to lose

<P>my companion, unless she is afraid of the evening air

<P>in so exposed a seat."&nbsp; The request had not been foreseen,

<P>but was very graciously received, and Julia's day was

<P>likely to end almost as well as it began.&nbsp; Miss Bertram

<P>had made up her mind to something different, and was a

<P>little disappointed; but her conviction of being really

<P>the one preferred comforted her under it, and enabled her

<P>to receive Mr. Rushworth's parting attentions as she ought.

<P>He was certainly better pleased to hand her into

<P>the barouche than to assist her in ascending the box,

<P>and his complacency seemed confirmed by the arrangement.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, Fanny, this has been a fine day for you, upon my word,"

<P>said Mrs. Norris, as they drove through the park.

<P>"Nothing but pleasure from beginning to end!&nbsp; I am sure

<P>you ought to be very much obliged to your aunt Bertram

<P>and me for contriving to let you go.&nbsp; A pretty good day's

<P>amusement you have had!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Maria was just discontented enough to say directly, "I think

<P>_you_ have done pretty well yourself, ma'am. Your lap seems

<P>full of good things, and here is a basket of something

<P>between us which has been knocking my elbow unmercifully."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear, it is only a beautiful little heath,

<P>which that nice old gardener would make me take; but if

<P>it is in your way, I will have it in my lap directly.

<P>There, Fanny, you shall carry that parcel for me;

<P>take great care of it:&nbsp; do not let it fall; it is a

<P>cream cheese, just like the excellent one we had at dinner.

<P>Nothing would satisfy that good old Mrs. Whitaker,

<P>but my taking one of the cheeses.&nbsp; I stood out as long

<P>as I could, till the tears almost came into her eyes,

<P>and I knew it was just the sort that my sister would

<P>be delighted with.&nbsp; That Mrs. Whitaker is a treasure!

<P>She was quite shocked when I asked her whether wine was allowed

<P>at the second table, and she has turned away two housemaids

<P>for wearing white gowns.&nbsp; Take care of the cheese, Fanny.

<P>Now I can manage the other parcel and the basket very well."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What else have you been spunging?" said Maria,

<P>half-pleased that Sotherton should be so complimented.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Spunging, my dear!&nbsp; It is nothing but four of those

<P>beautiful pheasants' eggs, which Mrs. Whitaker would

<P>quite force upon me:&nbsp; she would not take a denial.

<P>She said it must be such an amusement to me, as she

<P>understood I lived quite alone, to have a few living

<P>creatures of that sort; and so to be sure it will.

<P>I shall get the dairymaid to set them under the first

<P>spare hen, and if they come to good I can have them moved

<P>to my own house and borrow a coop; and it will be a great

<P>delight to me in my lonely hours to attend to them.

<P>And if I have good luck, your mother shall have some."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was a beautiful evening, mild and still, and the

<P>drive was as pleasant as the serenity of Nature

<P>could make it; but when Mrs. Norris ceased speaking,

<P>it was altogether a silent drive to those within.

<P>Their spirits were in general exhausted; and to determine

<P>whether the day had afforded most pleasure or pain,

<P>might occupy the meditations of almost all.
