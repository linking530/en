<P>Edmund's first object the next morning was to see his

<P>father alone, and give him a fair statement of the whole

<P>acting scheme, defending his own share in it as far only

<P>as he could then, in a soberer moment, feel his motives

<P>to deserve, and acknowledging, with perfect ingenuousness,

<P>that his concession had been attended with such partial

<P>good as to make his judgment in it very doubtful.

<P>He was anxious, while vindicating himself, to say nothing

<P>unkind of the others:&nbsp; but there was only one amongst them

<P>whose conduct he could mention without some necessity

<P>of defence or palliation.&nbsp; "We have all been more or less

<P>to blame," said he, "every one of us, excepting Fanny.

<P>Fanny is the only one who has judged rightly throughout;

<P>who has been consistent.&nbsp; _Her_ feelings have been steadily

<P>against it from first to last.&nbsp; She never ceased to think

<P>of what was due to you.&nbsp; You will find Fanny everything you

<P>could wish."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sir Thomas saw all the impropriety of such a scheme among

<P>such a party, and at such a time, as strongly as his son

<P>had ever supposed he must; he felt it too much, indeed,

<P>for many words; and having shaken hands with Edmund,

<P>meant to try to lose the disagreeable impression,

<P>and forget how much he had been forgotten himself as soon

<P>as he could, after the house had been cleared of every

<P>object enforcing the remembrance, and restored to its

<P>proper state.&nbsp; He did not enter into any remonstrance with

<P>his other children:&nbsp; he was more willing to believe they

<P>felt their error than to run the risk of investigation.

<P>The reproof of an immediate conclusion of everything,

<P>the sweep of every preparation, would be sufficient.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was one person, however, in the house, whom he could

<P>not leave to learn his sentiments merely through his conduct.

<P>He could not help giving Mrs. Norris a hint of his having

<P>hoped that her advice might have been interposed to prevent

<P>what her judgment must certainly have disapproved.&nbsp; The young

<P>people had been very inconsiderate in forming the plan;

<P>they ought to have been capable of a better decision themselves;

<P>but they were young; and, excepting Edmund, he believed,

<P>of unsteady characters; and with greater surprise, therefore,

<P>he must regard her acquiescence in their wrong measures,

<P>her countenance of their unsafe amusements, than that such

<P>measures and such amusements should have been suggested.

<P>Mrs. Norris was a little confounded and as nearly being

<P>silenced as ever she had been in her life; for she

<P>was ashamed to confess having never seen any of the

<P>impropriety which was so glaring to Sir Thomas, and would

<P>not have admitted that her influence was insufficient--

<P>that she might have talked in vain.&nbsp; Her only resource

<P>was to get out of the subject as fast as possible, and turn

<P>the current of Sir Thomas's ideas into a happier channel.

<P>She had a great deal to insinuate in her own praise

<P>as to _general_ attention to the interest and comfort

<P>of his family, much exertion and many sacrifices to glance

<P>at in the form of hurried walks and sudden removals from

<P>her own fireside, and many excellent hints of distrust

<P>and economy to Lady Bertram and Edmund to detail,

<P>whereby a most considerable saving had always arisen,

<P>and more than one bad servant been detected.&nbsp; But her chief

<P>strength lay in Sotherton.&nbsp; Her greatest support and glory

<P>was in having formed the connexion with the Rushworths.

<P>_There_ she was impregnable.&nbsp; She took to herself all

<P>the credit of bringing Mr. Rushworth's admiration of Maria

<P>to any effect.&nbsp; "If I had not been active," said she,

<P>"and made a point of being introduced to his mother,

<P>and then prevailed on my sister to pay the first visit,

<P>I am as certain as I sit here that nothing would have

<P>come of it; for Mr. Rushworth is the sort of amiable

<P>modest young man who wants a great deal of encouragement,

<P>and there were girls enough on the catch for him if we

<P>had been idle.&nbsp; But I left no stone unturned.&nbsp; I was

<P>ready to move heaven and earth to persuade my sister,

<P>and at last I did persuade her.&nbsp; You know the distance

<P>to Sotherton; it was in the middle of winter, and the roads

<P>almost impassable, but I did persuade her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I know how great, how justly great, your influence

<P>is with Lady Bertram and her children, and am the more

<P>concerned that it should not have been."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear Sir Thomas, if you had seen the state of the

<P>roads _that_ day!&nbsp; I thought we should never have got

<P>through them, though we had the four horses of course;

<P>and poor old coachman would attend us, out of his great love

<P>and kindness, though he was hardly able to sit the box

<P>on account of the rheumatism which I had been doctoring

<P>him for ever since Michaelmas.&nbsp; I cured him at last;

<P>but he was very bad all the winter--and this was such a day,

<P>I could not help going to him up in his room before we set

<P>off to advise him not to venture:&nbsp; he was putting on his wig;

<P>so I said, 'Coachman, you had much better not go; your Lady

<P>and I shall be very safe; you know how steady Stephen is,

<P>and Charles has been upon the leaders so often now,

<P>that I am sure there is no fear.'&nbsp; But, however, I soon

<P>found it would not do; he was bent upon going, and as I

<P>hate to be worrying and officious, I said no more; but my

<P>heart quite ached for him at every jolt, and when we got

<P>into the rough lanes about Stoke, where, what with frost

<P>and snow upon beds of stones, it was worse than anything

<P>you can imagine, I was quite in an agony about him.

<P>And then the poor horses too!&nbsp; To see them straining away!

<P>You know how I always feel for the horses.&nbsp; And when we got

<P>to the bottom of Sandcroft Hill, what do you think I did?

<P>You will laugh at me; but I got out and walked up.

<P>I did indeed.&nbsp; It might not be saving them much, but it

<P>was something, and I could not bear to sit at my ease

<P>and be dragged up at the expense of those noble animals.

<P>I caught a dreadful cold, but _that_ I did not regard.

<P>My object was accomplished in the visit."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I hope we shall always think the acquaintance worth

<P>any trouble that might be taken to establish it.

<P>There is nothing very striking in Mr. Rushworth's manners,

<P>but I was pleased last night with what appeared to be his

<P>opinion on one subject:&nbsp; his decided preference of a quiet

<P>family party to the bustle and confusion of acting.

<P>He seemed to feel exactly as one could wish."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, indeed, and the more you know of him the better

<P>you will like him.&nbsp; He is not a shining character,

<P>but he has a thousand good qualities; and is so disposed

<P>to look up to you, that I am quite laughed at about it,

<P>for everybody considers it as my doing.&nbsp; 'Upon my word,

<P>Mrs. Norris,' said Mrs. Grant the other day, 'if Mr. Rushworth

<P>were a son of your own, he could not hold Sir Thomas

<P>in greater respect.'"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sir Thomas gave up the point, foiled by her evasions,

<P>disarmed by her flattery; and was obliged to rest

<P>satisfied with the conviction that where the present

<P>pleasure of those she loved was at stake, her kindness

<P>did sometimes overpower her judgment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was a busy morning with him.&nbsp; Conversation with any

<P>of them occupied but a small part of it.&nbsp; He had to

<P>reinstate himself in all the wonted concerns of his

<P>Mansfield life:&nbsp; to see his steward and his bailiff;

<P>to examine and compute, and, in the intervals

<P>of business, to walk into his stables and his gardens,

<P>and nearest plantations; but active and methodical,

<P>he had not only done all this before he resumed his seat

<P>as master of the house at dinner, he had also set the

<P>carpenter to work in pulling down what had been so lately

<P>put up in the billiard-room, and given the scene-painter

<P>his dismissal long enough to justify the pleasing belief

<P>of his being then at least as far off as Northampton.

<P>The scene-painter was gone, having spoilt only the

<P>floor of one room, ruined all the coachman's sponges,

<P>and made five of the under-servants idle and dissatisfied;

<P>and Sir Thomas was in hopes that another day or two would

<P>suffice to wipe away every outward memento of what had been,

<P>even to the destruction of every unbound copy of Lovers'

<P>Vows in the house, for he was burning all that met his eye
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Yates was beginning now to understand Sir Thomas's intentions,

<P>though as far as ever from understanding their source.

<P>He and his friend had been out with their guns the chief of

<P>the morning, and Tom had taken the opportunity of explaining,

<P>with proper apologies for his father's particularity,

<P>what was to be expected.&nbsp; Mr. Yates felt it as acutely

<P>as might be supposed.&nbsp; To be a second time disappointed

<P>in the same way was an instance of very severe ill-luck;

<P>and his indignation was such, that had it not been for delicacy

<P>towards his friend, and his friend's youngest sister,

<P>he believed he should certainly attack the baronet on

<P>the absurdity of his proceedings, and argue him into a

<P>little more rationality.&nbsp; He believed this very stoutly

<P>while he was in Mansfield Wood, and all the way home;

<P>but there was a something in Sir Thomas, when they sat

<P>round the same table, which made Mr. Yates think it wiser

<P>to let him pursue his own way, and feel the folly of it

<P>without opposition.&nbsp; He had known many disagreeable

<P>fathers before, and often been struck with the inconveniences

<P>they occasioned, but never, in the whole course of his life,

<P>had he seen one of that class so unintelligibly moral,

<P>so infamously tyrannical as Sir Thomas.&nbsp; He was not a man

<P>to be endured but for his children's sake, and he might

<P>be thankful to his fair daughter Julia that Mr. Yates

<P>did yet mean to stay a few days longer under his roof.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The evening passed with external smoothness, though almost

<P>every mind was ruffled; and the music which Sir Thomas

<P>called for from his daughters helped to conceal the want

<P>of real harmony.&nbsp; Maria was in a good deal of agitation.

<P>It was of the utmost consequence to her that Crawford

<P>should now lose no time in declaring himself, and she

<P>was disturbed that even a day should be gone by without

<P>seeming to advance that point.&nbsp; She had been expecting

<P>to see him the whole morning, and all the evening, too,

<P>was still expecting him.&nbsp; Mr. Rushworth had set off early

<P>with the great news for Sotherton; and she had fondly hoped

<P>for such an immediate _eclaircissement_ as might save him

<P>the trouble of ever coming back again.&nbsp; But they had seen

<P>no one from the Parsonage, not a creature, and had heard

<P>no tidings beyond a friendly note of congratulation

<P>and inquiry from Mrs. Grant to Lady Bertram.&nbsp; It was

<P>the first day for many, many weeks, in which the families

<P>had been wholly divided.&nbsp; Four-and-twenty hours had never

<P>passed before, since August began, without bringing them

<P>together in some way or other.&nbsp; It was a sad, anxious day;

<P>and the morrow, though differing in the sort of evil,

<P>did by no means bring less.&nbsp; A few moments of feverish

<P>enjoyment were followed by hours of acute suffering.

<P>Henry Crawford was again in the house:&nbsp; he walked up

<P>with Dr. Grant, who was anxious to pay his respects to

<P>Sir Thomas, and at rather an early hour they were ushered

<P>into the breakfast-room, where were most of the family.

<P>Sir Thomas soon appeared, and Maria saw with delight

<P>and agitation the introduction of the man she loved to

<P>her father.&nbsp; Her sensations were indefinable, and so were

<P>they a few minutes afterwards upon hearing Henry Crawford,

<P>who had a chair between herself and Tom, ask the latter

<P>in an undervoice whether there were any plans for resuming

<P>the play after the present happy interruption (with

<P>a courteous glance at Sir Thomas), because, in that case,

<P>he should make a point of returning to Mansfield at any time

<P>required by the party:&nbsp; he was going away immediately,

<P>being to meet his uncle at Bath without delay; but if there

<P>were any prospect of a renewal of Lovers' Vows, he should

<P>hold himself positively engaged, he should break through

<P>every other claim, he should absolutely condition with his

<P>uncle for attending them whenever he might be wanted.

<P>The play should not be lost by _his_ absence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"From Bath, Norfolk, London, York, wherever I may be,"

<P>said he; "I will attend you from any place in England,

<P>at an hour's notice."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was well at that moment that Tom had to speak, and not

<P>his sister.&nbsp; He could immediately say with easy fluency,

<P>"I am sorry you are going; but as to our play, _that_ is

<P>all over--entirely at an end" (looking significantly

<P>at his father). "The painter was sent off yesterday,

<P>and very little will remain of the theatre to-morrow. I knew

<P>how _that_ would be from the first.&nbsp; It is early for Bath.

<P>You will find nobody there."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is about my uncle's usual time."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"When do you think of going?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I may, perhaps, get as far as Banbury to-day."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Whose stables do you use at Bath?" was the next question;

<P>and while this branch of the subject was under discussion,

<P>Maria, who wanted neither pride nor resolution, was preparing

<P>to encounter her share of it with tolerable calmness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To her he soon turned, repeating much of what he had

<P>already said, with only a softened air and stronger

<P>expressions of regret.&nbsp; But what availed his expressions

<P>or his air?&nbsp; He was going, and, if not voluntarily going,

<P>voluntarily intending to stay away; for, excepting what might

<P>be due to his uncle, his engagements were all self-imposed.

<P>He might talk of necessity, but she knew his independence.

<P>The hand which had so pressed hers to his heart! the hand

<P>and the heart were alike motionless and passive now!

<P>Her spirit supported her, but the agony of her mind was severe.

<P>She had not long to endure what arose from listening

<P>to language which his actions contradicted, or to bury

<P>the tumult of her feelings under the restraint of society;

<P>for general civilities soon called his notice from her,

<P>and the farewell visit, as it then became openly acknowledged,

<P>was a very short one.&nbsp; He was gone--he had touched her

<P>hand for the last time, he had made his parting bow,

<P>and she might seek directly all that solitude could do

<P>for her.&nbsp; Henry Crawford was gone, gone from the house,

<P>and within two hours afterwards from the parish;

<P>and so ended all the hopes his selfish vanity had raised

<P>in Maria and Julia Bertram.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Julia could rejoice that he was gone.&nbsp; His presence was

<P>beginning to be odious to her; and if Maria gained him not,

<P>she was now cool enough to dispense with any other revenge.

<P>She did not want exposure to be added to desertion.

<P>Henry Crawford gone, she could even pity her sister.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With a purer spirit did Fanny rejoice in the intelligence.

<P>She heard it at dinner, and felt it a blessing.

<P>By all the others it was mentioned with regret;

<P>and his merits honoured with due gradation of feeling--

<P>from the sincerity of Edmund's too partial regard,

<P>to the unconcern of his mother speaking entirely by rote.

<P>Mrs. Norris began to look about her, and wonder that

<P>his falling in love with Julia had come to nothing;

<P>and could almost fear that she had been remiss herself

<P>in forwarding it; but with so many to care for, how was

<P>it possible for even _her_ activity to keep pace with

<P>her wishes?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Another day or two, and Mr. Yates was gone likewise.

<P>In _his_ departure Sir Thomas felt the chief interest:

<P>wanting to be alone with his family, the presence of a

<P>stranger superior to Mr. Yates must have been irksome;

<P>but of him, trifling and confident, idle and expensive,

<P>it was every way vexatious.&nbsp; In himself he was wearisome,

<P>but as the friend of Tom and the admirer of Julia he

<P>became offensive.&nbsp; Sir Thomas had been quite indifferent

<P>to Mr. Crawford's going or staying:&nbsp; but his good

<P>wishes for Mr. Yates's having a pleasant journey,

<P>as he walked with him to the hall-door, were given with

<P>genuine satisfaction.&nbsp; Mr. Yates had staid to see the

<P>destruction of every theatrical preparation at Mansfield,

<P>the removal of everything appertaining to the play:

<P>he left the house in all the soberness of its general

<P>character; and Sir Thomas hoped, in seeing him out of it,

<P>to be rid of the worst object connected with the scheme,

<P>and the last that must be inevitably reminding him of

<P>its existence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Norris contrived to remove one article from his sight

<P>that might have distressed him.&nbsp; The curtain, over which

<P>she had presided with such talent and such success,

<P>went off with her to her cottage, where she happened

<P>to be particularly in want of green baize.
