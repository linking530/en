<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sir Thomas was to return in November, and his eldest

<P>son had duties to call him earlier home.&nbsp; The approach

<P>of September brought tidings of Mr. Bertram, first in a

<P>letter to the gamekeeper and then in a letter to Edmund;

<P>and by the end of August he arrived himself, to be gay,

<P>agreeable, and gallant again as occasion served,

<P>or Miss Crawford demanded; to tell of races and Weymouth,

<P>and parties and friends, to which she might have listened

<P>six weeks before with some interest, and altogether

<P>to give her the fullest conviction, by the power

<P>of actual comparison, of her preferring his younger brother.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was very vexatious, and she was heartily sorry for it;

<P>but so it was; and so far from now meaning to marry

<P>the elder, she did not even want to attract him beyond

<P>what the simplest claims of conscious beauty required:

<P>his lengthened absence from Mansfield, without anything

<P>but pleasure in view, and his own will to consult, made it

<P>perfectly clear that he did not care about her; and his

<P>indifference was so much more than equalled by her own,

<P>that were he now to step forth the owner of Mansfield Park,

<P>the Sir Thomas complete, which he was to be in time, she did

<P>not believe she could accept him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The season and duties which brought Mr. Bertram back to

<P>Mansfield took Mr. Crawford into Norfolk.&nbsp; Everingham could

<P>not do without him in the beginning of September.&nbsp; He went

<P>for a fortnight--a fortnight of such dullness to the Miss

<P>Bertrams as ought to have put them both on their guard,

<P>and made even Julia admit, in her jealousy of her sister,

<P>the absolute necessity of distrusting his attentions,

<P>and wishing him not to return; and a fortnight of sufficient

<P>leisure, in the intervals of shooting and sleeping, to have

<P>convinced the gentleman that he ought to keep longer away,

<P>had he been more in the habit of examining his own motives,

<P>and of reflecting to what the indulgence of his idle vanity

<P>was tending; but, thoughtless and selfish from prosperity

<P>and bad example, he would not look beyond the present moment.

<P>The sisters, handsome, clever, and encouraging, were an

<P>amusement to his sated mind; and finding nothing in Norfolk

<P>to equal the social pleasures of Mansfield, he gladly

<P>returned to it at the time appointed, and was welcomed

<P>thither quite as gladly by those whom he came to trifle with

<P>further.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Maria, with only Mr. Rushworth to attend to her, and doomed

<P>to the repeated details of his day's sport, good or bad,

<P>his boast of his dogs, his jealousy of his neighbours,

<P>his doubts of their qualifications, and his zeal after poachers,

<P>subjects which will not find their way to female feelings

<P>without some talent on one side or some attachment on

<P>the other, had missed Mr. Crawford grievously; and Julia,

<P>unengaged and unemployed, felt all the right of missing him

<P>much more.&nbsp; Each sister believed herself the favourite.

<P>Julia might be justified in so doing by the hints

<P>of Mrs. Grant, inclined to credit what she wished,

<P>and Maria by the hints of Mr. Crawford himself.

<P>Everything returned into the same channel as before his absence;

<P>his manners being to each so animated and agreeable

<P>as to lose no ground with either, and just stopping short

<P>of the consistence, the steadiness, the solicitude,

<P>and the warmth which might excite general notice.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny was the only one of the party who found anything

<P>to dislike; but since the day at Sotherton, she could never

<P>see Mr. Crawford with either sister without observation,

<P>and seldom without wonder or censure; and had her

<P>confidence in her own judgment been equal to her exercise

<P>of it in every other respect, had she been sure that she

<P>was seeing clearly, and judging candidly, she would

<P>probably have made some important communications to her

<P>usual confidant.&nbsp; As it was, however, she only hazarded

<P>a hint, and the hint was lost.&nbsp; "I am rather surprised,"

<P>said she, "that Mr. Crawford should come back again so soon,

<P>after being here so long before, full seven weeks;

<P>for I had understood he was so very fond of change and

<P>moving about, that I thought something would certainly

<P>occur, when he was once gone, to take him elsewhere.

<P>He is used to much gayer places than Mansfield."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is to his credit," was Edmund's answer; "and I dare

<P>say it gives his sister pleasure.&nbsp; She does not like his

<P>unsettled habits."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What a favourite he is with my cousins!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, his manners to women are such as must please.

<P>Mrs. Grant, I believe, suspects him of a preference for Julia;

<P>I have never seen much symptom of it, but I wish it may

<P>be so.&nbsp; He has no faults but what a serious attachment

<P>would remove."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If Miss Bertram were not engaged," said Fanny cautiously,

<P>"I could sometimes almost think that he admired her more

<P>than Julia."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Which is, perhaps, more in favour of his liking

<P>Julia best, than you, Fanny, may be aware; for I believe

<P>it often happens that a man, before he has quite made up

<P>his own mind, will distinguish the sister or intimate

<P>friend of the woman he is really thinking of more than

<P>the woman herself Crawford has too much sense to stay

<P>here if he found himself in any danger from Maria;

<P>and I am not at all afraid for her, after such a proof

<P>as she has given that her feelings are not strong."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny supposed she must have been mistaken, and meant to

<P>think differently in future; but with all that submission

<P>to Edmund could do, and all the help of the coinciding

<P>looks and hints which she occasionally noticed in some

<P>of the others, and which seemed to say that Julia was

<P>Mr. Crawford's choice, she knew not always what to think.

<P>She was privy, one evening, to the hopes of her aunt

<P>Norris on the subject, as well as to her feelings,

<P>and the feelings of Mrs. Rushworth, on a point of some

<P>similarity, and could not help wondering as she listened;

<P>and glad would she have been not to be obliged to listen,

<P>for it was while all the other young people were dancing,

<P>and she sitting, most unwillingly, among the chaperons at

<P>the fire, longing for the re-entrance of her elder cousin,

<P>on whom all her own hopes of a partner then depended.

<P>It was Fanny's first ball, though without the preparation

<P>or splendour of many a young lady's first ball, being the

<P>thought only of the afternoon, built on the late acquisition

<P>of a violin player in the servants' hall, and the possibility

<P>of raising five couple with the help of Mrs. Grant and a new

<P>intimate friend of Mr. Bertram's just arrived on a visit.

<P>It had, however, been a very happy one to Fanny through

<P>four dances, and she was quite grieved to be losing

<P>even a quarter of an hour.&nbsp; While waiting and wishing,

<P>looking now at the dancers and now at the door, this dialogue

<P>between the two above-mentioned ladies was forced on her--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I think, ma'am," said Mrs. Norris, her eyes directed

<P>towards Mr. Rushworth and Maria, who were partners for

<P>the second time, "we shall see some happy faces again now."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, ma'am, indeed," replied the other, with a stately simper,

<P>"there will be some satisfaction in looking on _now_,

<P>and I think it was rather a pity they should have been

<P>obliged to part.&nbsp; Young folks in their situation

<P>should be excused complying with the common forms.

<P>I wonder my son did not propose it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I dare say he did, ma'am. Mr. Rushworth is never remiss.

<P>But dear Maria has such a strict sense of propriety, so much

<P>of that true delicacy which one seldom meets with nowadays,

<P>Mrs. Rushworth--that wish of avoiding particularity!

<P>Dear ma'am, only look at her face at this moment;

<P>how different from what it was the two last dances!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Miss Bertram did indeed look happy, her eyes were

<P>sparkling with pleasure, and she was speaking with

<P>great animation, for Julia and her partner, Mr. Crawford,

<P>were close to her; they were all in a cluster together.

<P>How she had looked before, Fanny could not recollect,

<P>for she had been dancing with Edmund herself, and had

<P>not thought about her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Norris continued, "It is quite delightful, ma'am, to

<P>see young people so properly happy, so well suited,

<P>and so much the thing!&nbsp; I cannot but think of dear Sir

<P>Thomas's delight.&nbsp; And what do you say, ma'am, to the chance

<P>of another match?&nbsp; Mr. Rushworth has set a good example,

<P>and such things are very catching."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Rushworth, who saw nothing but her son, was quite

<P>at a loss.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The couple above, ma'am. Do you see no symptoms there?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh dear!&nbsp; Miss Julia and Mr. Crawford.&nbsp; Yes, indeed,

<P>a very pretty match.&nbsp; What is his property?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Four thousand a year."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very well.&nbsp; Those who have not more must be satisfied with

<P>what they have.&nbsp; Four thousand a year is a pretty estate,

<P>and he seems a very genteel, steady young man, so I hope

<P>Miss Julia will be very happy."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is not a settled thing, ma'am, yet.&nbsp; We only speak of it

<P>among friends.&nbsp; But I have very little doubt it _will_ be.

<P>He is growing extremely particular in his attentions."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny could listen no farther.&nbsp; Listening and wondering were all

<P>suspended for a time, for Mr. Bertram was in the room again;

<P>and though feeling it would be a great honour to be asked

<P>by him, she thought it must happen.&nbsp; He came towards

<P>their little circle; but instead of asking her to dance,

<P>drew a chair near her, and gave her an account of the present

<P>state of a sick horse, and the opinion of the groom,

<P>from whom he had just parted.&nbsp; Fanny found that it was

<P>not to be, and in the modesty of her nature immediately

<P>felt that she had been unreasonable in expecting it.

<P>When he had told of his horse, he took a newspaper from

<P>the table, and looking over it, said in a languid way,

<P>"If you want to dance, Fanny, I will stand up with you."

<P>With more than equal civility the offer was declined;

<P>she did not wish to dance.&nbsp; "I am glad of it," said he,

<P>in a much brisker tone, and throwing down the newspaper

<P>again, "for I am tired to death.&nbsp; I only wonder how

<P>the good people can keep it up so long.&nbsp; They had need

<P>be _all_ in love, to find any amusement in such folly;

<P>and so they are, I fancy.&nbsp; If you look at them you may

<P>see they are so many couple of lovers--all but Yates

<P>and Mrs. Grant--and, between ourselves, she, poor woman,

<P>must want a lover as much as any one of them.&nbsp; A desperate

<P>dull life hers must be with the doctor," making a sly face

<P>as he spoke towards the chair of the latter, who proving,

<P>however, to be close at his elbow, made so instantaneous

<P>a change of expression and subject necessary, as Fanny,

<P>in spite of everything, could hardly help laughing at.

<P>"A strange business this in America, Dr. Grant!&nbsp; What is

<P>your opinion?&nbsp; I always come to you to know what I am to

<P>think of public matters."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear Tom," cried his aunt soon afterwards, "as you

<P>are not dancing, I dare say you will have no objection

<P>to join us in a rubber; shall you?"&nbsp; Then leaving her seat,

<P>and coming to him to enforce the proposal, added in

<P>a whisper, "We want to make a table for Mrs. Rushworth,

<P>you know.&nbsp; Your mother is quite anxious about it,

<P>but cannot very well spare time to sit down herself,

<P>because of her fringe.&nbsp; Now, you and I and Dr. Grant will

<P>just do; and though _we_ play but half-crowns, you know,

<P>you may bet half-guineas with _him_."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I should be most happy," replied he aloud, and jumping up

<P>with alacrity, "it would give me the greatest pleasure;

<P>but that I am this moment going to dance."&nbsp; Come, Fanny,

<P>taking her hand, "do not be dawdling any longer,

<P>or the dance will be over."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny was led off very willingly, though it was impossible

<P>for her to feel much gratitude towards her cousin,

<P>or distinguish, as he certainly did, between the selfishness

<P>of another person and his own.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A pretty modest request upon my word," he indignantly

<P>exclaimed as they walked away.&nbsp; "To want to nail me

<P>to a card-table for the next two hours with herself and

<P>Dr. Grant, who are always quarrelling, and that poking

<P>old woman, who knows no more of whist than of algebra.

<P>I wish my good aunt would be a little less busy!&nbsp; And to ask

<P>me in such a way too! without ceremony, before them all,

<P>so as to leave me no possibility of refusing.&nbsp; _That_ is

<P>what I dislike most particularly.&nbsp; It raises my spleen

<P>more than anything, to have the pretence of being asked,

<P>of being given a choice, and at the same time addressed

<P>in such a way as to oblige one to do the very thing,

<P>whatever it be!&nbsp; If I had not luckily thought of standing

<P>up with you I could not have got out of it.&nbsp; It is a great

<P>deal too bad.&nbsp; But when my aunt has got a fancy in her head,

<P>nothing can stop her."
