<P>Miss Crawford's uneasiness was much lightened by

<P>this conversation, and she walked home again in spirits

<P>which might have defied almost another week of the same

<P>small party in the same bad weather, had they been put

<P>to the proof; but as that very evening brought her brother

<P>down from London again in quite, or more than quite,

<P>his usual cheerfulness, she had nothing farther to try

<P>her own.&nbsp; His still refusing to tell her what he had gone

<P>for was but the promotion of gaiety; a day before it

<P>might have irritated, but now it was a pleasant joke--

<P>suspected only of concealing something planned as a pleasant

<P>surprise to herself.&nbsp; And the next day _did_ bring a

<P>surprise to her.&nbsp; Henry had said he should just go and ask

<P>the Bertrams how they did, and be back in ten minutes,

<P>but he was gone above an hour; and when his sister,

<P>who had been waiting for him to walk with her in the garden,

<P>met him at last most impatiently in the sweep, and cried out,

<P>"My dear Henry, where can you have been all this time?"

<P>he had only to say that he had been sitting with Lady

<P>Bertram and Fanny.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Sitting with them an hour and a half!" exclaimed Mary.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But this was only the beginning of her surprise.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, Mary," said he, drawing her arm within his,

<P>and walking along the sweep as if not knowing where he was:

<P>"I could not get away sooner; Fanny looked so lovely!

<P>I am quite determined, Mary.&nbsp; My mind is entirely made up.

<P>Will it astonish you?&nbsp; No: you must be aware that I am quite

<P>determined to marry Fanny Price."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The surprise was now complete; for, in spite of whatever

<P>his consciousness might suggest, a suspicion of his having

<P>any such views had never entered his sister's imagination;

<P>and she looked so truly the astonishment she felt, that he

<P>was obliged to repeat what he had said, and more fully

<P>and more solemnly.&nbsp; The conviction of his determination

<P>once admitted, it was not unwelcome.&nbsp; There was even

<P>pleasure with the surprise.&nbsp; Mary was in a state of mind

<P>to rejoice in a connexion with the Bertram family,

<P>and to be not displeased with her brother's marrying

<P>a little beneath him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, Mary," was Henry's concluding assurance.&nbsp; "I am

<P>fairly caught.&nbsp; You know with what idle designs I began;

<P>but this is the end of them.&nbsp; I have, I flatter myself,

<P>made no inconsiderable progress in her affections;

<P>but my own are entirely fixed."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Lucky, lucky girl!" cried Mary, as soon as she could speak;

<P>"what a match for her!&nbsp; My dearest Henry, this must

<P>be my _first_ feeling; but my _second_, which you shall

<P>have as sincerely, is, that I approve your choice from

<P>my soul, and foresee your happiness as heartily as I

<P>wish and desire it.&nbsp; You will have a sweet little wife;

<P>all gratitude and devotion.&nbsp; Exactly what you deserve.

<P>What an amazing match for her!&nbsp; Mrs. Norris often talks

<P>of her luck; what will she say now?&nbsp; The delight of all

<P>the family, indeed!&nbsp; And she has some _true_ friends in it!

<P>How _they_ will rejoice!&nbsp; But tell me all about it!

<P>Talk to me for ever.&nbsp; When did you begin to think seriously

<P>about her?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Nothing could be more impossible than to answer such

<P>a question, though nothing could be more agreeable than

<P>to have it asked.&nbsp; "How the pleasing plague had stolen

<P>on him" he could not say; and before he had expressed

<P>the same sentiment with a little variation of words

<P>three times over, his sister eagerly interrupted him with,

<P>"Ah, my dear Henry, and this is what took you to London!

<P>This was your business!&nbsp; You chose to consult the Admiral

<P>before you made up your mind."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But this he stoutly denied.&nbsp; He knew his uncle too well

<P>to consult him on any matrimonial scheme.&nbsp; The Admiral

<P>hated marriage, and thought it never pardonable in a young

<P>man of independent fortune.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"When Fanny is known to him," continued Henry, "he will doat

<P>on her.&nbsp; She is exactly the woman to do away every prejudice

<P>of such a man as the Admiral, for she he would describe,

<P>if indeed he has now delicacy of language enough to embody

<P>his own ideas.&nbsp; But till it is absolutely settled--

<P>settled beyond all interference, he shall know nothing

<P>of the matter.&nbsp; No, Mary, you are quite mistaken.

<P>You have not discovered my business yet."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, well, I am satisfied.&nbsp; I know now to whom

<P>it must relate, and am in no hurry for the rest.

<P>Fanny Price! wonderful, quite wonderful!&nbsp; That Mansfield

<P>should have done so much for--that _you_ should have

<P>found your fate in Mansfield!&nbsp; But you are quite right;

<P>you could not have chosen better.&nbsp; There is not a better

<P>girl in the world, and you do not want for fortune;

<P>and as to her connexions, they are more than good.

<P>The Bertrams are undoubtedly some of the first people

<P>in this country.&nbsp; She is niece to Sir Thomas Bertram;

<P>that will be enough for the world.&nbsp; But go on, go on.

<P>Tell me more.&nbsp; What are your plans?&nbsp; Does she know her

<P>own happiness?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What are you waiting for?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"For--for very little more than opportunity.&nbsp; Mary, she is

<P>not like her cousins; but I think I shall not ask in vain."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh no! you cannot.&nbsp; Were you even less pleasing--

<P>supposing her not to love you already (of which,

<P>however, I can have little doubt)--you would be safe.

<P>The gentleness and gratitude of her disposition would

<P>secure her all your own immediately.&nbsp; From my soul I do

<P>not think she would marry you _without_ love; that is,

<P>if there is a girl in the world capable of being uninfluenced

<P>by ambition, I can suppose it her; but ask her to love you,

<P>and she will never have the heart to refuse."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As soon as her eagerness could rest in silence,

<P>he was as happy to tell as she could be to listen;

<P>and a conversation followed almost as deeply interesting

<P>to her as to himself, though he had in fact nothing

<P>to relate but his own sensations, nothing to dwell on

<P>but Fanny's charms.&nbsp; Fanny's beauty of face and figure,

<P>Fanny's graces of manner and goodness of heart, were the

<P>exhaustless theme.&nbsp; The gentleness, modesty, and sweetness

<P>of her character were warmly expatiated on; that sweetness

<P>which makes so essential a part of every woman's worth

<P>in the judgment of man, that though he sometimes loves

<P>where it is not, he can never believe it absent.

<P>Her temper he had good reason to depend on and to praise.

<P>He had often seen it tried.&nbsp; Was there one of the family,

<P>excepting Edmund, who had not in some way or other

<P>continually exercised her patience and forbearance?

<P>Her affections were evidently strong.&nbsp; To see her with

<P>her brother!&nbsp; What could more delightfully prove that

<P>the warmth of her heart was equal to its gentleness?

<P>What could be more encouraging to a man who had her love

<P>in view?&nbsp; Then, her understanding was beyond every suspicion,

<P>quick and clear; and her manners were the mirror of

<P>her own modest and elegant mind.&nbsp; Nor was this all.

<P>Henry Crawford had too much sense not to feel the worth of good

<P>principles in a wife, though he was too little accustomed

<P>to serious reflection to know them by their proper name;

<P>but when he talked of her having such a steadiness

<P>and regularity of conduct, such a high notion of honour,

<P>and such an observance of decorum as might warrant any man

<P>in the fullest dependence on her faith and integrity,

<P>he expressed what was inspired by the knowledge of her

<P>being well principled and religious.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I could so wholly and absolutely confide in her," said he;

<P>"and _that_ is what I want."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Well might his sister, believing as she really did that his

<P>opinion of Fanny Price was scarcely beyond her merits,

<P>rejoice in her prospects.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The more I think of it," she cried, "the more am I convinced

<P>that you are doing quite right; and though I should never have

<P>selected Fanny Price as the girl most likely to attach you,

<P>I am now persuaded she is the very one to make you happy.

<P>Your wicked project upon her peace turns out a clever

<P>thought indeed.&nbsp; You will both find your good in it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It was bad, very bad in me against such a creature;

<P>but I did not know her then; and she shall have no reason

<P>to lament the hour that first put it into my head.

<P>I will make her very happy, Mary; happier than she has ever

<P>yet been herself, or ever seen anybody else.&nbsp; I will not

<P>take her from Northamptonshire.&nbsp; I shall let Everingham,

<P>and rent a place in this neighbourhood; perhaps Stanwix Lodge.

<P>I shall let a seven years' lease of Everingham.

<P>I am sure of an excellent tenant at half a word.

<P>I could name three people now, who would give me my own

<P>terms and thank me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ha!" cried Mary; "settle in Northamptonshire!

<P>That is pleasant!&nbsp; Then we shall be all together."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When she had spoken it, she recollected herself,

<P>and wished it unsaid; but there was no need of confusion;

<P>for her brother saw her only as the supposed inmate

<P>of Mansfield parsonage, and replied but to invite her

<P>in the kindest manner to his own house, and to claim

<P>the best right in her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You must give us more than half your time," said he.

<P>"I cannot admit Mrs. Grant to have an equal claim with

<P>Fanny and myself, for we shall both have a right in you.

<P>Fanny will be so truly your sister!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mary had only to be grateful and give general assurances;

<P>but she was now very fully purposed to be the guest of

<P>neither brother nor sister many months longer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You will divide your year between London and Northamptonshire?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That's right; and in London, of course, a house of

<P>your own:&nbsp; no longer with the Admiral.&nbsp; My dearest Henry,

<P>the advantage to you of getting away from the Admiral

<P>before your manners are hurt by the contagion of his,

<P>before you have contracted any of his foolish opinions,

<P>or learned to sit over your dinner as if it were the best

<P>blessing of life!&nbsp; _You_ are not sensible of the gain,

<P>for your regard for him has blinded you; but, in my estimation,

<P>your marrying early may be the saving of you.&nbsp; To have seen

<P>you grow like the Admiral in word or deed, look or gesture,

<P>would have broken my heart."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, well, we do not think quite alike here.

<P>The Admiral has his faults, but he is a very good man,

<P>and has been more than a father to me.&nbsp; Few fathers would

<P>have let me have my own way half so much.&nbsp; You must

<P>not prejudice Fanny against him.&nbsp; I must have them love

<P>one another."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mary refrained from saying what she felt, that there could

<P>not be two persons in existence whose characters and manners

<P>were less accordant:&nbsp; time would discover it to him;

<P>but she could not help _this_ reflection on the Admiral.

<P>"Henry, I think so highly of Fanny Price, that if I could

<P>suppose the next Mrs. Crawford would have half the reason

<P>which my poor ill-used aunt had to abhor the very name,

<P>I would prevent the marriage, if possible; but I know you:

<P>I know that a wife you _loved_ would be the happiest

<P>of women, and that even when you ceased to love, she would

<P>yet find in you the liberality and good-breeding of

<P>a gentleman."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The impossibility of not doing everything in the world to

<P>make Fanny Price happy, or of ceasing to love Fanny Price,

<P>was of course the groundwork of his eloquent answer.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Had you seen her this morning, Mary," he continued,

<P>"attending with such ineffable sweetness and patience to

<P>all the demands of her aunt's stupidity, working with her,

<P>and for her, her colour beautifully heightened as she

<P>leant over the work, then returning to her seat to finish

<P>a note which she was previously engaged in writing

<P>for that stupid woman's service, and all this with such

<P>unpretending gentleness, so much as if it were a matter

<P>of course that she was not to have a moment at her

<P>own command, her hair arranged as neatly as it always is,

<P>and one little curl falling forward as she wrote, which she

<P>now and then shook back, and in the midst of all this,

<P>still speaking at intervals to _me_, or listening,

<P>and as if she liked to listen, to what I said.

<P>Had you seen her so, Mary, you would not have implied

<P>the possibility of her power over my heart ever ceasing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dearest Henry," cried Mary, stopping short, and smiling

<P>in his face, "how glad I am to see you so much in love!

<P>It quite delights me.&nbsp; But what will Mrs. Rushworth and

<P>Julia say?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I care neither what they say nor what they feel.

<P>They will now see what sort of woman it is that can attach me,

<P>that can attach a man of sense.&nbsp; I wish the discovery

<P>may do them any good.&nbsp; And they will now see their cousin

<P>treated as she ought to be, and I wish they may be heartily

<P>ashamed of their own abominable neglect and unkindness.

<P>They will be angry," he added, after a moment's silence,

<P>and in a cooler tone; "Mrs. Rushworth will be very angry.

<P>It will be a bitter pill to her; that is, like other

<P>bitter pills, it will have two moments' ill flavour, and then

<P>be swallowed and forgotten; for I am not such a coxcomb

<P>as to suppose her feelings more lasting than other women's,

<P>though _I_ was the object of them.&nbsp; Yes, Mary, my Fanny

<P>will feel a difference indeed:&nbsp; a daily, hourly difference,

<P>in the behaviour of every being who approaches her;

<P>and it will be the completion of my happiness to know

<P>that I am the doer of it, that I am the person to give

<P>the consequence so justly her due.&nbsp; Now she is dependent,

<P>helpless, friendless, neglected, forgotten."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nay, Henry, not by all; not forgotten by all; not friendless

<P>or forgotten.&nbsp; Her cousin Edmund never forgets her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Edmund!&nbsp; True, I believe he is, generally speaking,

<P>kind to her, and so is Sir Thomas in his way; but it is

<P>the way of a rich, superior, long-worded, arbitrary uncle.

<P>What can Sir Thomas and Edmund together do, what do they

<P>_do_ for her happiness, comfort, honour, and dignity in

<P>the world, to what I _shall_ do?"
