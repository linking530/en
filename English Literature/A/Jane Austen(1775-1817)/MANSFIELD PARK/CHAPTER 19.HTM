<P>How is the consternation of the party to be described?

<P>To the greater number it was a moment of absolute horror.

<P>Sir Thomas in the house!&nbsp; All felt the instantaneous conviction.

<P>Not a hope of imposition or mistake was harboured anywhere.

<P>Julia's looks were an evidence of the fact that made

<P>it indisputable; and after the first starts and exclamations,

<P>not a word was spoken for half a minute:&nbsp; each with

<P>an altered countenance was looking at some other,

<P>and almost each was feeling it a stroke the most unwelcome,

<P>most ill-timed, most appalling!&nbsp; Mr. Yates might consider

<P>it only as a vexatious interruption for the evening,

<P>and Mr. Rushworth might imagine it a blessing; but every

<P>other heart was sinking under some degree of self-condemnation

<P>or undefined alarm, every other heart was suggesting,

<P>"What will become of us? what is to be done now?"

<P>It was a terrible pause; and terrible to every ear were the

<P>corroborating sounds of opening doors and passing footsteps.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Julia was the first to move and speak again.&nbsp; Jealousy and

<P>bitterness had been suspended:&nbsp; selfishness was lost

<P>in the common cause; but at the moment of her appearance,

<P>Frederick was listening with looks of devotion to

<P>Agatha's narrative, and pressing her hand to his heart;

<P>and as soon as she could notice this, and see that,

<P>in spite of the shock of her words, he still kept his

<P>station and retained her sister's hand, her wounded

<P>heart swelled again with injury, and looking as red

<P>as she had been white before, she turned out of the room,

<P>saying, "_I_ need not be afraid of appearing before him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her going roused the rest; and at the same moment

<P>the two brothers stepped forward, feeling the necessity

<P>of doing something.&nbsp; A very few words between them

<P>were sufficient.&nbsp; The case admitted no difference

<P>of opinion:&nbsp; they must go to the drawing-room directly.

<P>Maria joined them with the same intent, just then the

<P>stoutest of the three; for the very circumstance which

<P>had driven Julia away was to her the sweetest support.

<P>Henry Crawford's retaining her hand at such a moment,

<P>a moment of such peculiar proof and importance,

<P>was worth ages of doubt and anxiety.&nbsp; She hailed it

<P>as an earnest of the most serious determination, and was

<P>equal even to encounter her father.&nbsp; They walked off,

<P>utterly heedless of Mr. Rushworth's repeated question of,

<P>"Shall I go too?&nbsp; Had not I better go too?&nbsp; Will not it

<P>be right for me to go too?" but they were no sooner

<P>through the door than Henry Crawford undertook to answer

<P>the anxious inquiry, and, encouraging him by all means

<P>to pay his respects to Sir Thomas without delay,

<P>sent him after the others with delighted haste.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny was left with only the Crawfords and Mr. Yates.

<P>She had been quite overlooked by her cousins; and as her

<P>own opinion of her claims on Sir Thomas's affection

<P>was much too humble to give her any idea of classing

<P>herself with his children, she was glad to remain

<P>behind and gain a little breathing-time. Her agitation

<P>and alarm exceeded all that was endured by the rest,

<P>by the right of a disposition which not even innocence

<P>could keep from suffering.&nbsp; She was nearly fainting:

<P>all her former habitual dread of her uncle was returning,

<P>and with it compassion for him and for almost every one

<P>of the party on the development before him, with solicitude

<P>on Edmund's account indescribable.&nbsp; She had found a seat,

<P>where in excessive trembling she was enduring all these

<P>fearful thoughts, while the other three, no longer under

<P>any restraint, were giving vent to their feelings of vexation,

<P>lamenting over such an unlooked-for premature arrival

<P>as a most untoward event, and without mercy wishing

<P>poor Sir Thomas had been twice as long on his passage,

<P>or were still in Antigua.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The Crawfords were more warm on the subject than Mr. Yates,

<P>from better understanding the family, and judging more

<P>clearly of the mischief that must ensue.&nbsp; The ruin of

<P>the play was to them a certainty:&nbsp; they felt the total

<P>destruction of the scheme to be inevitably at hand;

<P>while Mr. Yates considered it only as a temporary interruption,

<P>a disaster for the evening, and could even suggest the

<P>possibility of the rehearsal being renewed after tea,

<P>when the bustle of receiving Sir Thomas were over,

<P>and he might be at leisure to be amused by it.

<P>The Crawfords laughed at the idea; and having soon

<P>agreed on the propriety of their walking quietly home

<P>and leaving the family to themselves, proposed Mr. Yates's

<P>accompanying them and spending the evening at the Parsonage.

<P>But Mr. Yates, having never been with those who thought much

<P>of parental claims, or family confidence, could not perceive

<P>that anything of the kind was necessary; and therefore,

<P>thanking them, said, "he preferred remaining where he was,

<P>that he might pay his respects to the old gentleman

<P>handsomely since he _was_ come; and besides, he did not

<P>think it would be fair by the others to have everybody run away."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny was just beginning to collect herself,

<P>and to feel that if she staid longer behind it might

<P>seem disrespectful, when this point was settled, and being

<P>commissioned with the brother and sister's apology,

<P>saw them preparing to go as she quitted the room herself

<P>to perform the dreadful duty of appearing before her uncle.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Too soon did she find herself at the drawing-room door;

<P>and after pausing a moment for what she knew would not come,

<P>for a courage which the outside of no door had ever supplied

<P>to her, she turned the lock in desperation, and the lights

<P>of the drawing-room, and all the collected family,

<P>were before her.&nbsp; As she entered, her own name caught

<P>her ear.&nbsp; Sir Thomas was at that moment looking round him,

<P>and saying, "But where is Fanny?&nbsp; Why do not I see

<P>my little Fanny?"--and on perceiving her, came forward

<P>with a kindness which astonished and penetrated her,

<P>calling her his dear Fanny, kissing her affectionately,

<P>and observing with decided pleasure how much she was grown!

<P>Fanny knew not how to feel, nor where to look.&nbsp; She was

<P>quite oppressed.&nbsp; He had never been so kind, so _very_

<P>kind to her in his life.&nbsp; His manner seemed changed,

<P>his voice was quick from the agitation of joy; and all that

<P>had been awful in his dignity seemed lost in tenderness.

<P>He led her nearer the light and looked at her again--

<P>inquired particularly after her health, and then,

<P>correcting himself, observed that he need not inquire,

<P>for her appearance spoke sufficiently on that point.&nbsp; A fine

<P>blush having succeeded the previous paleness of her face,

<P>he was justified in his belief of her equal improvement

<P>in health and beauty.&nbsp; He inquired next after her family,

<P>especially William:&nbsp; and his kindness altogether was such

<P>as made her reproach herself for loving him so little,

<P>and thinking his return a misfortune; and when, on having

<P>courage to lift her eyes to his face, she saw that he

<P>was grown thinner, and had the burnt, fagged, worn look

<P>of fatigue and a hot climate, every tender feeling

<P>was increased, and she was miserable in considering

<P>how much unsuspected vexation was probably ready to burst

<P>on him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sir Thomas was indeed the life of the party, who at

<P>his suggestion now seated themselves round the fire.

<P>He had the best right to be the talker; and the delight

<P>of his sensations in being again in his own house,

<P>in the centre of his family, after such a separation,

<P>made him communicative and chatty in a very unusual degree;

<P>and he was ready to give every information as to his voyage,

<P>and answer every question of his two sons almost before

<P>it was put.&nbsp; His business in Antigua had latterly been

<P>prosperously rapid, and he came directly from Liverpool,

<P>having had an opportunity of making his passage thither

<P>in a private vessel, instead of waiting for the packet;

<P>and all the little particulars of his proceedings and events,

<P>his arrivals and departures, were most promptly delivered,

<P>as he sat by Lady Bertram and looked with heartfelt

<P>satisfaction on the faces around him--interrupting himself

<P>more than once, however, to remark on his good fortune

<P>in finding them all at home--coming unexpectedly as he did--

<P>all collected together exactly as he could have wished,

<P>but dared not depend on.&nbsp; Mr. Rushworth was not forgotten:

<P>a most friendly reception and warmth of hand-shaking

<P>had already met him, and with pointed attention he was

<P>now included in the objects most intimately connected

<P>with Mansfield.&nbsp; There was nothing disagreeable in

<P>Mr. Rushworth's appearance, and Sir Thomas was liking

<P>him already.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>By not one of the circle was he listened to with such unbroken,

<P>unalloyed enjoyment as by his wife, who was really

<P>extremely happy to see him, and whose feelings were

<P>so warmed by his sudden arrival as to place her nearer

<P>agitation than she had been for the last twenty years.

<P>She had been _almost_ fluttered for a few minutes,

<P>and still remained so sensibly animated as to put away

<P>her work, move Pug from her side, and give all her

<P>attention and all the rest of her sofa to her husband.

<P>She had no anxieties for anybody to cloud _her_ pleasure:

<P>her own time had been irreproachably spent during his absence:

<P>she had done a great deal of carpet-work, and made many

<P>yards of fringe; and she would have answered as freely

<P>for the good conduct and useful pursuits of all the young

<P>people as for her own.&nbsp; It was so agreeable to her to see

<P>him again, and hear him talk, to have her ear amused

<P>and her whole comprehension filled by his narratives,

<P>that she began particularly to feel how dreadfully she

<P>must have missed him, and how impossible it would have

<P>been for her to bear a lengthened absence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Norris was by no means to be compared in happiness

<P>to her sister.&nbsp; Not that _she_ was incommoded by many

<P>fears of Sir Thomas's disapprobation when the present

<P>state of his house should be known, for her judgment

<P>had been so blinded that, except by the instinctive

<P>caution with which she had whisked away Mr. Rushworth's

<P>pink satin cloak as her brother-in-law entered,

<P>she could hardly be said to shew any sign of alarm;

<P>but she was vexed by the _manner_ of his return.

<P>It had left her nothing to do.&nbsp; Instead of being sent

<P>for out of the room, and seeing him first, and having

<P>to spread the happy news through the house, Sir Thomas,

<P>with a very reasonable dependence, perhaps, on the nerves

<P>of his wife and children, had sought no confidant but

<P>the butler, and had been following him almost instantaneously

<P>into the drawing-room. Mrs. Norris felt herself defrauded

<P>of an office on which she had always depended, whether his

<P>arrival or his death were to be the thing unfolded;

<P>and was now trying to be in a bustle without having

<P>anything to bustle about, and labouring to be important

<P>where nothing was wanted but tranquillity and silence.

<P>Would Sir Thomas have consented to eat, she might have gone

<P>to the housekeeper with troublesome directions, and insulted

<P>the footmen with injunctions of despatch; but Sir Thomas

<P>resolutely declined all dinner:&nbsp; he would take nothing,

<P>nothing till tea came--he would rather wait for tea.

<P>Still Mrs. Norris was at intervals urging something different;

<P>and in the most interesting moment of his passage to England,

<P>when the alarm of a French privateer was at the height,

<P>she burst through his recital with the proposal of soup.

<P>"Sure, my dear Sir Thomas, a basin of soup would be

<P>a much better thing for you than tea.&nbsp; Do have a basin

<P>of soup."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sir Thomas could not be provoked.&nbsp; "Still the same

<P>anxiety for everybody's comfort, my dear Mrs. Norris,"

<P>was his answer.&nbsp; "But indeed I would rather have nothing

<P>but tea."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, then, Lady Bertram, suppose you speak for

<P>tea directly; suppose you hurry Baddeley a little;

<P>he seems behindhand to-night." She carried this point,

<P>and Sir Thomas's narrative proceeded.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At length there was a pause.&nbsp; His immediate communications

<P>were exhausted, and it seemed enough to be looking joyfully

<P>around him, now at one, now at another of the beloved circle;

<P>but the pause was not long:&nbsp; in the elation of her

<P>spirits Lady Bertram became talkative, and what were

<P>the sensations of her children upon hearing her say,

<P>"How do you think the young people have been amusing

<P>themselves lately, Sir Thomas?&nbsp; They have been acting.

<P>We have been all alive with acting."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Indeed! and what have you been acting?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! they'll tell you all about it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The _all_ will soon be told," cried Tom hastily,

<P>and with affected unconcern; "but it is not worth

<P>while to bore my father with it now.&nbsp; You will hear

<P>enough of it to-morrow, sir.&nbsp; We have just been trying,

<P>by way of doing something, and amusing my mother,

<P>just within the last week, to get up a few scenes,

<P>a mere trifle.&nbsp; We have had such incessant rains almost

<P>since October began, that we have been nearly confined

<P>to the house for days together.&nbsp; I have hardly taken out

<P>a gun since the 3rd.&nbsp; Tolerable sport the first three days,

<P>but there has been no attempting anything since.

<P>The first day I went over Mansfield Wood, and Edmund took

<P>the copses beyond Easton, and we brought home six brace

<P>between us, and might each have killed six times as many,

<P>but we respect your pheasants, sir, I assure you,

<P>as much as you could desire.&nbsp; I do not think you will find

<P>your woods by any means worse stocked than they were.

<P>_I_ never saw Mansfield Wood so full of pheasants in my

<P>life as this year.&nbsp; I hope you will take a day's sport

<P>there yourself, sir, soon."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For the present the danger was over, and Fanny's sick

<P>feelings subsided; but when tea was soon afterwards

<P>brought in, and Sir Thomas, getting up, said that he found

<P>that he could not be any longer in the house without

<P>just looking into his own dear room, every agitation

<P>was returning.&nbsp; He was gone before anything had been

<P>said to prepare him for the change he must find there;

<P>and a pause of alarm followed his disappearance.

<P>Edmund was the first to speak--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Something must be done," said he.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is time to think of our visitors," said Maria,

<P>still feeling her hand pressed to Henry Crawford's heart,

<P>and caring little for anything else.&nbsp; "Where did you leave

<P>Miss Crawford, Fanny?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny told of their departure, and delivered their message.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then poor Yates is all alone," cried Tom.&nbsp; "I will go

<P>and fetch him.&nbsp; He will be no bad assistant when it

<P>all comes out."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To the theatre he went, and reached it just in time to

<P>witness the first meeting of his father and his friend.

<P>Sir Thomas had been a good deal surprised to find candles

<P>burning in his room; and on casting his eye round it,

<P>to see other symptoms of recent habitation and a general

<P>air of confusion in the furniture.&nbsp; The removal of the

<P>bookcase from before the billiard-room door struck

<P>him especially, but he had scarcely more than time

<P>to feel astonished at all this, before there were sounds

<P>from the billiard-room to astonish him still farther.

<P>Some one was talking there in a very loud accent; he did

<P>not know the voice--more than talking--almost hallooing.

<P>He stepped to the door, rejoicing at that moment in having

<P>the means of immediate communication, and, opening it,

<P>found himself on the stage of a theatre, and opposed

<P>to a ranting young man, who appeared likely to knock him

<P>down backwards.&nbsp; At the very moment of Yates perceiving

<P>Sir Thomas, and giving perhaps the very best start he

<P>had ever given in the whole course of his rehearsals,

<P>Tom Bertram entered at the other end of the room;

<P>and never had he found greater difficulty in keeping

<P>his countenance.&nbsp; His father's looks of solemnity and

<P>amazement on this his first appearance on any stage,

<P>and the gradual metamorphosis of the impassioned Baron

<P>Wildenheim into the well-bred and easy Mr. Yates,

<P>making his bow and apology to Sir Thomas Bertram, was such

<P>an exhibition, such a piece of true acting, as he would

<P>not have lost upon any account.&nbsp; It would be the last--

<P>in all probability--the last scene on that stage; but he

<P>was sure there could not be a finer.&nbsp; The house would

<P>close with the greatest eclat.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was little time, however, for the indulgence

<P>of any images of merriment.&nbsp; It was necessary for him

<P>to step forward, too, and assist the introduction,

<P>and with many awkward sensations he did his best.

<P>Sir Thomas received Mr. Yates with all the appearance

<P>of cordiality which was due to his own character,

<P>but was really as far from pleased with the necessity of

<P>the acquaintance as with the manner of its commencement.

<P>Mr. Yates's family and connexions were sufficiently known

<P>to him to render his introduction as the "particular friend,"

<P>another of the hundred particular friends of his son,

<P>exceedingly unwelcome; and it needed all the felicity of being

<P>again at home, and all the forbearance it could supply,

<P>to save Sir Thomas from anger on finding himself thus

<P>bewildered in his own house, making part of a ridiculous

<P>exhibition in the midst of theatrical nonsense, and forced

<P>in so untoward a moment to admit the acquaintance of a young

<P>man whom he felt sure of disapproving, and whose easy

<P>indifference and volubility in the course of the first

<P>five minutes seemed to mark him the most at home of the two.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Tom understood his father's thoughts, and heartily

<P>wishing he might be always as well disposed to give them

<P>but partial expression, began to see, more clearly than

<P>he had ever done before, that there might be some ground

<P>of offence, that there might be some reason for the glance

<P>his father gave towards the ceiling and stucco of the room;

<P>and that when he inquired with mild gravity after the fate

<P>of the billiard-table, he was not proceeding beyond

<P>a very allowable curiosity.&nbsp; A few minutes were enough

<P>for such unsatisfactory sensations on each side; and Sir

<P>Thomas having exerted himself so far as to speak a few

<P>words of calm approbation in reply to an eager appeal

<P>of Mr. Yates, as to the happiness of the arrangement,

<P>the three gentlemen returned to the drawing-room together,

<P>Sir Thomas with an increase of gravity which was not

<P>lost on all.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I come from your theatre," said he composedly, as he

<P>sat down; "I found myself in it rather unexpectedly.

<P>Its vicinity to my own room--but in every respect, indeed,

<P>it took me by surprise, as I had not the smallest suspicion

<P>of your acting having assumed so serious a character.

<P>It appears a neat job, however, as far as I could judge

<P>by candlelight, and does my friend Christopher Jackson credit."

<P>And then he would have changed the subject, and sipped

<P>his coffee in peace over domestic matters of a calmer hue;

<P>but Mr. Yates, without discernment to catch Sir Thomas's meaning,

<P>or diffidence, or delicacy, or discretion enough to allow

<P>him to lead the discourse while he mingled among the others

<P>with the least obtrusiveness himself, would keep him on

<P>the topic of the theatre, would torment him with questions

<P>and remarks relative to it, and finally would make him hear

<P>the whole history of his disappointment at Ecclesford.

<P>Sir Thomas listened most politely, but found much to

<P>offend his ideas of decorum, and confirm his ill-opinion

<P>of Mr. Yates's habits of thinking, from the beginning

<P>to the end of the story; and when it was over, could give

<P>him no other assurance of sympathy than what a slight bow conveyed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This was, in fact, the origin of _our_ acting," said Tom,

<P>after a moment's thought.&nbsp; "My friend Yates brought the

<P>infection from Ecclesford, and it spread--as those things

<P>always spread, you know, sir--the faster, probably,

<P>from _your_ having so often encouraged the sort of thing

<P>in us formerly.&nbsp; It was like treading old ground again."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Yates took the subject from his friend as soon as possible,

<P>and immediately gave Sir Thomas an account of what they

<P>had done and were doing:&nbsp; told him of the gradual

<P>increase of their views, the happy conclusion of their

<P>first difficulties, and present promising state of affairs;

<P>relating everything with so blind an interest as made him

<P>not only totally unconscious of the uneasy movements of many

<P>of his friends as they sat, the change of countenance,

<P>the fidget, the hem! of unquietness, but prevented him

<P>even from seeing the expression of the face on which his

<P>own eyes were fixed--from seeing Sir Thomas's dark brow

<P>contract as he looked with inquiring earnestness at his

<P>daughters and Edmund, dwelling particularly on the latter,

<P>and speaking a language, a remonstrance, a reproof,

<P>which _he_ felt at his heart.&nbsp; Not less acutely was it

<P>felt by Fanny, who had edged back her chair behind her

<P>aunt's end of the sofa, and, screened from notice herself,

<P>saw all that was passing before her.&nbsp; Such a look

<P>of reproach at Edmund from his father she could never

<P>have expected to witness; and to feel that it was in any

<P>degree deserved was an aggravation indeed.&nbsp; Sir Thomas's

<P>look implied, "On your judgment, Edmund, I depended;

<P>what have you been about?"&nbsp; She knelt in spirit to her uncle,

<P>and her bosom swelled to utter, "Oh, not to _him_!

<P>Look so to all the others, but not to _him_!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Yates was still talking.&nbsp; "To own the truth, Sir Thomas,

<P>we were in the middle of a rehearsal when you arrived

<P>this evening.&nbsp; We were going through the three first acts,

<P>and not unsuccessfully upon the whole.&nbsp; Our company is

<P>now so dispersed, from the Crawfords being gone home,

<P>that nothing more can be done to-night; but if you will

<P>give us the honour of your company to-morrow evening,

<P>I should not be afraid of the result.&nbsp; We bespeak

<P>your indulgence, you understand, as young performers;

<P>we bespeak your indulgence."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My indulgence shall be given, sir," replied Sir

<P>Thomas gravely, "but without any other rehearsal."

<P>And with a relenting smile, he added, "I come home

<P>to be happy and indulgent."&nbsp; Then turning away towards

<P>any or all of the rest, he tranquilly said, "Mr. and Miss

<P>Crawford were mentioned in my last letters from Mansfield.

<P>Do you find them agreeable acquaintance?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Tom was the only one at all ready with an answer, but he

<P>being entirely without particular regard for either,

<P>without jealousy either in love or acting, could speak

<P>very handsomely of both.&nbsp; "Mr. Crawford was a most pleasant,

<P>gentleman-like man; his sister a sweet, pretty, elegant,

<P>lively girl."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Rushworth could be silent no longer.&nbsp; "I do not say

<P>he is not gentleman-like, considering; but you should

<P>tell your father he is not above five feet eight,

<P>or he will be expecting a well-looking man."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sir Thomas did not quite understand this, and looked

<P>with some surprise at the speaker.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If I must say what I think," continued Mr. Rushworth, "in my

<P>opinion it is very disagreeable to be always rehearsing.

<P>It is having too much of a good thing.&nbsp; I am not so fond

<P>of acting as I was at first.&nbsp; I think we are a great deal

<P>better employed, sitting comfortably here among ourselves,

<P>and doing nothing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sir Thomas looked again, and then replied with an approving

<P>smile, "I am happy to find our sentiments on this subject

<P>so much the same.&nbsp; It gives me sincere satisfaction.

<P>That I should be cautious and quick-sighted, and feel many

<P>scruples which my children do _not_ feel, is perfectly natural;

<P>and equally so that my value for domestic tranquillity,

<P>for a home which shuts out noisy pleasures, should much

<P>exceed theirs.&nbsp; But at your time of life to feel all this,

<P>is a most favourable circumstance for yourself,

<P>and for everybody connected with you; and I am sensible

<P>of the importance of having an ally of such weight."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sir Thomas meant to be giving Mr. Rushworth's opinion

<P>in better words than he could find himself.&nbsp; He was

<P>aware that he must not expect a genius in Mr. Rushworth;

<P>but as a well-judging, steady young man, with better notions

<P>than his elocution would do justice to, he intended to value

<P>him very highly.&nbsp; It was impossible for many of the others

<P>not to smile.&nbsp; Mr. Rushworth hardly knew what to do

<P>with so much meaning; but by looking, as he really felt,

<P>most exceedingly pleased with Sir Thomas's good opinion,

<P>and saying scarcely anything, he did his best towards

<P>preserving that good opinion a little longer.
