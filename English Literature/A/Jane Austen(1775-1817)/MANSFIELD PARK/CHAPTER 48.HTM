<P>Let other pens dwell on guilt and misery.&nbsp; I quit such odious

<P>subjects as soon as I can, impatient to restore everybody,

<P>not greatly in fault themselves, to tolerable comfort,

<P>and to have done with all the rest.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>My Fanny, indeed, at this very time, I have the satisfaction

<P>of knowing, must have been happy in spite of everything.

<P>She must have been a happy creature in spite of all that she felt,

<P>or thought she felt, for the distress of those around her.

<P>She had sources of delight that must force their way.

<P>She was returned to Mansfield Park, she was useful,

<P>she was beloved; she was safe from Mr. Crawford;

<P>and when Sir Thomas came back she had every proof that

<P>could be given in his then melancholy state of spirits,

<P>of his perfect approbation and increased regard;

<P>and happy as all this must make her, she would still have

<P>been happy without any of it, for Edmund was no longer

<P>the dupe of Miss Crawford.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It is true that Edmund was very far from happy himself.

<P>He was suffering from disappointment and regret,

<P>grieving over what was, and wishing for what could never be.

<P>She knew it was so, and was sorry; but it was with a

<P>sorrow so founded on satisfaction, so tending to ease,

<P>and so much in harmony with every dearest sensation,

<P>that there are few who might not have been glad to exchange

<P>their greatest gaiety for it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sir Thomas, poor Sir Thomas, a parent, and conscious of errors

<P>in his own conduct as a parent, was the longest to suffer.

<P>He felt that he ought not to have allowed the marriage;

<P>that his daughter's sentiments had been sufficiently known

<P>to him to render him culpable in authorising it; that in so

<P>doing he had sacrificed the right to the expedient, and been

<P>governed by motives of selfishness and worldly wisdom.

<P>These were reflections that required some time to soften;

<P>but time will do almost everything; and though little

<P>comfort arose on Mrs. Rushworth's side for the misery she

<P>had occasioned, comfort was to be found greater than he had

<P>supposed in his other children.&nbsp; Julia's match became a less

<P>desperate business than he had considered it at first.

<P>She was humble, and wishing to be forgiven; and Mr. Yates,

<P>desirous of being really received into the family, was disposed

<P>to look up to him and be guided.&nbsp; He was not very solid;

<P>but there was a hope of his becoming less trifling,

<P>of his being at least tolerably domestic and quiet;

<P>and at any rate, there was comfort in finding his estate

<P>rather more, and his debts much less, than he had feared,

<P>and in being consulted and treated as the friend best

<P>worth attending to.&nbsp; There was comfort also in Tom,

<P>who gradually regained his health, without regaining the

<P>thoughtlessness and selfishness of his previous habits.

<P>He was the better for ever for his illness.&nbsp; He had suffered,

<P>and he had learned to think:&nbsp; two advantages that he had

<P>never known before; and the self-reproach arising from

<P>the deplorable event in Wimpole Street, to which he felt

<P>himself accessory by all the dangerous intimacy of his

<P>unjustifiable theatre, made an impression on his mind which,

<P>at the age of six-and-twenty, with no want of sense

<P>or good companions, was durable in its happy effects.

<P>He became what he ought to be:&nbsp; useful to his father,

<P>steady and quiet, and not living merely for himself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Here was comfort indeed! and quite as soon as Sir

<P>Thomas could place dependence on such sources of good,

<P>Edmund was contributing to his father's ease by improvement

<P>in the only point in which he had given him pain before--

<P>improvement in his spirits.&nbsp; After wandering about and

<P>sitting under trees with Fanny all the summer evenings,

<P>he had so well talked his mind into submission as to be

<P>very tolerably cheerful again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>These were the circumstances and the hopes which gradually

<P>brought their alleviation to Sir Thomas, deadening his sense

<P>of what was lost, and in part reconciling him to himself;

<P>though the anguish arising from the conviction of his

<P>own errors in the education of his daughters was never

<P>to be entirely done away.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Too late he became aware how unfavourable to the character

<P>of any young people must be the totally opposite treatment

<P>which Maria and Julia had been always experiencing at home,

<P>where the excessive indulgence and flattery of their aunt

<P>had been continually contrasted with his own severity.

<P>He saw how ill he had judged, in expecting to counteract

<P>what was wrong in Mrs. Norris by its reverse in himself;

<P>clearly saw that he had but increased the evil by teaching

<P>them to repress their spirits in his presence so as to make

<P>their real disposition unknown to him, and sending them

<P>for all their indulgences to a person who had been able

<P>to attach them only by the blindness of her affection,

<P>and the excess of her praise.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Here had been grievous mismanagement; but, bad as it was,

<P>he gradually grew to feel that it had not been the most

<P>direful mistake in his plan of education.&nbsp; Something must

<P>have been wanting _within_, or time would have worn

<P>away much of its ill effect.&nbsp; He feared that principle,

<P>active principle, had been wanting; that they had never

<P>been properly taught to govern their inclinations and

<P>tempers by that sense of duty which can alone suffice.

<P>They had been instructed theoretically in their religion,

<P>but never required to bring it into daily practice.

<P>To be distinguished for elegance and accomplishments,

<P>the authorised object of their youth, could have had no

<P>useful influence that way, no moral effect on the mind.

<P>He had meant them to be good, but his cares had been directed

<P>to the understanding and manners, not the disposition;

<P>and of the necessity of self-denial and humility,

<P>he feared they had never heard from any lips that could

<P>profit them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Bitterly did he deplore a deficiency which now he

<P>could scarcely comprehend to have been possible.

<P>Wretchedly did he feel, that with all the cost and care

<P>of an anxious and expensive education, he had brought up

<P>his daughters without their understanding their first duties,

<P>or his being acquainted with their character and temper.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The high spirit and strong passions of Mrs. Rushworth,

<P>especially, were made known to him only in their sad result.

<P>She was not to be prevailed on to leave Mr. Crawford.

<P>She hoped to marry him, and they continued together

<P>till she was obliged to be convinced that such hope

<P>was vain, and till the disappointment and wretchedness

<P>arising from the conviction rendered her temper so bad,

<P>and her feelings for him so like hatred, as to make them

<P>for a while each other's punishment, and then induce

<P>a voluntary separation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She had lived with him to be reproached as the ruin

<P>of all his happiness in Fanny, and carried away no better

<P>consolation in leaving him than that she _had_ divided them.

<P>What can exceed the misery of such a mind in such a situation?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Rushworth had no difficulty in procuring a divorce;

<P>and so ended a marriage contracted under such circumstances

<P>as to make any better end the effect of good luck not to

<P>be reckoned on.&nbsp; She had despised him, and loved another;

<P>and he had been very much aware that it was so.

<P>The indignities of stupidity, and the disappointments

<P>of selfish passion, can excite little pity.&nbsp; His punishment

<P>followed his conduct, as did a deeper punishment the

<P>deeper guilt of his wife.&nbsp; _He_ was released from the

<P>engagement to be mortified and unhappy, till some other

<P>pretty girl could attract him into matrimony again,

<P>and he might set forward on a second, and, it is to

<P>be hoped, more prosperous trial of the state:&nbsp; if duped,

<P>to be duped at least with good humour and good luck;

<P>while she must withdraw with infinitely stronger feelings

<P>to a retirement and reproach which could allow no second

<P>spring of hope or character.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Where she could be placed became a subject of most

<P>melancholy and momentous consultation.&nbsp; Mrs. Norris,

<P>whose attachment seemed to augment with the demerits

<P>of her niece, would have had her received at home and

<P>countenanced by them all.&nbsp; Sir Thomas would not hear of it;

<P>and Mrs. Norris's anger against Fanny was so much the greater,

<P>from considering _her_ residence there as the motive.

<P>She persisted in placing his scruples to _her_ account,

<P>though Sir Thomas very solemnly assured her that,

<P>had there been no young woman in question, had there

<P>been no young person of either sex belonging to him,

<P>to be endangered by the society or hurt by the character

<P>of Mrs. Rushworth, he would never have offered so great an

<P>insult to the neighbourhood as to expect it to notice her.

<P>As a daughter, he hoped a penitent one, she should be

<P>protected by him, and secured in every comfort, and supported

<P>by every encouragement to do right, which their relative

<P>situations admitted; but farther than _that_ he could not go.

<P>Maria had destroyed her own character, and he would not,

<P>by a vain attempt to restore what never could be restored,

<P>by affording his sanction to vice, or in seeking to lessen

<P>its disgrace, be anywise accessory to introducing such

<P>misery in another man's family as he had known himself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It ended in Mrs. Norris's resolving to quit Mansfield

<P>and devote herself to her unfortunate Maria, and in an

<P>establishment being formed for them in another country,

<P>remote and private, where, shut up together with little society,

<P>on one side no affection, on the other no judgment,

<P>it may be reasonably supposed that their tempers became

<P>their mutual punishment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Norris's removal from Mansfield was the great supplementary

<P>comfort of Sir Thomas's life.&nbsp; His opinion of her had

<P>been sinking from the day of his return from Antigua:

<P>in every transaction together from that period, in their

<P>daily intercourse, in business, or in chat, she had been

<P>regularly losing ground in his esteem, and convincing

<P>him that either time had done her much disservice,

<P>or that he had considerably over-rated her sense,

<P>and wonderfully borne with her manners before.&nbsp; He had

<P>felt her as an hourly evil, which was so much the worse,

<P>as there seemed no chance of its ceasing but with life;

<P>she seemed a part of himself that must be borne for ever.

<P>To be relieved from her, therefore, was so great a

<P>felicity that, had she not left bitter remembrances

<P>behind her, there might have been danger of his learning

<P>almost to approve the evil which produced such a good.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was regretted by no one at Mansfield.&nbsp; She had never

<P>been able to attach even those she loved best; and since

<P>Mrs. Rushworth's elopement, her temper had been in a state

<P>of such irritation as to make her everywhere tormenting.

<P>Not even Fanny had tears for aunt Norris, not even when

<P>she was gone for ever.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>That Julia escaped better than Maria was owing, in some measure,

<P>to a favourable difference of disposition and circumstance,

<P>but in a greater to her having been less the darling

<P>of that very aunt, less flattered and less spoilt.

<P>Her beauty and acquirements had held but a second place.

<P>She had been always used to think herself a little inferior

<P>to Maria.&nbsp; Her temper was naturally the easiest of the two;

<P>her feelings, though quick, were more controllable,

<P>and education had not given her so very hurtful a degree

<P>of self-consequence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She had submitted the best to the disappointment

<P>in Henry Crawford.&nbsp; After the first bitterness of the

<P>conviction of being slighted was over, she had been

<P>tolerably soon in a fair way of not thinking of him again;

<P>and when the acquaintance was renewed in town,

<P>and Mr. Rushworth's house became Crawford's object,

<P>she had had the merit of withdrawing herself from it,

<P>and of chusing that time to pay a visit to her other friends,

<P>in order to secure herself from being again too much attracted.

<P>This had been her motive in going to her cousin's.

<P>Mr. Yates's convenience had had nothing to do with it.

<P>She had been allowing his attentions some time,

<P>but with very little idea of ever accepting him;

<P>and had not her sister's conduct burst forth as it did,

<P>and her increased dread of her father and of home,

<P>on that event, imagining its certain consequence to herself

<P>would be greater severity and restraint, made her hastily

<P>resolve on avoiding such immediate horrors at all risks,

<P>it is probable that Mr. Yates would never have succeeded.

<P>She had not eloped with any worse feelings than those

<P>of selfish alarm.&nbsp; It had appeared to her the only

<P>thing to be done.&nbsp; Maria's guilt had induced Julia's folly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Henry Crawford, ruined by early independence and bad

<P>domestic example, indulged in the freaks of a cold-blooded

<P>vanity a little too long.&nbsp; Once it had, by an opening

<P>undesigned and unmerited, led him into the way of happiness.

<P>Could he have been satisfied with the conquest of one

<P>amiable woman's affections, could he have found sufficient

<P>exultation in overcoming the reluctance, in working himself

<P>into the esteem and tenderness of Fanny Price, there would

<P>have been every probability of success and felicity for him.

<P>His affection had already done something.&nbsp; Her influence

<P>over him had already given him some influence over her.

<P>Would he have deserved more, there can be no doubt

<P>that more would have been obtained, especially when

<P>that marriage had taken place, which would have given

<P>him the assistance of her conscience in subduing her

<P>first inclination, and brought them very often together.

<P>Would he have persevered, and uprightly, Fanny must have

<P>been his reward, and a reward very voluntarily bestowed,

<P>within a reasonable period from Edmund's marrying Mary.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Had he done as he intended, and as he knew he ought,

<P>by going down to Everingham after his return from Portsmouth,

<P>he might have been deciding his own happy destiny.

<P>But he was pressed to stay for Mrs. Fraser's party;

<P>his staying was made of flattering consequence, and he

<P>was to meet Mrs. Rushworth there.&nbsp; Curiosity and vanity

<P>were both engaged, and the temptation of immediate pleasure

<P>was too strong for a mind unused to make any sacrifice

<P>to right:&nbsp; he resolved to defer his Norfolk journey,

<P>resolved that writing should answer the purpose of it,

<P>or that its purpose was unimportant, and staid.&nbsp; He saw

<P>Mrs. Rushworth, was received by her with a coldness which

<P>ought to have been repulsive, and have established apparent

<P>indifference between them for ever; but he was mortified,

<P>he could not bear to be thrown off by the woman whose

<P>smiles had been so wholly at his command:&nbsp; he must exert

<P>himself to subdue so proud a display of resentment; it was

<P>anger on Fanny's account; he must get the better of it,

<P>and make Mrs. Rushworth Maria Bertram again in her treatment

<P>of himself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In this spirit he began the attack, and by animated

<P>perseverance had soon re-established the sort of familiar

<P>intercourse, of gallantry, of flirtation, which bounded

<P>his views; but in triumphing over the discretion which,

<P>though beginning in anger, might have saved them both,

<P>he had put himself in the power of feelings on her side

<P>more strong than he had supposed.&nbsp; She loved him;

<P>there was no withdrawing attentions avowedly dear to her.

<P>He was entangled by his own vanity, with as little

<P>excuse of love as possible, and without the smallest

<P>inconstancy of mind towards her cousin.&nbsp; To keep Fanny

<P>and the Bertrams from a knowledge of what was passing

<P>became his first object.&nbsp; Secrecy could not have been

<P>more desirable for Mrs. Rushworth's credit than he

<P>felt it for his own.&nbsp; When he returned from Richmond,

<P>he would have been glad to see Mrs. Rushworth no more.

<P>All that followed was the result of her imprudence;

<P>and he went off with her at last, because he could

<P>not help it, regretting Fanny even at the moment,

<P>but regretting her infinitely more when all the bustle of

<P>the intrigue was over, and a very few months had taught him,

<P>by the force of contrast, to place a yet higher value

<P>on the sweetness of her temper, the purity of her mind,

<P>and the excellence of her principles.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>That punishment, the public punishment of disgrace,

<P>should in a just measure attend _his_ share of the offence is,

<P>we know, not one of the barriers which society gives

<P>to virtue.&nbsp; In this world the penalty is less equal than

<P>could be wished; but without presuming to look forward

<P>to a juster appointment hereafter, we may fairly consider

<P>a man of sense, like Henry Crawford, to be providing

<P>for himself no small portion of vexation and regret:

<P>vexation that must rise sometimes to self-reproach, and

<P>regret to wretchedness, in having so requited hospitality,

<P>so injured family peace, so forfeited his best, most estimable,

<P>and endeared acquaintance, and so lost the woman whom

<P>he had rationally as well as passionately loved.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After what had passed to wound and alienate the two families,

<P>the continuance of the Bertrams and Grants in such

<P>close neighbourhood would have been most distressing;

<P>but the absence of the latter, for some months purposely

<P>lengthened, ended very fortunately in the necessity,

<P>or at least the practicability, of a permanent removal.

<P>Dr. Grant, through an interest on which he had almost

<P>ceased to form hopes, succeeded to a stall in Westminster,

<P>which, as affording an occasion for leaving Mansfield,

<P>an excuse for residence in London, and an increase of

<P>income to answer the expenses of the change, was highly

<P>acceptable to those who went and those who staid.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Grant, with a temper to love and be loved, must have

<P>gone with some regret from the scenes and people she

<P>had been used to; but the same happiness of disposition

<P>must in any place, and any society, secure her a great

<P>deal to enjoy, and she had again a home to offer Mary;

<P>and Mary had had enough of her own friends, enough of vanity,

<P>ambition, love, and disappointment in the course of the

<P>last half-year, to be in need of the true kindness of her

<P>sister's heart, and the rational tranquillity of her ways.

<P>They lived together; and when Dr. Grant had brought

<P>on apoplexy and death, by three great institutionary

<P>dinners in one week, they still lived together; for Mary,

<P>though perfectly resolved against ever attaching herself

<P>to a younger brother again, was long in finding among

<P>the dashing representatives, or idle heir-apparents,

<P>who were at the command of her beauty, and her 20,000,

<P>any one who could satisfy the better taste she had acquired

<P>at Mansfield, whose character and manners could authorise

<P>a hope of the domestic happiness she had there learned

<P>to estimate, or put Edmund Bertram sufficiently out of her head.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Edmund had greatly the advantage of her in this respect.

<P>He had not to wait and wish with vacant affections for an

<P>object worthy to succeed her in them.&nbsp; Scarcely had he

<P>done regretting Mary Crawford, and observing to Fanny

<P>how impossible it was that he should ever meet with such

<P>another woman, before it began to strike him whether

<P>a very different kind of woman might not do just as well,

<P>or a great deal better:&nbsp; whether Fanny herself were not

<P>growing as dear, as important to him in all her smiles

<P>and all her ways, as Mary Crawford had ever been;

<P>and whether it might not be a possible, an hopeful

<P>undertaking to persuade her that her warm and sisterly

<P>regard for him would be foundation enough for wedded love.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I purposely abstain from dates on this occasion,

<P>that every one may be at liberty to fix their own,

<P>aware that the cure of unconquerable passions, and the

<P>transfer of unchanging attachments, must vary much as

<P>to time in different people.&nbsp; I only entreat everybody

<P>to believe that exactly at the time when it was quite

<P>natural that it should be so, and not a week earlier,

<P>Edmund did cease to care about Miss Crawford, and became

<P>as anxious to marry Fanny as Fanny herself could desire.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With such a regard for her, indeed, as his had long been,

<P>a regard founded on the most endearing claims of innocence

<P>and helplessness, and completed by every recommendation

<P>of growing worth, what could be more natural than

<P>the change?&nbsp; Loving, guiding, protecting her, as he

<P>had been doing ever since her being ten years old,

<P>her mind in so great a degree formed by his care,

<P>and her comfort depending on his kindness, an object to him

<P>of such close and peculiar interest, dearer by all his

<P>own importance with her than any one else at Mansfield,

<P>what was there now to add, but that he should learn

<P>to prefer soft light eyes to sparkling dark ones.

<P>And being always with her, and always talking confidentially,

<P>and his feelings exactly in that favourable state

<P>which a recent disappointment gives, those soft light

<P>eyes could not be very long in obtaining the pre-eminence.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Having once set out, and felt that he had done so on

<P>this road to happiness, there was nothing on the side

<P>of prudence to stop him or make his progress slow;

<P>no doubts of her deserving, no fears of opposition of taste,

<P>no need of drawing new hopes of happiness from dissimilarity

<P>of temper.&nbsp; Her mind, disposition, opinions, and habits

<P>wanted no half-concealment, no self-deception on the present,

<P>no reliance on future improvement.&nbsp; Even in the midst

<P>of his late infatuation, he had acknowledged Fanny's

<P>mental superiority.&nbsp; What must be his sense of it now,

<P>therefore?&nbsp; She was of course only too good for him;

<P>but as nobody minds having what is too good for them,

<P>he was very steadily earnest in the pursuit of the blessing,

<P>and it was not possible that encouragement from her should

<P>be long wanting.&nbsp; Timid, anxious, doubting as she was,

<P>it was still impossible that such tenderness as hers

<P>should not, at times, hold out the strongest hope of success,

<P>though it remained for a later period to tell him the whole

<P>delightful and astonishing truth.&nbsp; His happiness in knowing

<P>himself to have been so long the beloved of such a heart,

<P>must have been great enough to warrant any strength of

<P>language in which he could clothe it to her or to himself;

<P>it must have been a delightful happiness.&nbsp; But there

<P>was happiness elsewhere which no description can reach.

<P>Let no one presume to give the feelings of a young woman

<P>on receiving the assurance of that affection of which

<P>she has scarcely allowed herself to entertain a hope.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Their own inclinations ascertained, there were no

<P>difficulties behind, no drawback of poverty or parent.

<P>It was a match which Sir Thomas's wishes had even forestalled.

<P>Sick of ambitious and mercenary connexions, prizing more

<P>and more the sterling good of principle and temper,

<P>and chiefly anxious to bind by the strongest securities

<P>all that remained to him of domestic felicity, he had

<P>pondered with genuine satisfaction on the more than

<P>possibility of the two young friends finding their natural

<P>consolation in each other for all that had occurred

<P>of disappointment to either; and the joyful consent

<P>which met Edmund's application, the high sense of having

<P>realised a great acquisition in the promise of Fanny

<P>for a daughter, formed just such a contrast with his

<P>early opinion on the subject when the poor little girl's

<P>coming had been first agitated, as time is for ever

<P>producing between the plans and decisions of mortals,

<P>for their own instruction, and their neighbours' entertainment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny was indeed the daughter that he wanted.&nbsp; His charitable

<P>kindness had been rearing a prime comfort for himself.

<P>His liberality had a rich repayment, and the general

<P>goodness of his intentions by her deserved it.&nbsp; He might

<P>have made her childhood happier; but it had been an error

<P>of judgment only which had given him the appearance

<P>of harshness, and deprived him of her early love;

<P>and now, on really knowing each other, their mutual

<P>attachment became very strong.&nbsp; After settling her at

<P>Thornton Lacey with every kind attention to her comfort,

<P>the object of almost every day was to see her there,

<P>or to get her away from it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Selfishly dear as she had long been to Lady Bertram,

<P>she could not be parted with willingly by _her_.

<P>No happiness of son or niece could make her wish

<P>the marriage.&nbsp; But it was possible to part with her,

<P>because Susan remained to supply her place.

<P>Susan became the stationary niece, delighted to be so;

<P>and equally well adapted for it by a readiness of mind,

<P>and an inclination for usefulness, as Fanny had been

<P>by sweetness of temper, and strong feelings of gratitude.

<P>Susan could never be spared.&nbsp; First as a comfort to Fanny,

<P>then as an auxiliary, and last as her substitute,

<P>she was established at Mansfield, with every appearance

<P>of equal permanency.&nbsp; Her more fearless disposition

<P>and happier nerves made everything easy to her there.

<P>With quickness in understanding the tempers of those she

<P>had to deal with, and no natural timidity to restrain

<P>any consequent wishes, she was soon welcome and useful

<P>to all; and after Fanny's removal succeeded so naturally

<P>to her influence over the hourly comfort of her aunt,

<P>as gradually to become, perhaps, the most beloved of the two.

<P>In _her_ usefulness, in Fanny's excellence, in William's

<P>continued good conduct and rising fame, and in the general

<P>well-doing and success of the other members of the family,

<P>all assisting to advance each other, and doing credit

<P>to his countenance and aid, Sir Thomas saw repeated,

<P>and for ever repeated, reason to rejoice in what he had

<P>done for them all, and acknowledge the advantages of early

<P>hardship and discipline, and the consciousness of being born

<P>to struggle and endure.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With so much true merit and true love, and no want of

<P>fortune and friends, the happiness of the married cousins

<P>must appear as secure as earthly happiness can be.

<P>Equally formed for domestic life, and attached to

<P>country pleasures, their home was the home of affection

<P>and comfort; and to complete the picture of good,

<P>the acquisition of Mansfield living, by the death of

<P>Dr. Grant, occurred just after they had been married long

<P>enough to begin to want an increase of income, and feel

<P>their distance from the paternal abode an inconvenience.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>On that event they removed to Mansfield; and the Parsonage

<P>there, which, under each of its two former owners, Fanny had

<P>never been able to approach but with some painful sensation

<P>of restraint or alarm, soon grew as dear to her heart,

<P>and as thoroughly perfect in her eyes, as everything else

<P>within the view and patronage of Mansfield Park had long been.
