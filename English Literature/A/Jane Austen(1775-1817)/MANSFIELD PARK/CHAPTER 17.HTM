<P>It was, indeed, a triumphant day to Mr. Bertram and Maria.

<P>Such a victory over Edmund's discretion had been beyond

<P>their hopes, and was most delightful.&nbsp; There was no

<P>longer anything to disturb them in their darling project,

<P>and they congratulated each other in private on the

<P>jealous weakness to which they attributed the change,

<P>with all the glee of feelings gratified in every way.

<P>Edmund might still look grave, and say he did not like the

<P>scheme in general, and must disapprove the play in particular;

<P>their point was gained:&nbsp; he was to act, and he was

<P>driven to it by the force of selfish inclinations only.

<P>Edmund had descended from that moral elevation which he

<P>had maintained before, and they were both as much the better

<P>as the happier for the descent.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They behaved very well, however, to _him_ on the occasion,

<P>betraying no exultation beyond the lines about the corners

<P>of the mouth, and seemed to think it as great an escape

<P>to be quit of the intrusion of Charles Maddox, as if they

<P>had been forced into admitting him against their inclination.

<P>"To have it quite in their own family circle was what

<P>they had particularly wished.&nbsp; A stranger among them

<P>would have been the destruction of all their comfort";

<P>and when Edmund, pursuing that idea, gave a hint of his hope

<P>as to the limitation of the audience, they were ready,

<P>in the complaisance of the moment, to promise anything.

<P>It was all good-humour and encouragement.&nbsp; Mrs. Norris

<P>offered to contrive his dress, Mr. Yates assured him

<P>that Anhalt's last scene with the Baron admitted a good

<P>deal of action and emphasis, and Mr. Rushworth undertook

<P>to count his speeches.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Perhaps," said Tom, "Fanny may be more disposed to oblige

<P>us now.&nbsp; Perhaps you may persuade _her_."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, she is quite determined.&nbsp; She certainly will not act."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! very well."&nbsp; And not another word was said; but Fanny

<P>felt herself again in danger, and her indifference

<P>to the danger was beginning to fail her already.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There were not fewer smiles at the Parsonage than at the Park

<P>on this change in Edmund; Miss Crawford looked very lovely

<P>in hers, and entered with such an instantaneous renewal

<P>of cheerfulness into the whole affair as could have but

<P>one effect on him.&nbsp; "He was certainly right in respecting

<P>such feelings; he was glad he had determined on it."

<P>And the morning wore away in satisfactions very sweet,

<P>if not very sound.&nbsp; One advantage resulted from it

<P>to Fanny:&nbsp; at the earnest request of Miss Crawford,

<P>Mrs. Grant had, with her usual good-humour, agreed

<P>to undertake the part for which Fanny had been wanted;

<P>and this was all that occurred to gladden _her_ heart

<P>during the day; and even this, when imparted by Edmund,

<P>brought a pang with it, for it was Miss Crawford to

<P>whom she was obliged--it was Miss Crawford whose kind

<P>exertions were to excite her gratitude, and whose merit

<P>in making them was spoken of with a glow of admiration.

<P>She was safe; but peace and safety were unconnected here.

<P>Her mind had been never farther from peace.&nbsp; She could

<P>not feel that she had done wrong herself, but she was

<P>disquieted in every other way.&nbsp; Her heart and her judgment

<P>were equally against Edmund's decision:&nbsp; she could not

<P>acquit his unsteadiness, and his happiness under it made

<P>her wretched.&nbsp; She was full of jealousy and agitation.

<P>Miss Crawford came with looks of gaiety which seemed

<P>an insult, with friendly expressions towards herself

<P>which she could hardly answer calmly.&nbsp; Everybody around

<P>her was gay and busy, prosperous and important; each had

<P>their object of interest, their part, their dress,

<P>their favourite scene, their friends and confederates:

<P>all were finding employment in consultations and comparisons,

<P>or diversion in the playful conceits they suggested.

<P>She alone was sad and insignificant:&nbsp; she had no share

<P>in anything; she might go or stay; she might be in the

<P>midst of their noise, or retreat from it to the solitude

<P>of the East room, without being seen or missed.&nbsp; She could

<P>almost think anything would have been preferable to this.

<P>Mrs. Grant was of consequence:&nbsp; _her_ good-nature had

<P>honourable mention; her taste and her time were considered;

<P>her presence was wanted; she was sought for, and attended,

<P>and praised; and Fanny was at first in some danger

<P>of envying her the character she had accepted.

<P>But reflection brought better feelings, and shewed her

<P>that Mrs. Grant was entitled to respect, which could never

<P>have belonged to _her_; and that, had she received even

<P>the greatest, she could never have been easy in joining

<P>a scheme which, considering only her uncle, she must

<P>condemn altogether.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny's heart was not absolutely the only saddened one

<P>amongst them, as she soon began to acknowledge to herself.

<P>Julia was a sufferer too, though not quite so blamelessly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Henry Crawford had trifled with her feelings; but she

<P>had very long allowed and even sought his attentions,

<P>with a jealousy of her sister so reasonable as ought

<P>to have been their cure; and now that the conviction

<P>of his preference for Maria had been forced on her,

<P>she submitted to it without any alarm for Maria's situation,

<P>or any endeavour at rational tranquillity for herself.

<P>She either sat in gloomy silence, wrapt in such gravity

<P>as nothing could subdue, no curiosity touch, no wit amuse;

<P>or allowing the attentions of Mr. Yates, was talking with

<P>forced gaiety to him alone, and ridiculing the acting of

<P>the others.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For a day or two after the affront was given,

<P>Henry Crawford had endeavoured to do it away by the usual

<P>attack of gallantry and compliment, but he had not cared

<P>enough about it to persevere against a few repulses;

<P>and becoming soon too busy with his play to have time

<P>for more than one flirtation, he grew indifferent to

<P>the quarrel, or rather thought it a lucky occurrence,

<P>as quietly putting an end to what might ere long

<P>have raised expectations in more than Mrs. Grant.

<P>She was not pleased to see Julia excluded from the play,

<P>and sitting by disregarded; but as it was not a matter

<P>which really involved her happiness, as Henry must be the

<P>best judge of his own, and as he did assure her, with a

<P>most persuasive smile, that neither he nor Julia had ever

<P>had a serious thought of each other, she could only renew

<P>her former caution as to the elder sister, entreat him

<P>not to risk his tranquillity by too much admiration there,

<P>and then gladly take her share in anything that brought

<P>cheerfulness to the young people in general, and that did

<P>so particularly promote the pleasure of the two so dear to her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I rather wonder Julia is not in love with Henry,"

<P>was her observation to Mary.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I dare say she is," replied Mary coldly.&nbsp; "I imagine

<P>both sisters are."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Both! no, no, that must not be.&nbsp; Do not give him a hint

<P>of it.&nbsp; Think of Mr. Rushworth!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You had better tell Miss Bertram to think of Mr. Rushworth.

<P>It may do _her_ some good.&nbsp; I often think of Mr. Rushworth's

<P>property and independence, and wish them in other hands;

<P>but I never think of him.&nbsp; A man might represent the county

<P>with such an estate; a man might escape a profession

<P>and represent the county."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I dare say he _will_ be in parliament soon.&nbsp; When Sir

<P>Thomas comes, I dare say he will be in for some borough,

<P>but there has been nobody to put him in the way of doing

<P>anything yet."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Sir Thomas is to achieve many mighty things when he

<P>comes home," said Mary, after a pause.&nbsp; "Do you remember

<P>Hawkins Browne's 'Address to Tobacco,' in imitation

<P>of Pope?--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blest leaf! whose aromatic gales dispense

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To Templars modesty, to Parsons sense.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I will parody them--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blest Knight! whose dictatorial looks dispense

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To Children affluence, to Rushworth sense.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Will not that do, Mrs. Grant?&nbsp; Everything seems to depend

<P>upon Sir Thomas's return."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You will find his consequence very just and reasonable

<P>when you see him in his family, I assure you.&nbsp; I do not think

<P>we do so well without him.&nbsp; He has a fine dignified manner,

<P>which suits the head of such a house, and keeps everybody

<P>in their place.&nbsp; Lady Bertram seems more of a cipher

<P>now than when he is at home; and nobody else can keep

<P>Mrs. Norris in order.&nbsp; But, Mary, do not fancy that Maria

<P>Bertram cares for Henry.&nbsp; I am sure _Julia_ does not,

<P>or she would not have flirted as she did last night with

<P>Mr. Yates; and though he and Maria are very good friends,

<P>I think she likes Sotherton too well to be inconstant."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I would not give much for Mr. Rushworth's chance if Henry

<P>stept in before the articles were signed."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If you have such a suspicion, something must be done;

<P>and as soon as the play is all over, we will talk to him

<P>seriously and make him know his own mind; and if he

<P>means nothing, we will send him off, though he is Henry,

<P>for a time."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Julia _did_ suffer, however, though Mrs. Grant discerned

<P>it not, and though it escaped the notice of many of her

<P>own family likewise.&nbsp; She had loved, she did love still,

<P>and she had all the suffering which a warm temper and a

<P>high spirit were likely to endure under the disappointment

<P>of a dear, though irrational hope, with a strong sense

<P>of ill-usage. Her heart was sore and angry, and she

<P>was capable only of angry consolations.&nbsp; The sister

<P>with whom she was used to be on easy terms was now become

<P>her greatest enemy:&nbsp; they were alienated from each other;

<P>and Julia was not superior to the hope of some distressing

<P>end to the attentions which were still carrying on there,

<P>some punishment to Maria for conduct so shameful towards

<P>herself as well as towards Mr. Rushworth.&nbsp; With no material

<P>fault of temper, or difference of opinion, to prevent

<P>their being very good friends while their interests

<P>were the same, the sisters, under such a trial as this,

<P>had not affection or principle enough to make them merciful

<P>or just, to give them honour or compassion.&nbsp; Maria felt

<P>her triumph, and pursued her purpose, careless of Julia;

<P>and Julia could never see Maria distinguished by Henry

<P>Crawford without trusting that it would create jealousy,

<P>and bring a public disturbance at last.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny saw and pitied much of this in Julia; but there

<P>was no outward fellowship between them.&nbsp; Julia made

<P>no communication, and Fanny took no liberties.&nbsp; They were

<P>two solitary sufferers, or connected only by Fanny's consciousness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The inattention of the two brothers and the aunt to

<P>Julia's discomposure, and their blindness to its true cause,

<P>must be imputed to the fullness of their own minds.

<P>They were totally preoccupied.&nbsp; Tom was engrossed by

<P>the concerns of his theatre, and saw nothing that did

<P>not immediately relate to it.&nbsp; Edmund, between his

<P>theatrical and his real part, between Miss Crawford's

<P>claims and his own conduct, between love and consistency,

<P>was equally unobservant; and Mrs. Norris was too busy

<P>in contriving and directing the general little matters

<P>of the company, superintending their various dresses

<P>with economical expedient, for which nobody thanked her,

<P>and saving, with delighted integrity, half a crown here and

<P>there to the absent Sir Thomas, to have leisure for watching

<P>the behaviour, or guarding the happiness of his daughters.
