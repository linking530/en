<P>William's desire of seeing Fanny dance made more than a

<P>momentary impression on his uncle.&nbsp; The hope of an opportunity,

<P>which Sir Thomas had then given, was not given to be thought

<P>of no more.&nbsp; He remained steadily inclined to gratify

<P>so amiable a feeling; to gratify anybody else who might

<P>wish to see Fanny dance, and to give pleasure to the young

<P>people in general; and having thought the matter over,

<P>and taken his resolution in quiet independence,

<P>the result of it appeared the next morning at breakfast,

<P>when, after recalling and commending what his nephew

<P>had said, he added, "I do not like, William, that you

<P>should leave Northamptonshire without this indulgence.

<P>It would give me pleasure to see you both dance.

<P>You spoke of the balls at Northampton.&nbsp; Your cousins have

<P>occasionally attended them; but they would not altogether

<P>suit us now.&nbsp; The fatigue would be too much for your aunt.

<P>I believe we must not think of a Northampton ball.

<P>A dance at home would be more eligible; and if--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah, my dear Sir Thomas!" interrupted Mrs. Norris, "I knew

<P>what was coming.&nbsp; I knew what you were going to say.&nbsp; If dear

<P>Julia were at home, or dearest Mrs. Rushworth at Sotherton,

<P>to afford a reason, an occasion for such a thing, you would

<P>be tempted to give the young people a dance at Mansfield.

<P>I know you would.&nbsp; If _they_ were at home to grace

<P>the ball, a ball you would have this very Christmas.

<P>Thank your uncle, William, thank your uncle!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My daughters," replied Sir Thomas, gravely interposing,

<P>"have their pleasures at Brighton, and I hope are very happy;

<P>but the dance which I think of giving at Mansfield

<P>will be for their cousins.&nbsp; Could we be all assembled,

<P>our satisfaction would undoubtedly be more complete,

<P>but the absence of some is not to debar the others

<P>of amusement."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Norris had not another word to say.&nbsp; She saw decision

<P>in his looks, and her surprise and vexation required

<P>some minutes' silence to be settled into composure.

<P>A ball at such a time!&nbsp; His daughters absent and herself

<P>not consulted!&nbsp; There was comfort, however, soon at hand.

<P>_She_ must be the doer of everything:&nbsp; Lady Bertram

<P>would of course be spared all thought and exertion,

<P>and it would all fall upon _her_.&nbsp; She should have to do

<P>the honours of the evening; and this reflection quickly

<P>restored so much of her good-humour as enabled her to join

<P>in with the others, before their happiness and thanks were

<P>all expressed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Edmund, William, and Fanny did, in their different ways,

<P>look and speak as much grateful pleasure in the promised

<P>ball as Sir Thomas could desire.&nbsp; Edmund's feelings

<P>were for the other two.&nbsp; His father had never conferred

<P>a favour or shewn a kindness more to his satisfaction.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Lady Bertram was perfectly quiescent and contented,

<P>and had no objections to make.&nbsp; Sir Thomas engaged

<P>for its giving her very little trouble; and she assured

<P>him "that she was not at all afraid of the trouble;

<P>indeed, she could not imagine there would be any."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Norris was ready with her suggestions as to the rooms he

<P>would think fittest to be used, but found it all prearranged;

<P>and when she would have conjectured and hinted about

<P>the day, it appeared that the day was settled too.

<P>Sir Thomas had been amusing himself with shaping a very

<P>complete outline of the business; and as soon as she

<P>would listen quietly, could read his list of the families

<P>to be invited, from whom he calculated, with all necessary

<P>allowance for the shortness of the notice, to collect

<P>young people enough to form twelve or fourteen couple:

<P>and could detail the considerations which had induced

<P>him to fix on the 22nd as the most eligible day.

<P>William was required to be at Portsmouth on the 24th;

<P>the 22nd would therefore be the last day of his visit;

<P>but where the days were so few it would be unwise to fix

<P>on any earlier.&nbsp; Mrs. Norris was obliged to be satisfied

<P>with thinking just the same, and with having been on the

<P>point of proposing the 22nd herself, as by far the best day

<P>for the purpose.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The ball was now a settled thing, and before the evening

<P>a proclaimed thing to all whom it concerned.&nbsp; Invitations were

<P>sent with despatch, and many a young lady went to bed that

<P>night with her head full of happy cares as well as Fanny.

<P>To her the cares were sometimes almost beyond the happiness;

<P>for young and inexperienced, with small means of choice

<P>and no confidence in her own taste, the "how she

<P>should be dressed" was a point of painful solicitude;

<P>and the almost solitary ornament in her possession,

<P>a very pretty amber cross which William had brought

<P>her from Sicily, was the greatest distress of all,

<P>for she had nothing but a bit of ribbon to fasten it to;

<P>and though she had worn it in that manner once, would it

<P>be allowable at such a time in the midst of all the rich

<P>ornaments which she supposed all the other young ladies

<P>would appear in?&nbsp; And yet not to wear it!&nbsp; William had

<P>wanted to buy her a gold chain too, but the purchase had

<P>been beyond his means, and therefore not to wear the cross

<P>might be mortifying him.&nbsp; These were anxious considerations;

<P>enough to sober her spirits even under the prospect

<P>of a ball given principally for her gratification.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The preparations meanwhile went on, and Lady Bertram continued

<P>to sit on her sofa without any inconvenience from them.

<P>She had some extra visits from the housekeeper, and her

<P>maid was rather hurried in making up a new dress for her:

<P>Sir Thomas gave orders, and Mrs. Norris ran about;

<P>but all this gave _her_ no trouble, and as she had foreseen,

<P>"there was, in fact, no trouble in the business."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Edmund was at this time particularly full of cares:

<P>his mind being deeply occupied in the consideration of two

<P>important events now at hand, which were to fix his fate

<P>in life--ordination and matrimony--events of such a serious

<P>character as to make the ball, which would be very quickly

<P>followed by one of them, appear of less moment in his

<P>eyes than in those of any other person in the house.

<P>On the 23rd he was going to a friend near Peterborough,

<P>in the same situation as himself, and they were to

<P>receive ordination in the course of the Christmas week.

<P>Half his destiny would then be determined, but the other

<P>half might not be so very smoothly wooed.&nbsp; His duties would

<P>be established, but the wife who was to share, and animate,

<P>and reward those duties, might yet be unattainable.

<P>He knew his own mind, but he was not always perfectly assured

<P>of knowing Miss Crawford's. There were points on which they

<P>did not quite agree; there were moments in which she did

<P>not seem propitious; and though trusting altogether to

<P>her affection, so far as to be resolved--almost resolved--

<P>on bringing it to a decision within a very short time,

<P>as soon as the variety of business before him were arranged,

<P>and he knew what he had to offer her, he had many

<P>anxious feelings, many doubting hours as to the result.

<P>His conviction of her regard for him was sometimes very strong;

<P>he could look back on a long course of encouragement,

<P>and she was as perfect in disinterested attachment as

<P>in everything else.&nbsp; But at other times doubt and alarm

<P>intermingled with his hopes; and when he thought of her

<P>acknowledged disinclination for privacy and retirement,

<P>her decided preference of a London life, what could he expect

<P>but a determined rejection? unless it were an acceptance

<P>even more to be deprecated, demanding such sacrifices

<P>of situation and employment on his side as conscience

<P>must forbid.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The issue of all depended on one question.&nbsp; Did she

<P>love him well enough to forego what had used to be

<P>essential points?&nbsp; Did she love him well enough to make

<P>them no longer essential?&nbsp; And this question, which he

<P>was continually repeating to himself, though oftenest

<P>answered with a "Yes," had sometimes its "No."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Miss Crawford was soon to leave Mansfield, and on this

<P>circumstance the "no" and the "yes" had been very recently

<P>in alternation.&nbsp; He had seen her eyes sparkle as she spoke

<P>of the dear friend's letter, which claimed a long visit from

<P>her in London, and of the kindness of Henry, in engaging

<P>to remain where he was till January, that he might convey

<P>her thither; he had heard her speak of the pleasure of such

<P>a journey with an animation which had "no" in every tone.

<P>But this had occurred on the first day of its being settled,

<P>within the first hour of the burst of such enjoyment,

<P>when nothing but the friends she was to visit was before her.

<P>He had since heard her express herself differently,

<P>with other feelings, more chequered feelings:&nbsp; he had heard

<P>her tell Mrs. Grant that she should leave her with regret;

<P>that she began to believe neither the friends nor

<P>the pleasures she was going to were worth those she

<P>left behind; and that though she felt she must go,

<P>and knew she should enjoy herself when once away, she was

<P>already looking forward to being at Mansfield again.

<P>Was there not a "yes" in all this?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With such matters to ponder over, and arrange, and re-arrange,

<P>Edmund could not, on his own account, think very much

<P>of the evening which the rest of the family were looking

<P>forward to with a more equal degree of strong interest.

<P>Independent of his two cousins' enjoyment in it,

<P>the evening was to him of no higher value than any

<P>other appointed meeting of the two families might be.

<P>In every meeting there was a hope of receiving farther

<P>confirmation of Miss Crawford's attachment; but the whirl

<P>of a ballroom, perhaps, was not particularly favourable

<P>to the excitement or expression of serious feelings.

<P>To engage her early for the two first dances was all the

<P>command of individual happiness which he felt in his power,

<P>and the only preparation for the ball which he could

<P>enter into, in spite of all that was passing around him

<P>on the subject, from morning till night.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Thursday was the day of the ball; and on Wednesday

<P>morning Fanny, still unable to satisfy herself as to what

<P>she ought to wear, determined to seek the counsel of the

<P>more enlightened, and apply to Mrs. Grant and her sister,

<P>whose acknowledged taste would certainly bear her blameless;

<P>and as Edmund and William were gone to Northampton,

<P>and she had reason to think Mr. Crawford likewise out,

<P>she walked down to the Parsonage without much fear of wanting

<P>an opportunity for private discussion; and the privacy of

<P>such a discussion was a most important part of it to Fanny,

<P>being more than half-ashamed of her own solicitude.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She met Miss Crawford within a few yards of the Parsonage,

<P>just setting out to call on her, and as it seemed to her

<P>that her friend, though obliged to insist on turning back,

<P>was unwilling to lose her walk, she explained her business

<P>at once, and observed, that if she would be so kind

<P>as to give her opinion, it might be all talked over as

<P>well without doors as within.&nbsp; Miss Crawford appeared

<P>gratified by the application, and after a moment's thought,

<P>urged Fanny's returning with her in a much more cordial

<P>manner than before, and proposed their going up into

<P>her room, where they might have a comfortable coze,

<P>without disturbing Dr. and Mrs. Grant, who were together

<P>in the drawing-room. It was just the plan to suit Fanny;

<P>and with a great deal of gratitude on her side for such ready

<P>and kind attention, they proceeded indoors, and upstairs,

<P>and were soon deep in the interesting subject.&nbsp; Miss Crawford,

<P>pleased with the appeal, gave her all her best judgment

<P>and taste, made everything easy by her suggestions,

<P>and tried to make everything agreeable by her encouragement.

<P>The dress being settled in all its grander parts--

<P>"But what shall you have by way of necklace?" said Miss

<P>Crawford.&nbsp; "Shall not you wear your brother's cross?"

<P>And as she spoke she was undoing a small parcel,

<P>which Fanny had observed in her hand when they met.

<P>Fanny acknowledged her wishes and doubts on this point:

<P>she did not know how either to wear the cross, or to

<P>refrain from wearing it.&nbsp; She was answered by having

<P>a small trinket-box placed before her, and being requested

<P>to chuse from among several gold chains and necklaces.

<P>Such had been the parcel with which Miss Crawford

<P>was provided, and such the object of her intended visit:

<P>and in the kindest manner she now urged Fanny's taking one

<P>for the cross and to keep for her sake, saying everything

<P>she could think of to obviate the scruples which were

<P>making Fanny start back at first with a look of horror at

<P>the proposal.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You see what a collection I have," said she; "more by half

<P>than I ever use or think of.&nbsp; I do not offer them as new.

<P>I offer nothing but an old necklace.&nbsp; You must forgive

<P>the liberty, and oblige me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny still resisted, and from her heart.&nbsp; The gift was

<P>too valuable.&nbsp; But Miss Crawford persevered, and argued

<P>the case with so much affectionate earnestness through

<P>all the heads of William and the cross, and the ball,

<P>and herself, as to be finally successful.&nbsp; Fanny found

<P>herself obliged to yield, that she might not be accused

<P>of pride or indifference, or some other littleness;

<P>and having with modest reluctance given her consent,

<P>proceeded to make the selection.&nbsp; She looked and looked,

<P>longing to know which might be least valuable; and was

<P>determined in her choice at last, by fancying there was

<P>one necklace more frequently placed before her eyes than

<P>the rest.&nbsp; It was of gold, prettily worked; and though Fanny

<P>would have preferred a longer and a plainer chain as more

<P>adapted for her purpose, she hoped, in fixing on this,

<P>to be chusing what Miss Crawford least wished to keep.

<P>Miss Crawford smiled her perfect approbation; and hastened

<P>to complete the gift by putting the necklace round her,

<P>and making her see how well it looked.&nbsp; Fanny had not a

<P>word to say against its becomingness, and, excepting what

<P>remained of her scruples, was exceedingly pleased with an

<P>acquisition so very apropos.&nbsp; She would rather, perhaps,

<P>have been obliged to some other person.&nbsp; But this was

<P>an unworthy feeling.&nbsp; Miss Crawford had anticipated her

<P>wants with a kindness which proved her a real friend.

<P>"When I wear this necklace I shall always think of you,"

<P>said she, "and feel how very kind you were."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You must think of somebody else too, when you wear

<P>that necklace," replied Miss Crawford.&nbsp; "You must think

<P>of Henry, for it was his choice in the first place.

<P>He gave it to me, and with the necklace I make over

<P>to you all the duty of remembering the original giver.

<P>It is to be a family remembrancer.&nbsp; The sister is not to be

<P>in your mind without bringing the brother too."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny, in great astonishment and confusion, would have

<P>returned the present instantly.&nbsp; To take what had

<P>been the gift of another person, of a brother too,

<P>impossible! it must not be! and with an eagerness and

<P>embarrassment quite diverting to her companion, she laid

<P>down the necklace again on its cotton, and seemed resolved

<P>either to take another or none at all.&nbsp; Miss Crawford

<P>thought she had never seen a prettier consciousness.

<P>"My dear child," said she, laughing, "what are you afraid of?

<P>Do you think Henry will claim the necklace as mine,

<P>and fancy you did not come honestly by it? or are you

<P>imagining he would be too much flattered by seeing

<P>round your lovely throat an ornament which his money

<P>purchased three years ago, before he knew there was such

<P>a throat in the world? or perhaps"--looking archly--

<P>"you suspect a confederacy between us, and that what

<P>I am now doing is with his knowledge and at his desire?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With the deepest blushes Fanny protested against such

<P>a thought.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, then," replied Miss Crawford more seriously,

<P>but without at all believing her, "to convince me that you

<P>suspect no trick, and are as unsuspicious of compliment

<P>as I have always found you, take the necklace and say

<P>no more about it.&nbsp; Its being a gift of my brother's need

<P>not make the smallest difference in your accepting it,

<P>as I assure you it makes none in my willingness to part

<P>with it.&nbsp; He is always giving me something or other.

<P>I have such innumerable presents from him that it is quite

<P>impossible for me to value or for him to remember half.

<P>And as for this necklace, I do not suppose I have worn it

<P>six times:&nbsp; it is very pretty, but I never think of it;

<P>and though you would be most heartily welcome to any

<P>other in my trinket-box, you have happened to fix on

<P>the very one which, if I have a choice, I would rather

<P>part with and see in your possession than any other.

<P>Say no more against it, I entreat you.&nbsp; Such a trifle is

<P>not worth half so many words."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny dared not make any farther opposition; and with

<P>renewed but less happy thanks accepted the necklace again,

<P>for there was an expression in Miss Crawford's eyes

<P>which she could not be satisfied with.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was impossible for her to be insensible of Mr. Crawford's

<P>change of manners.&nbsp; She had long seen it.&nbsp; He evidently

<P>tried to please her:&nbsp; he was gallant, he was attentive,

<P>he was something like what he had been to her cousins:

<P>he wanted, she supposed, to cheat her of her tranquillity

<P>as he had cheated them; and whether he might not have some

<P>concern in this necklace--she could not be convinced that

<P>he had not, for Miss Crawford, complaisant as a sister,

<P>was careless as a woman and a friend.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Reflecting and doubting, and feeling that the possession

<P>of what she had so much wished for did not bring much

<P>satisfaction, she now walked home again, with a change rather

<P>than a diminution of cares since her treading that path before.
