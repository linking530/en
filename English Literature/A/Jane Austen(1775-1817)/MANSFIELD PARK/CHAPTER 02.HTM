<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>The little girl performed her long journey in safety;

<P>and at Northampton was met by Mrs. Norris, who thus

<P>regaled in the credit of being foremost to welcome her,

<P>and in the importance of leading her in to the others,

<P>and recommending her to their kindness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny Price was at this time just ten years old,

<P>and though there might not be much in her first appearance

<P>to captivate, there was, at least, nothing to disgust

<P>her relations.&nbsp; She was small of her age, with no

<P>glow of complexion, nor any other striking beauty;

<P>exceedingly timid and shy, and shrinking from notice;

<P>but her air, though awkward, was not vulgar, her voice

<P>was sweet, and when she spoke her countenance was pretty.

<P>Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram received her very kindly;

<P>and Sir Thomas, seeing how much she needed encouragement,

<P>tried to be all that was conciliating:&nbsp; but he had

<P>to work against a most untoward gravity of deportment;

<P>and Lady Bertram, without taking half so much trouble,

<P>or speaking one word where he spoke ten, by the mere aid

<P>of a good-humoured smile, became immediately the less awful

<P>character of the two.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The young people were all at home, and sustained their

<P>share in the introduction very well, with much good humour,

<P>and no embarrassment, at least on the part of the sons, who,

<P>at seventeen and sixteen, and tall of their age, had all

<P>the grandeur of men in the eyes of their little cousin.

<P>The two girls were more at a loss from being younger

<P>and in greater awe of their father, who addressed them

<P>on the occasion with rather an injudicious particularity.

<P>But they were too much used to company and praise to have

<P>anything like natural shyness; and their confidence

<P>increasing from their cousin's total want of it,

<P>they were soon able to take a full survey of her face

<P>and her frock in easy indifference.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They were a remarkably fine family, the sons very well-looking,

<P>the daughters decidedly handsome, and all of them well-grown

<P>and forward of their age, which produced as striking

<P>a difference between the cousins in person, as education

<P>had given to their address; and no one would have supposed

<P>the girls so nearly of an age as they really were.&nbsp; There were

<P>in fact but two years between the youngest and Fanny.

<P>Julia Bertram was only twelve, and Maria but a year older.

<P>The little visitor meanwhile was as unhappy as possible.

<P>Afraid of everybody, ashamed of herself, and longing

<P>for the home she had left, she knew not how to look up,

<P>and could scarcely speak to be heard, or without crying.

<P>Mrs. Norris had been talking to her the whole way from

<P>Northampton of her wonderful good fortune, and the

<P>extraordinary degree of gratitude and good behaviour

<P>which it ought to produce, and her consciousness of

<P>misery was therefore increased by the idea of its being

<P>a wicked thing for her not to be happy.&nbsp; The fatigue,

<P>too, of so long a journey, became soon no trifling evil.

<P>In vain were the well-meant condescensions of Sir Thomas,

<P>and all the officious prognostications of Mrs. Norris

<P>that she would be a good girl; in vain did Lady Bertram

<P>smile and make her sit on the sofa with herself and pug,

<P>and vain was even the sight of a gooseberry tart towards

<P>giving her comfort; she could scarcely swallow two mouthfuls

<P>before tears interrupted her, and sleep seeming to be her

<P>likeliest friend, she was taken to finish her sorrows in bed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This is not a very promising beginning," said Mrs. Norris,

<P>when Fanny had left the room.&nbsp; "After all that I said to her

<P>as we came along, I thought she would have behaved better;

<P>I told her how much might depend upon her acquitting

<P>herself well at first.&nbsp; I wish there may not be a little

<P>sulkiness of temper--her poor mother had a good deal;

<P>but we must make allowances for such a child--and I

<P>do not know that her being sorry to leave her home is

<P>really against her, for, with all its faults, it _was_

<P>her home, and she cannot as yet understand how much she

<P>has changed for the better; but then there is moderation

<P>in all things."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It required a longer time, however, than Mrs. Norris

<P>was inclined to allow, to reconcile Fanny to the novelty

<P>of Mansfield Park, and the separation from everybody

<P>she had been used to.&nbsp; Her feelings were very acute,

<P>and too little understood to be properly attended to.

<P>Nobody meant to be unkind, but nobody put themselves out

<P>of their way to secure her comfort.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The holiday allowed to the Miss Bertrams the next day,

<P>on purpose to afford leisure for getting acquainted with,

<P>and entertaining their young cousin, produced little union.

<P>They could not but hold her cheap on finding that she

<P>had but two sashes, and had never learned French; and when

<P>they perceived her to be little struck with the duet they

<P>were so good as to play, they could do no more than make

<P>her a generous present of some of their least valued toys,

<P>and leave her to herself, while they adjourned to whatever

<P>might be the favourite holiday sport of the moment,

<P>making artificial flowers or wasting gold paper.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny, whether near or from her cousins, whether in

<P>the schoolroom, the drawing-room, or the shrubbery,

<P>was equally forlorn, finding something to fear in

<P>every person and place.&nbsp; She was disheartened by Lady

<P>Bertram's silence, awed by Sir Thomas's grave looks,

<P>and quite overcome by Mrs. Norris's admonitions.

<P>Her elder cousins mortified her by reflections on her size,

<P>and abashed her by noticing her shyness:&nbsp; Miss Lee

<P>wondered at her ignorance, and the maid-servants sneered

<P>at her clothes; and when to these sorrows was added the idea

<P>of the brothers and sisters among whom she had always

<P>been important as playfellow, instructress, and nurse,

<P>the despondence that sunk her little heart was severe.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The grandeur of the house astonished, but could not console her.

<P>The rooms were too large for her to move in with ease:

<P>whatever she touched she expected to injure, and she

<P>crept about in constant terror of something or other;

<P>often retreating towards her own chamber to cry;

<P>and the little girl who was spoken of in the drawing-room

<P>when she left it at night as seeming so desirably sensible

<P>of her peculiar good fortune, ended every day's sorrows

<P>by sobbing herself to sleep.&nbsp; A week had passed in this way,

<P>and no suspicion of it conveyed by her quiet passive manner,

<P>when she was found one morning by her cousin Edmund,

<P>the youngest of the sons, sitting crying on the attic stairs.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear little cousin," said he, with all the gentleness

<P>of an excellent nature, "what can be the matter?"&nbsp; And sitting

<P>down by her, he was at great pains to overcome her shame

<P>in being so surprised, and persuade her to speak openly.

<P>"Was she ill? or was anybody angry with her? or had she

<P>quarrelled with Maria and Julia? or was she puzzled

<P>about anything in her lesson that he could explain?

<P>Did she, in short, want anything he could possibly get her,

<P>or do for her?&nbsp; For a long while no answer could be

<P>obtained beyond a "no, no--not at all--no, thank you";

<P>but he still persevered; and no sooner had he begun to

<P>revert to her own home, than her increased sobs explained

<P>to him where the grievance lay.&nbsp; He tried to console her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are sorry to leave Mama, my dear little Fanny,"

<P>said he, "which shows you to be a very good girl; but you

<P>must remember that you are with relations and friends,

<P>who all love you, and wish to make you happy.&nbsp; Let us walk

<P>out in the park, and you shall tell me all about your

<P>brothers and sisters."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>On pursuing the subject, he found that, dear as all

<P>these brothers and sisters generally were, there was one

<P>among them who ran more in her thoughts than the rest.

<P>It was William whom she talked of most, and wanted most

<P>to see.&nbsp; William, the eldest, a year older than herself,

<P>her constant companion and friend; her advocate with her

<P>mother (of whom he was the darling) in every distress.

<P>"William did not like she should come away; he had told

<P>her he should miss her very much indeed."&nbsp; "But William will

<P>write to you, I dare say."&nbsp; "Yes, he had promised he would,

<P>but he had told _her_ to write first."&nbsp; "And when shall

<P>you do it?"&nbsp; She hung her head and answered hesitatingly,

<P>"she did not know; she had not any paper."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If that be all your difficulty, I will furnish you

<P>with paper and every other material, and you may write

<P>your letter whenever you choose.&nbsp; Would it make you

<P>happy to write to William?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, very."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then let it be done now.&nbsp; Come with me into the

<P>breakfast-room, we shall find everything there,

<P>and be sure of having the room to ourselves."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But, cousin, will it go to the post?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, depend upon me it shall:&nbsp; it shall go with the

<P>other letters; and, as your uncle will frank it,

<P>it will cost William nothing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My uncle!" repeated Fanny, with a frightened look.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, when you have written the letter, I will take it

<P>to my father to frank."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny thought it a bold measure, but offered no further

<P>resistance; and they went together into the breakfast-room,

<P>where Edmund prepared her paper, and ruled her lines

<P>with all the goodwill that her brother could himself

<P>have felt, and probably with somewhat more exactness.

<P>He continued with her the whole time of her writing,

<P>to assist her with his penknife or his orthography,

<P>as either were wanted; and added to these attentions,

<P>which she felt very much, a kindness to her brother which

<P>delighted her beyond all the rest.&nbsp; He wrote with his own

<P>hand his love to his cousin William, and sent him half

<P>a guinea under the seal.&nbsp; Fanny's feelings on the occasion

<P>were such as she believed herself incapable of expressing;

<P>but her countenance and a few artless words fully

<P>conveyed all their gratitude and delight, and her cousin

<P>began to find her an interesting object.&nbsp; He talked

<P>to her more, and, from all that she said, was convinced

<P>of her having an affectionate heart, and a strong desire

<P>of doing right; and he could perceive her to be farther

<P>entitled to attention by great sensibility of her situation,

<P>and great timidity.&nbsp; He had never knowingly given her pain,

<P>but he now felt that she required more positive kindness;

<P>and with that view endeavoured, in the first place,

<P>to lessen her fears of them all, and gave her especially

<P>a great deal of good advice as to playing with Maria

<P>and Julia, and being as merry as possible.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>From this day Fanny grew more comfortable.&nbsp; She felt

<P>that she had a friend, and the kindness of her cousin

<P>Edmund gave her better spirits with everybody else.

<P>The place became less strange, and the people less formidable;

<P>and if there were some amongst them whom she could not

<P>cease to fear, she began at least to know their ways,

<P>and to catch the best manner of conforming to them.

<P>The little rusticities and awkwardnesses which had at

<P>first made grievous inroads on the tranquillity of all,

<P>and not least of herself, necessarily wore away, and she

<P>was no longer materially afraid to appear before her uncle,

<P>nor did her aunt Norris's voice make her start very much.

<P>To her cousins she became occasionally an acceptable companion.

<P>Though unworthy, from inferiority of age and strength,

<P>to be their constant associate, their pleasures and schemes

<P>were sometimes of a nature to make a third very useful,

<P>especially when that third was of an obliging,

<P>yielding temper; and they could not but own, when their

<P>aunt inquired into her faults, or their brother Edmund

<P>urged her claims to their kindness, that "Fanny was

<P>good-natured enough."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Edmund was uniformly kind himself; and she had nothing

<P>worse to endure on the part of Tom than that sort

<P>of merriment which a young man of seventeen will always

<P>think fair with a child of ten.&nbsp; He was just entering

<P>into life, full of spirits, and with all the liberal

<P>dispositions of an eldest son, who feels born only

<P>for expense and enjoyment.&nbsp; His kindness to his little

<P>cousin was consistent with his situation and rights:

<P>he made her some very pretty presents, and laughed at her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As her appearance and spirits improved, Sir Thomas and Mrs. Norris

<P>thought with greater satisfaction of their benevolent plan;

<P>and it was pretty soon decided between them that,

<P>though far from clever, she showed a tractable disposition,

<P>and seemed likely to give them little trouble.&nbsp; A mean

<P>opinion of her abilities was not confined to _them_.

<P>Fanny could read, work, and write, but she had been taught

<P>nothing more; and as her cousins found her ignorant

<P>of many things with which they had been long familiar,

<P>they thought her prodigiously stupid, and for the first

<P>two or three weeks were continually bringing some fresh

<P>report of it into the drawing-room. "Dear mama, only think,

<P>my cousin cannot put the map of Europe together--

<P>or my cousin cannot tell the principal rivers in Russia--

<P>or, she never heard of Asia Minor--or she does not know

<P>the difference between water-colours and crayons!--

<P>How strange!--Did you ever hear anything so stupid?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear," their considerate aunt would reply,

<P>"it is very bad, but you must not expect everybody

<P>to be as forward and quick at learning as yourself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But, aunt, she is really so very ignorant!--Do you know,

<P>we asked her last night which way she would go to get

<P>to Ireland; and she said, she should cross to the Isle

<P>of Wight.&nbsp; She thinks of nothing but the Isle of Wight,

<P>and she calls it _the_ _Island_, as if there were no

<P>other island in the world.&nbsp; I am sure I should have been

<P>ashamed of myself, if I had not known better long before I

<P>was so old as she is.&nbsp; I cannot remember the time when I

<P>did not know a great deal that she has not the least

<P>notion of yet.&nbsp; How long ago it is, aunt, since we used

<P>to repeat the chronological order of the kings of England,

<P>with the dates of their accession, and most of the principal

<P>events of their reigns!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes," added the other; "and of the Roman emperors

<P>as low as Severus; besides a great deal of the heathen

<P>mythology, and all the metals, semi-metals, planets,

<P>and distinguished philosophers."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very true indeed, my dears, but you are blessed with

<P>wonderful memories, and your poor cousin has probably none

<P>at all.&nbsp; There is a vast deal of difference in memories,

<P>as well as in everything else, and therefore you must

<P>make allowance for your cousin, and pity her deficiency.

<P>And remember that, if you are ever so forward and clever

<P>yourselves, you should always be modest; for, much as you

<P>know already, there is a great deal more for you to learn."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, I know there is, till I am seventeen.&nbsp; But I must

<P>tell you another thing of Fanny, so odd and so stupid.

<P>Do you know, she says she does not want to learn either

<P>music or drawing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"To be sure, my dear, that is very stupid indeed,

<P>and shows a great want of genius and emulation.

<P>But, all things considered, I do not know whether it is

<P>not as well that it should be so, for, though you know

<P>(owing to me) your papa and mama are so good as to bring

<P>her up with you, it is not at all necessary that she

<P>should be as accomplished as you are;--on the contrary,

<P>it is much more desirable that there should be a difference."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Such were the counsels by which Mrs. Norris assisted to form

<P>her nieces' minds; and it is not very wonderful that,

<P>with all their promising talents and early information,

<P>they should be entirely deficient in the less common

<P>acquirements of self-knowledge, generosity and humility.

<P>In everything but disposition they were admirably taught.

<P>Sir Thomas did not know what was wanting, because, though a

<P>truly anxious father, he was not outwardly affectionate,

<P>and the reserve of his manner repressed all the flow of their

<P>spirits before him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To the education of her daughters Lady Bertram paid not

<P>the smallest attention.&nbsp; She had not time for such cares.

<P>She was a woman who spent her days in sitting, nicely dressed,

<P>on a sofa, doing some long piece of needlework, of little use

<P>and no beauty, thinking more of her pug than her children,

<P>but very indulgent to the latter when it did not put

<P>herself to inconvenience, guided in everything important

<P>by Sir Thomas, and in smaller concerns by her sister.

<P>Had she possessed greater leisure for the service of her girls,

<P>she would probably have supposed it unnecessary, for they

<P>were under the care of a governess, with proper masters,

<P>and could want nothing more.&nbsp; As for Fanny's being stupid

<P>at learning, "she could only say it was very unlucky,

<P>but some people _were_ stupid, and Fanny must take more pains:

<P>she did not know what else was to be done; and, except her

<P>being so dull, she must add she saw no harm in the poor

<P>little thing, and always found her very handy and quick

<P>in carrying messages, and fetching, what she wanted."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny, with all her faults of ignorance and timidity,

<P>was fixed at Mansfield Park, and learning to transfer

<P>in its favour much of her attachment to her former home,

<P>grew up there not unhappily among her cousins.&nbsp; There was

<P>no positive ill-nature in Maria or Julia; and though

<P>Fanny was often mortified by their treatment of her,

<P>she thought too lowly of her own claims to feel injured

<P>by it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>From about the time of her entering the family,

<P>Lady Bertram, in consequence of a little ill-health,

<P>and a great deal of indolence, gave up the house in town,

<P>which she had been used to occupy every spring,

<P>and remained wholly in the country, leaving Sir Thomas

<P>to attend his duty in Parliament, with whatever increase

<P>or diminution of comfort might arise from her absence.

<P>In the country, therefore, the Miss Bertrams continued

<P>to exercise their memories, practise their duets, and grow

<P>tall and womanly:&nbsp; and their father saw them becoming

<P>in person, manner, and accomplishments, everything that

<P>could satisfy his anxiety.&nbsp; His eldest son was careless

<P>and extravagant, and had already given him much uneasiness;

<P>but his other children promised him nothing but good.

<P>His daughters, he felt, while they retained the name

<P>of Bertram, must be giving it new grace, and in quitting it,

<P>he trusted, would extend its respectable alliances;

<P>and the character of Edmund, his strong good sense

<P>and uprightness of mind, bid most fairly for utility,

<P>honour, and happiness to himself and all his connexions.

<P>He was to be a clergyman.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Amid the cares and the complacency which his own

<P>children suggested, Sir Thomas did not forget to do what

<P>he could for the children of Mrs. Price:&nbsp; he assisted

<P>her liberally in the education and disposal of her sons

<P>as they became old enough for a determinate pursuit;

<P>and Fanny, though almost totally separated from her family,

<P>was sensible of the truest satisfaction in hearing of any

<P>kindness towards them, or of anything at all promising

<P>in their situation or conduct.&nbsp; Once, and once only,

<P>in the course of many years, had she the happiness

<P>of being with William.&nbsp; Of the rest she saw nothing:

<P>nobody seemed to think of her ever going amongst them again,

<P>even for a visit, nobody at home seemed to want her;

<P>but William determining, soon after her removal,

<P>to be a sailor, was invited to spend a week with his

<P>sister in Northamptonshire before he went to sea.

<P>Their eager affection in meeting, their exquisite

<P>delight in being together, their hours of happy mirth,

<P>and moments of serious conference, may be imagined;

<P>as well as the sanguine views and spirits of the boy even

<P>to the last, and the misery of the girl when he left her.

<P>Luckily the visit happened in the Christmas holidays,

<P>when she could directly look for comfort to her cousin Edmund;

<P>and he told her such charming things of what William was

<P>to do, and be hereafter, in consequence of his profession,

<P>as made her gradually admit that the separation might

<P>have some use.&nbsp; Edmund's friendship never failed her:

<P>his leaving Eton for Oxford made no change in his kind

<P>dispositions, and only afforded more frequent opportunities

<P>of proving them.&nbsp; Without any display of doing more than

<P>the rest, or any fear of doing too much, he was always

<P>true to her interests, and considerate of her feelings,

<P>trying to make her good qualities understood, and to conquer

<P>the diffidence which prevented their being more apparent;

<P>giving her advice, consolation, and encouragement.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Kept back as she was by everybody else, his single support

<P>could not bring her forward; but his attentions were otherwise

<P>of the highest importance in assisting the improvement

<P>of her mind, and extending its pleasures.&nbsp; He knew her to

<P>be clever, to have a quick apprehension as well as good sense,

<P>and a fondness for reading, which, properly directed,

<P>must be an education in itself.&nbsp; Miss Lee taught her French,

<P>and heard her read the daily portion of history; but he

<P>recommended the books which charmed her leisure hours,

<P>he encouraged her taste, and corrected her judgment:

<P>he made reading useful by talking to her of what she read,

<P>and heightened its attraction by judicious praise.

<P>In return for such services she loved him better than

<P>anybody in the world except William:&nbsp; her heart was divided

<P>between the two.
