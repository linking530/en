<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>About thirty years ago Miss Maria Ward, of Huntingdon,

<P>with only seven thousand pounds, had the good luck

<P>to captivate Sir Thomas Bertram, of Mansfield Park,

<P>in the county of Northampton, and to be thereby raised

<P>to the rank of a baronet's lady, with all the comforts

<P>and consequences of an handsome house and large income.

<P>All Huntingdon exclaimed on the greatness of the match,

<P>and her uncle, the lawyer, himself, allowed her to be at least

<P>three thousand pounds short of any equitable claim to it.

<P>She had two sisters to be benefited by her elevation;

<P>and such of their acquaintance as thought Miss Ward and Miss

<P>Frances quite as handsome as Miss Maria, did not scruple

<P>to predict their marrying with almost equal advantage.

<P>But there certainly are not so many men of large fortune

<P>in the world as there are pretty women to deserve them.

<P>Miss Ward, at the end of half a dozen years, found

<P>herself obliged to be attached to the Rev. Mr. Norris,

<P>a friend of her brother-in-law, with scarcely any

<P>private fortune, and Miss Frances fared yet worse.

<P>Miss Ward's match, indeed, when it came to the point,

<P>was not contemptible:&nbsp; Sir Thomas being happily able

<P>to give his friend an income in the living of Mansfield;

<P>and Mr. and Mrs. Norris began their career of conjugal

<P>felicity with very little less than a thousand a year.

<P>But Miss Frances married, in the common phrase,

<P>to disoblige her family, and by fixing on a lieutenant

<P>of marines, without education, fortune, or connexions,

<P>did it very thoroughly.&nbsp; She could hardly have made

<P>a more untoward choice.&nbsp; Sir Thomas Bertram had interest,

<P>which, from principle as well as pride--from a general

<P>wish of doing right, and a desire of seeing all that were

<P>connected with him in situations of respectability,

<P>he would have been glad to exert for the advantage

<P>of Lady Bertram's sister; but her husband's profession

<P>was such as no interest could reach; and before he

<P>had time to devise any other method of assisting them,

<P>an absolute breach between the sisters had taken place.

<P>It was the natural result of the conduct of each party,

<P>and such as a very imprudent marriage almost always produces.

<P>To save herself from useless remonstrance, Mrs. Price never

<P>wrote to her family on the subject till actually married.

<P>Lady Bertram, who was a woman of very tranquil feelings,

<P>and a temper remarkably easy and indolent, would have

<P>contented herself with merely giving up her sister,

<P>and thinking no more of the matter; but Mrs. Norris

<P>had a spirit of activity, which could not be satisfied

<P>till she had written a long and angry letter to Fanny,

<P>to point out the folly of her conduct, and threaten

<P>her with all its possible ill consequences.&nbsp; Mrs. Price,

<P>in her turn, was injured and angry; and an answer,

<P>which comprehended each sister in its bitterness, and bestowed

<P>such very disrespectful reflections on the pride of Sir

<P>Thomas as Mrs. Norris could not possibly keep to herself,

<P>put an end to all intercourse between them for a considerable

<P>period.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Their homes were so distant, and the circles in which they

<P>moved so distinct, as almost to preclude the means of ever

<P>hearing of each other's existence during the eleven

<P>following years, or, at least, to make it very wonderful

<P>to Sir Thomas that Mrs. Norris should ever have it

<P>in her power to tell them, as she now and then did,

<P>in an angry voice, that Fanny had got another child.

<P>By the end of eleven years, however, Mrs. Price could no

<P>longer afford to cherish pride or resentment, or to lose one

<P>connexion that might possibly assist her.&nbsp; A large and still

<P>increasing family, an husband disabled for active service,

<P>but not the less equal to company and good liquor, and a

<P>very small income to supply their wants, made her eager

<P>to regain the friends she had so carelessly sacrificed;

<P>and she addressed Lady Bertram in a letter which spoke

<P>so much contrition and despondence, such a superfluity

<P>of children, and such a want of almost everything else,

<P>as could not but dispose them all to a reconciliation.

<P>She was preparing for her ninth lying-in; and after

<P>bewailing the circumstance, and imploring their countenance

<P>as sponsors to the expected child, she could not conceal

<P>how important she felt they might be to the future

<P>maintenance of the eight already in being.&nbsp; Her eldest

<P>was a boy of ten years old, a fine spirited fellow,

<P>who longed to be out in the world; but what could she do?

<P>Was there any chance of his being hereafter useful to Sir

<P>Thomas in the concerns of his West Indian property?

<P>No situation would be beneath him; or what did Sir Thomas

<P>think of Woolwich? or how could a boy be sent out to

<P>the East?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The letter was not unproductive.&nbsp; It re-established

<P>peace and kindness.&nbsp; Sir Thomas sent friendly

<P>advice and professions, Lady Bertram dispatched

<P>money and baby-linen, and Mrs. Norris wrote the letters.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Such were its immediate effects, and within a twelvemonth

<P>a more important advantage to Mrs. Price resulted from it.

<P>Mrs. Norris was often observing to the others that she

<P>could not get her poor sister and her family out of

<P>her head, and that, much as they had all done for her,

<P>she seemed to be wanting to do more; and at length she

<P>could not but own it to be her wish that poor Mrs. Price

<P>should be relieved from the charge and expense of one child

<P>entirely out of her great number.&nbsp; "What if they were

<P>among them to undertake the care of her eldest daughter,

<P>a girl now nine years old, of an age to require more

<P>attention than her poor mother could possibly give?

<P>The trouble and expense of it to them would be nothing,

<P>compared with the benevolence of the action."&nbsp; Lady Bertram

<P>agreed with her instantly.&nbsp; "I think we cannot do better,"

<P>said she; "let us send for the child."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sir Thomas could not give so instantaneous and unqualified

<P>a consent.&nbsp; He debated and hesitated;--it was a serious charge;--

<P>a girl so brought up must be adequately provided for,

<P>or there would be cruelty instead of kindness in taking

<P>her from her family.&nbsp; He thought of his own four children,

<P>of his two sons, of cousins in love, etc.;--but no sooner

<P>had he deliberately begun to state his objections,

<P>than Mrs. Norris interrupted him with a reply to them all,

<P>whether stated or not.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear Sir Thomas, I perfectly comprehend you, and do

<P>justice to the generosity and delicacy of your notions,

<P>which indeed are quite of a piece with your general conduct;

<P>and I entirely agree with you in the main as to the propriety

<P>of doing everything one could by way of providing for a

<P>child one had in a manner taken into one's own hands;

<P>and I am sure I should be the last person in the world to

<P>withhold my mite upon such an occasion.&nbsp; Having no children

<P>of my own, who should I look to in any little matter I

<P>may ever have to bestow, but the children of my sisters?--

<P>and I am sure Mr. Norris is too just--but you know I am

<P>a woman of few words and professions.&nbsp; Do not let us

<P>be frightened from a good deed by a trifle.&nbsp; Give a girl

<P>an education, and introduce her properly into the world,

<P>and ten to one but she has the means of settling well,

<P>without farther expense to anybody.&nbsp; A niece of ours,

<P>Sir Thomas, I may say, or at least of_yours_, would not

<P>grow up in this neighbourhood without many advantages.

<P>I don't say she would be so handsome as her cousins.

<P>I dare say she would not; but she would be introduced into

<P>the society of this country under such very favourable

<P>circumstances as, in all human probability, would get her

<P>a creditable establishment.&nbsp; You are thinking of your sons--

<P>but do not you know that, of all things upon earth,

<P>_that_ is the least likely to happen, brought up as they

<P>would be, always together like brothers and sisters?

<P>It is morally impossible.&nbsp; I never knew an instance of it.

<P>It is, in fact, the only sure way of providing against

<P>the connexion.&nbsp; Suppose her a pretty girl, and seen by Tom

<P>or Edmund for the first time seven years hence, and I dare

<P>say there would be mischief.&nbsp; The very idea of her having

<P>been suffered to grow up at a distance from us all in poverty

<P>and neglect, would be enough to make either of the dear,

<P>sweet-tempered boys in love with her.&nbsp; But breed her up

<P>with them from this time, and suppose her even to have the

<P>beauty of an angel, and she will never be more to either than

<P>a sister."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There is a great deal of truth in what you say,"

<P>replied Sir Thomas, "and far be it from me to throw any

<P>fanciful impediment in the way of a plan which would be

<P>so consistent with the relative situations of each.&nbsp; I only

<P>meant to observe that it ought not to be lightly engaged in,

<P>and that to make it really serviceable to Mrs. Price,

<P>and creditable to ourselves, we must secure to the child,

<P>or consider ourselves engaged to secure to her hereafter,

<P>as circumstances may arise, the provision of a gentlewoman,

<P>if no such establishment should offer as you are so sanguine

<P>in expecting."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I thoroughly understand you," cried Mrs. Norris,

<P>"you are everything that is generous and considerate,

<P>and I am sure we shall never disagree on this point.

<P>Whatever I can do, as you well know, I am always ready

<P>enough to do for the good of those I love; and, though I

<P>could never feel for this little girl the hundredth

<P>part of the regard I bear your own dear children,

<P>nor consider her, in any respect, so much my own,

<P>I should hate myself if I were capable of neglecting her.

<P>Is not she a sister's child? and could I bear to see

<P>her want while I had a bit of bread to give her?

<P>My dear Sir Thomas, with all my faults I have a warm heart;

<P>and, poor as I am, would rather deny myself the necessaries

<P>of life than do an ungenerous thing.&nbsp; So, if you are not

<P>against it, I will write to my poor sister tomorrow,

<P>and make the proposal; and, as soon as matters are settled,

<P>_I_ will engage to get the child to Mansfield; _you_ shall

<P>have no trouble about it.&nbsp; My own trouble, you know,

<P>I never regard.&nbsp; I will send Nanny to London on purpose,

<P>and she may have a bed at her cousin the saddler's, and the

<P>child be appointed to meet her there.&nbsp; They may easily get

<P>her from Portsmouth to town by the coach, under the care

<P>of any creditable person that may chance to be going.

<P>I dare say there is always some reputable tradesman's wife

<P>or other going up."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Except to the attack on Nanny's cousin, Sir Thomas no longer

<P>made any objection, and a more respectable, though less

<P>economical rendezvous being accordingly substituted,

<P>everything was considered as settled, and the pleasures

<P>of so benevolent a scheme were already enjoyed.

<P>The division of gratifying sensations ought not,

<P>in strict justice, to have been equal; for Sir Thomas was

<P>fully resolved to be the real and consistent patron of the

<P>selected child, and Mrs. Norris had not the least intention

<P>of being at any expense whatever in her maintenance.

<P>As far as walking, talking, and contriving reached,

<P>she was thoroughly benevolent, and nobody knew better

<P>how to dictate liberality to others; but her love of money

<P>was equal to her love of directing, and she knew quite as

<P>well how to save her own as to spend that of her friends.

<P>Having married on a narrower income than she had been

<P>used to look forward to, she had, from the first,

<P>fancied a very strict line of economy necessary;

<P>and what was begun as a matter of prudence, soon grew

<P>into a matter of choice, as an object of that needful

<P>solicitude which there were no children to supply.

<P>Had there been a family to provide for, Mrs. Norris might

<P>never have saved her money; but having no care of that kind,

<P>there was nothing to impede her frugality, or lessen the

<P>comfort of making a yearly addition to an income which they

<P>had never lived up to.&nbsp; Under this infatuating principle,

<P>counteracted by no real affection for her sister,

<P>it was impossible for her to aim at more than the credit

<P>of projecting and arranging so expensive a charity;

<P>though perhaps she might so little know herself as to

<P>walk home to the Parsonage, after this conversation,

<P>in the happy belief of being the most liberal-minded

<P>sister and aunt in the world.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>When the subject was brought forward again, her views

<P>were more fully explained; and, in reply to Lady Bertram's

<P>calm inquiry of "Where shall the child come to first,

<P>sister, to you or to us?"&nbsp; Sir Thomas heard with some

<P>surprise that it would be totally out of Mrs. Norris's

<P>power to take any share in the personal charge of her.

<P>He had been considering her as a particularly welcome

<P>addition at the Parsonage, as a desirable companion

<P>to an aunt who had no children of her own; but he found

<P>himself wholly mistaken.&nbsp; Mrs. Norris was sorry to say

<P>that the little girl's staying with them, at least

<P>as things then were, was quite out of the question.

<P>Poor Mr. Norris's indifferent state of health made it

<P>an impossibility:&nbsp; he could no more bear the noise of a child

<P>than he could fly; if, indeed, he should ever get well

<P>of his gouty complaints, it would be a different matter:

<P>she should then be glad to take her turn, and think nothing

<P>of the inconvenience; but just now, poor Mr. Norris

<P>took up every moment of her time, and the very mention

<P>of such a thing she was sure would distract him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then she had better come to us," said Lady Bertram,

<P>with the utmost composure.&nbsp; After a short pause Sir Thomas

<P>added with dignity, "Yes, let her home be in this house.

<P>We will endeavour to do our duty by her, and she will,

<P>at least, have the advantage of companions of her own age,

<P>and of a regular instructress."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very true," cried Mrs. Norris, "which are both very

<P>important considerations; and it will be just the same

<P>to Miss Lee whether she has three girls to teach,

<P>or only two--there can be no difference.&nbsp; I only wish I

<P>could be more useful; but you see I do all in my power.

<P>I am not one of those that spare their own trouble;

<P>and Nanny shall fetch her, however it may put me

<P>to inconvenience to have my chief counsellor away for

<P>three days.&nbsp; I suppose, sister, you will put the child

<P>in the little white attic, near the old nurseries.

<P>It will be much the best place for her, so near Miss Lee,

<P>and not far from the girls, and close by the housemaids,

<P>who could either of them help to dress her, you know,

<P>and take care of her clothes, for I suppose you would not

<P>think it fair to expect Ellis to wait on her as well as

<P>the others.&nbsp; Indeed, I do not see that you could possibly

<P>place her anywhere else."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Lady Bertram made no opposition.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I hope she will prove a well-disposed girl,"

<P>continued Mrs. Norris, "and be sensible of her uncommon

<P>good fortune in having such friends."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Should her disposition be really bad," said Sir Thomas,

<P>"we must not, for our own children's sake, continue her

<P>in the family; but there is no reason to expect so great

<P>an evil.&nbsp; We shall probably see much to wish altered

<P>in her, and must prepare ourselves for gross ignorance,

<P>some meanness of opinions, and very distressing vulgarity

<P>of manner; but these are not incurable faults; nor, I trust,

<P>can they be dangerous for her associates.&nbsp; Had my daughters

<P>been _younger_ than herself, I should have considered

<P>the introduction of such a companion as a matter of very

<P>serious moment; but, as it is, I hope there can be nothing

<P>to fear for _them_, and everything to hope for _her_,

<P>from the association."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That is exactly what I think," cried Mrs. Norris,

<P>"and what I was saying to my husband this morning.

<P>It will be an education for the child, said I, only being

<P>with her cousins; if Miss Lee taught her nothing, she would

<P>learn to be good and clever from _them_."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I hope she will not tease my poor pug," said Lady Bertram;

<P>"I have but just got Julia to leave it alone."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There will be some difficulty in our way, Mrs. Norris,"

<P>observed Sir Thomas, "as to the distinction proper to be made

<P>between the girls as they grow up:&nbsp; how to preserve in the

<P>minds of my _daughters_ the consciousness of what they are,

<P>without making them think too lowly of their cousin;

<P>and how, without depressing her spirits too far,

<P>to make her remember that she is not a _Miss Bertram_.

<P>I should wish to see them very good friends, and would,

<P>on no account, authorise in my girls the smallest degree

<P>of arrogance towards their relation; but still they cannot

<P>be equals.&nbsp; Their rank, fortune, rights, and expectations

<P>will always be different.&nbsp; It is a point of great delicacy,

<P>and you must assist us in our endeavours to choose exactly

<P>the right line of conduct."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Norris was quite at his service; and though she

<P>perfectly agreed with him as to its being a most

<P>difficult thing, encouraged him to hope that between

<P>them it would be easily managed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It will be readily believed that Mrs. Norris did not write

<P>to her sister in vain.&nbsp; Mrs. Price seemed rather surprised

<P>that a girl should be fixed on, when she had so many fine boys,

<P>but accepted the offer most thankfully, assuring them of her

<P>daughter's being a very well-disposed, good-humoured girl,

<P>and trusting they would never have cause to throw her off.

<P>She spoke of her farther as somewhat delicate and puny,

<P>but was sanguine in the hope of her being materially better

<P>for change of air.&nbsp; Poor woman! she probably thought

<P>change of air might agree with many of her children.
