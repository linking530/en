<P>On reaching home Fanny went immediately upstairs to

<P>deposit this unexpected acquisition, this doubtful good

<P>of a necklace, in some favourite box in the East room,

<P>which held all her smaller treasures; but on opening

<P>the door, what was her surprise to find her cousin Edmund

<P>there writing at the table!&nbsp; Such a sight having never

<P>occurred before, was almost as wonderful as it was welcome.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Fanny," said he directly, leaving his seat and his pen,

<P>and meeting her with something in his hand, "I beg

<P>your pardon for being here.&nbsp; I came to look for you,

<P>and after waiting a little while in hope of your coming in,

<P>was making use of your inkstand to explain my errand.

<P>You will find the beginning of a note to yourself;

<P>but I can now speak my business, which is merely to beg

<P>your acceptance of this little trifle--a chain for

<P>William's cross.&nbsp; You ought to have had it a week ago,

<P>but there has been a delay from my brother's not

<P>being in town by several days so soon as I expected;

<P>and I have only just now received it at Northampton.

<P>I hope you will like the chain itself, Fanny.&nbsp; I endeavoured

<P>to consult the simplicity of your taste; but, at any rate,

<P>I know you will be kind to my intentions, and consider it,

<P>as it really is, a token of the love of one of your

<P>oldest friends."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And so saying, he was hurrying away, before Fanny,

<P>overpowered by a thousand feelings of pain and pleasure,

<P>could attempt to speak; but quickened by one sovereign wish,

<P>she then called out, "Oh! cousin, stop a moment,

<P>pray stop!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He turned back.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I cannot attempt to thank you," she continued, in a

<P>very agitated manner; "thanks are out of the question.

<P>I feel much more than I can possibly express.

<P>Your goodness in thinking of me in such a way is beyond--

<P>"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If that is all you have to say, Fanny" smiling and turning

<P>away again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, no, it is not.&nbsp; I want to consult you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Almost unconsciously she had now undone the parcel he

<P>had just put into her hand, and seeing before her,

<P>in all the niceness of jewellers' packing, a plain

<P>gold chain, perfectly simple and neat, she could not help

<P>bursting forth again, "Oh, this is beautiful indeed!

<P>This is the very thing, precisely what I wished for!

<P>This is the only ornament I have ever had a desire to possess.

<P>It will exactly suit my cross.&nbsp; They must and shall be

<P>worn together.&nbsp; It comes, too, in such an acceptable moment.

<P>Oh, cousin, you do not know how acceptable it is."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear Fanny, you feel these things a great deal too much.

<P>I am most happy that you like the chain, and that it

<P>should be here in time for to-morrow; but your thanks are

<P>far beyond the occasion.&nbsp; Believe me, I have no pleasure

<P>in the world superior to that of contributing to yours.

<P>No, I can safely say, I have no pleasure so complete,

<P>so unalloyed.&nbsp; It is without a drawback."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Upon such expressions of affection Fanny could have

<P>lived an hour without saying another word; but Edmund,

<P>after waiting a moment, obliged her to bring down her

<P>mind from its heavenly flight by saying, "But what is it

<P>that you want to consult me about?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was about the necklace, which she was now most earnestly

<P>longing to return, and hoped to obtain his approbation

<P>of her doing.&nbsp; She gave the history of her recent visit,

<P>and now her raptures might well be over; for Edmund was so

<P>struck with the circumstance, so delighted with what Miss

<P>Crawford had done, so gratified by such a coincidence

<P>of conduct between them, that Fanny could not but admit

<P>the superior power of one pleasure over his own mind,

<P>though it might have its drawback.&nbsp; It was some time

<P>before she could get his attention to her plan, or any

<P>answer to her demand of his opinion:&nbsp; he was in a reverie

<P>of fond reflection, uttering only now and then a few

<P>half-sentences of praise; but when he did awake and understand,

<P>he was very decided in opposing what she wished.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Return the necklace!&nbsp; No, my dear Fanny, upon no account.

<P>It would be mortifying her severely.&nbsp; There can hardly

<P>be a more unpleasant sensation than the having anything

<P>returned on our hands which we have given with a reasonable

<P>hope of its contributing to the comfort of a friend.

<P>Why should she lose a pleasure which she has shewn herself

<P>so deserving of?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If it had been given to me in the first instance,"

<P>said Fanny, "I should not have thought of returning it;

<P>but being her brother's present, is not it fair to suppose

<P>that she would rather not part with it, when it is

<P>not wanted?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She must not suppose it not wanted, not acceptable,

<P>at least:&nbsp; and its having been originally her brother's

<P>gift makes no difference; for as she was not prevented

<P>from offering, nor you from taking it on that account,

<P>it ought not to prevent you from keeping it.&nbsp; No doubt it

<P>is handsomer than mine, and fitter for a ballroom."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, it is not handsomer, not at all handsomer

<P>in its way, and, for my purpose, not half so fit.

<P>The chain will agree with William's cross beyond

<P>all comparison better than the necklace."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"For one night, Fanny, for only one night, if it _be_

<P>a sacrifice; I am sure you will, upon consideration,

<P>make that sacrifice rather than give pain to one who has been

<P>so studious of your comfort.&nbsp; Miss Crawford's attentions

<P>to you have been--not more than you were justly entitled to--

<P>I am the last person to think that _could_ _be_,

<P>but they have been invariable; and to be returning them

<P>with what must have something the _air_ of ingratitude,

<P>though I know it could never have the _meaning_, is not

<P>in your nature, I am sure.&nbsp; Wear the necklace, as you

<P>are engaged to do, to-morrow evening, and let the chain,

<P>which was not ordered with any reference to the ball,

<P>be kept for commoner occasions.&nbsp; This is my advice.

<P>I would not have the shadow of a coolness between the two whose

<P>intimacy I have been observing with the greatest pleasure,

<P>and in whose characters there is so much general resemblance

<P>in true generosity and natural delicacy as to make the few

<P>slight differences, resulting principally from situation,

<P>no reasonable hindrance to a perfect friendship.&nbsp; I would

<P>not have the shadow of a coolness arise," he repeated,

<P>his voice sinking a little, "between the two dearest objects

<P>I have on earth."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He was gone as he spoke; and Fanny remained to tranquillise

<P>herself as she could.&nbsp; She was one of his two dearest--

<P>that must support her.&nbsp; But the other:&nbsp; the first!

<P>She had never heard him speak so openly before, and though

<P>it told her no more than what she had long perceived,

<P>it was a stab, for it told of his own convictions and views.

<P>They were decided.&nbsp; He would marry Miss Crawford.

<P>It was a stab, in spite of every long-standing expectation;

<P>and she was obliged to repeat again and again, that she

<P>was one of his two dearest, before the words gave

<P>her any sensation.&nbsp; Could she believe Miss Crawford to

<P>deserve him, it would be--oh, how different would it be--

<P>how far more tolerable!&nbsp; But he was deceived in her:

<P>he gave her merits which she had not; her faults were

<P>what they had ever been, but he saw them no longer.

<P>Till she had shed many tears over this deception,

<P>Fanny could not subdue her agitation; and the dejection

<P>which followed could only be relieved by the influence of

<P>fervent prayers for his happiness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was her intention, as she felt it to be her duty,

<P>to try to overcome all that was excessive, all that

<P>bordered on selfishness, in her affection for Edmund.

<P>To call or to fancy it a loss, a disappointment, would be

<P>a presumption for which she had not words strong enough to

<P>satisfy her own humility.&nbsp; To think of him as Miss Crawford

<P>might be justified in thinking, would in her be insanity.

<P>To her he could be nothing under any circumstances;

<P>nothing dearer than a friend.&nbsp; Why did such an idea occur

<P>to her even enough to be reprobated and forbidden?&nbsp; It ought

<P>not to have touched on the confines of her imagination.

<P>She would endeavour to be rational, and to deserve

<P>the right of judging of Miss Crawford's character,

<P>and the privilege of true solicitude for him by a sound

<P>intellect and an honest heart.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She had all the heroism of principle, and was determined

<P>to do her duty; but having also many of the feelings of youth

<P>and nature, let her not be much wondered at, if, after making

<P>all these good resolutions on the side of self-government,

<P>she seized the scrap of paper on which Edmund had begun

<P>writing to her, as a treasure beyond all her hopes,

<P>and reading with the tenderest emotion these words,

<P>"My very dear Fanny, you must do me the favour to accept"

<P>locked it up with the chain, as the dearest part of the gift.

<P>It was the only thing approaching to a letter which she

<P>had ever received from him; she might never receive another;

<P>it was impossible that she ever should receive another

<P>so perfectly gratifying in the occasion and the style.

<P>Two lines more prized had never fallen from the pen

<P>of the most distinguished author--never more completely

<P>blessed the researches of the fondest biographer.

<P>The enthusiasm of a woman's love is even beyond

<P>the biographer's. To her, the handwriting itself,

<P>independent of anything it may convey, is a blessedness.

<P>Never were such characters cut by any other human being

<P>as Edmund's commonest handwriting gave!&nbsp; This specimen,

<P>written in haste as it was, had not a fault; and there

<P>was a felicity in the flow of the first four words,

<P>in the arrangement of "My very dear Fanny," which she

<P>could have looked at for ever.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Having regulated her thoughts and comforted her feelings

<P>by this happy mixture of reason and weakness, she was able

<P>in due time to go down and resume her usual employments

<P>near her aunt Bertram, and pay her the usual observances

<P>without any apparent want of spirits.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Thursday, predestined to hope and enjoyment, came; and opened

<P>with more kindness to Fanny than such self-willed,

<P>unmanageable days often volunteer, for soon after breakfast

<P>a very friendly note was brought from Mr. Crawford

<P>to William, stating that as he found himself obliged

<P>to go to London on the morrow for a few days, he could

<P>not help trying to procure a companion; and therefore

<P>hoped that if William could make up his mind to leave

<P>Mansfield half a day earlier than had been proposed,

<P>he would accept a place in his carriage.&nbsp; Mr. Crawford meant

<P>to be in town by his uncle's accustomary late dinner-hour,

<P>and William was invited to dine with him at the Admiral's.

<P>The proposal was a very pleasant one to William himself,

<P>who enjoyed the idea of travelling post with four horses,

<P>and such a good-humoured, agreeable friend; and, in likening

<P>it to going up with despatches, was saying at once everything

<P>in favour of its happiness and dignity which his imagination

<P>could suggest; and Fanny, from a different motive,

<P>was exceedingly pleased; for the original plan was that

<P>William should go up by the mail from Northampton the

<P>following night, which would not have allowed him an hour's

<P>rest before he must have got into a Portsmouth coach;

<P>and though this offer of Mr. Crawford's would rob her

<P>of many hours of his company, she was too happy in having

<P>William spared from the fatigue of such a journey,

<P>to think of anything else.&nbsp; Sir Thomas approved of it

<P>for another reason.&nbsp; His nephew's introduction to Admiral

<P>Crawford might be of service.&nbsp; The Admiral, he believed,

<P>had interest.&nbsp; Upon the whole, it was a very joyous note.

<P>Fanny's spirits lived on it half the morning, deriving

<P>some accession of pleasure from its writer being himself to go

<P>away.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As for the ball, so near at hand, she had too many

<P>agitations and fears to have half the enjoyment in

<P>anticipation which she ought to have had, or must have

<P>been supposed to have by the many young ladies looking

<P>forward to the same event in situations more at ease,

<P>but under circumstances of less novelty, less interest,

<P>less peculiar gratification, than would be attributed

<P>to her.&nbsp; Miss Price, known only by name to half the

<P>people invited, was now to make her first appearance,

<P>and must be regarded as the queen of the evening.

<P>Who could be happier than Miss Price?&nbsp; But Miss Price

<P>had not been brought up to the trade of _coming_ _out_;

<P>and had she known in what light this ball was, in general,

<P>considered respecting her, it would very much have lessened

<P>her comfort by increasing the fears she already had of doing

<P>wrong and being looked at.&nbsp; To dance without much observation

<P>or any extraordinary fatigue, to have strength and partners

<P>for about half the evening, to dance a little with Edmund,

<P>and not a great deal with Mr. Crawford, to see William

<P>enjoy himself, and be able to keep away from her aunt Norris,

<P>was the height of her ambition, and seemed to comprehend

<P>her greatest possibility of happiness.&nbsp; As these were

<P>the best of her hopes, they could not always prevail;

<P>and in the course of a long morning, spent principally

<P>with her two aunts, she was often under the influence

<P>of much less sanguine views.&nbsp; William, determined to

<P>make this last day a day of thorough enjoyment,

<P>was out snipe-shooting; Edmund, she had too much reason

<P>to suppose, was at the Parsonage; and left alone to bear

<P>the worrying of Mrs. Norris, who was cross because the

<P>housekeeper would have her own way with the supper,

<P>and whom _she_ could not avoid though the housekeeper might,

<P>Fanny was worn down at last to think everything an evil

<P>belonging to the ball, and when sent off with a parting worry

<P>to dress, moved as languidly towards her own room, and felt

<P>as incapable of happiness as if she had been allowed no share in

<P>it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As she walked slowly upstairs she thought of yesterday;

<P>it had been about the same hour that she had returned

<P>from the Parsonage, and found Edmund in the East room.

<P>"Suppose I were to find him there again to-day!" said she

<P>to herself, in a fond indulgence of fancy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Fanny," said a voice at that moment near her.

<P>Starting and looking up, she saw, across the lobby she

<P>had just reached, Edmund himself, standing at the head

<P>of a different staircase.&nbsp; He came towards her.&nbsp; "You look

<P>tired and fagged, Fanny.&nbsp; You have been walking too far."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, I have not been out at all."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then you have had fatigues within doors, which are worse.

<P>You had better have gone out."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny, not liking to complain, found it easiest to make

<P>no answer; and though he looked at her with his usual kindness,

<P>she believed he had soon ceased to think of her countenance.

<P>He did not appear in spirits:&nbsp; something unconnected with

<P>her was probably amiss.&nbsp; They proceeded upstairs together,

<P>their rooms being on the same floor above.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I come from Dr. Grant's," said Edmund presently.

<P>"You may guess my errand there, Fanny."&nbsp; And he looked

<P>so conscious, that Fanny could think but of one errand,

<P>which turned her too sick for speech.&nbsp; "I wished to

<P>engage Miss Crawford for the two first dances," was the

<P>explanation that followed, and brought Fanny to life again,

<P>enabling her, as she found she was expected to speak,

<P>to utter something like an inquiry as to the result.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes," he answered, "she is engaged to me; but" (with a smile

<P>that did not sit easy) "she says it is to be the last time

<P>that she ever will dance with me.&nbsp; She is not serious.

<P>I think, I hope, I am sure she is not serious; but I would

<P>rather not hear it.&nbsp; She never has danced with a clergyman,

<P>she says, and she never _will_.&nbsp; For my own sake, I could

<P>wish there had been no ball just at--I mean not this

<P>very week, this very day; to-morrow I leave home."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny struggled for speech, and said, "I am very sorry

<P>that anything has occurred to distress you.&nbsp; This ought

<P>to be a day of pleasure.&nbsp; My uncle meant it so."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh yes, yes! and it will be a day of pleasure.

<P>It will all end right.&nbsp; I am only vexed for a moment.

<P>In fact, it is not that I consider the ball as ill-timed;

<P>what does it signify?&nbsp; But, Fanny," stopping her,

<P>by taking her hand, and speaking low and seriously,

<P>"you know what all this means.&nbsp; You see how it is;

<P>and could tell me, perhaps better than I could tell you,

<P>how and why I am vexed.&nbsp; Let me talk to you a little.

<P>You are a kind, kind listener.&nbsp; I have been pained

<P>by her manner this morning, and cannot get the better

<P>of it.&nbsp; I know her disposition to be as sweet and

<P>faultless as your own, but the influence of her former

<P>companions makes her seem--gives to her conversation,

<P>to her professed opinions, sometimes a tinge of wrong.

<P>She does not _think_ evil, but she speaks it, speaks it

<P>in playfulness; and though I know it to be playfulness,

<P>it grieves me to the soul."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The effect of education," said Fanny gently.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Edmund could not but agree to it.&nbsp; "Yes, that uncle and aunt!

<P>They have injured the finest mind; for sometimes,

<P>Fanny, I own to you, it does appear more than manner:

<P>it appears as if the mind itself was tainted."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny imagined this to be an appeal to her judgment,

<P>and therefore, after a moment's consideration, said, "If you

<P>only want me as a listener, cousin, I will be as useful

<P>as I can; but I am not qualified for an adviser.

<P>Do not ask advice of _me_.&nbsp; I am not competent."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are right, Fanny, to protest against such an office,

<P>but you need not be afraid.&nbsp; It is a subject on which I

<P>should never ask advice; it is the sort of subject on

<P>which it had better never be asked; and few, I imagine,

<P>do ask it, but when they want to be influenced against

<P>their conscience.&nbsp; I only want to talk to you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"One thing more.&nbsp; Excuse the liberty; but take care

<P>_how_ you talk to me.&nbsp; Do not tell me anything now,

<P>which hereafter you may be sorry for.&nbsp; The time may come--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The colour rushed into her cheeks as she spoke.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dearest Fanny!" cried Edmund, pressing her hand to

<P>his lips with almost as much warmth as if it had been

<P>Miss Crawford's, "you are all considerate thought!

<P>But it is unnecessary here.&nbsp; The time will never come.

<P>No such time as you allude to will ever come.&nbsp; I begin to

<P>think it most improbable:&nbsp; the chances grow less and less;

<P>and even if it should, there will be nothing to be

<P>remembered by either you or me that we need be afraid of,

<P>for I can never be ashamed of my own scruples; and if they

<P>are removed, it must be by changes that will only raise

<P>her character the more by the recollection of the faults

<P>she once had.&nbsp; You are the only being upon earth to whom

<P>I should say what I have said; but you have always known

<P>my opinion of her; you can bear me witness, Fanny, that I

<P>have never been blinded.&nbsp; How many a time have we

<P>talked over her little errors!&nbsp; You need not fear me;

<P>I have almost given up every serious idea of her;

<P>but I must be a blockhead indeed, if, whatever befell me,

<P>I could think of your kindness and sympathy without the

<P>sincerest gratitude."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He had said enough to shake the experience of eighteen.

<P>He had said enough to give Fanny some happier feelings

<P>than she had lately known, and with a brighter look,

<P>she answered, "Yes, cousin, I am convinced that _you_

<P>would be incapable of anything else, though perhaps some

<P>might not.&nbsp; I cannot be afraid of hearing anything you

<P>wish to say.&nbsp; Do not check yourself.&nbsp; Tell me whatever

<P>you like."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They were now on the second floor, and the appearance

<P>of a housemaid prevented any farther conversation.

<P>For Fanny's present comfort it was concluded, perhaps,

<P>at the happiest moment:&nbsp; had he been able to talk another

<P>five minutes, there is no saying that he might not have talked

<P>away all Miss Crawford's faults and his own despondence.

<P>But as it was, they parted with looks on his side of

<P>grateful affection, and with some very precious sensations

<P>on hers.&nbsp; She had felt nothing like it for hours.

<P>Since the first joy from Mr. Crawford's note to William had

<P>worn away, she had been in a state absolutely the reverse;

<P>there had been no comfort around, no hope within her.

<P>Now everything was smiling.&nbsp; William's good fortune

<P>returned again upon her mind, and seemed of greater

<P>value than at first.&nbsp; The ball, too--such an evening

<P>of pleasure before her!&nbsp; It was now a real animation;

<P>and she began to dress for it with much of the happy

<P>flutter which belongs to a ball.&nbsp; All went well:

<P>she did not dislike her own looks; and when she came

<P>to the necklaces again, her good fortune seemed complete,

<P>for upon trial the one given her by Miss Crawford would

<P>by no means go through the ring of the cross.&nbsp; She had,

<P>to oblige Edmund, resolved to wear it; but it was too

<P>large for the purpose.&nbsp; His, therefore, must be worn;

<P>and having, with delightful feelings, joined the chain

<P>and the cross--those memorials of the two most beloved

<P>of her heart, those dearest tokens so formed for each

<P>other by everything real and imaginary--and put them

<P>round her neck, and seen and felt how full of William

<P>and Edmund they were, she was able, without an effort,

<P>to resolve on wearing Miss Crawford's necklace too.

<P>She acknowledged it to be right.&nbsp; Miss Crawford had a claim;

<P>and when it was no longer to encroach on, to interfere

<P>with the stronger claims, the truer kindness of another,

<P>she could do her justice even with pleasure to herself.

<P>The necklace really looked very well; and Fanny left her

<P>room at last, comfortably satisfied with herself and all

<P>about her.

<P>Her aunt Bertram had recollected her on this occasion with

<P>an unusual degree of wakefulness.&nbsp; It had really occurred

<P>to her, unprompted, that Fanny, preparing for a ball,

<P>might be glad of better help than the upper housemaid's,

<P>and when dressed herself, she actually sent her own maid

<P>to assist her; too late, of course, to be of any use.

<P>Mrs. Chapman had just reached the attic floor, when Miss

<P>Price came out of her room completely dressed, and only

<P>civilities were necessary; but Fanny felt her aunt's

<P>attention almost as much as Lady Bertram or Mrs. Chapman

<P>could do themselves.
