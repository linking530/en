<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>The Honourable John Yates, this new friend, had not much

<P>to recommend him beyond habits of fashion and expense,

<P>and being the younger son of a lord with a tolerable

<P>independence; and Sir Thomas would probably have thought

<P>his introduction at Mansfield by no means desirable.

<P>Mr. Bertram's acquaintance with him had begun at Weymouth,

<P>where they had spent ten days together in the same society,

<P>and the friendship, if friendship it might be called,

<P>had been proved and perfected by Mr. Yates's being invited

<P>to take Mansfield in his way, whenever he could, and by his

<P>promising to come; and he did come rather earlier than had

<P>been expected, in consequence of the sudden breaking-up

<P>of a large party assembled for gaiety at the house

<P>of another friend, which he had left Weymouth to join.

<P>He came on the wings of disappointment, and with his head

<P>full of acting, for it had been a theatrical party;

<P>and the play in which he had borne a part was within

<P>two days of representation, when the sudden death

<P>of one of the nearest connexions of the family had

<P>destroyed the scheme and dispersed the performers.

<P>To be so near happiness, so near fame, so near the long

<P>paragraph in praise of the private theatricals at Ecclesford,

<P>the seat of the Right Hon. Lord Ravenshaw, in Cornwall,

<P>which would of course have immortalised the whole party

<P>for at least a twelvemonth! and being so near, to lose

<P>it all, was an injury to be keenly felt, and Mr. Yates

<P>could talk of nothing else.&nbsp; Ecclesford and its theatre,

<P>with its arrangements and dresses, rehearsals and jokes,

<P>was his never-failing subject, and to boast of the past his

<P>only consolation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Happily for him, a love of the theatre is so general,

<P>an itch for acting so strong among young people, that he

<P>could hardly out-talk the interest of his hearers.

<P>From the first casting of the parts to the epilogue

<P>it was all bewitching, and there were few who did

<P>not wish to have been a party concerned, or would have

<P>hesitated to try their skill.&nbsp; The play had been Lovers'

<P>Vows, and Mr. Yates was to have been Count Cassel.

<P>"A trifling part," said he, "and not at all to my taste,

<P>and such a one as I certainly would not accept again;

<P>but I was determined to make no difficulties.

<P>Lord Ravenshaw and the duke had appropriated the only two

<P>characters worth playing before I reached Ecclesford;

<P>and though Lord Ravenshaw offered to resign his to me,

<P>it was impossible to take it, you know.&nbsp; I was sorry

<P>for _him_ that he should have so mistaken his powers,

<P>for he was no more equal to the Baron--a little man

<P>with a weak voice, always hoarse after the first

<P>ten minutes.&nbsp; It must have injured the piece materially;

<P>but _I_ was resolved to make no difficulties.

<P>Sir Henry thought the duke not equal to Frederick,

<P>but that was because Sir Henry wanted the part himself;

<P>whereas it was certainly in the best hands of the two.

<P>I was surprised to see Sir Henry such a stick.

<P>Luckily the strength of the piece did not depend upon him.

<P>Our Agatha was inimitable, and the duke was thought very great

<P>by many.&nbsp; And upon the whole, it would certainly have gone

<P>off wonderfully."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It was a hard case, upon my word"; and, "I do think you

<P>were very much to be pitied," were the kind responses

<P>of listening sympathy.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is not worth complaining about; but to be sure the

<P>poor old dowager could not have died at a worse time;

<P>and it is impossible to help wishing that the news could

<P>have been suppressed for just the three days we wanted.

<P>It was but three days; and being only a grandmother,

<P>and all happening two hundred miles off, I think there would

<P>have been no great harm, and it was suggested, I know;

<P>but Lord Ravenshaw, who I suppose is one of the most correct

<P>men in England, would not hear of it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"An afterpiece instead of a comedy," said Mr. Bertram.

<P>"Lovers' Vows were at an end, and Lord and Lady Ravenshaw

<P>left to act My Grandmother by themselves.&nbsp; Well, the jointure

<P>may comfort _him_; and perhaps, between friends, he began

<P>to tremble for his credit and his lungs in the Baron,

<P>and was not sorry to withdraw; and to make _you_ amends,

<P>Yates, I think we must raise a little theatre at Mansfield,

<P>and ask you to be our manager."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This, though the thought of the moment, did not end

<P>with the moment; for the inclination to act was awakened,

<P>and in no one more strongly than in him who was now

<P>master of the house; and who, having so much leisure

<P>as to make almost any novelty a certain good, had likewise

<P>such a degree of lively talents and comic taste,

<P>as were exactly adapted to the novelty of acting.

<P>The thought returned again and again.&nbsp; "Oh for the

<P>Ecclesford theatre and scenery to try something with."

<P>Each sister could echo the wish; and Henry Crawford,

<P>to whom, in all the riot of his gratifications it was

<P>yet an untasted pleasure, was quite alive at the idea.

<P>"I really believe," said he, "I could be fool enough

<P>at this moment to undertake any character that ever

<P>was written, from Shylock or Richard III down to the singing

<P>hero of a farce in his scarlet coat and cocked hat.

<P>I feel as if I could be anything or everything;

<P>as if I could rant and storm, or sigh or cut capers,

<P>in any tragedy or comedy in the English language.&nbsp; Let us

<P>be doing something.&nbsp; Be it only half a play, an act, a scene;

<P>what should prevent us?&nbsp; Not these countenances, I am sure,"

<P>looking towards the Miss Bertrams; "and for a theatre,

<P>what signifies a theatre?&nbsp; We shall be only amusing ourselves.

<P>Any room in this house might suffice."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We must have a curtain," said Tom Bertram; "a few yards

<P>of green baize for a curtain, and perhaps that may be enough."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, quite enough," cried Mr. Yates, "with only just a side wing

<P>or two run up, doors in flat, and three or four scenes to be

<P>let down; nothing more would be necessary on such a plan as this.

<P>For mere amusement among ourselves we should want nothing more."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I believe we must be satisfied with _less_," said Maria.

<P>"There would not be time, and other difficulties

<P>would arise.&nbsp; We must rather adopt Mr. Crawford's views,

<P>and make the _performance_, not the_theatre_, our object.

<P>Many parts of our best plays are independent of scenery."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Nay," said Edmund, who began to listen with alarm.

<P>"Let us do nothing by halves.&nbsp; If we are to act, let it be in

<P>a theatre completely fitted up with pit, boxes, and gallery,

<P>and let us have a play entire from beginning to end; so as it

<P>be a German play, no matter what, with a good tricking,

<P>shifting afterpiece, and a figure-dance, and a hornpipe,

<P>and a song between the acts.&nbsp; If we do not outdo Ecclesford,

<P>we do nothing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now, Edmund, do not be disagreeable," said Julia.

<P>"Nobody loves a play better than you do, or can have gone

<P>much farther to see one."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"True, to see real acting, good hardened real acting;

<P>but I would hardly walk from this room to the next to

<P>look at the raw efforts of those who have not been

<P>bred to the trade:&nbsp; a set of gentlemen and ladies,

<P>who have all the disadvantages of education and decorum

<P>to struggle through."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After a short pause, however, the subject still continued,

<P>and was discussed with unabated eagerness, every one's

<P>inclination increasing by the discussion, and a knowledge

<P>of the inclination of the rest; and though nothing was settled

<P>but that Tom Bertram would prefer a comedy, and his sisters

<P>and Henry Crawford a tragedy, and that nothing in the world

<P>could be easier than to find a piece which would please

<P>them all, the resolution to act something or other seemed

<P>so decided as to make Edmund quite uncomfortable.&nbsp; He was

<P>determined to prevent it, if possible, though his mother,

<P>who equally heard the conversation which passed at table,

<P>did not evince the least disapprobation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The same evening afforded him an opportunity of trying

<P>his strength.&nbsp; Maria, Julia, Henry Crawford, and Mr. Yates

<P>were in the billiard-room. Tom, returning from them into

<P>the drawing-room, where Edmund was standing thoughtfully

<P>by the fire, while Lady Bertram was on the sofa at a

<P>little distance, and Fanny close beside her arranging

<P>her work, thus began as he entered--"Such a horribly vile

<P>billiard-table as ours is not to be met with, I believe,

<P>above ground.&nbsp; I can stand it no longer, and I think,

<P>I may say, that nothing shall ever tempt me to it again;

<P>but one good thing I have just ascertained:&nbsp; it is the very

<P>room for a theatre, precisely the shape and length for it;

<P>and the doors at the farther end, communicating with each other,

<P>as they may be made to do in five minutes, by merely moving

<P>the bookcase in my father's room, is the very thing we

<P>could have desired, if we had sat down to wish for it;

<P>and my father's room will be an excellent greenroom.

<P>It seems to join the billiard-room on purpose."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are not serious, Tom, in meaning to act?" said Edmund,

<P>in a low voice, as his brother approached the fire.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not serious! never more so, I assure you.&nbsp; What is there

<P>to surprise you in it?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I think it would be very wrong.&nbsp; In a _general_ light,

<P>private theatricals are open to some objections, but as _we_

<P>are circumstanced, I must think it would be highly injudicious,

<P>and more than injudicious to attempt anything of the kind.

<P>It would shew great want of feeling on my father's account,

<P>absent as he is, and in some degree of constant danger;

<P>and it would be imprudent, I think, with regard to Maria,

<P>whose situation is a very delicate one, considering everything,

<P>extremely delicate."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You take up a thing so seriously! as if we were going

<P>to act three times a week till my father's return,

<P>and invite all the country.&nbsp; But it is not to be a

<P>display of that sort.&nbsp; We mean nothing but a little

<P>amusement among ourselves, just to vary the scene,

<P>and exercise our powers in something new.&nbsp; We want

<P>no audience, no publicity.&nbsp; We may be trusted, I think,

<P>in chusing some play most perfectly unexceptionable;

<P>and I can conceive no greater harm or danger to any of us

<P>in conversing in the elegant written language of some

<P>respectable author than in chattering in words of our own.

<P>I have no fears and no scruples.&nbsp; And as to my father's

<P>being absent, it is so far from an objection, that I

<P>consider it rather as a motive; for the expectation

<P>of his return must be a very anxious period to my mother;

<P>and if we can be the means of amusing that anxiety,

<P>and keeping up her spirits for the next few weeks, I shall

<P>think our time very well spent, and so, I am sure, will he.

<P>It is a _very_ anxious period for her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As he said this, each looked towards their mother.

<P>Lady Bertram, sunk back in one corner of the sofa,

<P>the picture of health, wealth, ease, and tranquillity,

<P>was just falling into a gentle doze, while Fanny was getting

<P>through the few difficulties of her work for her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Edmund smiled and shook his head.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"By Jove! this won't do," cried Tom, throwing himself into

<P>a chair with a hearty laugh.&nbsp; "To be sure, my dear mother,

<P>your anxiety--I was unlucky there."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What is the matter?" asked her ladyship, in the heavy

<P>tone of one half-roused; "I was not asleep."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh dear, no, ma'am, nobody suspected you!&nbsp; Well, Edmund,"

<P>he continued, returning to the former subject, posture,

<P>and voice, as soon as Lady Bertram began to nod again,

<P>"but _this_ I _will_ maintain, that we shall be doing

<P>no harm."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I cannot agree with you; I am convinced that my father

<P>would totally disapprove it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And I am convinced to the contrary.&nbsp; Nobody is fonder of

<P>the exercise of talent in young people, or promotes it more,

<P>than my father, and for anything of the acting, spouting,

<P>reciting kind, I think he has always a decided taste.

<P>I am sure he encouraged it in us as boys.&nbsp; How many a time

<P>have we mourned over the dead body of Julius Caesar,

<P>and to _be'd_ and not _to_ _be'd_, in this very room,

<P>for his amusement?&nbsp; And I am sure, _my_ _name_ _was_ _Norval_,

<P>every evening of my life through one Christmas holidays."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It was a very different thing.&nbsp; You must see the

<P>difference yourself.&nbsp; My father wished us, as schoolboys,

<P>to speak well, but he would never wish his grown-up

<P>daughters to be acting plays.&nbsp; His sense of decorum is strict."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I know all that," said Tom, displeased.&nbsp; "I know my father

<P>as well as you do; and I'll take care that his daughters

<P>do nothing to distress him.&nbsp; Manage your own concerns,

<P>Edmund, and I'll take care of the rest of the family."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If you are resolved on acting," replied the persevering Edmund,

<P>"I must hope it will be in a very small and quiet way;

<P>and I think a theatre ought not to be attempted.

<P>It would be taking liberties with my father's house

<P>in his absence which could not be justified."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"For everything of that nature I will be answerable,"

<P>said Tom, in a decided tone.&nbsp; "His house shall not be hurt.

<P>I have quite as great an interest in being careful

<P>of his house as you can have; and as to such alterations

<P>as I was suggesting just now, such as moving a bookcase,

<P>or unlocking a door, or even as using the billiard-room

<P>for the space of a week without playing at billiards in it,

<P>you might just as well suppose he would object to our sitting

<P>more in this room, and less in the breakfast-room, than

<P>we did before he went away, or to my sister's pianoforte

<P>being moved from one side of the room to the other.

<P>Absolute nonsense!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The innovation, if not wrong as an innovation, will be

<P>wrong as an expense."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, the expense of such an undertaking would be prodigious!

<P>Perhaps it might cost a whole twenty pounds.&nbsp; Something of

<P>a theatre we must have undoubtedly, but it will be on the

<P>simplest plan:&nbsp; a green curtain and a little carpenter's work,

<P>and that's all; and as the carpenter's work may be all

<P>done at home by Christopher Jackson himself, it will be

<P>too absurd to talk of expense; and as long as Jackson

<P>is employed, everything will be right with Sir Thomas.

<P>Don't imagine that nobody in this house can see or judge

<P>but yourself.&nbsp; Don't act yourself, if you do not like it,

<P>but don't expect to govern everybody else."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, as to acting myself," said Edmund, "_that_ I

<P>absolutely protest against."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Tom walked out of the room as he said it, and Edmund was

<P>left to sit down and stir the fire in thoughtful vexation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny, who had heard it all, and borne Edmund company

<P>in every feeling throughout the whole, now ventured to say,

<P>in her anxiety to suggest some comfort, "Perhaps they may

<P>not be able to find any play to suit them.&nbsp; Your brother's

<P>taste and your sisters' seem very different."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have no hope there, Fanny.&nbsp; If they persist in the scheme,

<P>they will find something.&nbsp; I shall speak to my sisters

<P>and try to dissuade _them_, and that is all I can do."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I should think my aunt Norris would be on your side."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I dare say she would, but she has no influence with

<P>either Tom or my sisters that could be of any use;

<P>and if I cannot convince them myself, I shall let things

<P>take their course, without attempting it through her.

<P>Family squabbling is the greatest evil of all, and we had

<P>better do anything than be altogether by the ears."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>His sisters, to whom he had an opportunity of speaking

<P>the next morning, were quite as impatient of his advice,

<P>quite as unyielding to his representation, quite as determined

<P>in the cause of pleasure, as Tom.&nbsp; Their mother had no

<P>objection to the plan, and they were not in the least afraid

<P>of their father's disapprobation.&nbsp; There could be no harm

<P>in what had been done in so many respectable families,

<P>and by so many women of the first consideration; and it

<P>must be scrupulousness run mad that could see anything to

<P>censure in a plan like theirs, comprehending only brothers

<P>and sisters and intimate friends, and which would never

<P>be heard of beyond themselves.&nbsp; Julia _did_ seem inclined

<P>to admit that Maria's situation might require particular

<P>caution and delicacy--but that could not extend to _her_--

<P>she was at liberty; and Maria evidently considered her

<P>engagement as only raising her so much more above restraint,

<P>and leaving her less occasion than Julia to consult

<P>either father or mother.&nbsp; Edmund had little to hope,

<P>but he was still urging the subject when Henry Crawford

<P>entered the room, fresh from the Parsonage, calling out,

<P>"No want of hands in our theatre, Miss Bertram.

<P>No want of understrappers:&nbsp; my sister desires her love,

<P>and hopes to be admitted into the company, and will be happy

<P>to take the part of any old duenna or tame confidante,

<P>that you may not like to do yourselves."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Maria gave Edmund a glance, which meant, "What say you now?

<P>Can we be wrong if Mary Crawford feels the same?"

<P>And Edmund, silenced, was obliged to acknowledge that the

<P>charm of acting might well carry fascination to the mind

<P>of genius; and with the ingenuity of love, to dwell more

<P>on the obliging, accommodating purport of the message

<P>than on anything else.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The scheme advanced.&nbsp; Opposition was vain; and as to

<P>Mrs. Norris, he was mistaken in supposing she would wish

<P>to make any.&nbsp; She started no difficulties that were

<P>not talked down in five minutes by her eldest nephew

<P>and niece, who were all-powerful with her; and as the

<P>whole arrangement was to bring very little expense

<P>to anybody, and none at all to herself, as she foresaw

<P>in it all the comforts of hurry, bustle, and importance,

<P>and derived the immediate advantage of fancying herself

<P>obliged to leave her own house, where she had been living

<P>a month at her own cost, and take up her abode in theirs,

<P>that every hour might be spent in their service, she was,

<P>in fact, exceedingly delighted with the project.
