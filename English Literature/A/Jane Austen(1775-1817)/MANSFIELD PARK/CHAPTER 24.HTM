<P>Henry Crawford had quite made up his mind by the

<P>next morning to give another fortnight to Mansfield,

<P>and having sent for his hunters, and written a few

<P>lines of explanation to the Admiral, he looked round at

<P>his sister as he sealed and threw the letter from him,

<P>and seeing the coast clear of the rest of the family,

<P>said, with a smile, "And how do you think I mean to

<P>amuse myself, Mary, on the days that I do not hunt?

<P>I am grown too old to go out more than three times a week;

<P>but I have a plan for the intermediate days, and what do you think

<P>it is?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"To walk and ride with me, to be sure."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not exactly, though I shall be happy to do both, but _that_

<P>would be exercise only to my body, and I must take care

<P>of my mind.&nbsp; Besides, _that_ would be all recreation

<P>and indulgence, without the wholesome alloy of labour,

<P>and I do not like to eat the bread of idleness.&nbsp; No, my plan

<P>is to make Fanny Price in love with me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Fanny Price!&nbsp; Nonsense!&nbsp; No, no.&nbsp; You ought to be

<P>satisfied with her two cousins."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But I cannot be satisfied without Fanny Price,

<P>without making a small hole in Fanny Price's heart.

<P>You do not seem properly aware of her claims to notice.

<P>When we talked of her last night, you none of you

<P>seemed sensible of the wonderful improvement that has

<P>taken place in her looks within the last six weeks.

<P>You see her every day, and therefore do not notice it;

<P>but I assure you she is quite a different creature

<P>from what she was in the autumn.&nbsp; She was then merely

<P>a quiet, modest, not plain-looking girl, but she is now

<P>absolutely pretty.&nbsp; I used to think she had neither

<P>complexion nor countenance; but in that soft skin of hers,

<P>so frequently tinged with a blush as it was yesterday,

<P>there is decided beauty; and from what I observed of her

<P>eyes and mouth, I do not despair of their being capable

<P>of expression enough when she has anything to express.

<P>And then, her air, her manner, her _tout_ _ensemble_,

<P>is so indescribably improved!&nbsp; She must be grown two inches,

<P>at least, since October."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Phoo! phoo!&nbsp; This is only because there were no tall women

<P>to compare her with, and because she has got a new gown,

<P>and you never saw her so well dressed before.&nbsp; She is

<P>just what she was in October, believe me.&nbsp; The truth is,

<P>that she was the only girl in company for you to notice,

<P>and you must have a somebody.&nbsp; I have always thought

<P>her pretty--not strikingly pretty--but 'pretty enough,'

<P>as people say; a sort of beauty that grows on one.

<P>Her eyes should be darker, but she has a sweet smile;

<P>but as for this wonderful degree of improvement, I am

<P>sure it may all be resolved into a better style of dress,

<P>and your having nobody else to look at; and therefore,

<P>if you do set about a flirtation with her, you never

<P>will persuade me that it is in compliment to her beauty,

<P>or that it proceeds from anything but your own idleness

<P>and folly."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her brother gave only a smile to this accusation,

<P>and soon afterwards said, "I do not quite know what to make

<P>of Miss Fanny.&nbsp; I do not understand her.&nbsp; I could not tell

<P>what she would be at yesterday.&nbsp; What is her character?

<P>Is she solemn?&nbsp; Is she queer?&nbsp; Is she prudish?&nbsp; Why did

<P>she draw back and look so grave at me?&nbsp; I could hardly get

<P>her to speak.&nbsp; I never was so long in company with a girl

<P>in my life, trying to entertain her, and succeed so ill!

<P>Never met with a girl who looked so grave on me!

<P>I must try to get the better of this.&nbsp; Her looks say,

<P>'I will not like you, I am determined not to like you';

<P>and I say she shall."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Foolish fellow!&nbsp; And so this is her attraction after all!

<P>This it is, her not caring about you, which gives

<P>her such a soft skin, and makes her so much taller,

<P>and produces all these charms and graces!&nbsp; I do desire

<P>that you will not be making her really unhappy;

<P>a _little_ love, perhaps, may animate and do her good,

<P>but I will not have you plunge her deep, for she is as

<P>good a little creature as ever lived, and has a great

<P>deal of feeling."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It can be but for a fortnight," said Henry; "and if a

<P>fortnight can kill her, she must have a constitution

<P>which nothing could save.&nbsp; No, I will not do her any harm,

<P>dear little soul! only want her to look kindly on me,

<P>to give me smiles as well as blushes, to keep a chair

<P>for me by herself wherever we are, and be all animation

<P>when I take it and talk to her; to think as I think,

<P>be interested in all my possessions and pleasures,

<P>try to keep me longer at Mansfield, and feel when I

<P>go away that she shall be never happy again.&nbsp; I want

<P>nothing more."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Moderation itself!" said Mary.&nbsp; "I can have no scruples now.

<P>Well, you will have opportunities enough of endeavouring

<P>to recommend yourself, for we are a great deal together."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And without attempting any farther remonstrance, she left

<P>Fanny to her fate, a fate which, had not Fanny's heart

<P>been guarded in a way unsuspected by Miss Crawford,

<P>might have been a little harder than she deserved;

<P>for although there doubtless are such unconquerable young

<P>ladies of eighteen (or one should not read about them)

<P>as are never to be persuaded into love against their judgment

<P>by all that talent, manner, attention, and flattery can do,

<P>I have no inclination to believe Fanny one of them,

<P>or to think that with so much tenderness of disposition,

<P>and so much taste as belonged to her, she could have

<P>escaped heart-whole from the courtship (though the

<P>courtship only of a fortnight) of such a man as Crawford,

<P>in spite of there being some previous ill opinion of him

<P>to be overcome, had not her affection been engaged elsewhere.

<P>With all the security which love of another and disesteem

<P>of him could give to the peace of mind he was attacking,

<P>his continued attentions--continued, but not obtrusive,

<P>and adapting themselves more and more to the gentleness

<P>and delicacy of her character--obliged her very soon

<P>to dislike him less than formerly.&nbsp; She had by no means

<P>forgotten the past, and she thought as ill of him as ever;

<P>but she felt his powers:&nbsp; he was entertaining; and his

<P>manners were so improved, so polite, so seriously and

<P>blamelessly polite, that it was impossible not to be civil

<P>to him in return.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A very few days were enough to effect this; and at the end

<P>of those few days, circumstances arose which had a tendency

<P>rather to forward his views of pleasing her, inasmuch as

<P>they gave her a degree of happiness which must dispose

<P>her to be pleased with everybody.&nbsp; William, her brother,

<P>the so long absent and dearly loved brother, was in

<P>England again.&nbsp; She had a letter from him herself, a few

<P>hurried happy lines, written as the ship came up Channel,

<P>and sent into Portsmouth with the first boat that left

<P>the Antwerp at anchor in Spithead; and when Crawford walked

<P>up with the newspaper in his hand, which he had hoped

<P>would bring the first tidings, he found her trembling

<P>with joy over this letter, and listening with a glowing,

<P>grateful countenance to the kind invitation which her

<P>uncle was most collectedly dictating in reply.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was but the day before that Crawford had made himself

<P>thoroughly master of the subject, or had in fact become

<P>at all aware of her having such a brother, or his being

<P>in such a ship, but the interest then excited had been

<P>very properly lively, determining him on his return to

<P>town to apply for information as to the probable period

<P>of the Antwerp's return from the Mediterranean, etc.;

<P>and the good luck which attended his early examination

<P>of ship news the next morning seemed the reward of his

<P>ingenuity in finding out such a method of pleasing her,

<P>as well as of his dutiful attention to the Admiral,

<P>in having for many years taken in the paper esteemed

<P>to have the earliest naval intelligence.&nbsp; He proved,

<P>however, to be too late.&nbsp; All those fine first feelings,

<P>of which he had hoped to be the exciter, were already given.

<P>But his intention, the kindness of his intention,

<P>was thankfully acknowledged:&nbsp; quite thankfully and warmly,

<P>for she was elevated beyond the common timidity of her

<P>mind by the flow of her love for William.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This dear William would soon be amongst them.&nbsp; There could

<P>be no doubt of his obtaining leave of absence immediately,

<P>for he was still only a midshipman; and as his parents,

<P>from living on the spot, must already have seen him,

<P>and be seeing him perhaps daily, his direct holidays

<P>might with justice be instantly given to the sister,

<P>who had been his best correspondent through a period of

<P>seven years, and the uncle who had done most for his support

<P>and advancement; and accordingly the reply to her reply,

<P>fixing a very early day for his arrival, came as soon

<P>as possible; and scarcely ten days had passed since Fanny

<P>had been in the agitation of her first dinner-visit,

<P>when she found herself in an agitation of a higher nature,

<P>watching in the hall, in the lobby, on the stairs,

<P>for the first sound of the carriage which was to bring her

<P>a brother.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It came happily while she was thus waiting; and there

<P>being neither ceremony nor fearfulness to delay the moment

<P>of meeting, she was with him as he entered the house,

<P>and the first minutes of exquisite feeling had no interruption

<P>and no witnesses, unless the servants chiefly intent

<P>upon opening the proper doors could be called such.

<P>This was exactly what Sir Thomas and Edmund had been

<P>separately conniving at, as each proved to the other

<P>by the sympathetic alacrity with which they both advised

<P>Mrs. Norris's continuing where she was, instead of rushing

<P>out into the hall as soon as the noises of the arrival

<P>reached them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>William and Fanny soon shewed themselves; and Sir Thomas

<P>had the pleasure of receiving, in his protege, certainly a

<P>very different person from the one he had equipped seven

<P>years ago, but a young man of an open, pleasant countenance,

<P>and frank, unstudied, but feeling and respectful manners,

<P>and such as confirmed him his friend.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was long before Fanny could recover from the agitating

<P>happiness of such an hour as was formed by the last

<P>thirty minutes of expectation, and the first of fruition;

<P>it was some time even before her happiness could be said

<P>to make her happy, before the disappointment inseparable

<P>from the alteration of person had vanished, and she could

<P>see in him the same William as before, and talk to him,

<P>as her heart had been yearning to do through many

<P>a past year.&nbsp; That time, however, did gradually come,

<P>forwarded by an affection on his side as warm as her own,

<P>and much less encumbered by refinement or self-distrust.

<P>She was the first object of his love, but it was a love

<P>which his stronger spirits, and bolder temper, made it

<P>as natural for him to express as to feel.&nbsp; On the morrow

<P>they were walking about together with true enjoyment,

<P>and every succeeding morrow renewed a _tete-a-tete_

<P>which Sir Thomas could not but observe with complacency,

<P>even before Edmund had pointed it out to him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Excepting the moments of peculiar delight, which any marked

<P>or unlooked-for instance of Edmund's consideration of her

<P>in the last few months had excited, Fanny had never known

<P>so much felicity in her life, as in this unchecked, equal,

<P>fearless intercourse with the brother and friend who was opening

<P>all his heart to her, telling her all his hopes and fears,

<P>plans, and solicitudes respecting that long thought of,

<P>dearly earned, and justly valued blessing of promotion;

<P>who could give her direct and minute information of the

<P>father and mother, brothers and sisters, of whom she

<P>very seldom heard; who was interested in all the comforts

<P>and all the little hardships of her home at Mansfield;

<P>ready to think of every member of that home as she directed,

<P>or differing only by a less scrupulous opinion, and more

<P>noisy abuse of their aunt Norris, and with whom (perhaps

<P>the dearest indulgence of the whole) all the evil and

<P>good of their earliest years could be gone over again,

<P>and every former united pain and pleasure retraced

<P>with the fondest recollection.&nbsp; An advantage this,

<P>a strengthener of love, in which even the conjugal tie

<P>is beneath the fraternal.&nbsp; Children of the same family,

<P>the same blood, with the same first associations and habits,

<P>have some means of enjoyment in their power, which no

<P>subsequent connexions can supply; and it must be by a

<P>long and unnatural estrangement, by a divorce which no

<P>subsequent connexion can justify, if such precious remains

<P>of the earliest attachments are ever entirely outlived.

<P>Too often, alas! it is so.&nbsp; Fraternal love, sometimes

<P>almost everything, is at others worse than nothing.

<P>But with William and Fanny Price it was still a sentiment

<P>in all its prime and freshness, wounded by no opposition

<P>of interest, cooled by no separate attachment, and feeling

<P>the influence of time and absence only in its increase.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>An affection so amiable was advancing each in the opinion

<P>of all who had hearts to value anything good.&nbsp; Henry Crawford

<P>was as much struck with it as any.&nbsp; He honoured the

<P>warm-hearted, blunt fondness of the young sailor, which led

<P>him to say, with his hands stretched towards Fanny's head,

<P>"Do you know, I begin to like that queer fashion already,

<P>though when I first heard of such things being done

<P>in England, I could not believe it; and when Mrs. Brown,

<P>and the other women at the Commissioner's at Gibraltar,

<P>appeared in the same trim, I thought they were mad; but Fanny

<P>can reconcile me to anything"; and saw, with lively admiration,

<P>the glow of Fanny's cheek, the brightness of her eye,

<P>the deep interest, the absorbed attention, while her

<P>brother was describing any of the imminent hazards,

<P>or terrific scenes, which such a period at sea must supply.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was a picture which Henry Crawford had moral taste enough

<P>to value.&nbsp; Fanny's attractions increased--increased twofold;

<P>for the sensibility which beautified her complexion and

<P>illumined her countenance was an attraction in itself.

<P>He was no longer in doubt of the capabilities of her heart.

<P>She had feeling, genuine feeling.&nbsp; It would be something

<P>to be loved by such a girl, to excite the first ardours

<P>of her young unsophisticated mind!&nbsp; She interested him

<P>more than he had foreseen.&nbsp; A fortnight was not enough.

<P>His stay became indefinite.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>William was often called on by his uncle to be the talker.

<P>His recitals were amusing in themselves to Sir Thomas,

<P>but the chief object in seeking them was to understand

<P>the reciter, to know the young man by his histories;

<P>and he listened to his clear, simple, spirited details with

<P>full satisfaction, seeing in them the proof of good principles,

<P>professional knowledge, energy, courage, and cheerfulness,

<P>everything that could deserve or promise well.

<P>Young as he was, William had already seen a great deal.

<P>He had been in the Mediterranean; in the West Indies;

<P>in the Mediterranean again; had been often taken on shore

<P>by the favour of his captain, and in the course of seven

<P>years had known every variety of danger which sea and war

<P>together could offer.&nbsp; With such means in his power he

<P>had a right to be listened to; and though Mrs. Norris could

<P>fidget about the room, and disturb everybody in quest

<P>of two needlefuls of thread or a second-hand shirt button,

<P>in the midst of her nephew's account of a shipwreck

<P>or an engagement, everybody else was attentive; and even

<P>Lady Bertram could not hear of such horrors unmoved,

<P>or without sometimes lifting her eyes from her work to say,

<P>"Dear me! how disagreeable!&nbsp; I wonder anybody can ever go

<P>to sea."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To Henry Crawford they gave a different feeling.&nbsp; He longed

<P>to have been at sea, and seen and done and suffered as much.

<P>His heart was warmed, his fancy fired, and he felt

<P>the highest respect for a lad who, before he was twenty,

<P>had gone through such bodily hardships and given such

<P>proofs of mind.&nbsp; The glory of heroism, of usefulness,

<P>of exertion, of endurance, made his own habits of selfish

<P>indulgence appear in shameful contrast; and he wished

<P>he had been a William Price, distinguishing himself and

<P>working his way to fortune and consequence with so much

<P>self-respect and happy ardour, instead of what he was!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The wish was rather eager than lasting.&nbsp; He was roused from

<P>the reverie of retrospection and regret produced by it,

<P>by some inquiry from Edmund as to his plans for the next

<P>day's hunting; and he found it was as well to be a man

<P>of fortune at once with horses and grooms at his command.

<P>In one respect it was better, as it gave him the means

<P>of conferring a kindness where he wished to oblige.

<P>With spirits, courage, and curiosity up to anything,

<P>William expressed an inclination to hunt; and Crawford could

<P>mount him without the slightest inconvenience to himself,

<P>and with only some scruples to obviate in Sir Thomas,

<P>who knew better than his nephew the value of such a loan,

<P>and some alarms to reason away in Fanny.&nbsp; She feared

<P>for William; by no means convinced by all that he could

<P>relate of his own horsemanship in various countries,

<P>of the scrambling parties in which he had been engaged,

<P>the rough horses and mules he had ridden, or his many narrow

<P>escapes from dreadful falls, that he was at all equal to the

<P>management of a high-fed hunter in an English fox-chase;

<P>nor till he returned safe and well, without accident

<P>or discredit, could she be reconciled to the risk,

<P>or feel any of that obligation to Mr. Crawford for lending

<P>the horse which he had fully intended it should produce.

<P>When it was proved, however, to have done William no harm,

<P>she could allow it to be a kindness, and even reward

<P>the owner with a smile when the animal was one minute

<P>tendered to his use again; and the next, with the

<P>greatest cordiality, and in a manner not to be resisted,

<P>made over to his use entirely so long as he remained

<P>in Northamptonshire.
