<P>It was presumed that Mr. Crawford was travelling back,

<P>to London, on the morrow, for nothing more was seen

<P>of him at Mr. Price's; and two days afterwards, it was

<P>a fact ascertained to Fanny by the following letter from

<P>his sister, opened and read by her, on another account,

<P>with the most anxious curiosity:--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I have to inform you, my dearest Fanny, that Henry

<P>has been down to Portsmouth to see you; that he had a

<P>delightful walk with you to the dockyard last Saturday,

<P>and one still more to be dwelt on the next day,

<P>on the ramparts; when the balmy air, the sparkling sea,

<P>and your sweet looks and conversation were altogether

<P>in the most delicious harmony, and afforded sensations

<P>which are to raise ecstasy even in retrospect.&nbsp; This, as well

<P>as I understand, is to be the substance of my information.

<P>He makes me write, but I do not know what else is to

<P>be communicated, except this said visit to Portsmouth,

<P>and these two said walks, and his introduction to

<P>your family, especially to a fair sister of yours, a fine

<P>girl of fifteen, who was of the party on the ramparts,

<P>taking her first lesson, I presume, in love.&nbsp; I have

<P>not time for writing much, but it would be out of place

<P>if I had, for this is to be a mere letter of business,

<P>penned for the purpose of conveying necessary information,

<P>which could not be delayed without risk of evil.&nbsp; My dear,

<P>dear Fanny, if I had you here, how I would talk to you!

<P>You should listen to me till you were tired, and advise

<P>me till you were still tired more; but it is impossible

<P>to put a hundredth part of my great mind on paper,

<P>so I will abstain altogether, and leave you to guess what

<P>you like.&nbsp; I have no news for you.&nbsp; You have politics,

<P>of course; and it would be too bad to plague you with

<P>the names of people and parties that fill up my time.

<P>I ought to have sent you an account of your cousin's

<P>first party, but I was lazy, and now it is too long ago;

<P>suffice it, that everything was just as it ought to be,

<P>in a style that any of her connexions must have been

<P>gratified to witness, and that her own dress and manners did

<P>her the greatest credit.&nbsp; My friend, Mrs. Fraser, is mad

<P>for such a house, and it would not make _me_ miserable.

<P>I go to Lady Stornaway after Easter; she seems in high spirits,

<P>and very happy.&nbsp; I fancy Lord S. is very good-humoured

<P>and pleasant in his own family, and I do not think him so

<P>very ill-looking as I did--at least, one sees many worse.

<P>He will not do by the side of your cousin Edmund.

<P>Of the last-mentioned hero, what shall I say?&nbsp; If I

<P>avoided his name entirely, it would look suspicious.

<P>I will say, then, that we have seen him two or three times,

<P>and that my friends here are very much struck with his

<P>gentlemanlike appearance.&nbsp; Mrs. Fraser (no bad judge)

<P>declares she knows but three men in town who have so good

<P>a person, height, and air; and I must confess, when he dined

<P>here the other day, there were none to compare with him,

<P>and we were a party of sixteen.&nbsp; Luckily there is no

<P>distinction of dress nowadays to tell tales, but--but--

<P>but Yours affectionately."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>I had almost forgot (it was Edmund's fault:&nbsp; he gets into

<P>my head more than does me good) one very material thing I

<P>had to say from Henry and myself--I mean about our taking

<P>you back into Northamptonshire.&nbsp; My dear little creature,

<P>do not stay at Portsmouth to lose your pretty looks.

<P>Those vile sea-breezes are the ruin of beauty and health.

<P>My poor aunt always felt affected if within ten miles

<P>of the sea, which the Admiral of course never believed,

<P>but I know it was so.&nbsp; I am at your service and Henry's,

<P>at an hour's notice.&nbsp; I should like the scheme, and we would

<P>make a little circuit, and shew you Everingham in our way,

<P>and perhaps you would not mind passing through London,

<P>and seeing the inside of St. George's, Hanover Square.

<P>Only keep your cousin Edmund from me at such a time:

<P>I should not like to be tempted.&nbsp; What a long letter!

<P>one word more.&nbsp; Henry, I find, has some idea of going

<P>into Norfolk again upon some business that _you_ approve;

<P>but this cannot possibly be permitted before the middle

<P>of next week; that is, he cannot anyhow be spared till

<P>after the l4th, for _we_ have a party that evening.

<P>The value of a man like Henry, on such an occasion,

<P>is what you can have no conception of; so you must take it

<P>upon my word to be inestimable.&nbsp; He will see the Rushworths,

<P>which own I am not sorry for--having a little curiosity,

<P>and so I think has he--though he will not acknowledge

<P>it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This was a letter to be run through eagerly, to be

<P>read deliberately, to supply matter for much reflection,

<P>and to leave everything in greater suspense than ever.

<P>The only certainty to be drawn from it was, that nothing

<P>decisive had yet taken place.&nbsp; Edmund had not yet spoken.

<P>How Miss Crawford really felt, how she meant to act,

<P>or might act without or against her meaning; whether his

<P>importance to her were quite what it had been before

<P>the last separation; whether, if lessened, it were likely

<P>to lessen more, or to recover itself, were subjects

<P>for endless conjecture, and to be thought of on that day

<P>and many days to come, without producing any conclusion.

<P>The idea that returned the oftenest was that Miss Crawford,

<P>after proving herself cooled and staggered by a return

<P>to London habits, would yet prove herself in the end

<P>too much attached to him to give him up.&nbsp; She would

<P>try to be more ambitious than her heart would allow.

<P>She would hesitate, she would tease, she would condition,

<P>she would require a great deal, but she would finally

<P>accept.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This was Fanny's most frequent expectation.&nbsp; A house

<P>in town--that, she thought, must be impossible.

<P>Yet there was no saying what Miss Crawford might not ask.

<P>The prospect for her cousin grew worse and worse.

<P>The woman who could speak of him, and speak only of

<P>his appearance!&nbsp; What an unworthy attachment!&nbsp; To be

<P>deriving support from the commendations of Mrs. Fraser!

<P>_She_ who had known him intimately half a year!

<P>Fanny was ashamed of her.&nbsp; Those parts of the letter which

<P>related only to Mr. Crawford and herself, touched her,

<P>in comparison, slightly.&nbsp; Whether Mr. Crawford went

<P>into Norfolk before or after the 14th was certainly

<P>no concern of hers, though, everything considered,

<P>she thought he _would_ go without delay.&nbsp; That Miss

<P>Crawford should endeavour to secure a meeting between him

<P>and Mrs. Rushworth, was all in her worst line of conduct,

<P>and grossly unkind and ill-judged; but she hoped _he_

<P>would not be actuated by any such degrading curiosity.

<P>He acknowledged no such inducement, and his sister

<P>ought to have given him credit for better feelings than

<P>her own.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was yet more impatient for another letter from

<P>town after receiving this than she had been before;

<P>and for a few days was so unsettled by it altogether,

<P>by what had come, and what might come, that her usual

<P>readings and conversation with Susan were much suspended.

<P>She could not command her attention as she wished.

<P>If Mr. Crawford remembered her message to her cousin,

<P>she thought it very likely, most likely, that he would write

<P>to her at all events; it would be most consistent with his

<P>usual kindness; and till she got rid of this idea, till it

<P>gradually wore off, by no letters appearing in the course

<P>of three or four days more, she was in a most restless,

<P>anxious state
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>At length, a something like composure succeeded.

<P>Suspense must be submitted to, and must not be allowed

<P>to wear her out, and make her useless.&nbsp; Time did something,

<P>her own exertions something more, and she resumed her

<P>attentions to Susan, and again awakened the same interest

<P>in them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Susan was growing very fond of her, and though without

<P>any of the early delight in books which had been

<P>so strong in Fanny, with a disposition much less

<P>inclined to sedentary pursuits, or to information for

<P>information's sake, she had so strong a desire of not

<P>_appearing_ ignorant, as, with a good clear understanding,

<P>made her a most attentive, profitable, thankful pupil.

<P>Fanny was her oracle.&nbsp; Fanny's explanations and remarks

<P>were a most important addition to every essay, or every

<P>chapter of history.&nbsp; What Fanny told her of former times

<P>dwelt more on her mind than the pages of Goldsmith; and she

<P>paid her sister the compliment of preferring her style

<P>to that of any printed author.&nbsp; The early habit of reading was

<P>wanting.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Their conversations, however, were not always on subjects

<P>so high as history or morals.&nbsp; Others had their hour;

<P>and of lesser matters, none returned so often,

<P>or remained so long between them, as Mansfield Park,

<P>a description of the people, the manners, the amusements,

<P>the ways of Mansfield Park.&nbsp; Susan, who had an innate taste

<P>for the genteel and well-appointed, was eager to hear,

<P>and Fanny could not but indulge herself in dwelling on

<P>so beloved a theme.&nbsp; She hoped it was not wrong; though,

<P>after a time, Susan's very great admiration of everything

<P>said or done in her uncle's house, and earnest longing

<P>to go into Northamptonshire, seemed almost to blame

<P>her for exciting feelings which could not be gratified.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Poor Susan was very little better fitted for home

<P>than her elder sister; and as Fanny grew thoroughly

<P>to understand this, she began to feel that when her

<P>own release from Portsmouth came, her happiness would

<P>have a material drawback in leaving Susan behind.

<P>That a girl so capable of being made everything good should

<P>be left in such hands, distressed her more and more.

<P>Were _she_ likely to have a home to invite her to,

<P>what a blessing it would be!&nbsp; And had it been possible

<P>for her to return Mr. Crawford's regard, the probability

<P>of his being very far from objecting to such a measure would

<P>have been the greatest increase of all her own comforts.

<P>She thought he was really good-tempered, and could fancy

<P>his entering into a plan of that sort most pleasantly.
