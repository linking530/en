<P>As Fanny could not doubt that her answer was conveying

<P>a real disappointment, she was rather in expectation,

<P>from her knowledge of Miss Crawford's temper, of being

<P>urged again; and though no second letter arrived for the

<P>space of a week, she had still the same feeling when it

<P>did come.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>On receiving it, she could instantly decide on its

<P>containing little writing, and was persuaded of its

<P>having the air of a letter of haste and business.

<P>Its object was unquestionable; and two moments were

<P>enough to start the probability of its being merely

<P>to give her notice that they should be in Portsmouth

<P>that very day, and to throw her into all the agitation

<P>of doubting what she ought to do in such a case.

<P>If two moments, however, can surround with difficulties,

<P>a third can disperse them; and before she had opened

<P>the letter, the possibility of Mr. and Miss Crawford's

<P>having applied to her uncle and obtained his permission

<P>was giving her ease.&nbsp; This was the letter--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A most scandalous, ill-natured rumour has just reached me,

<P>and I write, dear Fanny, to warn you against giving the

<P>least credit to it, should it spread into the country.

<P>Depend upon it, there is some mistake, and that a day or two

<P>will clear it up; at any rate, that Henry is blameless,

<P>and in spite of a moment's _etourderie_, thinks of

<P>nobody but you.&nbsp; Say not a word of it; hear nothing,

<P>surmise nothing, whisper nothing till I write again.

<P>I am sure it will be all hushed up, and nothing proved

<P>but Rushworth's folly.&nbsp; If they are gone, I would lay

<P>my life they are only gone to Mansfield Park, and Julia

<P>with them.&nbsp; But why would not you let us come for you?

<P>I wish you may not repent it.--Yours, etc."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny stood aghast.&nbsp; As no scandalous, ill-natured rumour

<P>had reached her, it was impossible for her to understand

<P>much of this strange letter.&nbsp; She could only perceive

<P>that it must relate to Wimpole Street and Mr. Crawford,

<P>and only conjecture that something very imprudent had just

<P>occurred in that quarter to draw the notice of the world,

<P>and to excite her jealousy, in Miss Crawford's apprehension,

<P>if she heard it.&nbsp; Miss Crawford need not be alarmed

<P>for her.&nbsp; She was only sorry for the parties concerned

<P>and for Mansfield, if the report should spread so far;

<P>but she hoped it might not.&nbsp; If the Rushworths were gone

<P>themselves to Mansfield, as was to be inferred from

<P>what Miss Crawford said, it was not likely that anything

<P>unpleasant should have preceded them, or at least should

<P>make any impression.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As to Mr. Crawford, she hoped it might give him a knowledge

<P>of his own disposition, convince him that he was not capable

<P>of being steadily attached to any one woman in the world,

<P>and shame him from persisting any longer in addressing herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was very strange!&nbsp; She had begun to think he really

<P>loved her, and to fancy his affection for her something

<P>more than common; and his sister still said that he cared

<P>for nobody else.&nbsp; Yet there must have been some marked

<P>display of attentions to her cousin, there must have

<P>been some strong indiscretion, since her correspondent

<P>was not of a sort to regard a slight one.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Very uncomfortable she was, and must continue, till she

<P>heard from Miss Crawford again.&nbsp; It was impossible to

<P>banish the letter from her thoughts, and she could not

<P>relieve herself by speaking of it to any human being.

<P>Miss Crawford need not have urged secrecy with so much warmth;

<P>she might have trusted to her sense of what was due

<P>to her cousin.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The next day came and brought no second letter.

<P>Fanny was disappointed.&nbsp; She could still think of little

<P>else all the morning; but, when her father came back

<P>in the afternoon with the daily newspaper as usual,

<P>she was so far from expecting any elucidation through such

<P>a channel that the subject was for a moment out of her head.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She was deep in other musing.&nbsp; The remembrance of her first

<P>evening in that room, of her father and his newspaper,

<P>came across her.&nbsp; No candle was now wanted.

<P>The sun was yet an hour and half above the horizon.

<P>She felt that she had, indeed, been three months there;

<P>and the sun's rays falling strongly into the parlour,

<P>instead of cheering, made her still more melancholy,

<P>for sunshine appeared to her a totally different thing

<P>in a town and in the country.&nbsp; Here, its power was only

<P>a glare:&nbsp; a stifling, sickly glare, serving but to bring

<P>forward stains and dirt that might otherwise have slept.

<P>There was neither health nor gaiety in sunshine in a town.

<P>She sat in a blaze of oppressive heat, in a cloud of

<P>moving dust, and her eyes could only wander from the walls,

<P>marked by her father's head, to the table cut and notched

<P>by her brothers, where stood the tea-board never

<P>thoroughly cleaned, the cups and saucers wiped in streaks,

<P>the milk a mixture of motes floating in thin blue,

<P>and the bread and butter growing every minute more

<P>greasy than even Rebecca's hands had first produced it.

<P>Her father read his newspaper, and her mother lamented

<P>over the ragged carpet as usual, while the tea was

<P>in preparation, and wished Rebecca would mend it;

<P>and Fanny was first roused by his calling out to her,

<P>after humphing and considering over a particular paragraph:

<P>"What's the name of your great cousins in town, Fan?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A moment's recollection enabled her to say, "Rushworth, sir."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And don't they live in Wimpole Street?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, sir."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Then, there's the devil to pay among them, that's all!

<P>There" (holding out the paper to her); "much good may such

<P>fine relations do you.&nbsp; I don't know what Sir Thomas may

<P>think of such matters; he may be too much of the courtier

<P>and fine gentleman to like his daughter the less.&nbsp; But, by G--

<P>! if she belonged to _me_, I'd give her the rope's end

<P>as long as I could stand over her.&nbsp; A little flogging for

<P>man and woman too would be the best way of preventing such things."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny read to herself that "it was with infinite concern

<P>the newspaper had to announce to the world a matrimonial

<P>_fracas_ in the family of Mr. R. of Wimpole Street;

<P>the beautiful Mrs. R., whose name had not long been

<P>enrolled in the lists of Hymen, and who had promised

<P>to become so brilliant a leader in the fashionable world,

<P>having quitted her husband's roof in company with the

<P>well-known and captivating Mr. C., the intimate friend

<P>and associate of Mr. R., and it was not known even

<P>to the editor of the newspaper whither they were gone."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is a mistake, sir," said Fanny instantly; "it must be

<P>a mistake, it cannot be true; it must mean some other people."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She spoke from the instinctive wish of delaying shame;

<P>she spoke with a resolution which sprung from despair,

<P>for she spoke what she did not, could not believe herself.

<P>It had been the shock of conviction as she read.&nbsp; The truth

<P>rushed on her; and how she could have spoken at all, how she

<P>could even have breathed, was afterwards matter of wonder

<P>to herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Price cared too little about the report to make her

<P>much answer.&nbsp; "It might be all a lie," he acknowledged;

<P>"but so many fine ladies were going to the devil nowadays

<P>that way, that there was no answering for anybody."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Indeed, I hope it is not true," said Mrs. Price plaintively;

<P>"it would be so very shocking!&nbsp; If I have spoken once

<P>to Rebecca about that carpet, I am sure I have spoke at

<P>least a dozen times; have not I, Betsey?&nbsp; And it would

<P>not be ten minutes' work."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The horror of a mind like Fanny's, as it received the

<P>conviction of such guilt, and began to take in some part

<P>of the misery that must ensue, can hardly be described.

<P>At first, it was a sort of stupefaction; but every moment

<P>was quickening her perception of the horrible evil.

<P>She could not doubt, she dared not indulge a hope,

<P>of the paragraph being false.&nbsp; Miss Crawford's letter,

<P>which she had read so often as to make every line her own,

<P>was in frightful conformity with it.&nbsp; Her eager defence

<P>of her brother, her hope of its being _hushed_ _up_,

<P>her evident agitation, were all of a piece with something

<P>very bad; and if there was a woman of character in existence,

<P>who could treat as a trifle this sin of the first magnitude,

<P>who would try to gloss it over, and desire to have it

<P>unpunished, she could believe Miss Crawford to be the woman!

<P>Now she could see her own mistake as to _who_ were gone,

<P>or _said_ to be gone.&nbsp; It was not Mr. and Mrs. Rushworth;

<P>it was Mrs. Rushworth and Mr. Crawford.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny seemed to herself never to have been shocked before.

<P>There was no possibility of rest.&nbsp; The evening passed

<P>without a pause of misery, the night was totally sleepless.

<P>She passed only from feelings of sickness to shudderings

<P>of horror; and from hot fits of fever to cold.&nbsp; The event

<P>was so shocking, that there were moments even when her

<P>heart revolted from it as impossible:&nbsp; when she thought

<P>it could not be.&nbsp; A woman married only six months ago;

<P>a man professing himself devoted, even _engaged_ to another;

<P>that other her near relation; the whole family,

<P>both families connected as they were by tie upon tie;

<P>all friends, all intimate together!&nbsp; It was too horrible

<P>a confusion of guilt, too gross a complication of evil,

<P>for human nature, not in a state of utter barbarism,

<P>to be capable of! yet her judgment told her it was so.

<P>_His_ unsettled affections, wavering with his vanity,

<P>_Maria's_ decided attachment, and no sufficient principle

<P>on either side, gave it possibility:&nbsp; Miss Crawford's

<P>letter stampt it a fact.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>What would be the consequence?&nbsp; Whom would it not injure?

<P>Whose views might it not affect?&nbsp; Whose peace would it

<P>not cut up for ever?&nbsp; Miss Crawford, herself, Edmund;

<P>but it was dangerous, perhaps, to tread such ground.

<P>She confined herself, or tried to confine herself, to the simple,

<P>indubitable family misery which must envelop all, if it were

<P>indeed a matter of certified guilt and public exposure.

<P>The mother's sufferings, the father's; there she paused.

<P>Julia's, Tom's, Edmund's; there a yet longer pause.

<P>They were the two on whom it would fall most horribly.

<P>Sir Thomas's parental solicitude and high sense of honour

<P>and decorum, Edmund's upright principles, unsuspicious temper,

<P>and genuine strength of feeling, made her think it

<P>scarcely possible for them to support life and reason

<P>under such disgrace; and it appeared to her that, as far

<P>as this world alone was concerned, the greatest blessing

<P>to every one of kindred with Mrs. Rushworth would be

<P>instant annihilation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Nothing happened the next day, or the next, to weaken

<P>her terrors.&nbsp; Two posts came in, and brought no refutation,

<P>public or private.&nbsp; There was no second letter to explain

<P>away the first from Miss Crawford; there was no intelligence

<P>from Mansfield, though it was now full time for her

<P>to hear again from her aunt.&nbsp; This was an evil omen.

<P>She had, indeed, scarcely the shadow of a hope to soothe

<P>her mind, and was reduced to so low and wan and trembling

<P>a condition, as no mother, not unkind, except Mrs. Price

<P>could have overlooked, when the third day did bring the

<P>sickening knock, and a letter was again put into her hands.

<P>It bore the London postmark, and came from Edmund.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dear Fanny,--You know our present wretchedness.

<P>May God support you under your share!&nbsp; We have been here

<P>two days, but there is nothing to be done.&nbsp; They cannot

<P>be traced.&nbsp; You may not have heard of the last blow--

<P>Julia's elopement; she is gone to Scotland with Yates.

<P>She left London a few hours before we entered it.

<P>At any other time this would have been felt dreadfully.

<P>Now it seems nothing; yet it is an heavy aggravation.

<P>My father is not overpowered.&nbsp; More cannot be hoped.

<P>He is still able to think and act; and I write,

<P>by his desire, to propose your returning home.

<P>He is anxious to get you there for my mother's sake.

<P>I shall be at Portsmouth the morning after you receive this,

<P>and hope to find you ready to set off for Mansfield.

<P>My father wishes you to invite Susan to go with you for a

<P>few months.&nbsp; Settle it as you like; say what is proper;

<P>I am sure you will feel such an instance of his

<P>kindness at such a moment!&nbsp; Do justice to his meaning,

<P>however I may confuse it.&nbsp; You may imagine something

<P>of my present state.&nbsp; There is no end of the evil let

<P>loose upon us.&nbsp; You will see me early by the mail.--

<P>Yours, etc."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Never had Fanny more wanted a cordial.&nbsp; Never had she felt

<P>such a one as this letter contained.&nbsp; To-morrow! to leave

<P>Portsmouth to-morrow! She was, she felt she was, in the

<P>greatest danger of being exquisitely happy, while so many

<P>were miserable.&nbsp; The evil which brought such good to her!

<P>She dreaded lest she should learn to be insensible of it.

<P>To be going so soon, sent for so kindly, sent for as

<P>a comfort, and with leave to take Susan, was altogether

<P>such a combination of blessings as set her heart in

<P>a glow, and for a time seemed to distance every pain,

<P>and make her incapable of suitably sharing the distress

<P>even of those whose distress she thought of most.

<P>Julia's elopement could affect her comparatively but little;

<P>she was amazed and shocked; but it could not occupy her,

<P>could not dwell on her mind.&nbsp; She was obliged to call

<P>herself to think of it, and acknowledge it to be terrible

<P>and grievous, or it was escaping her, in the midst of all

<P>the agitating pressing joyful cares attending this summons

<P>to herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There is nothing like employment, active indispensable employment,

<P>for relieving sorrow.&nbsp; Employment, even melancholy,

<P>may dispel melancholy, and her occupations were hopeful.

<P>She had so much to do, that not even the horrible

<P>story of Mrs. Rushworth--now fixed to the last point

<P>of certainty could affect her as it had done before.

<P>She had not time to be miserable.&nbsp; Within twenty-four

<P>hours she was hoping to be gone; her father and mother

<P>must be spoken to, Susan prepared, everything got ready.

<P>Business followed business; the day was hardly long enough.

<P>The happiness she was imparting, too, happiness very little

<P>alloyed by the black communication which must briefly

<P>precede it--the joyful consent of her father and mother

<P>to Susan's going with her--the general satisfaction with

<P>which the going of both seemed regarded, and the ecstasy

<P>of Susan herself, was all serving to support her spirits.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The affliction of the Bertrams was little felt in the family.

<P>Mrs. Price talked of her poor sister for a few minutes,

<P>but how to find anything to hold Susan's clothes,

<P>because Rebecca took away all the boxes and spoilt them,

<P>was much more in her thoughts:&nbsp; and as for Susan,

<P>now unexpectedly gratified in the first wish of her heart,

<P>and knowing nothing personally of those who had sinned,

<P>or of those who were sorrowing--if she could help rejoicing

<P>from beginning to end, it was as much as ought to be expected

<P>from human virtue at fourteen.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As nothing was really left for the decision of Mrs. Price,

<P>or the good offices of Rebecca, everything was rationally

<P>and duly accomplished, and the girls were ready for

<P>the morrow.&nbsp; The advantage of much sleep to prepare

<P>them for their journey was impossible.&nbsp; The cousin

<P>who was travelling towards them could hardly have less

<P>than visited their agitated spirits--one all happiness,

<P>the other all varying and indescribable perturbation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>By eight in the morning Edmund was in the house.&nbsp; The girls

<P>heard his entrance from above, and Fanny went down.

<P>The idea of immediately seeing him, with the knowledge

<P>of what he must be suffering, brought back all her own

<P>first feelings.&nbsp; He so near her, and in misery.&nbsp; She was

<P>ready to sink as she entered the parlour.&nbsp; He was alone,

<P>and met her instantly; and she found herself pressed

<P>to his heart with only these words, just articulate,

<P>"My Fanny, my only sister; my only comfort now!"

<P>She could say nothing; nor for some minutes could he

<P>say more.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He turned away to recover himself, and when he spoke again,

<P>though his voice still faltered, his manner shewed

<P>the wish of self-command, and the resolution of avoiding

<P>any farther allusion.&nbsp; "Have you breakfasted?&nbsp; When shall

<P>you be ready?&nbsp; Does Susan go?" were questions following

<P>each other rapidly.&nbsp; His great object was to be off

<P>as soon as possible.&nbsp; When Mansfield was considered,

<P>time was precious; and the state of his own mind made

<P>him find relief only in motion.&nbsp; It was settled that he

<P>should order the carriage to the door in half an hour.

<P>Fanny answered for their having breakfasted and being quite

<P>ready in half an hour.&nbsp; He had already ate, and declined

<P>staying for their meal.&nbsp; He would walk round the ramparts,

<P>and join them with the carriage.&nbsp; He was gone again;

<P>glad to get away even from Fanny.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He looked very ill; evidently suffering under

<P>violent emotions, which he was determined to suppress.

<P>She knew it must be so, but it was terrible to her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The carriage came; and he entered the house again at

<P>the same moment, just in time to spend a few minutes with

<P>the family, and be a witness--but that he saw nothing--

<P>of the tranquil manner in which the daughters were

<P>parted with, and just in time to prevent their sitting

<P>down to the breakfast-table, which, by dint of much

<P>unusual activity, was quite and completely ready as

<P>the carriage drove from the door.&nbsp; Fanny's last meal

<P>in her father's house was in character with her first:

<P>she was dismissed from it as hospitably as she had been welcomed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>How her heart swelled with joy and gratitude as she

<P>passed the barriers of Portsmouth, and how Susan's face

<P>wore its broadest smiles, may be easily conceived.

<P>Sitting forwards, however, and screened by her bonnet,

<P>those smiles were unseen.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The journey was likely to be a silent one.&nbsp; Edmund's deep

<P>sighs often reached Fanny.&nbsp; Had he been alone with her,

<P>his heart must have opened in spite of every resolution;

<P>but Susan's presence drove him quite into himself, and his

<P>attempts to talk on indifferent subjects could never be

<P>long supported.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny watched him with never-failing solicitude,

<P>and sometimes catching his eye, revived an affectionate smile,

<P>which comforted her; but the first day's journey passed

<P>without her hearing a word from him on the subjects

<P>that were weighing him down.&nbsp; The next morning produced

<P>a little more.&nbsp; Just before their setting out from Oxford,

<P>while Susan was stationed at a window, in eager observation

<P>of the departure of a large family from the inn,

<P>the other two were standing by the fire; and Edmund,

<P>particularly struck by the alteration in Fanny's looks,

<P>and from his ignorance of the daily evils of her

<P>father's house, attributing an undue share of the change,

<P>attributing _all_ to the recent event, took her hand,

<P>and said in a low, but very expressive tone, "No wonder--

<P>you must feel it--you must suffer.&nbsp; How a man who had

<P>once loved, could desert you!&nbsp; But _yours_--your regard

<P>was new compared with----Fanny, think of _me_!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The first division of their journey occupied a long day,

<P>and brought them, almost knocked up, to Oxford;

<P>but the second was over at a much earlier hour.

<P>They were in the environs of Mansfield long before

<P>the usual dinner-time, and as they approached the

<P>beloved place, the hearts of both sisters sank a little.

<P>Fanny began to dread the meeting with her aunts and Tom,

<P>under so dreadful a humiliation; and Susan to feel with

<P>some anxiety, that all her best manners, all her lately

<P>acquired knowledge of what was practised here, was on

<P>the point of being called into action.&nbsp; Visions of good

<P>and ill breeding, of old vulgarisms and new gentilities,

<P>were before her; and she was meditating much upon

<P>silver forks, napkins, and finger-glasses. Fanny had

<P>been everywhere awake to the difference of the country

<P>since February; but when they entered the Park her

<P>perceptions and her pleasures were of the keenest sort.

<P>It was three months, full three months, since her

<P>quitting it, and the change was from winter to summer.

<P>Her eye fell everywhere on lawns and plantations of the

<P>freshest green; and the trees, though not fully clothed,

<P>were in that delightful state when farther beauty is known

<P>to be at hand, and when, while much is actually given

<P>to the sight, more yet remains for the imagination.

<P>Her enjoyment, however, was for herself alone.&nbsp; Edmund could

<P>not share it.&nbsp; She looked at him, but he was leaning back,

<P>sunk in a deeper gloom than ever, and with eyes closed,

<P>as if the view of cheerfulness oppressed him, and the

<P>lovely scenes of home must be shut out.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It made her melancholy again; and the knowledge of what must

<P>be enduring there, invested even the house, modern, airy,

<P>and well situated as it was, with a melancholy aspect.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>By one of the suffering party within they were expected

<P>with such impatience as she had never known before.

<P>Fanny had scarcely passed the solemn-looking servants,
