<P>The conference was neither so short nor so conclusive

<P>as the lady had designed.&nbsp; The gentleman was not

<P>so easily satisfied.&nbsp; He had all the disposition to

<P>persevere that Sir Thomas could wish him.&nbsp; He had vanity,

<P>which strongly inclined him in the first place to think

<P>she did love him, though she might not know it herself;

<P>and which, secondly, when constrained at last to admit

<P>that she did know her own present feelings, convinced him

<P>that he should be able in time to make those feelings

<P>what he wished.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He was in love, very much in love; and it was a love which,

<P>operating on an active, sanguine spirit, of more warmth

<P>than delicacy, made her affection appear of greater

<P>consequence because it was withheld, and determined him

<P>to have the glory, as well as the felicity, of forcing

<P>her to love him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He would not despair:&nbsp; he would not desist.&nbsp; He had every

<P>well-grounded reason for solid attachment; he knew her

<P>to have all the worth that could justify the warmest

<P>hopes of lasting happiness with her; her conduct at this

<P>very time, by speaking the disinterestedness and delicacy

<P>of her character (qualities which he believed most rare

<P>indeed), was of a sort to heighten all his wishes,

<P>and confirm all his resolutions.&nbsp; He knew not that he had a

<P>pre-engaged heart to attack.&nbsp; Of _that_ he had no suspicion.

<P>He considered her rather as one who had never thought

<P>on the subject enough to be in danger; who had been

<P>guarded by youth, a youth of mind as lovely as of person;

<P>whose modesty had prevented her from understanding

<P>his attentions, and who was still overpowered by the

<P>suddenness of addresses so wholly unexpected, and the novelty

<P>of a situation which her fancy had never taken into account.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Must it not follow of course, that, when he was understood,

<P>he should succeed?&nbsp; He believed it fully.&nbsp; Love such as his,

<P>in a man like himself, must with perseverance secure a return,

<P>and at no great distance; and he had so much delight in

<P>the idea of obliging her to love him in a very short time,

<P>that her not loving him now was scarcely regretted.

<P>A little difficulty to be overcome was no evil to

<P>Henry Crawford.&nbsp; He rather derived spirits from it.

<P>He had been apt to gain hearts too easily.&nbsp; His situation

<P>was new and animating.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To Fanny, however, who had known too much opposition all her

<P>life to find any charm in it, all this was unintelligible.

<P>She found that he did mean to persevere; but how he could,

<P>after such language from her as she felt herself obliged

<P>to use, was not to be understood.&nbsp; She told him that she

<P>did not love him, could not love him, was sure she never

<P>should love him; that such a change was quite impossible;

<P>that the subject was most painful to her; that she must

<P>entreat him never to mention it again, to allow her to leave

<P>him at once, and let it be considered as concluded for ever.

<P>And when farther pressed, had added, that in her opinion

<P>their dispositions were so totally dissimilar as to make

<P>mutual affection incompatible; and that they were unfitted

<P>for each other by nature, education, and habit.&nbsp; All this

<P>she had said, and with the earnestness of sincerity;

<P>yet this was not enough, for he immediately denied there

<P>being anything uncongenial in their characters, or anything

<P>unfriendly in their situations; and positively declared,

<P>that he would still love, and still hope!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny knew her own meaning, but was no judge of her own manner.

<P>Her manner was incurably gentle; and she was not aware

<P>how much it concealed the sternness of her purpose.

<P>Her diffidence, gratitude, and softness made every expression

<P>of indifference seem almost an effort of self-denial;

<P>seem, at least, to be giving nearly as much pain to herself

<P>as to him.&nbsp; Mr. Crawford was no longer the Mr. Crawford who,

<P>as the clandestine, insidious, treacherous admirer of

<P>Maria Bertram, had been her abhorrence, whom she had hated

<P>to see or to speak to, in whom she could believe no good

<P>quality to exist, and whose power, even of being agreeable,

<P>she had barely acknowledged.&nbsp; He was now the Mr. Crawford

<P>who was addressing herself with ardent, disinterested love;

<P>whose feelings were apparently become all that was

<P>honourable and upright, whose views of happiness were all

<P>fixed on a marriage of attachment; who was pouring out

<P>his sense of her merits, describing and describing again

<P>his affection, proving as far as words could prove it,

<P>and in the language, tone, and spirit of a man of talent too,

<P>that he sought her for her gentleness and her goodness;

<P>and to complete the whole, he was now the Mr. Crawford

<P>who had procured William's promotion!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Here was a change, and here were claims which could

<P>not but operate!&nbsp; She might have disdained him in all

<P>the dignity of angry virtue, in the grounds of Sotherton,

<P>or the theatre at Mansfield Park; but he approached

<P>her now with rights that demanded different treatment.

<P>She must be courteous, and she must be compassionate.

<P>She must have a sensation of being honoured, and whether

<P>thinking of herself or her brother, she must have a strong

<P>feeling of gratitude.&nbsp; The effect of the whole was a

<P>manner so pitying and agitated, and words intermingled

<P>with her refusal so expressive of obligation and concern,

<P>that to a temper of vanity and hope like Crawford's,

<P>the truth, or at least the strength of her indifference,

<P>might well be questionable; and he was not so irrational

<P>as Fanny considered him, in the professions of persevering,

<P>assiduous, and not desponding attachment which closed

<P>the interview.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was with reluctance that he suffered her to go; but there

<P>was no look of despair in parting to belie his words,

<P>or give her hopes of his being less unreasonable than he

<P>professed himself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now she was angry.&nbsp; Some resentment did arise at a

<P>perseverance so selfish and ungenerous.&nbsp; Here was again

<P>a want of delicacy and regard for others which had formerly

<P>so struck and disgusted her.&nbsp; Here was again a something

<P>of the same Mr. Crawford whom she had so reprobated before.

<P>How evidently was there a gross want of feeling and humanity

<P>where his own pleasure was concerned; and alas! how always

<P>known no principle to supply as a duty what the heart

<P>was deficient in!&nbsp; Had her own affections been as free

<P>as perhaps they ought to have been, he never could have engaged

<P>them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So thought Fanny, in good truth and sober sadness,

<P>as she sat musing over that too great indulgence and luxury

<P>of a fire upstairs:&nbsp; wondering at the past and present;

<P>wondering at what was yet to come, and in a nervous

<P>agitation which made nothing clear to her but the persuasion

<P>of her being never under any circumstances able to love

<P>Mr. Crawford, and the felicity of having a fire to sit

<P>over and think of it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sir Thomas was obliged, or obliged himself, to wait till

<P>the morrow for a knowledge of what had passed between

<P>the young people.&nbsp; He then saw Mr. Crawford, and received

<P>his account.&nbsp; The first feeling was disappointment:

<P>he had hoped better things; he had thought that an hour's

<P>entreaty from a young man like Crawford could not have worked

<P>so little change on a gentle-tempered girl like Fanny;

<P>but there was speedy comfort in the determined views

<P>and sanguine perseverance of the lover; and when seeing

<P>such confidence of success in the principal, Sir Thomas

<P>was soon able to depend on it himself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Nothing was omitted, on his side, of civility, compliment,

<P>or kindness, that might assist the plan.&nbsp; Mr. Crawford's

<P>steadiness was honoured, and Fanny was praised, and the

<P>connexion was still the most desirable in the world.

<P>At Mansfield Park Mr. Crawford would always be welcome;

<P>he had only to consult his own judgment and feelings as

<P>to the frequency of his visits, at present or in future.

<P>In all his niece's family and friends, there could be

<P>but one opinion, one wish on the subject; the influence

<P>of all who loved her must incline one way.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Everything was said that could encourage, every encouragement

<P>received with grateful joy, and the gentlemen parted

<P>the best of friends.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Satisfied that the cause was now on a footing the most

<P>proper and hopeful, Sir Thomas resolved to abstain

<P>from all farther importunity with his niece, and to

<P>shew no open interference.&nbsp; Upon her disposition he

<P>believed kindness might be the best way of working.

<P>Entreaty should be from one quarter only.&nbsp; The forbearance

<P>of her family on a point, respecting which she could

<P>be in no doubt of their wishes, might be their surest

<P>means of forwarding it.&nbsp; Accordingly, on this principle,

<P>Sir Thomas took the first opportunity of saying to her,

<P>with a mild gravity, intended to be overcoming,

<P>"Well, Fanny, I have seen Mr. Crawford again, and learn

<P>from him exactly how matters stand between you.&nbsp; He is

<P>a most extraordinary young man, and whatever be the event,

<P>you must feel that you have created an attachment of no

<P>common character; though, young as you are, and little

<P>acquainted with the transient, varying, unsteady nature

<P>of love, as it generally exists, you cannot be struck

<P>as I am with all that is wonderful in a perseverance

<P>of this sort against discouragement.&nbsp; With him it is

<P>entirely a matter of feeling:&nbsp; he claims no merit in it;

<P>perhaps is entitled to none.&nbsp; Yet, having chosen so well,

<P>his constancy has a respectable stamp.&nbsp; Had his choice

<P>been less unexceptionable, I should have condemned

<P>his persevering."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Indeed, sir," said Fanny, "I am very sorry that Mr. Crawford

<P>should continue to know that it is paying me a very

<P>great compliment, and I feel most undeservedly honoured;

<P>but I am so perfectly convinced, and I have told him so,

<P>that it never will be in my power--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear," interrupted Sir Thomas, "there is no

<P>occasion for this.&nbsp; Your feelings are as well known

<P>to me as my wishes and regrets must be to you.

<P>There is nothing more to be said or done.&nbsp; From this

<P>hour the subject is never to be revived between us.

<P>You will have nothing to fear, or to be agitated about.

<P>You cannot suppose me capable of trying to persuade you

<P>to marry against your inclinations.&nbsp; Your happiness

<P>and advantage are all that I have in view, and nothing is

<P>required of you but to bear with Mr. Crawford's endeavours

<P>to convince you that they may not be incompatible with his.

<P>He proceeds at his own risk.&nbsp; You are on safe ground.

<P>I have engaged for your seeing him whenever he calls,

<P>as you might have done had nothing of this sort occurred.

<P>You will see him with the rest of us, in the same manner,

<P>and, as much as you can, dismissing the recollection of

<P>everything unpleasant.&nbsp; He leaves Northamptonshire so soon,

<P>that even this slight sacrifice cannot be often demanded.

<P>The future must be very uncertain.&nbsp; And now, my dear Fanny,

<P>this subject is closed between us."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The promised departure was all that Fanny could think

<P>of with much satisfaction.&nbsp; Her uncle's kind expressions,

<P>however, and forbearing manner, were sensibly felt;

<P>and when she considered how much of the truth was unknown

<P>to him, she believed she had no right to wonder at the line

<P>of conduct he pursued.&nbsp; He, who had married a daughter

<P>to Mr. Rushworth:&nbsp; romantic delicacy was certainly not

<P>to be expected from him.&nbsp; She must do her duty, and trust

<P>that time might make her duty easier than it now was.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She could not, though only eighteen, suppose Mr. Crawford's

<P>attachment would hold out for ever; she could not

<P>but imagine that steady, unceasing discouragement from

<P>herself would put an end to it in time.&nbsp; How much time

<P>she might, in her own fancy, allot for its dominion,

<P>is another concern.&nbsp; It would not be fair to inquire

<P>into a young lady's exact estimate of her own perfections.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In spite of his intended silence, Sir Thomas found himself

<P>once more obliged to mention the subject to his niece,

<P>to prepare her briefly for its being imparted to her aunts;

<P>a measure which he would still have avoided, if possible,

<P>but which became necessary from the totally opposite

<P>feelings of Mr. Crawford as to any secrecy of proceeding.

<P>He had no idea of concealment.&nbsp; It was all known at

<P>the Parsonage, where he loved to talk over the future

<P>with both his sisters, and it would be rather gratifying

<P>to him to have enlightened witnesses of the progress

<P>of his success.&nbsp; When Sir Thomas understood this, he felt

<P>the necessity of making his own wife and sister-in-law

<P>acquainted with the business without delay; though,

<P>on Fanny's account, he almost dreaded the effect of the

<P>communication to Mrs. Norris as much as Fanny herself.

<P>He deprecated her mistaken but well-meaning zeal.

<P>Sir Thomas, indeed, was, by this time, not very far from

<P>classing Mrs. Norris as one of those well-meaning people

<P>who are always doing mistaken and very disagreeable things.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Norris, however, relieved him.&nbsp; He pressed

<P>for the strictest forbearance and silence towards

<P>their niece; she not only promised, but did observe it.

<P>She only looked her increased ill-will. Angry she was:

<P>bitterly angry; but she was more angry with Fanny for

<P>having received such an offer than for refusing it.

<P>It was an injury and affront to Julia, who ought to have

<P>been Mr. Crawford's choice; and, independently of that,

<P>she disliked Fanny, because she had neglected her;

<P>and she would have grudged such an elevation to one whom

<P>she had been always trying to depress.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sir Thomas gave her more credit for discretion on the

<P>occasion than she deserved; and Fanny could have blessed

<P>her for allowing her only to see her displeasure,

<P>and not to hear it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Lady Bertram took it differently.&nbsp; She had been a beauty,

<P>and a prosperous beauty, all her life; and beauty

<P>and wealth were all that excited her respect.&nbsp; To know

<P>Fanny to be sought in marriage by a man of fortune,

<P>raised her, therefore, very much in her opinion.

<P>By convincing her that Fanny _was_ very pretty, which she

<P>had been doubting about before, and that she would be

<P>advantageously married, it made her feel a sort of credit

<P>in calling her niece.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well, Fanny," said she, as soon as they were alone

<P>together afterwards, and she really had known something

<P>like impatience to be alone with her, and her countenance,

<P>as she spoke, had extraordinary animation; "Well, Fanny,

<P>I have had a very agreeable surprise this morning.&nbsp; I must

<P>just speak of it _once_, I told Sir Thomas I must _once_,

<P>and then I shall have done.&nbsp; I give you joy, my dear niece."

<P>And looking at her complacently, she added, "Humph, we

<P>certainly are a handsome family!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny coloured, and doubted at first what to say;

<P>when, hoping to assail her on her vulnerable side,

<P>she presently answered--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear aunt, _you_ cannot wish me to do differently from

<P>what I have done, I am sure.&nbsp; _You_ cannot wish me to marry;

<P>for you would miss me, should not you?&nbsp; Yes, I am sure

<P>you would miss me too much for that."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, my dear, I should not think of missing you,

<P>when such an offer as this comes in your way.

<P>I could do very well without you, if you were married

<P>to a man of such good estate as Mr. Crawford.&nbsp; And you

<P>must be aware, Fanny, that it is every young woman's

<P>duty to accept such a very unexceptionable offer as this."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This was almost the only rule of conduct, the only piece

<P>of advice, which Fanny had ever received from her aunt

<P>in the course of eight years and a half.&nbsp; It silenced her.

<P>She felt how unprofitable contention would be.

<P>If her aunt's feelings were against her, nothing could

<P>be hoped from attacking her understanding.&nbsp; Lady Bertram

<P>was quite talkative.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I will tell you what, Fanny," said she, "I am sure he

<P>fell in love with you at the ball; I am sure the mischief

<P>was done that evening.&nbsp; You did look remarkably well.

<P>Everybody said so.&nbsp; Sir Thomas said so.&nbsp; And you know

<P>you had Chapman to help you to dress.&nbsp; I am very glad

<P>I sent Chapman to you.&nbsp; I shall tell Sir Thomas that I

<P>am sure it was done that evening."&nbsp; And still pursuing

<P>the same cheerful thoughts, she soon afterwards added,

<P>"And will tell you what, Fanny, which is more than I did

<P>for Maria:&nbsp; the next time Pug has a litter you shall have

<P>a puppy."
