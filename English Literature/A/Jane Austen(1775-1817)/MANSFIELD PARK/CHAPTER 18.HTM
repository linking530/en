<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>Everything was now in a regular train:&nbsp; theatre, actors,

<P>actresses, and dresses, were all getting forward;

<P>but though no other great impediments arose, Fanny found,

<P>before many days were past, that it was not all uninterrupted

<P>enjoyment to the party themselves, and that she had

<P>not to witness the continuance of such unanimity and

<P>delight as had been almost too much for her at first.

<P>Everybody began to have their vexation.&nbsp; Edmund had many.

<P>Entirely against _his_ judgment, a scene-painter arrived

<P>from town, and was at work, much to the increase

<P>of the expenses, and, what was worse, of the eclat of

<P>their proceedings; and his brother, instead of being really

<P>guided by him as to the privacy of the representation,

<P>was giving an invitation to every family who came in his way.

<P>Tom himself began to fret over the scene-painter's

<P>slow progress, and to feel the miseries of waiting.

<P>He had learned his part--all his parts, for he took

<P>every trifling one that could be united with the Butler,

<P>and began to be impatient to be acting; and every day

<P>thus unemployed was tending to increase his sense of

<P>the insignificance of all his parts together, and make

<P>him more ready to regret that some other play had not been chosen.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny, being always a very courteous listener, and often

<P>the only listener at hand, came in for the complaints

<P>and the distresses of most of them.&nbsp; _She_ knew that

<P>Mr. Yates was in general thought to rant dreadfully;

<P>that Mr. Yates was disappointed in Henry Crawford;

<P>that Tom Bertram spoke so quick he would be unintelligible;

<P>that Mrs. Grant spoiled everything by laughing; that Edmund

<P>was behindhand with his part, and that it was misery

<P>to have anything to do with Mr. Rushworth, who was wanting

<P>a prompter through every speech.&nbsp; She knew, also, that poor

<P>Mr. Rushworth could seldom get anybody to rehearse with him:

<P>_his_ complaint came before her as well as the rest;

<P>and so decided to her eye was her cousin Maria's

<P>avoidance of him, and so needlessly often the rehearsal

<P>of the first scene between her and Mr. Crawford, that she

<P>had soon all the terror of other complaints from _him_.

<P>So far from being all satisfied and all enjoying,

<P>she found everybody requiring something they had not,

<P>and giving occasion of discontent to the others.

<P>Everybody had a part either too long or too short;

<P>nobody would attend as they ought; nobody would remember on

<P>which side they were to come in; nobody but the complainer

<P>would observe any directions.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny believed herself to derive as much innocent enjoyment

<P>from the play as any of them; Henry Crawford acted well,

<P>and it was a pleasure to _her_ to creep into the theatre,

<P>and attend the rehearsal of the first act, in spite of the

<P>feelings it excited in some speeches for Maria.&nbsp; Maria, she

<P>also thought, acted well, too well; and after the first

<P>rehearsal or two, Fanny began to be their only audience;

<P>and sometimes as prompter, sometimes as spectator,

<P>was often very useful.&nbsp; As far as she could judge,

<P>Mr. Crawford was considerably the best actor of all:

<P>he had more confidence than Edmund, more judgment than Tom,

<P>more talent and taste than Mr. Yates.&nbsp; She did not like him

<P>as a man, but she must admit him to be the best actor,

<P>and on this point there were not many who differed from her.

<P>Mr. Yates, indeed, exclaimed against his tameness

<P>and insipidity; and the day came at last, when Mr. Rushworth

<P>turned to her with a black look, and said, "Do you think

<P>there is anything so very fine in all this?&nbsp; For the life

<P>and soul of me, I cannot admire him; and, between ourselves,

<P>to see such an undersized, little, mean-looking man,

<P>set up for a fine actor, is very ridiculous in my opinion."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>From this moment there was a return of his former jealousy,

<P>which Maria, from increasing hopes of Crawford, was at

<P>little pains to remove; and the chances of Mr. Rushworth's

<P>ever attaining to the knowledge of his two-and-forty

<P>speeches became much less.&nbsp; As to his ever making anything

<P>_tolerable_ of them, nobody had the smallest idea of that

<P>except his mother; _she_, indeed, regretted that his part

<P>was not more considerable, and deferred coming over to

<P>Mansfield till they were forward enough in their rehearsal

<P>to comprehend all his scenes; but the others aspired at

<P>nothing beyond his remembering the catchword, and the first

<P>line of his speech, and being able to follow the prompter

<P>through the rest.&nbsp; Fanny, in her pity and kindheartedness,

<P>was at great pains to teach him how to learn, giving him

<P>all the helps and directions in her power, trying to make

<P>an artificial memory for him, and learning every word

<P>of his part herself, but without his being much the forwarder.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Many uncomfortable, anxious, apprehensive feelings she

<P>certainly had; but with all these, and other claims

<P>on her time and attention, she was as far from finding

<P>herself without employment or utility amongst them,

<P>as without a companion in uneasiness; quite as far from

<P>having no demand on her leisure as on her compassion.

<P>The gloom of her first anticipations was proved to have

<P>been unfounded.&nbsp; She was occasionally useful to all;

<P>she was perhaps as much at peace as any.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was a great deal of needlework to be done, moreover,

<P>in which her help was wanted; and that Mrs. Norris

<P>thought her quite as well off as the rest, was evident

<P>by the manner in which she claimed it--"Come, Fanny,"

<P>she cried, "these are fine times for you, but you must

<P>not be always walking from one room to the other,

<P>and doing the lookings-on at your ease, in this way;

<P>I want you here.&nbsp; I have been slaving myself till I

<P>can hardly stand, to contrive Mr. Rushworth's cloak

<P>without sending for any more satin; and now I think

<P>you may give me your help in putting it together.

<P>There are but three seams; you may do them in a trice.

<P>It would be lucky for me if I had nothing but the executive

<P>part to do.&nbsp; _You_ are best off, I can tell you:

<P>but if nobody did more than _you_, we should not get on

<P>very fast"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny took the work very quietly, without attempting

<P>any defence; but her kinder aunt Bertram observed on her behalf--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"One cannot wonder, sister, that Fanny _should_ be delighted:

<P>it is all new to her, you know; you and I used to be

<P>very fond of a play ourselves, and so am I still;

<P>and as soon as I am a little more at leisure, _I_ mean

<P>to look in at their rehearsals too.&nbsp; What is the play about,

<P>Fanny? you have never told me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! sister, pray do not ask her now; for Fanny is not

<P>one of those who can talk and work at the same time.

<P>It is about Lovers' Vows."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I believe," said Fanny to her aunt Bertram, "there will

<P>be three acts rehearsed to-morrow evening, and that will

<P>give you an opportunity of seeing all the actors at once."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You had better stay till the curtain is hung," interposed

<P>Mrs. Norris; "the curtain will be hung in a day or two--

<P>there is very little sense in a play without a curtain--

<P>and I am much mistaken if you do not find it draw up

<P>into very handsome festoons."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Lady Bertram seemed quite resigned to waiting.&nbsp; Fanny did

<P>not share her aunt's composure:&nbsp; she thought of the morrow

<P>a great deal, for if the three acts were rehearsed,

<P>Edmund and Miss Crawford would then be acting together

<P>for the first time; the third act would bring a scene

<P>between them which interested her most particularly,

<P>and which she was longing and dreading to see how they

<P>would perform.&nbsp; The whole subject of it was love--

<P>a marriage of love was to be described by the gentleman,

<P>and very little short of a declaration of love be made by

<P>the lady.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She had read and read the scene again with many painful,

<P>many wondering emotions, and looked forward to their

<P>representation of it as a circumstance almost too interesting.

<P>She did not _believe_ they had yet rehearsed it,

<P>even in private.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The morrow came, the plan for the evening continued,

<P>and Fanny's consideration of it did not become less agitated.

<P>She worked very diligently under her aunt's directions,

<P>but her diligence and her silence concealed a very absent,

<P>anxious mind; and about noon she made her escape with her

<P>work to the East room, that she might have no concern

<P>in another, and, as she deemed it, most unnecessary

<P>rehearsal of the first act, which Henry Crawford was

<P>just proposing, desirous at once of having her time

<P>to herself, and of avoiding the sight of Mr. Rushworth.

<P>A glimpse, as she passed through the hall, of the two

<P>ladies walking up from the Parsonage made no change

<P>in her wish of retreat, and she worked and meditated

<P>in the East room, undisturbed, for a quarter of an hour,

<P>when a gentle tap at the door was followed by the entrance

<P>of Miss Crawford.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Am I right?&nbsp; Yes; this is the East room.&nbsp; My dear

<P>Miss Price, I beg your pardon, but I have made my way

<P>to you on purpose to entreat your help."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny, quite surprised, endeavoured to shew herself

<P>mistress of the room by her civilities, and looked

<P>at the bright bars of her empty grate with concern.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Thank you; I am quite warm, very warm.&nbsp; Allow me to stay

<P>here a little while, and do have the goodness to hear me

<P>my third act.&nbsp; I have brought my book, and if you would

<P>but rehearse it with me, I should be _so_ obliged!

<P>I came here to-day intending to rehearse it with Edmund--

<P>by ourselves--against the evening, but he is not in the way;

<P>and if he _were_, I do not think I could go through

<P>it with _him_, till I have hardened myself a little;

<P>for really there is a speech or two.&nbsp; You will be so good,

<P>won't you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny was most civil in her assurances, though she could

<P>not give them in a very steady voice.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Have you ever happened to look at the part I mean?"

<P>continued Miss Crawford, opening her book.&nbsp; "Here it is.

<P>I did not think much of it at first--but, upon my word.

<P>There, look at _that_ speech, and _that_, and _that_.

<P>How am I ever to look him in the face and say such things?

<P>Could you do it?&nbsp; But then he is your cousin, which makes

<P>all the difference.&nbsp; You must rehearse it with me, that I

<P>may fancy _you_ him, and get on by degrees.&nbsp; You _have_ a look

<P>of _his_ sometimes."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Have I?&nbsp; I will do my best with the greatest readiness;

<P>but I must _read_ the part, for I can say very little

<P>of it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"_None_ of it, I suppose.&nbsp; You are to have the book,

<P>of course.&nbsp; Now for it.&nbsp; We must have two chairs at hand

<P>for you to bring forward to the front of the stage.

<P>There--very good school-room chairs, not made for a theatre,

<P>I dare say; much more fitted for little girls to sit and

<P>kick their feet against when they are learning a lesson.

<P>What would your governess and your uncle say to see them

<P>used for such a purpose?&nbsp; Could Sir Thomas look in upon us

<P>just now, he would bless himself, for we are rehearsing

<P>all over the house.&nbsp; Yates is storming away in the

<P>dining-room. I heard him as I came upstairs, and the theatre

<P>is engaged of course by those indefatigable rehearsers,

<P>Agatha and Frederick.&nbsp; If _they_ are not perfect,

<P>I _shall_ be surprised.&nbsp; By the bye, I looked in upon

<P>them five minutes ago, and it happened to be exactly at

<P>one of the times when they were trying _not_ to embrace,

<P>and Mr. Rushworth was with me.&nbsp; I thought he began to look

<P>a little queer, so I turned it off as well as I could,

<P>by whispering to him, 'We shall have an excellent Agatha;

<P>there is something so _maternal_ in her manner,

<P>so completely _maternal_ in her voice and countenance.'

<P>Was not that well done of me?&nbsp; He brightened up directly.

<P>Now for my soliloquy."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She began, and Fanny joined in with all the modest feeling

<P>which the idea of representing Edmund was so strongly

<P>calculated to inspire; but with looks and voice so truly

<P>feminine as to be no very good picture of a man.&nbsp; With such

<P>an Anhalt, however, Miss Crawford had courage enough;

<P>and they had got through half the scene, when a tap at

<P>the door brought a pause, and the entrance of Edmund,

<P>the next moment, suspended it all.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Surprise, consciousness, and pleasure appeared in each

<P>of the three on this unexpected meeting; and as Edmund

<P>was come on the very same business that had brought

<P>Miss Crawford, consciousness and pleasure were likely

<P>to be more than momentary in _them_.&nbsp; He too had his book,

<P>and was seeking Fanny, to ask her to rehearse with him,

<P>and help him to prepare for the evening, without knowing

<P>Miss Crawford to be in the house; and great was the joy and

<P>animation of being thus thrown together, of comparing schemes,

<P>and sympathising in praise of Fanny's kind offices.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>_She_ could not equal them in their warmth.&nbsp; _Her_ spirits

<P>sank under the glow of theirs, and she felt herself becoming

<P>too nearly nothing to both to have any comfort in having

<P>been sought by either.&nbsp; They must now rehearse together.

<P>Edmund proposed, urged, entreated it, till the lady,

<P>not very unwilling at first, could refuse no longer,

<P>and Fanny was wanted only to prompt and observe them.

<P>She was invested, indeed, with the office of judge and critic,

<P>and earnestly desired to exercise it and tell them all

<P>their faults; but from doing so every feeling within

<P>her shrank--she could not, would not, dared not attempt it:

<P>had she been otherwise qualified for criticism, her conscience

<P>must have restrained her from venturing at disapprobation.

<P>She believed herself to feel too much of it in the aggregate

<P>for honesty or safety in particulars.&nbsp; To prompt them must

<P>be enough for her; and it was sometimes _more_ than enough;

<P>for she could not always pay attention to the book.

<P>In watching them she forgot herself; and, agitated by the

<P>increasing spirit of Edmund's manner, had once closed

<P>the page and turned away exactly as he wanted help.

<P>It was imputed to very reasonable weariness, and she was

<P>thanked and pitied; but she deserved their pity more than

<P>she hoped they would ever surmise.&nbsp; At last the scene

<P>was over, and Fanny forced herself to add her praise to

<P>the compliments each was giving the other; and when again

<P>alone and able to recall the whole, she was inclined

<P>to believe their performance would, indeed, have such

<P>nature and feeling in it as must ensure their credit,

<P>and make it a very suffering exhibition to herself.

<P>Whatever might be its effect, however, she must stand

<P>the brunt of it again that very day.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The first regular rehearsal of the three first acts

<P>was certainly to take place in the evening:&nbsp; Mrs. Grant

<P>and the Crawfords were engaged to return for that purpose

<P>as soon as they could after dinner; and every one concerned

<P>was looking forward with eagerness.&nbsp; There seemed

<P>a general diffusion of cheerfulness on the occasion.

<P>Tom was enjoying such an advance towards the end;

<P>Edmund was in spirits from the morning's rehearsal,

<P>and little vexations seemed everywhere smoothed away.

<P>All were alert and impatient; the ladies moved soon,

<P>the gentlemen soon followed them, and with the exception

<P>of Lady Bertram, Mrs. Norris, and Julia, everybody was

<P>in the theatre at an early hour; and having lighted it up

<P>as well as its unfinished state admitted, were waiting only

<P>the arrival of Mrs. Grant and the Crawfords to begin.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They did not wait long for the Crawfords, but there

<P>was no Mrs. Grant.&nbsp; She could not come.&nbsp; Dr. Grant,

<P>professing an indisposition, for which he had little credit

<P>with his fair sister-in-law, could not spare his wife.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Dr. Grant is ill," said she, with mock solemnity.

<P>"He has been ill ever since he did not eat any of the

<P>pheasant today.&nbsp; He fancied it tough, sent away his plate,

<P>and has been suffering ever since".
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Here was disappointment!&nbsp; Mrs. Grant's non-attendance

<P>was sad indeed.&nbsp; Her pleasant manners and cheerful

<P>conformity made her always valuable amongst them;

<P>but _now_ she was absolutely necessary.&nbsp; They could not act,

<P>they could not rehearse with any satisfaction without her.

<P>The comfort of the whole evening was destroyed.

<P>What was to be done?&nbsp; Tom, as Cottager, was in despair.

<P>After a pause of perplexity, some eyes began to be

<P>turned towards Fanny, and a voice or two to say,

<P>"If Miss Price would be so good as to _read_ the part."

<P>She was immediately surrounded by supplications;

<P>everybody asked it; even Edmund said, "Do, Fanny, if it is

<P>not _very_ disagreeable to you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>But Fanny still hung back.&nbsp; She could not endure the idea

<P>of it.&nbsp; Why was not Miss Crawford to be applied to as well?

<P>Or why had not she rather gone to her own room,

<P>as she had felt to be safest, instead of attending

<P>the rehearsal at all?&nbsp; She had known it would irritate

<P>and distress her; she had known it her duty to keep away.

<P>She was properly punished.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You have only to _read_ the part," said Henry Crawford,

<P>with renewed entreaty.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And I do believe she can say every word of it,"

<P>added Maria, "for she could put Mrs. Grant right the other

<P>day in twenty places.&nbsp; Fanny, I am sure you know the part."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny could not say she did _not_; and as they all persevered,

<P>as Edmund repeated his wish, and with a look of even

<P>fond dependence on her good-nature, she must yield.

<P>She would do her best.&nbsp; Everybody was satisfied; and she

<P>was left to the tremors of a most palpitating heart,

<P>while the others prepared to begin.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They _did_ begin; and being too much engaged in their

<P>own noise to be struck by an unusual noise in the other

<P>part of the house, had proceeded some way when the door

<P>of the room was thrown open, and Julia, appearing at it,

<P>with a face all aghast, exclaimed, "My father is come!

<P>He is in the hall at this moment."
