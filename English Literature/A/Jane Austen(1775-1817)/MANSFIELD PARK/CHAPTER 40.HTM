<P>Fanny was right enough in not expecting to hear from Miss

<P>Crawford now at the rapid rate in which their correspondence

<P>had begun; Mary's next letter was after a decidedly longer

<P>interval than the last, but she was not right in supposing

<P>that such an interval would be felt a great relief

<P>to herself.&nbsp; Here was another strange revolution of mind!

<P>She was really glad to receive the letter when it did come.

<P>In her present exile from good society, and distance from

<P>everything that had been wont to interest her, a letter

<P>from one belonging to the set where her heart lived,

<P>written with affection, and some degree of elegance,

<P>was thoroughly acceptable.&nbsp; The usual plea of increasing

<P>engagements was made in excuse for not having

<P>written to her earlier; "And now that I have begun,"

<P>she continued, "my letter will not be worth your reading,

<P>for there will be no little offering of love at the end,

<P>no three or four lines _passionnees_ from the most

<P>devoted H. C. in the world, for Henry is in Norfolk;

<P>business called him to Everingham ten days ago,

<P>or perhaps he only pretended to call, for the sake of being

<P>travelling at the same time that you were.&nbsp; But there

<P>he is, and, by the bye, his absence may sufficiently account

<P>for any remissness of his sister's in writing, for there

<P>has been no 'Well, Mary, when do you write to Fanny?

<P>Is not it time for you to write to Fanny?' to spur me on.

<P>At last, after various attempts at meeting, I have seen

<P>your cousins, 'dear Julia and dearest Mrs. Rushworth';

<P>they found me at home yesterday, and we were glad to

<P>see each other again.&nbsp; We _seemed_ _very_ glad to see

<P>each other, and I do really think we were a little.

<P>We had a vast deal to say.&nbsp; Shall I tell you how

<P>Mrs. Rushworth looked when your name was mentioned?

<P>I did not use to think her wanting in self-possession,

<P>but she had not quite enough for the demands of yesterday.

<P>Upon the whole, Julia was in the best looks of the two,

<P>at least after you were spoken of.&nbsp; There was no

<P>recovering the complexion from the moment that I spoke

<P>of 'Fanny,' and spoke of her as a sister should.

<P>But Mrs. Rushworth's day of good looks will come;

<P>we have cards for her first party on the 28th.&nbsp; Then she

<P>will be in beauty, for she will open one of the best

<P>houses in Wimpole Street.&nbsp; I was in it two years ago,

<P>when it was Lady Lascelle's, and prefer it to almost

<P>any I know in London, and certainly she will then feel,

<P>to use a vulgar phrase, that she has got her pennyworth

<P>for her penny.&nbsp; Henry could not have afforded her such

<P>a house.&nbsp; I hope she will recollect it, and be satisfied,

<P>as well as she may, with moving the queen of a palace,

<P>though the king may appear best in the background;

<P>and as I have no desire to tease her, I shall never _force_

<P>your name upon her again.&nbsp; She will grow sober by degrees.

<P>From all that I hear and guess, Baron Wildenheim's

<P>attentions to Julia continue, but I do not know that he

<P>has any serious encouragement.&nbsp; She ought to do better.

<P>A poor honourable is no catch, and I cannot imagine any

<P>liking in the case, for take away his rants, and the poor

<P>baron has nothing.&nbsp; What a difference a vowel makes!

<P>If his rents were but equal to his rants!&nbsp; Your cousin

<P>Edmund moves slowly; detained, perchance, by parish duties.

<P>There may be some old woman at Thornton Lacey to be converted.

<P>I am unwilling to fancy myself neglected for a _young_ one.

<P>Adieu! my dear sweet Fanny, this is a long letter from London:

<P>write me a pretty one in reply to gladden Henry's eyes,

<P>when he comes back, and send me an account of all the dashing

<P>young captains whom you disdain for his sake."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was great food for meditation in this letter,

<P>and chiefly for unpleasant meditation; and yet, with all

<P>the uneasiness it supplied, it connected her with the absent,

<P>it told her of people and things about whom she had never

<P>felt so much curiosity as now, and she would have been

<P>glad to have been sure of such a letter every week.

<P>Her correspondence with her aunt Bertram was her only

<P>concern of higher interest.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>As for any society in Portsmouth, that could at all make

<P>amends for deficiencies at home, there were none within

<P>the circle of her father's and mother's acquaintance

<P>to afford her the smallest satisfaction:&nbsp; she saw nobody

<P>in whose favour she could wish to overcome her own

<P>shyness and reserve.&nbsp; The men appeared to her all coarse,

<P>the women all pert, everybody underbred; and she gave

<P>as little contentment as she received from introductions

<P>either to old or new acquaintance.&nbsp; The young ladies who

<P>approached her at first with some respect, in consideration

<P>of her coming from a baronet's family, were soon offended

<P>by what they termed "airs"; for, as she neither played

<P>on the pianoforte nor wore fine pelisses, they could,

<P>on farther observation, admit no right of superiority.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The first solid consolation which Fanny received for

<P>the evils of home, the first which her judgment could

<P>entirely approve, and which gave any promise of durability,

<P>was in a better knowledge of Susan, and a hope of being

<P>of service to her.&nbsp; Susan had always behaved pleasantly

<P>to herself, but the determined character of her general

<P>manners had astonished and alarmed her, and it was at least

<P>a fortnight before she began to understand a disposition

<P>so totally different from her own.&nbsp; Susan saw that much

<P>was wrong at home, and wanted to set it right.&nbsp; That a girl

<P>of fourteen, acting only on her own unassisted reason,

<P>should err in the method of reform, was not wonderful;

<P>and Fanny soon became more disposed to admire the natural

<P>light of the mind which could so early distinguish justly,

<P>than to censure severely the faults of conduct to which it led.

<P>Susan was only acting on the same truths, and pursuing

<P>the same system, which her own judgment acknowledged,

<P>but which her more supine and yielding temper would

<P>have shrunk from asserting.&nbsp; Susan tried to be useful,

<P>where _she_ could only have gone away and cried; and that

<P>Susan was useful she could perceive; that things, bad as

<P>they were, would have been worse but for such interposition,

<P>and that both her mother and Betsey were restrained from

<P>some excesses of very offensive indulgence and vulgarity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In every argument with her mother, Susan had in point

<P>of reason the advantage, and never was there any maternal

<P>tenderness to buy her off.&nbsp; The blind fondness which was

<P>for ever producing evil around her she had never known.

<P>There was no gratitude for affection past or present

<P>to make her better bear with its excesses to the others.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>All this became gradually evident, and gradually placed

<P>Susan before her sister as an object of mingled compassion

<P>and respect.&nbsp; That her manner was wrong, however, at times

<P>very wrong, her measures often ill-chosen and ill-timed,

<P>and her looks and language very often indefensible,

<P>Fanny could not cease to feel; but she began to hope they

<P>might be rectified.&nbsp; Susan, she found, looked up to her

<P>and wished for her good opinion; and new as anything like an

<P>office of authority was to Fanny, new as it was to imagine

<P>herself capable of guiding or informing any one, she did

<P>resolve to give occasional hints to Susan, and endeavour

<P>to exercise for her advantage the juster notions of what was

<P>due to everybody, and what would be wisest for herself,

<P>which her own more favoured education had fixed in her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her influence, or at least the consciousness and use of it,

<P>originated in an act of kindness by Susan, which, after many

<P>hesitations of delicacy, she at last worked herself up to.

<P>It had very early occurred to her that a small sum

<P>of money might, perhaps, restore peace for ever on the

<P>sore subject of the silver knife, canvassed as it now

<P>was continually, and the riches which she was in possession

<P>of herself, her uncle having given her 10 at parting,

<P>made her as able as she was willing to be generous.

<P>But she was so wholly unused to confer favours,

<P>except on the very poor, so unpractised in removing evils,

<P>or bestowing kindnesses among her equals, and so fearful

<P>of appearing to elevate herself as a great lady at home,

<P>that it took some time to determine that it would not be

<P>unbecoming in her to make such a present.&nbsp; It was made,

<P>however, at last:&nbsp; a silver knife was bought for Betsey,

<P>and accepted with great delight, its newness giving it

<P>every advantage over the other that could be desired;

<P>Susan was established in the full possession of her own,

<P>Betsey handsomely declaring that now she had got one so much

<P>prettier herself, she should never want _that_ again; and no

<P>reproach seemed conveyed to the equally satisfied mother,

<P>which Fanny had almost feared to be impossible.&nbsp; The deed

<P>thoroughly answered:&nbsp; a source of domestic altercation

<P>was entirely done away, and it was the means of opening

<P>Susan's heart to her, and giving her something more to love

<P>and be interested in.&nbsp; Susan shewed that she had delicacy:

<P>pleased as she was to be mistress of property which she

<P>had been struggling for at least two years, she yet

<P>feared that her sister's judgment had been against her,

<P>and that a reproof was designed her for having so struggled

<P>as to make the purchase necessary for the tranquillity of

<P>the house.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her temper was open.&nbsp; She acknowledged her fears,

<P>blamed herself for having contended so warmly;

<P>and from that hour Fanny, understanding the worth of her

<P>disposition and perceiving how fully she was inclined

<P>to seek her good opinion and refer to her judgment,

<P>began to feel again the blessing of affection, and to

<P>entertain the hope of being useful to a mind so much in

<P>need of help, and so much deserving it.&nbsp; She gave advice,

<P>advice too sound to be resisted by a good understanding,

<P>and given so mildly and considerately as not to irritate

<P>an imperfect temper, and she had the happiness of observing

<P>its good effects not unfrequently.&nbsp; More was not expected

<P>by one who, while seeing all the obligation and expediency

<P>of submission and forbearance, saw also with sympathetic

<P>acuteness of feeling all that must be hourly grating

<P>to a girl like Susan.&nbsp; Her greatest wonder on the subject

<P>soon became--not that Susan should have been provoked into

<P>disrespect and impatience against her better knowledge--

<P>but that so much better knowledge, so many good notions

<P>should have been hers at all; and that, brought up in the

<P>midst of negligence and error, she should have formed

<P>such proper opinions of what ought to be; she, who had

<P>had no cousin Edmund to direct her thoughts or fix her principles.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The intimacy thus begun between them was a material

<P>advantage to each.&nbsp; By sitting together upstairs,

<P>they avoided a great deal of the disturbance of the house;

<P>Fanny had peace, and Susan learned to think it no

<P>misfortune to be quietly employed.&nbsp; They sat without

<P>a fire; but that was a privation familiar even to Fanny,

<P>and she suffered the less because reminded by it of

<P>the East room.&nbsp; It was the only point of resemblance.

<P>In space, light, furniture, and prospect, there was nothing

<P>alike in the two apartments; and she often heaved a sigh

<P>at the remembrance of all her books and boxes, and various

<P>comforts there.&nbsp; By degrees the girls came to spend the

<P>chief of the morning upstairs, at first only in working

<P>and talking, but after a few days, the remembrance of the

<P>said books grew so potent and stimulative that Fanny found

<P>it impossible not to try for books again.&nbsp; There were none

<P>in her father's house; but wealth is luxurious and daring,

<P>and some of hers found its way to a circulating library.

<P>She became a subscriber; amazed at being anything _in_

<P>_propria_ _persona_, amazed at her own doings in every way,

<P>to be a renter, a chuser of books!&nbsp; And to be having any

<P>one's improvement in view in her choice!&nbsp; But so it was.

<P>Susan had read nothing, and Fanny longed to give her

<P>a share in her own first pleasures, and inspire a taste

<P>for the biography and poetry which she delighted in herself.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In this occupation she hoped, moreover, to bury some

<P>of the recollections of Mansfield, which were too apt

<P>to seize her mind if her fingers only were busy;

<P>and, especially at this time, hoped it might be useful

<P>in diverting her thoughts from pursuing Edmund to London,

<P>whither, on the authority of her aunt's last letter,

<P>she knew he was gone.&nbsp; She had no doubt of what would ensue.

<P>The promised notification was hanging over her head.

<P>The postman's knock within the neighbourhood was beginning

<P>to bring its daily terrors, and if reading could banish

<P>the idea for even half an hour, it was something gained.
