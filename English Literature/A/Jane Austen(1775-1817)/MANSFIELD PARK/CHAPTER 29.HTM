<P>The ball was over, and the breakfast was soon over too;

<P>the last kiss was given, and William was gone.

<P>Mr. Crawford had, as he foretold, been very punctual,

<P>and short and pleasant had been the meal.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After seeing William to the last moment, Fanny walked

<P>back to the breakfast-room with a very saddened heart

<P>to grieve over the melancholy change; and there her uncle

<P>kindly left her to cry in peace, conceiving, perhaps,

<P>that the deserted chair of each young man might exercise

<P>her tender enthusiasm, and that the remaining cold pork

<P>bones and mustard in William's plate might but divide

<P>her feelings with the broken egg-shells in Mr. Crawford's.

<P>She sat and cried _con_ _amore_ as her uncle intended,

<P>but it was _con_ _amore_ fraternal and no other.

<P>William was gone, and she now felt as if she had wasted

<P>half his visit in idle cares and selfish solicitudes

<P>unconnected with him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny's disposition was such that she could never even think

<P>of her aunt Norris in the meagreness and cheerlessness

<P>of her own small house, without reproaching herself

<P>for some little want of attention to her when they had

<P>been last together; much less could her feelings acquit

<P>her of having done and said and thought everything

<P>by William that was due to him for a whole fortnight.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>It was a heavy, melancholy day.&nbsp; Soon after the second

<P>breakfast, Edmund bade them good-bye for a week, and mounted

<P>his horse for Peterborough, and then all were gone.

<P>Nothing remained of last night but remembrances, which she

<P>had nobody to share in.&nbsp; She talked to her aunt Bertram--

<P>she must talk to somebody of the ball; but her aunt had seen

<P>so little of what had passed, and had so little curiosity,

<P>that it was heavy work.&nbsp; Lady Bertram was not certain of

<P>anybody's dress or anybody's place at supper but her own.

<P>"She could not recollect what it was that she had heard

<P>about one of the Miss Maddoxes, or what it was that Lady

<P>Prescott had noticed in Fanny:&nbsp; she was not sure whether

<P>Colonel Harrison had been talking of Mr. Crawford or of

<P>William when he said he was the finest young man in the room--

<P>somebody had whispered something to her; she had forgot

<P>to ask Sir Thomas what it could be."&nbsp; And these were her

<P>longest speeches and clearest communications:&nbsp; the rest

<P>was only a languid "Yes, yes; very well; did you? did he?

<P>I did not see _that_; I should not know one from the other."

<P>This was very bad.&nbsp; It was only better than Mrs. Norris's

<P>sharp answers would have been; but she being gone home

<P>with all the supernumerary jellies to nurse a sick maid,

<P>there was peace and good-humour in their little party,

<P>though it could not boast much beside.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The evening was heavy like the day.&nbsp; "I cannot think

<P>what is the matter with me," said Lady Bertram,

<P>when the tea-things were removed.&nbsp; "I feel quite stupid.

<P>It must be sitting up so late last night.&nbsp; Fanny, you must

<P>do something to keep me awake.&nbsp; I cannot work.

<P>Fetch the cards; I feel so very stupid."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The cards were brought, and Fanny played at cribbage

<P>with her aunt till bedtime; and as Sir Thomas was reading

<P>to himself, no sounds were heard in the room for the next

<P>two hours beyond the reckonings of the game--"And _that_

<P>makes thirty-one; four in hand and eight in crib.

<P>You are to deal, ma'am; shall I deal for you?"&nbsp; Fanny thought

<P>and thought again of the difference which twenty-four hours

<P>had made in that room, and all that part of the house.

<P>Last night it had been hope and smiles, bustle and motion,

<P>noise and brilliancy, in the drawing-room, and out of

<P>the drawing-room, and everywhere.&nbsp; Now it was languor,

<P>and all but solitude.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A good night's rest improved her spirits.&nbsp; She could think

<P>of William the next day more cheerfully; and as the morning

<P>afforded her an opportunity of talking over Thursday night

<P>with Mrs. Grant and Miss Crawford, in a very handsome style,

<P>with all the heightenings of imagination, and all the

<P>laughs of playfulness which are so essential to the shade

<P>of a departed ball, she could afterwards bring her mind

<P>without much effort into its everyday state, and easily

<P>conform to the tranquillity of the present quiet week.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They were indeed a smaller party than she had ever

<P>known there for a whole day together, and _he_ was gone

<P>on whom the comfort and cheerfulness of every family

<P>meeting and every meal chiefly depended.&nbsp; But this must

<P>be learned to be endured.&nbsp; He would soon be always gone;

<P>and she was thankful that she could now sit in the same room

<P>with her uncle, hear his voice, receive his questions,

<P>and even answer them, without such wretched feelings

<P>as she had formerly known.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We miss our two young men," was Sir Thomas's observation

<P>on both the first and second day, as they formed their

<P>very reduced circle after dinner; and in consideration

<P>of Fanny's swimming eyes, nothing more was said

<P>on the first day than to drink their good health;

<P>but on the second it led to something farther.

<P>William was kindly commended and his promotion hoped for.

<P>"And there is no reason to suppose," added Sir Thomas,

<P>"but that his visits to us may now be tolerably frequent.

<P>As to Edmund, we must learn to do without him.

<P>This will be the last winter of his belonging to us,

<P>as he has done."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes," said Lady Bertram, "but I wish he was not going away.

<P>They are all going away, I think.&nbsp; I wish they would stay

<P>at home."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This wish was levelled principally at Julia, who had

<P>just applied for permission to go to town with Maria;

<P>and as Sir Thomas thought it best for each daughter that the

<P>permission should be granted, Lady Bertram, though in her own

<P>good-nature she would not have prevented it, was lamenting

<P>the change it made in the prospect of Julia's return,

<P>which would otherwise have taken place about this time.

<P>A great deal of good sense followed on Sir Thomas's side,

<P>tending to reconcile his wife to the arrangement.

<P>Everything that a considerate parent _ought_ to feel was

<P>advanced for her use; and everything that an affectionate

<P>mother _must_ feel in promoting her children's enjoyment

<P>was attributed to her nature.&nbsp; Lady Bertram agreed to it

<P>all with a calm "Yes"; and at the end of a quarter of

<P>an hour's silent consideration spontaneously observed,

<P>"Sir Thomas, I have been thinking--and I am very glad we

<P>took Fanny as we did, for now the others are away we feel

<P>the good of it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sir Thomas immediately improved this compliment by adding,

<P>"Very true.&nbsp; We shew Fanny what a good girl we think

<P>her by praising her to her face, she is now a very

<P>valuable companion.&nbsp; If we have been kind to _her_,

<P>she is now quite as necessary to _us_."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes," said Lady Bertram presently; "and it is a comfort

<P>to think that we shall always have _her_."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sir Thomas paused, half smiled, glanced at his niece,

<P>and then gravely replied, "She will never leave us, I hope,

<P>till invited to some other home that may reasonably promise

<P>her greater happiness than she knows here."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And _that_ is not very likely to be, Sir Thomas.

<P>Who should invite her?&nbsp; Maria might be very glad to see her

<P>at Sotherton now and then, but she would not think of asking

<P>her to live there; and I am sure she is better off here;

<P>and besides, I cannot do without her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The week which passed so quietly and peaceably at the

<P>great house in Mansfield had a very different character at

<P>the Parsonage.&nbsp; To the young lady, at least, in each family,

<P>it brought very different feelings.&nbsp; What was tranquillity

<P>and comfort to Fanny was tediousness and vexation to Mary.

<P>Something arose from difference of disposition and habit:

<P>one so easily satisfied, the other so unused to endure;

<P>but still more might be imputed to difference

<P>of circumstances.&nbsp; In some points of interest they

<P>were exactly opposed to each other.&nbsp; To Fanny's mind,

<P>Edmund's absence was really, in its cause and its tendency,

<P>a relief.&nbsp; To Mary it was every way painful.&nbsp; She felt

<P>the want of his society every day, almost every hour,

<P>and was too much in want of it to derive anything but

<P>irritation from considering the object for which he went.

<P>He could not have devised anything more likely to raise

<P>his consequence than this week's absence, occurring as

<P>it did at the very time of her brother's going away,

<P>of William Price's going too, and completing the sort

<P>of general break-up of a party which had been so animated.

<P>She felt it keenly.&nbsp; They were now a miserable trio,

<P>confined within doors by a series of rain and snow,

<P>with nothing to do and no variety to hope for.&nbsp; Angry as

<P>she was with Edmund for adhering to his own notions,

<P>and acting on them in defiance of her (and she had been

<P>so angry that they had hardly parted friends at the ball),

<P>she could not help thinking of him continually when absent,

<P>dwelling on his merit and affection, and longing again

<P>for the almost daily meetings they lately had.&nbsp; His absence

<P>was unnecessarily long.&nbsp; He should not have planned such

<P>an absence--he should not have left home for a week,

<P>when her own departure from Mansfield was so near.

<P>Then she began to blame herself.&nbsp; She wished she had not

<P>spoken so warmly in their last conversation.&nbsp; She was afraid

<P>she had used some strong, some contemptuous expressions

<P>in speaking of the clergy, and that should not have been.

<P>It was ill-bred; it was wrong.&nbsp; She wished such words unsaid

<P>with all her heart.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her vexation did not end with the week.&nbsp; All this was bad,

<P>but she had still more to feel when Friday came round

<P>again and brought no Edmund; when Saturday came and still

<P>no Edmund; and when, through the slight communication

<P>with the other family which Sunday produced, she learned

<P>that he had actually written home to defer his return,

<P>having promised to remain some days longer with his friend.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>If she had felt impatience and regret before--if she had

<P>been sorry for what she said, and feared its too strong

<P>effect on him--she now felt and feared it all tenfold more.

<P>She had, moreover, to contend with one disagreeable emotion

<P>entirely new to her--jealousy.&nbsp; His friend Mr. Owen had sisters;

<P>he might find them attractive.&nbsp; But, at any rate, his staying

<P>away at a time when, according to all preceding plans,

<P>she was to remove to London, meant something that she could

<P>not bear.&nbsp; Had Henry returned, as he talked of doing,

<P>at the end of three or four days, she should now have

<P>been leaving Mansfield.&nbsp; It became absolutely necessary

<P>for her to get to Fanny and try to learn something more.

<P>She could not live any longer in such solitary wretchedness;

<P>and she made her way to the Park, through difficulties

<P>of walking which she had deemed unconquerable a week before,

<P>for the chance of hearing a little in addition, for the

<P>sake of at least hearing his name.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The first half-hour was lost, for Fanny and Lady Bertram

<P>were together, and unless she had Fanny to herself she could

<P>hope for nothing.&nbsp; But at last Lady Bertram left the room,

<P>and then almost immediately Miss Crawford thus began,

<P>with a voice as well regulated as she could--"And how do

<P>_you_ like your cousin Edmund's staying away so long?

<P>Being the only young person at home, I consider _you_

<P>as the greatest sufferer.&nbsp; You must miss him.&nbsp; Does his

<P>staying longer surprise you?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not know," said Fanny hesitatingly.&nbsp; "Yes; I had

<P>not particularly expected it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Perhaps he will always stay longer than he talks of.

<P>It is the general way all young men do."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He did not, the only time he went to see Mr. Owen before."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"He finds the house more agreeable _now_. He is a very--

<P>a very pleasing young man himself, and I cannot help

<P>being rather concerned at not seeing him again before I

<P>go to London, as will now undoubtedly be the case.

<P>I am looking for Henry every day, and as soon as he

<P>comes there will be nothing to detain me at Mansfield.

<P>I should like to have seen him once more, I confess.

<P>But you must give my compliments to him.&nbsp; Yes; I think it must

<P>be compliments.&nbsp; Is not there a something wanted, Miss Price,

<P>in our language--a something between compliments and--

<P>and love--to suit the sort of friendly acquaintance we have

<P>had together?&nbsp; So many months' acquaintance!&nbsp; But compliments

<P>may be sufficient here.&nbsp; Was his letter a long one?

<P>Does he give you much account of what he is doing?

<P>Is it Christmas gaieties that he is staying for?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I only heard a part of the letter; it was to my uncle;

<P>but I believe it was very short; indeed I am sure it was

<P>but a few lines.&nbsp; All that I heard was that his friend

<P>had pressed him to stay longer, and that he had agreed

<P>to do so.&nbsp; A _few_ days longer, or _some_ days longer;

<P>I am not quite sure which."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! if he wrote to his father; but I thought it might

<P>have been to Lady Bertram or you.&nbsp; But if he wrote to

<P>his father, no wonder he was concise.&nbsp; Who could write

<P>chat to Sir Thomas?&nbsp; If he had written to you, there would

<P>have been more particulars.&nbsp; You would have heard of

<P>balls and parties.&nbsp; He would have sent you a description

<P>of everything and everybody.&nbsp; How many Miss Owens are there?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Three grown up."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Are they musical?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not at all know.&nbsp; I never heard."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That is the first question, you know," said Miss Crawford,

<P>trying to appear gay and unconcerned, "which every

<P>woman who plays herself is sure to ask about another.

<P>But it is very foolish to ask questions about any

<P>young ladies--about any three sisters just grown up;

<P>for one knows, without being told, exactly what they are:

<P>all very accomplished and pleasing, and one very pretty.

<P>There is a beauty in every family; it is a regular thing.

<P>Two play on the pianoforte, and one on the harp;

<P>and all sing, or would sing if they were taught,

<P>or sing all the better for not being taught; or something

<P>like it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I know nothing of the Miss Owens," said Fanny calmly.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You know nothing and you care less, as people say.

<P>Never did tone express indifference plainer.&nbsp; Indeed, how can

<P>one care for those one has never seen?&nbsp; Well, when your

<P>cousin comes back, he will find Mansfield very quiet;

<P>all the noisy ones gone, your brother and mine and myself

<P>I do not like the idea of leaving Mrs. Grant now the time

<P>draws near.&nbsp; She does not like my going."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny felt obliged to speak.&nbsp; "'You cannot doubt your being

<P>missed by many," said she.&nbsp; "You will be very much missed."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Miss Crawford turned her eye on her, as if wanting to hear

<P>or see more, and then laughingly said, "Oh yes! missed

<P>as every noisy evil is missed when it is taken away;

<P>that is, there is a great difference felt.&nbsp; But I am

<P>not fishing; don't compliment me.&nbsp; If I _am_ missed,

<P>it will appear.&nbsp; I may be discovered by those who want

<P>to see me.&nbsp; I shall not be in any doubtful, or distant,

<P>or unapproachable region."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now Fanny could not bring herself to speak, and Miss

<P>Crawford was disappointed; for she had hoped to hear

<P>some pleasant assurance of her power from one who she

<P>thought must know, and her spirits were clouded again.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The Miss Owens," said she, soon afterwards; "suppose you

<P>were to have one of the Miss Owens settled at Thornton Lacey;

<P>how should you like it?&nbsp; Stranger things have happened.

<P>I dare say they are trying for it.&nbsp; And they are quite

<P>in the light, for it would be a very pretty establishment

<P>for them.&nbsp; I do not at all wonder or blame them.&nbsp; It is

<P>everybody's duty to do as well for themselves as they can.

<P>Sir Thomas Bertram's son is somebody; and now he is in their

<P>own line.&nbsp; Their father is a clergyman, and their brother

<P>is a clergyman, and they are all clergymen together.

<P>He is their lawful property; he fairly belongs to them.

<P>You don't speak, Fanny; Miss Price, you don't speak.

<P>But honestly now, do not you rather expect it than otherwise?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No," said Fanny stoutly, "I do not expect it at all."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not at all!" cried Miss Crawford with alacrity.

<P>"I wonder at that.&nbsp; But I dare say you know exactly--

<P>I always imagine you are--perhaps you do not think him

<P>likely to marry at all--or not at present."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, I do not," said Fanny softly, hoping she did not err

<P>either in the belief or the acknowledgment of it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her companion looked at her keenly; and gathering greater

<P>spirit from the blush soon produced from such a look,

<P>only said, "He is best off as he is," and turned the subject.
