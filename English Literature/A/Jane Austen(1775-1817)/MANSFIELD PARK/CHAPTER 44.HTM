<P>Seven weeks of the two months were very nearly gone,

<P>when the one letter, the letter from Edmund, so long expected,

<P>was put into Fanny's hands.&nbsp; As she opened, and saw

<P>its length, she prepared herself for a minute detail

<P>of happiness and a profusion of love and praise towards

<P>the fortunate creature who was now mistress of his fate.

<P>These were the contents--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My Dear Fanny,--Excuse me that I have not written before.

<P>Crawford told me that you were wishing to hear from me,

<P>but I found it impossible to write from London,

<P>and persuaded myself that you would understand my silence.

<P>Could I have sent a few happy lines, they should not

<P>have been wanting, but nothing of that nature was ever

<P>in my power.&nbsp; I am returned to Mansfield in a less assured

<P>state that when I left it.&nbsp; My hopes are much weaker.

<P>You are probably aware of this already.&nbsp; So very fond of you

<P>as Miss Crawford is, it is most natural that she should tell

<P>you enough of her own feelings to furnish a tolerable guess

<P>at mine.&nbsp; I will not be prevented, however, from making my

<P>own communication.&nbsp; Our confidences in you need not clash.

<P>I ask no questions.&nbsp; There is something soothing in the

<P>idea that we have the same friend, and that whatever

<P>unhappy differences of opinion may exist between us,

<P>we are united in our love of you.&nbsp; It will be a comfort

<P>to me to tell you how things now are, and what are my

<P>present plans, if plans I can be said to have.&nbsp; I have been

<P>returned since Saturday.&nbsp; I was three weeks in London,

<P>and saw her (for London) very often.&nbsp; I had every attention

<P>from the Frasers that could be reasonably expected.

<P>I dare say I was not reasonable in carrying with me

<P>hopes of an intercourse at all like that of Mansfield.

<P>It was her manner, however, rather than any unfrequency

<P>of meeting.&nbsp; Had she been different when I did see her,

<P>I should have made no complaint, but from the very first

<P>she was altered:&nbsp; my first reception was so unlike

<P>what I had hoped, that I had almost resolved on leaving

<P>London again directly.&nbsp; I need not particularise.

<P>You know the weak side of her character, and may imagine

<P>the sentiments and expressions which were torturing me.

<P>She was in high spirits, and surrounded by those who

<P>were giving all the support of their own bad sense

<P>to her too lively mind.&nbsp; I do not like Mrs. Fraser.

<P>She is a cold-hearted, vain woman, who has married entirely

<P>from convenience, and though evidently unhappy in her marriage,

<P>places her disappointment not to faults of judgment,

<P>or temper, or disproportion of age, but to her being,

<P>after all, less affluent than many of her acquaintance,

<P>especially than her sister, Lady Stornaway, and is the

<P>determined supporter of everything mercenary and ambitious,

<P>provided it be only mercenary and ambitious enough.&nbsp; I look

<P>upon her intimacy with those two sisters as the greatest

<P>misfortune of her life and mine.&nbsp; They have been leading

<P>her astray for years.&nbsp; Could she be detached from them!--

<P>and sometimes I do not despair of it, for the affection

<P>appears to me principally on their side.&nbsp; They are very

<P>fond of her; but I am sure she does not love them as she

<P>loves you.&nbsp; When I think of her great attachment to you,

<P>indeed, and the whole of her judicious, upright conduct

<P>as a sister, she appears a very different creature,

<P>capable of everything noble, and I am ready to blame

<P>myself for a too harsh construction of a playful manner.

<P>I cannot give her up, Fanny.&nbsp; She is the only woman

<P>in the world whom I could ever think of as a wife.

<P>If I did not believe that she had some regard for me,

<P>of course I should not say this, but I do believe it.

<P>I am convinced that she is not without a decided preference.

<P>I have no jealousy of any individual.&nbsp; It is the influence

<P>of the fashionable world altogether that I am jealous of.

<P>It is the habits of wealth that I fear.&nbsp; Her ideas are

<P>not higher than her own fortune may warrant, but they

<P>are beyond what our incomes united could authorise.

<P>There is comfort, however, even here.&nbsp; I could better

<P>bear to lose her because not rich enough, than because

<P>of my profession.&nbsp; That would only prove her affection

<P>not equal to sacrifices, which, in fact, I am scarcely

<P>justified in asking; and, if I am refused, that, I think,

<P>will be the honest motive.&nbsp; Her prejudices, I trust,

<P>are not so strong as they were.&nbsp; You have my thoughts

<P>exactly as they arise, my dear Fanny; perhaps they are

<P>sometimes contradictory, but it will not be a less faithful

<P>picture of my mind.&nbsp; Having once begun, it is a pleasure

<P>to me to tell you all I feel.&nbsp; I cannot give her up.

<P>Connected as we already are, and, I hope, are to be,

<P>to give up Mary Crawford would be to give up the society

<P>of some of those most dear to me; to banish myself from

<P>the very houses and friends whom, under any other distress,

<P>I should turn to for consolation.&nbsp; The loss of Mary I must

<P>consider as comprehending the loss of Crawford and of Fanny.

<P>Were it a decided thing, an actual refusal, I hope I

<P>should know how to bear it, and how to endeavour to weaken

<P>her hold on my heart, and in the course of a few years--

<P>but I am writing nonsense.&nbsp; Were I refused, I must bear it;

<P>and till I am, I can never cease to try for her.

<P>This is the truth.&nbsp; The only question is _how_?&nbsp; What may

<P>be the likeliest means?&nbsp; I have sometimes thought of going

<P>to London again after Easter, and sometimes resolved on

<P>doing nothing till she returns to Mansfield.&nbsp; Even now,

<P>she speaks with pleasure of being in Mansfield in June;

<P>but June is at a great distance, and I believe I shall

<P>write to her.&nbsp; I have nearly determined on explaining

<P>myself by letter.&nbsp; To be at an early certainty is a

<P>material object.&nbsp; My present state is miserably irksome.

<P>Considering everything, I think a letter will be decidedly

<P>the best method of explanation.&nbsp; I shall be able to write

<P>much that I could not say, and shall be giving her time

<P>for reflection before she resolves on her answer,

<P>and I am less afraid of the result of reflection

<P>than of an immediate hasty impulse; I think I am.

<P>My greatest danger would lie in her consulting Mrs. Fraser,

<P>and I at a distance unable to help my own cause.

<P>A letter exposes to all the evil of consultation,

<P>and where the mind is anything short of perfect decision,

<P>an adviser may, in an unlucky moment, lead it to do what it

<P>may afterwards regret.&nbsp; I must think this matter over

<P>a little.&nbsp; This long letter, full of my own concerns alone,

<P>will be enough to tire even the friendship of a Fanny.

<P>The last time I saw Crawford was at Mrs. Fraser's party.

<P>I am more and more satisfied with all that I see and hear

<P>of him.&nbsp; There is not a shadow of wavering.&nbsp; He thoroughly

<P>knows his own mind, and acts up to his resolutions:

<P>an inestimable quality.&nbsp; I could not see him and my eldest

<P>sister in the same room without recollecting what you

<P>once told me, and I acknowledge that they did not meet

<P>as friends.&nbsp; There was marked coolness on her side.

<P>They scarcely spoke.&nbsp; I saw him draw back surprised,

<P>and I was sorry that Mrs. Rushworth should resent any

<P>former supposed slight to Miss Bertram.&nbsp; You will wish

<P>to hear my opinion of Maria's degree of comfort as a wife.

<P>There is no appearance of unhappiness.&nbsp; I hope they get

<P>on pretty well together.&nbsp; I dined twice in Wimpole Street,

<P>and might have been there oftener, but it is mortifying

<P>to be with Rushworth as a brother.&nbsp; Julia seems to enjoy

<P>London exceedingly.&nbsp; I had little enjoyment there,

<P>but have less here.&nbsp; We are not a lively party.&nbsp; You are

<P>very much wanted.&nbsp; I miss you more than I can express.

<P>My mother desires her best love, and hopes to hear

<P>from you soon.&nbsp; She talks of you almost every hour,

<P>and I am sorry to find how many weeks more she is likely

<P>to be without you.&nbsp; My father means to fetch you himself,

<P>but it will not be till after Easter, when he has

<P>business in town.&nbsp; You are happy at Portsmouth, I hope,

<P>but this must not be a yearly visit.&nbsp; I want you at home,

<P>that I may have your opinion about Thornton Lacey.

<P>I have little heart for extensive improvements till

<P>I know that it will ever have a mistress.&nbsp; I think I

<P>shall certainly write.&nbsp; It is quite settled that the

<P>Grants go to Bath; they leave Mansfield on Monday.

<P>I am glad of it.&nbsp; I am not comfortable enough to be fit

<P>for anybody; but your aunt seems to feel out of luck

<P>that such an article of Mansfield news should fall

<P>to my pen instead of hers.--Yours ever, my dearest

<P>Fanny."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I never will, no, I certainly never will wish for a

<P>letter again," was Fanny's secret declaration as she

<P>finished this.&nbsp; "What do they bring but disappointment

<P>and sorrow?&nbsp; Not till after Easter!&nbsp; How shall I bear it?

<P>And my poor aunt talking of me every hour!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny checked the tendency of these thoughts as well as

<P>she could, but she was within half a minute of starting

<P>the idea that Sir Thomas was quite unkind, both to her aunt

<P>and to herself.&nbsp; As for the main subject of the letter,

<P>there was nothing in that to soothe irritation.&nbsp; She was

<P>almost vexed into displeasure and anger against Edmund.

<P>"There is no good in this delay," said she.&nbsp; "Why is not

<P>it settled?&nbsp; He is blinded, and nothing will open his eyes;

<P>nothing can, after having had truths before him so long

<P>in vain.&nbsp; He will marry her, and be poor and miserable.

<P>God grant that her influence do not make him cease

<P>to be respectable!"&nbsp; She looked over the letter again.

<P>"'So very fond of me!' 'tis nonsense all.&nbsp; She loves

<P>nobody but herself and her brother.&nbsp; Her friends leading

<P>her astray for years!&nbsp; She is quite as likely to have led

<P>_them_ astray.&nbsp; They have all, perhaps, been corrupting

<P>one another; but if they are so much fonder of her than

<P>she is of them, she is the less likely to have been hurt,

<P>except by their flattery.&nbsp; 'The only woman in the world

<P>whom he could ever think of as a wife.'&nbsp; I firmly

<P>believe it.&nbsp; It is an attachment to govern his whole life.

<P>Accepted or refused, his heart is wedded to her for ever.

<P>'The loss of Mary I must consider as comprehending the loss

<P>of Crawford and Fanny.'&nbsp; Edmund, you do not know me.

<P>The families would never be connected if you did not

<P>connect them!&nbsp; Oh! write, write.&nbsp; Finish it at once.

<P>Let there be an end of this suspense.&nbsp; Fix, commit,

<P>condemn yourself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Such sensations, however, were too near akin to

<P>resentment to be long guiding Fanny's soliloquies.

<P>She was soon more softened and sorrowful.&nbsp; His warm regard,

<P>his kind expressions, his confidential treatment,

<P>touched her strongly.&nbsp; He was only too good to everybody.

<P>It was a letter, in short, which she would not but have had

<P>for the world, and which could never be valued enough.

<P>This was the end of it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Everybody at all addicted to letter-writing, without

<P>having much to say, which will include a large proportion

<P>of the female world at least, must feel with Lady Bertram

<P>that she was out of luck in having such a capital piece of

<P>Mansfield news as the certainty of the Grants going to Bath,

<P>occur at a time when she could make no advantage of it,

<P>and will admit that it must have been very mortifying

<P>to her to see it fall to the share of her thankless son,

<P>and treated as concisely as possible at the end of a

<P>long letter, instead of having it to spread over the largest

<P>part of a page of her own.&nbsp; For though Lady Bertram rather

<P>shone in the epistolary line, having early in her marriage,

<P>from the want of other employment, and the circumstance

<P>of Sir Thomas's being in Parliament, got into the way

<P>of making and keeping correspondents, and formed for

<P>herself a very creditable, common-place, amplifying style,

<P>so that a very little matter was enough for her:&nbsp; she could

<P>not do entirely without any; she must have something

<P>to write about, even to her niece; and being so soon

<P>to lose all the benefit of Dr. Grant's gouty symptoms

<P>and Mrs. Grant's morning calls, it was very hard upon her

<P>to be deprived of one of the last epistolary uses she could put

<P>them to.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>There was a rich amends, however, preparing for her.

<P>Lady Bertram's hour of good luck came.&nbsp; Within a few days

<P>from the receipt of Edmund's letter, Fanny had one from

<P>her aunt, beginning thus--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My Dear Fanny,--I take up my pen to communicate some

<P>very alarming intelligence, which I make no doubt will

<P>give you much concern".
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>This was a great deal better than to have to take up the pen

<P>to acquaint her with all the particulars of the Grants'

<P>intended journey, for the present intelligence was of a

<P>nature to promise occupation for the pen for many days

<P>to come, being no less than the dangerous illness of her

<P>eldest son, of which they had received notice by express

<P>a few hours before.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Tom had gone from London with a party of young men

<P>to Newmarket, where a neglected fall and a good deal

<P>of drinking had brought on a fever; and when the party

<P>broke up, being unable to move, had been left by himself

<P>at the house of one of these young men to the comforts of

<P>sickness and solitude, and the attendance only of servants.

<P>Instead of being soon well enough to follow his friends,

<P>as he had then hoped, his disorder increased considerably,

<P>and it was not long before he thought so ill of himself

<P>as to be as ready as his physician to have a letter

<P>despatched to Mansfield.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This distressing intelligence, as you may suppose,"

<P>observed her ladyship, after giving the substance of it,

<P>"has agitated us exceedingly, and we cannot prevent

<P>ourselves from being greatly alarmed and apprehensive

<P>for the poor invalid, whose state Sir Thomas fears may

<P>be very critical; and Edmund kindly proposes attending

<P>his brother immediately, but I am happy to add that Sir

<P>Thomas will not leave me on this distressing occasion,

<P>as it would be too trying for me.&nbsp; We shall greatly miss

<P>Edmund in our small circle, but I trust and hope he

<P>will find the poor invalid in a less alarming state than

<P>might be apprehended, and that he will be able to bring

<P>him to Mansfield shortly, which Sir Thomas proposes

<P>should be done, and thinks best on every account, and I

<P>flatter myself the poor sufferer will soon be able to bear

<P>the removal without material inconvenience or injury.

<P>As I have little doubt of your feeling for us, my dear Fanny,

<P>under these distressing circumstances, I will write again

<P>very soon."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny's feelings on the occasion were indeed considerably

<P>more warm and genuine than her aunt's style of writing.

<P>She felt truly for them all.&nbsp; Tom dangerously ill,

<P>Edmund gone to attend him, and the sadly small party

<P>remaining at Mansfield, were cares to shut out every

<P>other care, or almost every other.&nbsp; She could just find

<P>selfishness enough to wonder whether Edmund _had_ written

<P>to Miss Crawford before this summons came, but no sentiment

<P>dwelt long with her that was not purely affectionate and

<P>disinterestedly anxious.&nbsp; Her aunt did not neglect her:

<P>she wrote again and again; they were receiving frequent

<P>accounts from Edmund, and these accounts were as regularly

<P>transmitted to Fanny, in the same diffuse style,

<P>and the same medley of trusts, hopes, and fears,

<P>all following and producing each other at haphazard.

<P>It was a sort of playing at being frightened.

<P>The sufferings which Lady Bertram did not see had little

<P>power over her fancy; and she wrote very comfortably

<P>about agitation, and anxiety, and poor invalids, till Tom

<P>was actually conveyed to Mansfield, and her own eyes had

<P>beheld his altered appearance.&nbsp; Then a letter which she

<P>had been previously preparing for Fanny was finished

<P>in a different style, in the language of real feeling

<P>and alarm; then she wrote as she might have spoken.

<P>"He is just come, my dear Fanny, and is taken upstairs;

<P>and I am so shocked to see him, that I do not know

<P>what to do.&nbsp; I am sure he has been very ill.&nbsp; Poor Tom!

<P>I am quite grieved for him, and very much frightened,

<P>and so is Sir Thomas; and how glad I should be if you

<P>were here to comfort me.&nbsp; But Sir Thomas hopes he

<P>will be better to-morrow, and says we must consider

<P>his journey."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The real solicitude now awakened in the maternal bosom

<P>was not soon over.&nbsp; Tom's extreme impatience to be

<P>removed to Mansfield, and experience those comforts

<P>of home and family which had been little thought of in

<P>uninterrupted health, had probably induced his being

<P>conveyed thither too early, as a return of fever came on,

<P>and for a week he was in a more alarming state than ever.

<P>They were all very seriously frightened.&nbsp; Lady Bertram

<P>wrote her daily terrors to her niece, who might now be said

<P>to live upon letters, and pass all her time between suffering

<P>from that of to-day and looking forward to to-morrow's.

<P>Without any particular affection for her eldest cousin,

<P>her tenderness of heart made her feel that she could

<P>not spare him, and the purity of her principles added yet

<P>a keener solicitude, when she considered how little useful,

<P>how little self-denying his life had (apparently) been.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Susan was her only companion and listener on this, as on

<P>more common occasions.&nbsp; Susan was always ready to hear and

<P>to sympathise.&nbsp; Nobody else could be interested in so remote

<P>an evil as illness in a family above an hundred miles off;

<P>not even Mrs. Price, beyond a brief question or two,

<P>if she saw her daughter with a letter in her hand,

<P>and now and then the quiet observation of, "My poor

<P>sister Bertram must be in a great deal of trouble."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>So long divided and so differently situated, the ties

<P>of blood were little more than nothing.&nbsp; An attachment,

<P>originally as tranquil as their tempers, was now become

<P>a mere name.&nbsp; Mrs. Price did quite as much for Lady

<P>Bertram as Lady Bertram would have done for Mrs. Price.

<P>Three or four Prices might have been swept away,

<P>any or all except Fanny and William, and Lady Bertram

<P>would have thought little about it; or perhaps might have

<P>caught from Mrs. Norris's lips the cant of its being

<P>a very happy thing and a great blessing to their poor

<P>dear sister Price to have them so well provided for.
