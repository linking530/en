<P>The young people were pleased with each other from

<P>the first.&nbsp; On each side there was much to attract,

<P>and their acquaintance soon promised as early an intimacy

<P>as good manners would warrant.&nbsp; Miss Crawford's

<P>beauty did her no disservice with the Miss Bertrams.

<P>They were too handsome themselves to dislike any woman

<P>for being so too, and were almost as much charmed as their

<P>brothers with her lively dark eye, clear brown complexion,

<P>and general prettiness.&nbsp; Had she been tall, full formed,

<P>and fair, it might have been more of a trial:&nbsp; but as it was,

<P>there could be no comparison; and she was most allowably

<P>a sweet, pretty girl, while they were the finest young

<P>women in the country.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her brother was not handsome:&nbsp; no, when they first saw him

<P>he was absolutely plain, black and plain; but still he

<P>was the gentleman, with a pleasing address.&nbsp; The second

<P>meeting proved him not so very plain:&nbsp; he was plain,

<P>to be sure, but then he had so much countenance, and his

<P>teeth were so good, and he was so well made, that one

<P>soon forgot he was plain; and after a third interview,

<P>after dining in company with him at the Parsonage,

<P>he was no longer allowed to be called so by anybody.

<P>He was, in fact, the most agreeable young man the sisters

<P>had ever known, and they were equally delighted with him.

<P>Miss Bertram's engagement made him in equity the property

<P>of Julia, of which Julia was fully aware; and before he had

<P>been at Mansfield a week, she was quite ready to be fallen

<P>in love with.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Maria's notions on the subject were more confused

<P>and indistinct.&nbsp; She did not want to see or understand.

<P>"There could be no harm in her liking an agreeable man--

<P>everybody knew her situation--Mr. Crawford must take care

<P>of himself."&nbsp; Mr. Crawford did not mean to be in any danger!

<P>the Miss Bertrams were worth pleasing, and were ready

<P>to be pleased; and he began with no object but of making

<P>them like him.&nbsp; He did not want them to die of love;

<P>but with sense and temper which ought to have made him

<P>judge and feel better, he allowed himself great latitude

<P>on such points.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I like your Miss Bertrams exceedingly, sister," said he,

<P>as he returned from attending them to their carriage

<P>after the said dinner visit; "they are very elegant,

<P>agreeable girls."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So they are indeed, and I am delighted to hear you say it.

<P>But you like Julia best."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh yes!&nbsp; I like Julia best."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But do you really? for Miss Bertram is in general thought

<P>the handsomest."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"So I should suppose.&nbsp; She has the advantage in every feature,

<P>and I prefer her countenance; but I like Julia best;

<P>Miss Bertram is certainly the handsomest, and I have found

<P>her the most agreeable, but I shall always like Julia best,

<P>because you order me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I shall not talk to you, Henry, but I know you _will_

<P>like her best at last."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do not I tell you that I like her best _at_ _first_?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And besides, Miss Bertram is engaged.&nbsp; Remember that,

<P>my dear brother.&nbsp; Her choice is made."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, and I like her the better for it.&nbsp; An engaged

<P>woman is always more agreeable than a disengaged.

<P>She is satisfied with herself.&nbsp; Her cares are over,

<P>and she feels that she may exert all her powers of pleasing

<P>without suspicion.&nbsp; All is safe with a lady engaged:

<P>no harm can be done."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why, as to that, Mr. Rushworth is a very good sort

<P>of young man, and it is a great match for her."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But Miss Bertram does not care three straws for him;

<P>_that_ is your opinion of your intimate friend.&nbsp; _I_ do

<P>not subscribe to it.&nbsp; I am sure Miss Bertram is very much

<P>attached to Mr. Rushworth.&nbsp; I could see it in her eyes,

<P>when he was mentioned.&nbsp; I think too well of Miss Bertram

<P>to suppose she would ever give her hand without her heart."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Mary, how shall we manage him?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We must leave him to himself, I believe.&nbsp; Talking does

<P>no good.&nbsp; He will be taken in at last."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But I would not have him _taken_ _in_; I would not have

<P>him duped; I would have it all fair and honourable."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh dear! let him stand his chance and be taken in.

<P>It will do just as well.&nbsp; Everybody is taken in at some

<P>period or other."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not always in marriage, dear Mary."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"In marriage especially.&nbsp; With all due respect to such

<P>of the present company as chance to be married, my dear

<P>Mrs. Grant, there is not one in a hundred of either sex

<P>who is not taken in when they marry.&nbsp; Look where I will,

<P>I see that it _is_ so; and I feel that it _must_ be so,

<P>when I consider that it is, of all transactions, the one

<P>in which people expect most from others, and are least

<P>honest themselves."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah!&nbsp; You have been in a bad school for matrimony,

<P>in Hill Street."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My poor aunt had certainly little cause to love

<P>the state; but, however, speaking from my own observation,

<P>it is a manoeuvring business.&nbsp; I know so many who

<P>have married in the full expectation and confidence

<P>of some one particular advantage in the connexion,

<P>or accomplishment, or good quality in the person, who have

<P>found themselves entirely deceived, and been obliged

<P>to put up with exactly the reverse.&nbsp; What is this but a take in?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear child, there must be a little imagination here.

<P>I beg your pardon, but I cannot quite believe you.

<P>Depend upon it, you see but half.&nbsp; You see the evil,

<P>but you do not see the consolation.&nbsp; There will be

<P>little rubs and disappointments everywhere, and we

<P>are all apt to expect too much; but then, if one scheme

<P>of happiness fails, human nature turns to another;

<P>if the first calculation is wrong, we make a second better:

<P>we find comfort somewhere--and those evil-minded observers,

<P>dearest Mary, who make much of a little, are more taken

<P>in and deceived than the parties themselves."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well done, sister!&nbsp; I honour your _esprit_ _du_ _corps_.

<P>When I am a wife, I mean to be just as staunch myself;

<P>and I wish my friends in general would be so too.&nbsp; It would

<P>save me many a heartache."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You are as bad as your brother, Mary; but we will cure

<P>you both.&nbsp; Mansfield shall cure you both, and without

<P>any taking in.&nbsp; Stay with us, and we will cure you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The Crawfords, without wanting to be cured, were very

<P>willing to stay.&nbsp; Mary was satisfied with the Parsonage

<P>as a present home, and Henry equally ready to lengthen

<P>his visit.&nbsp; He had come, intending to spend only a few

<P>days with them; but Mansfield promised well, and there

<P>was nothing to call him elsewhere.&nbsp; It delighted Mrs. Grant

<P>to keep them both with her, and Dr. Grant was exceedingly

<P>well contented to have it so:&nbsp; a talking pretty young

<P>woman like Miss Crawford is always pleasant society

<P>to an indolent, stay-at-home man; and Mr. Crawford's

<P>being his guest was an excuse for drinking claret every day.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The Miss Bertrams' admiration of Mr. Crawford was more

<P>rapturous than anything which Miss Crawford's habits made

<P>her likely to feel.&nbsp; She acknowledged, however, that the

<P>Mr. Bertrams were very fine young men, that two such

<P>young men were not often seen together even in London,

<P>and that their manners, particularly those of the eldest,

<P>were very good.&nbsp; _He_ had been much in London,

<P>and had more liveliness and gallantry than Edmund,

<P>and must, therefore, be preferred; and, indeed, his being

<P>the eldest was another strong claim.&nbsp; She had felt an early

<P>presentiment that she _should_ like the eldest best.

<P>She knew it was her way.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Tom Bertram must have been thought pleasant, indeed, at any rate;

<P>he was the sort of young man to be generally liked,

<P>his agreeableness was of the kind to be oftener found

<P>agreeable than some endowments of a higher stamp, for he

<P>had easy manners, excellent spirits, a large acquaintance,

<P>and a great deal to say; and the reversion of Mansfield Park,

<P>and a baronetcy, did no harm to all this.&nbsp; Miss Crawford

<P>soon felt that he and his situation might do.&nbsp; She looked

<P>about her with due consideration, and found almost everything

<P>in his favour:&nbsp; a park, a real park, five miles round,

<P>a spacious modern-built house, so well placed and well

<P>screened as to deserve to be in any collection of engravings

<P>of gentlemen's seats in the kingdom, and wanting only to be

<P>completely new furnished--pleasant sisters, a quiet mother,

<P>and an agreeable man himself--with the advantage of

<P>being tied up from much gaming at present by a promise

<P>to his father, and of being Sir Thomas hereafter.

<P>It might do very well; she believed she should accept him;

<P>and she began accordingly to interest herself a little

<P>about the horse which he had to run at the B------- races.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>These races were to call him away not long after their

<P>acquaintance began; and as it appeared that the family

<P>did not, from his usual goings on, expect him back

<P>again for many weeks, it would bring his passion to an

<P>early proof.&nbsp; Much was said on his side to induce her

<P>to attend the races, and schemes were made for a large

<P>party to them, with all the eagerness of inclination,

<P>but it would only do to be talked of.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And Fanny, what was _she_ doing and thinking all this

<P>while? and what was _her_ opinion of the newcomers?

<P>Few young ladies of eighteen could be less called on

<P>to speak their opinion than Fanny.&nbsp; In a quiet way,

<P>very little attended to, she paid her tribute of admiration

<P>to Miss Crawford's beauty; but as she still continued

<P>to think Mr. Crawford very plain, in spite of her two

<P>cousins having repeatedly proved the contrary, she never

<P>mentioned _him_.&nbsp; The notice, which she excited herself,

<P>was to this effect.&nbsp; "I begin now to understand you all,

<P>except Miss Price," said Miss Crawford, as she was

<P>walking with the Mr. Bertrams.&nbsp; "Pray, is she out,

<P>or is she not?&nbsp; I am puzzled.&nbsp; She dined at the Parsonage,

<P>with the rest of you, which seemed like being _out_;

<P>and yet she says so little, that I can hardly suppose

<P>she _is_."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Edmund, to whom this was chiefly addressed, replied, "I believe

<P>I know what you mean, but I will not undertake to answer

<P>the question.&nbsp; My cousin is grown up.&nbsp; She has the age

<P>and sense of a woman, but the outs and not outs are beyond me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And yet, in general, nothing can be more easily ascertained.

<P>The distinction is so broad.&nbsp; Manners as well as

<P>appearance are, generally speaking, so totally different.

<P>Till now, I could not have supposed it possible to be

<P>mistaken as to a girl's being out or not.&nbsp; A girl not

<P>out has always the same sort of dress:&nbsp; a close bonnet,

<P>for instance; looks very demure, and never says a word.

<P>You may smile, but it is so, I assure you; and except

<P>that it is sometimes carried a little too far, it is

<P>all very proper.&nbsp; Girls should be quiet and modest.

<P>The most objectionable part is, that the alteration

<P>of manners on being introduced into company is frequently

<P>too sudden.&nbsp; They sometimes pass in such very little

<P>time from reserve to quite the opposite--to confidence!

<P>_That_ is the faulty part of the present system.

<P>One does not like to see a girl of eighteen or nineteen

<P>so immediately up to every thing--and perhaps when one

<P>has seen her hardly able to speak the year before.

<P>Mr. Bertram, I dare say _you_ have sometimes met with

<P>such changes."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I believe I have, but this is hardly fair; I see what you

<P>are at.&nbsp; You are quizzing me and Miss Anderson."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, indeed.&nbsp; Miss Anderson!&nbsp; I do not know who or what

<P>you mean.&nbsp; I am quite in the dark.&nbsp; But I _will_ quiz you

<P>with a great deal of pleasure, if you will tell me what about."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ah! you carry it off very well, but I cannot be quite

<P>so far imposed on.&nbsp; You must have had Miss Anderson

<P>in your eye, in describing an altered young lady.

<P>You paint too accurately for mistake.&nbsp; It was exactly so.

<P>The Andersons of Baker Street.&nbsp; We were speaking of them

<P>the other day, you know.&nbsp; Edmund, you have heard me mention

<P>Charles Anderson.&nbsp; The circumstance was precisely as this

<P>lady has represented it.&nbsp; When Anderson first introduced

<P>me to his family, about two years ago, his sister was

<P>not _out_, and I could not get her to speak to me.

<P>I sat there an hour one morning waiting for Anderson,

<P>with only her and a little girl or two in the room,

<P>the governess being sick or run away, and the mother

<P>in and out every moment with letters of business, and I

<P>could hardly get a word or a look from the young lady--

<P>nothing like a civil answer--she screwed up her mouth,

<P>and turned from me with such an air!&nbsp; I did not see

<P>her again for a twelvemonth.&nbsp; She was then _out_.

<P>I met her at Mrs. Holford's, and did not recollect her.

<P>She came up to me, claimed me as an acquaintance, stared me

<P>out of countenance; and talked and laughed till I did not

<P>know which way to look.&nbsp; I felt that I must be the jest

<P>of the room at the time, and Miss Crawford, it is plain,

<P>has heard the story."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"And a very pretty story it is, and with more truth

<P>in it, I dare say, than does credit to Miss Anderson.

<P>It is too common a fault.&nbsp; Mothers certainly have not yet

<P>got quite the right way of managing their daughters.

<P>I do not know where the error lies.&nbsp; I do not pretend to set

<P>people right, but I do see that they are often wrong."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Those who are showing the world what female manners

<P>_should_ be," said Mr. Bertram gallantly, "are doing

<P>a great deal to set them right."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The error is plain enough," said the less courteous Edmund;

<P>"such girls are ill brought up.&nbsp; They are given wrong notions

<P>from the beginning.&nbsp; They are always acting upon motives

<P>of vanity, and there is no more real modesty in their

<P>behaviour _before_ they appear in public than afterwards."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not know," replied Miss Crawford hesitatingly.

<P>"Yes, I cannot agree with you there.&nbsp; It is certainly

<P>the modestest part of the business.&nbsp; It is much worse to

<P>have girls not out give themselves the same airs and take

<P>the same liberties as if they were, which I have seen done.

<P>That is worse than anything--quite disgusting!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, _that_ is very inconvenient indeed," said Mr. Bertram.

<P>"It leads one astray; one does not know what to do.

<P>The close bonnet and demure air you describe so well (and

<P>nothing was ever juster), tell one what is expected;

<P>but I got into a dreadful scrape last year from the want

<P>of them.&nbsp; I went down to Ramsgate for a week with a friend

<P>last September, just after my return from the West Indies.

<P>My friend Sneyd--you have heard me speak of Sneyd, Edmund--

<P>his father, and mother, and sisters, were there, all new

<P>to me.&nbsp; When we reached Albion Place they were out;

<P>we went after them, and found them on the pier:&nbsp; Mrs. and

<P>the two Miss Sneyds, with others of their acquaintance.

<P>I made my bow in form; and as Mrs. Sneyd was surrounded

<P>by men, attached myself to one of her daughters,

<P>walked by her side all the way home, and made myself

<P>as agreeable as I could; the young lady perfectly easy

<P>in her manners, and as ready to talk as to listen.

<P>I had not a suspicion that I could be doing anything wrong.

<P>They looked just the same:&nbsp; both well-dressed, with veils

<P>and parasols like other girls; but I afterwards found

<P>that I had been giving all my attention to the youngest,

<P>who was not _out_, and had most excessively offended

<P>the eldest.&nbsp; Miss Augusta ought not to have been noticed

<P>for the next six months; and Miss Sneyd, I believe, has never

<P>forgiven me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That was bad indeed.&nbsp; Poor Miss Sneyd.&nbsp; "Though I have no

<P>younger sister, I feel for her.&nbsp; To be neglected before

<P>one's time must be very vexatious; but it was entirely

<P>the mother's fault.&nbsp; Miss Augusta should have been with

<P>her governess.&nbsp; Such half-and-half doings never prosper.

<P>But now I must be satisfied about Miss Price.

<P>Does she go to balls?&nbsp; Does she dine out every where,

<P>as well as at my sister's?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No," replied Edmund; "I do not think she has ever been

<P>to a ball.&nbsp; My mother seldom goes into company herself,

<P>and dines nowhere but with Mrs. Grant, and Fanny stays at

<P>home with _her_."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! then the point is clear.&nbsp; Miss Price is not out."
