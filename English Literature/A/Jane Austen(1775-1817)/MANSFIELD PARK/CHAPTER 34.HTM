<P>Edmund had great things to hear on his return.&nbsp; Many surprises

<P>were awaiting him.&nbsp; The first that occurred was not least

<P>in interest:&nbsp; the appearance of Henry Crawford and his sister

<P>walking together through the village as he rode into it.

<P>He had concluded--he had meant them to be far distant.

<P>His absence had been extended beyond a fortnight purposely

<P>to avoid Miss Crawford.&nbsp; He was returning to Mansfield

<P>with spirits ready to feed on melancholy remembrances,

<P>and tender associations, when her own fair self was

<P>before him, leaning on her brother's arm, and he found

<P>himself receiving a welcome, unquestionably friendly,

<P>from the woman whom, two moments before, he had been

<P>thinking of as seventy miles off, and as farther,

<P>much farther, from him in inclination than any distance

<P>could express.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Her reception of him was of a sort which he could not

<P>have hoped for, had he expected to see her.&nbsp; Coming as he

<P>did from such a purport fulfilled as had taken him away,

<P>he would have expected anything rather than a look

<P>of satisfaction, and words of simple, pleasant meaning.

<P>It was enough to set his heart in a glow, and to bring him

<P>home in the properest state for feeling the full value

<P>of the other joyful surprises at hand.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>William's promotion, with all its particulars, he was soon

<P>master of; and with such a secret provision of comfort

<P>within his own breast to help the joy, he found in it

<P>a source of most gratifying sensation and unvarying

<P>cheerfulness all dinner-time.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After dinner, when he and his father were alone,

<P>he had Fanny's history; and then all the great events

<P>of the last fortnight, and the present situation

<P>of matters at Mansfield were known to him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny suspected what was going on.&nbsp; They sat so much

<P>longer than usual in the dining-parlour, that she was sure

<P>they must be talking of her; and when tea at last brought

<P>them away, and she was to be seen by Edmund again, she felt

<P>dreadfully guilty.&nbsp; He came to her, sat down by her,

<P>took her hand, and pressed it kindly; and at that moment

<P>she thought that, but for the occupation and the scene

<P>which the tea-things afforded, she must have betrayed

<P>her emotion in some unpardonable excess.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He was not intending, however, by such action,

<P>to be conveying to her that unqualified approbation

<P>and encouragement which her hopes drew from it.

<P>It was designed only to express his participation in all

<P>that interested her, and to tell her that he had been

<P>hearing what quickened every feeling of affection.&nbsp; He was,

<P>in fact, entirely on his father's side of the question.

<P>His surprise was not so great as his father's at her

<P>refusing Crawford, because, so far from supposing

<P>her to consider him with anything like a preference,

<P>he had always believed it to be rather the reverse,

<P>and could imagine her to be taken perfectly unprepared,

<P>but Sir Thomas could not regard the connexion as more

<P>desirable than he did.&nbsp; It had every recommendation to him;

<P>and while honouring her for what she had done under the

<P>influence of her present indifference, honouring her in

<P>rather stronger terms than Sir Thomas could quite echo,

<P>he was most earnest in hoping, and sanguine in believing,

<P>that it would be a match at last, and that, united by

<P>mutual affection, it would appear that their dispositions

<P>were as exactly fitted to make them blessed in each other,

<P>as he was now beginning seriously to consider them.

<P>Crawford had been too precipitate.&nbsp; He had not given her

<P>time to attach herself.&nbsp; He had begun at the wrong end.

<P>With such powers as his, however, and such a disposition

<P>as hers, Edmund trusted that everything would work

<P>out a happy conclusion.&nbsp; Meanwhile, he saw enough

<P>of Fanny's embarrassment to make him scrupulously guard

<P>against exciting it a second time, by any word, or look,

<P>or movement.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Crawford called the next day, and on the score of Edmund's

<P>return, Sir Thomas felt himself more than licensed to ask

<P>him to stay dinner; it was really a necessary compliment.

<P>He staid of course, and Edmund had then ample opportunity

<P>for observing how he sped with Fanny, and what degree

<P>of immediate encouragement for him might be extracted from

<P>her manners; and it was so little, so very, very little--

<P>every chance, every possibility of it, resting upon her

<P>embarrassment only; if there was not hope in her confusion,

<P>there was hope in nothing else--that he was almost ready

<P>to wonder at his friend's perseverance.&nbsp; Fanny was worth

<P>it all; he held her to be worth every effort of patience,

<P>every exertion of mind, but he did not think he could have

<P>gone on himself with any woman breathing, without something

<P>more to warm his courage than his eyes could discern in hers.

<P>He was very willing to hope that Crawford saw clearer,

<P>and this was the most comfortable conclusion for his

<P>friend that he could come to from all that he observed

<P>to pass before, and at, and after dinner.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In the evening a few circumstances occurred which he thought

<P>more promising.&nbsp; When he and Crawford walked into the

<P>drawing-room, his mother and Fanny were sitting as intently

<P>and silently at work as if there were nothing else to care for.

<P>Edmund could not help noticing their apparently deep tranquillity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We have not been so silent all the time," replied his mother.

<P>"Fanny has been reading to me, and only put the book

<P>down upon hearing you coming."&nbsp; And sure enough there

<P>was a book on the table which had the air of being

<P>very recently closed:&nbsp; a volume of Shakespeare.

<P>"She often reads to me out of those books; and she

<P>was in the middle of a very fine speech of that man's--

<P>what's his name, Fanny?--when we heard your footsteps."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Crawford took the volume.&nbsp; "Let me have the pleasure

<P>of finishing that speech to your ladyship," said he.

<P>"I shall find it immediately."&nbsp; And by carefully giving

<P>way to the inclination of the leaves, he did find it,

<P>or within a page or two, quite near enough to satisfy

<P>Lady Bertram, who assured him, as soon as he mentioned the

<P>name of Cardinal Wolsey, that he had got the very speech.

<P>Not a look or an offer of help had Fanny given; not a syllable

<P>for or against.&nbsp; All her attention was for her work.

<P>She seemed determined to be interested by nothing else.

<P>But taste was too strong in her.&nbsp; She could not abstract

<P>her mind five minutes:&nbsp; she was forced to listen; his reading

<P>was capital, and her pleasure in good reading extreme.

<P>To _good_ reading, however, she had been long used:

<P>her uncle read well, her cousins all, Edmund very well,

<P>but in Mr. Crawford's reading there was a variety of

<P>excellence beyond what she had ever met with.&nbsp; The King,

<P>the Queen, Buckingham, Wolsey, Cromwell, all were given

<P>in turn; for with the happiest knack, the happiest

<P>power of jumping and guessing, he could always alight

<P>at will on the best scene, or the best speeches of each;

<P>and whether it were dignity, or pride, or tenderness,

<P>or remorse, or whatever were to be expressed, he could

<P>do it with equal beauty.&nbsp; It was truly dramatic.

<P>His acting had first taught Fanny what pleasure a play

<P>might give, and his reading brought all his acting before

<P>her again; nay, perhaps with greater enjoyment, for it

<P>came unexpectedly, and with no such drawback as she had

<P>been used to suffer in seeing him on the stage with Miss

<P>Bertram.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Edmund watched the progress of her attention, and was

<P>amused and gratified by seeing how she gradually slackened

<P>in the needlework, which at the beginning seemed to

<P>occupy her totally:&nbsp; how it fell from her hand while

<P>she sat motionless over it, and at last, how the eyes

<P>which had appeared so studiously to avoid him throughout

<P>the day were turned and fixed on Crawford--fixed on him

<P>for minutes, fixed on him, in short, till the attraction

<P>drew Crawford's upon her, and the book was closed,

<P>and the charm was broken.&nbsp; Then she was shrinking again

<P>into herself, and blushing and working as hard as ever;

<P>but it had been enough to give Edmund encouragement

<P>for his friend, and as he cordially thanked him,

<P>he hoped to be expressing Fanny's secret feelings too.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That play must be a favourite with you," said he;

<P>"you read as if you knew it well."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It will be a favourite, I believe, from this hour,"

<P>replied Crawford; "but I do not think I have had a volume

<P>of Shakespeare in my hand before since I was fifteen.

<P>I once saw Henry the Eighth acted, or I have heard

<P>of it from somebody who did, I am not certain which.

<P>But Shakespeare one gets acquainted with without knowing how.

<P>It is a part of an Englishman's constitution.&nbsp; His thoughts

<P>and beauties are so spread abroad that one touches

<P>them everywhere; one is intimate with him by instinct.

<P>No man of any brain can open at a good part of one

<P>of his plays without falling into the flow of his

<P>meaning immediately."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No doubt one is familiar with Shakespeare in a degree,"

<P>said Edmund, "from one's earliest years.&nbsp; His celebrated

<P>passages are quoted by everybody; they are in half

<P>the books we open, and we all talk Shakespeare,

<P>use his similes, and describe with his descriptions;

<P>but this is totally distinct from giving his sense as you

<P>gave it.&nbsp; To know him in bits and scraps is common enough;

<P>to know him pretty thoroughly is, perhaps, not uncommon;

<P>but to read him well aloud is no everyday talent."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Sir, you do me honour," was Crawford's answer, with a bow

<P>of mock gravity.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Both gentlemen had a glance at Fanny, to see if a word

<P>of accordant praise could be extorted from her; yet both

<P>feeling that it could not be.&nbsp; Her praise had been given

<P>in her attention; _that_ must content them.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Lady Bertram's admiration was expressed, and strongly too.

<P>"It was really like being at a play," said she.&nbsp; "I wish

<P>Sir Thomas had been here."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Crawford was excessively pleased.&nbsp; If Lady Bertram,

<P>with all her incompetency and languor, could feel this,

<P>the inference of what her niece, alive and enlightened

<P>as she was, must feel, was elevating.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You have a great turn for acting, I am sure, Mr. Crawford,"

<P>said her ladyship soon afterwards; "and I will tell you what,

<P>I think you will have a theatre, some time or other,

<P>at your house in Norfolk.&nbsp; I mean when you are settled there.

<P>I do indeed.&nbsp; I think you will fit up a theatre at your

<P>house in Norfolk."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do you, ma'am?" cried he, with quickness.&nbsp; "No, no,

<P>that will never be.&nbsp; Your ladyship is quite mistaken.

<P>No theatre at Everingham!&nbsp; Oh no!"&nbsp; And he looked at Fanny

<P>with an expressive smile, which evidently meant, "That lady

<P>will never allow a theatre at Everingham."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Edmund saw it all, and saw Fanny so determined _not_ to see it,

<P>as to make it clear that the voice was enough to convey

<P>the full meaning of the protestation; and such a quick

<P>consciousness of compliment, such a ready comprehension

<P>of a hint, he thought, was rather favourable than not.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The subject of reading aloud was farther discussed.

<P>The two young men were the only talkers, but they,

<P>standing by the fire, talked over the too common neglect

<P>of the qualification, the total inattention to it, in the

<P>ordinary school-system for boys, the consequently natural,

<P>yet in some instances almost unnatural, degree of ignorance

<P>and uncouthness of men, of sensible and well-informed men,

<P>when suddenly called to the necessity of reading aloud,

<P>which had fallen within their notice, giving instances

<P>of blunders, and failures with their secondary causes,

<P>the want of management of the voice, of proper modulation

<P>and emphasis, of foresight and judgment, all proceeding

<P>from the first cause:&nbsp; want of early attention and habit;

<P>and Fanny was listening again with great entertainment.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Even in my profession," said Edmund, with a smile,

<P>"how little the art of reading has been studied! how little

<P>a clear manner, and good delivery, have been attended to!

<P>I speak rather of the past, however, than the present.

<P>There is now a spirit of improvement abroad; but among

<P>those who were ordained twenty, thirty, forty years ago,

<P>the larger number, to judge by their performance,

<P>must have thought reading was reading, and preaching

<P>was preaching.&nbsp; It is different now.&nbsp; The subject is more

<P>justly considered.&nbsp; It is felt that distinctness and energy

<P>may have weight in recommending the most solid truths;

<P>and besides, there is more general observation and taste,

<P>a more critical knowledge diffused than formerly;

<P>in every congregation there is a larger proportion

<P>who know a little of the matter, and who can judge

<P>and criticise."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Edmund had already gone through the service once since

<P>his ordination; and upon this being understood, he had

<P>a variety of questions from Crawford as to his feelings

<P>and success; questions, which being made, though with the

<P>vivacity of friendly interest and quick taste, without any

<P>touch of that spirit of banter or air of levity which Edmund

<P>knew to be most offensive to Fanny, he had true pleasure

<P>in satisfying; and when Crawford proceeded to ask his

<P>opinion and give his own as to the properest manner in which

<P>particular passages in the service should be delivered,

<P>shewing it to be a subject on which he had thought before,

<P>and thought with judgment, Edmund was still more and

<P>more pleased.&nbsp; This would be the way to Fanny's heart.

<P>She was not to be won by all that gallantry and wit and

<P>good-nature together could do; or, at least, she would

<P>not be won by them nearly so soon, without the assistance

<P>of sentiment and feeling, and seriousness on serious subjects
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Our liturgy," observed Crawford, "has beauties, which not

<P>even a careless, slovenly style of reading can destroy;

<P>but it has also redundancies and repetitions which require

<P>good reading not to be felt.&nbsp; For myself, at least, I must

<P>confess being not always so attentive as I ought to be"

<P>(here was a glance at Fanny); "that nineteen times out of

<P>twenty I am thinking how such a prayer ought to be read,

<P>and longing to have it to read myself.&nbsp; Did you speak?"

<P>stepping eagerly to Fanny, and addressing her in a

<P>softened voice; and upon her saying "No," he added,

<P>"Are you sure you did not speak?&nbsp; I saw your lips move.

<P>I fancied you might be going to tell me I ought to be

<P>more attentive, and not _allow_ my thoughts to wander.

<P>Are not you going to tell me so?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, indeed, you know your duty too well for me to--

<P>even supposing--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She stopt, felt herself getting into a puzzle, and could

<P>not be prevailed on to add another word, not by dint

<P>of several minutes of supplication and waiting.&nbsp; He then

<P>returned to his former station, and went on as if there

<P>had been no such tender interruption.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A sermon, well delivered, is more uncommon even than prayers

<P>well read.&nbsp; A sermon, good in itself, is no rare thing.

<P>It is more difficult to speak well than to compose well;

<P>that is, the rules and trick of composition are

<P>oftener an object of study.&nbsp; A thoroughly good sermon,

<P>thoroughly well delivered, is a capital gratification.

<P>I can never hear such a one without the greatest admiration

<P>and respect, and more than half a mind to take orders

<P>and preach myself.&nbsp; There is something in the eloquence

<P>of the pulpit, when it is really eloquence, which is entitled

<P>to the highest praise and honour.&nbsp; The preacher who can

<P>touch and affect such an heterogeneous mass of hearers,

<P>on subjects limited, and long worn threadbare in all

<P>common hands; who can say anything new or striking,

<P>anything that rouses the attention without offending the taste,

<P>or wearing out the feelings of his hearers, is a man whom

<P>one could not, in his public capacity, honour enough.

<P>I should like to be such a man."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Edmund laughed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I should indeed.&nbsp; I never listened to a distinguished

<P>preacher in my life without a sort of envy.&nbsp; But then,

<P>I must have a London audience.&nbsp; I could not preach but

<P>to the educated; to those who were capable of estimating

<P>my composition.&nbsp; And I do not know that I should be fond

<P>of preaching often; now and then, perhaps once or twice

<P>in the spring, after being anxiously expected for half

<P>a dozen Sundays together; but not for a constancy;

<P>it would not do for a constancy."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Here Fanny, who could not but listen, involuntarily shook

<P>her head, and Crawford was instantly by her side again,

<P>entreating to know her meaning; and as Edmund perceived,

<P>by his drawing in a chair, and sitting down close by her,

<P>that it was to be a very thorough attack, that looks

<P>and undertones were to be well tried, he sank as quietly

<P>as possible into a corner, turned his back, and took up

<P>a newspaper, very sincerely wishing that dear little

<P>Fanny might be persuaded into explaining away that shake

<P>of the head to the satisfaction of her ardent lover;

<P>and as earnestly trying to bury every sound of the business

<P>from himself in murmurs of his own, over the various

<P>advertisements of "A most desirable Estate in South

<P>Wales"; "To Parents and Guardians"; and a "Capital

<P>season'd Hunter."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny, meanwhile, vexed with herself for not having been

<P>as motionless as she was speechless, and grieved to the heart

<P>to see Edmund's arrangements, was trying by everything

<P>in the power of her modest, gentle nature, to repulse

<P>Mr. Crawford, and avoid both his looks and inquiries;

<P>and he, unrepulsable, was persisting in both.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"What did that shake of the head mean?" said he.&nbsp; "What was

<P>it meant to express?&nbsp; Disapprobation, I fear.&nbsp; But of what?

<P>What had I been saying to displease you?&nbsp; Did you think me

<P>speaking improperly, lightly, irreverently on the subject?

<P>Only tell me if I was.&nbsp; Only tell me if I was wrong.

<P>I want to be set right.&nbsp; Nay, nay, I entreat you;

<P>for one moment put down your work.&nbsp; What did that shake

<P>of the head mean?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In vain was her "Pray, sir, don't; pray, Mr. Crawford,"

<P>repeated twice over; and in vain did she try to move away.

<P>In the same low, eager voice, and the same close neighbourhood,

<P>he went on, reurging the same questions as before.

<P>She grew more agitated and displeased.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How can you, sir?&nbsp; You quite astonish me; I wonder

<P>how you can--"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do I astonish you?" said he.&nbsp; "Do you wonder?&nbsp; Is there

<P>anything in my present entreaty that you do not understand?

<P>I will explain to you instantly all that makes me urge

<P>you in this manner, all that gives me an interest in

<P>what you look and do, and excites my present curiosity.

<P>I will not leave you to wonder long."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In spite of herself, she could not help half a smile,

<P>but she said nothing.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You shook your head at my acknowledging that I should

<P>not like to engage in the duties of a clergyman always

<P>for a constancy.&nbsp; Yes, that was the word.&nbsp; Constancy:&nbsp;
I am

<P>not afraid of the word.&nbsp; I would spell it, read it,

<P>write it with anybody.&nbsp; I see nothing alarming in the word.

<P>Did you think I ought?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Perhaps, sir," said Fanny, wearied at last into speaking--

<P>"perhaps, sir, I thought it was a pity you did not always

<P>know yourself as well as you seemed to do at that moment."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Crawford, delighted to get her to speak at any rate,

<P>was determined to keep it up; and poor Fanny, who had

<P>hoped to silence him by such an extremity of reproof,

<P>found herself sadly mistaken, and that it was only a change

<P>from one object of curiosity and one set of words to another.

<P>He had always something to entreat the explanation of.

<P>The opportunity was too fair.&nbsp; None such had occurred

<P>since his seeing her in her uncle's room, none such might

<P>occur again before his leaving Mansfield.&nbsp; Lady Bertram's

<P>being just on the other side of the table was a trifle,

<P>for she might always be considered as only half-awake, and

<P>Edmund's advertisements were still of the first utility.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Well," said Crawford, after a course of rapid questions

<P>and reluctant answers; "I am happier than I was, because I

<P>now understand more clearly your opinion of me.&nbsp; You think

<P>me unsteady:&nbsp; easily swayed by the whim of the moment,

<P>easily tempted, easily put aside.&nbsp; With such an opinion,

<P>no wonder that.&nbsp; But we shall see.&nbsp; It is not by protestations

<P>that I shall endeavour to convince you I am wronged;

<P>it is not by telling you that my affections are steady.

<P>My conduct shall speak for me; absence, distance, time shall

<P>speak for me.&nbsp; _They_ shall prove that, as far as you

<P>can be deserved by anybody, I do deserve you.&nbsp; You are

<P>infinitely my superior in merit; all _that_ I know.

<P>You have qualities which I had not before supposed

<P>to exist in such a degree in any human creature.

<P>You have some touches of the angel in you beyond what--

<P>not merely beyond what one sees, because one never sees

<P>anything like it--but beyond what one fancies might be.

<P>But still I am not frightened.&nbsp; It is not by equality of

<P>merit that you can be won.&nbsp; That is out of the question.

<P>It is he who sees and worships your merit the strongest,

<P>who loves you most devotedly, that has the best

<P>right to a return.&nbsp; There I build my confidence.

<P>By that right I do and will deserve you; and when once

<P>convinced that my attachment is what I declare it,

<P>I know you too well not to entertain the warmest hopes.

<P>Yes, dearest, sweetest Fanny.&nbsp; Nay" (seeing her draw back

<P>displeased), "forgive me.&nbsp; Perhaps I have as yet no right;

<P>but by what other name can I call you?&nbsp; Do you suppose

<P>you are ever present to my imagination under any other?

<P>No, it is 'Fanny' that I think of all day, and dream

<P>of all night.&nbsp; You have given the name such reality

<P>of sweetness, that nothing else can now be descriptive

<P>of you."

<P>Fanny could hardly have kept her seat any longer,

<P>or have refrained from at least trying to get away in

<P>spite of all the too public opposition she foresaw to it,

<P>had it not been for the sound of approaching relief,

<P>the very sound which she had been long watching for,

<P>and long thinking strangely delayed.

<P>The solemn procession, headed by Baddeley, of tea-board, urn,

<P>and cake-bearers, made its appearance, and delivered

<P>her from a grievous imprisonment of body and mind.

<P>Mr. Crawford was obliged to move.&nbsp; She was at liberty,

<P>she was busy, she was protected.

<P>Edmund was not sorry to be admitted again among the

<P>number of those who might speak and hear.&nbsp; But though

<P>the conference had seemed full long to him, and though

<P>on looking at Fanny he saw rather a flush of vexation,

<P>he inclined to hope that so much could not have been

<P>said and listened to without some profit to the speaker.
