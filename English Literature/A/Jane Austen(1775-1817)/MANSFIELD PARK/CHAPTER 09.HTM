<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Rushworth was at the door to receive his fair lady;

<P>and the whole party were welcomed by him with due attention.

<P>In the drawing-room they were met with equal cordiality

<P>by the mother, and Miss Bertram had all the distinction

<P>with each that she could wish.&nbsp; After the business

<P>of arriving was over, it was first necessary to eat,

<P>and the doors were thrown open to admit them through one

<P>or two intermediate rooms into the appointed dining-parlour,

<P>where a collation was prepared with abundance and elegance.

<P>Much was said, and much was ate, and all went well.

<P>The particular object of the day was then considered.

<P>How would Mr. Crawford like, in what manner would he chuse,

<P>to take a survey of the grounds?&nbsp; Mr. Rushworth mentioned

<P>his curricle.&nbsp; Mr. Crawford suggested the greater desirableness

<P>of some carriage which might convey more than two.

<P>"To be depriving themselves of the advantage of other eyes

<P>and other judgments, might be an evil even beyond the loss

<P>of present pleasure."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Rushworth proposed that the chaise should be taken also;

<P>but this was scarcely received as an amendment:&nbsp; the young

<P>ladies neither smiled nor spoke.&nbsp; Her next proposition,

<P>of shewing the house to such of them as had not been

<P>there before, was more acceptable, for Miss Bertram was

<P>pleased to have its size displayed, and all were glad

<P>to be doing something.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The whole party rose accordingly, and under Mrs. Rushworth's

<P>guidance were shewn through a number of rooms, all lofty,

<P>and many large, and amply furnished in the taste of fifty

<P>years back, with shining floors, solid mahogany, rich damask,

<P>marble, gilding, and carving, each handsome in its way.

<P>Of pictures there were abundance, and some few good,

<P>but the larger part were family portraits, no longer

<P>anything to anybody but Mrs. Rushworth, who had been at

<P>great pains to learn all that the housekeeper could teach,

<P>and was now almost equally well qualified to shew the house.

<P>On the present occasion she addressed herself chiefly

<P>to Miss Crawford and Fanny, but there was no comparison

<P>in the willingness of their attention; for Miss Crawford,

<P>who had seen scores of great houses, and cared for none

<P>of them, had only the appearance of civilly listening,

<P>while Fanny, to whom everything was almost as interesting

<P>as it was new, attended with unaffected earnestness to all

<P>that Mrs. Rushworth could relate of the family in former times,

<P>its rise and grandeur, regal visits and loyal efforts,

<P>delighted to connect anything with history already known,

<P>or warm her imagination with scenes of the past.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The situation of the house excluded the possibility

<P>of much prospect from any of the rooms; and while Fanny

<P>and some of the others were attending Mrs. Rushworth,

<P>Henry Crawford was looking grave and shaking his head

<P>at the windows.&nbsp; Every room on the west front looked

<P>across a lawn to the beginning of the avenue immediately

<P>beyond tall iron palisades and gates.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Having visited many more rooms than could be supposed to be

<P>of any other use than to contribute to the window-tax, and

<P>find employment for housemaids, "Now," said Mrs. Rushworth,

<P>"we are coming to the chapel, which properly we ought

<P>to enter from above, and look down upon; but as we

<P>are quite among friends, I will take you in this way,

<P>if you will excuse me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>They entered.&nbsp; Fanny's imagination had prepared her

<P>for something grander than a mere spacious, oblong room,

<P>fitted up for the purpose of devotion:&nbsp; with nothing more

<P>striking or more solemn than the profusion of mahogany,

<P>and the crimson velvet cushions appearing over the ledge

<P>of the family gallery above.&nbsp; "I am disappointed,"

<P>said she, in a low voice, to Edmund.&nbsp; "This is not

<P>my idea of a chapel.&nbsp; There is nothing awful here,

<P>nothing melancholy, nothing grand.&nbsp; Here are no aisles,

<P>no arches, no inscriptions, no banners.&nbsp; No banners,

<P>cousin, to be 'blown by the night wind of heaven.'

<P>No signs that a 'Scottish monarch sleeps below.'"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You forget, Fanny, how lately all this has been built,

<P>and for how confined a purpose, compared with the old

<P>chapels of castles and monasteries.&nbsp; It was only for

<P>the private use of the family.&nbsp; They have been buried,

<P>I suppose, in the parish church.&nbsp; _There_ you must look

<P>for the banners and the achievements."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It was foolish of me not to think of all that; but I

<P>am disappointed."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Rushworth began her relation.&nbsp; "This chapel was fitted up

<P>as you see it, in James the Second's time.&nbsp; Before that period,

<P>as I understand, the pews were only wainscot; and there

<P>is some reason to think that the linings and cushions

<P>of the pulpit and family seat were only purple cloth;

<P>but this is not quite certain.&nbsp; It is a handsome chapel,

<P>and was formerly in constant use both morning and evening.

<P>Prayers were always read in it by the domestic chaplain,

<P>within the memory of many; but the late Mr. Rushworth left

<P>it off."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Every generation has its improvements," said Miss Crawford,

<P>with a smile, to Edmund.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Rushworth was gone to repeat her lesson to Mr. Crawford;

<P>and Edmund, Fanny, and Miss Crawford remained in a cluster

<P>together.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is a pity," cried Fanny, "that the custom should have

<P>been discontinued.&nbsp; It was a valuable part of former times.

<P>There is something in a chapel and chaplain so much

<P>in character with a great house, with one's ideas of what

<P>such a household should be!&nbsp; A whole family assembling

<P>regularly for the purpose of prayer is fine!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very fine indeed," said Miss Crawford, laughing.&nbsp; "It must

<P>do the heads of the family a great deal of good to force

<P>all the poor housemaids and footmen to leave business

<P>and pleasure, and say their prayers here twice a day,

<P>while they are inventing excuses themselves for staying

<P>away."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"_That_ is hardly Fanny's idea of a family assembling,"

<P>said Edmund.&nbsp; "If the master and mistress do _not_

<P>attend themselves, there must be more harm than good

<P>in the custom."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"At any rate, it is safer to leave people to their own

<P>devices on such subjects.&nbsp; Everybody likes to go their

<P>own way--to chuse their own time and manner of devotion.

<P>The obligation of attendance, the formality, the restraint,

<P>the length of time--altogether it is a formidable thing,

<P>and what nobody likes; and if the good people who used

<P>to kneel and gape in that gallery could have foreseen

<P>that the time would ever come when men and women might lie

<P>another ten minutes in bed, when they woke with a headache,

<P>without danger of reprobation, because chapel was missed,

<P>they would have jumped with joy and envy.&nbsp; Cannot you

<P>imagine with what unwilling feelings the former belles

<P>of the house of Rushworth did many a time repair to

<P>this chapel?&nbsp; The young Mrs. Eleanors and Mrs. Bridgets--

<P>starched up into seeming piety, but with heads full

<P>of something very different--especially if the poor

<P>chaplain were not worth looking at--and, in those days,

<P>I fancy parsons were very inferior even to what they

<P>are now."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For a few moments she was unanswered.&nbsp; Fanny coloured

<P>and looked at Edmund, but felt too angry for speech;

<P>and he needed a little recollection before he could say,

<P>"Your lively mind can hardly be serious even on serious subjects.

<P>You have given us an amusing sketch, and human nature

<P>cannot say it was not so.&nbsp; We must all feel _at_ _times_

<P>the difficulty of fixing our thoughts as we could wish;

<P>but if you are supposing it a frequent thing, that is to say,

<P>a weakness grown into a habit from neglect, what could

<P>be expected from the _private_ devotions of such persons?

<P>Do you think the minds which are suffered, which are

<P>indulged in wanderings in a chapel, would be more collected

<P>in a closet?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, very likely.&nbsp; They would have two chances at least

<P>in their favour.&nbsp; There would be less to distract the

<P>attention from without, and it would not be tried so long."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The mind which does not struggle against itself under

<P>_one_ circumstance, would find objects to distract it

<P>in the _other_, I believe; and the influence of the place

<P>and of example may often rouse better feelings than are

<P>begun with.&nbsp; The greater length of the service, however,

<P>I admit to be sometimes too hard a stretch upon the mind.

<P>One wishes it were not so; but I have not yet left

<P>Oxford long enough to forget what chapel prayers are."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>While this was passing, the rest of the party being scattered

<P>about the chapel, Julia called Mr. Crawford's attention to

<P>her sister, by saying, "Do look at Mr. Rushworth and Maria,

<P>standing side by side, exactly as if the ceremony were

<P>going to be performed.&nbsp; Have not they completely the air of it?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mr. Crawford smiled his acquiescence, and stepping forward

<P>to Maria, said, in a voice which she only could hear,

<P>"I do not like to see Miss Bertram so near the altar."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Starting, the lady instinctively moved a step or two,

<P>but recovering herself in a moment, affected to laugh,

<P>and asked him, in a tone not much louder, "If he would give

<P>her away?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am afraid I should do it very awkwardly," was his reply,

<P>with a look of meaning.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Julia, joining them at the moment, carried on the joke.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Upon my word, it is really a pity that it should not

<P>take place directly, if we had but a proper licence,

<P>for here we are altogether, and nothing in the world

<P>could be more snug and pleasant."&nbsp; And she talked and

<P>laughed about it with so little caution as to catch the

<P>comprehension of Mr. Rushworth and his mother, and expose

<P>her sister to the whispered gallantries of her lover,

<P>while Mrs. Rushworth spoke with proper smiles and dignity

<P>of its being a most happy event to her whenever it took place.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If Edmund were but in orders!" cried Julia, and running

<P>to where he stood with Miss Crawford and Fanny:

<P>"My dear Edmund, if you were but in orders now, you might

<P>perform the ceremony directly.&nbsp; How unlucky that you

<P>are not ordained; Mr. Rushworth and Maria are quite ready."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Miss Crawford's countenance, as Julia spoke, might have

<P>amused a disinterested observer.&nbsp; She looked almost aghast

<P>under the new idea she was receiving.&nbsp; Fanny pitied her.

<P>"How distressed she will be at what she said just now,"

<P>passed across her mind.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Ordained!" said Miss Crawford; "what, are you to be

<P>a clergyman?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes; I shall take orders soon after my father's return--

<P>probably at Christmas."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Miss Crawford, rallying her spirits, and recovering

<P>her complexion, replied only, "If I had known this before,

<P>I would have spoken of the cloth with more respect,"

<P>and turned the subject.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The chapel was soon afterwards left to the silence and stillness

<P>which reigned in it, with few interruptions, throughout the year.

<P>Miss Bertram, displeased with her sister, led the way,

<P>and all seemed to feel that they had been there long enough.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The lower part of the house had been now entirely shewn,

<P>and Mrs. Rushworth, never weary in the cause, would have

<P>proceeded towards the principal staircase, and taken

<P>them through all the rooms above, if her son had not

<P>interposed with a doubt of there being time enough.

<P>"For if," said he, with the sort of self-evident proposition

<P>which many a clearer head does not always avoid, "we are

<P>_too_ long going over the house, we shall not have time

<P>for what is to be done out of doors.&nbsp; It is past two,

<P>and we are to dine at five."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Mrs. Rushworth submitted; and the question of surveying

<P>the grounds, with the who and the how, was likely to be more

<P>fully agitated, and Mrs. Norris was beginning to arrange

<P>by what junction of carriages and horses most could be done,

<P>when the young people, meeting with an outward door,

<P>temptingly open on a flight of steps which led immediately

<P>to turf and shrubs, and all the sweets of pleasure-grounds,

<P>as by one impulse, one wish for air and liberty, all walked out.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Suppose we turn down here for the present," said Mrs. Rushworth,

<P>civilly taking the hint and following them.&nbsp; "Here are the

<P>greatest number of our plants, and here are the curious pheasants."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Query," said Mr. Crawford, looking round him,

<P>"whether we may not find something to employ us here

<P>before we go farther?&nbsp; I see walls of great promise.

<P>Mr. Rushworth, shall we summon a council on this lawn?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"James," said Mrs. Rushworth to her son, "I believe

<P>the wilderness will be new to all the party.&nbsp; The Miss

<P>Bertrams have never seen the wilderness yet."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>No objection was made, but for some time there seemed

<P>no inclination to move in any plan, or to any distance.

<P>All were attracted at first by the plants or the pheasants,

<P>and all dispersed about in happy independence.

<P>Mr. Crawford was the first to move forward to examine

<P>the capabilities of that end of the house.&nbsp; The lawn,

<P>bounded on each side by a high wall, contained beyond

<P>the first planted area a bowling-green, and beyond

<P>the bowling-green a long terrace walk, backed by iron

<P>palisades, and commanding a view over them into the tops

<P>of the trees of the wilderness immediately adjoining.

<P>It was a good spot for fault-finding. Mr. Crawford was soon

<P>followed by Miss Bertram and Mr. Rushworth; and when,

<P>after a little time, the others began to form into parties,

<P>these three were found in busy consultation on the terrace

<P>by Edmund, Miss Crawford, and Fanny, who seemed as naturally

<P>to unite, and who, after a short participation of their

<P>regrets and difficulties, left them and walked on.

<P>The remaining three, Mrs. Rushworth, Mrs. Norris,

<P>and Julia, were still far behind; for Julia, whose happy

<P>star no longer prevailed, was obliged to keep by the side

<P>of Mrs. Rushworth, and restrain her impatient feet to that

<P>lady's slow pace, while her aunt, having fallen in with

<P>the housekeeper, who was come out to feed the pheasants,

<P>was lingering behind in gossip with her.&nbsp; Poor Julia,

<P>the only one out of the nine not tolerably satisfied

<P>with their lot, was now in a state of complete penance,

<P>and as different from the Julia of the barouche-box

<P>as could well be imagined.&nbsp; The politeness which she had

<P>been brought up to practise as a duty made it impossible

<P>for her to escape; while the want of that higher species

<P>of self-command, that just consideration of others,

<P>that knowledge of her own heart, that principle of right,

<P>which had not formed any essential part of her education,

<P>made her miserable under it.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"This is insufferably hot," said Miss Crawford, when they

<P>had taken one turn on the terrace, and were drawing

<P>a second time to the door in the middle which opened to

<P>the wilderness.&nbsp; "Shall any of us object to being comfortable?

<P>Here is a nice little wood, if one can but get into it.

<P>What happiness if the door should not be locked! but of

<P>course it is; for in these great places the gardeners

<P>are the only people who can go where they like."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The door, however, proved not to be locked, and they were

<P>all agreed in turning joyfully through it, and leaving

<P>the unmitigated glare of day behind.&nbsp; A considerable

<P>flight of steps landed them in the wilderness, which was

<P>a planted wood of about two acres, and though chiefly

<P>of larch and laurel, and beech cut down, and though laid

<P>out with too much regularity, was darkness and shade,

<P>and natural beauty, compared with the bowling-green

<P>and the terrace.&nbsp; They all felt the refreshment of it,

<P>and for some time could only walk and admire.&nbsp; At length,

<P>after a short pause, Miss Crawford began with, "So you

<P>are to be a clergyman, Mr. Bertram.&nbsp; This is rather

<P>a surprise to me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Why should it surprise you?&nbsp; You must suppose me designed

<P>for some profession, and might perceive that I am neither

<P>a lawyer, nor a soldier, nor a sailor."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Very true; but, in short, it had not occurred to me.

<P>And you know there is generally an uncle or a grandfather

<P>to leave a fortune to the second son."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"A very praiseworthy practice," said Edmund,

<P>"but not quite universal.&nbsp; I am one of the exceptions,

<P>and _being_ one, must do something for myself."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"'But why are you to be a clergyman?&nbsp; I thought _that_

<P>was always the lot of the youngest, where there were

<P>many to chuse before him."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Do you think the church itself never chosen, then?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"_Never_ is a black word.&nbsp; But yes, in the _never_

<P>of conversation, which means _not_ _very_ _often_,

<P>I do think it.&nbsp; For what is to be done in the church?

<P>Men love to distinguish themselves, and in either of the other

<P>lines distinction may be gained, but not in the church.

<P>A clergyman is nothing."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The _nothing_ of conversation has its gradations, I hope,

<P>as well as the _never_.&nbsp; A clergyman cannot be high in

<P>state or fashion.&nbsp; He must not head mobs, or set the ton

<P>in dress.&nbsp; But I cannot call that situation nothing which

<P>has the charge of all that is of the first importance

<P>to mankind, individually or collectively considered,

<P>temporally and eternally, which has the guardianship

<P>of religion and morals, and consequently of the manners

<P>which result from their influence.&nbsp; No one here can call

<P>the _office_ nothing.&nbsp; If the man who holds it is so,

<P>it is by the neglect of his duty, by foregoing its

<P>just importance, and stepping out of his place to appear

<P>what he ought not to appear."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"_You_ assign greater consequence to the clergyman than one

<P>has been used to hear given, or than I can quite comprehend.

<P>One does not see much of this influence and importance

<P>in society, and how can it be acquired where they are

<P>so seldom seen themselves?&nbsp; How can two sermons a week,

<P>even supposing them worth hearing, supposing the preacher

<P>to have the sense to prefer Blair's to his own, do all

<P>that you speak of? govern the conduct and fashion the

<P>manners of a large congregation for the rest of the week?

<P>One scarcely sees a clergyman out of his pulpit."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"_You_ are speaking of London, _I_ am speaking of the

<P>nation at large."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"The metropolis, I imagine, is a pretty fair sample

<P>of the rest."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not, I should hope, of the proportion of virtue to vice

<P>throughout the kingdom.&nbsp; We do not look in great cities

<P>for our best morality.&nbsp; It is not there that respectable

<P>people of any denomination can do most good; and it

<P>certainly is not there that the influence of the clergy can

<P>be most felt.&nbsp; A fine preacher is followed and admired;

<P>but it is not in fine preaching only that a good clergyman

<P>will be useful in his parish and his neighbourhood,

<P>where the parish and neighbourhood are of a size capable

<P>of knowing his private character, and observing his

<P>general conduct, which in London can rarely be the case.

<P>The clergy are lost there in the crowds of their parishioners.

<P>They are known to the largest part only as preachers.

<P>And with regard to their influencing public manners,

<P>Miss Crawford must not misunderstand me, or suppose I mean

<P>to call them the arbiters of good-breeding, the regulators

<P>of refinement and courtesy, the masters of the ceremonies

<P>of life.&nbsp; The _manners_ I speak of might rather be

<P>called _conduct_, perhaps, the result of good principles;

<P>the effect, in short, of those doctrines which it

<P>is their duty to teach and recommend; and it will,

<P>I believe, be everywhere found, that as the clergy are,

<P>or are not what they ought to be, so are the rest of

<P>the nation."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Certainly," said Fanny, with gentle earnestness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There," cried Miss Crawford, "you have quite convinced

<P>Miss Price already."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I wish I could convince Miss Crawford too."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I do not think you ever will," said she, with an arch smile;

<P>"I am just as much surprised now as I was at first

<P>that you should intend to take orders.&nbsp; You really are

<P>fit for something better.&nbsp; Come, do change your mind.

<P>It is not too late.&nbsp; Go into the law."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Go into the law!&nbsp; With as much ease as I was told to go

<P>into this wilderness."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Now you are going to say something about law being

<P>the worst wilderness of the two, but I forestall you;

<P>remember, I have forestalled you."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"You need not hurry when the object is only to prevent

<P>my saying a _bon_ _mot_, for there is not the least wit in

<P>my nature.&nbsp; I am a very matter-of-fact, plain-spoken being,

<P>and may blunder on the borders of a repartee for half

<P>an hour together without striking it out."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A general silence succeeded.&nbsp; Each was thoughtful.

<P>Fanny made the first interruption by saying, "I wonder

<P>that I should be tired with only walking in this sweet wood;

<P>but the next time we come to a seat, if it is not disagreeable

<P>to you, I should be glad to sit down for a little while."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My dear Fanny," cried Edmund, immediately drawing her arm

<P>within his, "how thoughtless I have been!&nbsp; I hope you

<P>are not very tired.&nbsp; Perhaps," turning to Miss Crawford,

<P>"my other companion may do me the honour of taking an arm."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Thank you, but I am not at all tired."&nbsp; She took it,

<P>however, as she spoke, and the gratification of having

<P>her do so, of feeling such a connexion for the first time,

<P>made him a little forgetful of Fanny.&nbsp; "You scarcely

<P>touch me," said he.&nbsp; "You do not make me of any use.

<P>What a difference in the weight of a woman's arm from

<P>that of a man!&nbsp; At Oxford I have been a good deal used

<P>to have a man lean on me for the length of a street,

<P>and you are only a fly in the comparison."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am really not tired, which I almost wonder at;

<P>for we must have walked at least a mile in this wood.

<P>Do not you think we have?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Not half a mile," was his sturdy answer; for he was not yet

<P>so much in love as to measure distance, or reckon time,

<P>with feminine lawlessness.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! you do not consider how much we have wound about.

<P>We have taken such a very serpentine course, and the wood

<P>itself must be half a mile long in a straight line,

<P>for we have never seen the end of it yet since we left

<P>the first great path."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But if you remember, before we left that first great path,

<P>we saw directly to the end of it.&nbsp; We looked down the

<P>whole vista, and saw it closed by iron gates, and it

<P>could not have been more than a furlong in length."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh!&nbsp; I know nothing of your furlongs, but I am sure

<P>it is a very long wood, and that we have been winding

<P>in and out ever since we came into it; and therefore,

<P>when I say that we have walked a mile in it, I must speak

<P>within compass."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"We have been exactly a quarter of an hour here,"

<P>said Edmund, taking out his watch.&nbsp; "Do you think we

<P>are walking four miles an hour?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh! do not attack me with your watch.&nbsp; A watch is always

<P>too fast or too slow.&nbsp; I cannot be dictated to by a watch."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A few steps farther brought them out at the bottom of the

<P>very walk they had been talking of; and standing back,

<P>well shaded and sheltered, and looking over a ha-ha into

<P>the park, was a comfortable-sized bench, on which they

<P>all sat down.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am afraid you are very tired, Fanny," said Edmund,

<P>observing her; "why would not you speak sooner?&nbsp; This will be

<P>a bad day's amusement for you if you are to be knocked up.

<P>Every sort of exercise fatigues her so soon, Miss Crawford,

<P>except riding."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"How abominable in you, then, to let me engross her horse

<P>as I did all last week!&nbsp; I am ashamed of you and of myself,

<P>but it shall never happen again."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"_Your_ attentiveness and consideration makes me more

<P>sensible of my own neglect.&nbsp; Fanny's interest seems

<P>in safer hands with you than with me."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"That she should be tired now, however, gives me no surprise;

<P>for there is nothing in the course of one's duties

<P>so fatiguing as what we have been doing this morning:

<P>seeing a great house, dawdling from one room to another,

<P>straining one's eyes and one's attention, hearing what one

<P>does not understand, admiring what one does not care for.

<P>It is generally allowed to be the greatest bore in the world,

<P>and Miss Price has found it so, though she did not

<P>know it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I shall soon be rested," said Fanny; "to sit

<P>in the shade on a fine day, and look upon verdure,

<P>is the most perfect refreshment."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>After sitting a little while Miss Crawford was up again.

<P>"I must move," said she; "resting fatigues me.

<P>I have looked across the ha-ha till I am weary.&nbsp; I must

<P>go and look through that iron gate at the same view,

<P>without being able to see it so well."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Edmund left the seat likewise.&nbsp; "Now, Miss Crawford,

<P>if you will look up the walk, you will convince yourself

<P>that it cannot be half a mile long, or half half a mile."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is an immense distance," said she; "I see _that_

<P>with a glance."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He still reasoned with her, but in vain.&nbsp; She would

<P>not calculate, she would not compare.&nbsp; She would only

<P>smile and assert.&nbsp; The greatest degree of rational

<P>consistency could not have been more engaging, and they

<P>talked with mutual satisfaction.&nbsp; At last it was agreed

<P>that they should endeavour to determine the dimensions

<P>of the wood by walking a little more about it.&nbsp; They would

<P>go to one end of it, in the line they were then in--

<P>for there was a straight green walk along the bottom

<P>by the side of the ha-ha--and perhaps turn a little way

<P>in some other direction, if it seemed likely to assist them,

<P>and be back in a few minutes.&nbsp; Fanny said she was rested,

<P>and would have moved too, but this was not suffered.

<P>Edmund urged her remaining where she was with an

<P>earnestness which she could not resist, and she was left

<P>on the bench to think with pleasure of her cousin's care,

<P>but with great regret that she was not stronger.

<P>She watched them till they had turned the corner,

<P>and listened till all sound of them had ceased.
