<P>It was not in Miss Crawford's power to talk Fanny into any

<P>real forgetfulness of what had passed.&nbsp; When the evening

<P>was over, she went to bed full of it, her nerves still

<P>agitated by the shock of such an attack from her cousin Tom,

<P>so public and so persevered in, and her spirits sinking

<P>under her aunt's unkind reflection and reproach.

<P>To be called into notice in such a manner, to hear that it

<P>was but the prelude to something so infinitely worse,

<P>to be told that she must do what was so impossible as to act;

<P>and then to have the charge of obstinacy and ingratitude

<P>follow it, enforced with such a hint at the dependence

<P>of her situation, had been too distressing at the time

<P>to make the remembrance when she was alone much less so,

<P>especially with the superadded dread of what the

<P>morrow might produce in continuation of the subject.

<P>Miss Crawford had protected her only for the time;

<P>and if she were applied to again among themselves with all

<P>the authoritative urgency that Tom and Maria were capable of,

<P>and Edmund perhaps away, what should she do?&nbsp; She fell

<P>asleep before she could answer the question, and found

<P>it quite as puzzling when she awoke the next morning.

<P>The little white attic, which had continued her sleeping-room

<P>ever since her first entering the family, proving incompetent

<P>to suggest any reply, she had recourse, as soon as she

<P>was dressed, to another apartment more spacious and more

<P>meet for walking about in and thinking, and of which she

<P>had now for some time been almost equally mistress.

<P>It had been their school-room; so called till the Miss

<P>Bertrams would not allow it to be called so any longer,

<P>and inhabited as such to a later period.&nbsp; There Miss

<P>Lee had lived, and there they had read and written,

<P>and talked and laughed, till within the last three years,

<P>when she had quitted them.&nbsp; The room had then become useless,

<P>and for some time was quite deserted, except by Fanny,

<P>when she visited her plants, or wanted one of the books,

<P>which she was still glad to keep there, from the deficiency

<P>of space and accommodation in her little chamber above:

<P>but gradually, as her value for the comforts of it increased,

<P>she had added to her possessions, and spent more of her

<P>time there; and having nothing to oppose her, had so

<P>naturally and so artlessly worked herself into it, that it

<P>was now generally admitted to be hers.&nbsp; The East room,

<P>as it had been called ever since Maria Bertram was sixteen,

<P>was now considered Fanny's, almost as decidedly as the

<P>white attic:&nbsp; the smallness of the one making the use of

<P>the other so evidently reasonable that the Miss Bertrams,

<P>with every superiority in their own apartments which their

<P>own sense of superiority could demand, were entirely

<P>approving it; and Mrs. Norris, having stipulated for there

<P>never being a fire in it on Fanny's account, was tolerably

<P>resigned to her having the use of what nobody else wanted,

<P>though the terms in which she sometimes spoke of the

<P>indulgence seemed to imply that it was the best room in

<P>the house.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>The aspect was so favourable that even without a fire

<P>it was habitable in many an early spring and late

<P>autumn morning to such a willing mind as Fanny's;

<P>and while there was a gleam of sunshine she hoped not

<P>to be driven from it entirely, even when winter came.

<P>The comfort of it in her hours of leisure was extreme.

<P>She could go there after anything unpleasant below,

<P>and find immediate consolation in some pursuit,

<P>or some train of thought at hand.&nbsp; Her plants, her books--

<P>of which she had been a collector from the first hour

<P>of her commanding a shilling--her writing-desk, and her

<P>works of charity and ingenuity, were all within her reach;

<P>or if indisposed for employment, if nothing but musing

<P>would do, she could scarcely see an object in that room

<P>which had not an interesting remembrance connected with it.

<P>Everything was a friend, or bore her thoughts to a friend;

<P>and though there had been sometimes much of suffering

<P>to her; though her motives had often been misunderstood,

<P>her feelings disregarded, and her comprehension undervalued;

<P>though she had known the pains of tyranny, of ridicule,

<P>and neglect, yet almost every recurrence of either had led

<P>to something consolatory:&nbsp; her aunt Bertram had spoken

<P>for her, or Miss Lee had been encouraging, or, what was yet

<P>more frequent or more dear, Edmund had been her champion

<P>and her friend:&nbsp; he had supported her cause or explained

<P>her meaning, he had told her not to cry, or had given her

<P>some proof of affection which made her tears delightful;

<P>and the whole was now so blended together, so harmonised

<P>by distance, that every former affliction had its charm.

<P>The room was most dear to her, and she would not have

<P>changed its furniture for the handsomest in the house,

<P>though what had been originally plain had suffered all

<P>the ill-usage of children; and its greatest elegancies

<P>and ornaments were a faded footstool of Julia's work,

<P>too ill done for the drawing-room, three transparencies,

<P>made in a rage for transparencies, for the three lower

<P>panes of one window, where Tintern Abbey held its station

<P>between a cave in Italy and a moonlight lake in Cumberland,

<P>a collection of family profiles, thought unworthy of being

<P>anywhere else, over the mantelpiece, and by their side,

<P>and pinned against the wall, a small sketch of a ship

<P>sent four years ago from the Mediterranean by William,

<P>with H.M.S. Antwerp at the bottom, in letters as tall as the

<P>mainmast.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To this nest of comforts Fanny now walked down to try

<P>its influence on an agitated, doubting spirit, to see

<P>if by looking at Edmund's profile she could catch any of

<P>his counsel, or by giving air to her geraniums she might

<P>inhale a breeze of mental strength herself.&nbsp; But she had

<P>more than fears of her own perseverance to remove:&nbsp; she had

<P>begun to feel undecided as to what she _ought_ _to_ _do_;

<P>and as she walked round the room her doubts were increasing.

<P>Was she _right_ in refusing what was so warmly asked,

<P>so strongly wished for--what might be so essential

<P>to a scheme on which some of those to whom she owed the

<P>greatest complaisance had set their hearts?&nbsp; Was it not

<P>ill-nature, selfishness, and a fear of exposing herself?

<P>And would Edmund's judgment, would his persuasion of Sir

<P>Thomas's disapprobation of the whole, be enough to justify

<P>her in a determined denial in spite of all the rest?

<P>It would be so horrible to her to act that she was inclined

<P>to suspect the truth and purity of her own scruples;

<P>and as she looked around her, the claims of her cousins

<P>to being obliged were strengthened by the sight of

<P>present upon present that she had received from them.

<P>The table between the windows was covered with work-boxes

<P>and netting-boxes which had been given her at different times,

<P>principally by Tom; and she grew bewildered as to the amount

<P>of the debt which all these kind remembrances produced.

<P>A tap at the door roused her in the midst of this attempt

<P>to find her way to her duty, and her gentle "Come in"

<P>was answered by the appearance of one, before whom all her

<P>doubts were wont to be laid.&nbsp; Her eyes brightened at the

<P>sight of Edmund.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Can I speak with you, Fanny, for a few minutes?"

<P>said he.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, certainly."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I want to consult.&nbsp; I want your opinion."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"My opinion!" she cried, shrinking from such a compliment,

<P>highly as it gratified her.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, your advice and opinion.&nbsp; I do not know what to do.

<P>This acting scheme gets worse and worse, you see.

<P>They have chosen almost as bad a play as they could,

<P>and now, to complete the business, are going to ask the

<P>help of a young man very slightly known to any of us.

<P>This is the end of all the privacy and propriety which was

<P>talked about at first.&nbsp; I know no harm of Charles Maddox;

<P>but the excessive intimacy which must spring from his being

<P>admitted among us in this manner is highly objectionable,

<P>the _more_ than intimacy--the familiarity.&nbsp; I cannot think

<P>of it with any patience; and it does appear to me an evil

<P>of such magnitude as must, _if_ _possible_, be prevented.

<P>Do not you see it in the same light?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes; but what can be done?&nbsp; Your brother is so determined."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"There is but _one_ thing to be done, Fanny.&nbsp; I must

<P>take Anhalt myself.&nbsp; I am well aware that nothing else

<P>will quiet Tom."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Fanny could not answer him.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"It is not at all what I like," he continued.&nbsp; "No man can

<P>like being driven into the _appearance_ of such inconsistency.

<P>After being known to oppose the scheme from the beginning,

<P>there is absurdity in the face of my joining them _now_,

<P>when they are exceeding their first plan in every respect;

<P>but I can think of no other alternative.&nbsp; Can you, Fanny?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No," said Fanny slowly, "not immediately, but--
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But what?&nbsp; I see your judgment is not with me.&nbsp; Think it

<P>a little over.&nbsp; Perhaps you are not so much aware as I am

<P>of the mischief that _may_, of the unpleasantness that _must_

<P>arise from a young man's being received in this manner:

<P>domesticated among us; authorised to come at all hours,

<P>and placed suddenly on a footing which must do away

<P>all restraints.&nbsp; To think only of the licence which every

<P>rehearsal must tend to create.&nbsp; It is all very bad!

<P>Put yourself in Miss Crawford's place, Fanny.

<P>Consider what it would be to act Amelia with a stranger.

<P>She has a right to be felt for, because she evidently

<P>feels for herself.&nbsp; I heard enough of what she said to you

<P>last night to understand her unwillingness to be acting

<P>with a stranger; and as she probably engaged in the part

<P>with different expectations--perhaps without considering

<P>the subject enough to know what was likely to be--

<P>it would be ungenerous, it would be really wrong to

<P>expose her to it.&nbsp; Her feelings ought to be respected.

<P>Does it not strike you so, Fanny?&nbsp; You hesitate."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I am sorry for Miss Crawford; but I am more sorry to see

<P>you drawn in to do what you had resolved against, and what

<P>you are known to think will be disagreeable to my uncle.

<P>It will be such a triumph to the others!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"They will not have much cause of triumph when they

<P>see how infamously I act.&nbsp; But, however, triumph there

<P>certainly will be, and I must brave it.&nbsp; But if I can be

<P>the means of restraining the publicity of the business,

<P>of limiting the exhibition, of concentrating our folly,

<P>I shall be well repaid.&nbsp; As I am now, I have no influence,

<P>I can do nothing:&nbsp; I have offended them, and they will

<P>not hear me; but when I have put them in good-humour

<P>by this concession, I am not without hopes of persuading

<P>them to confine the representation within a much

<P>smaller circle than they are now in the high road for.

<P>This will be a material gain.&nbsp; My object is to confine

<P>it to Mrs. Rushworth and the Grants.&nbsp; Will not this be

<P>worth gaining?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Yes, it will be a great point."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"But still it has not your approbation.&nbsp; Can you mention

<P>any other measure by which I have a chance of doing

<P>equal good?"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No, I cannot think of anything else."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Give me your approbation, then, Fanny.&nbsp; I am not

<P>comfortable without it."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"Oh, cousin!"
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"If you are against me, I ought to distrust myself,

<P>and yet--But it is absolutely impossible to let Tom

<P>go on in this way, riding about the country in quest

<P>of anybody who can be persuaded to act--no matter whom:

<P>the look of a gentleman is to be enough.&nbsp; I thought _you_

<P>would have entered more into Miss Crawford's feelings."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"No doubt she will be very glad.&nbsp; It must be a great relief

<P>to her," said Fanny, trying for greater warmth of manner.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She never appeared more amiable than in her behaviour

<P>to you last night.&nbsp; It gave her a very strong claim

<P>on my goodwill."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"She _was_ very kind, indeed, and I am glad to have her

<P>spared"...
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>She could not finish the generous effusion.&nbsp; Her conscience

<P>stopt her in the middle, but Edmund was satisfied.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>"I shall walk down immediately after breakfast," said he,

<P>"and am sure of giving pleasure there.&nbsp; And now, dear Fanny,

<P>I will not interrupt you any longer.&nbsp; You want to be reading.

<P>But I could not be easy till I had spoken to you,

<P>and come to a decision.&nbsp; Sleeping or waking, my head

<P>has been full of this matter all night.&nbsp; It is an evil,

<P>but I am certainly making it less than it might be.

<P>If Tom is up, I shall go to him directly and get it over,

<P>and when we meet at breakfast we shall be all in high

<P>good-humour at the prospect of acting the fool together

<P>with such unanimity.&nbsp; _You_, in the meanwhile, will be taking

<P>a trip into China, I suppose.&nbsp; How does Lord Macartney

<P>go on?"--opening a volume on the table and then taking up

<P>some others.&nbsp; "And here are Crabbe's Tales, and the Idler,

<P>at hand to relieve you, if you tire of your great book.

<P>I admire your little establishment exceedingly; and as

<P>soon as I am gone, you will empty your head of all this

<P>nonsense of acting, and sit comfortably down to your table.

<P>But do not stay here to be cold."
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>He went; but there was no reading, no China, no composure

<P>for Fanny.&nbsp; He had told her the most extraordinary,

<P>the most inconceivable, the most unwelcome news;

<P>and she could think of nothing else.&nbsp; To be acting!

<P>After all his objections--objections so just and so public!

<P>After all that she had heard him say, and seen him look,

<P>and known him to be feeling.&nbsp; Could it be possible?

<P>Edmund so inconsistent!&nbsp; Was he not deceiving himself?

<P>Was he not wrong?&nbsp; Alas! it was all Miss Crawford's doing.

<P>She had seen her influence in every speech, and was miserable.

<P>The doubts and alarms as to her own conduct, which had previously

<P>distressed her, and which had all slept while she listened

<P>to him, were become of little consequence now.&nbsp; This deeper

<P>anxiety swallowed them up.&nbsp; Things should take their course;

<P>she cared not how it ended.&nbsp; Her cousins might attack,

<P>but could hardly tease her.&nbsp; She was beyond their reach;

<P>and if at last obliged to yield--no matter--it was all

<P>misery now.
