<BLOCKQUOTE>`<I>Yea, many there be that have run out of their wits for

The schoolmaster was leaving the village, and everybody seemed sorry. The
miller at Cresscombe lent him the small white tilted cart and horse to
carry his goods to the city of his destination, about twenty miles off,
such a vehicle proving of quite sufficient size for the departing teacher's
effects. For the schoolhouse had been partly furnished by the managers,
and the only cumbersome article possessed by the master, in addition to
the packing-case of books, was a cottage piano that he had bought at an
auction during the year in which he thought of learning instrumental music.
But the enthusiasm having waned he had never acquired any skill in playing,
and the purchased article had been a perpetual trouble to him ever since
in moving house.

<P>&nbsp;The rector had gone away for the day, being a man who disliked
the sight of changes. He did not mean to return till the evening, when
the new school-teacher would have arrived and settled in, and everything
would be smooth again.

<P>&nbsp;The blacksmith, the farm bailiff, and the schoolmaster himself
were standing in perplexed attitudes in the parlour before the instrument.
The master had remarked that even if he got it into the cart he should
not know what to do with it on his arrival at Christminster, the city he
was bound for, since he was only going into temporary lodgings just at
first.

<P>&nbsp;A little boy of eleven, who had been thoughtfully assisting in
the packing, joined the group of men, and as they rubbed their chins he
spoke up, blushing at the sound of his own voice: `Aunt have got a great
fuel-house, and it could be put there, perhaps, till you've found a place
to settle in, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;`A proper good notion,' said the blacksmith.

<P>&nbsp;It was decided that a deputation should wait on the boy's aunt
- an old maiden resident - and ask her if she would house the piano till
Mr. Phillotson should send for it. The smith and the bailiff started to
see about the practicability of the suggested shelter, and the boy and
the schoolmaster were left standing alone.

<P>&nbsp;`Sorry I am going, Jude?' asked the latter kindly.

<P>&nbsp;Tears rose into the boy's eyes, for he was not among the regular
day scholars, who came unromantically close to the schoolmaster's life,
but one who had attended the night school only during the present teacher's
term of office. The regular scholars, if the truth must be told, stood
at the present moment afar off, like certain historic disciples, indisposed
to any enthusiastic volunteering of aid.

<P>&nbsp;The boy awkwardly opened the book he held in his hand, which Mr.
Phillotson had bestowed on him as a parting gift, and admitted that he
was sorry.

<P>&nbsp;`So am I,' said Mr. Phillotson.

<P>&nbsp;`Why do you go, sir?' asked the boy.

<P>&nbsp;`Ah - that would be a long story. You wouldn't understand my reasons,
Jude. You will, perhaps, when you are older.'

<P>&nbsp;`I think I should now, sir.'

<P>&nbsp;`Well - don't speak of this everywhere. You know what a university
is, and a university degree? It is the necessary hallmark of a man who
wants to do anything in teaching. My scheme, or dream, is to be a university
graduate, and then to be ordained. By going to live at Christminster, or
near it, I shall be at headquarters, so to speak, and if my scheme is practicable
at all, I consider that being on the spot will afford me a better chance
of carrying it out than I should have elsewhere.'

<P>&nbsp;The smith and his companion returned. Old Miss Fawley's fuel-house
was dry, and eminently practicable; and she seemed willing to give the
instrument standing-room there. It was accordingly left in the school till
the evening, when more hands would be available for removing it; and the
schoolmaster gave a final glance round.

<P>&nbsp;The boy Jude assisted in loading some small articles, and at nine
o'clock Mr. Phillotson mounted beside his box of books and other <I>impedimenta</I>,
and bade his friends good-bye.

<P>&nbsp;`I shan't forget you, Jude,' he said, smiling, as the cart moved
off. `Be a good boy, remember; and be kind to animals and birds, and read
all you can. And if ever you come to Christminster remember you hunt me
out for old acquaintance' sake.'

<P>&nbsp;The cart creaked across the green, and disappeared round the corner
by the rectory-house. The boy returned to the draw-well at the edge of
the greensward, where he had left his buckets when he went to help his
patron and teacher in the loading. There was a quiver in his lip now and
after opening the well-cover to begin lowering the bucket he paused and
leant with his forehead and arms against the framework, his face wearing
the fixity of a thoughtful child's who has felt the pricks of life somewhat
before his time. The well into which he was looking was as ancient as the
village itself, and from his present position appeared as a long circular
perspective ending in a shining disk of quivering water at a distance of
a hundred feet down. There was a lining of green moss near the top, and
nearer still the hart's-tongue fern.

<P>&nbsp;He said to himself, in the melodramatic tones of a whimsical boy,
that the schoolmaster had drawn at that well scores of times on a morning
like this, and would never draw there any more. `I've seen him look down
into it, when he was tired with his drawing, just as I do now, and when
he rested a bit before carrying the buckets home! But he was too clever
to bide here any longer - a small sleepy place like this!'

<P>&nbsp;A tear rolled from his eye into the depths of the well. The morning
was a little foggy, and the boy's breathing unfurled itself as a thicker
fog upon the still and heavy air. His thoughts were interrupted by a sudden
outcry:

<P>&nbsp;`Bring on that water, will ye, you idle young harlican!'

<P>&nbsp;It came from an old woman who had emerged from her door towards
the garden gate of a green-thatched cottage not far off. The boy quickly
waved a signal of assent, drew the water with what was a great effort for
one of his stature, landed and emptied the big bucket into his own pair
of smaller ones, and pausing a moment for breath, started with them across
the patch of clammy greensward whereon the well stood - nearly in the centre
of the little village, or rather hamlet of Marygreen.

<P>&nbsp;It was as old-fashioned as it was small, and it rested in the
lap of an undulating upland adjoining the North Wessex downs. Old as it
was, however, the well-shaft was probably the only relic of the local history
that remained absolutely unchanged. Many of the thatched and dormered dwelling-houses
had been pulled down of late years, and many trees felled on the green.
Above all, the original church, hump-backed, wood-turreted, and quaintly
hipped, had been taken down, and either cracked up into heaps of road-metal
in the lane, or utilized as pig-sty walls, garden seats, guard-stones to
fences, and rockeries in the flower-beds of the neighbourhood. In place
of it a tall new building of modern Gothic design, unfamiliar to English
eyes, had been erected on a new piece of ground by a certain obliterator
of historic records who had run down from London and back in a day. The
site whereon so long had stood the ancient temple to the Christian divinities
was not even recorded on the green and level grass-plot that had immemorially
been the churchyard, the obliterated graves being commemorated by eighteen-penny
castiron crosses warranted to last five years.
