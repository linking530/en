Chapter 21</H1>
There was a great stir in the milk-house just after breakfast. The churn
revolved as usual, but the butter would not come. Whenever this happened
the dairy was paralyzed. Squish, squash, echoed the milk in the great cylinder,
but never arose the sound they waited for.

<P>Dairyman Crick and his wife, the milkmaids Tess, Marian, Retty Priddle,
Izz Huett, and the married ones from the cottages; also Mr Clare, Jonathan
Kail, old Deborah, and the rest, stood gazing hopelessly at the churn;
and the boy who kept the horse going outside put on moon-like eyes to show
his sense of the situation. Even the melancholy horse himself seemed to
look in at the window in inquiring despair at each walk round.

<P>`'Tis years since I went to Conjuror Trendle's son in Egdon - years!'
said the dairyman bitterly. `And he was nothing to what his father had
been. I have said fifty times, if I have said once, that I don't believe
in en; though a' do cast folks' waters very true. But I shall have to go
to 'n if he's alive. O yes, I shall have to go to 'n, if this sort of thing
continnys!'

<P>Even Mr Clare began to feel tragical at the dairyman's desperation.

<P>`Conjuror Fall, t'other side of Casterbridge that they used to call
"Wide-O", was a very good man when I was a boy,' said Jonathan Kail. `But
he's rotten as touchwood by now.'

<P>`My grandfather used to go to Conjuror Mynterne, out at Owlscombe, and
a clever man a' were, so I've heard grandf'er say, continued Mr Crick.
`But there's no such genuine folk about nowadays!'

<P>Mrs Crick's mind kept nearer to the matter in hand.

<P>`Perhaps somebody in the house is in love,' she said tentatively. `I've
heard tell in my younger days that that will cause it. Why, Crick - that
maid we had years ago, do ye mind, and how the butter didn't come then--'

<P>`Ah yes, yes! - but that isn't the rights o't. It had nothing to do
with the love-making. I can mind all about it--'twas the damage to the
churn.'

<P>He turned to Clare.

<P>`Jack Dollop, a 'hore's-bird of a fellow we had here as milker at one
time, sir, courted a young woman over at Mellstock, and deceived her as
he had deceived many afore. But he had another sort o' woman to reckon
wi' this time, and it was not the girl herself. One Holy Thursday, of all
days in the almanack, we was where as we mid be now, only there was no
churning in hand, when we zid the girl's mother coming up to the door,
wi' a great brass-mounted umbrella in her hand that would ha' felled an
ox, and saying "Do Jack Dollop work here? - because I want him! I have
a big bone to pick with he, I can assure 'n!" And some way behind her mother
walked Jack's young woman, crying bitterly into her handkercher. "O Lard,
here's a time!" said jack, looking out o' winder at 'em. "She'll murder
me! Where shall I get-where shall I - ? Don't tell her where I be!" And
with that he scrambled into the churn through the trap-door, and shut himself
inside, just as the young woman's mother busted into the milk-house. "The
villain - where is he?" says she, "I'll claw his face for'n, let me only
catch him!" Well, she hunted about everywhere, ballyragging Jack by side
and by seam, Jack lying a'most stifled inside the churn, and the poor maid
- or young woman rather - standing at the door crying her eyes out. I shall
never forget it, never! 'Twould have melted a marble stone! But she couldn't
find him nowhere at all.'

<P>The dairyman paused, and one or two words of comment came from the listeners.

<P>Dairyman Crick's stories often seemed to be ended when they were not
really so, and strangers were betrayed into premature interjections of
finality; though old friends knew better. The narrator went on--

<P>`Well, how the old woman should have had the wit to guess it I could
never tell, but she found out that he was inside that there churn. Without
saying a word she took hold of the winch (it was turned by handpower then),
and round she swung him, and jack began to flop about inside. "O Lard!
stop the churn! let me out!" says he, popping out his head, "I shall be
churned into a pummy!" (he was a cowardly chap in his heart, as such men
mostly be). "Not till ye make amends for ravaging her virgin innocence!"
says the old woman. "Stop the churn, you old witch!" screams he. "You call
me old witch, do ye, you deceiver!" says she, "when ye ought to ha' been
calling me mother-law these last five months!" And on went the churn, and
Jack's bones rattled round again. Well, none of us ventured to interfere;
and at last 'a promised to make it right wi' her. "Yes - I'll be as good
as my word!" he said. And so it ended that day.'

<P>While the listeners were smiling their comments there was a quick movement
behind their backs, and they looked round. Tess, pale-faced, had gone to
the door.

<P>`How warm 'tis to-day!' she said, almost inaudibly.

<P>It was warm, and none of them connected her withdrawal with the reminiscences
of the dairyman. He went forward, and opened the door for her, saying with
tender raillery--

<P>`Why, maidy' (he frequently, with unconscious irony, gave her this pet
name), `the prettiest milker I've got in my dairy; you mustn't get so fagged
as this at the first breath of summer weather, or we shall be finely put
to for want of 'ee by dog-days, shan't we, Mr Clare?'

<P>`I was faint - and - I think I am better out o' doors,' she said mechanically;
and disappeared outside.

<P>Fortunately for her the milk in the revolving churn at that moment changed
its squashing for a decided flick-flack.

<P>`'Tis coming!' cried Mrs Crick, and the attention of all was called
off from Tess.

<P>That fair sufferer soon recovered herself externally, but she remained
much depressed all the afternoon. When the evening milking was done she
did not care to be with the rest of them, and went out of doors wandering
along she knew not whither. She was wretched - O so wretched - at the perception
that to her companions the dairyman's story had been rather a humorous
narration than otherwise; none of them but herself seemed to see the sorrow
of it; to a certainty, not one knew how cruelly it touched the tender place
in her experience. The evening sun was now ugly to her, like a great inflamed
wound in the sky. Only a solitary cracked-voiced reed-sparrow greeted her
from the bushes by the river, in a sad, machine-made tone, resembling that
of a past friend whose friendship she had outworn.

<P>In these long June days the milkmaids, and, indeed, most of the household,
went to bed at sunset or sooner, the morning work before milking being
so early and heavy at a time of full pails. Tess usually accompanied her
fellows upstairs. To-night, however, she was the first to go to their common
chamber; and she had dozed when the other girls came in. She saw them undressing
in the orange light of the vanished sun, which flushed their forms with
its colour; she dozed again, but she was reawakened by their voices, and
quietly turned her eyes towards them.

<P>Neither of her three chamber-companions had got into bed. They were
standing in a group, in their nightgowns, barefooted, at the window, the
last red rays of the west still warming their faces and necks, and the
walls around them. All were watching somebody in the garden with deep interest,
their three faces close together: a jovial and round one, a pale one with
dark hair and a fair one whose tresses were auburn.

<P>`Don't push! You can see as well as I,' said Retty, the auburn-haired
and youngest girl, without removing her eyes from the window.

<P>`'Tis no use for you to be in love with him any more than me, Retty
Priddle,' said jolly-faced Marian, the eldest, silly. `His thoughts be
of other cheeks than thine!'

<P>Retty Priddle still looked, and the others looked again.

<P>`There he is again!' cried Izz Huett, the pale girl with dark damp hair
and keenly cut lips.

<P>`You needn't say anything, Izz,' answered Retty. `For I zid you kissing
his shade.'

<P><I>`What</I> did you see her doing?' asked Marian.

<P>`Why - he was standing over the whey-tub to let off the whey, and the
shade of his face came upon the wall behind, close to Izz, who was standing
there filling a vat. She put her mouth against the wall and kissed the
shade of his mouth; I zid her, though he didn't.'

<P>`O Izz Huett!' said Marian.

<P>A rosy spot came into the middle of Izz Huett's cheek.

<P>`Well, there was no harm in it,' she declared, with attempted coolness.
`And if I be in love wi'en, so is Retty, too; and so be you, Marian, come
to that.'

<P>Marian's full face could not blush past its chronic pinkness.

<P>`I!' she said. `What a tale! Ah, there he is again! Dear eyes - dear
face - dear Mr Clare!'

<P>`There - you've owned it!'

<P>`So have you - so have we all,' said Marian, with the dry frankness
of complete indifference to opinion. `It is silly to pretend otherwise
amongst ourselves, though we need not own it to other folks. I would just
marry 'n to-morrow!'

<P>`So would I - and more,' murmured Izz Huett.

<P>`And I too,' whispered the more timid Retty.

<P>The listener grew warm.

<P>`We can't all marry him,' said Izz.

<P>`We shan't, either of us; which is worse still,' said the eldest. `There
he is again!'

<P>They all three blew him a silent kiss.

<P>`Why?' asked Retty quickly.

<P>`Because he likes Tess Durbeyfield best,' said Marian, lowering her
voice. `I have watched him every day, and have found it out.'

<P>There was a reflective silence.

<P>`But she don't care anything for 'n?' at length breathed Retty.

<P>`Well - I sometimes think that too.'

<P>`But how silly all this is!' said Izz Huett impatiently. `Of course
he won't marry any one of us, or Tess either - a gentleman's son, who's
going to be a great landowner and farmer abroad! More likely to ask us
to come wi'en as farm-hands at so much a year!'

<P>One sighed, and another sighed, and Marian's plump figure sighed biggest
of all. Somebody in bed hard by sighed too. Tears came into the eyes of
Retty Priddle, the pretty red-haired youngest - the last bud of the Paridelles,
so important in the county annals. They watched silently a little longer,
their three faces still close together as before, and the triple hues of
their hair mingling. But the unconscious Mr Clare had gone indoors, and
they saw him no more; and, the shades beginning to deepen, they crept into
their beds. In a few minutes they heard him ascend the ladder to his own
room. Marian was soon snoring, but Izz did not drop into forgetfulness
for a long time. Retty Priddle cried herself to sleep.

<P>The deeper-passioned Tess was very far from sleeping even then. This
conversation was another of the bitter pills she had been obliged to swallow
that day. Scarce the least feeling of jealousy arose in her breast. For
that matter she knew herself to have the preference. Being more finely
formed, better educated, and, though the youngest except Retty, more woman
than either, she perceived that only the slightest ordinary care was necessary
for holding her own in Angel Clare's heart against these her candid friends.
But the grave question was, ought she to do this? There was, to be sure,
hardly a ghost of a chance for either of them, in a serious sense; but
there was, or had been, a chance of one or the other inspiring him with
a passing fancy for her, and enjoying the pleasure of his attentions while
he stayed here. Such unequal attachments had led to marriage; and she had
heard from Mrs Crick that Mr Clare had one day asked, in a laughing way,
what would be the use of his marrying a fine lady, and all the while ten
thousand acres of Colonial pasture to feed, and cattle to rear, and corn
to reap. A farm-woman would be the only sensible kind of wife for him.
But whether Mr Clare had spoken seriously or not, why should she, who could
never conscientiously allow any man to marry her now, and who had religiously
determined that she never would be tempted to do so, draw off Mr Clare's
attention from other women, for the brief happiness of sunning herself
in his eyes while he remained at Talbothays?
