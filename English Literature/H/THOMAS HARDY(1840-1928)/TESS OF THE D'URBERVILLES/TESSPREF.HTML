Preface to the Fifth and Later Editions</H1>


<P>This novel being one wherein the great campaign of the heroine begins
after an event in her experience which has usually been treated as fatal
to her part of protagonist, or at least as the virtual ending of her enterprises
and hopes, it was quite contrary to avowed conventions that the public
should welcome the book, and agree with me in holding that there was something
more to be said in fiction than had been said about the shaded side of
a well-known catastrophe. But the responsive spirit in which <I>Tess of
the d'Urbervilles</I> has been received by the readers of England and America,
would seem to prove that the plan of laying down a story on the lines of
tacit opinion, instead of making it to square with the merely vocal formulae
of society, is not altogether a wrong one, even when exemplified in so
unequal and partial an achievement as the present. For this responsiveness
I cannot refrain from expressing my thanks; and my regret is that, in a
world where one so often hungers in vain for friendship, where even not
to be wilfully misunderstood is felt as a kindness, I shall never meet
in person these appreciative readers, male and female, and shake them by
the hand.

<P>I include amongst them the reviewers - by far the majority - who have
so generously welcomed the tale. Their words show that they, like the others,
have only too largely repaired my defects of narration by their own imaginative
intuition.

<P>Nevertheless, though the novel was intended to be neither didactic nor
aggressive, but in the scenic parts to be representative simply, and in
the contemplative to be oftener charged with impressions than with convictions,
there have been objectors both to the matter and to the rendering.

<P>The more austere of these maintain a conscientious difference of opinion
concerning, among other things, subjects fit for art, and reveal an inability
to associate the idea of the sub-title adjective with any but the artificial
and derivative meaning which has resulted to it from the ordinances of
civilization. They ignore the meaning of the word in Nature, together with
all aesthetic claims upon it, not to mention the spiritual interpretation
afforded by the finest side of their own Christianity. Others dissent on
grounds which are intrinsically no more than an assertion that the novel
embodies the views of life prevalent at the end of the nineteenth century,
and not those of an earlier and simpler generation - an assertion which
I can only hope may be well founded. Let me repeat that a novel is ail
impression, not an argument; and there the matter must rest; as one is
reminded by a passage which occurs in the letters of Schiller to Goethe
on judges of this class: `They are those who seek only their own ideas
in a representation, and prize that which should be as higher than what
is. The cause of the dispute, therefore, lies in the very first principles,
and it would be utterly impossible to come to an understanding with them.'
And again: `As soon as I observe that any one, when judging of poetical
representations, considers anything more important than the inner Necessity
and Truth, I have done with him.'

<P>In the introductory words to the first edition I suggested the possible
advent of the genteel person who would not be able to endure something
or other in these pages. That person duly appeared among the aforesaid
objectors. In one case he felt upset that it was not possible for him to
read the book through three times, owing to my not having made that critical
effort which `alone can prove the salvation of such an one'. In another,
he objected to such vulgar articles as the Devil's pitchfork, a lodging-house
carving-knife, and a shame-bought parasol, appearing in a respectable story.
In another place he was a gentleman who turned Christian for half-an-hour
the better to express his grief that a disrespectful phrase about the Immortals
should have been used; though the same innate gentility compelled him to
excuse the author in words of pity that one cannot be too thankful for:
`He does but give us of his best.' I can assure this great critic that
to exclaim illogically against the gods, singular or plural, is not such
an original sin of mine as he seems to imagine. True, it may have some
local originality; though if Shakespeare were an authority on history,
which perhaps he is not, I could show that the sin was introduced into
Wessex as early as the Heptarchy itself. Says Glo'ster in <I>Lear</I>,
otherwise Ina, king of that country:
<BLOCKQUOTE>As files to wanton boys are we to the gods;

<P>They kill us for their sport.</BLOCKQUOTE>
The remaining two or three manipulators of <I>Tess</I> were of the predetermined
sort whom most writers and readers would gladly forget; professed literary
boxers, who put on their convictions for the occasion; modern `Hammers
of Heretics'; sworn Discouragers, ever on the watch to prevent the tentative
half-success from becoming the whole success later on; who pervert plain
meanings, and grow personal under the name of practising the great historical
method. However, they may have causes to advance, privileges to guard,
traditions to keep going; some of which a mere tale-teller, who writes
down how the things of the world strike him, without any ulterior intentions
whatever, has overlooked, and may by pure inadvertence have run foul of
when in the least aggressive mood. Perhaps some passing perception, the
outcome of a dream hour, would, if generally acted on, cause such an assailant
considerable inconvenience with respect to position, interests, family,
servant, ox, ass neighbour, or neighbour's wife. He therefore valiantly
hides his personality behind a publisher's shutters, and cries `Shame!'
So densely is the world thronged that any shifting of positions, even the
best warranted advance, galls somebody's kibe. Such shiftings often begin
in sentiment, and such sentiment sometimes begins in a novel.

<P>July 1892

<P>The foregoing remarks were written during the early career of this story,
when a spirited public and private criticism of its points was still fresh
to the feelings. The pages are allowed to stand for what they are worth,
as something once said; but probably they would not have been written now.
Even in the short time which has elapsed since the book was first published,
some of the critics who provoked the reply have `gone down into silence',
as if to remind one of the infinite unimportance of both their say and
mine.

<P>January 1895

<P>The present edition of this novel contains a few pages that have never
appeared in any previous edition. When the detached episodes were collected
as stated in the preface of 1891, these pages were overlooked, though they
were in the original manuscript. They occur in chapter 10.

<P>Respecting the sub-title, to which allusion was made above, I may add
that it was appended at the last moment, after reading the final proofs,
as being the estimate left in a candid mind of the heroine's character
- an estimate that nobody would be likely to dispute. It was disputed more
than anything else in the book. <I>Melius fuerat non scribere.</I> But
there it stands.

<P>The novel was first published complete, in three volumes, in November
1891.&nbsp;
