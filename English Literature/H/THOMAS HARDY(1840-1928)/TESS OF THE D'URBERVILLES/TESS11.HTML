Chapter 11</H1>
The twain cantered along for some time without speech, Tess as she clung
to him still panting in her triumph, yet in other respects dubious. She
had perceived that the horse was not the spirited one he sometimes rode,
and felt no alarm on that score, though her seat was precarious enough
despite her tight hold of him. She begged him to slow the animal to a walk,
which Alec accordingly did.

<P>`Neatly done, was it not, dear Tess?' he said by and by.

<P>`Yes!' said she. `I am sure I ought to be much obliged to you.'

<P>`And are you?'

<P>She did not reply.

<P>`Tess, why do you always dislike my kissing you?'

<P>`I suppose - because I don't love you.'

<P>`You are quite sure?'

<P>`I am angry with you sometimes!'

<P>`Ah, I half feared as much.' Nevertheless, Alec did not object to that
confession. He knew that anything was better than frigidity. `Why haven't
you told me when I have made you angry?'

<P>`You know very well why. Because I cannot help myself here.'

<P>`I haven't offended you often by love-making?'

<P>`You have sometimes.'

<P>`How many times?'

<P>`You know as well as I - too many times.'

<P>`Every time I have tried.'

<P>She was silent, and the horse ambled along for a considerable distance,
till a faint luminous fog, which had hung in the hollows all the evening,
became general and enveloped them. It seemed to hold the moonlight in suspension,
rendering it more pervasive than in clear air. Whether on this account,
or from absentmindedness, or from sleepiness, she did not perceive that
they had long ago passed the point at which the lane to Trantridge branched
from the highway, and that her conductor had not taken the Trantridge track.

<P>She was inexpressibly weary. She had risen at five o'clock every morning
of that week, had been on foot the whole of each day and on this evening
had in addition walked the three miles to Chaseborough, waited three hours
for her neighbours without eating or drinking, her impatience to start
them preventing either; she had then walked a mile of the way home, and
had undergone the excitement of the quarrel, till, with the slow progress
of their steed, it was now nearly one o'clock. Only once, however, was
she overcome by actual drowsiness. In that moment of oblivion her head
sank gently against him.

<P>D'Urberville stopped the horse, withdrew his feet from the stirrups,
turned sideways on the saddle, and enclosed her waist with his arm to support
her.

<P>This immediately put her on the defensive, and with one of those sudden
impulses of reprisal to which she was liable she gave him a little push
from her. In his ticklish position he nearly lost his balance and only
just avoided rolling over into the road, the horse, though a powerful one,
being fortunately the quietest he rode.

<P>`That is devilish unkind!' he said. `I mean no harm - only to keep you
from failing.'

<P>She pondered suspiciously; till, thinking that this might after all
be true, she relented, and said quite humbly, `I beg your pardon, sir.'

<P>`I won't pardon you unless you show some confidence in me. Good God!'
he burst out, `what am I, to be repulsed so by a mere chit like you? For
near three mortal months have you trifled with my feelings, eluded me,
and snubbed me; and I won't stand it!'

<P>`I'll leave you to-morrow, sir.'

<P>`No, you will not leave me to-morrow! Will you, I ask once more, show
your belief in me by letting me clasp you with my arm? Come, between us
two and nobody else, now. We know each other well; and you know that I
love you, and think you the prettiest girl in the world, which you are.
Mayn't I treat you as a lover?'

<P>She drew a quick pettish breath of objection, writhing uneasily on her
seat, looked far ahead, and murmured, `I don't know - I wish - how can
I say yes or no when--'

<P>He settled the matter by clasping his arm round her as he desired, and
Tess expressed no further negative. Thus they sidled slowly onward till
it struck her they had been advancing for an unconscionable time - far
longer than was usually occupied by the short journey from Chaseborough,
even at this walking pace, and that they were no longer on hard road, but
in a mere trackway.

<P>`Why, where be we?' she exclaimed.

<P>`Passing by a wood.'

<P>`A wood - what wood? Surely we are quite out of the road?'

<P>`A bit of The Chase - the oldest wood in England. It is a lovely night,
and why should we not prolong our ride a little?'

<P>`How could you be so treacherous!' said Tess, between archness and real
dismay, and getting rid of his arm by pulling open his fingers one by one,
though at the risk of slipping off herself. `Just when I've been putting
such trust in you, and obliging you to please you, because I thought I
had wronged you by that push! Please set me down, and let me walk home.'

<P>`You cannot walk home, darling, even if the air were clear. We are miles
away from Trantridge, if I must tell you, and in this growing fog you might
wander for hours among these trees.'

<P>`Never mind that,' she coaxed. `Put me down, I beg you. I don't mind
where it is; only let me get down, sir, please!'

<P>`Very well, then, I will - on one condition. Having brought you here
to this out-of-the-way place, I feel myself responsible for your safe-conduct
home, whatever you may yourself feel about it. As to your getting to Trantridge
without assistance, it is quite impossible; for, to tell the truth, dear,
owing to this fog, which so disguises everything, I don't quite know where
we are myself. Now, if you will promise to wait beside the horse while
I walk through the bushes till I come to some road or house, and ascertain
exactly our whereabouts, I'll deposit you here willingly. When I come back
I'll give you full directions, and if you insist upon walking you may;
or you may ride - at your pleasure.'

<P>She accepted these terms, and slid off on the near side, though not
till he had stolen a cursory kiss. He sprang down on the other side.

<P>`I suppose I must hold the horse?' said she.

<P>`Oh no; it's not necessary,' replied Alec, patting the panting creature.
`He's had enough of it for to-night.'

<P>He turned the horse's head into the bushes, hitched him on to a bough,
and made a sort of couch or nest for her in the deep mass of dead leaves.

<P>`Now, you sit there,' he said. `The leaves have not got damp as yet.
Just give an eye to the horse - it will be quite sufficient.'

<P>He took a few steps away from her, but, returning, said, `By the bye,
Tess, your father has a new cob to-day. Somebody gave it to him.'

<P>`Somebody? You!'

<P>D'Urberville nodded.

<P>`O how very good of you that is!' she exclaimed, with a painful sense
of the awkwardness of having to thank him just then.

<P>`And the children have some toys.'

<P>`I didn't know - you ever sent them anything!' she murmured, much moved.
`I almost wish you had not - yes, I almost wish it!'

<P>`Why, dear?'

<P>`It - hampers me so.'

<P>`Tessy - don't you love me ever so little now?'

<P>`I'm grateful,' she reluctantly admitted. `But I fear I do not--' The
sudden vision of his passion for herself as a factor in this result so
distressed her that, beginning with one slow tear, and then following with
another, she wept outright.

<P>`Don't cry, dear, dear one! Now sit down here, and wait till I come.'
She passively sat down amid the leaves he had heaped, and shivered slightly.
`Are you cold?' he asked.

<P>`Not very - a little.'

<P>He touched her with his fingers, which sank into her as into down. `You
have only that puffy muslin dress on - how's that?'

<P>`It's my best summer one. 'Twas very warm when I started, and I didn't
know I was going to ride, and that it would be night.'

<P>`Nights grow chilly in September. Let me see.' He pulled off a light
overcoat that he had worn, and put it round her tenderly. `That's it -
now you'll feel warmer,' he continued. `Now, my pretty, rest there; I shall
soon be back again.'

<P>Having buttoned the overcoat round her shoulders he plunged into the
webs of vapour which by this time formed veils between the trees. She could
hear the rustling of the branches as he ascended the adjoining slope, till
his movements were no louder than the hopping of a bird, and finally died
away. With the setting of the moon the pale light lessened, and Tess became
invisible as she fell into reverie upon the leaves where he had left her.

<P>In the meantime Alec d'Urberville had pushed on up the slope to clear
his genuine doubt as to the quarter of The Chase they were in. He had,
in fact, ridden quite at random for over an hour, taking any turning that
came to hand in order to prolong companionship with her, and giving far
more attention to Tess's moonlit person than to any wayside object. A little
rest for the jaded animal being desirable, he did not hasten his search
for landmarks. A clamber over the hill into the adjoining vale brought
him to the fence of a highway whose contours he recognized, which settled
the question of their whereabouts. D'Urberville thereupon turned back;
but by this time the moon had quite gone down, and partly on account of
the fog The Chase was wrapped in thick darkness, although morning was not
far off. He was obliged to advance with outstretched hands to avoid contact
with the boughs, and discovered that to hit the exact spot from which he
had started was at first entirely beyond him. Roaming up and down, round
and round, he at length heard a slight movement of the horse close at hand;
and the sleeve of his overcoat unexpectedly caught his foot.

<P>`Tess!' said d'Urberville.

<P>There was no answer. The obscurity was now so great that he could see
absolutely nothing but a pale nebulousness at his feet, which represented
the white muslin figure he had left upon the dead leaves. Everything else
was blackness alike. D'Urberville stooped; and heard a gentle regular breathing.
He knelt and bent lower, till her breath warmed his face, and in a moment
his cheek was in contact with hers. She was sleeping soundly, and upon
her eyelashes there lingered tears.

<P>Darkness and silence ruled everywhere around. Above them rose the primeval
yews and oaks of The Chase, in which were poised gentle roosting birds
in their last nap; and about them stole the hopping rabbits and hares.
But, might some say, where was Tess's guardian angel? where was the providence
of her simple faith? Perhaps, like that other god of whom the ironical
Tishbite spoke, he was talking, or he was pursuing, or he was in a journey,
or he was sleeping and not to be awaked.

<P>Why it was that upon this beautiful feminine tissue, sensitive as gossamer,
and practically blank as snow as yet, there should have been traced such
a coarse pattern as it was doomed to receive; why so often the coarse appropriates
the finer thus, the wrong man the woman, the wrong woman the man, many
thousand years of analytical philosophy have failed to explain to our sense
of order. One may, indeed, admit the possibility of a retribution lurking
in the present catastrophe. Doubtless some of Tess d'Urberville's mailed
ancestors rollicking home from a fray had dealt the same measure even more
ruthlessly towards peasant girls of their time. But though to visit the
sins of the fathers upon the children may be a morality good enough for
divinities, it is scorned by average human nature; and it therefore does
not mend the matter.

<P>As Tess's own people down in those retreats are never tired of saying
among each other in their fatalistic way: `It was to be.' There lay the
pity of it. An immeasurable social chasm was to divide our heroine's personality
thereafter from that previous self of hers who stepped from her mother's
door to try her fortune at Trantridge poultry-farm.
