Chapter 42</H1>
It was now broad day, and she started again, emerging cautiously upon the
highway. But there was no need for caution; not a soul was at hand, and
Tess went onward with fortitude, her recollection of the birds' silent
endurance of their night of agony impressing upon her the relativity of
sorrows and the tolerable nature of her own, if she could once rise high
enough to despise opinion. But that she could not do so long as it was
held by Clare.

<P>She reached Chalk-Newton, and breakfasted at an inn, where several young
men were troublesomely complimentary to her good looks. Somehow she felt
hopeful, for was it not possible that her husband also might say these
same things to her even yet? She was bound to take care of herself on the
chance of it, and keep off these casual lovers. To this end Tess resolved
to run no further risks from her appearance. As soon as she got out of
the village she entered a thicket and took from her basket one of the oldest
field-gowns, which she had never put on even at the dairy - never since
she had worked among the stubble at Marlott. She also, by a felicitous
thought, took a handkerchief from her bundle and tied it round her face
under her bonnet, covering her chin and half her cheeks and temples, as
if she were suffering from toothache. Then with her little scissors, by
the aid of a pocket looking-glass, she mercilessly nipped her eyebrows
off, and thus insured against aggressive admiration she went on her uneven
way.

<P>`What a mommet of a maid!' said the next man who met her to a companion.

<P>Tears came into her eyes for very pity of herself as she heard him.

<P>`But I don't care!' she said. `O no - I don't care! I'll always be ugly
now, because Angel is not here, and I have nobody to take care of me. My
husband that was is gone away, and never will love me any more; but I love
him `just the same, and hate all other men, and like to make 'em think
scornfully of me!'

<P>Thus Tess walks on; a figure which is part of the landscape; a fieldwoman
pure and simple, in winter guise; a gray serge cape, a red woollen cravat,
a stuff skirt covered by a whitey-brown rough wrapper; and buff-leather
gloves. Every thread of that old attire has become faded and thin under
the stroke of raindrops, the burn of sunbeams, and the stress of winds.
There is no sign of young passion in her now--

Inside this exterior, over which the eye might have roved as over a thing
scarcely percipient, almost inorganic, there was the record of a pulsing
life which had learnt too well, for its years, of the dust and ashes of
things, of the cruelty of lust and the fragility of love.

<P>Next day the weather was bad, but she trudged on, the honesty, directness,
and impartiality of elemental enmity disconcerting her but little. Her
object being a winter's occupation and a winter's home, there was no time
to lose. Her experience of short hirings had been such that she was determined
to accept no more.

<P>Thus she went forward from farm to farm in the direction of the place
whence Marian had written to her, which she determined to make use of as
a last shift only, its rumoured stringencies being the reverse of tempting.
First she inquired for the lighter kinds of employment, and, as acceptance
in any variety of these grew hopeless, applied next for the less light,
till, beginning with the dairy and poultry tendance that she liked best,
she ended with the heavy and coarse pursuits which she liked least - work
on arable land: work of such roughness, indeed, as she would never have
deliberately volunteered for.

<P>Towards the second evening she reached the irregular chalk table-land
or plateau, bosomed with semi-globular tumuli - as if Cybele the Many-breasted
were supinely extended there - which stretched between the valley of her
birth and the valley of her love.

<P>Here the air was dry and cold, and the long cart-roads were blown white
and dusty within a few hours after rain. There were few trees, or none,
those that would have grown in the hedges being mercilessly plashed down
with the quickset by the tenant-farmers, the natural enemies of tree, bush,
and brake. In the middle distance ahead of her she could see the summits
of Bulbarrow and of Nettlecombe Tout, and they seemed friendly. They had
a low and unassuming aspect from this upland, though as approached on the
other side from Blackmoor in her childhood they were as lofty bastions
against the sky. Southerly, at many miles' distance, and over the hills
and ridges coastward, she could discern a surface like polished steel:
it was the English Channel at a point far out towards France.

<P>Before her, in a slight depression, were the remains of a village. She
had, in fact, reached Flintcomb-Ash, the place of Marian's sojourn. There
seemed to be no help for it; hither she was doomed to come. The stubborn
soil around her showed plainly enough that the kind of labour in demand
here was of the roughest kind; but it was time to rest from searching,
and she resolved to stay, particularly as it began to rain. At the entrance
to the village was a cottage whose gable jutted into the road, and before
applying for a lodging she stood under its shelter, and watched the evening
close in.

<P>`Who would think I was Mrs Angel Clare!' she said.

<P>The wall felt warm to her back and shoulders, and she found that immediately
within the gable was the cottage fireplace, the heat of which came through
the bricks. She warmed her hands upon them, and also put her cheek - red
and moist with the drizzle - against their comforting surface. The wall
seemed to be the only friend she had. She had so little wish to leave it
that she could have stayed there all night.

<P>Tess could hear the occupants of the cottage - gathered together after
their day's labour - talking to each other within, and the rattle of their
supper-plates was also audible. But ill the village-street she had seen
no soul as yet. The solitude was at last broken by the approach of one
feminine figure, who, though the evening was cold, wore the print gown
and the tilt-bonnet of summer time. Tess instinctively thought it might
be Marian, and when she came near enough to be distinguishable in the gloom
surely enough it was she. Marian was even stouter and redder in the face
than formerly, and decidedly shabbier in attire. At any previous period
of her existence Tess would hardly have cared to renew the acquaintance
in such conditions; but her loneliness was excessive, and she responded
readily to Marian's greeting.

<P>Marian was quite respectful in her inquiries, but seemed much moved
by the fact that Tess should still continue in no better condition than
at first; though she had dimly heard of the separation.

<P>`Tess - Mrs Clare - the dear wife of dear he! And is it really so bad
as this, my child? Why is your cwomely face tied up in such a way? Anybody
been beating 'ee? Not <I>he</I>?'

<P>`No, no, no! I merely did it not to be clipsed or colled, Marian.'

<P>She pulled off in disgust a bandage which could suggest such wild thoughts.

<P>`And you've got no collar on' (Tess had been accustomed to wear a little
white collar at the dairy).

<P>`I know it, Marian.'

<P>`You've lost it travelling.'

<P>`I've not lost it. The truth is, I don't care anything about my looks;
and so I didn't put it on.'

<P>`And you don't wear your wedding-ring?'

<P>`Yes, I do; but not in public. I wear it round my neck on a ribbon.
I don't wish people to think who I am by marriage, or that I am married
at all; it would be so awkward while I lead my present life.' Marian paused.

<P>`But you <I>be</I> a gentleman's wife; and it seems hardly fair that
you should live like this!'

<P>`O yes it is, quite fair; though I am very unhappy.'

<P>`Well, well. <I>He</I> married you - and you can be unhappy!'

<P>`Wives are unhappy sometimes; from no fault of their husbands - from
their own.'

<P>`You've no faults, deary; that I'm sure of. And he's none. So it must
be something outside ye both.'

<P>`Marian, dear Marian, will you do me a good turn without asking questions?
My husband has gone abroad, and somehow I have overrun my allowance, so
that I have to fall back upon my old work for a time. Do not call me Mrs
Clare, but Tess, as before. Do they want a hand here?'

<P>`O yes; they'll take one always, because few care to come. 'Tis a starve-acre
place. Corn and swedes are all they grow. Though I be here myself, I feel
'tis a pity for such as you to come.'

<P>`But you used to be as good a dairy-woman as I.'

<P>`Yes; but I've got out o' that since I took to drink. Lord, that's the
only comfort I've got now! If you engage, you'll be set swedehacking. That's
what I be doing; but you won't like it.'

<P>`O - anything! Will you speak for me?'

<P>`You will do better by speaking for yourself.'

<P>`Very well. Now, Marian, remember - nothing about <I>him</I>, if I get
the place. I don't wish to bring his name down to the dirt.'

<P>Marian, who was really a trustworthy girl though of coarser grain than
Tess, promised anything she asked.

<P>`This is pay-night,' she said, `and if you were to come with me you
would know at once. I be real sorry that you are not happy; but 'tis because
he's away, I know. You couldn't be unhappy if he were here, even if he
gie'd ye no money - even if he used you like a drudge.'

<P>`That's true; I could not!'

<P>They walked on together, and soon reached the farmhouse, which was almost
sublime in its dreariness. There was not a tree within sight; there was
not, at this season, a green pasture nothing but fallow and turnips everywhere;
in large fields divided by hedges plashed to unrelieved levels.

<P>Tess waited outside the door of the farmhouse till the group of work-folk
had received their wages, and then Marian introduced her. The farmer himself,
it appeared, was not at home, but his wife, who represented him this evening,
made no objection to hiring Tess, on her agreeing to remain till Old Lady-Day.
Female field-labour was seldom offered now, and its cheapness made it profitable
for tasks which women could perform as readily as men.

<P>Having signed the agreement, there was nothing more for Tess to do at
present than to get a lodging, and she found one in the house at whose
gable-wall she had warmed herself. It was a poor subsistence that she had
ensured, but it would afford a shelter for the winter at any rate.

<P>That night she wrote to inform her parents of her new address, in case
a letter should arrive at Marlott from her husband. But she did not tell
them of the sorriness of her situation: it might have brought reproach
upon him.
