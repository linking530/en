Chapter 26</H1>
It was not till the evening, after family prayers, that Angel found opportunity
of broaching to his father one or two subjects near his heart. He had strung
himself up to the purpose while kneeling behind his brothers on the carpet,
studying the little nails in the heels of their walking boots. When the
service was over they went out of the room with their mother, and Mr Clare
and himself were left alone.

<P>The young man first discussed with the elder his plans for the attainment
of his position as a farmer on an extensive scale either in England or
in the Colonies. His father then told him that, as he had not been put
to the expense of sending Angel up to Cambridge, he had felt it his duty
to set by a sum of money every year towards the purchase or lease of land
for him some day, that he might not feel himself unduly slighted.

<P>`As far as worldly wealth goes,' continued his father, `you will no
doubt stand far superior to your brothers in a few years.'

<P>This considerateness on old Mr Clare's part led Angel onward to the
other and dearer subject. He observed to his father that he was then six-and-twenty,
and that when he should start in the farming business he would require
eyes in the back of his head to see to all matters - some one would be
necessary to superintend the domestic labours of his establishment whilst
he was afield. Would it not be well, therefore, for him to marry?

<P>His father seemed to think this idea not unreasonable; and then Angel
put the question--

<P>`What kind of wife do you think would be best for me as a thrifty hard-working
farmer?'

<P>`A truly Christian woman, who will be a help and a comfort to you in
your goings-out and your comings-in. Beyond that, it really matters little.
Such a one can be found; indeed, my earnest minded friend and neighbour,
Dr Chant--'

<P>`But ought she not primarily to be able to milk cows, churn good butter,
make immense cheeses; know how to sit hens and turkeys, and rear chickens,
to direct a field of labourers in an emergency, and estimate the value
of sheep and calves?'

<P>`Yes; a farmer's wife; yes, certainly. It would be desirable.' Mr Clare,
the elder, had plainly never thought of these points before. `I was going
to add,' he said, `that for a pure and saintly woman you will not find
more to your true advantage, and certainly not more to your mother's mind
and my own, than your friend Mercy, whom you used to show a certain interest
in. It is true that my neighbour Chant's daughter has lately caught up
the fashion of the younger clergy round about us for decorating the Communion-table
- altar, as I was shocked to hear her call it one day - with flowers and
other stuff on festival occasions. But her father, who is quite as opposed
to such flummery as I, says that can be cured. It is a mere girlish outbreak
which, I am sure, will not be permanent.'

<P>`Yes, yes; Mercy is good and devout, I know. But, father, don't you
think that a young woman equally pure and virtuous as Miss Chant, but one
who, in place of that lady's ecclesiastical accomplishments, understands
the duties of farm life as well as a farmer himself, would suit me infinitely
better?'

<P>His father persisted in his conviction that a knowledge of a farmer's
wife's duties came second to a Pauline view of humanity; and the impulsive
Angel, wishing to honour his father's feelings and to advance the cause
of his heart at the same time, grew specious. He said that fate or Providence
had thrown in his way a woman who possessed every qualification to be the
helpmate of an agriculturist, and was decidedly of a serious turn of mind.
He would not say whether or not she had attached herself to the sound Low
Church School of his father; but she would probably be open to conviction
on that point; she was a regular church-goer of simple faith; honest-hearted,
receptive, intelligent, graceful to a degree, chaste as a vestal, and,
in personal appearance, exceptionally beautiful.

<P>`Is she of a family such as you would care to marry into - a lady, in
short?' asked his startled mother, who had come softly into the study during
the conversation.

<P>`She is not what in common parlance is called a lady,' said Angel, unflinchingly,
`for she is a cottager's daughter, as I am proud to say. But she <I>is</I>
a lady, nevertheless - in feeling and nature.'

<P>`Mercy Chant is of a very good family.'

<P>`Pooh! - what's the advantage of that, mother?' said Angel quickly.
`How is family to avail the wife of a man who has to rough it as I have,
and shall have to do?'

<P>`Mercy is accomplished. And accomplishments have their charm,' returned
his mother, looking at him through her silver spectacles.

<P>`As to external accomplishments, what will be the use of them in the
life I am going to lead? - while as to her reading, I can take that in
hand. She'll be apt pupil enough, as you would say if you knew her. She's
brim full of poetry - actualized poetry, if I may use the expression. She
<I>lives#</I> what paper-poets only write... And she is an unimpeachable
Christian, I am sure; perhaps of the very tribe, genus, and species you
desire to propagate.'

<P>`O Angel, you are mocking!'

<P>`Mother, I beg pardon. But as she really does attend Church almost every
Sunday morning, and is a good Christian girl, I am sure you will tolerate
any social shortcomings for the sake of that quality, and feel that I may
do worse than choose her.' Angel waxed quite earnest on that rather automatic
orthodoxy in his beloved Tess which (never dreaming that it might stand
him in such good stead) he had been prone to slight when observing it practised
by her and the other milkmaids, because of its obvious unreality amid beliefs
essentially naturalistic.

<P>In their sad doubts as to whether their son had himself any right whatever
to the title he claimed for the unknown young woman, Mr and Mrs Clare began
to feel it as an advantage not to be overlooked that she at least was sound
in her views; especially as the conjunction of the pair must have arisen
by an act of Providence; for Angel never would have made orthodoxy a condition
of his choice. They said finally that it was better not to act in a hurry,
but that they would not object to see her.

<P>Angel therefore refrained from declaring more particulars now. He felt
that, single-minded and self-sacrificing as his parents were, there yet
existed certain latent prejudices of theirs, as middle-class people, which
it would require some tact to overcome. For though legally at liberty to
do as he chose, and though their daughter-in-law's qualifications could
make no practical difference to their lives, in the probability of her
living far away from them, he wished for affection's sake not to wound
their sentiment in the most important decision of his life.

<P>He observed his own inconsistencies in dwelling upon accidents in Tess's
life as if they were vital features. It was for herself that he loved Tess;
her soul, her heart, her substance - not for her skill in the dairy, her
aptness as his scholar, and certainly not for her simple formal faith-professions.
Her unsophisticated open-air existence required no varnish of conventionality
to make it palatable to him. He held that education had as yet but little
affected the beats of emotion and impulse on which domestic happiness depends.
It was probable that, in the lapse of ages, improved systems of moral and
intellectual training would appreciably, perhaps considerably, elevate
the involuntary and even the unconscious instincts of human nature; but
up to the present day culture, as far as he could see, might be said to
have affected only the mental epiderm of those lives which had been brought
under its influence. This belief was confirmed by his experience of women,
which, having latterly been extended from the cultivated middle-class into
the rural community, had taught him how much less was the intrinsic difference
between the good and wise woman of one social stratum and the good and
wise woman of another social stratum, than between the good and bad, the
wise and the foolish, of the same stratum or class.

<P>It was the morning of his departure. His brothers had already left the
vicarage to proceed on a walking tour in the north, whence one was to return
to his college, and the other to his curacy. Angel might have accompanied
them, but preferred to rejoin his sweetheart at Talbothays. He would have
been an awkward member of the party; for, though the most appreciative
humanist, the most ideal religionist, even the best-versed Christologist
of the three, there was alienation in the standing consciousness that his
squareness would not fit the round hole that had been prepared for him.
To neither Felix nor Cuthbert had he ventured to mention Tess.

<P>His mother made him sandwiches, and his father accompanied him, on his
own mare, a little way along the road. Having fairly well advanced his
own affairs Angel listened in a willing silence, as they jogged on together
through the shady lanes, to his father's account of his parish difficulties,
and the coldness of brother clergymen whom he loved, because of his strict
interpretations of the New Testament by the light of what they deemed a
pernicious Calvinistic doctrine.

<P>`Pernicious!' said Mr Clare, with genial scorn; and he proceeded to
recount experiences which would show the absurdity of that idea. He told
of wondrous conversions of evil livers of which he had been the instrument,
not only amongst the poor, but amongst the rich and well-to-do; and he
also candidly admitted many failures.

<P>As an instance of the latter, he mentioned the case of a young upstart
squire named d'Urberville, living some forty miles off, in the neighbourhood
of Trantridge.

<P>`Not one of the ancient d'Urbervilles of Kingsbere and other places?'
asked his son. `That curiously historic worn-out family with its ghostly
legend of the coach-and-four?'

<P>`O no. The original d'Urbervilles decayed and disappeared sixty or eighty
years ago - at least, I believe so. This seems to be a new family which
has taken the flame; for the credit of the former knightly line I hope
they are spurious, I'm sure. But it is odd to hear you express interest
in old families. I thought you set less store by them even than I.'

<P>`You misapprehend me, father; you often do,' said Angel with a little
impatience. `Politically I am sceptical as to the virtue of their being
old. Some of the wise even among themselves "exclaim against their own
succession", as Hamlet puts it; but lyrically, dramatically, and even historically,
I am tenderly attached to them.'

<P>This distinction, though by no means a subtle one, was yet too subtle
for Mr Clare the elder, and he went on with the story he had been about
to relate; which was that after the death of the senior so-called d'Urberville
the young man developed the most culpable passions, though he had a blind
mother, whose condition should have made him know better. A knowledge of
his career having come to the ears of Mr Clare, when he was in that part
of the country preaching missionary sermons, he boldly took occasion to
speak to the delinquent on his spiritual state. Though he was a stranger,
occupying another's pulpit, he had felt this to be his duty, and took for
his text the words from St Luke: `Thou fool, this night thy soul shall
be required of thee!' The young man much resented this directness of attack,
and in the war of words which followed when they met he did not scruple
publicly to insult Mr Clare, without respect for his gray hairs.

<P>Angel flushed with distress.

<P>`Dear father,' he said sadly, `I wish you would not expose yourself
to such gratuitous pain from scoundrels!'

<P>`Pain?' said his father, his rugged face shining in the ardour of self-abnegation.
`The only pain to me was pain on his account, poor, foolish young man.
Do you suppose his incensed words could give me any pain, or even his blows)
"Being reviled we bless; being persecuted we suffer it; being defamed we
entreat; we are made as the filth of the world, and as the off scouring
of all things unto this day." Those ancient and noble words to the Corinthians
are strictly true at this present hour.'

<P>`Not blows, father? He did not proceed to blows?'

<P>`No, he did not. Though I have borne blows from men in a mad state of
intoxication.'

<P>`No!'

<P>`A dozen times, my boy. What then? I have saved them from the guilt
of murdering their own flesh and blood thereby; and they have lived to
thank me, and praise God.'

<P>`May this young man do the same!' said Angel fervently. `But I fear
otherwise, from what you say.'

<P>`We'll hope, nevertheless,' said Mr Clare. `And I continue to pray for
him, though on this side of the grave we shall probably never meet again.
But, after all, one of those poor words of mine may spring up in his heart
as a good seed some day.'

<P>Now, as always, Clare's father was sanguine as a child; and though the
younger could not accept his parent's narrow dogma he revered his practice,
and recognized the hero under the pietist. Perhaps he revered his father's
practice even more now than ever, seeing that, in the question of making
Tessy his wife, his father had not once thought of inquiring whether she
were well provided or penniless. The same unworldliness was what had necessitated
Angel's getting a living as a farmer, and would probably keep his brothers
in the position of poor parsons for the term of their activities; yet Angel
admired it none the less. Indeed, despite his own heterodoxy, Angel often
felt that be was nearer to his father on the human side than was either
of his brethren.
