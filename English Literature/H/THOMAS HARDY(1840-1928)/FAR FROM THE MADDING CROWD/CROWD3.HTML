CHAPTER THREE</H1>

<H2>
A Girl on Horseback - Conversation</H2>
The sluggish day began to break. Even its position terrestrially is one
of the elements of a new interest, and for no particular reason save that
the incident of the night had occurred there Oak went again into the plantation.
Lingering and musing here he heard the steps of a horse at the foot of
the hill, and soon there appeared in view an auburn pony with a girl on
its back, ascending by the path leading past the cattle-shed. She was the
young woman of the night before. Gabriel instantly thought of the hat she
had mentioned as having lost in the wind; possibly she had come to look
for it. He hastily scanned the ditch, and after walking about ten yards
along it found the hat among the leaves. Gabriel took it in his hand and
returned to his hut. Here he ensconced himself, and peeped through the
loophole in the direction of the rider's approach.

<P>She came up and looked around - then on the other side of the hedge.
Gabriel was about to advance and restore the missing article, when an unexpected
performance induced him to suspend the action for the present. It was not
a bridle-path - merely a pedestrian's track, and the boughs spread horizontally
at a height not greater than seven feet above the ground, which made it
impossible to ride erect beneath them. The girl, who wore no riding-habit,
looked around for a moment, as if to assure herself that all humanity was
out of view, then dexterously dropped backwards flat upon the pony's back,
her head over its tail, her feet against its shoulders, and her eyes to
the sky. The rapidity of her glide into this position was that of a kingfisher
- its noiselessness that of a hawk. Gabriel's eyes had scarcely been able
to follow her. The tall lank pony seemed used to such doings, and ambled
along unconcerned. Thus she passed under the level boughs.

<P>The performer seemed quite at home anywhere between a horse's head and
its tail, and the necessity for this abnormal attitude having ceased with
the passage of the plantation, she began to adopt another, even more obviously
convenient than the first. She had no side-saddle, and it was vary apparent
that a firm seat upon the smooth leather beneath her was unattainable sideways.
Springing to her accustomed perpendicular like a bowed sapling, and satisfying
herself that nobody was in sight, she seated herself in the manner demanded
by the saddle, though hardly Bed of the woman, and trotted off in the direction
of Tewnell Mill.

<P>Oak was amused, perhaps a little astonished, and hanging up the hat
in his hut went again among his ewes. An hour passed, the girl returned,
properly seated now, with a bag of bran in front of her. On nearing the
cattle-shed she was met by a boy bringing a milking-pail, who held the
reins of the pony whilst she slid off. The boy led away the horse, leaving
the pail with the young woman.

<P>Soon soft spirits alternating with loud spirits came in regular succession
from within the shed, the obvious sounds of a person milking a cow. Gabriel
took the lost hat in his hand, and waited beside the path she would follow
in leaving the hill.

<P>She came, the pail in one hand, hanging against her knee. The left arm
was extended as a balance, enough of it being shown bare to make Oak wish
that the event had happened in the summer, when the whole would have been
revealed. There was a bright air and manner about her now, by which she
seemed to imply that the desirability of her existence could not be questioned;
and this rather saucy assumption filed in being offensive because a beholder
felt it to be, upon the whole, true. Like exceptional emphasis in the tone
of a genius, that which would have made mediocrity ridiculous was an addition
to recognized power. It was with some surprise that she saw Gabriel's lice
rising like the moon behind the hedge.

<P>The adjustment of the farmer's hazy conceptions of her charms to the
portrait of herself she now presented him with was less a diminution than
a difference. The starting-point selected by the judgement was her height.
She seemed tall, but the pail was a small one, and the hedge diminutive;
hence, making allowance for error by comparison with these, she could have
been not above the height to be chosen by women as best. All features of
consequence were severe and regular. It may have been observed by persons
who go about the shires with eyes for beauty that in Englishwomen a classically-formed
face is seldom found to be united with a figure of the same pattern, the
highly-finished features being generally too large for the remainder of
the frame; that a graceful and proportionate figure of eight heads usually
goes off into random facial curves without throwing a Nymphean tissue over
a milkmaid, let it be said that here criticism checked itself as out of
place, and looked at her proportions with a long consciousness of pleasure.
From the contours of her figure in its upper part she must have had a beautiful
neck and shoulders; but since her infancy nobody had ever seen them. Had
she been put into a low dress she would have run and thrust her head into
a bush. Yet she was not a shy girl by any means; it was merely her instinct
to draw the line dividing the seen from the unseen higher than they do
it in towns.

<P>That the girl's thoughts hovered about her face and form as soon as
she caught Oak's eyes conning the same page was natural, and almost certain.
The self-consciousness shown would have been vanity if a little more pronounced,
dignity if a little less. Rays of male vision seem to have a tickling effect
upon virgin faces in rural districts; she brushed hers with her hand, as
if Gabriel had been irritating its pink surface by actual touch, and the
free air of her previous movements was reduced at the same time to a chastened
phase of itself. Yet it was the man who blushed, the maid not at all.

<P>`I found a hat,' said Oak.

<P>`It is mine.' said she, and, from a sense of proportion, kept down to
a small smile an inclination to laugh distinctly: `it flew away last night.'

<P>`One o'clock this morning?'

<P>`All - it was.' She was surprised. `How did you know?' she said.

<P>`I was here.'

<P>`You are Farmer Oak, are you not?'

<P>`That or there abouts. I'm lately come to this place.'

<P>`A large farm?' she inquired, casting her eyes round, and swinging back
her hair, which was black in the shaded hollows of its mass; but it being
now an hour past sunrise the rays touched its prominent curves with a colour
of their own.

<P>`No; not large. About a hundred.' (In speaking of farms the word `acres'
is omitted by the natives, by analogy to such old expressions as `a stag
of ten'.)

<P>`I wanted my hat this morning,' she went on. `I had to ride to Tewnell
Mill.'

<P>`Yes, you had.'

<P>`How do you know?'

<P>`Where?' she inquired, a misgiving bringing every muscle of her lineaments
and frame to a standstill.

<P>`Here - going through the plantation, and all down the hill,' said Farmer
Oak, with an aspect excessively knowing with regard to some matter in his
mind, as he gazed at a remote point in the direction named, and then turned
back to meet his colloquist's eyes.

<P>A perception caused him to withdraw his own eyes from hers as suddenly
as if he had been caught in a theft. Recollection of the strange antics
she had indulged in when passing through the trees was succeeded in the
girl by a nettled palpitation, and that by a hot face. It was a time to
see a woman redden who was not given to reddening as a rule; not a point
in the milkmaid but was of the deepest rose-colour. From the Maiden's Blush,
through all varieties of the Provence down to the Crimson Tuscany the countenance
of Oak's acquaintance quickly graduated; whereupon he, in considerateness,
turned away his head.

<P>The sympathetic man still looked the other way, and wondered when she
would recover coolness sufficient to justify him in facing her again. He
heard what seemed to be the flitting of a dead leaf upon the breeze, and
looked. She had gone away.

<P>With an air between that of Tragedy and Comedy Gabriel returned to his
work.

<P>Five mornings and evenings passed. The young woman came regularly to
milk the healthy cow or to attend to the sick one, but never allowed her
vision to stray in the direction of Oak's person. His want of tact had
deeply offended her - not by seeing what he could not help, but by letting
her know that he had seen it. For, as without law there is no sin, without
eyes there' is no indecorum; and she appeared to feel that Gabriel's espial
had made her an indecorous woman without her own connivance. It was food
for great regret with him; it was also a <I>contretemps</I> which touched
into life a latent heat he had experienced in that direction.

<P>The acquaintanceship might, however, have ended in a slow forgetting
but for an incident which occurred at the end of the same week. One afternoon
it began to freeze, and the frost increased with evening, which drew on
like a stealthy tightening of bonds. It was a time when in cottages the
breath of the sleepers freezes to the sheets; when round the drawing-room
fire of a thick-walled mansion the sitters' backs are cold, even whilst
their faces are all aglow. Many a small bird went to bed supperless that
night among the bare boughs.

<P>As the milking-hour drew near Oak kept his usual watch upon the cowshed.
At last he felt cold, and shaking an extra quantity of bedding round the
yeaning ewes he entered the hut and heaped more fuel upon the stove. The
wind came in at the bottom of the door, and to prevent it Oak laid a sack
there and wheeled the cot round a little more to the south. Then the wind
spouted in at a ventilating hole of which there was one on each side of
the hut.

<P>Gabriel had always known that when the fire was lighted and the door
closed one of these must be kept open - that chosen being always on the
side away from the wind. Closing the slide to windward he turned to open
the other; on second thoughts the farmer considered that he would first
sit down, leaving both closed for a minute or two, till the temperature
of the hut was a little raised. He sat down.

<P>His head began to ache in an unwonted manner and, fancying himself weary
by reason of the broken rests of the preceding nights, Oak decided to get
up, open the slide, and then allow himself to All asleep. He fell asleep,
however, without having performed the necessary preliminary.

<P>How long he remained unconscious Gabriel never knew. During the first
stages of his return to perception peculiar deeds seemed to be in course
of enactment. His dog was howling, his head was aching fearfully - somebody
was pulling him about, hands were loosening his neckerchief.

<P>On opening his eyes he found that evening had sunk to dusk in a strange
manner of unexpectedness. The young girl with the remarkably pleasant lips
and white teeth was beside him. More than this - astonishingly more - his
head was upon her lap, his face and neck were disagreeably wet, and her
fingers were unbuttoning his collar.

<P>`Whatever is the matter?' said Oak vacantly.

<P>She seemed to experience mirth, but of too insignificant a kind to start
enjoyment.

<P>`Nothing now,' she answered, `since you are not dead. It is a wonder
you were not suffocated in this hut of yours.'

<P>`Ah, the hut!' murmured Gabriel. `I gave ten pounds for that hut. But
I'll sell it, and sit under thatched hurdles as they did in old times,
and curl up to sleep in a lock of straw! It played me nearly the same trick
the other day!' Gabriel, by way of emphasis, brought down his fist upon
the floor.

<P>`It was not exactly the fault of the hut,' she observed in a tone which
showed her to be that novelty among women - one who finished a thought
before beginning the sentence which was to convey it. `You should, I think,
have considered, and not have been so foolish as to leave the slides closed.'

<P>`Yes, I suppose I should,' said Oak absently. He was endeavouring to
catch and appreciate the sensation of being thus with her, his head upon
her dress, before the event passed on into the heap of bygone things. He
wished she knew his impressions; but he would as soon have thought of carrying
an odour in a net as of attempting to convey the intangibilities of his
feeling in the coarse meshes of language. So he remained silent.

<P>She made him sit up, and then Oak began wiping his face and shaking
himself like a Samson. `How can I thank 'ee?' he mid at last gratefully,
some of the natural, rusty red having returned to his face.

<P>`Oh, never mind that,' mid the girl, smiling, and allowing her smile
to hold good for Gabriel's next remark, whatever that might prove to be.

<P>`How did you find me?'

<P>`I heard your dog howling and scratching at the door of the hut when
I came to the milking (it was so lucky, Daisy's milking is almost over
for the season, and I shall not come here after this week or the next).
The dog saw me, and jumped over to me, and laid hold of my skirt. I came
across and looked round the hut the very first thing to see if the slides
were closed. My uncle has a hut like this one, and I have heard him tell
his shepherd not to go to sleep without leaving a slide open. I opened
the door, and there you were like dead. I threw the milk over you, as there
was no water, forgetting it was warm, and no use.'

<P>`I wonder if I should have died?' Gabriel said in a low voice, which
was rather meant to travel back to himself than to her.

<P>`O no!' the girl replied. She seemed to prefer a less tragic probability;
to have saved a man from death involved talk that should harmonize with
the dignity of such a deed - and she shunned it.

<P>`I believe you saved my Me, Miss - I don't know your name. I know your
aunt's, but not yours.

<P>`I would just as soon not tell it - rather not. There is no reason either
why I should, as you probably will never have much to do with me.'

<P>`Still I should like to know.'

<P>`You can inquire at my aunt's - she will tell you.'

<P>`My name is Gabriel Oak.'

<P>`And mine isn't. You seem fond of yours in speaking it so decisively,
Gabriel Oak.'

<P>`You see, it is the only one I shall ever have, and I must make the
most of it.'

<P>`I always think mine sounds odd and disagreeable.'

<P>`I should think you might soon get a new one.'

<P>`Mercy! - how many opinions you keep about you concerning other people,
Gabriel Oak.'

<P>`Well, Miss - excuse the words - I thought you would like them. But
I can't match you, I know, in mapping out my mind upon my tongue. I never
was very clever in my inside. But I thank you. Come, give me your hand!'

<P>She hesitated, somewhat disconcerted at Oak's old-fashioned earnest
conclusion to a dialogue lightly carried on. `Very well,' she said, and
gave him her hand, compressing her lips to a demure impassivity. He held
it but an instant, and in his fear of being too demonstrative, swerved
to the opposite extreme, touching her fingers with the lightness of a small-hearted
person.

<P>`I am sorry,' he said the instant after.

<P>`What for?'

<P>`Letting your hand go so quick.'

<P>`You may have it again if you like; there it is.' She gave him her hand
again.

<P>Oak held it longer this time - indeed, curiously long. `How soft it
is - being winter time, too - not chapped or rough, or anything!' he said.

<P>`There - that's long enough,' said she, though without pulling it away.
`But I suppose you are thinking you would like to kiss it? You may if you
want to.

<P>`I wasn't thinking of any such thing,' said Gabriel simply; `but I will--'

<P>`That you won't!' She snatched back her hand.

<P>Gabriel felt himself guilty of another want of tact.

<P>`Now find out my name,' she said teasingly; and withdrew.
