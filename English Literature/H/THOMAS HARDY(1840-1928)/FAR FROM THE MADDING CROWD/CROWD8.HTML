CHAPTER EIGHT</H1>

<H2>
The Malthouse - The Chat - News</H2>
Warren's Malthouse was enclosed by an old wall in wrapped with ivy, and
though not much of the exterior was visible at this hour, the character
and purposes of the building were clearly enough shown by its outline upon
the sky. From the walls an overhanging thatched roof sloped up to a point
in the centre, upon which rose a small wooden lantern, fitted with louvre-boards
on all the four sides, and from these openings a mist was dimly perceived
to be escaping into the night air. There was no window in front; but a
square hole in the door was glazed with a single pane, through which red,
comfortable rays now stretched out upon the ivied wall in front. Voices
were to be heard inside.

<P>Oak's hand skimmed the surface of the door with fingers extended to
an Elymas-the-Sorcerer pattern, till he found a leathern strap which he
pulled. This lifted a Wooden latch, and the door swung open.

<P>The room inside was lighted only by the ruddy glow from the kiln, mouth,
which shone over the floor with the streaming horizontality of the setting
sun, and threw upwards the shadows of all facial irregularities in those
assembled around. The stone-flag floor was worn into a path from the doorway
to the kiln, and into undulations everywhere. A curved settle of unplaned
oak stretched along one side, and in a remote corner was a small bed and
bedstead, the owner and frequent occupier of which was the maltster.

<P>This aged man was now sitting opposite the fire, his frosty white hair
and beard overgrowing his gnarled figure like the grey moss and lichen
upon a leafless apple tree. He wore breeches and the laced-up shoes called
ankle-jacks; he kept his eyes fixed upon the fire.

<P>Gabriel's nose was greeted by an atmosphere laden with the sweet smell
of new malt. The conversation (which seemed to have been concerning the
origin of the fire) immediately ceased, and every one ocularly criticized
him to the degree expressed by contracting the flesh of their foreheads
and looking at him with narrowed eyelids, as if he had been a light too
strong for their sight. Several exclaimed meditatively, after this operation
had been completed:--

<P>`Oh, 'tis the new shepherd, 'a b'lieve.'

<P>`We thought we heard a hand pawing about the door for the bobbin,' but
weren't sure 'twere not a dead leaf blowed across,' said another.

<P>`Come in, shepherd; sure ye be welcome, though we don't know yer name.'

<P>`Gabriel Oak, that's my name, neighbours.'

<P>The ancient maltster sitting in the midst turned at this - his turning
being as the turning of a rusty crane.

<P>`That's never Gable Oak's grandson over at Norcombe - never!' he said,
as a formula expressive of surprise, which nobody was supposed to take
literally.

<P>`My father and my grandfather were old men of the name of Gabriel,'
said the shepherd placidly.

<P>`Thought I knowed the man's face as I seed him on the rick! thought
I did! And where be ye trading o't to now, shepherd?'

<P>`I'm thinking of biding here,' said Mr Oak.

<P>`Knowed yer grandfather for years and years!' continued the maltster,
the words coming forth of their own accord as if the momentum previously
imparted had been sufficient.

<P>`Ah - and did you!'

<P>`Knowed yer grandmother.'

<P>`And her too!'

<P>`Likewise knowed yer father when he was a child. Why, my boy Jacob there
and your father were sworn brothers - that they were sure - weren't ye
Jacob?'

<P>`Ay, sure,' said his son, a young man about sixty-five, with a semi-bald
head and one tooth in the left centre of his upper jaw, which made much
of itself by standing prominent, like a milestone in a bank. `But 'twas
Joe had most to do with him. However, my son William must have knowed the
very man afore us - didn't ye, Billy, afore ye left Norcombe?'

<P>`No, 'twas Andrew,' said Jacob's son Billy, a child of forty, or thereabouts,
who manifested the peculiarity of possessing a cheerful soul in a gloomy
body, and whose whiskers were assuming a chinchilla shade here and there.

<P>`I can mind Andrew,' said Oak, `as being a man in the place when I was
quite a child.'

<P>`Ay - the other day I and my youngest daughter, Liddy, were over at
my grandson's christening,' continued Billy. `We were talking about this
very family, and 'twas only last Purification Day in this very world, when
the use-money is gied away to the second-best poor folk, you know, shepherd,
and I can mind the day because they all had to traypse up to the vestry
- yes, this very man's family.'

<P>`Come, shepherd, and drink. 'Tis gape and swaller with us - a drap of
sommit, but not of much account,' said the maltster, removing from the
fire his eyes, which were vermilion-red and bleared by gazing into it for
so many years. `Take up the God-forgive-me, Jacob. See if 'tis warm, Jacob.'

<P>Jacob stooped to the God-forgive-me, which was a two-handled tall mug
standing in the ashes, cracked and charred with heat: it was rather furred
with extraneous matter about the outside, especially in the crevices of
the handles, the innermost curves of which may not have seen daylight for
several years by reason of this encrustation thereon - formed of ashes
accidentally wetted with cider and baked hard; but to the mind of any sensible
drinker the cup was no worse for that, being incontestably clean on the
inside and about the rim. It may be observed that such a class of mug is
called a God-forgive-me in Weatherbury and its vicinity for uncertain reasons;
probably because its size makes any given toper feel ashamed of himself
when he sees its bottom in drinking it empty.

<P>Jacob, on receiving the order to see if the liquor was warm enough,
placidly dipped his forefinger into it by way of thermometer, and having
pronounced it nearly of the proper degree, raised the cup and very civilly
attempted to dust some of the ashes from the bottom with the skirt of his
smock-frock, because Shepherd Oak was a stranger.

<P>`A clane cup for the shepherd,' said the maltster commandingly.

<P>`No - not at all,' said Gabriel, in a reproving tone of considerateness.

<P>`I never fuss about dirt in its pure state, and when I know what sort
it is.' Taking the mug he drank an inch or more from the depth of its contents,
and duly passed it to the next man. `I wouldn't think of giving such trouble
to neighbours in washing up when there's so much work to be done in the
world already,' continued Oak in a moister tone, after recovering from
the stoppage of breath which is occasioned by pulls at large mugs.

<P>`A right sensible man,' said Jacob.

<P>`True, true; it can't be gainsaid!' observed a brisk young man - Mark
Clark by name, a genial and pleasant gentleman, whom to meet anywhere in
your travels was to know, to know was to drink with, and to drink with
was, unfortunately, to pay for.

<P>`And here's a mouthful of bread and bacon that mis'ess have sent, shepherd.
The cider will go down better with a bit of victuals. Don't ye chaw quite
close, shepherd, for I let the bacon fall in the road outside as I was
bringing it along, and may be 'tis rather gritty. There, 'tis clane dirt;
and we all know what that is, as you say, and you bain't a particular man
we see, shepherd.'

<P>`True, true - not at all,' said the friendly Oak.

<P>`Don't let your teeth quite meet, and you won't feel the sandiness at
all. Ah! 'tis wonderful what can be done by contrivance!'

<P>`My own mind exactly, neighbour.'

<P>`Ah, he's his grandfer's own grandson! - his grandfer were just such
a nice unparticular man!' said the maltster.

<P>`Drink, Henry Fray - drink,' magnanimously said Jan Coggan, a per son
who held Saint-Simonian notions of share and share alike where liquor was
concerned, as the vessel showed signs of approaching him in its gradual
revolution among them.

<P>Having at this moment reached the end of a wistful gaze into mid-air,
Henry did not refuse. He was a man of more than middle age, with eyebrows
high up in his forehead, who laid it down that the law of the world was
bad, with a long-suffering look through his listeners at the world alluded
to, as it presented itself to his imagination. He always signed his name
`Henery' - strenuously insisting upon that spelling, and if any passing
schoolmaster ventured to remark that the second `e' was superfluous and
old-fashioned, he received the reply that `H-e-n-e-r-y' was the name he
was christened and the name he would stick to in the tone of one to whom
orthographical differences were matters which had a great deal to do with
personal character.

<P>Mr Jan Coggan, who had passed the cup to Henery, was a crimson man with
a spacious countenance and private glimmer in his eye, whose name had appeared
on the marriage register of Weatherbury and neighbouring parishes as best
man and chief-witness in countless unions of the previous twenty years;
he also very frequently filled the post of head godfather in baptisms of
the subtly-jovial kind.

<P>`Come, Mark Clark - come. Ther's plenty more in the barrel,' said Jan.

<P>`Ay - that I will; 'tis my only doctor,' replied Mr Clark, who' twenty
years younger than Jan Coggan, revolved in the same orbit. He secreted
mirth on all occasions for special discharge at popular parties.

<P>`Why, Joseph Poorgrass, ye han't had a drop!' said Mr Coggan to a self-conscious
man in the background, thrusting the cup towards him.

<P>`Such a modest man as he is!' said Jacob Smallbury. `Why, ye've hardly
had strength of eye enough to look in our young mis'ess's face, so I hear,
Joseph?'

<P>All looked at Joseph Poorgrass with pitying reproach.

<P>`No - I've hardly looked at her at all,' simpered Joseph, reducing his
body smaller whilst talking, apparently from a meek sense of undue prominence.
`And when I seed her, 'twas nothing but blushes with me!'

<P>`Poor feller,' said Mr Clark.

<P>`'Tis a curious nature for a man,' said Jan Coggan.

<P>`Yes,' continued Joseph Poorgrass - his shyness, which was so painful
as a defect, filling him with a mild complacency now that it was regarded
as an interesting study. `'Twere blush, blush, blush with me every minute
of the time, when she was speaking to me.'

<P>`I believe ye, Joseph Poorgrass, for we all know ye to be a very bashful
man.'

<P>`'Tis a' awkward gift for a man, poor soul,' said the maltster. `And
ye have suffered from it a long time, we know.'

<P>`Ay, ever since I was a boy. Yes mother was concerned to her heart about
it - yes. But 'twas all nought.'

<P>`Did ye ever go into the world to try and stop it, Joseph Poorgrass?'

<P>`Oh ay, tried all sorts o' company. They took me to Greenhill Fair,
and into a great gay jerry-go-nimble show, where there were women-folk
riding round - standing upon horses, with hardly anything on but their
smocks; but it didn't cure me a morsel. And then I was put errand-man at
the Women's Skittle Alley at the back of the Tailor's Arms in Casterbridge.
'Twas a horrible sinal situation, and a very curious place for a good man.
I had to stand and look ba'dy people in the face from morning till night;
but 'twas no use - I was just as bad as ever after all. Blushes hev been
in the family for generations. There, 'tis a happy providence that I be
no worse.

<P>`True,' said Jacob Smallbury, deepening his thoughts to a profounder
view of the subject. `'Tis a thought to look at, that ye might have been
worse; but even as you be, 'tis a very bad affliction for 'ee, Joseph.
For ye see, shepherd, though 'tis very well for a woman, dang it all, 'tis
awkward for a man like him, poor feller?'

<P>`'Tis--'tis,' said Gabriel, recovering from a meditation. `Yes, very
awkward for the man.'

<P>`Ay, and he's very timid, too,' observed Jan Coggan. `Once he had been
working late at Yalbury Bottom, and had had a drap of drink, and lost his
way as he was coming home-along through Yalbury Wood, didn't ye, Master
Poorgrass?'

<P>`No, no, no; not that story!' expostulated the modest man, forcing a
laugh to bury his concern.

<P>` - And so 'a lost himself quite,' continued Mr Coggan, with an impassive
face, implying that a true narrative, like time and tide, must run its
course and would respect no man. `And as he was coming along in the middle
of the night, much afeared, and not able to find his way out of the trees
nohow, 'a cried out, "Man-a-lost! man-a-lost!" A owl in a tree happened
to be crying "Whoo-whoo-whoo!" as owls do' you know, shepherd' (Gabriel
nodded), `and Joseph, all in a tremble, said, "Joseph Poorgrass, of Weatherbury,
sir!"'

<P>`No, no, now - that's too much!' said the timid man, becoming a man
of brazen courage all of a sudden. `I didn't say <I>sir</I>. I'll take
my oath I didn't say "Joseph Poorgrass o' Weatherbury, sir." No, no; what's
right is right, and I never said sir to the bird, knowing very well that
no man of a gentleman's rank would be hollering there at that time o' night.
"Joseph Poorgrass of Weatherbury," - that's every word I said, and I shouldn't
ha' said that if't hadn't been for Keeper Day's metheglin... There, 'twas
a merciful thing it ended where it did.'

<P>The question of which was right being tacitly waived by the company,
Jan went on meditatively:--

<P>`And he's the fearfullest man, bain't ye, Joseph? Ay, another time ye
were lost by Lambing-Down Gate, weren't ye, Joseph?'

<P>`I was,' replied Poorgrass, as if there were some conditions too serious
even for modesty to remember itself under, this being one.

<P>`Yes; that were the middle of the night, too. The gate would not open,
try how he would, and knowing there was the Devil's hand in it, he kneeled
down.'

<P>`Ay,' said Joseph, acquiring confidence from the warmth of the fire,
the cider, and a perception of the narrative capabilities of the experience
alluded to. `My heart died within me, that time; but I kneeled down and
said the Lord's Prayer, and then the Belief right through, and then the
Ten Commandments, in earnest prayer. But no, the gate wouldn't open; and
then I went on with Dearly Beloved Brethren, and, thinks I, this makes
four, and 'tis all I know out of book, and if this don't do it nothing
will, and I'm a lost man. Well, when I got to Saying After Me, I rose from
my knees and found the gate would open - yes, neighbours, the gate opened
the same as ever.

<P>A meditation on the obvious inference was indulged in by all, and during
its continuance each directed his vision into the ashpit, which glowed
like a desert in the tropics under a vertical sun, shaping their eyes long
and liny, partly because of the light, partly from the depth of the subject
discussed.

<P>Gabriel broke the silence. `What sort of a place is this to live at,
and what sort of a mis'ess is she to work under?' Gabriel's bosom thrilled
gently as he thus slipped under the notice of the assembly the innermost
subject of his heart.

<P>`We d'know little of her - nothing. She only showed herself a few days
ago. Her uncle was took bad, and the doctor was called with his worldwide
skill; but he couldn't save the man. As I take it, she's going to keep
on the farm.'

<P>`That's about the shape o't, 'a b'lieve' said Jan Coggan. `Ay, 'tis
a very good family. I'd as soon be under 'em as under one here and there.
Her uncle was a very fair sort of man. Did ye know en, shepherd - a bachelor-man?'

<P>`Not at all.'

<P>`I used to go to his house a-courting my first wife, Charlotte, who
was his dairymaid. Well, a very good-hearted man were Farmer Everdene,
and I being a respectable young fellow was allowed to call and see her
and drink as much ale as I liked, but not to carry away any - outside my
skin I mane, of course.'

<P>`Ay, ay, Jan Coggan; we know yer maning.'

<P>`And so you see 'twas beautiful ale, and I wished to value his kindness
as much as I could, and not to be so ill-mannered as to drink only a thimbleful,
which would have been insulting the man's generosity--

<P>`True, Master Coggan, 'twould so,' corroborated Mark Clark.

<P>` - And so I used to eat a lot of salt fish afore going, and then by
the time I got there I were as dry as a lime-basket - so thorough dry that
that ale would slip down - ah, 'twould slip down sweet! Happy times! heavenly
times! Such lovely drunks as I used to have at that house! You can mind,
Jacob? You used to go wi' me sometimes.'

<P>`I can - I can,' said Jacob. `That one, too, that we had at Buck's Head
on a White Monday was a pretty tipple.'

<P>`'Twas. But for a wet of the better class, that brought you no nearer
to the horned man than you were afore you begun, there was none like those
in Farmer Everdene's kitchen. Not a single damn allowed; no, not a bare
poor one, even at the most cheerful moment when all were blindest, though
the good old word of sin thrown in here and there at such times is a great
relief to a merry soul.'

<P>`True,' said the maltster. `Nater requires her swearing at the regular
times, or she's not herself; and unholy exclamations is a necessity of
life.'

<P>`But Charlotte,' continued Coggan - `not a word of the sort would Charlotte
allow, nor the smallest item of taking in vain... Ay, poor Charlotte, I
wonder if she had the good fortune to get into Heaven when 'a died! But
'a was never much in luck's way and perhaps 'a went downwards after all,
poor soul.'

<P>`And did any of you know Miss Everdene's father and mother?' inquired
the shepherd, who found some difficulty in keeping the conversation in
the desired channel.

<P>`I knew them a little,' said Jacob Smallbury; `but they were townsfolk,
and didn't live here. They've been dead for years. Father, what sort of
people were mis'ess' father and mother?'

<P>`Well,' said the maltster, `he wasn't much to look at; but she was a
lovely woman. He was fond enough of her as his sweetheart.'

<P>`Used to kiss her scores and long-hundreds o' times, so `twas said,'
observed Coggan.

<P>`He was very proud of her, too, when they were married, as I've been
told,' said the maltster.

<P>`Ay,' said Coggan. `He admired her so much that he used to light the
candle three times a night to look at her.

<P>`Boundless love; I shouldn't have supposed it in the universe!' murmured
Joseph Poorgrass, who habitually sake on a large scale in his moral reflections.

<P>`Well, to be sure,' said Gabriel.

<P>`Oh, 'tis true enough. I knowed the man and woman both well. Levi Everdene
- that was the man's name, sure. "Man," saith I in my hurry, but he were
of a higher circle of life than that - `a was a gentleman-tailor really,
worth scores of pounds. And he became a very celebrated bankrupt two or
three times.'

<P>`Oh, I thought he was quite a common man!' said Joseph.

<P>`O no, no! That man failed for heaps of money; hundreds in gold and
silver.'

<P>The maltster being rather short of breath, Mr Coggan, after absently
scrutinizing a coal which had fallen among the ashes, took up the narrative,
with a private twirl of his eye:

<P>`Well, now, you'd hardly believe it, but that man - our Miss Everdene's
father - was one of the ficklest husbands alive, after a while. Understand,
'a didn't want to be fickle, but he couldn't help it. The poor feller were
faithful and true enough to her in his wish, but his heart would rove,
do what he would. He spoke to me in real tribulation about it once. "Coggan,"
he said, "I could never wish for a handsomer woman than I've got, but feeling
she's ticketed as my lawful wife, I can't help my wicked heart wandering,
do what I will." But at last I believe he cured it by making her take off
her wedding-ring and calling her by her maiden name as they sat together
after the shop was shut, and so 'a would get to fancy she was only his
sweetheart, and not married to him at all. And as soon as he could thoroughly
fancy he was doing wrong and committing the seventh `a got to like her
as well as ever, and they lived on a perfect picture of mutel love.

<P>`Well, 'twas a most ungodly remedy,' murmured Joseph Poorgrass; `but
we ought to feel deep cheerfulness that a happy Providence kept it from
being any worse. You see, he might have gone the bad road and given his
eyes to unlawfulness entirely - yes, gross unlawfulness, so to say it.'

<P>`You see,' said Billy Smallbury, `the man's will was to do right, sure
enough, but his heart didn't chime in.'

<P>`He got so much better that he was quite godly in his later years, wasn't
he, Jan?' said Joseph Poorgrass. ` - He got himself confirmed over again
in a more serious way, and took to saying "Amen" almost as loud as the
clerk, and he liked to copy comforting verses from the tombstones. He used,
too, to hold the money-plate at Let Your Light so Shine, and stand godfather
to poor little come-by-chance children; and he kept a missionary box upon
his table to nab folks unawares when they called; yes, and he would box
the charity-boys' ears, if they laughed in church, till they could hardly
stand upright, and do other deeds of piety natural to the saintly inclined.'

<P>`Ay, at that time he thought of nothing but high things,' added Billy
Smallbury. `One day Parson Thirdly met him and said, "Good morning, Mister
Everdene; 'tis a fine day!" "Amen," said Everdene, quite absent-like, thinking
only of religion when he seed a parson. Yes, he was a very Christian man.'

<P>`Their daughter was not at all a pretty chief at that time,' said Henery
Fray. `Never should have thought she'd have growed up such a handsome body
as she is.'

<P>`'Tis to be hoped her temper is as good as her face.'

<P>`Well, yes; but the baily will have most to do with the business and
ourselves. Ah!' Henery gazed into the ashpit, and smiled volumes of ironical
knowledge.

<P>`A queer Christian, like the Devil's head in a cow,' as the saying is,'
volunteered Mark Clark.

<P>`He is,' said Henery, implying that irony must cease at a certain point.
`Between we two' man and man, I believe that man would as soon tell a lie
Sundays as working-days - that I do so.'

<P>`Good faith, you do talk!' said Gabriel.

<P>`True enough,' said the man of bitter moods, looking round upon the
company with the antithetic laughter that comes from a keener appreciation
of the miseries of life than ordinary men are capable of. `Ah, there's
people of one sort, and people of another, but that man - bless your souls!'

<P>Gabriel thought fit to change the subject. `You must be a very aged
man, malter, to have sons growed up so old and ancient,' he remarked.

<P>`Father's so old that 'a can't mind his age, can ye, father?' interposed
Jacob. `And he's growed terrible crooked, too, lately,' Jacob continued,
surveying his lither's fire, which was rather more bowed than his own.
`Really, one may say that father there is three-double.'

<P>`Crooked folk will last a long while,' said the maltster, grimly, and
not in the best humour.

<P>`Shepherd would like to hear the pedigree of yer life, father - wouldn't
ye, shepherd?'

<P>`Ay, that I should,' said Gabriel, with the heartiness of a man who
had longed to hear it for several months. `What may your age be, malter?'

<P>The maltster cleared his throat in an exaggerated form for emphasis,
and elongating his gaze to the remotest point of the ashpit, said, in the
slow speech justifiable when the importance of a subject is so generally
felt that any mannerism must be tolerated in getting at it, `Well, I don't
mind the year I were born in, but perhaps I can reckon up the places I've
lived at, and so get it that way. I bode at Upper Longpuddle across there'
(nodding to the north) `till I were eleven. I bode seven at Kingsbere'
(nodding to the east) `where I took to malting. I went therefrom to Norcombe,
and malted there two-and-twenty years, and two-and-twenty years I was there
turnip-hoeing and harvesting. Ah, I knowed that old place, Norcombe, years
afore you were thought of, Master Oak' (Oak smiled sincere belief in the
fact). `Then I malted at Durnover four year, and four year turnip-hoeing;
and I was fourteen times eleven months at Millpond St Jude's' (nodding
north-west-by-north). `Old Twills wouldn't hire me for more than eleven
months at a time, to keep me from being chargeable to the parish if so
be I was disabled. Then I was three year at Mellstock, and I've been here
one-and-thirty year come Candlemas. How much is that?'

<P>`Hundred and seventeen,' chuckled another old gentleman, given to mental
arithmetic and little conversation, who had hitherto sat unobserved in
a corner.

<P>`Well, then, that's my age,' said the maltster emphatically.

<P>`O no, father!' said Jacob. `Your turnip-hoeing were in the summer and
your malting in the winter of the same years, and ye don't ought to count
both halves, father.'

<P>`Chok' it all! I lived through the summers, didn't I? That's my question.
I suppose ye'll say next I be no age at all to speak of?'

<P>`Sure we shan't,' said Gabriel soothingly.

<P>`Ye be a very old aged person, malter,' attested Jan Coggan, also soothingly.
`We all know that, and ye must have a wonderful talented constitution to
be able to live so long, mustn't he, neighbours?'

<P>`True, true; ye must, malter, wonderful'; said the meeting unanimously.

<P>The maltster, being now pacified, was even generous enough to voluntarily
disparage in a slight degree the virtue of having lived a great many years,
by mentioning that the cup they were drinking out of was three years older
than he.

<P>While the cup was being examined, the end of Gabriel Oak's flute became
visible over his smock-frock pocket, and Henery Fray exclaimed, `Surely,
shepherd, I seed you blowing into a great flute by now at Casterbridge?'

<P>`You did,' said Gabriel, blushing faintly. `I've been in great trouble,
neighbours, and was driven to it. I used not to be so poor as I be now.'

<P>`Never mind, heart!' said Mark Clark. `You should take it carelesslike,
shepherd, and your time will come. But we could thank ye for a tune, if
ye bain't too tired?'

<P>`Neither drum nor trumpet have I heard since Christmas,' said Jan Coggan.
`Come, raise a tune, Master Oak!'

<P>`That I will,' said Gabriel, pulling out his flute and putting it together.
`A poor tool, neighbours; but such as I can do ye shall have and welcome.'

<P>Oak then struck up `Jockey to the Fair', and played that sparkling melody
three times through, ascending the notes in the third round in a most artistic
and lively manner by bending his body in small jerks and tapping with his
foot to beat time.

<P>`He can blow the flute very well - that 'a can,' said a young married
man, who having no individuality worth mentioning was known as `Susan Tall's
husband'. He continued, `I'd as lief as not be able to blow into a flute
as well as that.'

<P>`He's a clever man, and 'tis a true comfort for us to have such a shepherd,'
murmured Joseph Poorgrass, in a soft cadence. `We ought to feel fill o'
thanksgiving that he's not a player of ba'dy songs instead of these merry
tunes; for 'twould have been just as easy for God to have made the shepherd
a loose low man - a man of iniquity, so to speak it - as what he is. Yes,
for our wives' and daughters' sakes we should feel real thanksgiving.'

<P>`True, true - real thanksgiving!' dashed in Mark Clark conclusively,
not feeling it to be of any consequence to his opinion that he had only
heard about a word and three-quarters of what Joseph had said.

<P>`Yes,' added Joseph, beginning to feel like a man in the Bible; `for
evil do thrive so in these times that ye may be as much deceived in the
clanest shaved and whitest shirted man as in the raggedest tramp upon the
turnpike, if I may term it so.'

<P>`Ay, I can mind yer face now, shepherd,' said Henery Fray, criticizing
Gabriel with misty eyes as he entered upon his second tune. `Yes - now
I see 'ee blowing into the flute I know 'ee to be the same man I see play
at Casterbridge, for yer mouth were scrimped up and yer eyes a staring
out like a strangled man's - just as they be now.'

<P>`'Tis a pity that playing the flute should make a man look such a scarecrow,
observed Mr Mark Clark, with additional criticism of Gabriel's countenance,
the latter person jerking out, with the ghastly grimace required by the
instrument, the chorus of `Dame Durden':--
<BLOCKQUOTE>`Twas Moll' and Bet', and Doll' and Kate',
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And Dorothy Drag'-gle Tail'.</BLOCKQUOTE>
`I hope you don't mind that young man's bad manners in naming your features?'
whispered Joseph to Gabriel.

<P>`Not at all,' said Mr Oak.

<P>`For by nature ye be a very handsome man, shepherd,' continued Joseph
Poorgrass with winning suavity.

<P>`Ay, that ye be, shepherd,' said the company.

<P>`Thank you very much,' said Oak, in the modest tone good manners demanded,
thinking, however, that he would never let Bathsheba see him playing the
flute; in this resolve showing a discretion equal to that related of its
sagacious inventress, the divine Minerva herself.

<P>`Ah, when I and my wife were married at Norcombe Church,' said the old
maltster, not pleased at finding himself left out of the subject, `we were
called the handsomest couple in the neighbourhood everybody said so.'

<P>`Danged if ye bain't altered now, malter,' said a voice with the vigour
natural to the enunciation of a remarkable evident truism. It came from
the old man in the background, whose offensiveness and spiteful ways were
barely atoned for by the occasional chuckle he contributed to general laughs.

<P>`O no, no,' said Gabriel.

<P>`Don't ye play no more, shepherd,' said Susan Tall's husband, the young
married man who had spoken once before. `I must be moving, and when there's
tunes going on I seem as if hung in wires. If I thought after I'd left
that music was still playing, and I not there, I should be quite melancholy-like.'

<P>`What's yer hurry then, Laban?' inquired Coggan. `You used to bide as
late as the latest.'

<P>`Well, ye see, neighbours, I was lately married to a woman, and she's
my vocation now, and so ye see--' The young man halted lamely.

<P>`New lords new laws, as the saying is, I suppose,' remarked Coggan.
`Ay, 'a b'lieve - ha, ha!' said Susan Tall's husband, in a tone intended
to imply his habitual reception of jokes without minding them at all. The
young man then wished them good-night and withdrew.

<P>Henery Fray was the first to follow. Then Gabriel arose and went off
with Jan Coggan, who had offered him a lodging. A few minutes later, when
the remaining ones were on their legs and about to depart, Fray came back
again in a hurry. Flourishing his finger ominously he threw a gaze teeming
with tidings just where his eye alighted by accident, which happened to
be in Joseph Poorgrass's face.

<P>`O - what's the matter, what's the matter, Henery?' said Joseph, starting
back.

<P>`What's a-brewing, Henery?' asked Jacob and Mark Clark. `Baily Pennyways
- Baily Pennyways - I said so; yes, I said so!'

<P>`What, found out stealing anything?'

<P>`Stealing it is. The news is, that after Miss Everdene got home she
went out again to see all was safe, as she usually do, and corning in found
Baily Pennyways creeping down the granary steps with half a bushel of barley.
She fleed at him like a cat - never such a tomboy as she is - of course
I speak with closed doors?'

<P>`You do - you do, Henery.'

<P>`She fleed at him, and, to cut a long story short, he owned to having
carried off five sack altogether, upon her promising not to persecute him.
Well, he's turned out neck and crop, and my question is, who's going to
be baily now?'

<P>The question was such a profound one that Henery was obliged to drink
there and then from the large cup till the bottom was distinctly visible
inside. Before he had replaced it on the table, in came the young man,
Susan Tall's husband, in a still greater hurry.

<P>`Have ye heard the news that's all over parish?'

<P>`About Baily Pennyways?'

<P>`But besides that?'

<P>`No - not a morsel of it!' they replied, looking into the very midst
of Laban Tall as if to meet his words halfway down his throat.

<P>`What a night of horrors!' murmured Joseph Poorgrass, waving his hands
spasmodically. `I've had the news-bell ringing in my left ear quite bad
enough for a murder, and I've seen a magpie all alone!'

<P>`Fanny Robin - Miss Everdene's youngest servant - can't be found. They've
been wanting to lock up the door these two hours, but she isn't come in.
And they don't know what to do about going to bed for fear of locking her
out. They wouldn't be so concerned if she hadn't been noticed in such low
spirits these last few days, and Maryann d' think the beginning of a crowner's
inquest has happened to the poor girl.'

<P>`O--'tis burned - 'tis burned!' came from Joseph Poorgrass's dry lips.

<P>`No--'tis drowned!' said Tall.

<P>`Or 'tis her father's razor!' suggested Billy Smallbury with a vivid
sense of detail.

<P>`Well - Miss Everdene wants to speak to one or two of us before we go
to bed. What with this trouble about the baily, and now about the girl,
mis'ess is almost wild.'

<P>They all hastened up the lane to the farmhouse, excepting the old maltster,
whom neither news, fire, rain, nor thunder could draw from his hole. There,
as the others' footsteps died away, he sat down again, and continued gazing
as usual into the furnace with his red, bleared eyes.

<P>From the bedroom window above their heads Bathsheba's head and shoulders,
robed in mystic white, were dimly seen extended into the air. `Are any
of my men among you?' she said anxiously. `Yes, ma'am, several,' said Susan
Tall's husband.

<P>`Tomorrow morning I wish two or three of you to make inquiries in the
villages round if they have seen such a person as Fanny Robin. Do it quietly;
there is no reason for alarm as yet. She must have left whilst we were
all at the fire.'

<P>`I beg yer pardon, but had she any young man courting her in the parish,
ma'am?' asked Jacob Smallbury.

<P>`I don't know,' said Bathsheba.

<P>`I've never heard of any such thing, ma'am,' said two or three.

<P>`It is hardly likely, either,' continued Bathsheba. `For any lover of
hers might have come to the house if he had been a respectable lad. The
most mysterious matter connected with her absence - indeed, the only thing
which gives me serious alarm - is that she was seen to go out of the house
by Maryann with only her indoor working gown on - not even a bonnet.'

<P>`And you mean, ma'am, excusing my words, that a young woman would hardly
go to see her young man without dressing up,' said Jacob, turning his mental
vision upon past experiences. `That's true - she would not, ma'am.'

<P>`She had, I think, a bundle, though I couldn't see very well,' said
a female voice from another window, which seemed that of Maryann. `But
she had no young man about here. Hers lives in Casterbridge, and I believe
he's a soldier.'

<P>`Do you know his name?' Bathsheba said.

<P>`No, mistress; she was very close about it.'

<P>`Perhaps I might be able to find out if I went to Casterbridge barracks,'
said William Smallbury.

<P>`Very well; if she doesn't return tomorrow, mind you go there and try
to discover which man it is, and see him. I feel more responsible than
I should if she had had any friends or relations alive. I do hope she has
come to no harm through a man of that kind. And then there's this disgraceful
affair of the bailiff - but I can't speak of him now.'

<P>Bathsheba had so many reasons for uneasiness that it seemed she did
not think it worth while to dwell upon any particular one. `Do as I told
you, then,' she said in conclusion, closing the casement.

<P>`Ay, ay, mistress; we will,' they replied, and moved away.

<P>That night at Coggan's Gabriel Oak, beneath the screen of closed eyelids,
was busy with fancies, and fill of movement, like a river flowing rapidly
under its ice. Night had always been the time at which he saw Bathsheba
most vividly, and through the slow hours of shadow he tenderly regarded
her image now. It is rarely that the pleasures of the imagination will
compensate for the pain of sleeplessness, hut they possibly did with Oak
to-night, for the delight of merely seeing her effaced for the time his
perception of the great difference between seeing and possessing.

<P>He also thought of plans for fetching his few utensils and books from
Norcombe. <I>The Young Man's Best Companion The Farriers Sure Guide, The
Veterinary Surgeon, Paradise Lost, The Pilgrims Progress, Robinson Crusoe,
Ash's Dictionary</I>, and Walkingame's <I>Arithmetic</I>, constituted his
library; and though a limited series, it was one from which he had acquired
more sound information by diligent perusal than many a man of opportunities
has done from a furlong of laden shelves.
