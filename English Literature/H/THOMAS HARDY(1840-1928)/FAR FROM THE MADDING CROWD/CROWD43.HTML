CHAPTER FORTY-THREE</H1>

<H2>
Fanny's Revenge</H2>
`Do you want me any longer, ma'am?' inquired Liddy, at a later hour the
same evening, standing by the door with a chamber candlestick in her hand,
and addressing Bathsheba, who sat cheerless and alone in the large parlour
beside the first fire of the seas on.

<P>`No more to-night, Liddy.'

<P>`I'll sit up for master if you like, ma'am. I am not at all afraid of
Fanny, if I may sit in my own room and have a candle. She was such a childlike,
fresh young thing that her spirit couldn't appear to anybody if it tried,
I'm quite sure.'

<P>`O no, no! You go to bed. I'll sit up for him myself till twelve o'clock,
and if he has not arrived by that time, I shall give him up and go to bed
too.'

<P>`It is half-past ten now.'

<P>`Oh: is it?'

<P>`Why don't you sit upstairs, ma'am?'

<P>`Why don't I?' said Bathsheba desultorily. `It isn't worth while - there's
a fire here, Liddy.' She suddenly exclaimed in an impulsive and excited
whisper, `Have you heard anything strange said of Fanny?' The words had
no sooner escaped her than an expres sion of unutterable regret crossed
her face, and she burst into tears.

<P>`No - not a word!' said Liddy, looking at the weeping woman with astonishment.
`What is it makes you cry so, ma'am; has anything hurt you?' She came to
Bathsheba's side with a face hill of sympathy.

<P>`No, Liddy - I don't want you any more. I can hardly say why I have
taken so to crying lately: I never used to cry. Good-night.'

<P>Liddy then left the parlour and closed the door.

<P>Bathsheba was lonely and miserable now; not lonelier actually than she
had been before her marriage; but her loneliness then was to that of the
present time as the solitude of a mountain is to the solitude of a cave.
And within the last day or two had com e these disquieting thoughts about
her husband's past. Her wayward sentiment that evening concerning Fanny's
temporary resting-place had been the result of a strange complication of
impulses in Bathsheba's bosom. Perhaps it would be more accurately descri
bed as a determined rebellion against her prejudices, a revulsion from
a lower instinct of uncharitableness, which would have withheld all sympathy
from the dead woman, because in life she had preceded Bathsheba in the
attentions of a man whom Bathsheba h ad by no means ceased from loving,
though her love was sick to death just now with the gravity of a further
misgiving.

<P>In five or ten minutes there was another tap at the door. Liddy reappeared,
and coming in a little way stood hesitating, until at length she said,
`Maryann has just heard something very strange, but I know it isn't true.
And we shall be sure to know the r ights of it in a day or two.'

<P>`What is it?'

<P>`Oh, nothing connected with you or us, ma'am. It is 'bout Fanny. That
same thing you have heard.'

<P>`I have heard nothing.'

<P>`I mean that a wicked story is got to Weatherbury within this last hour
- that------' Liddy came close to her mistress and whispered the remainder
of the sentence slowly into her ear, inclining her head as she spoke in
the direction of the room where Fann y lay.

<P>Bathsheba trembled from head to foot.

<P>`I don't believe it!' she said excitedly `And there's only one name
written on the coffin-cover.'

<P>`Nor I, ma'am. And a good many others don't; for we should surely have
been told more about it if it had been true - don't you think so' ma'am?'

<P>`We might or we might not.'

<P>Bathsheba turned and looked into the fire, that Liddy might not see
her face. Finding that her mistress was going to say no more, Liddy glided
out, closed the door softly, and went to bed.

<P>Bathsheba's face, as she continued looking into the fire that evening,
might have cited solicitousness on her account even among those who loved
her least. The sadness of Fanny Robin's fate did not make Bathsheba's glorious,
although she was the Esther to this poor Vashti, and their fates might
be supposed to stand in some respects as contrasts to each other. When
Liddy came into the room a second time the beautiful eyes which met hers
had worn a listless, weary look. When she went out after telling the s
tory they had pressed wretchedness in fill activity. Her simple country
nature, fed on old-fashioned principles, was troubled by that which would
have troubled a woman of the world very little, both Fanny and her child,
if she had one, being dead.

<P>Bathsheba had grounds for conjecturing a connection between her own
history and the dimly suspected tragedy of Fanny's end which Oak and Boldwood
never for a moment credited her with possessing. The meeting with the lonely
woman on the previous Saturday n ight had been unwitnessed and unspoken
of. Oak may have had the best of intentions in withholding for as many
days as possible the details of what had happened to Fanny; but had he
known that Bathsheba's perceptions had already been exercised in the matte
r, he would have done nothing to lengthen the minutes of suspense she was
now undergoing, when the certainty which must terminate it would be the
worst fact suspected after all.

<P>She suddenly felt a longing to speak to some one stronger than herself,
and so get strength to sustain her surmised position with dignity and her
carking doubts with stoicism. Where could she find such a friend? nowhere
in the house. She was by far the co olest of the women under her roof.
Patience and suspension of judgement for a few hours were what she wanted
to learn, and there was nobody to teach her. Might she but go to Gabriel
Oak! - but that could not be. What a way Oak had, she thought, of endurin
g things. Boldwood, who seemed so much deeper and higher and stronger in
feeling than Gabriel, had not yet learnt, any more than she herself, the
simple lesson which Oak showed a mastery of by every turn and look he gave
- that among the multitude of inte rests by which he was surrounded, those
which affected his personal wellbeing were not the most absorbing and important
in his eyes. Oak meditatively looked upon the horizon of circumstances
without any special regard to his own standpoint in the midst. T hat was
how she would wish to be. But then Oak was not racked by incertitude upon
the inmost matter of his bosom, as she was at this moment. Oak knew all
about Fanny that she wished to know - she felt convinced of that. If she
were to go to him now at onc e and say no more than these few words, `What
is the truth of the story?' he would feel bound in honour to tell her.
It would be an inexpressible relief. No further speech would need to be
uttered. He knew her so well that no eccentricity of behaviour in her would
alarm him.

<P>She flung a cloak round her, went to the door and opened it. Every blade,
every twig was still. The air was yet thick with moisture, though somewhat
less dense than during the afternoon, and a steady smack of drops upon
the fallen leaves under the boughs was almost musical in its soothing regularity.
It seemed better to be out of the house than within it, and Bathsheba closed
the door, and walked slowly down the lane till she came opposite to Gabriel's
cottage, where he now lived alone, having left Coggan 's house through
being pinched for room. There was a light in one window only, and that
was downstairs. The shutters were not closed, nor was any blind or curtain
drawn over the window, neither robbery nor observation being a contingency
which could do mu ch injury to the occupant of the domicile. Yes, it was
Gabriel himself who was sitting up; he was reading. From her standing-place
in the road she could see him plainly, sitting quite still, his light curly
head upon his hand, and only occasionally lookin g up to snuff the candle
which stood beside him. At length he looked at the clock, seemed surprised
at the lateness of the hour, closed his book, and arose. He was going to
bed, she knew, and if she tapped it must be done at once.

<P>Alas for her resolve! She felt she could not do it. Not for worlds now
could she give a hint about her misery to him, much less ask him plainly
for information on the cause of Fanny's death. She must suspect, and guess,
and chafe, and bear it all alone.

<P>Like a homeless wanderer she lingered by the bank, as if lulled and
fascinated by the atmosphere of content which seemed to spread from that
little dwelling, and was so sadly lacking in her own. Gabriel appeared
in an upper room, placed his light in the w indow-bench, and then - knelt
down to pray. The contrast of the picture with her rebellious and agitated
existence at this same time was too much for her to bear to look upon longer.
It was not for her to make a truce with trouble by any such means. She
m ust tread her giddy distracting measure to its last note, as she had
begun it. With a swollen heart she went again up the lane, and entered
her own door.

<P>More fevered now by a reaction from the first feelings which Oak's example
had raised in her, she paused in the hall, looking at the door of the room
wherein Fanny lay. She locked her fingers, threw back her head, and strained
her hot hands rigidly across her forehead, saying, with a hysterical sob,
`Would to God you would speak and tell me your secret, Fanny!... O, I hope
it is not true that there are two of you!... If I could only look in upon
you for one little minute, I should know all!'

<P>A few moments passed, and she added, slowly, `<I>And I will</I>.'

<P>Bathsheba in after times could never gauge the mood which carried her
through the actions following this murmured resolution on this memorable
evening of her life. She went to the lumber-closet for a screwdriver. At
the end of a short though undefined tim e she found herself in the small
room, quivering with emotion, a mist before her eyes, and an excruciating
pulsation in her brain, standing beside the uncovered coffin of the girl
whose conjectured end had so entirely engrossed her, and saying to herself
in a husky voice as she gazed within--

<P>`It was best to know the worst, and I know it now!'

<P>She was conscious of having brought about this situation by a series
of actions done as by one in an extravagant dream; of following that idea
as to method, which had burst upon her in the hall with glaring obviousness,
by gliding to the top of the stairs , assuring herself by listening to
the heavy breathing of her maids that they were asleep, gliding down again,
turning the handle of the door within which the young girl lay, and deliberately
setting herself to do what, if she had anticipated any such und ertaking
at night and alone, would have horrified her, but which, when done, was
not so dreadful as was the conclusive proof of her husband's conduct which
came with knowing beyond doubt the last chapter of Fanny's story.

<P>Bathsheba's head sank upon her bosom, and the breath which had been
bated in suspense, curiosity, and interest, was exhaled now in the form
of a whispered wail: `Oh-h-h!' she said, and the silent room added length
to her moan.

<P>Her tears fell fast beside the unconscious pair in the coffin; tears
of a complicated origin, of a nature indescribable, almost indefinable
except as other than those of simple sorrow. Assuredly their wonted fires
must have lived in Fanny's ashes when eve nts were so shaped as to chariot
her hither in this natural, unobtrusive, yet effectual manner. The one
feat alone - that of dying - by which a mean condition could be resolved
into a grand one, Fanny had achieved And to that had destiny subjoined
this re ncounter tonight, which hid, in Bathsheba's wild imagining, turned
her companion's failure to success, her humiliation to triumph, her lucklessness
to ascendency; it had thrown over herself a garish light of mockery, and
set upon all things about her an i ronical smile.

<P>Fanny's face was framed in by that yellow hair of hers; and there was
no longer much room for doubt as to the origin of the curl owned by Troy.
In Bathsheba's heated fancy the innocent white countenance-pressed a dim
triumphant consciousness of the pain s he was retaliating for her pain
with all the merciless rigour of the Mosaic law; `Burning for burning;
wound for wound; strife for strife.'

<P>Bathsheba indulged in contemplation of escape from her position by immediate
death, which, thought she, though it was an inconvenient and awful way,
had limits to its inconvenience and awfulness that could not be overpassed;
whilst the shames of life were measureless. Yet even this scheme of extinction
by death was but tamely copying her rival's method without the reasons
which had glorified it in her rival's case. She glided rapidly up and down
the room, as was mostly her habit when excited, her hands ha nging clasped
in front of her, as she thought and in part expressed in broken words:
`O, I hate her, yet I don't mean that I hate her, for it is grievous and
wicked; and yet I hate her a little! Yes, my flesh insists upon hating
her, whether my spirit is willing or no!... If she had only lived, I could
have been angry and cruel towards her with some justification; but to be
vindictive towards a poor dead woman recoils upon myself. O God, have mercy!
I am miserable at all this!'

<P>Bathsheba became at this moment so terrified at her own state of mind
that she looked around for some sort of refuge from herself. The vision
of Oak kneeling down that night recurred to her, and with the imitative
instinct which animates women she seized upon the idea, resolved to kneel,
and, if possible, pray. Gabriel had prayed; so would she.

<P>She knelt beside the coffin, covered her face with her hands, and for
a time the room was silent as a tomb. Whether from a purely mechanical,
or from any other cause, when Bathsheba arose it was with a quieted spirit,
and a regret for the antagonistic ins tincts which had seized upon her
just before.

<P>In her desire to make atonement she took flowers from a vase by the
window, and began laying them around the dead girl's head. Bathsheba knew
no other way of showing kindness to persons departed than by giving them
flowers. She knew not how long she remai ned engaged thus. She forgot time,
life, where she was, what she was doing. A slamming together of the coach-house
doors in the yard brought her to herself again. An instant after, the front
door opened and closed, steps crossed the hall, and her husband appeared
at the entrance to the room, looking in upon her.

<P>He beheld it all by degrees, stared in stupefaction at the scene, as
if he thought it an illusion raised by some fiendish incantation. Bathsheba,
pallid as a corpse on end, gazed back at him in the same wild way.

<P>So little are instinctive guesses the fruit of a legitimate induction
that, at this moment, as he stood with the door in his hand, Troy never
once thought of Fanny in connection with what he saw. His first confused
idea was that somebody in the house had died.

<P>`Well - what?' said Troy blankly.

<P>`I must go! I must go!' said Bathsheba, to herself more than to him.
She came with a dilated eye towards the door, to push past him.

<P>`What's the matter, in God's name? who's dead?' said Troy. `I cannot
say; let me go out. I want air!' she continued.

<P>`But no; stay, I insist!' He seized her hand, and then volition seemed
to leave her, and she went off into a state of passivity. He, still holding
her, came up the room, and thus, hand in hand, Troy and Bathsheba approached
the coffin's side.

<P>The candle was standing on a bureau close by them, and the light, slanted
down, distinctly enkindling the cold features of both mother and babe.
Troy looked in, dropped his wife's hand, knowledge of it all come over
him in a lurid sheen, and he stood stil l.

<P>So still he remained that he could be imagined to have left in him no
motive power whatever. The clashes of feeling in all directions confounded
one another, produced a neutrality, and there was motion in none.

<P>`Do you know her?' said Bathsheba, in a small enclosed echo, as from
the interior of a cell.

<P>`I do,' said Troy.

<P>`Is it she?'

<P>`It is.'

<P>He had originally stood erect. And now, in the well-nigh congealed immobility
of his frame could be discerned an incipient movement, as in the darkest
night may be discerned light after a while. He was gradually sinking forwards.
The lines of his features softened, and dismay modulated to illimitable
sadness. Bathsheba was regarding him from the other side, still with parted
lips and distracted eyes. Capacity for intense feeling is proportionate
to the general intensity of the nature, and perhaps in all F anny's suffering,
much greater relatively to her strength, there never was a time when she
suffered in an absolute sense what Bathsheba suffered now.

<P>What Troy did was to sink upon his knees with an indefinable union of
remorse and reverence upon his face, and, bending ever Fanny Robin, gently
kissed her, as one would kiss an infant asleep to avoid awakening it.

<P>At the sight and sound of that, to her, unendurable act, Bathsheba sprang
towards him. All the strong feelings which had been scattered over her
existence since she knew what feeling was, seemed gathered together into
one pulsation now. The revulsion from her indignant mood a little earlier,
when she had meditated upon compromised honour, forestalment, eclipse in
maternity by another, was violent and entire. All that was forgotten in
the simple and still strong attachment of wife to husband. She had sighe
d for her self-completeness then, and now she cried aloud against the severance
of the union she had deplored. She flung her arms round Troy's neck, exclaiming
wildly from the deepest deep of her heart--

<P>`Don't - don't kiss them! O, Frank, I can't bear it - I can't! I love
you better than she did; kiss me too, Frank - kiss me! <I>You will Frank,
kiss me too</I>!'

<P>There was something so abnormal and startling in the childlike pain
and simplicity of this appeal from a woman of Bathsheba's calibre and independence,
that Troy, loosening her tightly clasped arms from his neck, looked at
her in bewilderment. It was such an unexpected revelation of all women
being alike at heart, even those so different in their accessories as Fanny
and this one beside him, that Troy could hardly seem to believe her to
be his proud wife Bathsheba. Fanny's own spirit seemed to be animatin g
her frame. But this was the mood of a few instants only. When the momentary
surprise had passed, his expression changed to a silencing imperious gaze.

<P>`I will not kiss you!' he said, pushing her away.

<P>Had the wife now but gone no further. Yet, perhaps, under the harrowing
circumstances, to speak out was the one wrong act which can be better understood,
if not forgiven in her, than the right and politic one, her rival being
now but a corpse. All the fee ling she had been betrayed into showing she
drew back to herself again by a strenuous effort of self-command.

<P>`What have you to say as your reason?' she asked, her bitter voice being
strangely low - quite that of another woman now.

<P>`I have to say that I have been a bad, black-hearted man' he answered.
`And that this woman is your victim; and I not less than she.'

<P>`Ah! don't taunt me, madam. This woman is more to me, dead as she is,
than ever you were, or are, or can be. If Satan had not tempted me with
that face of yours, and those cursed coquetries, I should have married
her. I never had another thought till you came in my way. Would to God
that I had; but it is all too late! I deserve to live in torment for this!'
He turned to Fanny then. `But never mind, darling,' he said; `in the sight
of Heaven you are my very, very wife!'

<P>At these words arose from Bathsheba's lips a long, low cry of measureless
despair and indignation, such a wail of anguish as had never before been
heard within those old-inhabited walls. It was the Tetelestou of her union
with Troy.

<P>`If she's - that, - what - am I?' she added, as a continuation of the
same cry, and sobbing pitifully; and the rarity with her of such abandonment
only made the condition more dire.

<P>`You are nothing to me - nothing,' said Troy heartlessly. `A ceremony
before a priest doesn't make a marriage. I am not morally yours.

<P>A vehement impulse to flee from him, to run from this place, hide, and
escape his words at any price, not stopping short of death itself, mastered
Bathsheba now. She waited not an instant, but turned to the door and ran
out.
