CHAPTER FIFTY-SEVEN</H1>

<H2>
A Foggy Night and Morning - Conclusion</H2>
`The most private, secret, plainest wedding that it is possible to have.'
Those had been Bathsheba's words to Oak one evening, some time after the
event of the preceding chapter, and he meditated a hill hour by the clock
upon how to carry out her wishes to the letter.

<P>`A license - O yes, it must be a license,' he said to himself at last.
`Very well, then; first, a license.'

<P>On a dark night, a few days later, Oak came with mysterious steps from
the surrogate's door in Casterbridge. On the way home he heard a heavy
tread in front of him, and, overtaking the man, found him to be Coggan.
They walked together into the village until they came to a little lane
behind the church, leading down to the cottage of Laban Tall, who had lately
been installed as clerk of the parish, and was yet in mortal terror at
church on Sundays when he heard his lone voice among certain hard words
of the Psalms, whither no man ventured to follow him.

<P>`Well, good-night, Coggan,' said Oak, `I'm going down this way.'

<P>`Oh!' said Coggan, surprised; `what's going on to-night, then, make
so bold, Mr Oak?'

<P>It seemed rather ungenerous not to tell Coggan, under the circumstances,
for Coggan had been true as steel all through the time of Gabriel's unhappiness
about Bathsheba, and Gabriel said, `You can keep a secret, Coggan?'

<P>`You've proved me, and you know.'

<P>`Yes, I have, and I do know. Well, then, mistress and I mean to get
married tomorrow morning.'

<P>`Heaven's high tower! And yet I've thought of such a thing from time
to time; true, I have. But keeping it so close! Well, there, 'tis no consarn
of mine, and I wish 'ee joy o' her.'

<P>`Thank you, Coggan. But I assure 'ee that this great hush is not what
I wished for at all, or what either of us would have wished if it hadn't
been for certain things that would make a gay wedding seem hardly the thing.
Bathsheba has a great wish that all the parish shrill not be in church,
looking at her - she's shy - like and nervous about it, in fact - so I
be doing this to humour her.'

<P>`Ay, I see: quite right, too, I suppose I must say. And you be now going
down to the clerk.'

<P>`Yes; you may as well come with me.'

<P>`I am afeard your labour in keeping it close will be throwed away,'
said Coggan, as they walked along. `Labe Tall's old woman will horn it
all over parish in half-an-hour.'

<P>`So she will, upon my life; I never thought of that,' said Oak, pausing.
`Yet I must tell him to-night, I suppose, for he's working so far off,
and leaves early.'

<P>`I'll tell 'ee how we could tackle her,' said Coggan. `I'll knock and
ask to speak to Laban outside the door, you standing in the background.
Then he'll come out, and you tell yer tale. She'll never guess what I want
en for; and I'll make up a few words about the farm-work, as a blind.'

<P>This scheme was considered feasible; and Coggan advanced boldly, and
rapped at Mrs Tall's door. Mrs Tall herself opened it.

<P>`I wanted to have a word with Laban.'

<P>`He's not at home, and won't be this side of eleven o'clock. He've been
forced to go over to Yalbury since shutting out work. I shall do quite
as well.'

<P>`I hardly think you will. Stop a moment,' and Coggan stepped round the
corner of the porch to consult Oak.

<P>`Who's t'other man, then?' said Mrs Tall.

<P>`Only a friend,' said Coggan.

<P>`Say he's wanted to meet mistress near church-hatch to-morrow morning
at ten,' said Oak, in a whisper. `That he must come without fail, and wear
his best clothes.'

<P>`The clothes will floor us as safe as houses!' said Coggan.

<P>`It can't be helped,' said Oak. `Tell her.'

<P>So Coggan delivered the message. `Mind, het or wet, blow or snow, he
must come,' added Jan. `'Tis very particular, indeed. The fact is, 'tis
to witness her sign some law-work about taking shares wi' another farmer
for a long span o' years. There, that's what 'tis, and now I've told 'ee,
Mother Tall, in a way I shouldn't ha' done if I hadn't loved 'ee so hopeless
well.'

<P>Coggan retired before she could ask any further; and next they called
at the vicar's in a manner which excited no curiosity at all. Then Gabriel
went home, and prepared for the morrow.

<P>`Liddy,' said Bathsheba, on going to bed that night, `I want you to
call me at seven o'clock to-morrow, in case I shouldn't wake.'

<P>`But you always do wake afore then, ma'am.'

<P>`Yes, but I have something important to do, which I'll tell you of when
the time comes, and it's best to make sure.'

<P>Bathsheba, however, awoke voluntarily at four, nor could she by any
contrivance get to sleep again. About six, being quite positive that her
watch had stopped during the night, she could wait no longer. She went
and tapped at Liddy's door, and after some labour awoke her.

<P>`But I thought it was I who had to call you?' said the bewildered Liddy.
`And it isn't six yet.'

<P>`Indeed it is; how can you tell such a story, Liddy! I know it must
be ever so much past seven. Come to my room as soon as you can; I want
you to give my hair a good brushing.'

<P>When Liddy came to Bathsheba's room her mistress was already waiting.
Liddy could not understand this extraordinary promptness. `Whatever <I>is</I>
going on, ma'am?' she said.

<P>`Well, I'll tell you,' said Bathsheba, with a mischievous smile in her
bright eyes. `Farmer Oak is coming here to dine with me to-day!'

<P>`Farmer Oak - and nobody else? - you two alone?'

<P>`Yes.'

<P>`But is it safe, ma'am, after what's been said?' asked her companion,
dubiously. `A woman's good name is such a perishable article that--'

<P>Bathsheba laughed with a flushed cheek, and whispered in Liddy's ear,
although there was nobody present. Then Liddy stared and exclaimed, `Souls
alive, what news! It makes my heart go quite bumpity-bump!'

<P>`It makes mine rather furious, too,' said Bathsheba. `However, there's
no getting out of it now!'

<P>It was a damp disagreeable morning. Nevertheless, at twenty minutes
to ten o'clock, Oak came out of his house, and
<BLOCKQUOTE>Went up the hill side
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With that sort of stride
<BR>&nbsp;

and knocked at Bathsheba's door. Ten minutes later a large and a smaller
umbrella might have been seen moving from the same door, and through the
mist along the road to the church. The distance was not more than a quarter
of a mile, and these two sensible persons deemed it unnecessary to drive.
An observer must have been very close indeed to discover that the forms
under the umbrellas were those of Oak and Bathsheba, arm-in-arm for the
first time in their lives, Oak in a greatcoat extending to his knees, and
Bathsheba in a cloak that reached her clods. Yet, though so plainly dressed,
there was a certain rejuvenated appearance about her:--
<BLOCKQUOTE>As though a rose should shut and be a bud again.</BLOCKQUOTE>
Repose had again incarnadined her cheeks; and having, at Gabriel's request,
arranged her hair this morning as she had worn it years ago on Norcombe
Hill, she seemed in his eyes remarkably like the girl of that fascinating
dream, which, considering that she was now only three or four-and-twenty,
was perhaps not very wonderful. In the church were Tall, Liddy, and the
parson, and in a remarkably short space of time toe deed was done.

<P>The two sat down very quietly to tea in Bathsheba's parlour in the evening
of the same day, for it had been arranged that farmer Oak should go there
to live, since he had as yet neither money, house, nor furniture worthy
of the name, though he was on a sure way towards them, whilst Bathsheba
was, comparatively, in a plethora of all three.

<P>Just as Bathsheba was pouring out a cup of tea, their ears were greeted
by the firing of a cannon, followed by what seemed like a tremendous blowing
of trumpets, in the front of the house.

<P>`There!' said Oak, laughing, `I knew those fellows were up to something,
by the look on their faces.'

<P>Oak took up the light and went into the porch, followed by Bathsheba
with a shawl over her head. The rays fell upon a group of male figures
gathered upon the gravel in front, who, when they saw the newly-married
couple in the porch, set up a loud `Hurrah!' and at the same moment bang
again went the cannon in the background followed by a hideous clang of
music from a drum, tambourine, clarionet, serpent, hautboy, tenor-viol,
and double-bass - the only remaining relics of the true and original Weatherbury
band - venerable worm-eaten instruments, which had celebrated in their
own persons the victories of Marlborough, under the fingers of the forefathers
of those who played them now. The performers came forward, and marched
up to the front.

<P>`Those bright boys, Mark Clark and Jan, are at the bottom of all this,'
said Oak. `Come in, souls, and have something to eat and drink wi' me and
my wife.'

<P>`Not to-night,' said Mark Clark, with evident self-denial. `Thank ye
all the same; but we'll call at a more seemly time. However, we couldn't
think of letting the day pass without a note of admiration of some sort.
If ye could send a drop of som' at down to Warren's, why so it is. Here's
long life and happiness to neighbour Oak and his comely bride!'

<P>`Thank ye; thank ye all!' said Gabriel. `A bit and a drop shall be sent
to Warren's for ye at once. I had a thought that we might very likely get
a salute of some sort from our old friends, and I was saying so to my wife
but now.'

<P>`Faith,' said Coggan, in a critical tone, turning to his companions,
`the man hev learnt to say "my wife" in a wonderful naterel way, considering
how very youthful he is in wedlock as yet - hey, neighbours all?'

<P>`I never heerd a skilful old married feller of twenty years' standing
pipe "my wife" in a more used note than 'a did,' said Jacob Smallbury.
`It might have been a little more true to nater if't had been spoke a little
chillier, but that wasn't to be expected just now.'

<P>`That improvement will come wi' time,' said Jan, twirling his eye. Then
Oak laughed. Bathsheba smiled (for she never laughed readily now), and
their friends turned to go.

<P>`Yes; I suppose that's the size o't,' said Joseph Poorgrass with a cheerful
sigh as they moved away; `and I wish him joy o' her; though I were once
or twice upon saying today with holy Hosea, in my scripture manner, which
is my second nature, "Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone." But since
'tis as 'tis, why, it might have been worse, and I feel my thanks accordingly.'
