CHAPTER SIX</H1>

<H2>
The Fair - The Journey - The Fire</H2>
Two months passed away. We are brought on to a day in February, on which
was held the yearly statute or hiring fair in the county-town of Casterbridge.

<P>At one end of the street stood from two to three hundred blithe and
hearty labourers waiting upon Chance - all men of the stamp to whom labour
suggests nothing worse than a wrestle with gravitation, and pleasure nothing
better than a renunciation of the same. Among these, carters and waggoners
were distinguished by having a piece of whip-cord twisted round their hats;
thatchers wore a fragment of woven straw; shepherds held their sheep-crooks
in their hands; and thus the situation required was known to the hirers
at a glance.

<P>In the crowd was an athletic young fellow of somewhat superior appearance
to the rest - in fact, his superiority was marked enough to lead several
ruddy peasants standing by to speak to him inquiringly, as to a farmer,
and to use `Sir' as a finishing word. His answer always was,--

<P>`I am looking for a place myself - a bailiffs. Do ye know of anybody
who wants one?'

<P>Gabriel was paler now. His eyes were more meditative, and his expression
was more sad. He had passed through an ordeal of wretchedness which had
given him more than it had taken away. He had sunk from his modest elevation
as pastoral king into the very slime-pits of Siddim; but there was left
to him a dignified calm he had never before known, and that indifference
to fate which, though it often makes a villain of a man, is the basis of
his sublimity when it does not. And thus the abasement had been exaltation,
and the loss gain.

<P>In the morning a regiment of cavalry had left the town, and a sergeant
and his party had been beating up for recruits through the four streets.
As the end of the day drew on, and he found himself not hired, Gabriel
almost wished that he had joined them, and gone off to serve his country.
Weary of standing in the market-place, and not much minding the kind of
work he turned his hand to, he decided to offer himself in some other capacity
than that of bailiff.

<P>All the farmers seemed to be wanting shepherds. Sheep-tending was Gabriel's
speciality. Turning down an obscure street and entering an obscurer lane,
he went up to a smith's shop.

<P>`How long would it take you to make a shepherd's crook?'

<P>`Twenty minutes.'

<P>`How much?'

<P>`Two shillings.'

<P>He sat on a bench and the crook was made, a stem being given him into
the bargain.

<P>He then went to a ready-made clothes shop, the owner of which had a
large rural connection. As the crook had absorbed most of Gabriel's money,
he attempted, and carried out, an exchange of his overcoat for a shepherd's
regulation smock-frock.

<P>This transaction having been completed he again hurried off to the centre
of the town, and stood on the kerb of the pavement, as a shepherd, crook
in hand.

<P>Now that Oak had turned himself into a shepherd it seemed that bailiffs
were most in demand. However, No or three farmer noticed him and drew near.
Dialogues followed, more or less in the subjoined form:--

<P>`Where do you come from?'

<P>`Norcombe.'

<P>`That's a long way.'

<P>`Fifteen miles.'

<P>`Whose farm were you upon last?'

<P>`My own.'

<P>This reply invariably operated like a rumour of cholera. The inquiring
farmer would edge away and shake his head dubiously. Gabriel, like his
dog, was too good to be trustworthy, and he never made advance beyond this
point.

<P>It is safer to accept any chance that offers itself, and extemporize
a procedure to fit it, than to get a good plan matured, and wait for a
chance of using it. Gabriel wished he had not nailed up his colours as
a shepherd, but had laid himself out for anything in the whole cycle of
labour that was required in the fair. It grew dusk. Some merry men were
whistling and singing by the corn-exchange. Gabriel's hand, which had lain
for some time idle in his smockfrock pocket, touched his flute, which he
carried there. Here was an opportunity for putting his dearly bought wisdom
into practice.

<P>He drew out his flute and began to play `Jockey to the Fair' in the
style of a man who had never known a moment's sorrow. Oak could pipe with
Arcadian sweetness,' and the sound of the well-known notes cheered his
own heart as well as those of the loungers. He played on with spirit, and
in half an hour had earned in pence what was a small fortune to a destitute
man.

<P>By making inquiries he learnt that there was another fair at Shottsford
the next day.

<P>`How far is Shottsford?'

<P>`Ten miles t'other side of Weatherbury.'

<P>Weatherbury! It was where Bathsheba had gone two months before. This
information was like coming from night into noon.

<P>`How far is it to Weatherbury?'

<P>`Five or six miles.'

<P>Bathsheba had probably left Weatherbury long before this time, but the
place had enough interest attaching to it to lead Oak to choose Shottsford
fair as his next field of inquiry, because it lay in the Weatherbury quarter.
Moreover, the Weatherbury folk were by no means uninteresting intrinsically.
If report spoke truly they were as hardy, merry, thriving, wicked a set
as any in the whole county. Oak resolved to sleep at Weatherbury that night
on his way to Shottsford, and struck out at once into the high road which
had been recommended as the direct route to the village in question.

<P>The road stretched through water-meadows traversed by little brooks,
whose quivering surfaces were braided along their centres, and folded into
creases at the sides; or, where the flow was more rapid, the stream was
pied with spots of white froth, which rode on in undisturbed serenity.
On the higher levels the dead and dry carcasses of leaves tapped the ground
as they bowled along helter-skelter upon the shoulders of the wind, and
little birds in the hedges were rustling their feathers and tucking themselves
in comfortably for the night, retaining their places if Oak kept moving,
but flying away if he stopped to look at them. He passed by Yalbury Wood
where the game-birds were rising to their roosts, and heard the crack-voiced
cock-pheasants' `cu-uck, cuck', and the wheezy whistle of the hens.

<P>By the time he had walked three or four miles every shape in the landscape
had assumed a uniform hue of blackness. He descended Yalbury Hill and could
just discern ahead of him a waggon, drawn up under a great over-hanging
tree by the roadside.

<P>On coming close, he found there were no horses attached to it, the spot
being apparently quite deserted. The waggon, from its position, seemed
to have been left there for the night, for beyond about half a truss of
hay which was heaped in the bottom, it was quite empty. Gabriel sat down
on the shafts of the vehicle and considered his position. He calculated
that he had walked a very fair proportion of the journey; and having been
on foot since daybreak, he felt tempted to lie down upon the hay in the
waggon instead of pushing on to the village of Weatherbury, and having
to pay for a lodging.

<P>Eating his last slices of bread and ham, and drinking from the bottle
of cider he had taken the precaution to bring with him, he got into the
lonely waggon. Here he spread half of the hay as a bed, and as well as
he could in the darkness, pulled the other half over him by way of bedclothes,
covering himself entirely, and feeling, physically, as comfortable as ever
he had been in his life. Inward melancholy it was impossible for a man
like Oak, introspective far beyond his neighbours, to banish quite, whilst
conning the present untoward page of his history. So, thinking of his misfortunes,
amorous and pastoral, he fell asleep, shepherds enjoying, in common with
sailors, the privilege of being able to summon the god instead of having
to wait for him.

<P>On somewhat suddenly awaking, after a sleep of whose length he had no
idea, Oak found that the waggon was in motion. He was being carried along
the road at a rate rather considerable for a vehicle without springs, and
under circumstances of physical uneasiness, his head being dandled up and
down on the bed of the waggon like a kettledrum-stick. He then distinguished
voices in conversation, coming from the forepart of the waggon. His concern
at this dilemma (which would have been alarm, had he been a thriving man;
but misfortune is a fine opiate to personal terror) led him to peer cautiously
from the hay, and the first sight he beheld was the stars above him. Charles's
Wain was getting towards a right angle with the Pole star, and Gabriel
concluded that it must be about nine o'clock - in other words, that he
had slept two hours. This small astronomical calculation was made without
any positive effort, and whilst he was stealthily turning to discover,
if possible, into whose hands he had fallen.

<P>Two figures were dimly visible in front, sitting with their legs outside
the waggon, one of whom was driving. Gabriel soon found that this was the
waggoner, and it appeared they had come from Casterbridge fair, like himself.

<P>A conversation was in progress, which continued thus:--

<P>`Be as 'twill, she's a fine handsome body as far's looks be concerned.
But that's only the skin of the woman, and these dandy cattle be as proud
as a lucifer in their insides.'

<P>`Ay - so 'a do seem, Billy Smallbury - so 'a do seem.' This utterance
was very shaky by nature, and more so by circumstance, the jolting of the
waggon not being without its effect upon the speaker's larynx. It came
from the man who held the reins.

<P>`She's a very vain feymell so 'tis said here and there.'

<P>`Ah, now. If so be 'tis like that, I can't look her in the face, lord,
no: not I - heh-heh-heh! Such a shy man as I be!'

<P>`Yes - she's very vain. 'Tis said that every night at going to bed she
looks in the glass to put on her nightcap properly.'

<P>`And not a married woman. Oh, the world!'

<P>`And 'a can play the peanner, so 'tis said. Can play so clever that
'a can make a psalm tune sound as well as the merriest loose song a man
can wish for.'

<P>`D'ye tell o't! A happy time for us, and I feel quite a new man! And
how do she pay?'

<P>`That I don't know, Mister Poorgrass.'

<P>On hearing these and other similar remarks, a wild thought flashed into
Gabriel's mind that they might be speaking of Bathsheba. There were, however,
no grounds for retaining such a supposition, for the waggon, though going
in the direction of Weatherbury, might be going beyond it, and the woman
alluded to seemed to be the mistress of some estate. They were now apparently
close upon Weatherbury, and not to alarm the speakers unnecessarily Gabriel
slipped out of the waggon unseen.

<P>He turned to an opening in the hedge, which he found to be a gate, and
mounting thereon he sat meditating whether to seek a cheap lodging in the
village, or to ensure a cheaper one by lying under some hay or corn stack.
The crunching angle of the waggon died upon his ear. He was about to walk
on, when he noticed on his left hand an unusual light - appearing about
half a mile distant. Oak watched it, and the glow increased. Something
was on fire.

<P>Gabriel again mounted the gate, and, leaping down on the other side
upon what he found to be ploughed soil, made across the field in the exact
direction of the fire. The blaze, enlarging in a double ratio by his approach
and its own increase, showed him as he drew nearer the outlines of ricks
beside it, lighted up to great distinctness. A rick-yard was the source
of the fire. His weary face now began to be painted over with a rich orange
glow, and the whole front of his smock-front and gaiters was covered with
a dancing shadow pattern of thorn-twigs - the light reaching him through
a leafless intervening hedge - and the metallic curve of his sheep-crook
shone silver-bright in the same abounding rays. He came up to the boundary
fence, and stood to regain breath. It seemed as if the spot was unoccupied
by a living soul.

<P>The fire was issuing from a long straw-stack, which was so far gone
as to preclude a possibility of saving it. A rick burns differently from
a house. As the wind blows the fire inwards, the portion in flames completely
disappears like melting sugar, and the outline is lost to the eye. However,
a hay or a wheat rick, well put together, will resist combustion for a
length of time if it begins on the outside.

<P>This before Gabriel's eyes was a rick of straw, loosely put together,
and the flames darted into it with lightning swiftness. It glowed on the
windward side, rising and falling in intensity like the coal of a cigar.
Then a superincumbent bundle rolled down with a whisking noise; flames
elongated, and bent themselves about with a quiet roar, but no crackle.
Banks of smoke went off horizontally at the back like passing clouds, and
behind these burned hidden pyres, illuminating the semi-transparent sheet
of smoke to a lustrous yellow uniformity. Individual straws in the foreground
were consumed in a creeping movement of ruddy heat, as if they were knots
of red worms, and above shone imaginary fiery faces, tongues hanging from
lips, glaring eyes, and other impish forms, from which at intervals sparks
flew in clusters like birds from a nest.

<P>Oak suddenly ceased from being a mere spectator by discovering the case
to be more serious than he had at first imagined. A scroll of smoke blew
aside and revealed to him a wheat-rick in startling juxtaposition with
the decaying one, and behind this a series of others, composing the main
corn produce of the farm; so that instead of the straw-stack standing,
as he had imagined, comparatively isolated, there was a regular connection
between it and the remaining stacks of the group.

<P>Gabriel leapt over the hedge, and saw that he was not alone. The first
man he came to was running about in a great hurry, as if his thoughts were
several yards in advance of his body, which they could never drag on fast
enough.

<P>`O, man - fire, fire! A good master and a bad servant is fire, fire!
- I mane a bad servant and a good master. O Mark Clark - come! And you,
Billy Smallbury - and you, Maryann Money - and you, Jan Coggan, and Matthew
there!' Other figures now appeared behind this shouting man and among the
smoke, and Gabriel found that, far from being alone, he was in a great
company - whose shadows danced merrily up and down, timed by the jigging
of the flames, and not at all by their owners movements. The assemblage
belonging to that class of society which casts its thoughts into the form
of feeling, and its feelings into the form of commotion - set to work with
a remarkable confusion of purpose.

<P>`Stop the draught under the wheat-rick!' cried Gabriel to those nearest
to him. The corn stood on stone staddles, and between these, tongues of
yellow hue from the burning straw licked and darted playfully. If the fire
once got <I>under</I> this stack, all would be lost.

<P>`Get a tarpaulin - quick!' said Gabriel.

<P>A rick-cloth was brought, and they hung it like a curtain across the
channel. The flames immediately ceased to go under the bottom of the corn-stack,
and stood up vertical.

<P>`Stand here with a bucket of water and keep the cloth wet,' said Gabriel
again.

<P>The flames, now driven upwards, began to attack the angles of the huge
roof covering the wheat-stack.

<P>`A ladder,' cried Gabriel.

<P>`The ladder was against the straw-rick and is burnt to a cinder,' said
a spectre-like form in the smoke.

<P>Oak seized the cut ends of the sheaves, as if he were going to engage,
in the operation of `reed-drawing', and digging in his feet, and occasionally
sticking in the stem of his sheep-crook, he clambered up the beetling face.
He at once sat astride the very apex, and began with his crook to beat
off the fiery fragments which had lodged thereon, shouting to the others
to get him a bough and a ladder, and some water.

<P>Billy Smallbury - one of the men who had been on the waggon - by this
time had found a ladder, which Mark Clark ascended, holding on beside Oak
upon the thatch. The smoke at this corner was stifling, and Clark, a nimble
fellow, having been handed a bucket of water, bathed Oak's face and sprinkled
him generally, whilst Gabriel, now with a long beech-bough in one hand,
in addition to his crook in the other, kept sweeping the stack and dislodging
all fiery particles.

<P>On the ground the groups of villagers were still occupied in doing all
they could to keep down the conflagration, which was not much. They were
all tinged orange, and backed up by shadows of varying pattern. Bound the
corner of the largest stack, out of the direct rays of the fire, stood
a pony, bearing a young woman on its back. By her side was another woman,
on foot. These two seemed to keep at a distance from the fire, that the
horse might not become restive.

<P>`He's a shepherd,' said the woman on foot. `Yes - he is. See how his
crook shines as he beats the rick with it. And his smock-frock is burnt
in two holes, I declare! A fine young shepherd he is too, ma'am.'

<P>`Whose shepherd is he?' said the equestrian in a clear voice. `Don't
know, ma'am.'

<P>`Don't any of the others know?'

<P>`Nobody at all - I've asked 'em. Quite a stranger, they say.'

<P>The young woman on the pony rode out from the shade and looked anxiously
around.

<P>`Do you think the barn is safe?' she said.

<P>`D'ye think the barn is safe, Jan Coggan?' said the second woman, passing
on the question to the nearest man in that direction.

<P>`Safe now - leastwise I think so. If this rick had gone the barn would
have followed. 'Tis that bold shepherd up there that have done the most
good - he sitting on the top o' rick, whizzing his great long arms about
like a windmill.'

<P>`He does work hard,' said the young woman on horseback, looking up at
Gabriel through her thick woollen veil, `I wish he was shepherd here. Don't
any of you know his name?'

<P>`Never heard the man's name in my life, or seed his form afore.'

<P>The fire began to get worsted, and Gabriel's elevated position being
no longer required of him, he made as if to descend.

<P>`Maryann,' said the girl on horseback, `go to him as he comes down,
and say that the farmer wishes to thank him for the great service he has
done.'

<P>Maryann stalked off towards the rick and met Oak at the foot of the
ladder. She delivered her message.

<P>`Where is your master the farmer?' asked Gabriel, kindling with the
idea of getting employment that seemed to strike him now.

<P>`'Tisn't a master; 'tis a mistress, shepherd.'

<P>`A woman farmer?'

<P>`Ay, 'a b'lieve, and a rich one too!' said a bystander. `lately 'a came
here from a distance. Took on her uncle's farm, who died suddenly. Used
to measure his money in halfpint cups. They say now that she've business
in every bank in Casterbridge, and thinks no more of playing pitch-and-toss
sovereign than you and I do pitch-halfpenny - not a bit in the world, shepherd.'

<P>`That's she, back there upon the pony,' said Maryann; `wi' her face
a-covered up in that black cloth with holes in it.'

<P>Oak, his features smudged, grimy, and undiscoverable from the smoke
and heat, his smock-frock burnt into holes and dripping with water, the
ash stem of his sheep-crook charred six inches shorter, advanced with the
humility stern adversity had thrust upon him up to he slight female form
in the saddle. He lifted his hat with respect, and not without gallantry;
stepping close to her hanging feet he said in a hesitating voice,--

<P>`Do you happen to want a shepherd, ma'am?'

<P>She lifted the wool veil tied round her face, and looked all astonishment.
Gabriel and his cold-hearted darling, Bathsheba Everdene, were face to
face.

<P>Bathsheba did not speak, and he mechanically repeated in an abashed
and sad voice,--

<P>`Do you want a shepherd, ma'am?'
