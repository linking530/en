CHAPTER FORTY-ONE</H1>

<H2>
Suspicion - Fanny is sent for</H2>
Bathsheba said very little to her husband all that evening of their return
from market, and he was not disposed to say much to her. He exhibited the
unpleasant combination of a restless condition with a silent tongue. The
next day, which was Sunday, passed nearly in the same manner as regarded
their taciturnity, Bathsheba going to church both morning and afternoon.
This was the day before the Budmouth races. In the evening Troy said, suddenly--

<P>`Bathsheba, could you let me have twenty pounds?'

<P>Her countenance instantly sank. `Twenty pounds?' she said.

<P>`The fact is, I want it badly.' The anxiety upon Troy's face was unusual
and very marked. It was a culmination of the mood he had been in all the
day.

<P>`Ah! for those races to-morrow.'

<P>Troy for the moment made no reply. Her mistake had its advantages to
a man who shrank from having his mind inspected as he did now. `Well, suppose
I do want it for races?' he said, at last.

<P>`O, Frank!' Bathsheba replied, and there was such a volume of entreaty
in the words. `Only such a few weeks ago you said that I was far sweeter
than all your other pleasures put together, and that you would give them
all up for me; and now, won't you give up this one, which is more a worry
than a pleasure? Do, Frank. Come, let me fascinate you by all I can do
- by pretty words and pretty looks, and everything I can think of - to
stay at home. Say yes to your wife - say yes!'

<P>The tenderest and softest phases of Bathsheba's nature were prominent
now - advanced impulsively for his acceptance, without any of the disguises
and defences which the wariness of her character when she was cool too
frequently threw over them. Few men could have resisted the arch yet dignified
entreaty of the beautiful face, thrown a little back and sideways in the
well-known attitude that expresses more than the words it accompanies,
and which seems to have been designed for these special occasions. Had
the woman not been his wife, Troy would have succumbed instantly; as it
was, he thought he would not deceive her longer.

<P>`The money is not wanted for racing debts at all,' he said.

<P>`What is it for?' she asked. `You worry me a great deal by these mysterious
responsibilities, Frank.'

<P>Troy hesitated. He did not now love her enough to allow himself to be
carried too far by her ways. Yet it was necessary to be civil. `You wrong
me by such a suspicious manner, he said. `Such strait-waistcoating as you
treat me to is not becoming in you at so early a date.'

<P>`I think that I have a right to grumble a little if I pay,' she said
with features between a smile and a pout.

<P>`Exactly; and, the former being done, suppose we proceed to the latter.
Bathsheba, fun is all very well, but don't go too far, or you may have
cause to regret something.'

<P>She reddened. `I do that already,' she said quickly. `What do you regret?'

<P>`That my romance has come to an end.'

<P>`All romances end at marriage.'

<P>`I wish you wouldn't talk like that. You grieve me to my soul by being
smart at my expense.

<P>`You are dull enough at mine. I believe you hate me.'

<P>`Not you - only your faults. I do hate them.'

<P>`'Twould be much more becoming if you set yourself to cure them. Come,
let's strike a balance with the twenty pounds, and be friends.'

<P>She gave a sigh of resignation. `I have about that sum here for household
expenses. If you must have it, take it.'

<P>`Very good. Thank you. I expect I shall have gone away before you are
in to breakfast tomorrow.

<P>`And must you go? Ah! there was a time, Frank, when it would have taken
a good many promises to other people to drag you away from me. You used
to call me darling, then. But it doesn't matter to you how my days are
passed now.'

<P>`I must go, in spite of sentiment.' Troy, as he spoke, looked at his
watch, and, apparently actuated by <I>non lucendo</I> principles, opened
the case at the back, revealing, snugly stowed within it, a small coil
of hair.

<P>Bathsheba's eyes had been accidentally lifted at that moment, and she
saw the action and saw the hair. She flushed in pain and surprise, and
some words escaped her before she had thought whether or not it was wise
to utter them. `A woman's curl of hair!' she said. `O, Frank, whose is
that?'

<P>Troy had instantly closed his watch. He carelessly replied, as one who
cloaked some feelings that the sight had stirred: `Why, yours, of course.
Whose should it be? I had quite forgotten that I had it.'

<P>`What a dreadful fib, Frank!'

<P>`I tell you I had forgotten it!' he said loudly.

<P>`I don't mean that - it was yellow hair.'

<P>`Nonsense.'

<P>`That's insulting me. I know it was yellow. Now whose was it? I want
to know.'

<P>`Very well - I'll tell you, so make no more ado. It is the hair of a
young woman I was going to marry before I knew you.'

<P>`You ought to tell me her name, then.'

<P>`I cannot do that.'

<P>`Is she married yet?'

<P>`No.'

<P>`Is she alive?'

<P>`Yes.'

<P>`Is she pretty?'

<P>`Yes.'

<P>`It is wonderful how she can be, poor thing, under such an awful affliction!'

<P>`Affliction - what affliction?' he inquired quickly.

<P>`Having hair of that dreadful colour.'

<P>`Oh - ho - I like that!' said Troy, recovering himself. `Why, her hair
has been admired by everybody who has seen her since she has worn it loose,
which has not been long. It is beautiful hair. People used to turn their
heads to look at it, poor girl!'

<P>`Pooh! that's nothing!' she exclaimed, in incipient accents of pique.
`If I cared for your love as much as I used to I could say people had turned
to look at mine.'

<P>`Bathsheba, don't be so fitful and jealous. You knew what married life
would be like, and shouldn't have entered it if you feared these contingencies.'

<P>Troy had by this time driven her to bitterness: her heart was big in
her throat, and the ducts to her eyes were painfully full. Ashamed as she
was to show emotion, at last she burst out:--

<P>`This is all I get for loving you so well! Ah! when I married you your
life was dearer to me than my own. I would have died for you - how truly
I can say that I would have died for you! And now you sneer at my foolishness
in marrying you. O! is it kind to me to throw my mistake in my face? Whatever
opinion you may have of my wisdom, you should not tell me of it so mercilessly,
now that I am in your power.'

<P>`I can't help how things fall out,' said Troy; `upon my heart, women
will be the death of me!'

<P>`Well, you shouldn't keep people's hair. You'll burn it, won't you,
Frank?'

<P>Frank went on as if he had not heard her. `There are considerations
even before my consideration for you; reparations to be made - ties you
know nothing of. If you repent of marrying, so do I.'

<P>Trembling now, she put her hand upon his arm, saying, in mingled tones
of wretchedness and coaxing, `I only repent it if you don't love me better
than any woman in the world! I don't otherwise, Frank. You don't repent
because you already love somebody better than you love me, do you?'

<P>`I don't know. Why do you say that?'

<P>`You won't burn that curl. You like the woman who owns that pretty hair
- yes; it is pretty - more beautiful than my miserable black mane! Well,
it is no use; I can't help being ugly. You must like her best, if you will!'

<P>`Until to-day, when I took it from a drawer, I have never looked upon
that bit of hair for several months - that I am ready to swear.'

<P>`But just now you said "ties"; and then - that woman we met?'

<P>`'Twas the meeting with her that reminded me of the hair.'

<P>`Is it hers, then?'

<P>`Yes. There, now that you have wormed it out of me, I hope you are content.

<P>`And what are the ties?'

<P>`Oh! that meant nothing - a mere jest.'

<P>`A mere jest!' she said, in mournful astonishment. `Can you jest when
I am so wretchedly in earnest? Tell me the truth, Frank. I am not a fool,
you know, although I am a woman, and have my woman's moments. Come! treat
me fairly,' she said, looking honestly and fearlessly into his face. `I
don't want much; bare justice - that's all! Ah! once I felt I could be
content with nothing less than the highest homage from the husband I should
choose. Now, anything short of cruelty will content me. Yes! the independent
and spirited Bathsheba is come to this!'

<P>`For Heaven's sake don't be so desperate!' Troy said snappishly, rising
as he did so, and leaving the room.

<P>Directly he had gone, Bathsheba burst into great sobs - dry-eyed sobs,
which cut as they came, without any softening by tears. But she determined
to repress all evidences of feeling. She was conquered; but she would never
own it as long as she lived. Her pride was indeed brought low by despairing
discoveries of her spoliation by marriage with a led pure nature than her
own. She chafed to and fro in rebelliousness, like a caged leopard; her
whole soul was in arms, and the blood fired her face. Until she had met
Troy, Bathsheba had been proud of her position as a woman; it had been
a glory to her to know that her lips had been touched by no man's on earth
- that her waist had never been encircled by a lover's arm. She hated herself
now. In those earlier days she had always nourished a secret contempt for
girls who were the slaves of the first good-looking young fellow who should
choose to salute them. She had never taken kindly to the idea of marriage
in the abstract as did the majority of women she saw about her. In the
turmoil of her anxiety for her lover she had agreed to marry him; but the
perception that had accompanied her happiest hours on this account was
rather that of self sacrifice than of promotion and honour. Although she
scarcely knew the divinity's name, Diana was the goddess whom Bathsheba
instinctively adored. That she had never, by look, word, or sign, encouraged
a man to approach her - that she had felt herself sufficient to herself,
and had in the independence of her girlish heart fancied there was a certain
degradation in renouncing the simplicity of a maiden existence to become
the humbler half of an indifferent matrimonial whole - were facts now bitterly
remembered. O, if she had never stooped to folly of this kind, respectable
as it was, and could only stand again, as she had stood on the hill at
Norcombe, and dare Troy or any other man to pollute a hair of her head
by his interference!

<P>The next morning she rose earlier than usual, and had the horse saddled
for her ride round the farm in the customary way. When she came in at half-past
eight - their usual hour for breakfasting - she was informed that her husband
had risen, taken his breakfast, and driven off to Casterbridge with the
gig and Poppet.

<P>After breakfast she was cool and collected - quite herself in fact and
she rambled to the gate, intending to walk to another quarter of the farm,
which she still personally superintended as well as her duties in the house
would permit, continually, however, finding herself preceded in forethought
by Gabriel Oak, for whom she began to entertain the genuine friendship
of a sister. Of course, she sometimes thought of him in the light of an
old lover, and had momentary imaginings of what life with him as a husband
would have been like; also of life with Boldwood under the same conditions.
But Bathsheba, though she could feel, was not much given to futile dreaming,
and her musings under this head were short and entirely confined to the
times when Troy's neglect was more than ordinarily evident.

<P>She saw coming up the road a man like Mr Boldwood. It was Mr Boldwood.
Bathsheba blushed painfully, and watched. The farmer stopped when still
a long way off, and held up his hand to Gabriel Oak, who was in a footpath
across the field. The two men then approached each other and seemed to
engage in earnest conversation.

<P>Thus they continued for a long time. Joseph Poorgrass now passed near
them, wheeling a barrow of apples up the hill to Bathsheba's residence.
Boldwood and Gabriel called to him, spoke to him for a few minutes, and
then all three parted, Joseph immediately coming up the hill with his barrow.

<P>Bathsheba, who had seen this pantomime with some surprise, experienced
great relief when Boldwood turned back again. `Well, what's the message,
Joseph?' she said.

<P>He set down his barrow, and, putting upon himself the refined aspect
that a conversation with a lady required, spoke to Bathsheba over the gate.

<P>`You'll never see Fanny Robin no more - use nor principal - ma'am.'

<P>`Why?'

<P>`Because she's dead in the Union. `Fanny dead - never!'

<P>`Yes, ma'am.'

<P>`What did she die from?'

<P>`I don't know for certain; but I should be inclined to think it was
from general neshness of constitution. She was such a limber maid that
'a could stand no hardship, even when I knowed her, and 'a went like a
candle-snoff, so 'tis said. She was took bad in the morning, and, being
quite feeble and worn out, she died in the evening. She belongs by law
to our parish; and Mr Boldwood is going to send a waggon at three this
afternoon to fetch her home here and bury her.'

<P>`Indeed I shall not let Mr Boldwood do any such thing - I shall do it!
Fanny was my uncle's servant, and, although I only knew her for a couple
of days, she belongs to me. How very, very sad this is! - the idea of Fanny
being in a workhouse.' Bathsheba had begun to know what suffering was,
and she spoke with real feeling.... `Send across to Mr Boldwood's, and
say that Mrs Troy will take upon herself the duty of fetching an old servant
of the family. We ought not to put her in a waggon; we'll get a hearse.'

<P>`There will hardly be time, ma'am, will there?'

<P>`Perhaps not,' she said, musingly. `When did you say we must be at the
door - three o'clock?'

<P>`Three o'clock this afternoon, ma'am, so to speak it.'

<P>`Very well - you go with it. A pretty waggon is better than an ugly
hearse, after all. Joseph, have the new spring waggon with the blue body
and red wheels, and wash it very clean. And, Joseph--'

<P>`Yes, ma'am.'

<P>`Carry with you some evergreens and flowers to put upon her coffin -
indeed, gather a great many, and completely bury her in them. Get some
boughs of laurustinus, and variegated box, and yew, and boy's-love; ay,
and some bunches of chrysanthemum. And let old Pleasant draw her, because
she knew him so well.'

<P>`I will, ma'am. I ought to have said that the Union, in the form of
four labouring men, will meet me when I gets to our churchyard gate, and
take her and bury her according to the rites of the Board of Guardians,
as by law ordained.'

<P>`Dear me - Casterbridge Union - and is Fanny come to this?' said Bathsheba,
musing. `I wish I had known of it sooner. I thought she was far away. How
long has she lived there?'

<P>`On'y been there a day or two.'

<P>`Oh! - then she has not been staying there as a regular inmate?'

<P>`No. She first went to live in a garrison-town t'other side o' Wessex,
and since then she's been picking up a living at seampstering in Melchester
for several months, at the house of a very respectable widow-woman who
takes in work of that sort. She only got handy the Union-house on Sunday
morning 'a b'lieve, and 'tis supposed here and there that she had traipsed
every step of the way from Melchester. Why she left her place I can't say,
for I don't know; and as to a lie, why, I wouldn't tell it. That's the
short of the story, ma'am.'

<P>`Ah-h!'

<P>No gem ever flashed from a rosy ray to a white one more rapidly than
changed the young wife's countenance whilst this word came from her in
a long-drawn breath. `Did she walk along our turnpike-road?' she said,
in a suddenly restless and eager voice.

<P>`I believe she did... Ma'am, shall I call Liddy? You bain't well, ma'am,
surely? You look like a lily - so pale and fainty!'

<P>`No; don't call her; it is nothing. When did she pass Weatherbury?'

<P>`Last Saturday night.'

<P>`That will do, Joseph; now you may go.'

<P>`Certainly, ma'am.'

<P>`Joseph, come hither a moment. What was the colour of Fanny Robin's
hair?'

<P>`Really, mistress, now that 'tis put to me so judge-and-jury like, I
can't call to mind, if ye'll believe me!'

<P>`Never mind; go on and do what I told you. Stop - well, no, go on.'

<P>She turned herself away from him, that he might no longer notice the
mood which had set its sign so visibly upon her, and went indoors with
a distressing sense of faintness and a beating brow. About an hour after,
she heard the noise of the waggon and went out, still with a painful consciousness
of her bewildered and troubled look' Joseph, dressed in his best suit of
clothes, was putting in the horse to start. The shrubs and flowers were
all piled in the waggon, as she had directed. Bathsheba hardly saw them
now.

<P>`Whose sweetheart did you say, Joseph?'

<P>`I don't know, ma'am.'

<P>`Are you quite sure?'

<P>`Yes, ma'am, quite sure.'

<P>`Sure of what?'

<P>`I'm sure that all I know is that she arrived in the morning and died
in the evening without farther parley. What Oak and Mr Boldwood told me
was only these few words "Little Fanny Robin is dead, Joseph," Gabriel
said, looking in my face in his steady old way. I was very sorry, and I
said, "Ah! - and how did she come to die?" "Well, she's dead in Casterbridge
Union," he said; "and perhaps 'tisn't much matter about how she came to
die. She reached the Union early Sunday morning, and died in the afternoon
- that's clear enough." Then I asked what she'd been doing lately, and
Mr Boldwood turned round to me then, and left off spitting a thistle with
the end of his stick. He told me about her having lived by seampstering
in Melchester, as I mentioned to you, and that she walked therefrom at
the end of last week, passing near here Saturday night in the dusk. They
then said I had better just name a hent of her death to you, and away they
went. Her death might have been brought on by biding in the night wind,
you know, ma'am; for people used to say she'd go off in a decline: she
used to cough a good deal in winter time. However, 'tisn't much odds to
us about that now, for 'tis all over.'

<P>`Have you heard a different story at all?' She looked at him so intently
that Joseph's eyes quailed.

<P>`Not a word, mistress, I assure 'ee!' he said. `Hardly anybody in the
parish knows the news yet.'

<P>`I wonder why Gabriel didn't bring the message to me himself. He mostly
makes a point of seeing me upon the most trifling errand.' These words
were merely murmured, and she was looking upon the ground.

<P>`Perhaps he was busy, ma'am,' Joseph suggested. `And sometimes he seems
to suffer from things upon his mind, connected with the time when he was
better off than 'a is now. 'A's rather a curious item, but a very understanding
shepherd, and learned in books.'

<P>`Did anything seem upon his mind whilst he was speaking to you about
this?'

<P>`I cannot but say that there did, ma'am. He was terrible down, and so
was Farmer Boldwood.'

<P>`Thank you, Joseph. That will do. Go on now, or you'll be late.'

<P>Bathsheba, still unhappy, went indoors again. In the course of the afternoon
she said to Liddy, who had been informed of the occurrence, `What was the
colour of poor Fanny Robin's hair? Do you know? I cannot recollect - I
only saw her for a day or two.'

<P>`It was light, ma'am; but she wore it rather short, add packed away
under her cap, so that you would hardly notice it. But I have seen her
let it down when she was going to bed, and it looked beautiful then. Real
golden hair.'

<P>`Her young man was a soldier, was he not?'

<P>`Yes. In the same regiment as Mr Troy. He says he knew him very well.'

<P>`What, Mr Troy says so? How came he to say that?'

<P>`One day I just named it to him, and asked him if he knew Fanny's young
man. He said, "O yes, he knew the young man as well as he knew himself,
and that there wasn't a man in the regiment he liked better."'

<P>`Ah! Said that, did he?'

<P>`Yes; and he said there was a strong likeness between himself and the
other young man, so that sometimes people mistook them--'

<P>`Liddy, for Heaven's sake stop your talking!' said Bathsheba, with the
nervous petulance that comes from worrying perceptions.
