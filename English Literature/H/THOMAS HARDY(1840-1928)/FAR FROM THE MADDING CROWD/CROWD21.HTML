<H2>
Troubles in the Fold - A Message</H2>
Gabriel Oak had ceased to feed the Weatherbury flock for about four-and-twenty
hours, when on Sunday afternoon the elderly gentlemen Joseph Poorgrass,
Matthew Moon, Fray, and half-a-dozen others, came running up to the house
of the mistress of the Upper Farm.

<P>`Whatever <I>is</I> the matter, men?' she said, meeting them at the
door just as she was coming out on her way to church, and ceasing in a
moment from the close compression of her two red lips, with which she had
accompanied the exertion of pulling on a tight glove.

<P>`Sixty!' said Joseph Poorgrass.

<P>`Seventy!' said Moon.

<P>`Fifty-nine!' said Susan Tall's husband.

<P>` - Sheep have broke fence,' said Fray.

<P>` - And got into a field of young clover,' said Tall.

<P>` - Young clover!' said Moon.

<P>` - Clover!' said Joseph Poorgrass.

<P>`And they be getting blasted,' said Henery Fray.

<P>`That they be,' said Joseph.

<P>`And will all die as dead as nits, if they bain't got out and cured!'
said Tall.

<P>Joseph's countenance was drawn into lines and puckers by his concern.
Fray's forehead was wrinkled both perpendicularly and crosswise, after
the pattern of a portcullis, expressive of a double despair. Laban Tall's
lips were thin, and his face was rigid. Matthew's jaws sank, and his eyes
turned whichever way the strongest muscle happened to pull them.

<P>`Yes,' said Joseph, `and I was sitting at home looking for Ephesians,
and says I to myself, "'Tis nothing but Corinthians and Thessalonians in
this danged Testament," when who should come in but Henery there: "Joseph,"
he said, "the sheep have blasted theirselves - "'

<P>With Bathsheba it was a moment when thought was speech and speech exclamation.
Moreover, she had hardly recovered her equanimity since the disturbance
which she had suffered from Oak's remarks.

<P>`That's enough - that's enough - O you fools!' she cried, throwing the
parasol and Prayer-book into the passage, and running out of doors in the
direction signified. 'to come to me, and not go and get them out directly!
O, the stupid numskulls!'

<P>Her eyes were at their darkest and brightest now. Bathsheba's beauty
belonging rather to the demonian than to the angelic school, she never
looked so well as when she was angry - and particularly when the effect
was heightened by a rather dashing velvet dress carefully put on before
a glass.

<P>All the ancient men ran in a jumbled throng after her to the cloverfield,
Joseph sinking down in the midst when about halfway, like an individual
withering in a world which was more and more insupportable. Having once
received the stimulus that her presence always gave them they went round
among the sheep with a will. The majority of the afflicted animals were
lying down, and could not be stirred. These were bodily lifted out, and
the others driven into the adjoining field. Here, after the lapse of a
few minutes, several more fell down, and lay helpless and livid as the
rest.

<P>Bathsheba, with a sad, bursting heart, looked at these primest specimens
of her prime flock as they rolled there--
<BLOCKQUOTE>Swoln with wind and the rank mist they drew</BLOCKQUOTE>
Many of them foamed at the mouth, their breathing being quick and short,
whilst the bodies of all were fearfully distended.

<P>`O, what can I do' what can I do!' said Bathsheba, helplessly. `Sheep
are such unfortunate animals! - there's always something happening to them!
I never knew a flock pass a year without getting into some scrape or other.'

<P>`There's only one way of saving them,' said Tall.

<P>`What way? Tell me quick!'

<P>`They must be pierced in the side with a thing made on purpose.

<P>`Can you do it? Can I?'

<P>`No' ma'am. We can't, nor you neither. It must be done in a particular
spot. If ye go to the right or left but an inch you stab the ewe and kill
her. Not even a shepherd can do it, as a rule.'

<P>`Then they must die,' she said, in a resigned tone.

<P>`Only one man in the neighbourhood knows the way,' said Joseph, now
just come up. He could cure 'em all if he were here.'

<P>`Who is he? Let's get him!'

<P>`Shepherd Oak,' said Matthew. `Ah, he's a clever man in talents!'

<P>`Ah, that he is so!' said Joseph Poorgrass.

<P>`True - he's the man,' said Laban Tall.

<P>`How dare you name that man in my presence!' she said excitedly. `I
told you never to allude to him, nor shall you if you stay with me. Ah!'
she added, brightening, `Farmer Boldwood knows!'

<P>`O no' ma'am,' said Matthew. 'two of his store ewes got into some vetches
t'other day, and were just like these. He sent a man on horseback here
post-haste for Gable, and Gable went and saved `em. Farmer Boldwood hev
got the thing they do it with. 'tis a holler pipe, with a sharp pricker
inside. Isn't it, Joseph?'

<P>`Ay - a holler pipe,' echoed Joseph. 'that's what 'tis.'

<P>`Ay, sure - that's the machine,' chimed in Henery Fray reflectively,
with an Oriental indifference to the flight of time.

<P>`Well,' burst out Bathsheba, `don't stand there with your "ayes" and
your "sures", talking at me! Get somebody to cure the sheep instantly!'

<P>All then stalked off in consternation, to get somebody as directed,
without any idea of who it was to be. In a minute they had vanished through
the gate, and she stood alone with the dying flock.

<P>`Never will I send for him - never!' she said firmly.

<P>One of the ewes here contracted its muscles horribly, extended itself,
and jumped high into the air. The leap was an astonishing one. The ewe
fell heavily, and lay still.

<P>Bathsheba went up to it. The sheep was dead.

<P>`O, what shall I do - what shall I do' she again exclaimed, wringing
her hands. `I won't send for him. No, I won't!'

<P>The most vigorous expression of a resolution does not always coincide
with the greatest vigour of the resolution itself. It is often flung out
as a sort of prop to support a decaying conviction which, whilst strong,
required no enunciation to prove it so. The `No,' I won't' of Bathsheba
meant virtually, `I think I must.'

<P>She followed her assistants through the gate, and lifted her hand to
one of them. Laban answered to her signal.

<P>`Where is Oak staying?'

<P>`Across the valley at Nest Cottage.

<P>`Jump on the bay mare, and ride across, and say he must return instantly
- that I say so.

<P>Tall scrambled off to the field, and in two minutes was on Poll, the
bay, bare-backed, and with only a halter by way of rein. He diminished
down the hill.

<P>Bathsheba watched. So did all the rest. Tall cantered along the bridle
path through Sixteen Acres, Sheeplands, Middle Field, The Flats, Cappels
Piece, shrank almost to a point, crossed the bridge, and ascended from
the valley through Springmead and Whitepits on the other side. The cottage
to which Gabriel had retired before taking his final departure from the
locality was visible as a white spot on the opposite hill, backed by blue
firs. Bathsheba walked up and down. The men entered the field and endeavoured
to ease the anguish of the dumb creatures by rubbing them. Nothing availed.

<P>Bathsheba continued walking. The horse was seen descending the hill,
and the wearisome series had to be repeated in reverse order: Whitepits,
Springmead, Cappel's Piece, The Flats, Middle Field, Sheeplands, Sixteen
Acres. She hoped Tall had had presence of mind enough to give the mare
up to Gabriel, and return himself on foot. The rider neared them. It was
Tall.

<P>`O what folly!' said Bathsheba.

<P>Gabriel was not visible anywhere.

<P>`Perhaps he is already gone!' she said.

<P>Tall came into the inclosure, and leapt off his face tragic as Morton's
after the battle of Shrewsbury.

<P>`Well?' said Bathsheba, unwilling to believe that her verbal <I>lettre-de-cachet</I>
could possibly have miscarried.

<P>`He says <I>beggars mustn't be choosers</I>,' replied Laban.

<P>`What!' said the young farmer, opening her eyes and drawing in her breath
for an outburst. Joseph Poorgrass retired a few steps behind a hurdle.

<P>`He says he shall not come onless you request en to come civilly and
in a proper manner, as becomes any 'ooman begging a favour.'

<P>`Oh, oh, that's his answer! Where does he get his airs? Who am I, then,
to be treated like that? Shall I beg to a man who has begged to me?'

<P>Another of the flock sprang into the air, and fell dead.

<P>The men looked grave, as if they suppressed opinion.

<P>Bathsheba turned aside, her eyes full of tears. The strait she was in
through pride and shrewishness could not be disguised longer: she burst
out crying bitterly; they all saw it; and she attempted no further concealment.

<P>`I wouldn't cry about it, miss,' said William Smallbury compassionately.
`Why not ask him softer like? I'm sure he'd come then. Gable is a true
man in that way.

<P>Bathsheba checked her grief and wiped her eyes. `O, it is a wicked cruelty
to me - it is - it is!' she murmured. `And he drives me to do what I wouldn't;
yes, he does! - Tall, come indoors.'

<P>After this collapse, not very dignified for the head of an establishment,
she went into the house, Tall at her heels. Here she sat down and hastily
scribbled a note between the small convulsive sobs of convalescence which
follow a fit of crying as a ground-swell follows a storm. The note was
none the less polite for being written in a hurry. She held it at a distance,
was about to fold it, then added these words at the bottom:--
<BLOCKQUOTE>`<I>Do not desert me, Gabriel</I>!'</BLOCKQUOTE>
She looked a little redder in refolding it, and closed her lips, as if
thereby to suspend till too late the action of conscience in examining
whether such strategy were justifiable. The note was despatched as the
message had been, and Bathsheba waited indoors for the result.

<P>It was an anxious quarter of an hour that intervened between the messenger's
departure and the sound of the horse's tramp again outside. She could not
watch this time, but, leaning over the old bureau at which she had written
the letter, closed her eyes, as if to keep out both hope and fear.

<P>The case, however, was a promising one. Gabriel was not angry: he was
simply neutral, although her first command had been so haughty. Such imperiousness
would have damned a little less beauty; and on the other hand, such beauty
would have redeemed a little less imperiousness.

<P>She went out when the horse was heard, and looked up. A mounted, figure
passed between her and the sky, and drew on towards the field of sheep,
the rider turning his face in receding. Gabriel looked at her. It was a
moment when a woman's eyes and tongue tell distinctly opposite tales. Bathsheba
looked hall of gratitude, and she said:--

<P>`O, Gabriel, how could you serve me so unkindly!'

<P>Such a tenderly-shaped reproach for his previous delay was the one speech
in the language that he could pardon for not being commendation of his
readiness now.

<P>Gabriel murmured a confused reply, and hastened on. She knew from the
look which sentence in her note had brought him. Bathsheba followed to
the field.

<P>Gabriel was already among the turgid, prostrate forms. He had flung
off his coat, rolled up his shirt-sleeves, and taken from his pocket the
instrument of salvation. It was a small tube or trochar, with a lance passing
down the inside; and Gabriel began to use it with a dexterity that would
have graced a hospital-surgeon. Passing his hand over the sheep's left
flank, and selecting the proper point, he punctured the skin and rumen
with the lance as it stood in the tube; then he suddenly withdrew the lance,
retaining the tube in its place. A current of air rushed up the tube, forcible
enough to have extinguished a candle held at the orifice.

<P>It has been said that mere ease after torment is delight for a time;
and the countenances of these poor creatures expressed it now. Forty-nine
operations were successfully performed. Owing to the great hurry necessitated
by the far-gone state of some of the flock, Gabriel missed his aim in one
case, and in one only - striking wide of the mark, and inflicting a mortal
blow at once upon the suffering ewe. Four had died; three recovered without
an operation. The total number of sheep which had thus strayed and injured
themselves so dangerously was fifty-seven.

<P>When the love-led man had ceased from his labours Bathsheba came and
looked him in the face.

<P>`Gabriel, will you stay on with me?' she said, smiling winningly, and
not troubling to bring her lips quite together again at the end, because
there was going to be another smile soon.

<P>`I will,' said Gabriel.

<P>And she smiled on him again.
