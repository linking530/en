CHAPTER FIFTY-THREE</H1>

<H2>
Concurritur - Hor&aelig; Momento</H2>
Outside the front of Boldwood's house a group of men stood in the dark,
with their faces towards the door, which occasionally opened and closed
for the passage of some guest or servant, when a golden rod of light would
stripe the ground for the moment and vanish again, leaving nothing outside
but the glowworm shine of the pale lamp amid the evergreens over the door.

<P>`He was seen in Casterbridge this afternoon - so the boy said,' one
of them remarked in a whisper. `And I for one believe it. His body was
never found, you know.'

<P>`'Tis a strange story,' said the next. `You may depend upon't that she
knows nothing about it.'

<P>`Not a word.'

<P>`Perhaps he don't mean that she shall,' said another man.

<P>`If he's alive and here in the neighbourhood, he means mischief,' said
the first. `Poor young thing: I do pity her, if 'tis true. He'll drag her
to the dogs.'

<P>`O no; he'll settle down quiet enough,' said one disposed to take a
more hopeful view of the case.

<P>`What a fool she must have been ever to have had anything to do with
this man! She is so self-willed and independent too, that one is more minded
to say it serves her right than pity her.'

<P>`No, no! I don't hold with 'ee there. She was no otherwise than a girl
mind, and how could she tell what the man was made of? If 'tis really true,
'tis too hard a punishment, and more than she ought to hae. - Hullo, who's
that?' This was to some footsteps that were heard approaching.

<P>`William Smallbury,' said a dim figure in the shades, coming up and
joining them. `Dark as a hedge, to-night, isn't it? I all but missed the
plank over the river ath'art there in the bottom - never did such a thing
before in my life. Be ye any of Boldwood's workfolk?' He peered into their
faces.

<P>`Yes - all o' us. We met here a few minutes ago.'

<P>`Oh, I hear now - that's Sam Samway: thought I knowed the voice, too.
Going in?'

<P>`Presently. But I say, William,' Samway whispered, `have ye heard this
strange tale?'

<P>`What - that about Sergeant Troy being seen, d'ye mean, souls?' said
Smallbury, also lowering his voice.

<P>`Ay: in Casterbridge.'

<P>`Yes, I have. Laban Tall named a hint of it to me but now - but I don't
think it. Hark, here Laban comes himself, 'a b'lieve.' A footstep drew
near.

<P>`Laban?'

<P>`Yes, 'tis I,' said Tall.

<P>`Have ye heard any more about that?'

<P>`No,' said Tall, joining the group. `And I'm inclined to think we'd
better keep quiet. If so be 'tis not true, 'twill flurry her, and do her
much harm to repeat it; and if so be 'tis true, 'twill do no good to forestall
her time o' trouble. God send that it mid be a lie, for though Henery Fray
and some of 'em do speak against her, she's never been anything but fair
to me. She's hot and hasty, but she's a brave girl who'll never tell a
lie however much the truth may harm her, and I've no cause to wish her
evil.'

<P>`She never do tell women's little lies, that's true; and 'tis a thing
that can be said of very few. Ay, all the harm she thinks she says to yer
face: there's nothing underhand wi' her.'

<P>They stood silent then, every man busied with his own thoughts, during
which interval sounds of merriment could be heard within. Then the front
door again opened, the rays streamed out, the well-known form of Boldwood
was seen in the rectangular area of light, the door closed, and Boldwood
walked slowly down the path.

<P>`'Tis master,' one of the men whispered, as he neared them. `We'd better
stand quiet - he'll go in again directly. He would think it unseemly o'
us to be loitering here.'

<P>Boldwood came on, and passed by the men without seeing them, they being
under the bushes on the grass. He paused, leant over the gate, and breathed
a long breath. They heard low words come from him.

<P>`I hope to God she'll come, or this night will be nothing but misery
to me! O my darling, my darling, why do you keep me in suspense like this?'

<P>He said this to himself, and they all distinctly heard it. Boldwood
remained silent after that, and the noise from indoors was again just audible,
until, a few minutes later, light wheels could be distinguished coming
down the hill. They drew nearer, and ceased at the gate. Boldwood hastened
back to the door, and opened it; and the light shone upon Bathsheba coming
up the path.

<P>Boldwood compressed his emotion to mere welcome: the men marked her
light laugh and apology as she met him: he took her into the house; and
the door closed again.

<P>`Gracious heaven, I didn't know it was like that with him!' said one
of the men. `I thought that fancy of his was over long ago.'

<P>`You don't know much of master, if you thought that,' said Samway. `I
wouldn't he should know we heard what 'a said for the world,' remarked
a third.

<P>`I wish we had told of the report at once,' the first uneasily continued.
`More harm may come of this than we know of Poor Mr Boldwood, it will be
hard upon en. I wish Troy was in - Well, God forgive me for such a wish!
A scoundrel to play a poor wife such tricks. Nothing has prospered in Weatherbury
since he came here. And now I've no heart to go in. Let's look into Warren's
for a few minutes first, shall us, neighbours?'

<P>Samway, Tall, and Smallbury agreed to go to Warren's, and went out at
the gate, the remaining ones entering the house. The three soon drew near
the malt-house, approaching it from the adjoining orchard, and not by way
of the street. The pane of glass was illuminated as usual. Smallbury was
a little in advance of the rest, when, pausing, he turned suddenly to his
companions and said, `Hist! See there.'

<P>The light from the pane was now perceived to be shining not upon the
ivied wall as usual, but upon some object close to the glass. It was a
human face.

<P>`Let's come closer,' whispered Samway; and they approached on tip-toe.
There was no disbelieving the report any longer. Troy's face was almost
close to the pane, and he was looking in. Not only was he looking in, but
he appeared to have been arrested by a conversation which was in progress
in the malt-house, the voices of the interlocutor being those of Oak and
the maltster.

<P>`The spree is all in her honour, isn't it - hey?' said the old man.
`Although he made believe 'tis only keeping up o' Christmas?'

<P>`I cannot say,' replied Oak.

<P>`O 'tis true enough, faith. I cannot understand Farmer Boldwood being
such a fool at his time of life as to ho and hanker after thik woman in
the way 'a do, and she not care a bit about en.'

<P>The men, after recognizing Troy's features, withdrew across the orchard
as quietly as they had come. The air was big with Bathsheba's fortunes
to-night: every word everywhere concerned her. When they were quite out
of earshot all by one instinct paused.

<P>`It gave me quite a turn - his face,' said Tall, breathing.

<P>`And so it did me,' said Samway. `What's to be done?'

<P>`I don't see that 'tis any business of ours,' Smallbury murmured dubiously.

<P>`But it is! 'Tis a thing which is everybody's business,' said Samway.
`We know very well that master's on a wrong tack, and that she's quite
in the dark, and we should let 'em know at once. Laban, you know her best
- you'd better go and ask te speak to her.'

<P>`I bain't fit for any such thing,' said Laban, nervously. `I should
think William ought to do it if anybody. He's oldest.'

<P>`I shall have nothing to do with it,' said Smallbury. `'Tis a ticklish
business altogether. Why, he'll go on to her himself in a few minutes,
ye'll see.'

<P>`We don't know that he will. Come, Laban.'

<P>`Very well, if I must I must, I suppose,' Tall reluctantly answered.
`What must I say?'

<P>`Just ask to see master.'

<P>`O no; I shan't speak to Mr Boldwood. If I tell anybody, 'twill be mistress.'

<P>`Very well,' said Samway.

<P>Laban then went to the door. When he opened it the hum of bustle rolled
out as a wave upon a still strand - the assemblage being immediately inside
the hall - and was deadened to a murmur as he closed it again. Each man
waited intently, and looked around at the dark tree tops gently rocking
against the sky and occasionally shivering in a slight wind, as if he took
interest in the scene, which neither did. One of them began walking up
and down, and then came to where he started from and stopped again, with
a sense that walking was a thing not worth doing now.

<P>`I should think Laban must have seen mistress by this time,' said Smallbury,
breaking the silence. `Perhaps she won't come and speak to him.'

<P>The door opened. Tall appeared, and joined them. `Well?' said both.

<P>`I didn't like to ask for her after all,' Laban faltered out. `They
were all in such a stir, trying to put a little spirit into the party.
Somehow the fan seems to hang fire, though everything's there that a heart
can desire, and I couldn't for my soul interfere and throw damp upon it
- if 'twas to save my life, I couldn't!'

<P>`I suppose we had better all go in together,' said Samway, gloomily.
`Perhaps I may have a chance of saying a word to master.'

<P>So the men entered the hall, which was the room selected and arranged
for the gathering because of its size. The younger men and maids were at
last just beginning a dance. Bathsheba had been perplexed how to act, for
she was not much more than a slim young maid herself, and the weight of
stateliness sat heavy upon her. Sometimes she thought she ought not to
have come under any circumstances; then she considered what cold unkindness
that would have been, and finally resolved upon the middle course of staying
for about an hour only, and gliding off unobserved, having from the first
made upon her mind that she could on no account dance, sing, or take any
active part in the proceedings.

<P>Her allotted hour having been passed in chatting and looking on Bathsheba
told Liddy not to hurry herself and went to the small parlour to prepare
for departure, which, like the hall, was decorated with holly and ivy,
and well lighted up.

<P>Nobody was in the room, but she had hardly been there a moment when
the master of the house entered.

<P>`Mrs Troy - you are not going?' he said. `We've hardly begun!'

<P>`If you'll excuse me, I should like to go now.' Her manner was restive
for she remembered her promise, and imagined what he was about to say.
`But as it is not late,' she added, `I can walk home, and leave my man
and Liddy to come when they choose.'

<P>`I've been trying to get an opportunity of speaking to you,' said Boldwood.
`You know perhaps what I long to say?'

<P>Bathsheba silently looked on the floor.

<P>`You do give it?' he said, eagerly.

<P>`What?' she whispered.

<P>`Now, that's evasion! Why, the promise. I don't want to intrude upon
you at all, or to let it become known to anybody. But do give your word!
A mere business compact, you know, between two people who are beyond the
influence of passion.' Boldwood knew how false this picture was as regarded
himself; but he had proved that it was the only tone in which she would
allow him to approach her. `A promise to marry me at the end of five years
and three quarters. You owe it to me!'

<P>`I feel that I do,' said Bathsheba; `that is, if you demand it. But
I am a changed woman - an unhappy woman - and not - not--'

<P>`You are still a very beautiful woman,' said Boldwood. Honesty and pure
conviction suggested the remark, unaccompanied by any perception that it
might have been adopted by blunt flattery to soothe and win her.

<P>However, it had not much effect now, for she said, in a passionless
murmur which was in itself a proof of her words: `I have no feeling in
the matter at all. And I don't at all know what is right to do in my difficult
position, and I have nobody to advise me. But I give my promise, if I must.
I give it as the rendering of a debt, conditionally, of course, on my being
a widow.'

<P>`You'll marry me between five and six years hence?'

<P>`Don't press me too hard. I'll marry nobody else.'

<P>`But surely you will name the time, or there's nothing in the promise
at all?'

<P>`O I don't know, pray let me go!' she said, her bosom beginning to rise.
`I am afraid what to do! I want to be just to you, and to be that seems
to be wronging myself, and perhaps it is breaking the commandments. There
is considerable doubt of his death, and then it is dreadful; let me ask
a solicitor, Mr Boldwood, if I ought or no!'

<P>`Say the words, dear one, and the subject shall be dismissed; a blissful
loving intimacy of six years, and then marriage - O Bathsheba, say them!'
he begged in a husky voice, unable to sustain the forms of mere friendship
any longer. `Promise yourself to me; I deserve it, indeed I do, for I have
loved you more than anybody in the world! And if I said hasty words and
showed uncalled-for heat of manner towards you, believe me, dear, I did
not mean to distress you; I was in agony, Bathsheba, and I did not know
what I said. You wouldn't let a dog suffer what I have suffered, could
you but know it! Sometimes I shrink from your knowing what I have felt
for you, and sometimes I am distressed that all of it you never will know.
Be gracious, and give up a little to me, when I would give up my life for
you!'

<P>The trimmings of her dress, as they quivered against the light, showed
how agitated she was, and at last she burst out crying. `And you'll not
- press me - about anything more - if I say in five or six years?' she
sobbed, when she had power to frame the words.

<P>`Yes, then I'll leave it to time.'

<P>`Very well. If he does not return, I'll marry you in six years from
this day, if we both live,' she said solemnly.

<P>`And you'll take this as a token from me.'

<P>Boldwood had come close to her side, and now he clasped one of her hands
in both his own, and lifted it to his breast.

<P>`What is it? Oh I cannot wear a ring!' she exclaimed, on seeing what
he held; `besides, I wouldn't have a soul know that it's an engagement!
Perhaps it is improper? Besides, we are not engaged in the usual sense,
are we? Don't insist, Mr Boldwood - don't!' In her trouble at not being
able to get her hand away from him at once, she stamped passionately on
the floor with one foot, and tears crowded to her eyes again.

<P>`It means simply a pledge - no sentiment - the seal of a practical compact,'
he said more quietly, but still retaining her hand in his firm grasp. `Come,
now!' And Boldwood slipped the ring on her finger.

<P>`I cannot wear it,' she said, weeping as if her heart would break. `You
frighten me, almost. So wild a scheme! Please let me go home!'

<P>`Only to-night: wear it just to-night, to please me!'

<P>Bathsheba sat down in a chair, and buried her face in her handkerchief,
though Boldwood kept her hand yet. At length she said, in a sort of hopeless
whisper--

<P>`Very well, then, I will to-night, if you wish it so earnestly. Now
loosen my hand; I will, indeed I will wear it to-night.'

<P>`And it shall be the beginning of a pleasant secret courtship of six
years, with a wedding at the end?'

<P>`It must be, I suppose, since you will have it so!' she said, fairly
beaten into non-resistance.

<P>Boldwood pressed her hand, and allowed it to drop in her lap. `I am
happy now,' he said. `God bless you!'

<P>He left the room, and when he thought she might be sufficiently composed
sent one of the maids to her. Bathsheba cloaked the effects of the late
scene as she best could, followed the girl, and in a few moments came downstairs
with her hat and cloak on, ready to go. To get to the door it was necessary
to pass through the hall, and before doing so she paused on the bottom
of the staircase which descended into one corner, to take a last look at
the gathering.

<P>There was no music or dancing in progress just now. At the lower end,
which had been arranged for the work-folk specially a group conversed in
whispers, and with clouded looks. Boldwood was standing by the fireplace,
and he, too, though so absorbed in visions arising from her promise that
he scarcely saw anything, seemed at that moment to have observed their
peculiar manner, and their looks askance.

<P>`What is it you are in doubt about, men?' he said.

<P>One of them turned and replied uneasily: `It was something Laban heard
of, that's all, sir.'

<P>`News? Anybody married or engaged, born or dead?' inquired the farmer,
gaily. `Tell it to us, Tall. One would think from your looks and mysterious
ways that it was something very dreadful it indeed.

<P>`O no, sir, nobody is dead,' said Tall.

<P>`I wish somebody was,' said Samway, in a whisper.

<P>`What do you say, Samway?' said Boldwood, somewhat sharply. `If you
have anything to say, speak out; if not, get up another dance.

<P>`Mrs Troy has come downstairs,' said Samway to Tall. `If you want to
tell her, you had better do it now.'

<P>`Do you know what they mean?' the farmer asked Bathsheba, across the
room.

<P>`I don't in the least,' said Bathsheba.

<P>There was a smart rapping at the door. One of the men opened it instantly,
and went outside.

<P>`Mrs Troy is wanted,' he said, on returning.

<P>`Quite ready,' said Bathsheba. `Though I didn't tell them to send.'

<P>`It is a stranger, ma'am,' said the man by the door.

<P>`A stranger?' she said.

<P>`Ask him to come in,' said Boldwood.

<P>The message was given, and Troy, wrapped up to his eyes as we have seen
him, stood in the doorway.

<P>There was an unearthly silence, all looking towards the newcomer. Those
who had just learnt that he was in the neighbourhood recognized him instantly;
those who did not were perplexed. Nobody noted Bathsheba. She was leaning
on the stairs. Her brow had heavily contracted; her whole face was pallid,
her lips apart, her eyes rigidly staring at their visitor.

<P>Boldwood was among those who did not notice that he was Troy. `Come
in, come in!' he repeated, cheerfully, `and drain a Christmas beaker with
us, stranger!'

<P>Troy next advanced into the middle of the room, took off his cap, turned
down his coat-collar, and looked Boldwood in the face. Even then Boldwood
did not recognize that the impersonator of Heaven's persistent irony towards
him, who had once before broken in upon his bliss, scourged him, and snatched
his delight away, had come to do these things a second time. Troy began
to laugh a mechanical laugh: Boldwood recognized him now.

<P>Troy turned to Bathsheba. The poor girl's wretchedness at this time
was beyond all fancy or narration. She had sunk down on the lowest stair;
and there she sat, her mouth blue and dry, and her dark eyes fixed vacantly
upon him, as if she wondered whether it were not all a terrible illusion.

<P>Then Troy spoke. `Bathsheba, I come here for you!'

<P>She made no reply.

<P>`Come home with me: come!'

<P>Bathsheba moved her feet a little, but did not rise.

<P>Troy went across to her.

<P>`Come, madam, do you hear what I say?' he said, peremptorily.

<P>A strange voice came from the fireplace - a voice sounding far off and
confined, as if from a dungeon. Hardly a soul in the assembly recognized
the thin tones to be those of Boldwood. Sudden despair had transformed
him.

<P>`Bathsheba, go with your husband!'

<P>Nevertheless, she did not move. The truth was that Bathsheba was beyond
the pale of activity - and yet not in a swoon. She was in a state of mental
<I>gutta serena</I>; her mind was for the minute totally deprived of light
at the same time that no obscuration was apparent from without.

<P>Troy stretched out his hand to pull her towards him, when she quickly
shrank back. This visible dread of him seemed to irritate Troy, and he
seized her arm and pulled it sharply. Whether his grasp pinched her, or
whether his mere touch was the cause, was never known, but at the moment
of his seizure she writhed, and gave a quick, low scream.

<P>The scream had been heard but a few seconds when it was followed by
a sudden deafening report that echoed through the room and stupefied them
all. The oak partition shook with the concussion, and the place was filled
with grey smoke.

<P>In bewilderment they turned their eyes to Boldwood. At this back, as
he stood before the fireplace, was a gun-rack, as is usual in farmhouses,
constructed to hold two guns. When Bathsheba had cried out in her husband's
grasp, Boldwood's face of gnashing despair had changed. The veins had swollen,
and a frenzied look had gleamed in his eye. He had turned quickly, taken
one of the guns, cocked it, and at once discharged it at Troy.

<P>Troy fell. The distance apart of the two men was so small that the charge
of shot did not spread in the least, but passed like a bullet into his
body. He uttered a long guttural sigh - there was a contraction - an extension
- then his muscles relaxed, and he lay still.

<P>Boldwood was seen through the smoke to be now again engaged with the
gun. It was double-barrelled, and he had, meanwhile, in some way fastened
his handkerchief to the trigger, and with his foot on the other end was
in the act of turning the second barrel upon himself Samway his man was
the first to see this, and in the midst of the general horror darted up
to him. Boldwood had already twitched the handkerchief, and the gun exploded
a second time, sending its contents, by a timely blow from Samway, into
the beam which crossed the ceiling.

<P>`Well, it makes no difference!' Boldwood gasped. `There is another way
for me to die.'

<P>Then he broke from Samway, crossed the room to Bathsheba, and kissed
her hand. He put on his hat, opened the door, and went into the darkness,
nobody thinking of preventing him.
