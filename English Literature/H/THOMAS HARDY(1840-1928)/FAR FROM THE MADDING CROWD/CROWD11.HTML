<H2>
Outside the Barracks - Snow - A Meeting</H2>
For dreariness nothing could surpass a prospect in the outskirts of a certain
town and military station, many miles north of Weatherbury at a later hour
on this same snowy evening - if that may be called a prospect of which
the chief constituent was darkness.

<P>It was a night when sorrow may come to the brightest without causing
any great sense of incongruity: when, with impressible persons, love becomes
solicitousness, hope sinks to misgiving, and faith to hope: when the exercise
of memory does not stir feelings of regret at opportunities for ambition
that have been passed by, and anticipation does not prompt to enterprise.

<P>The scene was a public path, bordered on the left hand by a river, behind
which rose a high wall. On the right was a tract of land, partly meadow
and partly moor, reaching, at its remote verge, to a wide undulating upland.

<P>The changes of the seasons are less obtrusive on spots of this kind
than amid woodland scenery. Still, to a close observer, they are just as
perceptible; the difference is that their media of manifestation are less
trite and familiar than such well-known ones as the bursting of the buds
or the fall of the leaf. Many are not so stealthy and gradual as we may
be apt to imagine in considering the general torpidity of a moor or waste.
Winter, in coming to the country hereabout, advanced in well-marked stages,
wherein might have been successively observed the retreat of the snakes.
The transformation of the ferns, the filling of the pools, a rising of
fogs, the embrowning by frost, the collapse of the fungi, and an obliteration
by snow.

<P>This climax of the series had been reached tonight on the aforesaid
moor, and for the first time in the season its irregularities were forms
without features; suggestive of anything, proclaiming nothing, and without
more character than that of being the limit of something else - the lowest
layer of a firmament of snow. From this chaotic skyful of crowding flakes
the mead and moor momentarily received additional clothing, only to appear
momentarily more naked thereby. The vast arch of cloud above was strangely
low, and formed as it were the roof of a large dark cavern, gradually sinking
in upon its floor; for the instinctive thought was that the snow lining
the heavens and that encrusting the earth would soon unite into one mass
without any intervening stratum of air at all.

<P>We turn our attention to the left-hand characteristics; which were flatness
in respect of the river, verticality in respect of the wall behind it,
and darkness as to both. These features made up the mass. If anything could
be darker than the sky, it was the wall, and if anything could be gloomier
than the wall it was the river beneath. The indistinct summit of the facade
was notched and prolonged by chimneys here and there, and upon its face
were faintly signified the oblong shapes of windows, though only in the
upper part. Below, down to the water's edge, the flat was unbroken by hole
or projection.

<P>An indescribable succession of dull blows, perplexing in their regularity,
sent their sound with difficulty through the fluffy atmosphere. It was
a neighbouring clock striking ten. The bell was in the open air, and being
overlaid with several inches of muffing snow, had lost its voice for the
time.

<P>About this hour the snow abated: ten flakes fell where twenty had fallen,
then one had the room of ten. Not long after a form moved by the brink
of the river.

<P>By its outline upon the colourless background a close observer might
have seen that it was small. This was all that was positively discoverable,
though it seemed human.

<P>The shape went slowly along, but without much exertion, for the snow,
though sudden, was not as yet more than two inches deep. At this time some
words were spoken aloud:--

<P>`One. Two. Three. Four. Five.'

<P>Between each utterance the little shape advanced about half-a-dozen
yards. It was evident now that the windows high in the wall were being
counted. The word `Five' represented the fifth window from the end of the
wall.

<P>Here the spot stopped, and dwindled smaller. The figure was stooping.
Then a morsel of snow flew across the river towards the fifth window. It
smacked against the wall at a point several yards from its mark. The throw
was the idea of a man conjoined with the execution of a woman. No man who
had ever seen bird, rabbit or squirrel in his childhood, could possibly
have thrown with such utter imbecility as was shown here.

<P>Another attempt, and another; till by degrees the wall must have become
pimpled with the adhering lumps of snow. At last one fragment struck the
fifth window.

<P>The river would have been seen by day to be of that deep smooth sort
which races middle and sides with the same gliding precision, any irregularities
of speed being immediately corrected by a small whirlpool. Nothing was
heard in reply to the signal but the gurgle and cluck of one of these invisible
wheels - together with a few small sounds which a sad man would have called
moans, and a happy man laughter - caused by the flapping of the waters
against trifling objects in other parts of the stream.

<P>The window was struck again in the same manner.

<P>Then a noise was heard, apparently produced by the opening of the window.
This was followed by a voice from the same quarter:

<P>`Who's there?'

<P>The tones were masculine, and not those of surprise. The high wall being
that of a barrack, and marriage being looked upon with disfavour in the
army, assignations and communications had probably been made across the
river before tonight.

<P>`Is it Sergeant Troy?*' said the blurred spot in the snow, tremulously.
This person was so much like a mere shade upon the earth, and the other
speaker so much a part of the building, that one would have said the wall
was holding a conversation with the snow.

<P>`Yes,' came suspiciously from the shadow. `What girl are you?'

<P>`O, Frank - don't you know me?' said the spot. `Your wife, Fanny Robin.'

<P>`Fanny!' said the wall, in utter astonishment.

<P>`Yes,' said the girl, with a half-suppressed gasp of emotion.

<P>There was something in the woman's tone which is not that of the wife,
and there was a manner in the man which is rarely a husband's. The dialogue
went on:

<P>`How did you come here?'

<P>`I asked which was your window. Forgive me!'

<P>`I did not expect you tonight. Indeed, I did not think you would come
at all. It was a wonder you found me here. I am orderly tomorrow.'

<P>`You said I was to come.'

<P>`Well - I said that you might.'

<P>`Yes,' I mean that I might. You are glad to see me, Frank?'

<P>`O yes - of course.'

<P>`Can you - come to me?'

<P>`My dear Fan, no! The bugle has sounded, the barrack gates are closed,
and I have no leave. `We are all of us as good as in the county gaol till
tomorrow morning.'

<P>`Then I shan't see you till then!' The words were in a faltering tone
of disappointment.

<P>`How did you get here from Weatherbury?'

<P>`I walked - some part of the way - the rest by the carriers.'

<P>`I am surprised.'

<P>`Yes - so am I. And Frank, when will it be?'

<P>`What?'

<P>`That you promised.'

<P>`I don't quite recollect.'

<P>`O you do! Don't speak like that. It weighs me to the earth. It makes
me say what ought to be said first by you.'

<P>`Never mind - say it.'

<P>`O, must I? - it is, when shall we be married, Frank?'

<P>`Oh, I see. Well - you have to get proper clothes.'

<P>`I have money. Will it be by banns or license?'*

<P>`Banns, I should think.'

<P>`And we live in two parishes.'

<P>`Do we? What then?'

<P>`My lodgings are in St Mary's, and this is not. So they will have to
be published in both.'

<P>`Is that the law?'

<P>`Yes. O Frank - you think me forward, I am afraid! Don't, dear Frank
- will you - for I love you so. And you said lots of times you would marry
me, and - and I - I - I------'

<P>`Don't cry, now! It is foolish. If I said so, of course I will.'

<P>`And shall I put up the banns in my parish, and will you in yours?'

<P>`Yes.'

<P>`To-morrow?'

<P>`Not tomorrow. We'll settle in a few days.'

<P>`You have the permission of the officers?'

<P>`No - not yet.

<P>`O - how is it? You said you almost had before you left Casterbridge.'

<P>`The fact is, I forgot to ask. Your coming like this is so sudden and
unexpected.'

<P>`Yes - yes - it is. It was wrong of me to worry you. I'll go away now.
Will you come and see me tomorrow at Mrs Twills's, in North Street? I don't
like to come to the Barracks. There are bad women about, and they think
me one.'

<P>`Quite so. I'll come to you, my dear. Good-night.'

<P>`Good-night, Frank - good-night!'

<P>And the noise was again heard of a window closing. The little spot moved
away. When she passed the corner a subdued exclamation was heard inside
the wall.

<P>`Ho - ho - Sergeant - ho - ho!' An expostulation followed, but it was
indistinct; and it became lost amid a low peal of laughter, which was hardly
distinguishable from the gurgle of the tiny whirlpools outside.
