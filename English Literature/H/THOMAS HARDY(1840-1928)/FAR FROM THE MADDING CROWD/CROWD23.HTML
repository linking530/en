CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</H1>

<H2>
Eventide - A Second Declaration</H2>
For the shearing-supper a long table was placed on the grass-plot beside
the house, the end of the table being thrust over the sill of the wide
parlour window and a foot or two into the room. Miss Everdene sat inside
the window, facing down the table. She was thus at the head without mingling
with the men.

<P>This evening Bathsheba was unusually excited, her red cheeks and lips
contrasting lustrously with the mazy skeins of her shadowy hair. She seemed
to expect assistance, and the seat at the bottom of the table was at her
request left vacant until after they had begun the meal. She then asked
Gabriel to take the place and the duties appertaining to that end, which
he did with great readiness.

<P>At this moment Mr Boldwood came in at the gate, and crossed the green
to Bathsheba at the window. He apologized for his lateness: his arrival
was evidently by arrangement.

<P>`Gabriel,' said she, `will you move again, please, and let Mr Boldwood
come there?'

<P>Oak moved in silence back to his original seat.

<P>The gentleman-farmer was dressed in cheerful style, in a new coat and
white waistcoat, quite contrasting with his usual sober suits of grey.
Inwardly, toe he was blithe, and consequently chatty to an exceptional
degree. So also was Bathsheba now that he had come, though the uninvited
presence of Pennyways, the bailiff who had been dismissed for theft, disturbed
her equanimity for a while.

<P>Supper being ended, Coggan began on his own private account, without
reference to listeners:--
<BLOCKQUOTE>I've lost my love, and I care not,

<P>I've lost my love, and I care not;

<P>I shall soon have another

<P>That's better than t'other;

<P>I've lost my love, and I care not.</BLOCKQUOTE>
This lyric, when concluded, was received with a silently appreciative gaze
at the table, implying that the performance, like a work by those established
authors who are independent of notices in the papers, was a well-known
delight which required no applause.

<P>`Now, Master Poorgrass, your song!' said Coggan.

<P>`I be all but in liquor, and the gift is wanting in me,' said Joseph,
diminishing himself.

<P>`Nonsense; wou'st never be so ungrateful, Joseph - never!' said Coggan,
expressing hurt feelings by an inflection of voice. `And mistress is looking
hard at ye, as much as to say, "Sing at once, Joseph Poorgrass."'

<P>`Faith, so she is; well, I must suffer it!... Just eye my features,
and see if the tell-tale blood overheats me much, neighbours?'

<P>`No, yer blushes be quite reasonable,' said Coggan.

<P>`I always tries to keep my colours from rising when a beauty's eyes
get fixed on me,' said Joseph diffidently; `but if so be 'tis willed they
do, they must.

<P>`Now, Joseph, your song, please,' said Bathsheba from the window. `Well,
really, ma'am,' he replied in a yielding tone. `I don't know what to say.
It would be a poor plain ballet of my own composure.'

<P>`Hear, hear!' said the supper-party.

<P>Poorgrass, thus assured, trilled forth a flickering yet commendable
piece of sentiment, the tune of which consisted of the key-note and another,
the latter being the sound chiefly dwelt upon. This was so successful that
he rashly plunged into a second in the same breath, after a few false starts:--
<BLOCKQUOTE>I sow'-ed th'-e...

<P>I sow'-ed.

<P>I sow'-ed thee seeds' of' love',

<P>I-it was' all' i'-in thee spring',

<P>I-in April', Ma'-ay, a'-nd sunny' June',

<P>`When sma'-all bi'-irds they' do' sing;</BLOCKQUOTE>
`Well put out of hand,' said Coggan, at the end of the verse. "`They do
sing" was a very taking paragraph.'

<P>`Ay; and there was a pretty place at "seeds of love", and 'twas well
heaved out. Though "love" is a nasty high corner when a man's voice is
getting crazed. Next verse, Master Poorgrass.'

<P>But during this rendering young Bob Coggan exhibited one of those anomalies
which will afflict little people when other persons are particularly serious:
in trying to check his laughter, he pushed down his throat as much of the
tablecloth as he could get hold of when, after continuing hermetically
sealed for a short time, his mirth burst out through his nose. Joseph perceived
it, and with hectic cheeks of indignation instantly ceased singing. Coggan
boxed Bob's ears immediately.

<P>`Go on, Joseph - go on, and never mind the young scamp,' said Coggan.
`'Tis a very catching ballet. Now then again - the next bar; I'll help
ye to flourish up the shrill notes where yer wind is rather wheezy:
<BLOCKQUOTE>the wi'-il-lo'-ow tree' will' twist',

<P>And the wil'-low' tre'-ee wi'-ill twine</BLOCKQUOTE>
But the singer could not be set going again. Bob Coggan was sent home for
his ill manners, and tranquillity was restored by Jacob Smallbury, who
volunteered a ballad as inclusive and interminable as that with which the
worthy toper old Silenus amused on a similar occasion the swains Chromis
and Mnasylus, and other jolly dogs of his day.

<P>It was still the beaming time of evening, though night was stealthily
making itself visible low down upon the ground, the western lines of light
raking the earth without alighting upon it to any extent, or illuminating
the dead levels at all. The sun had crept round the tree as a last effort
before death, and then began to sink, the shearers' lower parts becoming
steeped in embrowning twilight, whilst their heads and shoulders were still
enjoying day, touched with a yellow of self-sustained brilliancy that seemed
inherent rather than acquired.

<P>The sun went down in an ochreous mist; but they sat, and talked on,
and grew as merry as the gods in Homer's heaven. Bathsheba still remained
enthroned inside the window, and occupied herself in knitting, from which
she sometimes looked up to view the fading scene outside. The slow twilight
expanded and enveloped them completely before the signs of moving were
shown.

<P>Gabriel suddenly missed Farmer Boldwood from his place at the bottom
of the table. How long he had been gone Oak did not know; but he had apparently
withdrawn into the encircling dusk. Whilst he was thinking of this Liddy
brought candles into the back part of the room overlooking the shearers,
and their lively new flames shone down the table and over the men, and
dispersed among the green shadows behind.

<P>Bathsheba's form, still in its original position, was now again distinct
between their eyes and the light, which revealed that Boldwood had gone
inside the room, and was sitting near her.

<P>Next came the question of the evening. Would Miss Everdene sing to them
the song she always sang so charmingly - `The Banks of Allan Water' - before
they went home?

<P>After a moment's consideration Bathsheba assented, beckoning to Gabriel,
who hastened up into the coveted atmosphere.

<P>`Have you brought your flute?' she whispered.

<P>`Yes, miss.'

<P>`Play to my singing, then.'

<P>She stood up in the window-opening, facing the men, the candles behind
her. Gabriel on her right hand, immediately outside the sashframe. Boldwood
had drawn up on her left, within the room. Her singing was soft and rather
tremulous at first, but it soon swelled to a steady clearness. Subsequent
events caused one of the verses to be remembered for many months, and even
years, by more than one of those who were gathered there:
<BLOCKQUOTE>For his bride a soldier sought her,

<P>And a winning tongue had he:

<P>On the banks of Allan Water

<P>None was gay as she!</BLOCKQUOTE>
In addition to the dulcet piping of Gabriel's flute Boldwood supplied a
bass in his customary profound voice, uttering his notes so softly, however,
as to abstain entirely from making anything like an ordinary duet of the
song; they rather formed a rich unexplored shadow, which threw her tones
into relief. The shearers reclined against each other as at suppers in
the early ages of the world, and so silent and absorbed were they that
her breathing could almost be heard between the bars; and at the end of
the ballad, when the last tone loitered on to an inexpressible close, there
arose that buzz of pleasure which is the attar of applause.

<P>It is scarcely necessary to state that Gabriel could not avoid noting
the farmer's bearing tonight towards their entertainer. Yet there was nothing
exceptional in his actions beyond what appertained to his time of performing
them. It was when the rest were all looking away that Boldwood observed
her; when they regarded her he turned aside; when they thanked or praised
he was silent; when they were inattentive he murmured his thanks. The meaning
lay in the difference between actions none of which had any meaning of
itself and the necessity of being jealous, which lovers are troubled with,
did not lead Oak to underestimate these signs.

<P>Bathsheba then wished them good-night, withdrew from the window, and
retired to the back part of the room, Boldwood thereupon closing the sash
and the shutters, and remaining inside with her. Oak wandered away under
the quiet and scented trees. Recovering from the softer impressions produced
by Bathsheba's voice, the shearers rose to leave, Coggan turning to Pennyways
as he pushed back the bench to pass out:

<P>`I like to give praise where praise is due, and the man deserves it
- that`a do so,' he remarked, looking at the worthy thief as if he were
the masterpiece of some world-renowned artist.

<P>`I'm sure I should never have believed it if we hadn't proved it, so
to allude,' hiccupped Joseph Poorgrass, `that every cup, every one of the
best knives and forks, and every empty bottle be in their place as perfect
now as at the beginning, and not one stole at all.'

<P>`I'm sure I don't deserve half the praise you give me,' said the virtuous
thief grimly.

<P>`Well, I'll say this for Pennyways,' added Coggan, `that whenever he
do really make up his mind to do a noble thing in the shape of a good action,
as I could see by his face he did to-night afore sitting down, he's generally
able to carry it out. Yes, I'm proud to say, neighbours, that he's stole
nothing at all.'

<P>`Well, 'tis an honest deed, and we thank ye for it, Pennyways,' said
Joseph; to which opinion the remainder of the company subscribed unanimously.

<P>At this time of departure, when nothing more was visible of the inside
of the parlour than a thin and still chink of light between the shutters,
a passionate scene was in course of enactment there.

<P>Miss Everdene and Boldwood were alone. Her cheeks had lost a great deal
of their healthful fire from the very seriousness of her position; but
her eye was bright with the excitement of a triumph - though it was a triumph
which had rather been contemplated than desired.

<P>She was standing behind a low arm-chair, from which she had just risen,
and he was kneeling in it - inclining himself over its back towards her,
and holding her hand in both her own. His body moved restlessly, and it
was with what Keats daintily calls a too happy happiness. This unwonted
abstraction by love of all dignity from a man of whom it had ever seemed
the chief component, was, in its distressing incongruity, a pain to her
which quenched much of the pleasure she derived from the proof that she
was idolized.

<P>`I will try to love you,' she was saying, in a trembling voice quite
unlike her usual self-confidence. `And if I can believe in any way that
I shall make you a good wife I shall indeed be willing to marry you. But,
Mr Boldwood, hesitation on so high a matter is honourable in any woman,
and I don't want to give a solemn promise tonight. I would, rather ask
you to wait a few weeks till I can see my situation better.'

<P>`But you have every reason to believe that <I>then</I>--'

<P>`I have every reason to hope that at the end of the five or six weeks,
between this time and harvest, that you say you are going to be away from
home, I shall be able to promise to be your wife,' she said firmly. `But
remember this distinctly, I don't promise yet.'

<P>`It is enough; I don't ask more. I can wait on those dear words. And
now, Miss Everdene, good-night!'

<P>`Good-night,' she said graciously - almost tenderly; and Boldwood withdrew
with a serene smile.

<P>Bathsheba knew more of him now; he had entirely bared his heart before
her, even until he had almost worn in her eyes the sorry look of a grand
bird without the feathers that make it grand. She had been awestruck at
her past temerity, and was struggling to make amends without thinking whether
the sin quite deserved the penalty she was schooling herself to pay. To
have brought all this about her ears was terrible; but after a while the
situation was not without a fearful joy. The facility with which even the
most timid women sometimes acquire a relish for the dreadful when that
is amalgamated with a little triumph, is marvellous.
