CHAPTER FORTY-TWO</H1>

<H2>
Joseph and his Burden - Buck's Head</H2>
A wall bounded the site of Casterbridge Union-house, except along a portion
of the end. Here a high gable stood prominent, and it was covered like
the front with a mast of ivy. In this gable was no window, chimney, ornament,
or protuberance of any kind. The single feature appertaining to it, beyond
the expanse of dark green leaves, was a small door.

<P>The situation of the door was peculiar. The sill was three or four feet
above the ground, and for a moment one was at a loss for an explanation
of this exceptional altitude, till ruts immediately beneath suggested that
the door was used solely for the passage of articles and persons to and
from the level of a vehicle standing on the outside. Upon the whole, the
door seemed to advertise itself as a species of Traitor's Gate translated
to another sphere. That entry and exit hereby was only at rare intervals
became apparent on noting that tufts of grass were allowed to flourish
undisturbed in the chinks of the sill.

<P>As the clock over the South-street Alms-house pointed to five minutes
to three, a blue spring waggon, picked out with red, and containing boughs
and flowers, passed the end of the street, and up towards this side of
the building. Whilst the chimes were yet stammering out a shattered form
of `Malbrook', Joseph Poorgrass rang the bell, and received directions
to back his waggon against the high door under the gable. The door then
opened, and a plain elm coffin was slowly thrust forth, and laid by two
men in fustian along the middle of the vehicle.

<P>One of the men then stepped up beside it, took from his pocket a lump
of chalk, and wrote upon the cover the name and a few other words in a
large scrawling hand. (We believe that they do these things more tenderly
now, and provide a plate.) He covered the whole with a black cloth, threadbare,
but decent, the tail-board of the waggon was returned to its place, one
of the men handed a certificate of registry to Poorgrass, and both entered
the door, closing it behind them. Their connection with her, short as it
had been, was over for ever.

<P>Joseph then placed the flowers as enjoined, and the evergreens around,
the flowers, till it was difficult to divine what the waggon contained;
he smacked his whip, and the rather pleasing funeral car crept down the
hill, and along the road to Weatherbury.

<P>The afternoon drew on apace, and, looking to the right towards the sea
as he walked beside the horse, Poorgrass saw strange clouds and scrolls
of mist rolling over the long ridges which girt the landscape in that quarter.
They came in yet greater volumes, and indolently crept across the intervening
valleys, and around the withered papery flags of the moor and river brinks.
Then their dank spongy forms closed in upon the sky. It was a sudden overgrowth
of atmospheric fungi which had their roots in the neighbouring sea, and
by the time that horse, man, and corpse entered Yalbury Great Wood, these
silent workings of on invisible hand had reached them, and they were completely
enveloped, this being the first arrival of the autumn fogs, and the first
fog of the series.

<P>The air was as an eye suddenly struck blind. The waggon and its load
rolled no longer on the horizontal division between clearness and opacity,
but were imbedded in an elastic body of a monotonous pallor throughout.
There was no perceptible motion in the air, not a visible drop of water
fell upon a leaf of the beeches, birches, and firs composing the wood on
either side. The trees stood in an attitude of intentness, as if they waited
longingly for a wind to come and rock them. A startling quiet overhung
all surrounding things - so completely, that the crunching of the waggon-wheels
was as a great noise, and small rustles, which had never obtained a hearing
except by night, were distinctly individualized.

<P>Joseph Poorgrass looked round upon his sad burden as it loomed faintly
through the flowering laurustinus, then at the unfathomable gloom amid
the high trees on each hand, indistinct, shadowless, and spectre-like in
their monochrome of grey. He felt anything but cheerful, and wished he
had the company even of a child or dog. Stopping the horse he listened.
Not a footstep or wheel was audible anywhere around, and the dead silence
was broken only by a heavy particle falling from a tree through the evergreens
and alighting with a smart tap upon the coffin of poor Fanny. The fog by
this time had saturated the trees, and this was the first dropping of water
from the over brimming leaves. The hollow echo of its fall reminded the
waggoner painfully of the grim Leveller. Then hard by came down another
drop, then two or three. Presently there was a continual tapping of these
heavy drops upon the dead leaves, the road, and the travellers. The nearer
boughs were beaded with the mist to the greyness of aged men, and the rusty-red
leaves of the beeches were hung with similar drops, like diamonds on auburn
hair.'

<P>At the roadside hamlet called Roy-Town, just beyond this wood, was the
old inn Buck's Head. It was about a mile and a half from Weatherbury, and
in the meridian times of stage-coach travelling had been the place where
many coaches changed and kept their relays of horses. All the old stabling
was now pulled down, and little remained besides the habitable inn itself,
which, standing a little way back from the road, signified its existence
to people far up and down the highway by a sign hanging from the horizontal
bough of an elm on the opposite side of the way.

<P>Travellers - for the variety <I>tourist</I> had hardly developed into
a distinct species at this date - sometimes said in passing, when they
cast their eyes up to the sign-bearing tree, that artists were fond of
representing the signboard hanging thus, but that they themselves had never
before noticed so perfect an instance in actual working order. It was near
this tree that the waggon was standing into which Gabriel Oak crept on
his first journey to Weatherbury; but, owing to the darkness, the sign
and the inn had been unobserved.

<P>The manners of the inn were of the old-established type. Indeed, in
the midst of its frequenters they existed as unalterable formul&aelig;:
<I>e.g</I>.--
<BLOCKQUOTE>Rap with the bottom of your pint for more liquor.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>For tobacco shout.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>In calling for the girl in waiting, say, Maid!'
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Ditto for the landlady, `Old Soul!', etc., etc.</BLOCKQUOTE>
It was a relief to Joseph's heart when the friendly signboard came in view,
and, stopping his horse immediately beneath it, he proceeded to fulfil
an intention made a long time before. His spirits were oozing out of him
quite. He turned the horse's head to the green bank, and entered the hostel
for a mug of ale.

<P>Going down into the kitchen of the inn, the floor of which was a step
below the passage, which in its turn was a step below the road outside,
what should Joseph see to gladden his eyes but two copper-coloured discs,
in the form of the countenances of Mr Jan Coggan and Mr Mark Clark. These
owners of the two most appreciative throats in the neighbourhood, within
the pale of respectability, were now sitting face to face over a three-legged
circular table, having an iron rim to keep cups and pots from being accidentally
elbowed off they might have been said to resemble the setting sun and the
fill moon shining <I>vis-&agrave;-vis</I> across the globe.

<P>`Why, 'tis neighbour Poorgrass!' said Mark Clark. `I'm sure your face
don't praise your mistress's table, Joseph.'

<P>`I've had a very pale companion for the last four miles,' said Joseph,
indulging in a shudder toned down by resignation. `And to speak the truth,
'twas beginning to tell upon me. I assure ye, I ha'n't seed the colour
of victuals or drink since breakfast time this morning, and that was no
more than a dew-bit afield.'

<P>`Then drink, Joseph, and don't restrain yourself' said Coggan, handing
him a hooped mug three-quarters hill.

<P>Joseph drank for a moderately long time, then for a longer time, saying,
as he lowered the jug. `'Tis pretty drinking - very pretty drinking, and
is more than cheerful on my melancholy errand, so to speak it.'

<P>`True, drink is a pleasant delight,' said Jan, as one who repeated a
truism so familiar to his brain that he hardly noticed its passage over
his tongue; and, lifting the cup, Coggan tilted his head gradually backwards,
with closed eyes, that his expectant soul might not be diverted for one
instant from its bliss by irrelevant surroundings.

<P>`Well, I must be on again,' said Poorgrass. `Not but that I should like
another nip with ye; but the parish might lose confidence in me if I was
seed here.'

<P>`Where be ye trading o't to to-day, then, Joseph?'

<P>`Back to Weatherbury. I've got poor little Fanny Robin in my waggon
outside, and I must be at the churchyard gates at a quarter to five with
her.'

<P>`Ay - I've heard of it. And so she's nailed up in parish boards after
all, and nobody to pay the bell shilling and the grave half-crown.'

<P>`The parish pays the grave half-crown, but not the bell shilling, because
the bell's a luxery: but 'a can hardly do without the grave, poor body.
However, I expect our mistress will pay all.'

<P>`A pretty maid as ever I see! But what's yer hurry, Joseph? The poor
woman's dead, and you can't bring her to life, and you may as well sit
down comfortable, and finish another with us.'

<P>`I don't mind taking just the least thimbleful ye can dream of more
with ye, sonnies. But only a few minutes, because 'tis as 'tis.'

<P>`Of course, you'll have another drop. A man's twice the man afterwards.
You feel so warm and glorious, and you whop and slap at your work without
any trouble, and everything goes on like sticks a-breaking. Too much liquor
is bad, and leads us to that horned man in the smoky house; but after all
many people haven't the gift of enjoying a wet, and since we be highly
favoured with a power that way, we should make the most o't.'

<P>`True,' said Mark Clark. "Tis a talent the lord has mercifully bestowed
upon us, and we ought not to neglect it. But, what with the parsons and
clerks and school-people and serious tea-parties, the merry old ways of
good life have gone to the dogs - upon my carcase, they have!'

<P>`Well, really, I must be onward again now,' said Joseph.

<P>`Now, now, Joseph; nonsense! The poor woman is dead, isn't she, and
what's your hurry?'

<P>`Well, I hope Providence won't be in a way with me for my doings,' said
Joseph, again sitting down. `I've been troubled with weak moment' lately,
'tis true. I've been drinky once this month already and I did not go to
church a-Sunday, and I dropped a curse or two yesterday; so I don't want
to go too far for my safety. Your next world is your next world, and not
to be squandered offhand.'

<P>`I believe ye to be a chapel-member, Joseph. That I do.'

<P>`Oh, no, no! I don't go so far as that.'

<P>`For my part,' said Coggan, `I'm staunch Church of England.'

<P>`Ay, and faith, so be I,' said Mark Clark.

<P>`I won't say much for myself; I don't wish to,' Coggan continued, with
that tendency to talk on principles which is characteristic of the barley-corn.
`But I've never changed a single doctrine: I've stuck like a plaster to
the old faith I was born in. Yes; there's this to be said for the Church,
a man can belong to the Church and bide in his cheerful old inn, and never
trouble or worry his mind about doctrines at all. But to be a meetinger,
you must go to chapel in all winds and weathers, and make yerself as frantic
as a skit Not but that chapel-members be clever chaps enough in their way.
They can lift up beautiful prayers out of their own heads, all about their
families and shipwracks in the newspapers.'

<P>`They can - they can,' said Mark Clark, with corroborative feeling;
`but we Churchmen, you see, must have it all printed aforehand, or, dang
it all, we should no more know what to say to a great gaffer like the lord
than babes unborn.

<P>`Chapel-folk be more hand-in-glove with them above than we,' said Joseph
thoughtfully.

<P>`Yes,' said Coggan. `We know very well that if anybody do go to heaven,
they will. They've worked hard for it, and they deserve to have it, such
as 'tis. I bain't such a fool as to pretend that we who stick to the Church
have the same chances as they, because we know we have not. But I hate
a feller who'll change his old ancient doctrines for the sake of getting
to heaven. I'd as soon turn king's-evidence for the few pounds you get.
Why, neighbours, when every one of my taties were frosted, our Pa'son Thirdly
were the man who gave me a sack for seed, though he hardly had one for
his own use, and no money to buy 'em. If it hadn't been for him, I shouldn't
hae had a tatie to put in my garden. D'ye think I'd turn after that? No,
I'll stick to my side; and if we be in the wrong, so be it: I'll fall with
the fallen!'

<P>`Well said - very well said,' observed Joseph. - `However, folks, I
must be moving now: upon my life I must. Pa'son Thirdly will be waiting
at the church gates, and there's the woman a-biding outside in the waggon.'

<P>`Joseph Poorgrass, don't be so miserable! Pa'son Thirdly won't mind.
He's a generous man; he's found me in tracts for years, and I've consumed
a good many in the course of a long and shady life; but he's never been
the man to cry out at the expense. Sit down.'

<P>The longer Joseph Poorgrass remained, the less his spirit was troubled
by the duties which devolved upon him this afternoon. The minutes glided
by uncounted, until the evening shades began perceptibly to deepen, and
the eyes of the three were but sparkling points on the surface of darkness.
Coggan's repeater struck six from his pocket in the unusual still small
tones.

<P>At that moment hasty steps were heard in the entry, and the door opened
to admit the figure of Gabriel Oak, followed by the maid of the inn bearing
a candle. He stared sternly at the one lengthy and two round faces of the
sitters, which confronted him with the expressions of a fiddle and a couple
of warming-pans. Joseph Poorgrass blinked, and shrank several inches into
the background.

<P>`Upon my soul. I'm ashamed of you; 'tis disgraceful, Joseph, disgraceful!'
said Gabriel indignantly. `Coggan, you call yourself a man, and don't know
better than this.'

<P>Coggan looked up indefinitely at Oak, one or other of his eyes occasionally
opening and closing of its own accord, as if it were not a member, but
a dozy individual with a distinct personality.

<P>`Don't take on so, shepherd!' said Mark Clark, looking reproachfully
at the candle, which appeared to possess special features of interest for
his eyes.

<P>`Nobody can hurt a dead woman,' at length said Coggan, with the precision
of a machine. `All that could be done for her is done - she's beyond us;
and why should a man put himself in a tearing hurry for lifeless clay that
can neither feel nor see, and don't know what you do with her at all? If
she'd been alive, I would have been the first to help her. If she now wanted
victuals and drink, I'd pay for it, money down. But she's dead, and no
speed of ours will bring her to life. The woman's past us - time spent
upon her is throwed away; why should we hurry to do what's not required?
Drink, shepherd, and be friends, for tomorrow we may be like her.'

<P>`We may,' added Mark Clark emphatically, at once drinking himself, to
run no farther risk of losing his chance by the event alluded to, Jan meanwhile
merging his additional thoughts of to-morrow in a song:--
<BLOCKQUOTE>`To-morrow to-morrow!
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And while peace and plen-ty I find at my board,
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With a heart free from sick-ness and sor-row
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>With my friends will I share what to-day may af-ford,
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>And let them spread the table to-morrow
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>To-morrow to-mor--'</BLOCKQUOTE>
`Do hold thy horning, Jan!' said Oak; and turning upon Poorgrass, `as for
you, Joseph, who do your wicked deeds in such confoundedly holy ways, you
are as drunk as you can stand.'

<P>`No, Shepherd Oak, no! Listen to reason, shepherd. All that's the matter
with me is the affliction called a multiplying eye, and that's how it is
I look double to you - I mean, you look double to me.'

<P>`A multiplying eye is a very bad thing,' said Mark Clark.

<P>`It always comes on when I have been in a public-house a little time,'
said Joseph Poorgrass meekly. `Yes; I see two of every sort, as if I were
some holy man living in the times of King Noah and entering into the ark...
Y-y-y-yes,' he added, becoming much affected by the picture of himself
as a person thrown away, and shedding tears; `I feel too good for England:
I ought to have lived in Genesis by rights, like the other men of sacrifice,
and then I shouldn't have b-b-been called a d-d-drunkard in such away!'

<P>`I wish you'd show yourself a man of spirit, and not sit whining there!'

<P>`Show myself a man of spirit?... Ah, well! let me take the name of drunkard
humbly - let me be a man of contrite knees - let it be! I know that I always
do say "Please God" afore I do anything, from my getting up to my going
down of the same, and I be willing to take as much disgrace as there is
in that holy act. Hah, yes!... But not a man of spirit? Have I ever allowed
the toe of pride to be lifted against my hinder parts without groaning
manfully that I question the right to do so! I inquire that query boldly?'

<P>`We can't say that you have, Hero Poorgrass,' admitted Jan.

<P>`Never have I allowed such treatment to pass unquestioned! Yet the shepherd
says in the face of that rich testimony that I be not a man of spirit!
Well, let it pass by, and death is a kind friend!'

<P>Gabriel, seeing that neither of the three was in a fit state to take
charge of the waggon for the remainder of the journey, made no reply, but,
closing the door again upon them, went across to where the vehicle stood,
now getting indistinct in the fog and gloom of this mildewy time. He pulled
the horse's head from the large patch of turf it had eaten bare, readjusted
the boughs over the coffin, and drove along through the unwholesome night.

<P>It had gradually become rumoured in the village that the body to be
brought and buried that day was all that was left of the unfortunate Fanny
Robin who had followed the Eleventh from Casterbridge through Melchester
and onwards. But, thanks to Boldwood's reticence and Oak's generosity,
the lover she had followed had never been individualized as Troy. Gabriel
hoped that the whole truth of the matter might not be published till at
any rate the girl had been in her grave for a few days, when the interposing
barriers of earth and time, and a sense that the events had been somewhat
shut into oblivion, would deaden the sting that revelation and invidious
remark would have for Bathsheba just now.

<P>By the time that Gabriel reached the old manor-house, her residence,
which lay in his way to the church, it was quite dark. A man came from
the gate and said through the fog, which hung between them like blown flour--

<P>`Is that Poorgrass with the corpse?'

<P>Gabriel recognized the voice as that of the parson.

<P>`The corpse is here, sir,' said Gabriel.

<P>`I have just been to inquire of Mrs Troy if she could tell me the reason
of the delay. I am afraid it is too late now for the funeral to be performed
with proper decency. Have you the registrar's certificate?'

<P>`No,' said Gabriel. `I expect Poorgrass has that; and he's at the Buck's
Head. I forgot to ask him for it.'

<P>`Then that settles the matter. We'll put off the funeral till tomorrow
morning. The body may be brought on to the church, or it may be left here
at the farm and fetched by the bearers in the morning. They waited more
than an hour, and have now gone home.'

<P>Gabriel had his reasons for thinking the latter a most objectionable
plan, notwithstanding that Fanny had been an inmate of the farm-house for
several years in the lifetime of Bathsheba's uncle. Visions of several
unhappy contingencies which might arise from this delay flitted before
him. But his will was not law, and he went indoors to inquire of his mistress
what were her wishes on the subject. He found her in an unusual mood: her
eyes as she looked up to him were suspicious and perplexed as with some
antecedent thought. Troy had not yet returned. At first Bathsheba assented
with a mien of indifference to his proposition that they should go on to
the church at once with their burden; but immediately afterwards, following
Gabriel to the gate, she swerved to the extreme of solicitousness on Fanny's
account, and desired that the girl might be brought into the house. Oak
argued upon the convenience of leaving her in the waggon, just as she lay
now, with her flowers and green leaves about her, merely wheeling the vehicle
into the coachhouse till the morning, but to no purpose. `It is unkind
and unchristian,' she said, `to leave the poor thing in a coach-house all
night.'

<P>`Very well, then,' said the parson. `And I will arrange that the funeral
shall take place early tomorrow. Perhaps Mrs Troy is right in feeling that
we cannot treat a dead fellow-creature too thoughtfully. We must remember
that though she may have erred grievously in leaving her home, she is still
our sister; and it is to be believed that God's uncovenanted mercies are
extended towards her, and that she is a member of the flock of Christ.'

<P>The parson's words spread into the heavy air with a sad yet unperturbed
cadence, and Gabriel shed an honest tear. Bathsheba seemed unmoved. Mr
Thirdly then left them, and Gabriel lighted a lantern. Fetching three other
men to assist him, they bore the unconscious truant indoors, placing the
coffin on two benches in the middle of a little sitting-room next the hall,
as Bathsheba directed.

<P>Every one except Gabriel Oak then left the room. He still indecisively
lingered beside the body. He was deeply troubled at the wretchedly ironical
aspect that circumstances were putting on with regard to Troy's wife, and
at his own powerlessness to counteract them. In spite of his careful manoeuvring
all this day, the very worst event that could in any way have happened
in connection with the burial had happened now. Oak imagined a terrible
discovery resulting from this afternoon's work that might cast over Bathsheba's
life a shade which the interposition of many lapsing years might but indifferently
lighten, and which nothing at all might altogether remove.

<P>Suddenly, as in a last attempt to save Bathsheba from, at any rate,
immediate anguish, he looked again, as he had looked before, at the chalk
writing upon the coffin lid. The scrawl was this simple one, `<I>Fanny
Robin and chid</I>'. Gabriel took his handkerchief and carefully rubbed
out the two latter words, leaving visible one inscription `<I>Fanny Robin</I>'
only. He then left the room, and went out quietly by the front door.
