<H2>
Bathsheba talks with her Outrider</H2>
The arrangement for getting back again to Weatherbury had been that Oak
should take the place of Poorgrass in Bathsheba's conveyance and drive
her home, it being discovered late in the afternoon that Joseph was suffering
from his old complaint, a multiplying eye, and was, therefore, hardly trustworthy
as coachman and protector to a woman. But Oak had found himself so occupied,
and was fall of so many cares relative to those portions of Boldwood's
flocks that were not disposed of, that Bathsheba, without telling Oak or
anybody, resolved to drive home herself as she had many times done from
Casterbridge Market, and trust to her good angel for performing the journey
unmolested. But having fallen in with Farmer Boldwood accidentally (on
her part at least) at the refreshment-tent she found it impossible to refuse
his offer to ride on horseback beside her as escort. It had grown twilight
before she was aware, but Boldwood assured her that there was no cause
for uneasiness, as the moon would be up in half an-hour.

<P>Immediately after the incident in the tent she had risen to go - now
absolutely alarmed and really grateful for her old lover's protection -
though regretting Gabriel's absence, whose company she would have much
preferred, as being more proper as well as more pleasant, since he was
her own managing-man and servant. This, however, could not be helped; she
would not, on any consideration, treat Boldwood harshly, having once already
ill-used him, and the moon having risen, and the gig being ready, she drove
across the hill-top in the wending ways which led downwards - to oblivious
obscurity, as it seemed, for the moon and the hill it flooded with light
were in appearance on a level, the rest of the world lying as a vast shady
concave between them. Boldwood mounted his horse, and followed in close
attendance behind. Thus they descended into the lowlands, and the sounds
of those left on the hill came like voices from the sky, and the lights
were as those of a camp in heaven. They soon passed the merry stragglers
in the immediate vicinity of the hill, traversed Kingsbere, and got upon
the high road.

<P>The keen instincts of Bathsheba had perceived that the farmer's staunch
devotion to herself was still undiminished, and she sympathized deeply.
The sight had quite depressed her this evening; had reminded her of her
folly; she wished anew as she had wished many months ago, for some means
of making reparation for her fault. Hence her pity for the man who so persistently
loved on to his own injury and permanent gloom had betrayed Bathsheba into
an injudicious considerateness of manner, which appeared almost like tenderness,
and gave new vigour to the exquisite dream of a Jacob's seven years' service
in poor Boldwood's mind.

<P>He soon found an excuse for advancing from his position in the rear,
and rode close to her side. They had gone two or three miles in the moonlight,
speaking desultorily across the wheel of her gig concerning the fair, farming,
Oak's usefulness to them both, and other indifferent subjects, when Boldwood
said suddenly and simply--

<P>`Mrs Troy, you will marry again some day?'

<P>This point-blank query unmistakably confused her, and it was not till
a minute or more had elapsed that she said, `I have not seriously thought
of any such subject.'

<P>`I quite understand that. Yet your late husband has been dead nearly
one year, and--'

<P>`You forget that his death was never absolutely proved, and may not
have taken place; so that I may not be really a widow,' she said, catching
at the straw of escape that the fact afforded.

<P>`Not absolutely proved, perhaps, but it was proved circumstantially.
A man saw him drowning, too. No reasonable person has any doubt of his
death; nor have you, ma'am, I should imagine.'

<P>`O yes I have, or I should have acted differently,' she said gently.
`From the first I have had a strange unaccountable feeling that he could
not have perished. But I have been able to explain that in several ways
since. Even were I half persuaded that I shall see him no more, I am far
from thinking of marriage with another. I should be very contemptible to
indulge in such a thought.'

<P>They were silent now awhile, and having struck into an unfrequented
track across a common, the creaks of Boldwood's saddle and her gig springs
were all the sounds to be heard. Boldwood ended the pause.

<P>`Do you remember when I carried you fainting in my arms into the King's
Arms, in Casterbridge? Every dog has his day: that was mine.'

<P>`I know - I know it all,' she said, hurriedly.

<P>`I, for one, shall never cease regretting that events so fell out as
to deny you to me.

<P>`I, too, am very sorry,' she said, and then checked herself. `I mean,
you know, I am sorry you thought I--'

<P>`I have always this dreary pleasure in thinking over those past times
with you - that I was something to you before <I>he</I> was anything, and
that you belonged <I>almost</I> to me. But of course, that's nothing. You
never liked me.'

<P>`I did; and respected you, too.'

<P>`Do you now?'

<P>`Yes.'

<P>`Which?'

<P>`How do you mean which?'

<P>`Do you like me, or do you respect me?'

<P>`I don't know - at least, I cannot tell you. It is difficult for a woman
to define her feelings in language which is chiefly made by men to express
theirs. My treatment of you was thoughtless, inexcusable, wicked! I shall
eternally regret it. If there had been anything I could have done to make
amends I would most gladly have done it - there was nothing on earth I
so longed to do as to repair the error. But that was not possible.'

<P>`Don't blame yourself - you were not so far in the wrong as you suppose.
Bathsheba, suppose you had real complete proof that you are what, in fact,
you are - a widow - would you repair the old wrong to me by marrying me?'

<P>`I cannot say. I shouldn't yet, at any rate.'

<P>`But you might at some future time of your life?'

<P>`O yes, I might at some time.'

<P>`Well, then, do you know that without further proof of any kind you
may marry again in about six years from the present - subject to nobody's
objection or blame?'

<P>`O yes,' she said, quickly. `I know all that. But don't talk of it -
seven or six years - where may we all be by that time?'

<P>`They will soon glide by, and it will seem an astonishingly short time
to look back upon when they are past - much less than to look forward to
now.'

<P>`Yes, yes; I have found that in my own experience.'

<P>`Now, listen once more,' Boldwood pleaded. `If I wait that time, will
you marry me? You own that you owe me amends - let that be your way of
making them.'

<P>`But, Mr Boldwood - six years--'

<P>`Do you want to be the wife of any other man?'

<P>`No indeed! I mean, that I don't like to talk about this matter now.
Perhaps it is not proper, and I ought not to allow it. Let us drop it.
My husband may be living, as I said.'

<P>`Of course, I'll drop the subject if you wish. But propriety has nothing
to do with reasons. I am a middle-aged man, willing to protect you for
the remainder of our lives. On your side, at least, there is no passion
or blamable haste - on mine, perhaps, there is. But I can't help seeing
that if you choose from a feeling of pity, and, as you say, a wish to make
amends, to make a bargain with me for a far ahead time - an agreement which
will set all things right and make me happy late though it may be - there
is no fault to be found with you as a woman. Hadn't I the first place beside
you? Haven't you been almost mine once already? Surely you can say to me
as much as this, you will have me back again should circumstances permit?
Now, pray speak! O Bathsheba, promise - it is only a little promise - that
if you marry again, you will marry me!'

<P>His tone was so excited that she almost feared him it this moment, even
whilst she sympathized. It was a simple physical fear - the weak of the
strong; there was no emotional aversion or inner repugnance She said, with
some distress in her voice, for she remembered vividly hid out burst on
the Yalbury Read, and shrank from a repetition of his anger:--

<P>`I will never marry another man whilst you wish me to be your wife,
whatever comes - but to say more - you have taken me so by surprise--'

<P>`But let it stand in these simple words - that in six years' time you
will be my wife? Unexpected accidents we'll not mention, because those,
of course, must be given way to. Now, this time I know you will keep your
word.'

<P>`That's why I hesitate to give it.'

<P>`But do give it! Remember the past, and be kind.'

<P>She breathed; and then said mournfully: `O what shall I do? I don't
love you, and I much fear that I never shall love you as much as a woman
ought to love a husband. If you, sir, know that, and I can yet give you
happiness by a mere promise to marry at the end of six years, if my husband
should not come back, it is a great honour to me. And if you value such
an act of friendship from a woman who doesn't esteem herself as she did,
and has little love left, why I - I will--'

<P>`Promise!'

<P>` - Consider, if I cannot promise soon.'

<P>`But soon is perhaps never?'

<P>`O no, it is not! I mean soon. Christmas, we'll say.'

<P>`Christmas!' He said nothing further till he added: `Well, I'll say
no more to you about it till that time.'

<P>
<HR>

<P>Bathsheba was in a very peculiar state of mind, which showed how entirely
the soul is the slave of the body, the ethereal spirit dependent for its
quality upon the tangible flesh and blood. It is hardly too much to say
that she felt coerced by a force stronger than her own will, not only into
the act of promising upon this singularly remote and vague matter, but
into the emotion of fancying that she ought to promise. When the weeks
intervening between the night of this conversation and Christmas day began
perceptibly to diminish, her anxiety and perplexity increased.

<P>One day she was led by an accident into an oddly confidential dialogue
with Gabriel about her difficulty. It afforded her a little relief - of
a dull and cheerless kind. They were auditing accounts, and something occurred
in the course of their labours which led Oak to say, speaking of Boldwood,
`He'll never forget you, ma'am, never.

<P>Then out came her trouble before she was aware; and she told him how
she had again got into the toils; what Boldwood had asked her, and how
he was expecting her assent. `The most mournful reason of all for my agreeing
to it,' she said sadly, `and the true reason why I think to do so for good
or for evil, is this - it is a thing I have not breathed to a living soul
as yet - I believe that if I don't give my word, he'll go out of his mind.'

<P>`Really, do ye?' said Gabriel, gravely.

<P>`I believe this,' she continued, with reckless frankness; `and Heaven
knows I say it in a spirit the very reverse of vain, for I am grieved and
troubled to my soul about it - I believe I hold that man's future in my
hand. His career depends entirely upon my treatment of him. O Gabriel,
I tremble at my responsibility, for it is terrible.'

<P>`Well, I think this much, ma'am, as I told you years ago,' said Oak,
`that his life is a total blank whenever he isn't hoping for 'ee; but I
can't suppose - I hope that nothing so dreadful hangs on to it as you fancy.
His natural manner has always been dark and strange, you know. But since
the case is so sad and odd-like, why don't ye give the conditional promise?
I think I would.'

<P>`But is it right? Some rash acts of my past life have taught me that
a watched woman must have very much circumspection to retain only a very
little credit, and I do want and long to be discreet in this! And six years
- why we may all be in our graves by that time, even if Mr Troy does not
come back again, which he may not impossibly do! Such thoughts give a sort
of absurdity to the scheme. Now, isn't it preposterous, Gabriel? However
he came to dream of it, I cannot think. But is it wrong? You know - you
are older than I.'

<P>`Eight years older, ma'am.'

<P>`Yes, eight years - and is it wrong?'

<P>`Perhaps it would be an uncommon agreement for a man and woman to make:
I don't see anything really wrong about it,' said Oak, slowly. `In fact
the very thing that makes it doubtful if you ought to marry en under any
condition, that is, your not caring about him - for I may suppose--'

<P>`Yes, you may suppose that love is wanting,' she said shortly. `love
is an utterly bygone, sorry, worn-out, miserable thing with me - for him
or any one else.'

<P>`Well, your want of love seems to me the one thing that takes away harm
from such an agreement with him. If wild heat had to do wi' it, making
ye long to overcome the awkwardness about your husband's vanishing, it
mid be wrong; but a cold-hearted agreement to oblige a man seems different,
somehow. The real sin, ma'am in my mind, lies in thinking of ever wedding
wi' a man you don't love honest and true.'

<P>`That I'm willing to pay the penalty of,' said Bathsheba, firmly. `You
know, Gabriel, this is what I cannot get off my conscience - that I once
seriously injured him in sheer idleness. If I had never played a trick
upon him, he would never have wanted to marry me. O if I could only pay
some heavy damages in money to him for the harm I did, and so get the sin
off my soul that way! Well, there's the debt, which can only be discharged
in one way, and I believe I am bound to do it if it honestly lies in my
power, without any consideration of my own future at all. When a rake gambles
away his expectations, the fact that it is an inconvenient debt doesn't
make him the less liable. I've ben a rake, and the single point I ask you
is, considering that my own scruples, and the fact that in the eye of the
law my husband is only missing, will keep any man from marrying me until
seven years have passed - am I tree to entertain such an idea, even though
'tis a sort of penance - for it will be that! I <I>hate</I> the act of
marriage under such circumstances, and the class of women I should seem
to belong to by doing it!'

<P>`It seems to me that all depends upon whe'r you think, as everybody
else do, that your husband is dead.'

<P>`I shall get to, I suppose, because I cannot help feeling what would
have brought him back long before this time if he had lived.'

<P>`Well, then, in a religious sense you will be as free to <I>think</I>
o' marrying again as any real widow of one year's standing. But why don't
ye ask Mr Thirdly's advice on how to treat Mr Boldwood?'

<P>`No. When I want a broad-minded opinion for general enlightenment, distinct
from special advice, I never go to a man who deals in the subject professionally.
So I like the parson's opinion on law, the lawyer's on doctoring, the doctor's
on business, and my businessman's - that is, yours - on morals.'

<P>`And on love--'

<P>`My own.'

<P>`I'm afraid there's a hitch in that argument,' said Oak, with a grave
smile.

<P>She did not reply at once, and then saying, `Good evening, Mr Oak,'
went away.

<P>She had spoken frankly, and neither asked nor expected any reply from
Gabriel more satisfactory than that she had obtained. Yet in the centremost
parts of her complicated heart there existed at this minute a little pang
of disappointment, for a reason she would not allow herself to recognize.
Oak had not once wished her free that he might marry her himself - had
not once said, `I could wait for you as well as he.' That was the insect
sting. Not that she would have listened to any such hypothesis. O no -
for wasn't she saying all the time that such thoughts of the future were
improper, and wasn't Gabriel far too poor a man to speak sentiment to her?
Yet he might have just hinted about that old love of his, and asked, in
a playful off hand way, if he might speak of it. It would have seemed pretty
and sweet, if no more; and then she would have shown how kind and inoffensive
a woman's `No' can sometimes be. But to give such cool advice - the very
advice she had asked for - it ruffled our heroine all the afternoon.
