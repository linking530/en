<P>NOW the group outside the window had within the last few minutes been
reinforced by new arrivals, some of them respectable shopkeepers and their
assistants, who had come out for a whiff of air after putting up the shutters
for the night; some of them of a lower class. Distinct from either there
appeared a stranger - a young man of remarkably pleasant aspect - who carried
in his hand a carpet-bag of the smart floral pattern prevalent in such
articles at that time.

<P>He was ruddy and of a fair countenance, bright-eyed, and slight in build.
He might possibly have passed by without stopping at all, or at most for
half a minute to glance in at the scene, had not his advent coincided with
the discussion on corn and bread; in which event this history had never
been enacted. But the subject seemed to arrest him, and he whispered some
inquiries of the other bystanders, and remained listening.

<P>When he heard Henchard's closing words, "It can't be done", he smiled
impulsively, drew out his pocket-book, and wrote down a few words by the
aid of the light in the window. He tore out the leaf, folded and directed
it, and seemed about to throw it in through the open sash upon the dining-table;
but, on second thoughts, edged himself through the loiterers, till he reached
the door of the hotel, where one of the waiters who had been serving inside
was now idly leaning against the doorpost.

<P>"Give this to the Mayor at once," he said, handing in his hasty note.

<P>Elizabeth-Jane had seen his movements and heard the words, which attracted
her both by their subject any by their accent - a strange one for those
parts. It was quaint and northerly.

<P>The waiter took the note, while the young stranger continued--

<P>"And can ye tell me of a respectable hotel that's a little more moderate
than this?"

<P>The waiter glanced indifferently up and down the street.

<P>"They say the Three Mariners, just below here, is a very good place,"
he languidly answered; "but I have never stayed there myself."

<P>The Scotchman, as he seemed to be, thanked him, and strolled on in the
direction of the Three Mariners aforesaid, apparently more concerned about
the question of an inn than about the fate of his note, now that the momentary
impulse of writing it was over. While he was disappearing slowly down the
street the waiter left the door, and Elizabeth-Jane saw with some interest
the note brought into the dining-room and handed to the Mayor.

<P>Henchard looked at it carelessly, unfolded it with one hand, and glanced
it through. Thereupon it was curious to not an unexpected effect. The nettled,
clouded aspect which had held possession of his face since the subject
of his corn-dealings had been broached, changed itself into one of arrested
attention. He read the note slowly, and fell into thought, not moody, but
fitfully intense, as that of a man who has been captured by an idea.

<P>By this time toasts and speeches had given place to songs, the wheat
subject being quite forgotten. Men were putting their heads together in
twos and threes, telling good stories, with pantomimic laughter which reached
convulsive grimace. Some were beginning to look as if they did not know
how they had come there, what they had come for, or how they were going
to get home again; and provisionally sat on with a dazed smile. Square-built
men showed a tendency to become hunchbacks; men with a dignified presence
lost it in a curious obliquity of figure, in which their features grew
disarranged and one-sided; whilst the heads of a few who had dined with
extreme thoroughness were somehow sinking into their shoulders, the corners
of their mouth and eyes being bent upwards by the subsidence. Only Henchard
did not conform to these flexuous changes; he remained stately and vertical,
silently thinking.

<P>The clock struck nine. Elizabeth-Jane turned to her companion. "The
evening is drawing on, mother," she said. "What do you propose to do?"

<P>She was surprised to find how irresolute her mother had become. "We
must get a place to lie down in," she murmured. "I have seen - Mr Henchard;
and that's all I wanted to do."

<P>"That's enough for tonight, at any rate," Elizabeth-Jane replied soothingly.
"We can think tomorrow what is best to do about him. The question now is
- is it not? - how shall we find a lodging?"

<P>As her mother did not reply Elizabeth-Jane's mind reverted to the words
of the waiter, that the Three Mariners was an inn of moderate charges.
A recommendation good for one person was probably good for another. "Let's
go where the young man has gone to," she said. "He is respectable. What
do you say?"

<P>Her mother assented, and down the street they went.

<P>In the meantime the Mayor's thoughtfulness, engendered by the note as
stated, continued to hold him in abstraction; till, whispering to his neighbour
to take his place, he found opportunity to leave the chair. This was just
after the departure of his wife and Elizabeth.

<P>Outside the door of the assembly-room he saw the waiter, and beckoning
to him asked who brought the note which had been handed in a quarter of
an hour before.

<P>"A young man, sir - a sort of traveller. He was a Scotchman seemingly."

<P>"Did he say how he had got it?"

<P>"He wrote it himself, sir, as he stood outside the window."

<P>"Oh - wrote it himself... Is the young man in the hotel?"

<P>"No, sir. He went to the Three Mariners, I believe."

<P>The Mayor walked up and down the vestibule of the hotel with his hands
under his coat tails, as if he were merely seeking a cooler atmosphere
than that of the room he had quitted. But there could be no doubt that
he was in reality still possessed to the full by the new idea, whatever
that might be. At length he went back to the door of the dining-room, paused,
and found that the songs, toasts, and conversation were proceeding quite
satisfactorily without his presence. The Corporation, private residents,
and major and minor tradesmen had, in fact, gone in for comforting beverages
to such an extent that they had quite forgotten, not only the Mayor, but
all those vast political, religious, and social differences which they
felt necessary to maintain in the daytime, and which separated them like
iron grills. Seeing this the Mayor took his hat, and when the waiter had
helped him on with a thin holland overcoat, went out and stood under the
portico.

<P>Very few persons were now in the street; and his eyes, by a sort of
attraction, turned and dwelt upon a spot about a hundred yards further
down. It was the house to which the writer of the note had gone - the Three
Mariners - whose two prominent Elizabethan gables, bow-window, and passage-light
could be seen from where he stood. Having kept his eyes on it for a while
he strolled in that direction.

<P>This ancient house of accommodation for man and beast, now, unfortunately,
pulled down, was built of mellow sandstone, with mullioned windows of the
same material, markedly out of perpendicular from the settlement of foundations.
The bay window projecting into the street, whose interior was so popular
among the frequenters of the inn, was closed with shutters, in each of
which appeared a heart-shaped aperture, somewhat more attenuated in the
right and left ventricles than is seen in Nature. Inside these illuminated
holes, at a distance of about three inches, were ranged at this hour, as
every passer knew, the ruddy polls of Billy Wills the glazier, Smart the
shoe-maker, Buzzford the general dealer, and others of a secondary set
of worthies, of a grade somewhat below that of the diners of the King's
Arms, each with his yard of clay.

<P>A four-centred Tudor arch was over the entrance, and over the arch the
signboard, now visible in the rays of an opposite lamp. Hereon the Mariners,
who had been represented by the artist as persons of two dimensions only
- in other words, flat as a shadow - were standing in a row in paralysed
attitudes. Being on the sunny side of the street the three comrades had
suffered largely from warping, splitting, fading, and shrinkage, so that
they were but a half-invisible film upon the reality of the grain, and
knots, and nails, which composed the signboard. As a matter of fact, this
state of things was not so much owing to Stannidge the landlord's neglect,
as from the lack of a painter in Casterbridge who would undertake to reproduce
the features of men so traditional.

<P>A long, narrow dimly-lit passage gave access to the inn, within which
passage the horses going to their stalls at the back, and the coming and
departing human guests, rubbed shoulders indiscriminately, the latter running
no slight risk of having their toes trodden upon by the animals. The good
stabling and the good ale of the Mariners, thought somewhat difficult to
reach on account of there being but this narrow way to both, were nevertheless
perserveringly sought out by the sagacious old heads who knew what was
what in Casterbridge.

<P>Henchard stood without the inn for a few instants; then lowering the
dignity of his presence as much as possible by buttoning the brown holland
coat over his shirt-front, and in other ways toning himself down to his
ordinary everyday appearance, he entered the inn door.
