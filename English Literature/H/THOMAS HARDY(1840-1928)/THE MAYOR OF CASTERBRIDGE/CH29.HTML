<P>AT this hour Lucetta was bounding along the road to Port-Bredy just
as Elizabeth had announced. That she had chosen for her afternoon walk
the road along which she had returned to Casterbridge three hours earlier
in a carriage was curious - if anything should be called curious in concatenations
of phenomena wherein each is known to have its accounting cause. It was
the day of the chief market - Saturday - and Farfrae for once had been
missed from his corn-stand in the dealers' room. Nevertheless, it was known
that he would be home that night - "for Sunday", as Casterbridge expressed
it.

<P>Lucetta, in continuing her walk, had at length reached the end of the
ranked trees which bordered the highway in this and other directions out
of the town. This end marked a mile; and here she stopped.

<P>The spot was a vale between two gentle acclivities, and the road, still
adhering to its Roman foundation, stretched onward straight as a surveyor's
line till lost to sight on the most distant ridge. There was neither hedge
nor tree in the prospect now, the road clinging to the stubbly expanse
of corn-land like a stripe to an undulating garment. Near her was a barn
- the single building of any kind within her horizon.

<P>She strained her eyes up the lessening road, but nothing appeared thereon
- not so much as a speck. She sighed one word - "Donald!" and turned her
face to the town for retreat.

<P>Here the case was different. A single figure was approaching her - Elizabeth-Jane's.

<P>Lucetta, in spite of her loneliness, seemed a little vexed. Elizabeth's
face, as soon as she recognized her friend, shaped itself into affectionate
lines while yet beyond speaking distance. "I suddenly thought I would come
and meet you," she said, smiling.

<P>Lucetta's reply was taken from her lips by an unexpected diversion.
A by-road on her right hand descended from the fields into the highway
at the point where she stood, and down the track a bull was rambling uncertainly
towards her and Elizabeth, who, facing the other way, did not observe him.

<P>In the latter quarter of each year cattle were at once the mainstay
and the terror of families about Casterbridge and its neighbourhood, where
breeding was carried on with Abrahamic success. The head of stock driven
into and out of the town at this season to be sold by the local auctioneer
was very large; and all these horned beasts, in travelling to and fro,
sent women and children to shelter as nothing else could do. In the main
the animals would have walked along quietly enough; but the Casterbridge
tradition was that to drive stock it was indispensable that hideous cries,
coupled with Yahoo antics and gestures, should be used, large sticks flourished,
stray dogs called in, and in general everything done that was likely to
infuriate the viciously disposed and terrify the mild. Nothing was commoner
than for a householder on going out of his parlour to find his hall or
passage full of little children, nurse-maids, aged women, or a ladies'
school, who apologized for their presence by saying, "A bull passing down
street from the sale."

<P>Lucetta and Elizabeth regarded the animal in doubt, he meanwhile drawing
vaguely towards them. It was a large specimen of the breed, in colour rich
dun, though disfigured at present by splotches of mud about his seamy sides.
His horns were thick and tipped with brass; his two nostrils like the Thames
Tunnel as seen in the perspective toys of yore. Between them, through the
gristle of his nose, was a stout copper ring, welded on, and irremovable
as Gurth's collar of brass. To the ring was attached an ash staff about
a yard long, which the bull with the motions of his head flung about like
a flail.

<P>It was not till they observed this dangling stick that the young women
were really alarmed; for it revealed to them that the bull was an old one,
too savage to be driven, which had in some way escaped, the staff being
the means by which the drover controlled him and kept his horns at arms'
length.

<P>They looked round for some shelter or hiding-place, and thought of the
barn hard by. As long as they had kept their eyes on the bull he had shown
some deference in his manner of approach; but no sooner did they turn their
backs to seek the barn than he tossed his head and decided to thoroughly
terrify them. This caused the two helpless girls to run wildly, whereupon
the bull advanced in a deliberate charge.

<P>The barn stood behind a green slimy pond, and it was closed save as
to one of the usual pair of doors facing them, which had been propped open
by a hurdle-stake, and for this opening they made. The interior had been
cleared by a recent bout of threshing except at one end, where there was
a stack of dry clover. Elizabeth-Jane took in the situation. "We must climb
up there," she said.

<P>But before they had even approached it they heard the bull scampering
through the pond without, and in a second he dashed into the barn, knocking
down the hurdle-stake in passing; the heavy door slammed behind him; and
all three were imprisoned in the barn together. The mistaken creature saw
them, and stalked towards the end of the barn into which they had fled.
The girls doubled so adroitly that their pursuer was against the wall when
the fugitives were already half way to the other end. By the time that
his length would allow him to turn and follow them thither they had crossed
over; thus the pursuit went on, the hot air from his nostrils blowing over
them like a sirocco, and not a moment being attainable by Elizabeth or
Lucetta in which to open the door. What might have happened had their situation
continued cannot be said; but in a few moments a rattling of the door distracted
their adversary's attention, and a man appeared. He ran forward towards
the leading-staff, seized it, and wrenched the animal's head as if he would
snap it off. The wrench was in reality so violent that the thick neck seemed
to have lost its stiffness and to become half-paralysed, whilst the nose
dropped blood. The premeditated human contrivance of the nose-ring was
too cunning for impulsive brute force, and the creature flinched.

<P>The man was seen in the partial gloom to be large-framed and unhesitating.
He led the bull to the door, and the light revealed Henchard. He made the
bull fast without, and reentered to the succour of Lucetta; for he had
not perceived Elizabeth, who had climbed onto the clover-heap. Lucetta
was hysterical, and Henchard took her in his arms and carried her to the
door.

<P>"You - have saved me!" she cried, as soon as she could speak.

<P>"I have returned your kindness," he responded tenderly. "You once saved
me."

<P>"How - comes it to be you - you?" she asked, not heeding his reply.

<P>"I came out here to look for you. I have been wanting to tell you something
these two or three days; but you have been away, and I could not. Perhaps
you cannot talk now?"

<P>"Oh - no! Where is Elizabeth?"

<P>"Here am I!" cried the missing one cheerfully; and without waiting for
the ladder to be placed she slid down the face of the clover-stack to the
floor.

<P>Henchard supporting Lucetta on one side, and Elizabeth-Jane on the other,
they went slowly along the rising road. They had reached the top and were
descending again when Lucetta, now much recovered, recollected that she
had dropped her muff in the barn.

<P>"I'll run back," said Elizabeth-Jane. "I don't mind it at all, as I
am not tired as you are." She thereupon hastened down again to the barn,
the others pursuing their way.

<P>Elizabeth soon found the muff, such an article being by no means small
at that time. Coming out she paused to look for a moment at the bull, now
rather to be pitied with his bleeding nose, having perhaps rather intended
a practical joke than a murder. Henchard had secured him by jamming the
staff into the hinge of the barn-door, and wedging it there with a stake.
At length she turned to hasten onward after her contemplation, when she
saw a green-and-black gig approaching from the contrary direction, the
vehicle being driven by Farfrae.

<P>His presence here seemed to explain Lucetta's walk that way. Donald
saw her, drew up, and was hastily made acquainted with what had occurred.
At Elizabeth-Jane mentioning how greatly Lucetta had been jeopardized,
he exhibited an agitation different in kind no less than in intensity from
any she had seen in him before. He became so absorbed in the circumstances
that he scarcely had sufficient knowledge of what he was doing to think
of helping her up beside him.

<P>"She has gone on with Mr Henchard, you say?" he inquired at last.

<P>"Yes. He is taking her home. They are almost there by this time."

<P>"And you are sure she can get home?"

<P>Elizabeth-Jane was quite sure.

<P>"Your stepfather saved her?"

<P>"Entirely."

<P>Farfrae checked his horse's pace; she guessed why. He was thinking that
it would be best not to intrude on the other two just now. Henchard had
saved Lucetta, and to provoke a possible exhibition of her deeper affection
for himself was as ungenerous as it was unwise.

<P>The immediate subject of their talk being exhausted she felt more embarrassed
at sitting thus beside her past lover; but soon the two figures of the
others were visible at the entrance to the town. The face of the woman
was frequently turned back, but Farfrae did not whip on the horse. When
these reached the town walls Henchard and his companion had disappeared
down the street; Farfrae set down Elizabeth-Jane on her expressing a particular
wish to alight there, and drove round to the stables at the back of his
lodgings.

<P>On this account he entered the house through his garden, and going up
to his apartments found them in a particularly disturbed state, his boxes
being hauled out upon the landing, and his bookcase standing in three pieces.
These phenomena, however, seemed to cause him not the least surprise. "When
will everything be sent up?" he said to the mistress of the house, who
was superintending.

<P>"I am afraid not before eight, sir," said she. "You see we wasn't aware
till this morning that you were going to move, or we could have been forwarder."

<P>"A - well, never mind, never mind!" said Farfrae cheerily. "Eight o'clock
will do well enough if it be not later. Now, don't ye be standing here
talking, or it will be twelve, I doubt." Thus speaking he went out by the
front door and up the street.

<P>During this interval Henchard and Lucetta had had experiences of a different
kind. After Elizabeth's departure for the muff the corn-merchant opened
himself frankly, holding her hand within his arm, though she would fain
have withdrawn it. "Dear Lucetta, I have been very, very anxious to see
you these two or three days," he said; "ever since I saw you last!I have
thought over the way I got your promise that night. You said to me, ""If
I were a man I should not insist."" That cut me deep. I felt that there
was some truth in it. I don't want to make you wretched; and to marry me
just now would do that as nothing else could - it is but too plain. Therefore
I agree to an indefinite engagement - to put off all thought of marriage
for a year or two."

<P>"But - but - can I do nothing of a different kind?" said Lucetta. "I
am full of gratitude to you - you have saved my life. And your care of
me is like coals of fire on my head! I am a monied person now. Surely I
can do something in return for your goodness - something practical?"

<P>Henchard remained in thought. He had evidently not expected this. "There
is one thing you might do, Lucetta," he said. "But not exactly of that
kind."

<P>"Then of what kind is it?" she asked with renewed misgiving.

<P>"I must tell you a secret to ask it. - You may have heard that I have
been unlucky this Year? I did what I have never done before - speculated
rashly; and I lost. That's just put me in a strait."

<P>"And you would wish me to advance some money?"

<P>"No, no!" said Henchard, almost in anger. "I'm not the man to sponge
on a woman, even though she may be so nearly my own as you. No, Lucetta;
what you can do is this; and it would save me. My great creditor is Grower,
and it is at his hands I shall suffer if at anybody's; while a fortnight's
forbearance on his part would be enough to allow me to pull through. This
may be got out of him in one way - that you would let it be known to him
that you are my intended - that we are to be quietly married in the next
fortnight. - Now stop, you haven't heard all! Let him have this story,
without, of course, any prejudice to the fact that the actual engagement
between us is to be a long one. Nobody else need know: you could go with
me to Mr Grower and just let me speak to 'ee before him as if we were on
such terms. We'll ask him to keep it secret. He will willingly wait then.
At the fortnight's end I shall be able to face him; and I can coolly tell
him all is postponed between us for a year or two. Not a soul in the town
need know how you've helped me. Since you wish to be of use, there's your
way."

<P>It being now what the people called the "pinking in" of the day, that
is the quarter-hour just before dusk, he did not at first observe the result
of his own words upon her.

<P>"If it were anything else," she began, and the dryness of her lips was
represented in her voice.

<P>"But it is such a little thing!" he said, with a deep reproach. "Less
than you have offered - just the beginning of what you have so lately promised!
I could have told him as much myself, but he would not have believed me."

<P>"It is not because I won't - it is because I absolutely can't," she
said, with rising distress.

<P>"You are provoking!" he burst out. "It is enough to make me force you
to carry out at once what you have promised."

<P>"I cannot!" she insisted desperately.

<P>"Why? When I have only within these few minutes released you from your
promise to do the thing off-hand."

<P>"Because - he was a witness!"

<P>"Witness? Of what?"

<P>"If I must tell you - . Don't, don't upbraid me!"

<P>"Well! Let's hear what you mean?"

<P>"Witness of my marriage - Mr Grower was!"

<P>"Marriage?"

<P>"Yes. With Mr Farfrae. O Michael! I am already his wife. We were married
this week at Port-Bredy. There were reasons against our doing it here.
Mr Grower was a witness because he happened to be at Port-Bredy at the
time."

<P>Henchard stood as if idiotized. She was so alarmed at his silence that
she murmured something about lending him sufficient money to tide over
the perilous fortnight.

<P>"Married him?" said Henchard at length. "My good - what, married him
whilst - bound to marry me?"

<P>"It was like this," she explained, with tears in her eyes and quavers
in her voice; "don't - don't be cruel! I loved him so much, and I thought
you might tell him of the past - and that grieved me! And then, when I
had promised you, I learnt of the rumour that you had - sold your first
wife at a fair like a horse or cow! How could I keep my promise after hearing
that? I could not risk myself in your hands; it would have been letting
myself down to take your name after such a scandal. But I knew I should
lose Donald if I did not secure him at once - for you would carry out your
threat of telling him of our former acquaintance, as long as there was
a chance of keeping me for yourself by doing so. But you will not do so
now, will you, Michael? for it is too late to separate us."

<P>The notes of St Peter's bells in full peal had been wafted to them while
she spoke; and now the genial thumping of the town band, renowned for its
unstinted use of the drum-stick, throbbed down the street.

<P>"Then this racket they are making is on account of it, I suppose?" said
he.

<P>"Yes - I think he has told them, or else Mr Grower has... May I leave
you now? My - he was detained at Port-Bredy today, and sent me on a few
hours before him."

<P>"Then it is <I>his wife's</I> life I have saved this afternoon."

<P>"Yes - and he will be for ever grateful to you."

<P>"I am much obliged to him... O you false woman!" burst from Henchard.
"You promised me!"

<P>"Yes, yes! But it was under compulsion, and I did not know all your
past - "

<P>"And now I've a mind to punish you as you deserve! One word to this
bran-new husband of how you courted me, and your precious happiness is
blown to atoms!"

<P>"Michael - pity me, and be generous!"

<P>"You don't deserve pity! You did; but you don't now."

<P>"I'll help you to pay off your debt."

<P>"A pensioner of Farfrae's wife - not I! Don't stay with me longer -
I shall say something worse. Go home!"

<P>She disappeared under the trees of the south walk as the band came round
the corner, awaking the echoes of every stock and stone in celebration
of her happiness. Lucetta took no heed, but ran up the back street and
reached her own home unperceived.
