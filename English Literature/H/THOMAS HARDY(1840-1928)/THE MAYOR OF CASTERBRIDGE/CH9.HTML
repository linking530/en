<P>WHEN Elizabeth-Jane opened the hinged casement next morning the mellow
air brought in the feel of imminent autumn almost as distinctly as if she
had been in the remotest hamlet. Casterbridge was the complement of the
rural life around; not its urban opposite. Bees and butterflies in the
cornfields at the top of the town, who desired to get to the meads at the
bottom, took no circuitous course, but flew straight down High Street without
any apparent consciousness that they were traversing strange latitudes.
And in autumn airy spheres of thistledown floated into the same street,
lodged upon the shop fronts, blew into drains, and innumerable tawny and
yellow leaves skimmed along the pavement, and stole through people's doorways
into their passages with a hesitating scratch on the floor, like the skirts
of timid visitors.

<P>Hearings voices, one of which was close at hand, she withdrew her head
and glanced from behind the window-curtains. Mr Henchard - now habited
no longer as a great personage, but as a thriving man of business - was
pausing on his way up the middle of the street, and the Scotchman was looking
from the window adjoining her own. Henchard, it appeared, had gone a little
way past the inn before he had noticed his acquaintance of the previous
evening. He came back a few steps, Donald Farfrae opening the window further.

<P>``And you are off soon, I suppose?'' said Henchard upwards.

<P>``Yes - almost this moment, sir,'' said the other. ``Maybe I'll walk
on till the coach makes up on me.''

<P>``Which way?''

<P>``The way ye are going.''

<P>``Then shall we walk together to the top o' town?''

<P>``If ye'll wait a minute,'' said the Scotchman.

<P>In a few minutes the latter emerged, bag in hand. Henchard looked at
the bag as at an enemy. It showed there was no mistake about the young
man's departure. ``Ah, my lad,'' he said, ``you should have been a wise
man, and have stayed with me.''

<P>``Yes, yes - it might have been wiser,'' said Donald, looking microscopically
at the houses that were furthest off. ``It is only telling ye the truth
when I say my plans are vague.''

<P>They had by this time passed on from the precincts of the inn) and Elizabeth-Jane
heard no more. She saw that they continued in conversation, Henchard turning
to the other occasionally, and emphasizing some remark with a gesture.
Thus they passed the King's Arms Hotel, the Market House, St Peter's churchyard
wall, ascending to the upper end of the long street till they were small
as two grains of corn; when they bent suddenly to the right into the Bristol
Road, and were out of view.

<P>``He was a good man - and he's gone,'' she said to herself. ``I was
nothing to him, and there was no reason why he should have wished me good-bye.''

<P>The simple thought, with its latent sense of slight, had moulded itself
out of the following little fact: when the Scotchman came out at the door
he had by accident glanced up at her; and then he had looked away again
without nodding, or smiling, or saying a word.

<P>``You are still thinking, mother,'' she said, when she turned inwards.

<P>``Yes; I am thinking of Mr Henchard's sudden liking for that young man.
He was always so. Now, surely, if he takes so warmly to people who are
not related to him at all, may he not take as warmly to his own kin?''

<P>While they debated this question a procession of five large waggons
went past, laden with hay up to the bedroom windows. They came in from
the country, and the steaming horses had probably been travelling a great
part of the night. To the shaft of each hung a little broad, on which was
painted in white letters, ``Henchard, cornfactor and hay-merchants''. The
spectacle renewed his wife's conviction that, for her daughter's sake,
she should strain a point to rejoin him.

<P>The discussion was continued during breakfast, and the end of it was
that Mrs Henchard decided, for good or for ill, to send Elizabeth-Jane
with a message to Henchard, to the effect that his relative Susan, a sailor's
widow, was in the town; leaving it to him to say whether or not he would
recognize her. What had brought her to this determination were chiefly
two things. He had been described as a lonely widower; and he had expressed
shame for a past transaction of his life. There was promise in both.

<P>``If he says no,'' she enjoined, as Elizabeth-Jane stood, bonnet on,
ready to depart; ``if he thinks it does not become the good position he
has reached to in the town, to own - to let us call on him as - his distant
kinsfolk, say, ""Then, sir, we would rather not intrude; we will leave
Casterbridge as quietly as we have come, and go back to our own country.""...
I almost feel that I would rather he did say so, as I have not seen him
for so many years, and we are so - little allied to him!''

<P>``And if he say yes?'' inquired the more sanguine one.

<P>``In that case,'' answered Mrs Henchard cautiously, ``ask him to write
me a note, saying when and how he will see us - or<I>me</I>.''

<P>Elizabeth-Jane went a few steps towards the landing. ``And tell him,''
continued her mother, ``that I fully know I have no claim upon him - that
I am glad to find he is thriving; that I hope his life may be long and
happy - there, go.'' Thus with a half-hearted willingness, a smothered
reluctance, did the poor forgiving woman start her unconscious daughter
on this errand.

<P>It was about ten o'clock, and market-day, when Elizabeth paced up the
High Street, in no great hurry; for to herself her position was only that
of a poor relation deputed to hunt up a rich one. The front doors of the
private houses were mostly left open at this warm autumn time, no thought
of umbrella stealers disturbing the minds of the placid burgesses. Hence,
through the long, straight, entrance passages thus unclosed could be seen,
as through tunnels, the mossy gardens at the back, glowing with nasturtiums,
fuchsias, scarlet geraniums, ``bloody warriors'', snapdragons, and dahlias,
this floral blaze being backed by crusted grey stone-work remaining from
a yet remoter Casterbridge than the venerable one visible in the street.
The old-fashioned fronts of these houses, which had older than old-fashioned
backs, rose sheer from the pavement, into which the bow-windows protruded
like bastions, necessitating a pleasing<I>chassez-d&eacute;chassez</I>
movement to the timepressed pedestrian at every few yards. He was bound
also to evolve other Terpsichorean figures in respect of door-steps, scrapers,
cellar-hatches, church buttresses. and the overhanging angles of walls
which, originally unobtrusive, had become bow-legged and knock-kneed.

<P>In addition to these fixed obstacles which spoke so cheerfully of individual
unrestraint as to boundaries, movables occupied the path and roadway to
a perplexing extent. First the vans of the carriers in and out of Casterbridge,
who hailed from Mellstock, Weatherbury, The Hintocks, Shertonabbas, Kingsbere,
Overcombe, and many other towns and villages round. Their owners were numerous
enough to be regarded as a tribe, and had almost distinctiveness enough
to be regarded as a race. Their vans had just arrived, and were drawn up
on each side of the street in close file, so as to form at places a wall
between the pavement and the roadway. Moreover every shop pitched out half
of its contents upon trestles and boxes on the kerb, extending the display
each week a little further and further into the roadway, despite the expostulations
of the two feeble old constables, until there remained but a tortuous defile
for carriages down the centre of the street, which afforded fine opportunities
for skill with the reins. Over the pavement on the sunny side of the way
hung shopblinds so constructed as to give the passenger's hat a smart buffet
off his head, as from the unseen hands of Cranstoun's Goblin Page, celebrated
in romantic lore.

<P>Horses for sale were tied in rows, their forelegs on the pavement, their
hind legs in the street, in which position they occasionally nipped little
boys by the shoulder who were passing to school. And any inviting recess
in front of a house that had been modestly kept back from the general line
was utilized by pig-dealers as a pen for their stock.
