<P>NEXT morning, accordingly, she rose at five o'clock and went into the
street. It was not yet light; a dense fog prevailed, and the town was as
silent as it was dark, except that from the rectangular avenues which framed
in the borough there came a chorus of tiny rappings, caused by the fall
of water-drops condensed on the boughs; now it was wafted from the West
Walk, now from the South Walk; and then from both quarters simultaneously.
She moved on to the bottom of Corn Street, and, knowing his time well,
waited only a few minutes before she heard the familiar bang of his door,
and then his quick walk towards her. She met him at the point where the
last tree of the engirding avenue flanked the last house in the street.

<P>He could hardly discern her till, glancing inquiringly, he said, "What
- Miss Henchard - and are ye up so airly?"

<P>She asked him to pardon her for waylaying him at such an unseemly time.
"But I am anxious to mention something," she said. "And I wished not to
alarm Mrs Farfrae by calling."

<P>"Yes?" said he, with the cheeriness of a superior. "And what may it
be? It's very kind of ye, I'm sure."

<P>She now felt the difficulty of conveying to his mind the exact aspect
of possibilities in her own. But she somehow began, and introduced Henchard's
name, "I sometimes fear," she said with an effort, "that he may be betrayed
into some attempt to - insult you, sir."

<P>"But we are the best of friends?"

<P>"Or to play some practical joke upon you, sir. Remember that he has
been hardly used."

<P>"But we are quite friendly?"

<P>"Or to do something - that would injure you - hurt you - wound you."
Every word cost her twice its length of pain. And she could see that Farfrae
was still incredulous. Henchard, a poor man in his employ, was not to Farfrae's
view the Henchard who had ruled him. Yet he was not only the same man,
but that man with his sinister qualities, formerly latent, quickened into
life by his buffetings.

<P>Farfrae, happy, and thinking no evil, persisted in making light of her
fears. Thus they parted, and she went homeward, journeymen now being in
the street, waggoners going to the harness-makers for articles left to
be repaired, farm-horses going to the shoeing-smiths, and the sons of labour
showing themselves generally on the move. Elizabeth entered her lodging
unhappily, thinking she had done no good, and only made herself appear
foolish by her weak note of warning.

<P>But Donald Farfrae was one of the those men upon whom an incident is
never absolutely lost. He revised impressions from a subsequent point of
view, and the impulsive judgement of the moment was not always his permanent
one. The vision of Elizabeth's earnest face in the rimy dawn came back
to him several times during the day. Knowing the solidity of her character
he did not treat her hints altogether as idle sounds.

<P>But he did not desist from a kindly scheme on Henchard's account that
engaged him just then; and when he met Lawyer Joyce, the town-clerk, later
in the day, he spoke of it as if nothing had occurred to damp it.

<P>"About that little seedsman's shop," he said; "the shop over-looking
the churchyard, which is to let. It is not for myself I want it, but for
our unlucky fellow-townsman Henchard. It would be a new beginning for him,
if a small one; and I have told the Council that I would head a private
subscription among them to set him up in it - that I would be fifty pounds,
if they would make up the other fifty among them."

<P>"Yes, yes; so I've heard; and there's nothing to say against it for
that matter," the town-clerk replied, in his plain, frank way. "But, Farfrae,
others see what you don't. Henchard hates 'ee - ay, hates 'ee; and 'tis
right that you should know it. To my knowledge he was at the Three Mariners
last night, saying in public that about you which a man ought not to say
about another."

<P>"Is that so - ah, is that so?" said Farfrae, looking down. "Why should
he do it?" added the young man bitterly; "what harm have I done him that
he should try to wrong me?"

<P>"God only knows," said Joyce, lifting his eyebrows. "It shows much long-suffering
in you to put up with him, and keep him in your employ."

<P>"But I cannet discharge a man who was once a good friend to me? How
can I forget that when I came here 'twas he enabled me to make a footing
for mysel'? No, no. As long as I've a day's wark to offer he shall do it
if he chooses. `Tis not I who will deny him such a little as that. But
I'll drop the idea of establishing him in a shop till I can think more
about it."

<P>It grieved Farfrae much to give up this scheme. But a damp having been
thrown over it by these and other voices in the air, he went and countermanded
his orders. The then occupier of the shop was in it when Farfrae spoke
to him, and feeling it necessary to give some explanation of his withdrawal
from the negotiation Donald mentioned Henchard's name, and stated that
the intentions of the Council had been changed.

<P>The occupier was much disappointed, and straightaway informed Henchard,
as soon as he saw him, that a scheme of the Council for setting him up
in a shop had been knocked on the head by Farfrae. And thus out of error
enmity grew.

<P>When Farfrae got indoors that evening that the tea-kettle was singing
on the high hob of the semi-egg-shaped grate. Lucetta, light as a sylph,
ran forward and seized his hands, where-upon Farfrae duly kissed her.

<P>"Oh!" she cried playfully, turning to the window. "See - the blinds
are not drawn down, and the people can look in - what a scandal!"

<P>When the candles were lighted, the curtains drawn, and the twain sat
at tea, she noticed that he looked serious. Without directly inquiring
why she let her eyes linger solicitously on his face.

<P>"Who has called?" he absently asked. "Any folk for me?"

<P>"No," said Lucetta. "What's the matter, Donald?"

<P>"Well - nothing worth talking of," he responded sadly.

<P>"Then, never mind it. You will get through it. Scotchmen are always
lucky."

<P>"No - not always!" he said, shaking his head gloomily as he contemplated
a crumb on the table. "I know many who have not been so! There was Sandy
Macfarlane, who started to America to try his fortune, and he was drowned;
and Archibald Leith, he was murdered! And poor Willie Dunbleeze and Maitland
Macfreeze - they fell into bad courses, and went the way of all such!"

<P>"Why - you old goosey - I was only speaking in a general sense, of course!
You are always so literal. Now when we have finished tea, sing me that
funny song about high-heeled shoon and siller tags, and the one-and-forty
wooers."

<P>"No, no. I couldna sing tonight! It's Henchard - he hates me; so that
I may not be his friend if I would. I would understand why there should
be a wee bit envy; but I cannet see a reason for the whole intensity of
what he feels. Now, can you, Lucetta? It is more like old-fashioned rivalry
in love than just a bit of rivalry in trade."

<P>Lucetta had grown somewhat wan. "No," she replied.

<P>"I give him employment - I cannet refuse it. But neither can I blind
myself to the fact that with a man of passions such as his, there is no
safeguard for conduct!"

<P>"What have you heard - O Donald, dearest?" said Lucetta in alarm. The
words on her lips were "anything about me?" - but she did not utter them.
She could not, however, suppress her agitation, and her eyes filled with
tears.

<P>"No, no - it is not so serious as ye fancy," declared Farfrae soothingly;
though he did not know its seriousness so well as she.

<P>"I wish you would do what we have talked of," mournfully remarked Lucetta.
"Give up business, and go away from here. We have plenty of money, and
why should we stay?"

<P>Farfrae seemed seriously disposed to discuss this move, and they talked
thereon till a visitor was announced. Their neighbour Alderman Vatt came
in.

<P>"You've heard, I suppose, of poor Doctor Chalkfield's death? Yes - died
this afternoon at five," said Mr Vatt. Chalkfield was the Councilman who
had succeeded to the Mayoralty in the preceding November.

<P>Farfrae was sorry at the intelligence, and Mr Vatt continued: "Well,
we know he's been going some days, and as his family is well provided for
we must take it all as it is. Now I have called to ask 'ee this - quite
privately. If I should nominate 'ee to succeed him, and there should be
no particular opposition, will 'ee accept the chair?"

<P>"But there are folk whose turn is before mine; and I'm over young, and
may be thought pushing!" said Farfrae after a pause.

<P>"Not at all. I don't speak for myself only, several have named it. You
won't refuse?"

<P>"We thought of going away," interposed Lucetta, looking at Farfrae anxiously.

<P>"It was only a fancy," Farfrae murmured. "I wouldna refuse if it is
the wish of a respectable majority in the Council."

<P>"Very well, then, look upon yourself as elected. We have had older men
long enough."

<P>When he was gone Farfrae said musingly, "See now how it's ourselves
that are ruled by the Powers above us! We plan this, but we do that. If
they want to make me Mayor I will stay, and Henchard must rave as he will."

<P>From this evening onward Lucetta was very uneasy. If she had not been
imprudence incarnate she would not have acted as she did when she met Henchard
by accident a day or two later. It was in the bustle of the market, when
no one could readily notice their discourse.

<P>"Michael," said she, "I must again ask you what I asked you months ago
- to return me any letters or papers of mine that you may have - unless
you have destroyed them? You must see how desirable it is that the times
at Jersey should be blotted out, for the good of all parties."

<P>"Why, bless the woman! - I packed up every scrap of your handwriting
to give you in the coach - but you never appeared."

<P>She explained how the death of her aunt had prevented her taking the
journey on that day. "And what became of the parcel then?" she asked.

<P>He could not say - he would consider. When she was gone he recollected
that he had left a heap of useless papers in his former dining-room safe
- built up in the wall of his old house - now occupied by Farfrae. The
letters might have been amongst them.

<P>A grotesque grin shaped itself on Henchard's face. Had that safe been
opened?

<P>On the very evening which followed this there was a great ringing of
bells in Casterbridge, and the combined brass, wood, catgut, and leather
bands played round the town with more prodigality of percussion-notes than
ever. Farfrae was Mayor - the two-hundredth odd of a series forming an
elective dynasty dating back to the days of Charles I - and the fair Lucetta
was the courted of the town... But, ah! that worm i' the bud - Henchard;
what he could tell!

<P>He, in the meantime, festering with indignation at some erroneous intelligence
of Farfrae's opposition to the scheme for installing him in the little
seed-shop, was greeted with the news of the municipal election (Which,
by reason of Farfrae's comparative youth and his Scottish nativity - a
thing unprecedented in the case - had an interest far beyond the ordinary).
The bell-ringing and the band-playing, loud as Tamerlane's trumpet, goaded
the downfallen Henchard indescribably: the ousting now seemed to him to
be complete.

<P>The next morning he went to the corn-yard as usual, and about eleven
o'clock Donald entered through the green door, with no trace of the worshipful
about him. The yet more emphatic change of places between him and Henchard
which this election had established renewed a slight embarrassment in the
manner of the modest younger man; but Henchard showed the front of one
who had overlooked all this; and Farfrae met his amenities half-way at
once.

<P>"I was going to ask you," said Henchard, "about a packet that I may
possibly have left in my old safe in the dining-room." He added particulars.

<P>"If so, it is there now," said Farfrae. "I have never opened the safe
at all as yet; for I keep ma papers at the bank, to sleep easy o' nights."

<P>"It was not of much consequence - to me," said Henchard. "But I'll call
for it this evening, if you don't mind?"

<P>It was quite late when he fulfilled his promise. He had primed himself
with grog, as he did very frequently now, and a curl of sardonic humour
hung on his lip as he approached the house, as though he were contemplating
some terrible form of amusement. Whatever it was, the incident of his entry
did not diminish its force, this being his first visit to the house since
he had lived there as owner. The ring of the bell spoke to him like the
voice of a familiar drudge who had been bribed to forsake him; the movements
of the doors were revivals of dead days.

<P>Farfrae invited him into the dining-room, where he at once unlocked
the iron safe built into the wall, <I>his</I>, Henchard's safe, made by
an ingenious locksmith under his direction. Farfrae drew thence the parcel,
and other papers, with apologies for not having returned them.

<P>"Never mind," said Henchard drily. "The fact is they are letters mostly...
Yes," he went on, sitting down and unfolding Lucetta's passionate bundle,
"here they be. That ever I should see 'em again! I hope Mrs Farfrae is
well after her exertions of yesterday?"

<P>"She has felt a bit weary; and has gone to bed airly on that account."

<P>Henchard returned to the letters, sorting them over with interest, Farfrae
being seated at the other end of the dining-table. "You don't forget, of
course," he resumed, "that curious chapter in the history of my past which
I told you of, and that you gave me some assistance in? These letters are,
in fact, related to that unhappy business. Though, thank God, it is all
over now."

<P>"What became of the poor woman?" asked Farfrae.

<P>"Luckily she married, and married well," said Henchard. "So that these
reproaches she poured out on me do not now cause me any twinges, as they
might otherwise have done... Just listen to what an angry woman will say!"

<P>Farfrae, willing to humour Henchard, though quite uninterested, and
bursting with yawns, gave well mannered attention.

<P>"""For me,""" Henchard read, """there is practically no future. A creature
too unconventionally devoted to you - who feels it impossible that she
can be wife of any other man; and who is yet no more to you than the first
woman you meet in the street - such am I. I quite acquit you of any intention
to wrong me, yet you are the door through which wrong has come to me. That
in the event of your present wife's death you will place me in her position
is a consolation so far as it goes - but how far does it go? Thus I sit
here, forsaken by my few acquaintance, and forsaken by you!"

<P>"That's how she went on to me," said Henchard, "acres of words like
that, when what had happened was what I could not cure."

<P>"Yes," said Farfrae absently, "it is the way wi' women." But the fact
was that he knew very little of the sex; yet detecting a sort of resemblance
in style between the effusions of the woman he worshipped and those of
the supposed stranger, he concluded that Aphrodite ever spoke thus, whosoever
the personality she assumed.

<P>Henchard unfolded another letter, and read it through likewise, stopping
at the subscription as before. "Her name I don't give," he said blandly.
"As I didn't marry her, and another man did, I can scarcely do that in
fairness to her."

<P>"Tr-rue, tr-rue," said Farfrae. "But why didn't you marry her when your
wife Susan died?" Farfrae asked this and the other questions in the comfortably
indifferent tone of one whom the matter very remotely concerned.

<P>"Ah - well you may ask that!" said Henchard, the new-moon-shaped grin
adumbrating itself again upon his mouth. "In spite of all her protestations,
when I came forward to do so, as in generosity bound, she was not the woman
for me."

<P>"She had already married another - maybe?"

<P>Henchard seemed to think it would be sailing too near the wind to descend
further into particulars, and he answered "Yes."

<P>"The young lady must have had a heart that bore transplanting very readily!"

<P>"She had, she had," said Henchard emphatically.

<P>He opened a third and fourth letter, and read. This time he approached
the conclusion as if the signature were indeed coming with the rest. But
again he stopped short. The truth was that, as may be divined, he had quite
intended to effect a grand catastrophe at the end of this drama by reading
out the name; he had come to the house with no other thought. But sitting
there in cold blood he could not do it. Such a wrecking of hearts appalled
even him. His quality was such that he could have annihilated them both
in the heat of action; but to accomplish the deed by oral poison was beyond
the nerve of his enmity.
