Meanwhile, Winterborne and Grace Melbury had also undergone their

little experiences of the same homeward journey.



As he drove off with her out of the town the glances of people

fell upon them, the younger thinking that Mr. Winterborne was in a

pleasant place, and wondering in what relation he stood towards

her.  Winterborne himself was unconscious of this.  Occupied

solely with the idea of having her in charge, he did not notice

much with outward eye, neither observing how she was dressed, nor

the effect of the picture they together composed in the landscape.



Their conversation was in briefest phrase for some time, Grace

being somewhat disconcerted, through not having understood till

they were about to start that Giles was to be her sole conductor

in place of her father.  When they were in the open country he

spoke.



"Don't Brownley's farm-buildings look strange to you, now they

have been moved bodily from the hollow where the old ones stood to

the top of the hill?"



She admitted that they did, though she should not have seen any

difference in them if he had not pointed it out.



"They had a good crop of bitter-sweets; they couldn't grind them

all" (nodding towards an orchard where some heaps of apples had

been left lying ever since the ingathering).



She said "Yes," but looking at another orchard.



"Why, you are looking at John-apple-trees! You know bitter-sweets--

you used to well enough!"



"I am afraid I have forgotten, and it is getting too dark to

distinguish."



Winterborne did not continue.  It seemed as if the knowledge and

interest which had formerly moved Grace's mind had quite died away

from her.  He wondered whether the special attributes of his image

in the past had evaporated like these other things.



However that might be, the fact at present was merely this, that

where he was seeing John-apples and farm-buildings she was

beholding a far remoter scene--a scene no less innocent and

simple, indeed, but much contrasting--a broad lawn in the

fashionable suburb of a fast city, the evergreen leaves shining in

the evening sun, amid which bounding girls, gracefully clad in

artistic arrangements of blue, brown, red, black, and white, were

playing at games, with laughter and chat, in all the pride of

life, the notes of piano and harp trembling in the air from the

open windows adjoining.  Moreover, they were girls--and this was a

fact which Grace Melbury's delicate femininity could not lose

sight of--whose parents Giles would have addressed with a

deferential Sir or Madam.  Beside this visioned scene the homely

farmsteads did not quite hold their own from her present twenty-

year point of survey.  For all his woodland sequestration, Giles

knew the primitive simplicity of the subject he had started, and

now sounded a deeper note.



"'Twas very odd what we said to each other years ago; I often

think of it.  I mean our saying that if we still liked each other

when you were twenty and I twenty-five, we'd--"



"It was child's tattle."



"H'm!" said Giles, suddenly.



"I mean we were young," said she, more considerately.  That gruff

manner of his in making inquiries reminded her that he was

unaltered in much.



"Yes....I beg your pardon, Miss Melbury; your father SENT me to

meet you to-day."



"I know it, and I am glad of it."



He seemed satisfied with her tone and went on: "At that time you

were sitting beside me at the back of your father's covered car,

when we were coming home from gypsying, all the party being

squeezed in together as tight as sheep in an auction-pen.  It got

darker and darker, and I said--I forget the exact words--but I put

my arm round your waist and there you let it stay till your

father, sitting in front suddenly stopped telling his story to

Farmer Bollen, to light his pipe.  The flash shone into the car,

and showed us all up distinctly; my arm flew from your waist like

lightning; yet not so quickly but that some of 'em had seen, and

laughed at us.  Yet your father, to our amazement, instead of

being angry, was mild as milk, and seemed quite pleased.  Have you

forgot all that, or haven't you?"



She owned that she remembered it very well, now that he mentioned

the circumstances.  "But, goodness! I must have been in short

frocks," she said.



"Come now, Miss Melbury, that won't do! Short frocks, indeed! You

know better, as well as I."



Grace thereupon declared that she would not argue with an old

friend she valued so highly as she valued him, saying the words

with the easy elusiveness that will be polite at all costs.  It

might possibly be true, she added, that she was getting on in

girlhood when that event took place; but if it were so, then she

was virtually no less than an old woman now, so far did the time

seem removed from her present.  "Do you ever look at things

philosophically instead of personally?" she asked.



"I can't say that I do," answered Giles, his eyes lingering far

ahead upon a dark spot, which proved to be a brougham.



"I think you may, sometimes, with advantage," said she.  "Look at

yourself as a pitcher drifting on the stream with other pitchers,

and consider what contrivances are most desirable for avoiding

cracks in general, and not only for saving your poor one.  Shall I

tell you all about Bath or Cheltenham, or places on the Continent

that I visited last summer?"



"With all my heart."



She then described places and persons in such terms as might have

been used for that purpose by any woman to any man within the four

seas, so entirely absent from that description was everything

specially appertaining to her own existence.  When she had done

she said, gayly, "Now do you tell me in return what has happened

in Hintock since I have been away."



"Anything to keep the conversation away from her and me," said

Giles within him.



It was true cultivation had so far advanced in the soil of Miss

Melbury's mind as to lead her to talk by rote of anything save of

that she knew well, and had the greatest interest in developing--

that is to say, herself.



He had not proceeded far with his somewhat bald narration when

they drew near the carriage that had been preceding them for some

time.  Miss Melbury inquired if he knew whose carriage it was.



Winterborne, although he had seen it, had not taken it into

account.  On examination, he said it was Mrs. Charmond's.



Grace watched the vehicle and its easy roll, and seemed to feel

more nearly akin to it than to the one she was in.



"Pooh! We can polish off the mileage as well as they, come to

that," said Winterborne, reading her mind; and rising to emulation

at what it bespoke, he whipped on the horse.  This it was which

had brought the nose of Mr. Melbury's old gray close to the back

of Mrs. Charmond's much-eclipsing vehicle.



"There's Marty South Sitting up with the coachman," said he,

discerning her by her dress.



"Ah, poor Marty! I must ask her to come to see me this very

evening.  How does she happen to be riding there?"



"I don't know.  It is very singular."



Thus these people with converging destinies went along the road

together, till Winterborne, leaving the track of the carriage,

turned into Little Hintock, where almost the first house was the

timber-merchant's.  Pencils of dancing light streamed out of the

windows sufficiently to show the white laurestinus flowers, and

glance over the polished leaves of laurel.  The interior of the

rooms could be seen distinctly, warmed up by the fire-flames,

which in the parlor were reflected from the glass of the pictures

and bookcase, and in the kitchen from the utensils and ware.



"Let us look at the dear place for a moment before we call them,"

she said.



In the kitchen dinner was preparing; for though Melbury dined at

one o'clock at other times, to-day the meal had been kept back for

Grace.  A rickety old spit was in motion, its end being fixed in

the fire-dog, and the whole kept going by means of a cord conveyed

over pulleys along the ceiling to a large stone suspended in a

corner of the room.  Old Grammer Oliver came and wound it up with

a rattle like that of a mill.



In the parlor a large shade of Mrs. Melbury's head fell on the

wall and ceiling; but before the girl had regarded this room many

moments their presence was discovered, and her father and step-

mother came out to welcome her.



The character of the Melbury family was of that kind which evinces

some shyness in showing strong emotion among each other: a trait

frequent in rural households, and one which stands in curiously

inverse relation to most of the peculiarities distinguishing

villagers from the people of towns.  Thus hiding their warmer

feelings under commonplace talk all round, Grace's reception

produced no extraordinary demonstrations.  But that more was felt

than was enacted appeared from the fact that her father, in taking

her in-doors, quite forgot the presence of Giles without, as did

also Grace herself.  He said nothing, but took the gig round to

the yard and called out from the spar-house the man who

particularly attended to these matters when there was no

conversation to draw him off among the copse-workers inside. 

Winterborne then returned to the door with the intention of

entering the house.



The family had gone into the parlor, and were still absorbed in

themselves.  The fire was, as before, the only light, and it

irradiated Grace's face and hands so as to make them look

wondrously smooth and fair beside those of the two elders; shining

also through the loose hair about her temples as sunlight through

a brake.  Her father was surveying her in a dazed conjecture, so

much had she developed and progressed in manner and stature since

he last had set eyes on her.



Observing these things, Winterborne remained dubious by the door,

mechanically tracing with his fingers certain time-worn letters

carved in the jambs--initials of by-gone generations of

householders who had lived and died there.



No, he declared to himself, he would not enter and join the

family; they had forgotten him, and it was enough for to-day that

he had brought her home.  Still, he was a little surprised that

her father's eagerness to send him for Grace should have resulted

in such an anticlimax as this.



He walked softly away into the lane towards his own house, looking

back when he reached the turning, from which he could get a last

glimpse of the timber-merchant's roof.  He hazarded guesses as to

what Grace was saying just at that moment, and murmured, with some

self-derision, "nothing about me!" He looked also in the other

direction, and saw against the sky the thatched hip and solitary

chimney of Marty's cottage, and thought of her too, struggling

bravely along under that humble shelter, among her spar-gads and

pots and skimmers.



At the timber-merchant's, in the mean time, the conversation

flowed; and, as Giles Winterborne had rightly enough deemed, on

subjects in which he had no share.  Among the excluding matters

there was, for one, the effect upon Mr. Melbury of the womanly

mien and manners of his daughter, which took him so much unawares

that, though it did not make him absolutely forget the existence

of her conductor homeward, thrust Giles's image back into quite

the obscurest cellarage of his brain.  Another was his interview

with Mrs. Charmond's agent that morning, at which the lady herself

had been present for a few minutes.  Melbury had purchased some

standing timber from her a long time before, and now that the date

had come for felling it he was left to pursue almost his own

course.  This was what the household were actually talking of

during Giles's cogitation without; and Melbury's satisfaction with

the clear atmosphere that had arisen between himself and the deity

of the groves which enclosed his residence was the cause of a

counterbalancing mistiness on the side towards Winterborne.



"So thoroughly does she trust me," said Melbury, "that I might

fell, top, or lop, on my own judgment, any stick o' timber

whatever in her wood, and fix the price o't, and settle the

matter.  But, name it all! I wouldn't do such a thing.  However,

it may be useful to have this good understanding with her....I

wish she took more interest in the place, and stayed here all the

year round."



"I am afraid 'tis not her regard for you, but her dislike of

Hintock, that makes her so easy about the trees," said Mrs.

Melbury.



When dinner was over, Grace took a candle and began to ramble

pleasurably through the rooms of her old home, from which she had

latterly become wellnigh an alien.  Each nook and each object

revived a memory, and simultaneously modified it.  The chambers

seemed lower than they had appeared on any previous occasion of

her return, the surfaces of both walls and ceilings standing in

such relations to the eye that it could not avoid taking

microscopic note of their irregularities and old fashion.  Her own

bedroom wore at once a look more familiar than when she had left

it, and yet a face estranged.  The world of little things therein

gazed at her in helpless stationariness, as though they had tried

and been unable to make any progress without her presence.  Over

the place where her candle had been accustomed to stand, when she

had used to read in bed till the midnight hour, there was still

the brown spot of smoke.  She did not know that her father had

taken especial care to keep it from being cleaned off.



Having concluded her perambulation of this now uselessly

commodious edifice, Grace began to feel that she had come a long

journey since the morning; and when her father had been up

himself, as well as his wife, to see that her room was comfortable

and the fire burning, she prepared to retire for the night.  No

sooner, however, was she in bed than her momentary sleepiness took

itself off, and she wished she had stayed up longer.  She amused

herself by listening to the old familiar noises that she could

hear to be still going on down-stairs, and by looking towards the

window as she lay.  The blind had been drawn up, as she used to

have it when a girl, and she could just discern the dim tree-tops

against the sky on the neighboring hill.  Beneath this meeting-

line of light and shade nothing was visible save one solitary

point of light, which blinked as the tree-twigs waved to and fro

before its beams.  From its position it seemed to radiate from the

window of a house on the hill-side.  The house had been empty when

she was last at home, and she wondered who inhabited the place

now.



Her conjectures, however, were not intently carried on, and she

was watching the light quite idly, when it gradually changed

color, and at length shone blue as sapphire.  Thus it remained

several minutes, and then it passed through violet to red.



Her curiosity was so widely awakened by the phenomenon that she

sat up in bed, and stared steadily at the shine.  An appearance of

this sort, sufficient to excite attention anywhere, was no less

than a marvel in Hintock, as Grace had known the hamlet.  Almost

every diurnal and nocturnal effect in that woodland place had

hitherto been the direct result of the regular terrestrial roll

which produced the season's changes; but here was something

dissociated from these normal sequences, and foreign to local

habit and knowledge.



It was about this moment that Grace heard the household below

preparing to retire, the most emphatic noise in the proceeding

being that of her father bolting the doors.  Then the stairs

creaked, and her father and mother passed her chamber.  The last

to come was Grammer Oliver.



Grace slid out of bed, ran across the room, and lifting the latch,

said, "I am not asleep, Grammer.  Come in and talk to me."



Before the old woman had entered, Grace was again under the

bedclothes.  Grammer set down her candlestick, and seated herself

on the edge of Miss Melbury's coverlet.



"I want you to tell me what light that is I see on the hill-side,"

said Grace.



Mrs. Oliver looked across.  "Oh, that," she said, "is from the

doctor's.  He's often doing things of that sort.  Perhaps you

don't know that we've a doctor living here now--Mr. Fitzpiers by

name?"



Grace admitted that she had not heard of him.



"Well, then, miss, he's come here to get up a practice.  I know

him very well, through going there to help 'em scrub sometimes,

which your father said I might do, if I wanted to, in my spare

time.  Being a bachelor-man, he've only a lad in the house.  Oh

yes, I know him very well.  Sometimes he'll talk to me as if I

were his own mother."



"Indeed."



"Yes.  'Grammer,' he said one day, when I asked him why he came

here where there's hardly anybody living, 'I'll tell you why I

came here.  I took a map, and I marked on it where Dr. Jones's

practice ends to the north of this district, and where Mr.

Taylor's ends on the south, and little Jimmy Green's on the east,

and somebody else's to the west.  Then I took a pair of compasses,

and found the exact middle of the country that was left between

these bounds, and that middle was Little Hintock; so here I

am....'  But, Lord, there: poor young man!"



"Why?"



"He said, 'Grammer Oliver, I've been here three months, and

although there are a good many people in the Hintocks and the

villages round, and a scattered practice is often a very good one,

I don't seem to get many patients.  And there's no society at all;

and I'm pretty near melancholy mad,' he said, with a great yawn. 

'I should be quite if it were not for my books, and my lab--

laboratory, and what not.  Grammer, I was made for higher things.'

And then he'd yawn and yawn again."



"Was he really made for higher things, do you think? I mean, is he

clever?"



"Well, no.  How can he be clever? He may be able to jine up a

broken man or woman after a fashion, and put his finger upon an

ache if you tell him nearly where 'tis; but these young men--they

should live to my time of life, and then they'd see how clever

they were at five-and-twenty! And yet he's a projick, a real

projick, and says the oddest of rozums.  'Ah, Grammer,' he said,

at another time, 'let me tell you that Everything is Nothing. 

There's only Me and not Me in the whole world.' And he told me

that no man's hands could help what they did, any more than the

hands of a clock....Yes, he's a man of strange meditations, and

his eyes seem to see as far as the north star."



"He will soon go away, no doubt."



"I don't think so." Grace did not say "Why?" and Grammer

hesitated.  At last she went on: "Don't tell your father or

mother, miss, if I let you know a secret."



Grace gave the required promise.



"Well, he talks of buying me; so he won't go away just yet."



"Buying you!--how?"



"Not my soul--my body, when I'm dead.  One day when I was there

cleaning, he said, 'Grammer, you've a large brain--a very large

organ of brain,' he said.  'A woman's is usually four ounces less

than a man's; but yours is man's size.' Well, then--hee, hee!--

after he'd flattered me a bit like that, he said he'd give me ten

pounds to have me as a natomy after my death.  Well, knowing I'd

no chick nor chiel left, and nobody with any interest in me, I

thought, faith, if I can be of any use to my fellow-creatures

after I'm gone they are welcome to my services; so I said I'd

think it over, and would most likely agree and take the ten

pounds.  Now this is a secret, miss, between us two.  The money

would be very useful to me; and I see no harm in it."



"Of course there's no harm.  But oh, Grammer, how can you think to

do it?  I wish you hadn't told me."



"I wish I hadn't--if you don't like to know it, miss.  But you

needn't mind.  Lord--hee, hee!--I shall keep him waiting many a

year yet, bless ye!"



"I hope you will, I am sure."



The girl thereupon fell into such deep reflection that

conversation languished, and Grammer Oliver, taking her candle,

wished Miss Melbury good-night.  The latter's eyes rested on the

distant glimmer, around which she allowed her reasoning fancy to

play in vague eddies that shaped the doings of the philosopher

behind that light on the lines of intelligence just received.  It

was strange to her to come back from the world to Little Hintock

and find in one of its nooks, like a tropical plant in a hedge-

row, a nucleus of advanced ideas and practices which had nothing

in common with the life around.  Chemical experiments, anatomical

projects, and metaphysical conceptions had found a strange home

here.



Thus she remained thinking, the imagined pursuits of the man

behind the light intermingling with conjectural sketches of his

personality, till her eyes fell together with their own heaviness,

and she slept.
