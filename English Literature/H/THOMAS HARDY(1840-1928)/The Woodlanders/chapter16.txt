Dr. Fitzpiers lived on the slope of the hill, in a house of much

less pretension, both as to architecture and as to magnitude, than

the timber-merchant's.  The latter had, without doubt, been once

the manorial residence appertaining to the snug and modest domain

of Little Hintock, of which the boundaries were now lost by its

absorption with others of its kind into the adjoining estate of

Mrs. Charmond.  Though the Melburys themselves were unaware of the

fact, there was every reason to believe--at least so the parson

said that the owners of that little manor had been Melbury's own

ancestors, the family name occurring in numerous documents

relating to transfers of land about the time of the civil wars.



Mr. Fitzpiers's dwelling, on the contrary, was small, cottage-

like, and comparatively modern.  It had been occupied, and was in

part occupied still, by a retired farmer and his wife, who, on the

surgeon's arrival in quest of a home, had accommodated him by

receding from their front rooms into the kitchen quarter, whence

they administered to his wants, and emerged at regular intervals

to receive from him a not unwelcome addition to their income.



The cottage and its garden were so regular in their arrangement

that they might have been laid out by a Dutch designer of the time

of William and Mary.  In a low, dense hedge, cut to wedge-shape,

was a door over which the hedge formed an arch, and from the

inside of the door a straight path, bordered with clipped box, ran

up the slope of the garden to the porch, which was exactly in the

middle of the house front, with two windows on each side.  Right

and left of the path were first a bed of gooseberry bushes; next

of currant; next of raspberry; next of strawberry; next of old-

fashioned flowers; at the corners opposite the porch being spheres

of box resembling a pair of school globes.  Over the roof of the

house could be seen the orchard, on yet higher ground, and behind

the orchard the forest-trees, reaching up to the crest of the

hill.



Opposite the garden door and visible from the parlor window was a

swing-gate leading into a field, across which there ran a foot-

path.  The swing-gate had just been repainted, and on one fine

afternoon, before the paint was dry, and while gnats were still

dying thereon, the surgeon was standing in his sitting-room

abstractedly looking out at the different pedestrians who passed

and repassed along that route.  Being of a philosophical stamp, he

perceived that the chararter of each of these travellers exhibited

itself in a somewhat amusing manner by his or her method of

handling the gate.



As regarded the men, there was not much variety: they gave the

gate a kick and passed through.  The women were more contrasting. 

To them the sticky wood-work was a barricade, a disgust, a menace,

a treachery, as the case might be.



The first that he noticed was a bouncing woman with her skirts

tucked up and her hair uncombed.  She grasped the gate without

looking, giving it a supplementary push with her shoulder, when

the white imprint drew from her an exclamation in language not too

refined.  She went to the green bank, sat down and rubbed herself

in the grass, cursing the while.



"Ha! ha! ha!" laughed the doctor.



The next was a girl, with her hair cropped short, in whom the

surgeon recognized the daughter of his late patient, the woodman

South.  Moreover, a black bonnet that she wore by way of mourning

unpleasantly reminded him that he had ordered the felling of a

tree which had caused her parent's death and Winterborne's losses. 

She walked and thought, and not recklessly; but her preoccupation

led her to grasp unsuspectingly the bar of the gate, and touch it

with her arm.  Fitzpiers felt sorry that she should have soiled

that new black frock, poor as it was, for it was probably her only

one.  She looked at her hand and arm, seemed but little surprised,

wiped off the disfigurement with an almost unmoved face, and as if

without abandoning her original thoughts.  Thus she went on her

way.



Then there came over the green quite a different sort of

personage.  She walked as delicately as if she had been bred in

town, and as firmly as if she had been bred in the country; she

seemed one who dimly knew her appearance to be attractive, but who

retained some of the charm of being ignorant of that fact by

forgetting it in a general pensiveness.  She approached the gate. 

To let such a creature touch it even with a tip of her glove was

to Fitzpiers almost like letting her proceed to tragical self-

destruction.  He jumped up and looked for his hat, but was unable

to find the right one; glancing again out of the window he saw

that he was too late.  Having come up, she stopped, looked at the

gate, picked up a little stick, and using it as a bayonet, pushed

open the obstacle without touching it at all.



He steadily watched her till she had passed out of sight,

recognizing her as the very young lady whom he had seen once

before and been unable to identify.  Whose could that emotional

face be? All the others he had seen in Hintock as yet oppressed

him with their crude rusticity; the contrast offered by this

suggested that she hailed from elsewhere.



Precisely these thoughts had occurred to him at the first time of

seeing her; but he now went a little further with them, and

considered that as there had been no carriage seen or heard lately

in that spot she could not have come a very long distance.  She

must be somebody staying at Hintock House? Possibly Mrs. Charmond,

of whom he had heard so much--at any rate an inmate, and this

probability was sufficient to set a mild radiance in the surgeon's

somewhat dull sky.



Fitzpiers sat down to the book he had been perusing.  It happened

to be that of a German metaphysician, for the doctor was not a

practical man, except by fits, and much preferred the ideal world

to the real, and the discovery of principles to their application. 

The young lady remained in his thoughts.  He might have followed

her; but he was not constitutionally active, and preferred a

conjectural pursuit.  However, when he went out for a ramble just

before dusk he insensibly took the direction of Hintock House,

which was the way that Grace had been walking, it having happened

that her mind had run on Mrs. Charmond that day, and she had

walked to the brow of a hill whence the house could be seen,

returning by another route.



Fitzpiers in his turn reached the edge of the glen, overlooking

the manor-house.  The shutters were shut, and only one chimney

smoked.  The mere aspect of the place was enough to inform him

that Mrs. Charmond had gone away and that nobody else was staying

there.  Fitzpiers felt a vague disappointment that the young lady

was not Mrs. Charmond, of whom he had heard so much; and without

pausing longer to gaze at a carcass from which the spirit had

flown, he bent his steps homeward.



Later in the evening Fitzpiers was summoned to visit a cottage

patient about two miles distant.  Like the majority of young

practitioners in his position he was far from having assumed the

dignity of being driven his rounds by a servant in a brougham that

flashed the sunlight like a mirror; his way of getting about was

by means of a gig which he drove himself, hitching the rein of the

horse to the gate post, shutter hook, or garden paling of the

domicile under visitation, or giving pennies to little boys to

hold the animal during his stay--pennies which were well earned

when the cases to be attended were of a certain cheerful kind that

wore out the patience of the little boys.



On this account of travelling alone, the night journeys which

Fitzpiers had frequently to take were dismal enough, a serious

apparent perversity in nature ruling that whenever there was to be

a birth in a particularly inaccessible and lonely place, that

event should occur in the night.  The surgeon, having been of late

years a town man, hated the solitary midnight woodland.  He was

not altogether skilful with the reins, and it often occurred to

his mind that if in some remote depths of the trees an accident

were to happen, the fact of his being alone might be the death of

him.  Hence he made a practice of picking up any countryman or lad

whom he chanced to pass by, and under the disguise of treating him

to a nice drive, obtained his companionship on the journey, and

his convenient assistance in opening gates.



The doctor had started on his way out of the village on the night

in question when the light of his lamps fell upon the musing form

of Winterborne, walking leisurely along, as if he had no object in

life.  Winterborne was a better class of companion than the doctor

usually could get, and he at once pulled up and asked him if he

would like a drive through the wood that fine night.



Giles seemed rather surprised at the doctor's friendliness, but

said that he had no objection, and accordingly mounted beside Mr.

Fitzpiers.



They drove along under the black boughs which formed a network

upon the stars, all the trees of a species alike in one respect,

and no two of them alike in another.  Looking up as they passed

under a horizontal bough they sometimes saw objects like large

tadpoles lodged diametrically across it, which Giles explained to

be pheasants there at roost; and they sometimes heard the report

of a gun, which reminded him that others knew what those tadpole

shapes represented as well as he.



Presently the doctor said what he had been going to say for some

time:



"Is there a young lady staying in this neighborhood--a very

attractive girl--with a little white boa round her neck, and white

fur round her gloves?"



Winterborne of course knew in a moment that Grace, whom he had

caught the doctor peering at, was represented by these

accessaries.  With a wary grimness, partly in his character,

partly induced by the circumstances, he evaded an answer by

saying, "I saw a young lady talking to Mrs. Charmond the other

day; perhaps it was she."



Fitzpiers concluded from this that Winterborne had not seen him

looking over the hedge.  "It might have been," he said.  "She is

quite a gentlewoman--the one I mean.  She cannot be a permanent

resident in Hintock or I should have seen her before.  Nor does

she look like one."



"She is not staying at Hintock House?"



"No; it is closed."



"Then perhaps she is staying at one of the cottages, or farm-

houses?"



"Oh no--you mistake.  She was a different sort of girl

altogether." As Giles was nobody, Fitzpiers treated him

accordingly, and apostrophized the night in continuation:





  "'She moved upon this earth a shape of brightness,

    A power, that from its objects scarcely drew

    One impulse of her being--in her lightness

    Most like some radiant cloud of morning dew,

    Which wanders through the waste air's pathless blue,

    To nourish some far desert: she did seem

    Beside me, gathering beauty as she grew,

    Like the bright shade of some immortal dream

    Which walks, when tempests sleep, the wave of life's dark

stream.'"





The consummate charm of the lines seemed to Winterborne, though he

divined that they were a quotation, to be somehow the result of

his lost love's charms upon Fitzpiers.



"You seem to be mightily in love with her, sir," he said, with a

sensation of heart-sickness, and more than ever resolved not to

mention Grace by name.



"Oh no--I am not that, Winterborne; people living insulated, as I

do by the solitude of this place, get charged with emotive fluid

like a Leyden-jar with electric, for want of some conductor at

hand to disperse it.  Human love is a subjective thing--the

essence itself of man, as that great thinker Spinoza the

philosopher says--ipsa hominis essentia--it is joy accompanied by

an idea which we project against any suitable object in the line

of our vision, just as the rainbow iris is projected against an

oak, ash, or elm tree indifferently.  So that if any other young

lady had appeared instead of the one who did appear, I should have

felt just the same interest in her, and have quoted precisely the

same lines from Shelley about her, as about this one I saw.  Such

miserable creatures of circumstance are we all!"



"Well, it is what we call being in love down in these parts,

whether or no," said Winterborne.



"You are right enough if you admit that I am in love with

something in my own head, and no thing in itself outside it at

all."



"Is it part of a country doctor's duties to learn that view of

things, may I ask, sir?" said Winterborne, adopting the Socratic

{Greek word: irony} with such well-assumed simplicity that

Fitzpiers answered, readily,



"Oh no.  The real truth is, Winterborne, that medical practice in

places like this is a very rule-of-thumb matter; a bottle of

bitter stuff for this and that old woman--the bitterer the better--

compounded from a few simple stereotyped prescriptions;

occasional attendance at births, where mere presence is almost

sufficient, so healthy and strong are the people; and a lance for

an abscess now and then.  Investigation and experiment cannot be

carried on without more appliances than one has here--though I

have attempted it a little."



Giles did not enter into this view of the case; what he had been

struck with was the curious parallelism between Mr. Fitzpiers's

manner and Grace's, as shown by the fact of both of them straying

into a subject of discourse so engrossing to themselves that it

made them forget it was foreign to him.



Nothing further passed between himself and the doctor in relation

to Grace till they were on their way back.  They had stopped at a

way-side inn for a glass of brandy and cider hot, and when they

were again in motion, Fitzpiers, possibly a little warmed by the

liquor, resumed the subject by saying, "I should like very much to

know who that young lady was."



"What difference can it make, if she's only the tree your rainbow

falls on?"



"Ha! ha! True."



"You have no wife, sir?"



"I have no wife, and no idea of one.  I hope to do better things

than marry and settle in Hintock.  Not but that it is well for a

medical man to be married, and sometimes, begad, 'twould be

pleasant enough in this place, with the wind roaring round the

house, and the rain and the boughs beating against it.  I hear

that you lost your life-holds by the death of South?"



"I did.  I lost in more ways than one."



They had reached the top of Hintock Lane or Street, if it could be

called such where three-quarters of the road-side consisted of

copse and orchard.  One of the first houses to be passed was

Melbury's.  A light was shining from a bedroom window facing

lengthwise of the lane.  Winterborne glanced at it, and saw what

was coming.  He had withheld an answer to the doctor's inquiry to

hinder his knowledge of Grace; but, as he thought to himself, "who

hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in

a garment?" he could not hinder what was doomed to arrive, and

might just as well have been outspoken.  As they came up to the

house, Grace's figure was distinctly visible, drawing the two

white curtains together which were used here instead of blinds.



"Why, there she is!" said Fitzpiers.  "How does she come there?"



"In the most natural way in the world.  It is her home.  Mr.

Melbury is her father."



"Oh, indeed--indeed--indeed!  How comes he to have a daughter of

that stamp?"



Winterborne laughed coldly.  "Won't money do anything," he said,

"if you've promising material to work upon? Why shouldn't a

Hintock girl, taken early from home, and put under proper

instruction, become as finished as any other young lady, if she's

got brains and good looks to begin with?"



"No reason at all why she shouldn't," murmured the surgeon, with

reflective disappointment.  "Only I didn't anticipate quite that

kind of origin for her."



"And you think an inch or two less of her now." There was a little

tremor in Winterborne's voice as he spoke.



"Well," said the doctor, with recovered warmth, "I am not so sure

that I think less of her.  At first it was a sort of blow; but,

dammy! I'll stick up for her.  She's charming, every inch of her!"



"So she is," said Winterborne, "but not to me."



From this ambiguous expression of the reticent woodlander's, Dr. 

Fitzpiers inferred that Giles disliked Miss Melbury because of

some haughtiness in her bearing towards him, and had, on that

account, withheld her name.  The supposition did not tend to

diminish his admiration for her.
