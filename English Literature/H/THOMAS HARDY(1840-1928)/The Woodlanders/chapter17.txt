Grace's exhibition of herself, in the act of pulling-to the

window-curtains, had been the result of an unfortunate incident in

the house that day--nothing less than the illness of Grammer

Oliver, a woman who had never till now lain down for such a reason

in her life.  Like others to whom unbroken years of health has

made the idea of keeping their bed almost as repugnant as death

itself, she had continued on foot till she literally fell on the

floor; and though she had, as yet, been scarcely a day off duty,

she had sickened into quite a different personage from the

independent Grammer of the yard and spar-house.  Ill as she was,

on one point she was firm.  On no account would she see a doctor;

in other words, Fitzpiers.



The room in which Grace had been discerned was not her own, but

the old woman's.  On the girl's way to bed she had received a

message from Grammer, to the effect that she would much like to

speak to her that night.



Grace entered, and set the candle on a low chair beside the bed,

so that the profile of Grammer as she lay cast itself in a keen

shadow upon the whitened wall, her large head being still further

magnified by an enormous turban, which was, really, her petticoat

wound in a wreath round her temples.  Grace put the room a little

in order, and approaching the sick woman, said, "I am come,

Grammer, as you wish.  Do let us send for the doctor before it

gets later."



"I will not have him," said Grammer Oliver, decisively.



"Then somebody to sit up with you."



"Can't abear it! No; I wanted to see you, Miss Grace, because 'ch

have something on my mind.  Dear Miss Grace, I TOOK THAT MONEY OF

THE DOCTOR, AFTER ALL!"



"What money?"



"The ten pounds."



Grace did not quite understand.



"The ten pounds he offered me for my head, because I've a large

brain.  I signed a paper when I took the money, not feeling

concerned about it at all.  I have not liked to tell ye that it

was really settled with him, because you showed such horror at the

notion.  Well, having thought it over more at length, I wish I

hadn't done it; and it weighs upon my mind.  John South's death of

fear about the tree makes me think that I shall die of this....'Ch

have been going to ask him again to let me off, but I hadn't the

face."



"Why?"



"I've spent some of the money--more'n two pounds o't.  It do

wherrit me terribly; and I shall die o' the thought of that paper

I signed with my holy cross, as South died of his trouble."



 "If you ask him to burn the paper he will, I'm sure, and think no

more of it."



 "'Ch have done it once already, miss.  But he laughed cruel like. 

'Yours is such a fine brain, Grammer, 'er said, 'that science

couldn't afford to lose you.  Besides, you've taken my

money.'...Don't let your father know of this, please, on no

account whatever!"



"No, no.  I will let you have the money to return to him."



Grammer rolled her head negatively upon the pillow. "Even if I

should be well enough to take it to him, he won't like it.  Though

why he should so particular want to look into the works of a poor

old woman's head-piece like mine when there's so many other folks

about, I don't know.  I know how he'll answer me: 'A lonely person

like you, Grammer,' er woll say.  'What difference is it to you

what becomes of ye when the breath's out of your body?' Oh, it do

trouble me! If you only knew how he do chevy me round the chimmer

in my dreams, you'd pity me.  How I could do it I can't think! But

'ch was always so rackless!...If I only had anybody to plead for

me!"



"Mrs. Melbury would, I am sure."



"Ay; but he wouldn't hearken to she! It wants a younger face than

hers to work upon such as he."



Grace started with comprehension.  "You don't think he would do it

for me?" she said.



"Oh, wouldn't he!"



"I couldn't go to him, Grammer, on any account.  I don't know him

at all."



"Ah, if I were a young lady," said the artful Grammer, "and could

save a poor old woman's skellington from a heathen doctor instead

of a Christian grave, I would do it, and be glad to.  But nobody

will do anything for a poor old familiar friend but push her out

of the way."



You are very ungrateful, Grammer, to say that.  But you are ill, I

know, and that's why you speak so.  Now believe me, you are not

going to die yet.  Remember you told me yourself that you meant to

keep him waiting many a year."



"Ay, one can joke when one is well, even in old age; but in

sickness one's gayety falters to grief; and that which seemed

small looks large; and the grim far-off seems near."



Grace's eyes had tears in them.  "I don't like to go to him on

such an errand, Grammer," she said, brokenly.  "But I will, to

ease your mind."



It was with extreme reluctance that Grace cloaked herself next

morning for the undertaking.  She was all the more indisposed to

the journey by reason of Grammer's allusion to the effect of a

pretty face upon Dr. Fitzpiers; and hence she most illogically did

that which, had the doctor never seen her, would have operated to

stultify the sole motive of her journey; that is to say, she put

on a woollen veil, which hid all her face except an occasional

spark of her eyes.



Her own wish that nothing should be known of this strange and

grewsome proceeding, no less than Grammer Oliver's own desire, led

Grace to take every precaution against being discovered.  She went

out by the garden door as the safest way, all the household having

occupations at the other side.  The morning looked forbidding

enough when she stealthily opened it.  The battle between frost

and thaw was continuing in mid-air: the trees dripped on the

garden-plots, where no vegetables would grow for the dripping,

though they were planted year after year with that curious

mechanical regularity of country people in the face of

hopelessness; the moss which covered the once broad gravel terrace

was swamped; and Grace stood irresolute.  Then she thought of poor

Grammer, and her dreams of the doctor running after her, scalpel

in hand, and the possibility of a case so curiously similar to

South's ending in the same way; thereupon she stepped out into the

drizzle.



The nature of her errand, and Grammer Oliver's account of the

compact she had made, lent a fascinating horror to Grace's

conception of Fitzpiers.  She knew that he was a young man; but

her single object in seeking an interview with him put all

considerations of his age and social aspect from her mind. 

Standing as she stood, in Grammer Oliver's shoes, he was simply a

remorseless Jove of the sciences, who would not have mercy, and

would have sacrifice; a man whom, save for this, she would have

preferred to avoid knowing.  But since, in such a small village,

it was improbable that any long time could pass without their

meeting, there was not much to deplore in her having to meet him

now.



But, as need hardly be said, Miss Melbury's view of the doctor as

a merciless, unwavering, irresistible scientist was not quite in

accordance with fact.  The real Dr. Fitzpiers w as a man of too

many hobbies to show likelihood of rising to any great eminence in

the profession he had chosen, or even to acquire any wide practice

in the rural district he had marked out as his field of survey for

the present.  In the course of a year his mind was accustomed to

pass in a grand solar sweep through all the zodiacal signs of the

intellectual heaven.  Sometimes it was in the Ram, sometimes in

the Bull; one month he would be immersed in alchemy, another in

poesy; one month in the Twins of astrology and astronomy; then in

the Crab of German literature and metaphysics.  In justice to him

it must be stated that he took such studies as were immediately

related to his own profession in turn with the rest, and it had

been in a month of anatomical ardor without the possibility of a

subject that he had proposed to Grammer Oliver the terms she had

mentioned to her mistress.



As may be inferred from the tone of his conversation with

Winterborne, he had lately plunged into abstract philosophy with

much zest; perhaps his keenly appreciative, modern, unpractical

mind found this a realm more to his taste than any other.  Though

his aims were desultory, Fitzpiers's mental constitution was not

without its admirable side; a keen inquirer he honestly was, even

if the midnight rays of his lamp, visible so far through the trees

of Hintock, lighted rank literatures of emotion and passion as

often as, or oftener than, the books and materiel of science.



But whether he meditated the Muses or the philosophers, the

loneliness of Hintock life was beginning to tell upon his

impressionable nature.  Winter in a solitary house in the country,

without society, is tolerable, nay, even enjoyable and delightful,

given certain conditions, but these are not the conditions which

attach to the life of a professional man who drops down into such

a place by mere accident.  They were present to the lives of

Winterborne, Melbury, and Grace; but not to the doctor's.  They

are old association--an almost exhaustive biographical or

historical acquaintance with every object, animate and inanimate,

within the observer's horizon.  He must know all about those

invisible ones of the days gone by, whose feet have traversed the

fields which look so gray from his windows; recall whose creaking

plough has turned those sods from time to time; whose hands

planted the trees that form a crest to the opposite hill; whose

horses and hounds have torn through that underwood; what birds

affect that particular brake; what domestic dramas of love,

jealousy, revenge, or disappointment have been enacted in the

cottages, the mansion, the street, or on the green.  The spot may

have beauty, grandeur, salubrity, convenience; but if it lack

memories it will ultimately pall upon him who settles there

without opportunity of intercourse with his kind.



In such circumstances, maybe, an old man dreams of an ideal

friend, till he throws himself into the arms of any impostor who

chooses to wear that title on his face.  A young man may dream of

an ideal friend likewise, but some humor of the blood will

probably lead him to think rather of an ideal mistress, and at

length the rustle of a woman's dress, the sound of her voice, or

the transit of her form across the field of his vision, will

enkindle his soul with a flame that blinds his eyes.



The discovery of the attractive Grace's name and family would have

been enough in other circumstances to lead the doctor, if not to

put her personality out of his head, to change the character of

his interest in her.  Instead of treasuring her image as a rarity,

he would at most have played with it as a toy.  He was that kind

of a man.  But situated here he could not go so far as amative

cruelty.  He dismissed all reverential thought about her, but he

could not help taking her seriously.



He went on to imagine the impossible.  So far, indeed, did he go

in this futile direction that, as others are wont to do, he

constructed dialogues and scenes in which Grace had turned out to

be the mistress of Hintock Manor-house, the mysterious Mrs.

Charmond, particularly ready and willing to be wooed by himself

and nobody else.  "Well, she isn't that," he said, finally.  "But

she's a very sweet, nice, exceptional girl."



The next morning he breakfasted alone, as usual.  It was snowing

with a fine-flaked desultoriness just sufficient to make the

woodland gray, without ever achieving whiteness.  There was not a

single letter for Fitzpiers, only a medical circular and a weekly

newspaper.



To sit before a large fire on such mornings, and read, and

gradually acquire energy till the evening came, and then, with

lamp alight, and feeling full of vigor, to pursue some engrossing

subject or other till the small hours, had hitherto been his

practice.  But to-day he could not settle into his chair.  That

self-contained position he had lately occupied, in which the only

attention demanded was the concentration of the inner eye, all

outer regard being quite gratuitous, seemed to have been taken by

insidious stratagem, and for the first time he had an interest

outside the house.  He walked from one window to another, and

became aware that the most irksome of solitudes is not the

solitude of remoteness, but that which is just outside desirable

company.



The breakfast hour went by heavily enough, and the next followed,

in the same half-snowy, half-rainy style, the weather now being

the inevitable relapse which sooner or later succeeds a time too

radiant for the season, such as they had enjoyed in the late

midwinter at Hintock.  To people at home there these changeful

tricks had their interests; the strange mistakes that some of the

more sanguine trees had made in budding before their month, to be

incontinently glued up by frozen thawings now; the similar

sanguine errors of impulsive birds in framing nests that were now

swamped by snow-water, and other such incidents, prevented any

sense of wearisomeness in the minds of the natives.  But these

were features of a world not familiar to Fitzpiers, and the inner

visions to which he had almost exclusively attended having

suddenly failed in their power to absorb him, he felt unutterably

dreary.



He wondered how long Miss Melbury was going to stay in Hintock. 

The season was unpropitious for accidental encounters with her

out-of-doors, and except by accident he saw not how they were to

become acquainted.  One thing was clear--any acquaintance with her

could only, with a due regard to his future, be casual, at most of

the nature of a flirtation; for he had high aims, and they would

some day lead him into other spheres than this.



Thus desultorily thinking he flung himself down upon the couch,

which, as in many draughty old country houses, was constructed

with a hood, being in fact a legitimate development from the

settle.  He tried to read as he reclined, but having sat up till

three o'clock that morning, the book slipped from his hand and he

fell asleep.
