The news was true.  The life--the one fragile life--that had been

used as a measuring-tape of time by law, was in danger of being

frayed away.  It was the last of a group of lives which had served

this purpose, at the end of whose breathings the small homestead

occupied by South himself, the larger one of Giles Winterborne,

and half a dozen others that had been in the possession of various

Hintock village families for the previous hundred years, and were

now Winterborne's, would fall in and become part of the

encompassing estate.



Yet a short two months earlier Marty's father, aged fifty-five

years, though something of a fidgety, anxious being, would have

been looked on as a man whose existence was so far removed from

hazardous as any in the parish, and as bidding fair to be

prolonged for another quarter of a century.



Winterborne walked up and down his garden next day thinking of the

contingency.  The sense that the paths he was pacing, the cabbage-

plots, the apple-trees, his dwelling, cider-cellar, wring-house,

stables, and weathercock, were all slipping away over his head and

beneath his feet, as if they were painted on a magic-lantern

slide, was curious.  In spite of John South's late indisposition

he had not anticipated danger.  To inquire concerning his health

had been to show less sympathy than to remain silent, considering

the material interest he possessed in the woodman's life, and he

had, accordingly, made a point of avoiding Marty's house.



While he was here in the garden somebody came to fetch him.  It

was Marty herself, and she showed her distress by her

unconsciousness of a cropped poll.



"Father is still so much troubled in his mind about that tree,"

she said.  "You know the tree I mean, Mr. Winterborne? the tall

one in front of the house, that he thinks will blow down and kill

us.  Can you come and see if you can persuade him out of his

notion? I can do nothing."



He accompanied her to the cottage, and she conducted him up-

stairs.  John South was pillowed up in a chair between the bed and

the window exactly opposite the latter, towards which his face was

turned.



"Ah, neighbor Winterborne," he said.  "I wouldn't have minded if

my life had only been my own to lose; I don't vallie it in much of

itself, and can let it go if 'tis required of me.  But to think

what 'tis worth to you, a young man rising in life, that do

trouble me! It seems a trick of dishonesty towards ye to go off at

fifty-five! I could bear up, I know I could, if it were not for

the tree--yes, the tree, 'tis that's killing me.  There he stands,

threatening my life every minute that the wind do blow.  He'll

come down upon us and squat us dead; and what will ye do when the

life on your property is taken away?"



"Never you mind me--that's of no consequence," said Giles.  "Think

of yourself alone."



He looked out of the window in the direction of the woodman's

gaze.  The tree was a tall elm, familiar to him from childhood,

which stood at a distance of two-thirds its own height from the

front of South's dwelling.  Whenever the wind blew, as it did now,

the tree rocked, naturally enough; and the sight of its motion and

sound of its sighs had gradually bred the terrifying illusion in

the woodman's mind that it would descend and kill him.  Thus he

would sit all day, in spite of persuasion, watching its every

sway, and listening to the melancholy Gregorian melodies which the

air wrung out of it.  This fear it apparently was, rather than any

organic disease which was eating away the health of John South.



As the tree waved, South waved his head, making it his flugel-man

with abject obedience.  "Ah, when it was quite a small tree," he

said, "and I was a little boy, I thought one day of chopping it

off with my hook to make a clothes-line prop with.  But I put off

doing it, and then I again thought that I would; but I forgot it,

and didn't.  And at last it got too big, and now 'tis my enemy,

and will be the death o' me.  Little did I think, when I let that

sapling stay, that a time would come when it would torment me, and

dash me into my grave."



"No, no," said Winterborne and Marty, soothingly.  But they

thought it possible that it might hasten him into his grave,

though in another way than by falling.



"I tell you what," added Winterborne, "I'll climb up this

afternoon and shroud off the lower boughs, and then it won't be so

heavy, and the wind won't affect it so."



"She won't allow it--a strange woman come from nobody knows where--

she won't have it done."



"You mean Mrs. Charmond?  Oh, she doesn't know there's such a tree

on her estate.  Besides, shrouding is not felling, and I'll risk

that much."



He went out, and when afternoon came he returned, took a billhook

from the woodman's shed, and with a ladder climbed into the lower

part of the tree, where he began lopping off--"shrouding," as they

called it at Hintock--the lowest boughs.  Each of these quivered

under his attack, bent, cracked, and fell into the hedge.  Having

cut away the lowest tier, he stepped off the ladder, climbed a few

steps higher, and attacked those at the next level.  Thus he

ascended with the progress of his work far above the top of the

ladder, cutting away his perches as he went, and leaving nothing

but a bare stem below him.



The work was troublesome, for the tree was large.  The afternoon

wore on, turning dark and misty about four o'clock.  From time to

time Giles cast his eyes across towards the bedroom window of

South, where, by the flickering fire in the chamber, he could see

the old man watching him, sitting motionless with a hand upon each

arm of the chair.  Beside him sat Marty, also straining her eyes

towards the skyey field of his operations.



A curious question suddenly occurred to Winterborne, and he

stopped his chopping.  He was operating on another person's

property to prolong the years of a lease by whose termination that

person would considerably benefit.  In that aspect of the case he

doubted if he ought to go on.  On the other hand he was working to

save a man's life, and this seemed to empower him to adopt

arbitrary measures.



The wind had died down to a calm, and while he was weighing the

circumstances he saw coming along the road through the increasing

mist a figure which, indistinct as it was, he knew well.  It was

Grace Melbury, on her way out from the house, probably for a short

evening walk before dark.  He arranged himself for a greeting from

her, since she could hardly avoid passing immediately beneath the

tree.



But Grace, though she looked up and saw him, was just at that time

too full of the words of her father to give him any encouragement. 

The years-long regard that she had had for him was not kindled by

her return into a flame of sufficient brilliancy to make her

rebellious.  Thinking that she might not see him, he cried, "Miss

Melbury, here I am."



She looked up again.  She was near enough to see the expression of

his face, and the nails in his soles, silver-bright with constant

walking.  But she did not reply; and dropping her glance again,

went on.



Winterborne's face grew strange; he mused, and proceeded

automatically with his work.  Grace meanwhile had not gone far. 

She had reached a gate, whereon she had leaned sadly, and

whispered to herself, "What shall I do?"



A sudden fog came on, and she curtailed her walk, passing under

the tree again on her return.  Again he addressed her.  "Grace,"

he said, when she was close to the trunk, "speak to me." She shook

her head without stopping, and went on to a little distance, where

she stood observing him from behind the hedge.



Her coldness had been kindly meant.  If it was to be done, she had

said to herself, it should be begun at once.  While she stood out

of observation Giles seemed to recognize her meaning; with a

sudden start he worked on, climbing higher, and cutting himself

off more and more from all intercourse with the sublunary world. 

At last he had worked himself so high up the elm, and the mist had

so thickened, that he could only just be discerned as a dark-gray

spot on the light-gray sky: he would have been altogether out of

notice but for the stroke of his billhook and the flight of a

bough downward, and its crash upon the hedge at intervals.



It was not to be done thus, after all: plainness and candor were

best.  She went back a third time; he did not see her now, and she

lingeringly gazed up at his unconscious figure, loath to put an

end to any kind of hope that might live on in him still.  "Giles--

Mr. Winterborne," she said.



He was so high amid the fog that he did not hear.  "Mr.

Winterborne!" she cried again, and this time he stopped, looked

down, and replied.



"My silence just now was not accident," she said, in an unequal

voice.  "My father says it is best not to think too much of that--

engagement, or understanding between us, that you know of.  I,

too, think that upon the whole he is right.  But we are friends,

you know, Giles, and almost relations."



"Very well," he answered, as if without surprise, in a voice which

barely reached down the tree.  "I have nothing to say in

objection--I cannot say anything till I've thought a while."



She added, with emotion in her tone, "For myself, I would have

married you--some day--I think.  But I give way, for I see it

would be unwise."



He made no reply, but sat back upon a bough, placed his elbow in a

fork, and rested his head upon his hand.  Thus he remained till

the fog and the night had completely enclosed him from her view.



Grace heaved a divided sigh, with a tense pause between, and moved

onward, her heart feeling uncomfortably big and heavy, and her

eyes wet.  Had Giles, instead of remaining still, immediately come

down from the tree to her, would she have continued in that filial

acquiescent frame of mind which she had announced to him as final? 

If it be true, as women themselves have declared, that one of

their sex is never so much inclined to throw in her lot with a man

for good and all as five minutes after she has told him such a

thing cannot be, the probabilities are that something might have

been done by the appearance of Winterborne on the ground beside

Grace. But he continued motionless and silent in that gloomy

Niflheim or fog-land which involved him, and she proceeded on her

way.



The spot seemed now to be quite deserted.  The light from South's

window made rays on the fog, but did not reach the tree.  A

quarter of an hour passed, and all was blackness overhead.  Giles

had not yet come down.



Then the tree seemed to shiver, then to heave a sigh; a movement

was audible, and Winterborne dropped almost noiselessly to the

ground.  He had thought the matter out, and having returned the

ladder and billhook to their places, pursued his way homeward.  He

would not allow this incident to affect his outer conduct any more

than the danger to his leaseholds had done, and went to bed as

usual.  Two simultaneous troubles do not always make a double

trouble; and thus it came to pass that Giles's practical anxiety

about his houses, which would have been enough to keep him awake

half the night at any other time, was displaced and not reinforced

by his sentimental trouble about Grace Melbury.  This severance

was in truth more like a burial of her than a rupture with her;

but he did not realize so much at present; even when he arose in

the morning he felt quite moody and stern: as yet the second note

in the gamut of such emotions, a tender regret for his loss, had

not made itself heard.



A load of oak timber was to be sent away that morning to a builder

whose works were in a town many miles off.  The proud trunks were

taken up from the silent spot which had known them through the

buddings and sheddings of their growth for the foregoing hundred

years; chained down like slaves to a heavy timber carriage with

enormous red wheels, and four of the most powerful of Melbury's

horses were harnessed in front to draw them.



The horses wore their bells that day.  There were sixteen to the

team, carried on a frame above each animal's shoulders, and tuned

to scale, so as to form two octaves, running from the highest note

on the right or off-side of the leader to the lowest on the left

or near-side of the shaft-horse.  Melbury was among the last to

retain horse-bells in that neighborhood; for, living at Little

Hintock, where the lanes yet remained as narrow as before the days

of turnpike roads, these sound-signals were still as useful to him

and his neighbors as they had ever been in former times.  Much

backing was saved in the course of a year by the warning notes

they cast ahead; moreover, the tones of all the teams in the

district being known to the carters of each, they could tell a

long way off on a dark night whether they were about to encounter

friends or strangers.



The fog of the previous evening still lingered so heavily over the

woods that the morning could not penetrate the trees till long

after its time.  The load being a ponderous one, the lane crooked,

and the air so thick, Winterborne set out, as he often did, to

accompany the team as far as the corner, where it would turn into

a wider road.



So they rumbled on, shaking the foundations of the roadside

cottages by the weight of their progress, the sixteen bells

chiming harmoniously over all, till they had risen out of the 

valley and were descending towards the more open route, the sparks

rising from their creaking skid and nearly setting fire to the

dead leaves alongside.



Then occurred one of the very incidents against which the bells

were an endeavor to guard.  Suddenly there beamed into their eyes,

quite close to them, the two lamps of a carriage, shorn of rays by

the fog.  Its approach had been quite unheard, by reason of their

own noise.  The carriage was a covered one, while behind it could

be discerned another vehicle laden with luggage.



Winterborne went to the head of the team, and heard the coachman

telling the carter that he must turn back.  The carter declared

that this was impossible.



"You can turn if you unhitch your string-horses," said the

coachman.



"It is much easier for you to turn than for us," said Winterborne. 

"We've five tons of timber on these wheels if we've an ounce."



"But I've another carriage with luggage at my back."



Winterborne admitted the strength of the argument.  "But even with

that," he said, "you can back better than we.  And you ought to,

for you could hear our bells half a mile off."



"And you could see our lights."



"We couldn't, because of the fog."



"Well, our time's precious," said the coachman, haughtily.  "You

are only going to some trumpery little village or other in the

neighborhood, while we are going straight to Italy."



"Driving all the way, I suppose," said Winterborne, sarcastically.



The argument continued in these terms till a voice from the

interior of the carriage inquired what was the matter.  It was a

lady's.



She was briefly informed of the timber people's obstinacy; and

then Giles could hear her telling the footman to direct the timber

people to turn their horses' heads.



The message was brought, and Winterborne sent the bearer back to

say that he begged the lady's pardon, but that he could not do as

she requested; that though he would not assert it to be

impossible, it was impossible by comparison with the slight

difficulty to her party to back their light carriages.  As fate

would have it, the incident with Grace Melbury on the previous day

made Giles less gentle than he might otherwise have shown himself,

his confidence in the sex being rudely shaken.



In fine, nothing could move him, and the carriages were compelled

to back till they reached one of the sidings or turnouts

constructed in the bank for the purpose.  Then the team came on

ponderously, and the clanging of its sixteen bells as it passed

the discomfited carriages, tilted up against the bank, lent a

particularly triumphant tone to the team's progress--a tone which,

in point of fact, did not at all attach to its conductor's

feelings.



Giles walked behind the timber, and just as he had got past the

yet stationary carriages he heard a soft voice say, "Who is that

rude man? Not Melbury?" The sex of the speaker was so prominent in

the voice that Winterborne felt a pang of regret.



"No, ma'am.  A younger man, in a smaller way of business in Little

Hintock.  Winterborne is his name."



Thus they parted company.  "Why, Mr. Winterborne," said the

wagoner, when they were out of hearing, "that was She--Mrs.

Charmond! Who'd ha' thought it? What in the world can a woman that

does nothing be cock-watching out here at this time o' day for?

Oh, going to Italy--yes to be sure, I heard she was going abroad,

she can't endure the winter here."



Winterborne was vexed at the incident; the more so that he knew

Mr. Melbury, in his adoration of Hintock House, would be the first

to blame him if it became known.  But saying no more, he

accompanied the load to the end of the lane, and then turned back

with an intention to call at South's to learn the result of the

experiment of the preceding evening.



It chanced that a few minutes before this time Grace Melbury, who

now rose soon enough to breakfast with her father, in spite of the

unwontedness of the hour, had been commissioned by him to make the

same inquiry at South's.  Marty had been standing at the door when

Miss Melbury arrived.  Almost before the latter had spoken, Mrs.

Charmond's carriages, released from the obstruction up the lane,

came bowling along, and the two girls turned to regard the

spectacle.



Mrs. Charmond did not see them, but there was sufficient light for

them to discern her outline between the carriage windows.  A

noticeable feature in her tournure was a magnificent mass of

braided locks.



"How well she looks this morning!" said Grace, forgetting Mrs.

Charmond's slight in her generous admiration.  "Her hair so

becomes her worn that way.  I have never seen any more beautiful!"



"Nor have I, miss," said Marty, dryly, unconsciously stroking her

crown.



Grace watched the carriages with lingering regret till they were

out of sight.  She then learned of Marty that South was no better. 

Before she had come away Winterborne approached the house, but

seeing that one of the two girls standing on the door-step was 

Grace, he suddenly turned back again and sought the shelter of his

own home till she should have gone away.
