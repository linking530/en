All the evening Melbury had been coming to his door, saying, "I

wonder where in the world that girl is! Never in all my born days

did I know her bide out like this!  She surely said she was going

into the garden to get some parsley."



Melbury searched the garden, the parsley-bed, and the orchard, but

could find no trace of her, and then he made inquiries at the

cottages of such of his workmen as had not gone to bed, avoiding

Tangs's because he knew the young people were to rise early to

leave.  In these inquiries one of the men's wives somewhat

incautiously let out the fact that she had heard a scream in the

wood, though from which direction she could not say.



This set Melbury's fears on end.  He told the men to light

lanterns, and headed by himself they started, Creedle following at

the last moment with quite a burden of grapnels and ropes, which

he could not be persuaded to leave behind, and the company being

joined by the hollow-turner and the man who kept the cider-house

as they went along.



They explored the precincts of the village, and in a short time

lighted upon the man-trap.  Its discovery simply added an item of

fact without helping their conjectures; but Melbury's indefinite

alarm was greatly increased when, holding a candle to the ground,

he saw in the teeth of the instrument some frayings from Grace's

clothing.  No intelligence of any kind was gained till they met a

woodman of Delborough, who said that he had seen a lady answering

to the description her father gave of Grace, walking through the

wood on a gentleman's arm in the direction of Sherton.



"Was he clutching her tight?" said Melbury.



"Well--rather," said the man.



"Did she walk lame?"



"Well, 'tis true her head hung over towards him a bit."



Creedle groaned tragically.



Melbury, not suspecting the presence of Fitzpiers, coupled this

account with the man-trap and the scream; he could not understand

what it all meant; but the sinister event of the trap made him

follow on.  Accordingly, they bore away towards the town, shouting

as they went, and in due course emerged upon the highway.



Nearing Sherton-Abbas, the previous information was confirmed by

other strollers, though the gentleman's supporting arm had

disappeared from these later accounts.  At last they were so near

Sherton that Melbury informed his faithful followers that he did

not wish to drag them farther at so late an hour, since he could

go on alone and inquire if the woman who had been seen were really

Grace.  But they would not leave him alone in his anxiety, and

trudged onward till the lamplight from the town began to

illuminate their fronts.  At the entrance to the High Street they

got fresh scent of the pursued, but coupled with the new condition

that the lady in the costume described had been going up the

street alone.



"Faith!--I believe she's mesmerized, or walking in her sleep,"

said Melbury.



However, the identity of this woman with Grace was by no means

certain; but they plodded along the street.  Percombe, the hair-

dresser, who had despoiled Marty of her tresses, was standing at

his door, and they duly put inquiries to him.



"Ah--how's Little Hintock folk by now?" he said, before replying. 

"Never have I been over there since one winter night some three

year ago--and then I lost myself finding it.  How can ye live in

such a one-eyed place?  Great Hintock is bad enough--hut Little

Hintock--the bats and owls would drive me melancholy-mad! It took

two days to raise my sperrits to their true pitch again after that

night I went there.  Mr. Melbury, sir, as a man's that put by

money, why not retire and live here, and see something of the

world?"



The responses at last given by him to their queries guided them to

the building that offered the best accommodation in Sherton--

having been enlarged contemporaneously with the construction of

the railway--namely, the Earl of Wessex Hotel.



Leaving the others without, Melbury made prompt inquiry here.  His

alarm was lessened, though his perplexity was increased, when he

received a brief reply that such a lady was in the house.



"Do you know if it is my daughter?" asked Melbury.



The waiter did not.



"Do you know the lady's name?"



Of this, too, the household was ignorant, the hotel having been

taken by brand-new people from a distance.  They knew the

gentleman very well by sight, and had not thought it necessary to

ask him to enter his name.



"Oh, the gentleman appears again now," said Melbury to himself. 

"Well, I want to see the lady," he declared.



A message was taken up, and after some delay the shape of Grace

appeared descending round the bend of the stair-case, looking as

if she lived there, but in other respects rather guilty and

frightened.



"Why--what the name--" began her father.  "I thought you went out

to get parsley!"



"Oh, yes--I did--but it is all right," said Grace, in a flurried

whisper.  "I am not alone here.  I am here with Edgar.  It is

entirely owing to an accident, father."



"Edgar! An accident! How does he come here?  I thought he was two

hundred mile off."



"Yes, so he is--I mean he has got a beautiful practice two hundred

miles off; he has bought it with his own money, some that came to

him.  But he travelled here, and I was nearly caught in a man-

trap, and that's how it is I am here.  We were just thinking of

sending a messenger to let you know."



Melbury did not seem to be particularly enlightened by this

explanation.



"You were caught in a man-trap?"



"Yes; my dress was.  That's how it arose.  Edgar is up-stairs in

his own sitting-room," she went on.  "He would not mind seeing

you, I am sure."



"Oh, faith, I don't want to see him! I have seen him too often

a'ready.  I'll see him another time, perhaps, if 'tis to oblige

'ee."



"He came to see me; he wanted to consult me about this large

partnership I speak of, as it is very promising."



"Oh, I am glad to hear it," said Melbury, dryly.



A pause ensued, during which the inquiring faces and whity-brown

clothes of Melbury's companions appeared in the door-way.



"Then bain't you coming home with us?" he asked.



"I--I think not," said Grace, blushing.



"H'm--very well--you are your own mistress," he returned, in tones

which seemed to assert otherwise.  "Good-night;" and Melbury

retreated towards the door.



"Don't be angry, father," she said, following him a few steps.  "I

have done it for the best."



"I am not angry, though it is true I have been a little misled in

this.  However, good-night.  I must get home along."



He left the hotel, not without relief, for to be under the eyes of

strangers while he conversed with his lost child had embarrassed

him much.  His search-party, too, had looked awkward there, having

rushed to the task of investigation--some in their shirt sleeves,

others in their leather aprons, and all much stained--just as they

had come from their work of barking, and not in their Sherton

marketing attire; while Creedle, with his ropes and grapnels and

air of impending tragedy, had added melancholy to gawkiness.



"Now, neighbors," said Melbury, on joining them, "as it is getting

late, we'll leg it home again as fast as we can.  I ought to tell

you that there has been some mistake--some arrangement entered

into between Mr. and Mrs. Fitzpiers which I didn't quite

understand--an important practice in the Midland counties has come

to him, which made it necessary for her to join him to-night--so

she says.  That's all it was--and I'm sorry I dragged you out."



"Well," said the hollow-turner, "here be we six mile from home,

and night-time, and not a hoss or four-footed creeping thing to

our name.  I say, we'll have a mossel and a drop o' summat to

strengthen our nerves afore we vamp all the way back again?  My

throat's as dry as a kex.  What d'ye say so's?"



They all concurred in the need for this course, and proceeded to

the antique and lampless back street, in which the red curtain of

the Three Tuns was the only radiant object.  As soon as they had

stumbled down into the room Melbury ordered them to be served,

when they made themselves comfortable by the long table, and

stretched out their legs upon the herring-boned sand of the floor. 

Melbury himself, restless as usual, walked to the door while he

waited for them, and looked up and down the street.



"I'd gie her a good shaking if she were my maid; pretending to go

out in the garden, and leading folk a twelve-mile traipse that

have got to get up at five o'clock to morrow," said a bark-ripper;

who, not working regularly for Melbury, could afford to indulge in

strong opinions.



"I don't speak so warm as that," said the hollow-turner, "but if

'tis right for couples to make a country talk about their

separating, and excite the neighbors, and then make fools of 'em

like this, why, I haven't stood upon one leg for five-and-twenty

year."



All his listeners knew that when he alluded to his foot-lathe in

these enigmatic terms, the speaker meant to be impressive; and

Creedle chimed in with, "Ah, young women do wax wanton in these

days! Why couldn't she ha' bode with her father, and been

faithful?" Poor Creedle was thinking of his old employer.



"But this deceiving of folks is nothing unusual in matrimony,"

said Farmer Bawtree.  "I knowed a man and wife--faith, I don't

mind owning, as there's no strangers here, that the pair were my

own relations--they'd be at it that hot one hour that you'd hear

the poker and the tongs and the bellows and the warming-pan flee

across the house with the movements of their vengeance; and the

next hour you'd hear 'em singing 'The Spotted Cow' together as

peaceable as two holy twins; yes--and very good voices they had,

and would strike in like professional ballet-singers to one

another's support in the high notes."



"And I knowed a woman, and the husband o' her went away for four-

and-twenty year," said the bark-ripper.  "And one night he came

home when she was sitting by the fire, and thereupon he sat down

himself on the other side of the chimney-corner.  'Well,' says

she, 'have ye got any news?'  'Don't know as I have,' says he;

'have you?'  'No,' says she, 'except that my daughter by my second

husband was married last month, which was a year after I was made

a widow by him.'  'Oh! Anything else?' he says.  'No,' says she. 

And there they sat, one on each side of that chimney-corner, and

were found by their neighbors sound asleep in their chairs, not

having known what to talk about at all."



"Well, I don't care who the man is," said Creedle, "they required

a good deal to talk about, and that's true.  It won't be the same

with these."



"No.  He is such a projick, you see.  And she is a wonderful

scholar too!"



"What women do know nowadays!" observed the hollow-turner.  "You

can't deceive 'em as you could in my time."



"What they knowed then was not small," said John Upjohn.  "Always

a good deal more than the men! Why, when I went courting my wife

that is now, the skilfulness that she would show in keeping me on

her pretty side as she walked was beyond all belief.  Perhaps

you've noticed that she's got a pretty side to her face as well as

a plain one?"



"I can't say I've noticed it particular much," said the hollow-

turner, blandly.



"Well," continued Upjohn, not disconcerted, "she has.  All women

under the sun be prettier one side than t'other.  And, as I was

saying, the pains she would take to make me walk on the pretty

side were unending! I warrant that whether we were going with the

sun or against the sun, uphill or downhill, in wind or in lewth,

that wart of hers was always towards the hedge, and that dimple

towards me.  There was I, too simple to see her wheelings and

turnings; and she so artful, though two years younger, that she

could lead me with a cotton thread, like a blind ram; for that was

in the third climate of our courtship.  No; I don't think the

women have got cleverer, for they was never otherwise."



"How many climates may there be in courtship, Mr. Upjohn?"

inquired a youth--the same who had assisted at Winterborne's

Christmas party.



"Five--from the coolest to the hottest--leastwise there was five

in mine."



"Can ye give us the chronicle of 'em, Mr. Upjohn?"



"Yes--I could.  I could certainly.  But 'tis quite unnecessary. 

They'll come to ye by nater, young man, too soon for your good."



"At present Mrs. Fitzpiers can lead the doctor as your mis'ess

could lead you," the hollow-turner remarked.  "She's got him quite

tame.  But how long 'twill last I can't say.  I happened to be

setting a wire on the top of my garden one night when he met her

on the other side of the hedge; and the way she queened it, and

fenced, and kept that poor feller at a distance, was enough to

freeze yer blood.  I should never have supposed it of such a

girl."



Melbury now returned to the room, and the men having declared

themselves refreshed, they all started on the homeward journey,

which was by no means cheerless under the rays of the high moon. 

Having to walk the whole distance they came by a foot-path rather

shorter than the highway, though difficult except to those who

knew the country well.  This brought them by way of Great Hintock;

and passing the church-yard they observed, as they talked, a

motionless figure standing by the gate.



"I think it was Marty South," said the hollow-turner,

parenthetically.



"I think 'twas; 'a was always a lonely maid," said Upjohn.  And

they passed on homeward, and thought of the matter no more.



It was Marty, as they had supposed.  That evening had been the

particular one of the week upon which Grace and herself had been

accustomed to privately deposit flowers on Giles's grave, and this

was the first occasion since his death, eight months earlier, on

which Grace had failed to keep her appointment.  Marty had waited

in the road just outside Little Hintock, where her fellow-pilgrim

had been wont to join her, till she was weary; and at last,

thinking that Grace had missed her and gone on alone, she followed

the way to Great Hintock, but saw no Grace in front of her.  It

got later, and Marty continued her walk till she reached the

church-yard gate; but still no Grace.  Yet her sense of

comradeship would not allow her to go on to the grave alone, and

still thinking the delay had been unavoidable, she stood there

with her little basket of flowers in her clasped hands, and her

feet chilled by the damp ground, till more than two hours had

passed.



She then heard the footsteps of Melbury's men, who presently

passed on their return from the search.  In the silence of the

night Marty could not help hearing fragments of their

conversation, from which she acquired a general idea of what had

occurred, and where Mrs. Fitzpiers then was.



Immediately they had dropped down the hill she entered the church-

yard, going to a secluded corner behind the bushes, where rose the

unadorned stone that marked the last bed of Giles Winterborne.  As

this solitary and silent girl stood there in the moonlight, a

straight slim figure, clothed in a plaitless gown, the contours of

womanhood so undeveloped as to be scarcely perceptible, the marks

of poverty and toil effaced by the misty hour, she touched

sublimity at points, and looked almost like a being who had

rejected with indifference the attribute of sex for the loftier

quality of abstract humanism.  She stooped down and cleared away

the withered flowers that Grace and herself had laid there the

previous week, and put her fresh ones in their place.



"Now, my own, own love," she whispered, "you are mine, and on'y

mine; for she has forgot 'ee at last, although for her you died. 

But I--whenever I get up I'll think of 'ee, and whenever I lie

down I'll think of 'ee.  Whenever I plant the young larches I'll

think that none can plant as you planted; and whenever I split a

gad, and whenever I turn the cider-wring, I'll say none could do

it like you.  If ever I forget your name, let me forget home and

Heaven!--But no, no, my love, I never can forget 'ee; for you was

a GOOD man, and did good things!"
