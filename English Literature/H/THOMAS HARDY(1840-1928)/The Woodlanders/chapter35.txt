The mare paced along with firm and cautious tread through the

copse where Winterborne had worked, and into the heavier soil

where the oaks grew; past Great Willy, the largest oak in the

wood, and thence towards Nellcombe Bottom, intensely dark now with

overgrowth, and popularly supposed to be haunted by the spirits of

the fratricides exorcised from Hintock House.



By this time Fitzpiers was quite recovered as to physical

strength.  But he had eaten nothing since making a hasty breakfast

in London that morning, his anxiety about Felice having hurried

him away from home before dining; as a consequence, the old rum

administered by his father-in-law flew to the young man's head and

loosened his tongue, without his ever having recognized who it was

that had lent him a kindly hand.  He began to speak in desultory

sentences, Melbury still supporting him.



"I've come all the way from London to-day," said Fitzpiers.  "Ah,

that's the place to meet your equals.  I live at Hintock--worse,

at Little Hintock--and I am quite lost there.  There's not a man

within ten miles of Hintock who can comprehend me.  I tell you,

Farmer What's-your-name, that I'm a man of education.  I know

several languages; the poets and I are familiar friends; I used to

read more in metaphysics than anybody within fifty miles; and

since I gave that up there's nobody can match me in the whole

county of Wessex as a scientist.  Yet I an doomed to live with

tradespeople in a miserable little hole like Hintock!"



"Indeed!" muttered Melbury.



Fitzpiers, increasingly energized by the alcohol, here reared

himself up suddenly from the bowed posture he had hitherto held,

thrusting his shoulders so violently against Melbury's breast as

to make it difficult for the old man to keep a hold on the reins. 

"People don't appreciate me here!" the surgeon exclaimed; lowering

his voice, he added, softly and slowly, "except one--except

one!...A passionate soul, as warm as she is clever, as beautiful

as she is warm, and as rich as she is beautiful.  I say, old

fellow, those claws of yours clutch me rather tight--rather like

the eagle's, you know, that ate out the liver of Pro--Pre--the man

on Mount Caucasus.  People don't appreciate me, I say, except HER. 

Ah, gods, I am an unlucky man!  She would have been mine, she

would have taken my name; but unfortunately it cannot be so.  I

stooped to mate beneath me, and now I rue it."



The position was becoming a very trying one for Melbury,

corporeally and mentally.  He was obliged to steady Fitzpiers with

his left arm, and he began to hate the contact.  He hardly knew

what to do.  It was useless to remonstrate with Fitzpiers, in his

intellectual confusion from the rum and from the fall.  He

remained silent, his hold upon his companion, however, being stern

rather than compassionate.



"You hurt me a little, farmer--though I am much obliged to you for

your kindness.  People don't appreciate me, I say.  Between

ourselves, I am losing my practice here; and why?  Because I see

matchless attraction where matchless attraction is, both in person

and position.  I mention no names, so nobody will be the wiser. 

But I have lost her, in a legitimate sense, that is.  If I were a

free man now, things have come to such a pass that she could not

refuse me; while with her fortune (which I don't covet for itself)

I should have a chance of satisfying an honorable ambition--a

chance I have never had yet, and now never, never shall have,

probably!"



Melbury, his heart throbbing against the other's backbone, and his

brain on fire with indignation, ventured to mutter huskily, "Why?"



The horse ambled on some steps before Fitzpiers replied, "Because

I am tied and bound to another by law, as tightly as I am to you

by your arm--not that I complain of your arm--I thank you for

helping me.  Well, where are we?  Not nearly home yet?...Home, say

I.  It is a home!  When I might have been at the other house over

there."  In a stupefied way he flung his hand in the direction of

the park.  "I was just two months too early in committing myself. 

Had I only seen the other first--"



Here the old man's arm gave Fitzpiers a convulsive shake.  "What

are you doing?" continued the latter.  "Keep still, please, or put

me down.  I was saying that I lost her by a mere little two

months! There is no chance for me now in this world, and it makes

me reckless--reckless! Unless, indeed, anything should happen to

the other one.  She is amiable enough; but if anything should

happen to her--and I hear she is ill--well, if it should, I should

be free--and my fame, my happiness, would be insured."



These were the last words that Fitzpiers uttered in his seat in

front of the timber-merchant.  Unable longer to master himself,

Melbury, the skin of his face compressed, whipped away his spare

arm from Fitzpiers's waist, and seized him by the collar.



"You heartless villain--after all that we have done for ye!" he

cried, with a quivering lip.  "And the money of hers that you've

had, and the roof we've provided to shelter ye! It is to me,

George Melbury, that you dare to talk like that!" The exclamation

was accompanied by a powerful swing from the shoulder, which flung

the young man head-long into the road, Fitzpiers fell with a heavy

thud upon the stumps of some undergrowth which had been cut during

the winter preceding.  Darling continued her walk for a few paces

farther and stopped.



"God forgive me!" Melbury murmured, repenting of what he had done. 

"He tried me too sorely; and now perhaps I've murdered him!"



He turned round in the saddle and looked towards the spot on which

Fitzpiers had fallen.  To his great surprise he beheld the surgeon

rise to his feet with a bound, as if unhurt, and walk away rapidly

under the trees.



Melbury listened till the rustle of Fitzpiers's footsteps died

away.  "It might have been a crime, but for the mercy of

Providence in providing leaves for his fall," he said to himself. 

And then his mind reverted to the words of Fitzpiers, and his

indignation so mounted within him that he almost wished the fall

had put an end to the young man there and then.



He had not ridden far when he discerned his own gray mare standing

under some bushes.  Leaving Darling for a moment, Melbury went

forward and easily caught the younger animal, now disheartened at

its freak.  He then made the pair of them fast to a tree, and

turning back, endeavored to find some trace of Fitzpiers, feeling

pitifully that, after all, he had gone further than he intended

with the offender.



But though he threaded the wood hither and thither, his toes

ploughing layer after layer of the little horny scrolls that had

once been leaves, he could not find him.  He stood still listening

and looking round.  The breeze was oozing through the network of

boughs as through a strainer; the trunks and larger branches stood

against the light of the sky in the forms of writhing men,

gigantic candelabra, pikes, halberds, lances, and whatever besides

the fancy chose to make of them.  Giving up the search, Melbury

came back to the horses, and walked slowly homeward, leading one

in each hand.







It happened that on this self-same evening a boy had been

returning from Great to Little Hintock about the time of

Fitzpiers's and Melbury's passage home along that route.  A horse-

collar that had been left at the harness-mender's to be repaired

was required for use at five o'clock next morning, and in

consequence the boy had to fetch it overnight.  He put his head

through the collar, and accompanied his walk by whistling the one

tune he knew, as an antidote to fear.



The boy suddenly became aware of a horse trotting rather friskily

along the track behind him, and not knowing whether to expect

friend or foe, prudence suggested that he should cease his

whistling and retreat among the trees till the horse and his rider

had gone by; a course to which he was still more inclined when he

found how noiselessly they approached, and saw that the horse

looked pale, and remembered what he had read about Death in the

Revelation.  He therefore deposited the collar by a tree, and hid

himself behind it.  The horseman came on, and the youth, whose

eyes were as keen as telescopes, to his great relief recognized

the doctor.



As Melbury surmised, Fitzpiers had in the darkness taken Blossom

for Darling, and he had not discovered his mistake when he came up

opposite the boy, though he was somewhat surprised at the

liveliness of his usually placid mare.  The only other pair of

eyes on the spot whose vision was keen as the young carter's were

those of the horse; and, with that strongly conservative objection

to the unusual which animals show, Blossom, on eying the collar

under the tree--quite invisible to Fitzpiers--exercised none of

the patience of the older horse, but shied sufficiently to unseat

so second-rate an equestrian as the surgeon.



He fell, and did not move, lying as Melbury afterwards found him. 

The boy ran away, salving his conscience for the desertion by

thinking how vigorously he would spread the alarm of the accident

when he got to Hintock--which he uncompromisingly did, incrusting

the skeleton event with a load of dramatic horrors.



Grace had returned, and the fly hired on her account, though not

by her husband, at the Crown Hotel, Shottsford-Forum, had been

paid for and dismissed.  The long drive had somewhat revived her,

her illness being a feverish intermittent nervousness which had

more to do with mind than body, and she walked about her sitting-

room in something of a hopeful mood.  Mrs. Melbury had told her as

soon as she arrived that her husband had returned from London.  He

had gone out, she said, to see a patient, as she supposed, and he

must soon be back, since he had had no dinner or tea.  Grace would

not allow her mind to harbor any suspicion of his whereabouts, and

her step-mother said nothing of Mrs. Charmond's rumored sorrows

and plans of departure.



So the young wife sat by the fire, waiting silently.  She had left

Hintock in a turmoil of feeling after the revelation of Mrs.

Charmond, and had intended not to be at home when her husband

returned.  But she had thought the matter over, and had allowed

her father's influence to prevail and bring her back; and now

somewhat regretted that Edgar's arrival had preceded hers.



By-and-by Mrs. Melbury came up-stairs with a slight air of flurry

and abruptness.



"I have something to tell--some bad news," she said.  "But you

must not be alarmed, as it is not so bad as it might have been. 

Edgar has been thrown off his horse.  We don't think he is hurt

much.  It happened in the wood the other side of Nellcombe Bottom,

where 'tis said the ghosts of the brothers walk."



She went on to give a few of the particulars, but none of the

invented horrors that had been communicated by the boy.  "I

thought it better to tell you at once," she added, "in case he

should not be very well able to walk home, and somebody should

bring him."



Mrs. Melbury really thought matters much worse than she

represented, and Grace knew that she thought so.  She sat down

dazed for a few minutes, returning a negative to her step-mother's

inquiry if she could do anything for her.  "But please go into the

bedroom," Grace said, on second thoughts, "and see if all is ready

there--in case it is serious." Mrs. Melbury thereupon called

Grammer, and they did as directed, supplying the room with

everything they could think of for the accommodation of an injured

man.



Nobody was left in the lower part of the house.  Not many minutes

passed when Grace heard a knock at the door--a single knock, not

loud enough to reach the ears of those in the bedroom.  She went

to the top of the stairs and said, faintly, "Come up," knowing

that the door stood, as usual in such houses, wide open.



Retreating into the gloom of the broad landing she saw rise up the

stairs a woman whom at first she did not recognize, till her voice

revealed her to be Suke Damson, in great fright and sorrow.  A

streak of light from the partially closed door of Grace's room

fell upon her face as she came forward, and it was drawn and pale.



"Oh, Miss Melbury--I would say Mrs. Fitzpiers," she said, wringing

her hands.  "This terrible news.  Is he dead? Is he hurted very

bad? Tell me; I couldn't help coming; please forgive me, Miss

Melbury--Mrs. Fitzpiers I would say!"



Grace sank down on the oak chest which stood on the landing, and

put her hands to her now flushed face and head.  Could she order

Suke Damson down-stairs and out of the house? Her husband might be

brought in at any moment, and what would happen? But could she

order this genuinely grieved woman away?



There was a dead silence of half a minute or so, till Suke said,

"Why don't ye speak? Is he here? Is he dead? If so, why can't I

see him--would it be so very wrong?"



Before Grace had answered somebody else came to the door below--a

foot-fall light as a roe's.  There was a hurried tapping upon the

panel, as if with the impatient tips of fingers whose owner

thought not whether a knocker were there or no.  Without a pause,

and possibly guided by the stray beam of light on the landing, the

newcomer ascended the staircase as the first had done.  Grace was

sufficiently visible, and the lady, for a lady it was, came to her

side.



"I could make nobody hear down-stairs," said Felice Charmond, with

lips whose dryness could almost be heard, and panting, as she

stood like one ready to sink on the floor with distress.  "What

is--the matter--tell me the worst! Can he live?" She looked at

Grace imploringly, without perceiving poor Suke, who, dismayed at

such a presence, had shrunk away into the shade.



Mrs. Charmond's little feet were covered with mud; she was quite

unconscious of her appearance now.  "I have heard such a dreadful

report," she went on; "I came to ascertain the truth of it.  Is

he--killed?"



"She won't tell us--he's dying--he's in that room!" burst out

Suke, regardless of consequences, as she heard the distant

movements of Mrs. Melbury and Grammer in the bedroom at the end of

the passage.



"Where?" said Mrs. Charmond; and on Suke pointing out the

direction, she made as if to go thither.



Grace barred the way.  "He is not there," she said.  "I have not

seen him any more than you.  I have heard a report only--not so

bad as you think.  It must have been exaggerated to you."



"Please do not conceal anything--let me know all!" said Felice,

doubtingly.



"You shall know all I know--you have a perfect right to know--who

can have a better than either of you?" said Grace, with a delicate

sting which was lost upon Felice Charmond now.  "I repeat, I have

only heard a less alarming account than you have heard; how much

it means, and how little, I cannot say.  I pray God that it means

not much--in common humanity.  You probably pray the same--for

other reasons."



She regarded them both there in the dim light a while.



They stood dumb in their trouble, not stinging back at her; not

heeding her mood.  A tenderness spread over Grace like a dew.  It

was well, very well, conventionally, to address either one of them

in the wife's regulation terms of virtuous sarcasm, as woman,

creature, or thing, for losing their hearts to her husband.  But

life, what was it, and who was she?  She had, like the singer of

the psalm of Asaph, been plagued and chastened all the day long;

but could she, by retributive words, in order to please herself--

the individual--"offend against the generation," as he would not?



"He is dying, perhaps," blubbered Suke Damson, putting her apron

to her eyes.



In their gestures and faces there were anxieties, affection, agony

of heart, all for a man who had wronged them--had never really

behaved towards either of them anyhow but selfishly.  Neither one

but would have wellnigh sacrificed half her life to him, even now. 

The tears which his possibly critical situation could not bring to

her eyes surged over at the contemplation of these fellow-women. 

She turned to the balustrade, bent herself upon it, and wept.



Thereupon Felice began to cry also, without using her

handkerchief, and letting the tears run down silently.  While

these three poor women stood together thus, pitying another though

most to be pitied themselves, the pacing of a horse or horses

became audible in the court, and in a moment Melbury's voice was

heard calling to his stableman.  Grace at once started up, ran

down the stairs and out into the quadrangle as her father crossed

it towards the door.  "Father, what is the matter with him?" she

cried.



"Who--Edgar?" said Melbury, abruptly.  "Matter? Nothing.  What, my

dear, and have you got home safe? Why, you are better already! But

you ought not to be out in the air like this."



"But he has been thrown off his horse!"



"I know; I know.  I saw it.  He got up again, and walked off as

well as ever.  A fall on the leaves didn't hurt a spry fellow like

him.  He did not come this way," he added, significantly.  "I

suppose he went to look for his horse.  I tried to find him, but

could not.  But after seeing him go away under the trees I found

the horse, and have led it home for safety.  So he must walk. 

Now, don't you stay out here in this night air.



She returned to the house with her father.  when she had again

ascended to the landing and to her own rooms beyond it was a great

relief to her to find that both Petticoat the First and Petticoat

the Second of her Bien-aime had silently disappeared.  They had,

in all probability, heard the words of her father, and departed

with their anxieties relieved.



Presently her parents came up to Grace, and busied themselves to

see that she was comfortable.  Perceiving soon that she would

prefer to be left alone they went away.



Grace waited on.  The clock raised its voice now and then, but her

husband did not return.  At her father's usual hour for retiring

he again came in to see her.  "Do not stay up," she said, as soon

as he entered.  "I am not at all tired.  I will sit up for him."



"I think it will be useless, Grace," said Melbury, slowly.



"Why?"



"I have had a bitter quarrel with him; and on that account I

hardly think he will return to-night."



"A quarrel?  Was that after the fall seen by the boy?"



Melbury nodded an affirmative, without taking his eyes off the

candle.



"Yes; it was as we were coming home together," he said.



Something had been swelling up in Grace while her father was

speaking.  "How could you want to quarrel with him?" she cried,

suddenly.  "Why could you not let him come home quietly if he were

inclined to?  He is my husband; and now you have married me to him

surely you need not provoke him unnecessarily.  First you induce

me to accept him, and then you do things that divide us more than

we should naturally be divided!"



"How can you speak so unjustly to me, Grace?" said Melbury, with

indignant sorrow.  "I divide you from your husband, indeed!  You

little think--"



He was inclined to say more--to tell her the whole story of the

encounter, and that the provocation he had received had lain

entirely in hearing her despised.  But it would have greatly

distressed her, and he forbore.  "You had better lie down.  You

are tired," he said, soothingly.  "Good-night."



The household went to bed, and a silence fell upon the dwelling,

broken only by the occasional skirr of a halter in Melbury's

stables.  Despite her father's advice Grace still waited up.  But

nobody came.



It was a critical time in Grace's emotional life that night.  She

thought of her husband a good deal, and for the nonce forgot

Winterborne.



"How these unhappy women must have admired Edgar!" she said to

herself.  "How attractive he must be to everybody; and, indeed, he

is attractive." The possibility is that, piqued by rivalry, these

ideas might have been transformed into their corresponding

emotions by a show of the least reciprocity in Fitzpiers.  There

was, in truth, a love-bird yearning to fly from her heart; and it

wanted a lodging badly.



But no husband came.  The fact was that Melbury had been much

mistaken about the condition of Fitzpiers.  People do not fall

headlong on stumps of underwood with impunity.  Had the old man

been able to watch Fitzpiers narrowly enough, he would have

observed that on rising and walking into the thicket he dropped

blood as he went; that he had not proceeded fifty yards before he

showed signs of being dizzy, and, raising his hands to his head,

reeled and fell down.
