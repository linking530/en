Weeks and months of mourning for Winterborne had been passed by

Grace in the soothing monotony of the memorial act to which she

and Marty had devoted themselves.  Twice a week the pair went in

the dusk to Great Hintock, and, like the two mourners in

Cymbeline, sweetened his sad grave with their flowers and their

tears.  Sometimes Grace thought that it was a pity neither one of

them had been his wife for a little while, and given the world a

copy of him who was so valuable in their eyes.  Nothing ever had

brought home to her with such force as this death how little

acquirements and culture weigh beside sterling personal character. 

While her simple sorrow for his loss took a softer edge with the

lapse of the autumn and winter seasons, her self-reproach at

having had a possible hand in causing it knew little abatement.



Little occurred at Hintock during these months of the fall and

decay of the leaf.  Discussion of the almost contemporaneous death

of Mrs. Charmond abroad had waxed and waned.  Fitzpiers had had a

marvellous escape from being dragged into the inquiry which

followed it, through the accident of their having parted just

before under the influence of Marty South's letter--the tiny

instrument of a cause deep in nature.



Her body was not brought home.  It seemed to accord well with the

fitful fever of that impassioned woman's life that she should not

have found a native grave.  She had enjoyed but a life-interest in

the estate, which, after her death, passed to a relative of her

husband's--one who knew not Felice, one whose purpose seemed to be

to blot out every vestige of her.



On a certain day in February--the cheerful day of St. Valentine,

in fact--a letter reached Mrs. Fitzpiers, which had been mentally

promised her for that particular day a long time before.



It announced that Fitzpiers was living at some midland town, where

he had obtained a temporary practice as assistant to some local

medical man, whose curative principles were all wrong, though he

dared not set them right.  He had thought fit to communicate with

her on that day of tender traditions to inquire if, in the event

of his obtaining a substantial practice that he had in view

elsewhere, she could forget the past and bring herself to join

him.



There the practical part ended; he then went on--





"My last year of experience has added ten years to my age, dear

Grace and dearest wife that ever erring man undervalued.  You may

be absolutely indifferent to what I say, but let me say it: I have

never loved any woman alive or dead as I love, respect, and honor

you at this present moment.  What you told me in the pride and

haughtiness of your heart I never believed [this, by the way, was

not strictly true]; but even if I had believed it, it could never

have estranged me from you.  Is there any use in telling you--no,

there is not--that I dream of your ripe lips more frequently than

I say my prayers; that the old familiar rustle of your dress often

returns upon my mind till it distracts me? If you could condescend

even only to see me again you would be breathing life into a

corpse.  My pure, pure Grace, modest as a turtledove, how came I

ever to possess you? For the sake of being present in your mind on

this lovers' day, I think I would almost rather have you hate me a 

little than not think of me at all.  You may call my fancies

whimsical; but remember, sweet, lost one, that 'nature is one in

love, and where 'tis fine it sends some instance of itself.'  I

will not intrude upon you further now.  Make me a little bit happy

by sending back one line to say that you will consent, at any

rate, to a short interview.  I will meet you and leave you as a

mere acquaintance, if you will only afford me this slight means of

making a few explanations, and of putting my position before you. 

Believe me, in spite of all you may do or feel,   Your lover

always (once your husband),



                                               "E."





It was, oddly enough, the first occasion, or nearly the first on

which Grace had ever received a love-letter from him, his

courtship having taken place under conditions which rendered

letter-writing unnecessary.  Its perusal, therefore, had a certain

novelty for her.  She thought that, upon the whole, he wrote love-

letters very well.  But the chief rational interest of the letter

to the reflective Grace lay in the chance that such a meeting as

he proposed would afford her of setting her doubts at rest, one

way or the other, on her actual share in Winterborne's death.  The

relief of consulting a skilled mind, the one professional man who

had seen Giles at that time, would be immense.  As for that

statement that she had uttered in her disdainful grief, which at

the time she had regarded as her triumph, she was quite prepared

to admit to him that his belief was the true one; for in wronging

herself as she did when she made it, she had done what to her was

a far more serious thing, wronged Winterborne's memory.



Without consulting her father, or any one in the house or out of

it, Grace replied to the letter.  She agreed to meet Fitzpiers on

two conditions, of which the first was that the place of meeting

should be the top of Rubdown Hill, the second that he would not

object to Marty South accompanying her.



Whatever part, much or little, there may have been in Fitzpiers's

so-called valentine to his wife, he felt a delight as of the

bursting of spring when her brief reply came.  It was one of the

few pleasures that he had experienced of late years at all

resembling those of his early youth.  He promptly replied that he

accepted the conditions, and named the day and hour at which he

would be on the spot she mentioned.



A few minutes before three on the appointed day found him climbing

the well-known hill, which had been the axis of so many critical

movements in their lives during his residence at Hintock.



The sight of each homely and well-remembered object swelled the

regret that seldom left him now.  Whatever paths might lie open to

his future, the soothing shades of Hintock were forbidden him

forever as a permanent dwelling-place.



He longed for the society of Grace.  But to lay offerings on her

slighted altar was his first aim, and until her propitiation was

complete he would constrain her in no way to return to him.  The

least reparation that he could make, in a case where he would

gladly have made much, would be to let her feel herself absolutely

free to choose between living with him and without him.



Moreover, a subtlist in emotions, he cultivated as under glasses

strange and mournful pleasures that he would not willingly let die

just at present.  To show any forwardness in suggesting a modus

vivendi to Grace would be to put an end to these exotics.  To be

the vassal of her sweet will for a time, he demanded no more, and

found solace in the contemplation of the soft miseries she caused

him.



Approaching the hill-top with a mind strung to these notions,

Fitzpiers discerned a gay procession of people coming over the

crest, and was not long in perceiving it to be a wedding-party.



Though the wind was keen the women were in light attire, and the

flowered waistcoats of the men had a pleasing vividness of

pattern.  Each of the gentler ones clung to the arm of her partner

so tightly as to have with him one step, rise, swing, gait, almost

one centre of gravity.  In the buxom bride Fitzpiers recognized no

other than Suke Damson, who in her light gown looked a giantess;

the small husband beside her he saw to be Tim Tangs.



Fitzpiers could not escape, for they had seen him; though of all

the beauties of the world whom he did not wish to meet Suke was

the chief.  But he put the best face on the matter that he could

and came on, the approaching company evidently discussing him and

his separation from Mrs. Fitzpiers.  As the couples closed upon

him he expressed his congratulations.



"We be just walking round the parishes to show ourselves a bit,"

said Tim.  "First we het across to Delborough, then athwart to

here, and from here we go to Rubdown and Millshot, and then round

by the cross-roads home.  Home says I, but it won't be that long!

We be off next month."



"Indeed.  Where to?"



Tim informed him that they were going to New Zealand.  Not but

that he would have been contented with Hintock, but his wife was

ambitious and wanted to leave, so he had given way.



"Then good-by," said Fitzpiers; "I may not see you again." He

shook hands with Tim and turned to the bride.  "Good-by, Suke," he

said, taking her hand also.  "I wish you and your husband

prosperity in the country you have chosen."  With this he left

them, and hastened on to his appointment.



The wedding-party re-formed and resumed march likewise.  But in

restoring his arm to Suke, Tim noticed that her full and blooming

countenance had undergone a change.  "Holloa! me dear--what's the

matter?" said Tim.



"Nothing to speak o'," said she.  But to give the lie to her

assertion she was seized with lachrymose twitches, that soon

produced a dribbling face.



"How--what the devil's this about!" exclaimed the bridegroom.



"She's a little wee bit overcome, poor dear!" said the first

bridesmaid, unfolding her handkerchief and wiping Suke's eyes.



"I never did like parting from people!" said Suke, as soon as she

could speak.



"Why him in particular?"



"Well--he's such a clever doctor, that 'tis a thousand pities we

sha'n't see him any more! There'll be no such clever doctor as he

in New Zealand, if I should require one; and the thought o't got

the better of my feelings!"



They walked on, but Tim's face had grown rigid and pale, for he

recalled slight circumstances, disregarded at the time of their

occurrence.  The former boisterous laughter of the wedding-party

at the groomsman's jokes was heard ringing through the woods no

more.



By this time Fitzpiers had advanced on his way to the top of the

hill, where he saw two figures emerging from the bank on the right

hand.  These were the expected ones, Grace and Marty South, who

had evidently come there by a short and secret path through the

wood.  Grace was muffled up in her winter dress, and he thought

that she had never looked so seductive as at this moment, in the

noontide bright but heatless sun, and the keen wind, and the

purplish-gray masses of brushwood around.



Fitzpiers continued to regard the nearing picture, till at length

their glances met for a moment, when she demurely sent off hers at

a tangent and gave him the benefit of her three-quarter face,

while with courteous completeness of conduct he lifted his hat in

a large arc.  Marty dropped behind; and when Fitzpiers held out

his hand, Grace touched it with her fingers.



"I have agreed to be here mostly because I wanted to ask you

something important," said Mrs. Fitzpiers, her intonation

modulating in a direction that she had not quite wished it to

take.



"I am most attentive," said her husband.  "Shall we take to the

wood for privacy?"



Grace demurred, and Fitzpiers gave in, and they kept the public

road.



At any rate she would take his arm?  This also was gravely

negatived, the refusal being audible to Marty.



"Why not?" he inquired.



"Oh, Mr. Fitzpiers--how can you ask?"



"Right, right," said he, his effusiveness shrivelled up.



As they walked on she returned to her inquiry.  "It is about a

matter that may perhaps be unpleasant to you.  But I think I need

not consider that too carefully."



"Not at all," said Fitzpiers, heroically.



She then took him back to the time of poor Winterborne's death,

and related the precise circumstances amid which his fatal illness

had come upon him, particularizing the dampness of the shelter to

which he had betaken himself, his concealment from her of the

hardships that he was undergoing, all that he had put up with, all

that he had done for her in his scrupulous considerateness.  The

retrospect brought her to tears as she asked him if he thought

that the sin of having driven him to his death was upon her.



Fitzpiers could hardly help showing his satisfaction at what her

narrative indirectly revealed, the actual harmlessness of an

escapade with her lover, which had at first, by her own showing,

looked so grave, and he did not care to inquire whether that

harmlessness had been the result of aim or of accident.  With

regard to her question, he declared that in his judgment no human

being could answer it.  He thought that upon the whole the balance

of probabilities turned in her favor.  Winterborne's apparent

strength, during the last months of his life, must have been

delusive.  It had often occurred that after a first attack of that

insidious disease a person's apparent recovery was a physiological

mendacity.



The relief which came to Grace lay almost as much in sharing her

knowledge of the particulars with an intelligent mind as in the

assurances Fitzpiers gave her.  "Well, then, to put this case

before you, and obtain your professional opinion, was chiefly why

I consented to come here to-day," said she, when he had reached

the aforesaid conclusion.



"For no other reason at all?" he asked, ruefully.



"It was nearly the whole."



They stood and looked over a gate at twenty or thirty starlings

feeding in the grass, and he started the talk again by saying, in

a low voice, "And yet I love you more than ever I loved you in my

life."



Grace did not move her eyes from the birds, and folded her

delicate lips as if to keep them in subjection.



"It is a different kind of love altogether," said he.  "Less

passionate; more profound.  It has nothing to do with the material

conditions of the object at all; much to do with her character and

goodness, as revealed by closer observation.  'Love talks with

better knowledge, and knowledge with dearer love.'"



"That's out of 'Measure for Measure,'" said she, slyly.



"Oh yes--I meant it as a citation," blandly replied Fitzpiers. 

"Well, then, why not give me a very little bit of your heart

again?"



The crash of a felled tree in the remote depths of the wood

recalled the past at that moment, and all the homely faithfulness

of Winterborne.  "Don't ask it! My heart is in the grave with

Giles," she replied, stanchly.



"Mine is with you--in no less deep a grave, I fear, according to

that."



"I am very sorry; but it cannot be helped."



"How can you be sorry for me, when you wilfully keep open the

grave?"



"Oh no--that's not so," returned Grace, quickly, and moved to go

away from him.



"But, dearest Grace," said he, "you have condescended to come; and

I thought from it that perhaps when I had passed through a long

state of probation you would be generous.  But if there can be no

hope of our getting completely reconciled, treat me gently--wretch

though I am."



"I did not say you were a wretch, nor have I ever said so."



"But you have such a contemptuous way of looking at me that I fear

you think so."



Grace's heart struggled between the wish not to be harsh and the

fear that she might mislead him.  "I cannot look contemptuous

unless I feel contempt," she said, evasively.  "And all I feel is

lovelessness."



"I have been very bad, I know," he returned.  "But unless you can

really love me again, Grace, I would rather go away from you

forever.  I don't want you to receive me again for duty's sake, or

anything of that sort.  If I had not cared more for your affection

and forgiveness than my own personal comfort, I should never have

come back here.  I could have obtained a practice at a distance,

and have lived my own life without coldness or reproach.  But I

have chosen to return to the one spot on earth where my name is

tarnished--to enter the house of a man from whom I have had worse

treatment than from any other man alive--all for you!"



This was undeniably true, and it had its weight with Grace, who

began to look as if she thought she had been shockingly severe.



"Before you go," he continued, "I want to know your pleasure about

me--what you wish me to do, or not to do."



"You are independent of me, and it seems a mockery to ask that. 

Far be it from me to advise.  But I will think it over.  I rather

need advice myself than stand in a position to give it."



"YOU don't need advice, wisest, dearest woman that ever lived.  If

you did--"



"Would you give it to me?"



"Would you act upon what I gave?"



"That's not a fair inquiry," said she, smiling despite her

gravity.  "I don't mind hearing it--what you do really think the

most correct and proper course for me."



"It is so easy for me to say, and yet I dare not, for it would be

provoking you to remonstrances."



Knowing, of course, what the advice would be, she did not press

him further, and was about to beckon Marty forward and leave him,

when he interrupted her with, "Oh, one moment, dear Grace--you

will meet me again?"



She eventually agreed to see him that day fortnight.  Fitzpiers

expostulated at the interval, but the half-alarmed earnestness

with which she entreated him not to come sooner made him say

hastily that he submitted to her will--that he would regard her as

a friend only, anxious for his reform and well-being, till such

time as she might allow him to exceed that privilege.



All this was to assure her; it was only too clear that he had not

won her confidence yet.  It amazed Fitzpiers, and overthrew all

his deductions from previous experience, to find that this girl,

though she had been married to him, could yet be so coy. 

Notwithstanding a certain fascination that it carried with it, his

reflections were sombre as he went homeward; he saw how deep had

been his offence to produce so great a wariness in a gentle and

once unsuspicious soul.



He was himself too fastidious to care to coerce her.  To be an

object of misgiving or dislike to a woman who shared his home was

what he could not endure the thought of.  Life as it stood was

more tolerable.



When he was gone, Marty joined Mrs. Fitzpiers.  She would fain

have consulted Marty on the question of Platonic relations with

her former husband, as she preferred to regard him.  But Marty

showed no great interest in their affairs, so Grace said nothing. 

They came onward, and saw Melbury standing at the scene of the

felling which had been audible to them, when, telling Marty that

she wished her meeting with Mr. Fitzpiers to be kept private, she

left the girl to join her father.  At any rate, she would consult

him on the expediency of occasionally seeing her husband.



Her father was cheerful, and walked by her side as he had done in

earlier days.  "I was thinking of you when you came up," he said. 

"I have considered that what has happened is for the best.  Since

your husband is gone away, and seems not to wish to trouble you,

why, let him go, and drop out of your life.  Many women are worse

off.  You can live here comfortably enough, and he can emigrate,

or do what he likes for his good.  I wouldn't mind sending him the

further sum of money he might naturally expect to come to him, so

that you may not be bothered with him any more.  He could hardly

have gone on living here without speaking to me, or meeting me;

and that would have been very unpleasant on both sides."



These remarks checked her intention.  There was a sense of

weakness in following them by saying that she had just met her

husband by appointment.  "Then you would advise me not to

communicate with him?" she observed.



"I shall never advise ye again.  You are your own mistress--do as

you like.  But my opinion is that if you don't live with him, you

had better live without him, and not go shilly-shallying and

playing bopeep.  You sent him away; and now he's gone.  Very well;

trouble him no more."



Grace felt a guiltiness--she hardly knew why--and made no

confession.
