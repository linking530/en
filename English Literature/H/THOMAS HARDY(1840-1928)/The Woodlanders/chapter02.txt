In the room from which this cheerful blaze proceeded, he beheld a

girl seated on a willow chair, and busily occupied by the light of

the fire, which was ample and of wood.  With a bill-hook in one

hand and a leather glove, much too large for her, on the other,

she was making spars, such as are used by thatchers, with great

rapidity.  She wore a leather apron for this purpose, which was

also much too large for her figure.  On her left hand lay a bundle

of the straight, smooth sticks called spar-gads--the raw material

of her manufacture; on her right, a heap of chips and ends--the

refuse--with which the fire was maintained; in front, a pile of

the finished articles.  To produce them she took up each gad,

looked critically at it from end to end, cut it to length, split

it into four, and sharpened each of the quarters with dexterous

blows, which brought it to a triangular point precisely resembling

that of a bayonet.



Beside her, in case she might require more light, a brass

candlestick stood on a little round table, curiously formed of an

old coffin-stool, with a deal top nailed on, the white surface of

the latter contrasting oddly with the black carved oak of the

substructure.  The social position of the household in the past

was almost as definitively shown by the presence of this article

as that of an esquire or nobleman by his old helmets or shields. 

It had been customary for every well-to-do villager, whose tenure

was by copy of court-roll, or in any way more permanent than that

of the mere cotter, to keep a pair of these stools for the use of

his own dead; but for the last generation or two a feeling of cui

bono had led to the discontinuance of the custom, and the stools

were frequently made use of in the manner described.



The young woman laid down the bill-hook for a moment and examined

the palm of her right hand, which, unlike the other, was ungloved,

and showed little hardness or roughness about it.  The palm was

red and blistering, as if this present occupation were not

frequent enough with her to subdue it to what it worked in.  As

with so many right hands born to manual labor, there was nothing

in its fundamental shape to bear out the physiological

conventionalism that gradations of birth, gentle or mean, show

themselves primarily in the form of this member.  Nothing but a

cast of the die of destiny had decided that the girl should handle

the tool; and the fingers which clasped the heavy ash haft might

have skilfully guided the pencil or swept the string, had they

only been set to do it in good time.



Her face had the usual fulness of expression which is developed by

a life of solitude.  Where the eyes of a multitude beat like waves

upon a countenance they seem to wear away its individuality; but

in the still water of privacy every tentacle of feeling and

sentiment shoots out in visible luxuriance, to be interpreted as

readily as a child's look by an intruder.  In years she was no

more than nineteen or twenty, but the necessity of taking thought

at a too early period of life had forced the provisional curves of

her childhood's face to a premature finality.  Thus she had but

little pretension to beauty, save in one prominent particular--her

hair.  Its abundance made it almost unmanageable; its color was,

roughly speaking, and as seen here by firelight, brown, but

careful notice, or an observation by day, would have revealed that

its true shade was a rare and beautiful approximation to chestnut.



On this one bright gift of Time to the particular victim of his

now before us the new-comer's eyes were fixed; meanwhile the

fingers of his right hand mechanically played over something

sticking up from his waistcoat-pocket--the bows of a pair of

scissors, whose polish made them feebly responsive to the light

within.  In her present beholder's mind the scene formed by the

girlish spar-maker composed itself into a post-Raffaelite picture

of extremest quality, wherein the girl's hair alone, as the focus

of observation, was depicted with intensity and distinctness, and

her face, shoulders, hands, and figure in general, being a blurred

mass of unimportant detail lost in haze and obscurity.



He hesitated no longer, but tapped at the door and entered.  The

young woman turned at the crunch of his boots on the sanded floor,

and exclaiming, "Oh, Mr. Percombe, how you frightened me!" quite

lost her color for a moment.



He replied, "You should shut your door--then you'd hear folk open

it."



"I can't," she said; "the chimney smokes so.  Mr. Percombe, you

look as unnatural out of your shop as a canary in a thorn-hedge. 

Surely you have not come out here on my account--for--"



"Yes--to have your answer about this." He touched her head with

his cane, and she winced.  "Do you agree?" he continued.  "It is

necessary that I should know at once, as the lady is soon going

away, and it takes time to make up."



"Don't press me--it worries me.  I was in hopes you had thought no

more of it.  I can NOT part with it--so there!"



"Now, look here, Marty," said the barber, sitting down on the

coffin-stool table.  "How much do you get for making these spars?"



"Hush--father's up-stairs awake, and he don't know that I am doing

his work."



"Well, now tell me," said the man, more softly.  "How much do you

get?"



"Eighteenpence a thousand," she said, reluctantly.



"Who are you making them for?"



"Mr. Melbury, the timber-dealer, just below here."



"And how many can you make in a day?"



"In a day and half the night, three bundles--that's a thousand and

a half."



"Two and threepence." The barber paused.  "Well, look here," he

continued, with the remains of a calculation in his tone, which

calculation had been the reduction to figures of the probable

monetary magnetism necessary to overpower the resistant force of

her present purse and the woman's love of comeliness, "here's a

sovereign--a gold sovereign, almost new." He held it out between

his finger and thumb.  "That's as much as you'd earn in a week and

a half at that rough man's work, and it's yours for just letting

me snip off what you've got too much of."



The girl's bosom moved a very little.  "Why can't the lady send to

some other girl who don't value her hair--not to me?" she

exclaimed.



"Why, simpleton, because yours is the exact shade of her own, and

'tis a shade you can't match by dyeing.  But you are not going to

refuse me now I've come all the way from Sherton o' purpose?"



"I say I won't sell it--to you or anybody."



"Now listen," and he drew up a little closer beside her.  "The

lady is very rich, and won't be particular to a few shillings; so

I will advance to this on my own responsibility--I'll make the one

sovereign two, rather than go back empty-handed."



"No, no, no!" she cried, beginning to be much agitated.  "You are

a-tempting me, Mr. Percombe.  You go on like the Devil to Dr.

Faustus in the penny book.  But I don't want your money, and won't

agree.  Why did you come? I said when you got me into your shop

and urged me so much, that I didn't mean to sell my hair!" The

speaker was hot and stern.



"Marty, now hearken.  The lady that wants it wants it badly.  And,

between you and me, you'd better let her have it.  'Twill be bad

for you if you don't."



"Bad for me? Who is she, then?"



The barber held his tongue, and the girl repeated the question.



"I am not at liberty to tell you.  And as she is going abroad soon

it makes no difference who she is at all."



"She wants it to go abroad wi'?"



Percombe assented by a nod.  The girl regarded him reflectively. 

"Barber Percombe," she said, "I know who 'tis.  'Tis she at the

House--Mrs. Charmond!"



"That's my secret.  However, if you agree to let me have it, I'll

tell you in confidence."



"I'll certainly not let you have it unless you tell me the truth. 

It is Mrs. Charmond."



The barber dropped his voice.  "Well--it is.  You sat in front of

her in church the other day, and she noticed how exactly your hair

matched her own.  Ever since then she's been hankering for it, and

at last decided to get it.  As she won't wear it till she goes off

abroad, she knows nobody will recognize the change.  I'm

commissioned to get it for her, and then it is to be made up.  I

shouldn't have vamped all these miles for any less important

employer.  Now, mind--'tis as much as my business with her is

worth if it should be known that I've let out her name; but honor

between us two, Marty, and you'll say nothing that would injure

me?"



"I don't wish to tell upon her," said Marty, coolly.  "But my hair

is my own, and I'm going to keep it."



"Now, that's not fair, after what I've told you," said the nettled

barber.  "You see, Marty, as you are in the same parish, and in

one of her cottages, and your father is ill, and wouldn't like to

turn out, it would be as well to oblige her.  I say that as a

friend.  But I won't press you to make up your mind to-night. 

You'll be coming to market to-morrow, I dare say, and you can call

then.  If you think it over you'll be inclined to bring what I

want, I know."



"I've nothing more to say," she answered.



Her companion saw from her manner that it was useless to urge her

further by speech.  "As you are a trusty young woman," he said,

"I'll put these sovereigns up here for ornament, that you may see

how handsome they are.  Bring the hair to-morrow, or return the

sovereigns." He stuck them edgewise into the frame of a small

mantle looking-glass.  "I hope you'll bring it, for your sake and

mine.  I should have thought she could have suited herself

elsewhere; but as it's her fancy it must be indulged if possible. 

If you cut it off yourself, mind how you do it so as to keep all

the locks one way." He showed her how this was to be done.



"But I sha'nt," she replied, with laconic indifference.  "I value

my looks too much to spoil 'em.  She wants my hair to get another

lover with; though if stories are true she's broke the heart of

many a noble gentleman already."



"Lord, it's wonderful how you guess things, Marty," said the

barber.  "I've had it from them that know that there certainly is

some foreign gentleman in her eye.  However, mind what I ask."



"She's not going to get him through me."



Percombe had retired as far as the door; he came back, planted his

cane on the coffin-stool, and looked her in the face.  "Marty

South," he said, with deliberate emphasis, "YOU'VE GOT A LOVER

YOURSELF, and that's why you won't let it go!"



She reddened so intensely as to pass the mild blush that suffices

to heighten beauty; she put the yellow leather glove on one hand,

took up the hook with the other, and sat down doggedly to her work

without turning her face to him again.  He regarded her head for a

moment, went to the door, and with one look back at her, departed

on his way homeward.



Marty pursued her occupation for a few minutes, then suddenly

laying down the bill-hook, she jumped up and went to the back of

the room, where she opened a door which disclosed a staircase so

whitely scrubbed that the grain of the wood was wellnigh sodden

away by such cleansing.  At the top she gently approached a

bedroom, and without entering, said, "Father, do you want

anything?"



A weak voice inside answered in the negative; adding, "I should be

all right by to-morrow if it were not for the tree!"



"The tree again--always the tree! Oh, father, don't worry so about

that.  You know it can do you no harm."



"Who have ye had talking to ye down-stairs?"



"A Sherton man called--nothing to trouble about," she said,

soothingly.  "Father," she went on, "can Mrs. Charmond turn us out

of our house if she's minded to?"



"Turn us out? No.  Nobody can turn us out till my poor soul is

turned out of my body.  'Tis life-hold, like Ambrose

Winterborne's.  But when my life drops 'twill be hers--not till

then." His words on this subject so far had been rational and firm

enough.  But now he lapsed into his moaning strain: "And the tree

will do it--that tree will soon be the death of me."



"Nonsense, you know better.  How can it be?" She refrained from

further speech, and descended to the ground-floor again.



"Thank Heaven, then," she said to herself, "what belongs to me I

keep."
