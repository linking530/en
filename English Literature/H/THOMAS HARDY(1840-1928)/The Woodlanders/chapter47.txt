Were the inventors of automatic machines to be ranged according to

the excellence of their devices for producing sound artistic

torture, the creator of the man-trap would occupy a very

respectable if not a very high place.



It should rather, however, be said, the inventor of the particular

form of man-trap of which this found in the keeper's out-house was

a specimen.  For there were other shapes and other sizes,

instruments which, if placed in a row beside one of the type

disinterred by Tim, would have worn the subordinate aspect of the

bears, wild boars, or wolves in a travelling menagerie, as

compared with the leading lion or tiger.  In short, though many

varieties had been in use during those centuries which we are

accustomed to look back upon as the true and only period of merry

England--in the rural districts more especially--and onward down

to the third decade of the nineteenth century, this model had

borne the palm, and had been most usually followed when the

orchards and estates required new ones.



There had been the toothless variety used by the softer-hearted

landlords--quite contemptible in their clemency.  The jaws of

these resembled the jaws of an old woman to whom time has left

nothing but gums.  There were also the intermediate or half-

toothed sorts, probably devised by the middle-natured squires, or

those under the influence of their wives: two inches of mercy, two

inches of cruelty, two inches of mere nip, two inches of probe,

and so on, through the whole extent of the jaws.  There were also,

as a class apart, the bruisers, which did not lacerate the flesh,

but only crushed the bone



The sight of one of these gins when set produced a vivid

impression that it was endowed with life.  It exhibited the

combined aspects of a shark, a crocodile, and a scorpion.  Each

tooth was in the form of a tapering spine, two and a quarter

inches long, which, when the jaws were closed, stood in

alternation from this side and from that.  When they were open,

the two halves formed a complete circle between two and three feet

in diameter, the plate or treading-place in the midst being about

a foot square, while from beneath extended in opposite directions

the soul of the apparatus, the pair of springs, each one being of

a stiffness to render necessary a lever or the whole weight of the

body when forcing it down.



There were men at this time still living at Hintock who remembered

when the gin and others like it were in use.  Tim Tangs's great-

uncle had endured a night of six hours in this very trap, which

lamed him for life.  Once a keeper of Hintock woods set it on the

track of a poacher, and afterwards, coming back that way,

forgetful of what he had done, walked into it himself.  The wound

brought on lockjaw, of which he died.  This event occurred during

the thirties, and by the year 1840 the use of such implements was

well-nigh discontinued in the neighborhood.  But being made

entirely of iron, they by no means disappeared, and in almost

every village one could be found in some nook or corner as readily

as this was found by Tim.  It had, indeed, been a fearful

amusement of Tim and other Hintock lads--especially those who had

a dim sense of becoming renowned poachers when they reached their

prime--to drag out this trap from its hiding, set it, and throw it

with billets of wood, which were penetrated by the teeth to the

depth of near an inch.



As soon as he had examined the trap, and found that the hinges and

springs were still perfect, he shouldered it without more ado, and

returned with his burden to his own garden, passing on through the

hedge to the path immediately outside the boundary.  Here, by the

help of a stout stake, he set the trap, and laid it carefully

behind a bush while he went forward to reconnoitre.  As has been

stated, nobody passed this way for days together sometimes; but

there was just a possibility that some other pedestrian than the

one in request might arrive, and it behooved Tim to be careful as

to the identity of his victim.



Going about a hundred yards along the rising ground to the right,

he reached a ridge whereon a large and thick holly grew.  Beyond

this for some distance the wood was more open, and the course

which Fitzpiers must pursue to reach the point, if he came to-

night, was visible a long way forward.



For some time there was no sign of him or of anybody.  Then there

shaped itself a spot out of the dim mid-distance, between the

masses of brushwood on either hand.  And it enlarged, and Tim

could hear the brushing of feet over the tufts of sour-grass.  The

airy gait revealed Fitzpiers even before his exact outline could

be seen.



Tim Tangs turned about, and ran down the opposite side of the

hill, till he was again at the head of his own garden.  It was the

work of a few moments to drag out the man-trap, very gently--that

the plate might not be disturbed sufficiently to throw it--to a

space between a pair of young oaks which, rooted in contiguity,

grew apart upward, forming a V-shaped opening between; and, being

backed up by bushes, left this as the only course for a foot-

passenger.  In it he laid the trap with the same gentleness of

handling, locked the chain round one of the trees, and finally

slid back the guard which was placed to keep the gin from

accidentally catching the arms of him who set it, or, to use the

local and better word, "toiled" it.



Having completed these arrangements, Tim sprang through the

adjoining hedge of his father's garden, ran down the path, and

softly entered the house.



Obedient to his order, Suke had gone to bed; and as soon as he had

bolted the door, Tim unlaced and kicked off his boots at the foot

of the stairs, and retired likewise, without lighting a candle. 

His object seemed to be to undress as soon as possible.  Before,

however, he had completed the operation, a long cry resounded

without--penetrating, but indescribable.



"What's that?" said Suke, starting up in bed.



"Sounds as if somebody had caught a hare in his gin."



"Oh no," said she.  "It was not a hare, 'twas louder.  Hark!"



"Do 'ee get to sleep," said Tim.  "How be you going to wake at

half-past three else?"



She lay down and was silent.  Tim stealthily opened the window and

listened.  Above the low harmonies produced by the instrumentation

of the various species of trees around the premises he could hear

the twitching of a chain from the spot whereon he had set the man-

trap.  But further human sound there was none.



Tim was puzzled.  In the haste of his project he had not

calculated upon a cry; but if one, why not more? He soon ceased to

essay an answer, for Hintock was dead to him already.  In half a

dozen hours he would be out of its precincts for life, on his way

to the antipodes.  He closed the window and lay down.







The hour which had brought these movements of Tim to birth had

been operating actively elsewhere.  Awaiting in her father's house

the minute of her appointment with her husband, Grace Fitzpiers

deliberated on many things.  Should she inform her father before

going out that the estrangement of herself and Edgar was not so

complete as he had imagined, and deemed desirable for her

happiness? If she did so she must in some measure become the

apologist of her husband, and she was not prepared to go so far.



As for him, he kept her in a mood of considerate gravity.  He

certainly had changed.  He had at his worst times always been

gentle in his manner towards her.  Could it be that she might make

of him a true and worthy husband yet?  She had married him; there

was no getting over that; and ought she any longer to keep him at

a distance?  His suave deference to her lightest whim on the

question of his comings and goings, when as her lawful husband he

might show a little independence, was a trait in his character as

unexpected as it was engaging.  If she had been his empress, and

he her thrall, he could not have exhibited a more sensitive care

to avoid intruding upon her against her will.



Impelled by a remembrance she took down a prayer-book and turned

to the marriage-service.  Reading it slowly through, she became

quite appalled at her recent off-handedness, when she rediscovered

what awfully solemn promises she had made him at those chancel

steps not so very long ago.



She became lost in long ponderings on how far a person's

conscience might be bound by vows made without at the time a full

recognition of their force.  That particular sentence, beginning

"Whom God hath joined together," was a staggerer for a gentlewoman

of strong devotional sentiment.  She wondered whether God really

did join them together.  Before she had done deliberating the time

of her engagement drew near, and she went out of the house almost

at the moment that Tim Tangs retired to his own.



The position of things at that critical juncture was briefly as

follows.



Two hundred yards to the right of the upper end of Tangs's garden

Fitzpiers was still advancing, having now nearly reached the

summit of the wood-clothed ridge, the path being the actual one

which further on passed between the two young oaks.  Thus far it

was according to Tim's conjecture.  But about two hundred yards to

the left, or rather less, was arising a condition which he had not

divined, the emergence of Grace as aforesaid from the upper corner

of her father's garden, with the view of meeting Tim's intended

victim.  Midway between husband and wife was the diabolical trap,

silent, open, ready.



Fitzpiers's walk that night had been cheerful, for he was

convinced that the slow and gentle method he had adopted was

promising success.  The very restraint that he was obliged to

exercise upon himself, so as not to kill the delicate bud of

returning confidence, fed his flame.  He walked so much more

rapidly than Grace that, if they continued advancing as they had

begun, he would reach the trap a good half-minute before she could

reach the same spot.



But here a new circumstance came in; to escape the unpleasantness

of being watched or listened to by lurkers--naturally curious by

reason of their strained relations--they had arranged that their

meeting for to-night should be at the holm-tree on the ridge above

named.  So soon, accordingly, as Fitzpiers reached the tree he

stood still to await her.



He had not paused under the prickly foliage more than two minutes

when he thought he heard a scream from the other side of the

ridge.  Fitzpiers wondered what it could mean; but such wind as

there was just now blew in an adverse direction, and his mood was

light.  He set down the origin of the sound to one of the

superstitious freaks or frolicsome scrimmages between sweethearts

that still survived in Hintock from old-English times; and waited

on where he stood till ten minutes had passed.  Feeling then a

little uneasy, his mind reverted to the scream; and he went

forward over the summit and down the embowered incline, till he

reached the pair of sister oaks with the narrow opening between

them.



Fitzpiers stumbled and all but fell.  Stretching down his hand to

ascertain the obstruction, it came in contact with a confused mass

of silken drapery and iron-work that conveyed absolutely no

explanatory idea to his mind at all.  It was but the work of a

moment to strike a match; and then he saw a sight which congealed

his blood.



The man-trap was thrown; and between its jaws was part of a

woman's clothing--a patterned silk skirt--gripped with such

violence that the iron teeth had passed through it, skewering its

tissue in a score of places.  He immediately recognized the skirt

as that of one of his wife's gowns--the gown that she had worn

when she met him on the very last occasion.



Fitzpiers had often studied the effect of these instruments when

examining the collection at Hintock House, and the conception

instantly flashed through him that Grace had been caught, taken

out mangled by some chance passer, and carried home, some of her

clothes being left behind in the difficulty of getting her free. 

The shock of this conviction, striking into the very current of

high hope, was so great that he cried out like one in corporal

agony, and in his misery bowed himself down to the ground.



Of all the degrees and qualities of punishment that Fitzpiers had

undergone since his sins against Grace first began, not any even

approximated in intensity to this.



"Oh, my own--my darling! Oh, cruel Heaven--it is too much, this!"

he cried, writhing and rocking himself over the sorry accessaries

of her he deplored.



The voice of his distress was sufficiently loud to be audible to

any one who might have been there to hear it; and one there was. 

Right and left of the narrow pass between the oaks were dense

bushes; and now from behind these a female figure glided, whose

appearance even in the gloom was, though graceful in outline,

noticeably strange.



She was in white up to the waist, and figured above.  She was, in

short, Grace, his wife, lacking the portion of her dress which the

gin retained.



"Don't be grieved about me--don't, dear Edgar!" she exclaimed,

rushing up and bending over him.  "I am not hurt a bit! I was

coming on to find you after I had released myself, but I heard

footsteps; and I hid away, because I was without some of my

clothing, and I did not know who the person might be."



Fitzpiers had sprung to his feet, and his next act was no less

unpremeditated by him than it was irresistible by her, and would

have been so by any woman not of Amazonian strength.  He clasped

his arms completely round, pressed her to his breast, and kissed

her passionately.



"You are not dead!--you are not hurt! Thank God--thank God!" he

said, almost sobbing in his delight and relief from the horror of

his apprehension.  "Grace, my wife, my love, how is this--what has

happened?"



"I was coming on to you," she said as distinctly as she could in

the half-smothered state of her face against his.  "I was trying

to be as punctual as possible, and as I had started a minute late

I ran along the path very swiftly--fortunately for myself.  Just

when I had passed between these trees I felt something clutch at

my dress from behind with a noise, and the next moment I was

pulled backward by it, and fell to the ground.  I screamed with

terror, thinking it was a man lying down there to murder me, but

the next moment I discovered it was iron, and that my clothes were

caught in a trap.  I pulled this way and that, but the thing would

not let go, drag it as I would, and I did not know what to do.  I

did not want to alarm my father or anybody, as I wished nobody to

know of these meetings with you; so I could think of no other plan

than slipping off my skirt, meaning to run on and tell you what a

strange accident had happened to me.  But when I had just freed

myself by leaving the dress behind, I heard steps, and not being

sure it was you, I did not like to be seen in such a pickle, so I

hid away."



"It was only your speed that saved you! One or both of your legs

would have been broken if you had come at ordinary walking pace."



"Or yours, if you had got here first," said she, beginning to

realize the whole ghastliness of the possibility.  "Oh, Edgar,

there has been an Eye watching over us to-night, and we should be

thankful indeed!"



He continued to press his face to hers.  "You are mine--mine again

now."



She gently owned that she supposed she was.  "I heard what you

said when you thought I was injured," she went on, shyly, "and I

know that a man who could suffer as you were suffering must have a

tender regard for me.  But how does this awful thing come here?"



"I suppose it has something to do with poachers." Fitzpiers was

still so shaken by the sense of her danger that he was obliged to

sit awhile, and it was not until Grace said, "If I could only get

my skirt out nobody would know anything about it," that he

bestirred himself.



By their united efforts, each standing on one of the springs of

the trap, they pressed them down sufficiently to insert across the

jaws a billet which they dragged from a faggot near at hand; and

it was then possible to extract the silk mouthful from the

monster's bite, creased and pierced with many holes, but not torn. 

Fitzpiers assisted her to put it on again; and when her customary

contours were thus restored they walked on together, Grace taking

his arm, till he effected an improvement by clasping it round her

waist.



The ice having been broken in this unexpected manner, she made no

further attempt at reserve.  "I would ask you to come into the

house," she said, "but my meetings with you have been kept secret

from my father, and I should like to prepare him."



"Never mind, dearest.  I could not very well have accepted the

invitation.  I shall never live here again--as much for your sake

as for mine.  I have news to tell you on this very point, but my

alarm had put it out of my head.  I have bought a practice, or

rather a partnership, in the Midlands, and I must go there in a

week to take up permanent residence.  My poor old great-aunt died

about eight months ago, and left me enough to do this.  I have

taken a little furnished house for a time, till we can get one of

our own."



He described the place, and the surroundings, and the view from

the windows, and Grace became much interested.  "But why are you

not there now?" she said.



"Because I cannot tear myself away from here till I have your

promise.  Now, darling, you will accompany me there--will you not?

To-night has settled that."



Grace's tremblings had gone off, and she did not say nay.  They

went on together.



The adventure, and the emotions consequent upon the reunion which

that event had forced on, combined to render Grace oblivious of

the direction of their desultory ramble, till she noticed they

were in an encircled glade in the densest part of the wood,

whereon the moon, that had imperceptibly added its rays to the

scene, shone almost vertically.  It was an exceptionally soft,

balmy evening for the time of year, which was just that transient

period in the May month when beech-trees have suddenly unfolded

large limp young leaves of the softness of butterflies' wings. 

Boughs bearing such leaves hung low around, and completely

enclosed them, so that it was as if they were in a great green

vase, which had moss for its bottom and leaf sides.



The clouds having been packed in the west that evening so as to

retain the departing glare a long while, the hour had seemed much

earlier than it was.  But suddenly the question of time occurred

to her.



"I must go back," she said; and without further delay they set

their faces towards Hintock.  As they walked he examined his watch

by the aid of the now strong moonlight.



"By the gods, I think I have lost my train!" said Fitzpiers.



"Dear me--whereabouts are we?" said she.



"Two miles in the direction of Sherton."



"Then do you hasten on, Edgar.  I am not in the least afraid.  I

recognize now the part of the wood we are in and I can find my way

back quite easily.  I'll tell my father that we have made it up. 

I wish I had not kept our meetings so private, for it may vex him

a little to know I have been seeing you.  He is getting old and

irritable, that was why I did not.  Good-by."



"But, as I must stay at the Earl of Wessex to-night, for I cannot

possibly catch the train, I think it would be safer for you to let

me take care of you."



"But what will my father think has become of me? He does not know

in the least where I am--he thinks I only went into the garden for

a few minutes."



"He will surely guess--somebody has seen me for certain.  I'll go

all the way back with you to-morrow."



"But that newly done-up place--the Earl of Wessex!"



"If you are so very particular about the publicity I will stay at

the Three Tuns."



"Oh no--it is not that I am particular--but I haven't a brush or

comb or anything!"
