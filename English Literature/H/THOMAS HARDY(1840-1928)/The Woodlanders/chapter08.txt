The inspiriting appointment which had led Grace Melbury to indulge

in a six-candle illumination for the arrangement of her attire,

carried her over the ground the next morning with a springy tread. 

Her sense of being properly appreciated on her own native soil

seemed to brighten the atmosphere and herbage around her, as the

glowworm's lamp irradiates the grass.  Thus she moved along, a

vessel of emotion going to empty itself on she knew not what.



Twenty minutes' walking through copses, over a stile, and along an

upland lawn brought her to the verge of a deep glen, at the bottom

of which Hintock House appeared immediately beneath her eye.  To

describe it as standing in a hollow would not express the

situation of the manor-house; it stood in a hole, notwithstanding

that the hole was full of beauty.  From the spot which Grace had

reached a stone could easily have been thrown over or into, the

birds'-nested chimneys of the mansion.  Its walls were surmounted

by a battlemented parapet; but the gray lead roofs were quite

visible behind it, with their gutters, laps, rolls, and skylights,

together with incised letterings and shoe-patterns cut by idlers

thereon.



The front of the house exhibited an ordinary manorial presentation

of Elizabethan windows, mullioned and hooded, worked in rich

snuff-colored freestone from local quarries.  The ashlar of the

walls, where not overgrown with ivy and other creepers, was coated

with lichen of every shade, intensifying its luxuriance with its

nearness to the ground, till, below the plinth, it merged in moss.



Above the house to the back was a dense plantation, the roots of

whose trees were above the level of the chimneys.  The

corresponding high ground on which Grace stood was richly grassed,

with only an old tree here and there.  A few sheep lay about,

which, as they ruminated, looked quietly into the bedroom windows. 

The situation of the house, prejudicial to humanity, was a

stimulus to vegetation, on which account an endless shearing of

the heavy-armed ivy was necessary, and a continual lopping of

trees and shrubs.  It was an edifice built in times when human

constitutions were damp-proof, when shelter from the boisterous

was all that men thought of in choosing a dwelling-place, the

insidious being beneath their notice; and its hollow site was an

ocular reminder, by its unfitness for modern lives, of the

fragility to which these have declined.  The highest architectural

cunning could have done nothing to make Hintock House dry and

salubrious; and ruthless ignorance could have done little to make

it unpicturesque.  It was vegetable nature's own home; a spot to

inspire the painter and poet of still life--if they did not suffer

too much from the relaxing atmosphere--and to draw groans from the

gregariously disposed.  Grace descended the green escarpment by a

zigzag path into the drive, which swept round beneath the slope. 

The exterior of the house had been familiar to her from her

childhood, but she had never been inside, and the approach to

knowing an old thing in a new way was a lively experience.  It was

with a little flutter that she was shown in; but she recollected

that Mrs. Charmond would probably be alone.  Up to a few days

before this time that lady had been accompanied in her comings,

stayings, and goings by a relative believed to be her aunt;

latterly, however, these two ladies had separated, owing, it was

supposed, to a quarrel, and Mrs. Charmond had been left desolate. 

Being presumably a woman who did not care for solitude, this

deprivation might possibly account for her sudden interest in

Grace.



Mrs. Charmond was at the end of a gallery opening from the hall

when Miss Melbury was announced, and saw her through the glass

doors between them.  She came forward with a smile on her face,

and told the young girl it was good of her to come.



"Ah! you have noticed those," she said, seeing that Grace's eyes

were attracted by some curious objects against the walls.  "They

are man-traps.  My husband was a connoisseur in man-traps and

spring-guns and such articles, collecting them from all his

neighbors.  He knew the histories of all these--which gin had

broken a man's leg, which gun had killed a man.  That one, I

remember his saying, had been set by a game-keeper in the track of

a notorious poacher; but the keeper, forgetting what he had done,

went that way himself, received the charge in the lower part of

his body, and died of the wound.  I don't like them here, but I've

never yet given directions for them to be taken away." She added,

playfully, "Man-traps are of rather ominous significance where a

person of our sex lives, are they not?"



Grace was bound to smile; but that side of womanliness was one

which her inexperience had no great zest in contemplating.



"They are interesting, no doubt, as relics of a barbarous time

happily past," she said, looking thoughtfully at the varied

designs of these instruments of torture--some with semi-circular

jaws, some with rectangular; most of them with long, sharp teeth,

but a few with none, so that their jaws looked like the blank gums

of old age.



"Well, we must not take them too seriously," said Mrs. Charmond,

with an indolent turn of her head, and they moved on inward.  When

she had shown her visitor different articles in cabinets that she

deemed likely to interest her, some tapestries, wood-carvings,

ivories, miniatures, and so on--always with a mien of listlessness

which might either have been constitutional, or partly owing to

the situation of the place--they sat down to an early cup of tea.



"Will you pour it out, please? Do," she said, leaning back in her

chair, and placing her hand above her forehead, while her almond

eyes--those long eyes so common to the angelic legions of early

Italian art--became longer, and her voice more languishing.  She

showed that oblique-mannered softness which is perhaps most

frequent in women of darker complexion and more lymphatic

temperament than Mrs. Charmond's was; who lingeringly smile their

meanings to men rather than speak them, who inveigle rather than

prompt, and take advantage of currents rather than steer.



"I am the most inactive woman when I am here," she said.  "I think

sometimes I was born to live and do nothing, nothing, nothing but

float about, as we fancy we do sometimes in dreams.  But that

cannot be really my destiny, and I must struggle against such

fancies."



"I am so sorry you do not enjoy exertion--it is quite sad! I wish

I could tend you and make you very happy."



There was something so sympathetic, so appreciative, in the sound

of Grace's voice, that it impelled people to play havoc with their

customary reservations in talking to her.  "It is tender and kind

of you to feel that," said Mrs. Charmond.  "Perhaps I have given

you the notion that my languor is more than it really is.  But

this place oppresses me, and I have a plan of going abroad a good

deal.  I used to go with a relative, but that arrangement has

dropped through." Regarding Grace with a final glance of

criticism, she seemed to make up her mind to consider the young

girl satisfactory, and continued: "Now I am often impelled to

record my impressions of times and places.  I have often thought

of writing a 'New Sentimental Journey.'  But I cannot find energy

enough to do it alone.  When I am at different places in the south

of Europe I feel a crowd of ideas and fancies thronging upon me

continually, but to unfold writing-materials, take up a cold steel

pen, and put these impressions down systematically on cold, smooth

paper--that I cannot do.  So I have thought that if I always could

have somebody at my elbow with whom I am in sympathy, I might

dictate any ideas that come into my head.  And directly I had made

your acquaintance the other day it struck me that you would suit

me so well.  Would you like to undertake it?  You might read to

me, too, if desirable.  Will you think it over, and ask your

parents if they are willing?"



"Oh yes," said Grace.  "I am almost sure they would be very glad."



"You are so accomplished, I hear; I should be quite honored by

such intellectual company."



Grace, modestly blushing, deprecated any such idea.



"Do you keep up your lucubrations at Little Hintock?"



"Oh no.  Lucubrations are not unknown at Little Hintock; but they

are not carried on by me."



"What--another student in that retreat?"



"There is a surgeon lately come, and I have heard that he reads a

great deal--I see his light sometimes through the trees late at

night."



"Oh yes--a doctor--I believe I was told of him.  It is a strange

place for him to settle in."



"It is a convenient centre for a practice, they say.  But he does

not confine his studies to medicine, it seems.  He investigates

theology and metaphysics and all sorts of subjects."



"What is his name?"



"Fitzpiers.  He represents a very old family, I believe, the

Fitzpierses of Buckbury-Fitzpiers--not a great many miles from

here."



"I am not sufficiently local to know the history of the family.  I

was never in the county till my husband brought me here." Mrs.

Charmond did not care to pursue this line of investigation. 

Whatever mysterious merit might attach to family antiquity, it was

one which, though she herself could claim it, her adaptable,

wandering weltburgerliche nature had grown tired of caring about--

a peculiarity that made her a contrast to her neighbors.  "It is

of rather more importance to know what the man is himself than

what his family is," she said, "if he is going to practise upon us

as a surgeon.  Have you seen him?"



Grace had not.  "I think he is not a very old man," she added.



"Has he a wife?"



"I am not aware that he has."



"Well, I hope he will be useful here.  I must get to know him when

I come back.  It will be very convenient to have a medical man--if

he is clever--in one's own parish.  I get dreadfully nervous

sometimes, living in such an outlandish place; and Sherton is so

far to send to.  No doubt you feel Hintock to be a great change

after watering-place life."



"I do.  But it is home.  It has its advantages and its

disadvantages." Grace was thinking less of the solitude than of

the attendant circumstances.



They chatted on for some time, Grace being set quite at her ease

by her entertainer.  Mrs. Charmond was far too well-practised a

woman not to know that to show a marked patronage to a sensitive

young girl who would probably be very quick to discern it, was to

demolish her dignity rather than to establish it in that young

girl's eyes.  So, being violently possessed with her idea of

making use of this gentle acquaintance, ready and waiting at her

own door, she took great pains to win her confidence at starting.



Just before Grace's departure the two chanced to pause before a

mirror which reflected their faces in immediate juxtaposition, so

as to bring into prominence their resemblances and their

contrasts.  Both looked attractive as glassed back by the faithful

reflector; but Grace's countenance had the effect of making Mrs.

Charmond appear more than her full age.  There are complexions

which set off each other to great advantage, and there are those

which antagonize, the one killing or damaging its neighbor

unmercifully.  This was unhappily the case here.  Mrs. Charmond

fell into a meditation, and replied abstractedly to a cursory

remark of her companion's.  However, she parted from her young

friend in the kindliest tones, promising to send and let her know

as soon as her mind was made up on the arrangement she had

suggested.



When Grace had ascended nearly to the top of the adjoining slope

she looked back, and saw that Mrs. Charmond still stood at the

door, meditatively regarding her.







Often during the previous night, after his call on the Melburys,

Winterborne's thoughts ran upon Grace's announced visit to Hintock

House.  Why could he not have proposed to walk with her part of

the way? Something told him that she might not, on such an

occasion, care for his company.



He was still more of that opinion when, standing in his garden

next day, he saw her go past on the journey with such a pretty

pride in the event.  He wondered if her father's ambition, which

had purchased for her the means of intellectual light and culture

far beyond those of any other native of the village, would conduce

to the flight of her future interests above and away from the

local life which was once to her the movement of the world.



Nevertheless, he had her father's permission to win her if he

could; and to this end it became desirable to bring matters soon

to a crisis, if he ever hoped to do so.  If she should think

herself too good for him, he could let her go and make the best of

his loss; but until he had really tested her he could not say that

she despised his suit.  The question was how to quicken events

towards an issue.



He thought and thought, and at last decided that as good a way as

any would be to give a Christmas party, and ask Grace and her

parents to come as chief guests.



These ruminations were occupying him when there became audible a

slight knocking at his front door.  He descended the path and

looked out, and beheld Marty South, dressed for out-door work.



"Why didn't you come, Mr. Winterborne?" she said.  "I've been

waiting there hours and hours, and at last I thought I must try to

find you."



"Bless my soul, I'd quite forgot," said Giles.



What he had forgotten was that there was a thousand young fir-

trees to be planted in a neighboring spot which had been cleared

by the wood-cutters, and that he had arranged to plant them with

his own hands.  He had a marvellous power of making trees grow. 

Although he would seem to shovel in the earth quite carelessly,

there was a sort of sympathy between himself and the fir, oak, or

beech that he was operating on, so that the roots took hold of the

soil in a few days.  When, on the other hand, any of the

journeymen planted, although they seemed to go through an

identically similar process, one quarter of the trees would die

away during the ensuing August.



Hence Winterborne found delight in the work even when, as at 

present, he contracted to do it on portions of the woodland in

which he had no personal interest.  Marty, who turned her hand to

anything, was usually the one who performed the part of keeping

the trees in a perpendicular position while he threw in the mould.



He accompanied her towards the spot, being stimulated yet further

to proceed with the work by the knowledge that the ground was

close to the way-side along which Grace must pass on her return

from Hintock House.



"You've a cold in the head, Marty," he said, as they walked. 

"That comes of cutting off your hair."



"I suppose it do.  Yes; I've three headaches going on in my head

at the same time."



"Three headaches!"



"Yes, a rheumatic headache in my poll, a sick headache over my

eyes, and a misery headache in the middle of my brain.  However, I

came out, for I thought you might be waiting and grumbling like

anything if I was not there."



The holes were already dug, and they set to work.  Winterborne's

fingers were endowed with a gentle conjuror's touch in spreading

the roots of each little tree, resulting in a sort of caress,

under which the delicate fibres all laid themselves out in their

proper directions for growth.  He put most of these roots towards

the south-west; for, he said, in forty years' time, when some

great gale is blowing from that quarter, the trees will require

the strongest holdfast on that side to stand against it and not

fall.



"How they sigh directly we put 'em upright, though while they are

lying down they don't sigh at all," said Marty.



"Do they?" said Giles.  "I've never noticed it."



She erected one of the young pines into its hole, and held up her

finger; the soft musical breathing instantly set in, which was not

to cease night or day till the grown tree should be felled--

probably long after the two planters should be felled themselves.



"It seems to me," the girl continued, "as if they sigh because

they are very sorry to begin life in earnest--just as we be."



"Just as we be?" He looked critically at her.  "You ought not to

feel like that, Marty."



Her only reply was turning to take up the next tree; and they

planted on through a great part of the day, almost without another

word.  Winterborne's mind ran on his contemplated evening-party,

his abstraction being such that he hardly was conscious of Marty's

presence beside him.  From the nature of their employment, in

which he handled the spade and she merely held the tree, it

followed that he got good exercise and she got none.  But she was

an heroic girl, and though her out-stretched hand was chill as a

stone, and her cheeks blue, and her cold worse than ever, she

would not complain while he was disposed to continue work.  But

when he paused she said, "Mr. Winterborne, can I run down the lane

and back to warm my feet?"



"Why, yes, of course," he said, awakening anew to her existence. 

"Though I was just thinking what a mild day it is for the season. 

Now I warrant that cold of yours is twice as bad as it was.  You

had no business to chop that hair off, Marty; it serves you almost

right.  Look here, cut off home at once."



"A run down the lane will be quite enough."



"No, it won't.  You ought not to have come out to-day at all."



"But I should like to finish the--"



"Marty, I tell you to go home," said he, peremptorily.  "I can

manage to keep the rest of them upright with a stick or

something."



She went away without saying any more.  When she had gone down the

orchard a little distance she looked back.  Giles suddenly went

after her.



"Marty, it was for your good that I was rough, you know.  But warm

yourself in your own way, I don't care."



When she had run off he fancied he discerned a woman's dress

through the holly-bushes which divided the coppice from the road. 

It was Grace at last, on her way back from the interview with Mrs.

Charmond.  He threw down the tree he was planting, and was about

to break through the belt of holly when he suddenly became aware

of the presence of another man, who was looking over the hedge on

the opposite side of the way upon the figure of the unconscious

Grace.  He appeared as a handsome and gentlemanly personage of six

or eight and twenty, and was quizzing her through an eye-glass. 

Seeing that Winterborne was noticing him, he let his glass drop

with a click upon the rail which protected the hedge, and walked

away in the opposite direction.  Giles knew in a moment that this

must be Mr. Fitzpiers.  When he was gone, Winterborne pushed

through the hollies, and emerged close beside the interesting

object of their contemplation.
