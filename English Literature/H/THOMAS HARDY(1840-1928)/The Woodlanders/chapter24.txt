He left her at the door of her father's house.  As he receded, and

was clasped out of sight by the filmy shades, he impressed Grace

as a man who hardly appertained to her existence at all. 

Cleverer, greater than herself, one outside her mental orbit, as

she considered him, he seemed to be her ruler rather than her

equal, protector, and dear familiar friend.



The disappointment she had experienced at his wish, the shock

given to her girlish sensibilities by his irreverent views of

marriage, together with the sure and near approach of the day

fixed for committing her future to his keeping, made her so

restless that she could scarcely sleep at all that night.  She

rose when the sparrows began to walk out of the roof-holes, sat on

the floor of her room in the dim light, and by-and-by peeped out

behind the window-curtains.  It was even now day out-of-doors,

though the tones of morning were feeble and wan, and it was long

before the sun would be perceptible in this overshadowed vale. 

Not a sound came from any of the out-houses as yet.  The tree-

trunks, the road, the out-buildings, the garden, every object wore

that aspect of mesmeric fixity which the suspensive quietude of

daybreak lends to such scenes.  Outside her window helpless

immobility seemed to be combined with intense consciousness; a

meditative inertness possessed all things, oppressively

contrasting with her own active emotions.  Beyond the road were

some cottage roofs and orchards; over these roofs and over the

apple-trees behind, high up the slope, and backed by the

plantation on the crest, was the house yet occupied by her future

husband, the rough-cast front showing whitely through its

creepers.  The window-shutters were closed, the bedroom curtains

closely drawn, and not the thinnest coil of smoke rose from the

rugged chimneys.



Something broke the stillness.  The front door of the house she

was gazing at opened softly, and there came out into the porch a

female figure, wrapped in a large shawl, beneath which was visible

the white skirt of a long loose garment.  A gray arm, stretching

from within the porch, adjusted the shawl over the woman's

shoulders; it was withdrawn and disappeared, the door closing

behind her.



The woman went quickly down the box-edged path between the

raspberries and currants, and as she walked her well-developed

form and gait betrayed her individuality.  It was Suke Damson, the

affianced one of simple young Tim Tangs.  At the bottom of the

garden she entered the shelter of the tall hedge, and only the top

of her head could be seen hastening in the direction of her own

dwelling.



Grace had recognized, or thought she recognized, in the gray arm

stretching from the porch, the sleeve of a dressing-gown which Mr.

Fitzpiers had been wearing on her own memorable visit to him.  Her

face fired red.  She had just before thought of dressing herself

and taking a lonely walk under the trees, so coolly green this

early morning; but she now sat down on her bed and fell into

reverie.  It seemed as if hardly any time had passed when she

heard the household moving briskly about, and breakfast preparing

down-stairs; though, on rousing herself to robe and descend, she

found that the sun was throwing his rays completely over the tree-

tops, a progress of natural phenomena denoting that at least three

hours had elapsed since she last looked out of the window.



When attired she searched about the house for her father; she

found him at last in the garden, stooping to examine the potatoes 

for signs of disease.  Hearing her rustle, he stood up and

stretched his back and arms, saying, "Morning t'ye, Gracie.  I

congratulate ye.  It is only a month to-day to the time!"



She did not answer, but, without lifting her dress, waded between

the dewy rows of tall potato-green into the middle of the plot

where he was.



"I have been thinking very much about my position this morning--

ever since it was light," she began, excitedly, and trembling so

that she could hardly stand.  "And I feel it is a false one.  I

wish not to marry Mr. Fitzpiers.  I wish not to marry anybody; but

I'll marry Giles Winterborne if you say I must as an alternative."



Her father's face settled into rigidity, he turned pale, and came

deliberately out of the plot before he answered her.  She had

never seen him look so incensed before.



"Now, hearken to me," he said.  "There's a time for a woman to

alter her mind; and there's a time when she can no longer alter

it, if she has any right eye to her parents' honor and the

seemliness of things.  That time has come.  I won't say to ye, you

SHALL marry him.  But I will say that if you refuse, I shall

forever be ashamed and a-weary of ye as a daughter, and shall look

upon you as the hope of my life no more.  What do you know about

life and what it can bring forth, and how you ought to act to lead

up to best ends?  Oh, you are an ungrateful maid, Grace; you've

seen that fellow Giles, and he has got over ye; that's where the

secret lies, I'll warrant me!"



"No, father, no! It is not Giles--it is something I cannot tell

you of--"



"Well, make fools of us all; make us laughing-stocks; break it

off; have your own way."



"But who knows of the engagement as yet? how can breaking it

disgrace you?"



Melbury then by degrees admitted that he had mentioned the

engagement to this acquaintance and to that, till she perceived

that in his restlessness and pride he had published it everywhere. 

She went dismally away to a bower of laurel at the top of the

garden.  Her father followed her.



"It is that Giles Winterborne!" he said, with an upbraiding gaze

at her.



"No, it is not; though for that matter you encouraged him once,"

she said, troubled to the verge of despair.  "It is not Giles, it

is Mr. Fitzpiers."



"You've had a tiff--a lovers' tiff--that's all, I suppose



"It is some woman--"



"Ay, ay; you are jealous.  The old story.  Don't tell me.  Now do

you bide here.  I'll send Fitzpiers to you. I saw him smoking in

front of his house but a minute by-gone."



He went off hastily out of the garden-gate and down the lane.  But

she would not stay where she was; and edging through a slit in the

garden-fence, walked away into the wood.  Just about here the

trees were large and wide apart, and there was no undergrowth, so

that she could be seen to some distance; a sylph-like, greenish-

white creature, as toned by the sunlight and leafage.  She heard a

foot-fall crushing dead leaves behind her, and found herself

reconnoitered by Fitzpiers himself, approaching gay and fresh as

the morning around them.



His remote gaze at her had been one of mild interest rather than

of rapture.  But she looked so lovely in the green world about

her, her pink cheeks, her simple light dress, and the delicate

flexibility of her movement acquired such rarity from their wild-

wood setting, that his eyes kindled as he drew near.



"My darling, what is it?  Your father says you are in the pouts,

and jealous, and I don't know what.  Ha! ha! ha! as if there were

any rival to you, except vegetable nature, in this home of

recluses! We know better."



"Jealous; oh no, it is not so," said she, gravely.  "That's a

mistake of his and yours, sir.  I spoke to him so closely about

the question of marriage with you that he did not apprehend my

state of mind."



"But there's something wrong--eh?" he asked, eying her narrowly,

and bending to kiss her.  She shrank away, and his purposed kiss

miscarried.



"What is it?" he said, more seriously for this little defeat.




She made no answer beyond, "Mr. Fitzpiers, I have had no

breakfast, I must go in."



"Come," he insisted, fixing his eyes upon her.  "Tell me at once,

I say."



It was the greater strength against the smaller; but she was

mastered less by his manner than by her own sense of the

unfairness of silence.  "I looked out of the window," she said,

with hesitation.  "I'll tell you by-and-by.  I must go in-doors. 

I have had no breakfast."



By a sort of divination his conjecture went straight to the fact. 

"Nor I," said he, lightly.  "Indeed, I rose late to-day.  I have

had a broken night, or rather morning.  A girl of the village--I

don't know her name--came and rang at my bell as soon as it was

light--between four and five, I should think it was--perfectly

maddened with an aching tooth.  As no-body heard her ring, she

threw some gravel at my window, till at last I heard her and

slipped on my dressing-gown and went down.  The poor thing begged

me with tears in her eyes to take out her tormentor, if I dragged

her head off.  Down she sat and out it came--a lovely molar, not a

speck upon it; and off she went with it in her handkerchief, much

contented, though it would have done good work for her for fifty

years to come."



It was all so plausible--so completely explained.  knowing nothing

of the incident in the wood on old Midsummer-eve, Grace felt that

her suspicions were unworthy and absurd, and with the readiness of

an honest heart she jumped at the opportunity of honoring his

word.  At the moment of her mental liberation the bushes about the

garden had moved, and her father emerged into the shady glade. 

"Well, I hope it is made up?" he said, cheerily.



"Oh yes," said Fitzpiers, with his eyes fixed on Grace, whose eyes

were shyly bent downward.



"Now," said her father, "tell me, the pair of ye, that you still

mean to take one another for good and all; and on the strength o't

you shall have another couple of hundred paid down.  I swear it by

the name."



Fitzpiers took her hand.  "We declare it, do we not, my dear

Grace?" said he.



Relieved of her doubt, somewhat overawed, and ever anxious to

please, she was disposed to settle the matter; yet, womanlike, she

would not relinquish her opportunity of asking a concession of

some sort.  "If our wedding can be at church, I say yes," she

answered, in a measured voice.  "If not, I say no."



Fitzpiers was generous in his turn.  "It shall be so," he

rejoined, gracefully.  "To holy church we'll go, and much good may

it do us."



They returned through the bushes indoors, Grace walking, full of

thought between the other two, somewhat comforted, both by

Fitzpiers's ingenious explanation and by the sense that she was

not to be deprived of a religious ceremony.  "So let it be," she

said to herself.  "Pray God it is for the best."



From this hour there was no serious attempt at recalcitration on

her part.  Fitzpiers kept himself continually near her, dominating

any rebellious impulse, and shaping her will into passive

concurrence with all his desires.  Apart from his lover-like

anxiety to possess her, the few golden hundreds of the timber-

dealer, ready to hand, formed a warm background to Grace's lovely

face, and went some way to remove his uneasiness at the prospect

of endangering his professional and social chances by an alliance

with the family of a simple countryman.







The interim closed up its perspective surely and silently. 

Whenever Grace had any doubts of her position, the sense of

contracting time was like a shortening chamber: at other moments

she was comparatively blithe.  Day after day waxed and waned; the

one or two woodmen who sawed, shaped, spokeshaved on her father's

premises at this inactive season of the year, regularly came and

unlocked the doors in the morning, locked them in the evening,

supped, leaned over their garden-gates for a whiff of evening air,

and to catch any last and farthest throb of news from the outer

world, which entered and expired at Little Hintock like the

exhausted swell of a wave in some innermost cavern of some

innermost creek of an embayed sea; yet no news interfered with the

nuptial purpose at their neighbor's house.  The sappy green twig-

tips of the season's growth would not, she thought, be appreciably

woodier on the day she became a wife, so near was the time; the

tints of the foliage would hardly have changed.  Everything was so

much as usual that no itinerant stranger would have supposed a

woman's fate to be hanging in the balance at that summer's

decline.



But there were preparations, imaginable readily enough by those

who had special knowledge.  In the remote and fashionable town of

Sandbourne something was growing up under the hands of several

persons who had never seen Grace Melbury, never would see her, or

care anything about her at all, though their creation had such

interesting relation to her life that it would enclose her very

heart at a moment when that heart would beat, if not with more

emotional ardor, at least with more emotional turbulence than at

any previous time.



Why did Mrs. Dollery's van, instead of passing along at the end of

the smaller village to Great Hintock direct, turn one Saturday

night into Little Hintock Lane, and never pull up till it reached

Mr. Melbury's gates?  The gilding shine of evening fell upon a

large, flat box not less than a yard square, and safely tied with

cord, as it was handed out from under the tilt with a great deal

of care.  But it was not heavy for its size; Mrs. Dollery herself

carried it into the house.  Tim Tangs, the hollow-turner, Bawtree,

Suke Damson, and others, looked knowing, and made remarks to each

other as they watched its entrance.  Melbury stood at the door of

the timber-shed in the attitude of a man to whom such an arrival

was a trifling domestic detail with which he did not condescend to

be concerned.  Yet he well divined the contents of that box, and

was in truth all the while in a pleasant exaltation at the proof

that thus far, at any rate, no disappointment had supervened. 

While Mrs. Dollery remained--which was rather long, from her sense

of the importance of her errand--he went into the out-house; but

as soon as she had had her say, been paid, and had rumbled away,

he entered the dwelling, to find there what he knew he should

find--his wife and daughter in a flutter of excitement over the

wedding-gown, just arrived from the leading dress-maker of

Sandbourne watering-place aforesaid.



During these weeks Giles Winterborne was nowhere to be seen or

heard of.  At the close of his tenure in Hintock he had sold some

of his furniture, packed up the rest--a few pieces endeared by

associations, or necessary to his occupation--in the house of a

friendly neighbor, and gone away.  People said that a certain

laxity had crept into his life; that he had never gone near a

church latterly, and had been sometimes seen on Sundays with

unblacked boots, lying on his elbow under a tree, with a cynical

gaze at surrounding objects.  He was likely to return to Hintock

when the cider-making season came round, his apparatus being

stored there, and travel with his mill and press from village to

village.



The narrow interval that stood before the day diminished yet. 

There was in Grace's mind sometimes a certain anticipative

satisfaction, the satisfaction of feeling that she would be the

heroine of an hour; moreover, she was proud, as a cultivated

woman, to be the wife of a cultivated man.  It was an opportunity

denied very frequently to young women in her position, nowadays

not a few; those in whom parental discovery of the value of

education has implanted tastes which parental circles fail to

gratify.  But what an attenuation was this cold pride of the dream

of her youth, in which she had pictured herself walking in state

towards the altar, flushed by the purple light and bloom of her

own passion, without a single misgiving as to the sealing of the

bond, and fervently receiving as her due





"The homage of a thousand hearts; the fond, deep love of one."





Everything had been clear then, in imagination; now something was

undefined.  She had little carking anxieties; a curious

fatefulness seemed to rule her, and she experienced a mournful

want of some one to confide in.



The day loomed so big and nigh that her prophetic ear could, in

fancy, catch the noise of it, hear the murmur of the villagers as

she came out of church, imagine the jangle of the three thin-toned

Hintock bells.  The dialogues seemed to grow louder, and the ding-

ding-dong of those three crazed bells more persistent.  She awoke:

the morning had come.



Five hours later she was the wife of Fitzpiers.
