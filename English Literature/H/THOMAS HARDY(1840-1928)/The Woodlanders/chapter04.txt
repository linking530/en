There was now a distinct manifestation of morning in the air, and

presently the bleared white visage of a sunless winter day emerged

like a dead-born child.  The villagers everywhere had already

bestirred themselves, rising at this time of the year at the far

less dreary hour of absolute darkness.  It had been above an hour

earlier, before a single bird had untucked his head, that twenty

lights were struck in as many bedrooms, twenty pairs of shutters

opened, and twenty pairs of eyes stretched to the sky to forecast

the weather for the day.



Owls that had been catching mice in the out-houses, rabbits that

had been eating the wintergreens in the gardens, and stoats that

had been sucking the blood of the rabbits, discerning that their

human neighbors were on the move, discreetly withdrew from

publicity, and were seen and heard no more that day.



The daylight revealed the whole of Mr. Melbury's homestead, of

which the wagon-sheds had been an outlying erection.  It formed

three sides of an open quadrangle, and consisted of all sorts of

buildings, the largest and central one being the dwelling itself. 

The fourth side of the quadrangle was the public road.



It was a dwelling-house of respectable, roomy, almost dignified

aspect; which, taken with the fact that there were the remains of

other such buildings thereabout, indicated that Little Hintock had

at some time or other been of greater importance than now, as its

old name of Hintock St. Osmond also testified.  The house was of

no marked antiquity, yet of well-advanced age; older than a stale

novelty, but no canonized antique; faded, not hoary; looking at

you from the still distinct middle-distance of the early Georgian

time, and awakening on that account the instincts of reminiscence

more decidedly than the remoter and far grander memorials which

have to speak from the misty reaches of mediaevalism.  The faces,

dress, passions, gratitudes, and revenues of the great-great-

grandfathers and grandmothers who had been the first to gaze from

those rectangular windows, and had stood under that key-stoned

doorway, could be divined and measured by homely standards of to-

day.  It was a house in whose reverberations queer old personal

tales were yet audible if properly listened for; and not, as with

those of the castle and cloister, silent beyond the possibility of

echo.



The garden-front remained much as it had always been, and there

was a porch and entrance that way.  But the principal house-door

opened on the square yard or quadrangle towards the road, formerly

a regular carriage entrance, though the middle of the area was now

made use of for stacking timber, fagots, bundles, and other

products of the wood.  It was divided from the lane by a lichen-

coated wall, in which hung a pair of gates, flanked by piers out

of the perpendicular, with a round white ball on the top of each.



The building on the left of the enclosure was a long-backed

erection, now used for spar-making, sawing, crib-framing, and

copse-ware manufacture in general.  Opposite were the wagon-sheds

where Marty had deposited her spars.



Here Winterborne had remained after the girl's abrupt departure,

to see that the wagon-loads were properly made up.  Winterborne

was connected with the Melbury family in various ways.  In

addition to the sentimental relationship which arose from his

father having been the first Mrs. Melbury's lover, Winterborne's

aunt had married and emigrated with the brother of the timber-

merchant many years before--an alliance that was sufficient to

place Winterborne, though the poorer, on a footing of social

intimacy with the Melburys.  As in most villages so secluded as

this, intermarriages were of Hapsburgian frequency among the

inhabitants, and there were hardly two houses in Little Hintock

unrelated by some matrimonial tie or other.



For this reason a curious kind of partnership existed between

Melbury and the younger man--a partnership based upon an unwritten

code, by which each acted in the way he thought fair towards the

other, on a give-and-take principle.  Melbury, with his timber and

copse-ware business, found that the weight of his labor came in

winter and spring.  Winterborne was in the apple and cider trade,

and his requirements in cartage and other work came in the autumn

of each year.  Hence horses, wagons, and in some degree men, were

handed over to him when the apples began to fall; he, in return,

lending his assistance to Melbury in the busiest wood-cutting

season, as now.



Before he had left the shed a boy came from the house to ask him

to remain till Mr. Melbury had seen him.  Winterborne thereupon

crossed over to the spar-house where two or three men were already

at work, two of them being travelling spar-makers from White-hart

Lane, who, when this kind of work began, made their appearance

regularly, and when it was over disappeared in silence till the

season came again.



Firewood was the one thing abundant in Little Hintock; and a blaze

of gad-cuds made the outhouse gay with its light, which vied with

that of the day as yet.  In the hollow shades of the roof could be

seen dangling etiolated arms of ivy which had crept through the

joints of the tiles and were groping in vain for some support,

their leaves being dwarfed and sickly for want of sunlight; others

were pushing in with such force at the eaves as to lift from their

supports the shelves that were fixed there.



Besides the itinerant journey-workers there were also present John

Upjohn, engaged in the hollow-turnery trade, who lived hard by;

old Timothy Tangs and young Timothy Tangs, top and bottom sawyers,

at work in Mr. Melbury's pit outside; Farmer Bawtree, who kept the

cider-house, and Robert Creedle, an old man who worked for

Winterborne, and stood warming his hands; these latter being

enticed in by the ruddy blaze, though they had no particular

business there.  None of them call for any remark except, perhaps,

Creedle.  To have completely described him it would have been

necessary to write a military memoir, for he wore under his smock-

frock a cast-off soldier's jacket that had seen hot service, its

collar showing just above the flap of the frock; also a hunting

memoir, to include the top-boots that he had picked up by chance;

also chronicles of voyaging and shipwreck, for his pocket-knife

had been given him by a weather-beaten sailor.  But Creedle

carried about with him on his uneventful rounds these silent

testimonies of war, sport, and adventure, and thought nothing of

their associations or their stories.



Copse-work, as it was called, being an occupation which the

secondary intelligence of the hands and arms could carry on

without requiring the sovereign attention of the head, the minds

of its professors wandered considerably from the objects before

them; hence the tales, chronicles, and ramifications of family

history which were recounted here were of a very exhaustive kind,

and sometimes so interminable as to defy description.



Winterborne, seeing that Melbury had not arrived, stepped back

again outside the door; and the conversation interrupted by his

momentary presence flowed anew, reaching his ears as an

accompaniment to the regular dripping of the fog from the

plantation boughs around.



The topic at present handled was a highly popular and frequent

one--the personal character of Mrs. Charmond, the owner of the

surrounding woods and groves.



"My brother-in-law told me, and I have no reason to doubt it,"

said Creedle, "that she'd sit down to her dinner with a frock

hardly higher than her elbows.  'Oh, you wicked woman!' he said to

himself when he first see her, 'you go to your church, and sit,

and kneel, as if your knee-jints were greased with very saint's

anointment, and tell off your Hear-us-good-Lords like a business

man counting money; and yet you can eat your victuals such a

figure as that!' Whether she's a reformed character by this time I

can't say; but I don't care who the man is, that's how she went on

when my brother-in-law lived there."



"Did she do it in her husband's time?"



"That I don't know--hardly, I should think, considering his

temper.  Ah!" Here Creedle threw grieved remembrance into physical

form by slowly resigning his head to obliquity and letting his

eyes water.  "That man! 'Not if the angels of heaven come down,

Creedle,' he said, 'shall you do another day's work for me!' Yes--

he'd say anything--anything; and would as soon take a winged

creature's name in vain as yours or mine! Well, now I must get

these spars home-along, and to-morrow, thank God, I must see about

using 'em."



An old woman now entered upon the scene.  She was Mr. Melbury's

servant, and passed a great part of her time in crossing the yard

between the house-door and the spar-shed, whither she had come now

for fuel.  She had two facial aspects--one, of a soft and flexible

kind, she used indoors when assisting about the parlor or up-

stairs; the other, with stiff lines and corners, when she was

bustling among the men in the spar-house or out-of-doors.



"Ah, Grammer Oliver," said John Upjohn, "it do do my heart good to

see a old woman like you so dapper and stirring, when I bear in

mind that after fifty one year counts as two did afore! But your

smoke didn't rise this morning till twenty minutes past seven by

my beater; and that's late, Grammer Oliver."



"If you was a full-sized man, John, people might take notice of

your scornful meanings.  But your growing up was such a scrimped

and scanty business that really a woman couldn't feel hurt if you

were to spit fire and brimstone itself at her.  Here," she added,

holding out a spar-gad to one of the workmen, from which dangled a

long black-pudding--"here's something for thy breakfast, and if

you want tea you must fetch it from in-doors."



"Mr. Melbury is late this morning," said the bottom-sawyer.



"Yes.  'Twas a dark dawn," said Mrs. Oliver.  "Even when I opened

the door, so late as I was, you couldn't have told poor men from

gentlemen, or John from a reasonable-sized object.  And I don't

think maister's slept at all well to-night.  He's anxious about

his daughter; and I know what that is, for I've cried bucketfuls

for my own."



When the old woman had gone Creedle said,



"He'll fret his gizzard green if he don't soon hear from that maid

of his.  Well, learning is better than houses and lands.  But to

keep a maid at school till she is taller out of pattens than her

mother was in 'em--'tis tempting Providence."



"It seems no time ago that she was a little playward girl," said

young Timothy Tangs.



"I can mind her mother," said the hollow-turner.  "Always a teuny,

delicate piece; her touch upon your hand was as soft and cool as

wind.  She was inoculated for the small-pox and had it beautifully

fine, just about the time that I was out of my apprenticeship--ay,

and a long apprenticeship 'twas.  I served that master of mine six

years and three hundred and fourteen days."



The hollow-turner pronounced the days with emphasis, as if,

considering their number, they were a rather more remarkable fact

than the years.



"Mr. Winterborne's father walked with her at one time," said old

Timothy Tangs.  "But Mr. Melbury won her.  She was a child of a

woman, and would cry like rain if so be he huffed her.  Whenever

she and her husband came to a puddle in their walks together he'd

take her up like a half-penny doll and put her over without

dirting her a speck.  And if he keeps the daughter so long at

boarding-school, he'll make her as nesh as her mother was.  But

here he comes."



Just before this moment Winterborne had seen Melbury crossing the

court from his door.  He was carrying an open letter in his hand,

and came straight to Winterborne.  His gloom of the preceding

night had quite gone.



"I'd no sooner made up my mind, Giles, to go and see why Grace

didn't come or write than I get a letter from her--'Clifton:

Wednesday.  My dear father,' says she, 'I'm coming home to-morrow'

(that's to-day), 'but I didn't think it worth while to write long

beforehand.' The little rascal, and didn't she! Now, Giles, as you

are going to Sherton market to-day with your apple-trees, why not

join me and Grace there, and we'll drive home all together?"



He made the proposal with cheerful energy; he was hardly the same

man as the man of the small dark hours.  Ever it happens that even

among the moodiest the tendency to be cheered is stronger than the

tendency to be cast down; and a soul's specific gravity stands

permanently less than that of the sea of troubles into which it is

thrown.



Winterborne, though not demonstrative, replied to this suggestion

with something like alacrity.  There was not much doubt that

Marty's grounds for cutting off her hair were substantial enough,

if Ambrose's eyes had been a reason for keeping it on.  As for the

timber-merchant, it was plain that his invitation had been given

solely in pursuance of his scheme for uniting the pair.  He had

made up his mind to the course as a duty, and was strenuously bent

upon following it out.



Accompanied by Winterborne, he now turned towards the door of the

spar-house, when his footsteps were heard by the men as aforesaid.



"Well, John, and Lot," he said, nodding as he entered.  "A rimy

morning."



"'Tis, sir!" said Creedle, energetically; for, not having as yet

been able to summon force sufficient to go away and begin work, he

felt the necessity of throwing some into his speech.  "I don't

care who the man is, 'tis the rimiest morning we've had this

fall."



"I heard you wondering why I've kept my daughter so long at

boarding-school," resumed Mr. Melbury, looking up from the letter

which he was reading anew by the fire, and turning to them with

the suddenness that was a trait in him.  "Hey?" he asked, with

affected shrewdness.  "But you did, you know.  Well, now, though

it is my own business more than anybody else's, I'll tell ye. 

When I was a boy, another boy--the pa'son's son--along with a lot

of others, asked me 'Who dragged Whom round the walls of What?'

and I said, 'Sam Barrett, who dragged his wife in a chair round

the tower corner when she went to be churched.' They laughed at me

with such torrents of scorn that I went home ashamed, and couldn't

sleep for shame; and I cried that night till my pillow was wet:

till at last I thought to myself there and then--'They may laugh

at me for my ignorance, but that was father's fault, and none o'

my making, and I must bear it.  But they shall never laugh at my

children, if I have any: I'll starve first!' Thank God, I've been

able to keep her at school without sacrifice; and her scholarship

is such that she stayed on as governess for a time.  Let 'em laugh

now if they can: Mrs. Charmond herself is not better informed than

my girl Grace."



There was something between high indifference and humble emotion

in his delivery, which made it difficult for them to reply. 

Winterborne's interest was of a kind which did not show itself in

words; listening, he stood by the fire, mechanically stirring the

embers with a spar-gad.



"You'll be, then, ready, Giles?" Melbury continued, awaking from a

reverie.  "Well, what was the latest news at Shottsford yesterday,

Mr. Bawtree?"



"Well, Shottsford is Shottsford still--you can't victual your

carcass there unless you've got money; and you can't buy a cup of

genuine there, whether or no....But as the saying is, 'Go abroad

and you'll hear news of home.' It seems that our new neighbor,

this young Dr. What's-his-name, is a strange, deep, perusing

gentleman; and there's good reason for supposing he has sold his

soul to the wicked one."



"'Od name it all," murmured the timber-merchant, unimpressed by

the news, but reminded of other things by the subject of it; "I've

got to meet a gentleman this very morning? and yet I've planned to

go to Sherton Abbas for the maid."



"I won't praise the doctor's wisdom till I hear what sort of

bargain he's made," said the top-sawyer.



"'Tis only an old woman's tale," said Bawtree.  "But it seems that

he wanted certain books on some mysterious science or black-art,

and in order that the people hereabout should not know anything

about his dark readings, he ordered 'em direct from London, and

not from the Sherton book-seller.  The parcel was delivered by

mistake at the pa'son's, and he wasn't at home; so his wife opened

it, and went into hysterics when she read 'em, thinking her

husband had turned heathen, and 'twould be the ruin of the

children.  But when he came he said he knew no more about 'em than

she; and found they were this Mr. Fitzpier's property.  So he

wrote 'Beware!' outside, and sent 'em on by the sexton."



"He must be a curious young man," mused the hollow-turner.



"He must," said Timothy Tangs.



"Nonsense," said Mr. Melbury, authoritatively, "he's only a

gentleman fond of science and philosophy and poetry, and, in fact,

every kind of knowledge; and being lonely here, he passes his time

in making such matters his hobby."



"Well," said old Timothy, "'tis a strange thing about doctors that

the worse they be the better they be.  I mean that if you hear

anything of this sort about 'em, ten to one they can cure ye as

nobody else can."



"True," said Bawtree, emphatically.  "And for my part I shall take

my custom from old Jones and go to this one directly I've anything

the matter with me.  That last medicine old Jones gave me had no

taste in it at all."



Mr. Melbury, as became a well-informed man, did not listen to

these recitals, being moreover preoccupied with the business

appointment which had come into his head.  He walked up and down,

looking on the floor--his usual custom when undecided.  That

stiffness about the arm, hip, and knee-joint which was apparent

when he walked was the net product of the divers sprains and over-

exertions that had been required of him in handling trees and

timber when a young man, for he was of the sort called self-made,

and had worked hard.  He knew the origin of every one of these

cramps: that in his left shoulder had come of carrying a pollard,

unassisted, from Tutcombe Bottom home; that in one leg was caused

by the crash of an elm against it when they were felling; that in

the other was from lifting a bole.  On many a morrow after

wearying himself by these prodigious muscular efforts, he had

risen from his bed fresh as usual; his lassitude had departed,

apparently forever; and confident in the recuperative power of his

youth, he had repeated the strains anew.  But treacherous Time had

been only hiding ill results when they could be guarded against,

for greater accumulation when they could not.  In his declining

years the store had been unfolded in the form of rheumatisms,

pricks, and spasms, in every one of which Melbury recognized some

act which, had its consequence been contemporaneously made known,

he would wisely have abstained from repeating.



On a summons by Grammer Oliver to breakfast, he left the shed. 

Reaching the kitchen, where the family breakfasted in winter to

save house-labor, he sat down by the fire, and looked a long time

at the pair of dancing shadows cast by each fire-iron and dog-knob

on the whitewashed chimney-corner--a yellow one from the window,

and a blue one from the fire.



"I don't quite know what to do to-day," he said to his wife at

last.  "I've recollected that I promised to meet Mrs. Charmond's

steward in Round Wood at twelve o'clock, and yet I want to go for

Grace."



"Why not let Giles fetch her by himself? 'Twill bring 'em together

all the quicker."



"I could do that--but I should like to go myself.  I always have

gone, without fail, every time hitherto.  It has been a great

pleasure to drive into Sherton, and wait and see her arrive; and

perhaps she'll be disappointed if I stay away."



"Yon may be disappointed, but I don't think she will, if you send

Giles," said Mrs. Melbury, dryly.



"Very well--I'll send him."



Melbury was often persuaded by the quietude of his wife's words

when strenuous argument would have had no effect.  This second

Mrs. Melbury was a placid woman, who had been nurse to his child

Grace before her mother's death.  After that melancholy event

little Grace had clung to the nurse with much affection; and

ultimately Melbury, in dread lest the only woman who cared for the

girl should be induced to leave her, persuaded the mild Lucy to

marry him.  The arrangement--for it was little more--had worked

satisfactorily enough; Grace had thriven, and Melbury had not

repented.



He returned to the spar-house and found Giles near at hand, to

whom he explained the change of plan.  "As she won't arrive till

five o'clock, you can get your business very well over in time to

receive her," said Melbury.  "The green gig will do for her;

you'll spin along quicker with that, and won't be late upon the

road.  Her boxes can be called for by one of the wagons."



Winterborne, knowing nothing of the timber-merchant's restitutory

aims, quietly thought all this to be a kindly chance.  Wishing

even more than her father to despatch his apple-tree business in

the market before Grace's arrival, he prepared to start at once.



Melbury was careful that the turnout should be seemly.  The gig-

wheels, for instance, were not always washed during winter-time

before a journey, the muddy roads rendering that labor useless;

but they were washed to-day.  The harness was blacked, and when

the rather elderly white horse had been put in, and Winterborne

was in his seat ready to start, Mr. Melbury stepped out with a

blacking-brush, and with his own hands touched over the yellow

hoofs of the animal.



"You see, Giles," he said, as he blacked, "coming from a

fashionable school, she might feel shocked at the homeliness of

home; and 'tis these little things that catch a dainty woman's eye

if they are neglected.  We, living here alone, don't notice how

the whitey-brown creeps out of the earth over us; but she, fresh

from a city--why, she'll notice everything!"



"That she will," said Giles.



"And scorn us if we don't mind."



"Not scorn us."



"No, no, no--that's only words.  She's too good a girl to do that. 

But when we consider what she knows, and what she has seen since

she last saw us, 'tis as well to meet her views as nearly as

possible.  Why, 'tis a year since she was in this old place, owing

to her going abroad in the summer, which I agreed to, thinking it

best for her; and naturally we shall look small, just at first--I

only say just at first."



Mr. Melbury's tone evinced a certain exultation in the very sense

of that inferiority he affected to deplore; for this advanced and

refined being, was she not his own all the time?  Not so Giles; he

felt doubtful--perhaps a trifle cynical--for that strand was wound

into him with the rest.  He looked at his clothes with misgiving,

then with indifference.



It was his custom during the planting season to carry a specimen

apple-tree to market with him as an advertisement of what he dealt

in.  This had been tied across the gig; and as it would be left

behind in the town, it would cause no inconvenience to Miss Grace

Melbury coming home.



He drove away, the twigs nodding with each step of the horse; and

Melbury went in-doors.  Before the gig had passed out of sight,

Mr. Melbury reappeared and shouted after--



"Here, Giles, "he said, breathlessly following with some wraps,

"it may be very chilly to-night, and she may want something extra

about her.  And, Giles," he added, when the young man, having

taken the articles, put the horse in motion once more, "tell her

that I should have come myself, but I had particular business with

Mrs. Charmond's agent, which prevented me.  Don't forget."



He watched Winterborne out of sight, saying, with a jerk--a shape

into which emotion with him often resolved itself--"There, now, I

hope the two will bring it to a point and have done with it! 'Tis

a pity to let such a girl throw herself away upon him--a thousand

pities!...And yet 'tis my duty for his father's sake."
