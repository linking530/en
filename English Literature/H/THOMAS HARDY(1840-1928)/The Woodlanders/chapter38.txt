At these warm words Winterborne was not less dazed than he was

moved in heart.  The novelty of the avowal rendered what it

carried with it inapprehensible by him in its entirety.



Only a few short months ago completely estranged from this family--

beholding Grace going to and fro in the distance, clothed with

the alienating radiance of obvious superiority, the wife of the

then popular and fashionable Fitzpiers, hopelessly outside his

social boundary down to so recent a time that flowers then folded

were hardly faded yet--he was now asked by that jealously guarding

father of hers to take courage--to get himself ready for the day

when he should be able to claim her.



The old times came back to him in dim procession.  How he had been

snubbed; how Melbury had despised his Christmas party; how that

sweet, coy Grace herself had looked down upon him and his

household arrangements, and poor Creedle's contrivances!



Well, he could not believe it.  Surely the adamantine barrier of

marriage with another could not be pierced like this! It did

violence to custom.  Yet a new law might do anything.  But was it

at all within the bounds of probability that a woman who, over and

above her own attainments, had been accustomed to those of a

cultivated professional man, could ever be the wife of such as he?



Since the date of his rejection he had almost grown to see the

reasonableness of that treatment.  He had said to himself again

and again that her father was right; that the poor ceorl, Giles

Winterborne, would never have been able to make such a dainty girl

happy.  Yet, now that she had stood in a position farther removed

from his own than at first, he was asked to prepare to woo her. 

He was full of doubt.



Nevertheless, it was not in him to show backwardness.  To act so

promptly as Melbury desired him to act seemed, indeed, scarcely

wise, because of the uncertainty of events.  Giles knew nothing of

legal procedure, but he did know that for him to step up to Grace

as a lover before the bond which bound her was actually dissolved

was simply an extravagant dream of her father's overstrained mind. 

He pitied Melbury for his almost childish enthusiasm, and saw that

the aging man must have suffered acutely to be weakened to this

unreasoning desire.



Winterborne was far too magnanimous to harbor any cynical

conjecture that the timber-merchant, in his intense affection for

Grace, was courting him now because that young lady, when

disunited, would be left in an anomalous position, to escape which

a bad husband was better than none.  He felt quite sure that his

old friend was simply on tenterhooks of anxiety to repair the

almost irreparable error of dividing two whom Nature had striven

to join together in earlier days, and that in his ardor to do this

he was oblivious of formalities. The cautious supervision of his

past years had overleaped itself at last.  hence, Winterborne

perceived that, in this new beginning, the necessary care not to

compromise Grace by too early advances must be exercised by

himself.



Perhaps Winterborne was not quite so ardent as heretofore.  There

is no such thing as a stationary love: men are either loving more

or loving less.  But Giles himself recognized no decline in his

sense of her dearness.  If the flame did indeed burn lower now

than when he had fetched her from Sherton at her last return from

school, the marvel was small.  He had been laboring ever since his

rejection and her marriage to reduce his former passion to a

docile friendship, out of pure regard to its expediency; and their

separation may have helped him to a partial success.



A week and more passed, and there was no further news of Melbury. 

But the effect of the intelligence he had already transmitted upon

the elastic-nerved daughter of the woods had been much what the

old surgeon Jones had surmised.  It had soothed her perturbed

spirit better than all the opiates in the pharmacopoeia.  She had

slept unbrokenly a whole night and a day.  The "new law" was to

her a mysterious, beneficent, godlike entity, lately descended

upon earth, that would make her as she once had been without

trouble or annoyance.  Her position fretted her, its abstract

features rousing an aversion which was even greater than her

aversion to the personality of him who had caused it.  It was

mortifying, productive of slights, undignified.  Him she could

forget; her circumstances she had always with her.



She saw nothing of Winterborne during the days of her recovery;

and perhaps on that account her fancy wove about him a more

romantic tissue than it could have done if he had stood before her

with all the specks and flaws inseparable from corporeity.  He

rose upon her memory as the fruit-god and the wood-god in

alternation; sometimes leafy, and smeared with green lichen, as

she had seen him among the sappy boughs of the plantations;

sometimes cider-stained, and with apple-pips in the hair of his

arms, as she had met him on his return from cider-making in White

Hart Vale, with his vats and presses beside him.  In her secret

heart she almost approximated to her father's enthusiasm in

wishing to show Giles once for all how she still regarded him. 

The question whether the future would indeed bring them together

for life was a standing wonder with her.  She knew that it could

not with any propriety do so just yet.  But reverently believing

in her father's sound judgment and knowledge, as good girls are 

wont to do, she remembered what he had written about her giving a

hint to Winterborne lest there should be risk in delay, and her

feelings were not averse to such a step, so far as it could be

done without danger at this early stage of the proceedings.



From being a frail phantom of her former equable self she returned

in bounds to a condition of passable philosophy.  She bloomed

again in the face in the course of a few days, and was well enough

to go about as usual.  One day Mrs. Melbury proposed that for a

change she should be driven in the gig to Sherton market, whither

Melbury's man was going on other errands.  Grace had no business

whatever in Sherton; but it crossed her mind that Winterborne

would probably be there, and this made the thought of such a drive

interesting.



On the way she saw nothing of him; but when the horse was walking

slowly through the obstructions of Sheep Street, she discerned the

young man on the pavement.  She thought of that time when he had

been standing under his apple-tree on her return from school, and

of the tender opportunity then missed through her fastidiousness. 

Her heart rose in her throat.  She abjured all such fastidiousness

now.  Nor did she forget the last occasion on which she had beheld

him in that town, making cider in the court-yard of the Earl of

Wessex Hotel, while she was figuring as a fine lady in the balcony

above.



Grace directed the man to set her down there in the midst, and

immediately went up to her lover.  Giles had not before observed

her, and his eyes now suppressedly looked his pleasure, without

the embarrassment that had formerly marked him at such meetings.



When a few words had been spoken, she said, archly, "I have

nothing to do.  Perhaps you are deeply engaged?"



"I?  Not a bit.  My business now at the best of times is small, I

am sorry to say."



"Well, then, I am going into the Abbey.  Come along with me."



The proposition had suggested itself as a quick escape from

publicity, for many eyes were regarding her.  She had hoped that

sufficient time had elapsed for the extinction of curiosity; but

it was quite otherwise.  The people looked at her with tender

interest as the deserted girl-wife--without obtrusiveness, and

without vulgarity; but she was ill prepared for scrutiny in any

shape.



They walked about the Abbey aisles, and presently sat down.  Not a

soul was in the building save themselves.  She regarded a stained

window, with her head sideways, and tentatively asked him if he

remembered the last time they were in that town alone.



He remembered it perfectly, and remarked, "You were a proud miss

then, and as dainty as you were high.  Perhaps you are now?"



Grace slowly shook her head.  "Affliction has taken all that out

of me," she answered, impressively.  "Perhaps I am too far the

other way now." As there was something lurking in this that she

could not explain, she added, so quickly as not to allow him time

to think of it, "Has my father written to you at all?"



"Yes," said Winterborne.



She glanced ponderingly up at him.  "Not about me?"



"Yes."



His mouth was lined with charactery which told her that he had

been bidden to take the hint as to the future which she had been

bidden to give.  The unexpected discovery sent a scarlet pulsation

through Grace for the moment.  However, it was only Giles who

stood there, of whom she had no fear; and her self-possession

returned.



"He said I was to sound you with a view to--what you will 

understand, if you care to," continued Winterborne, in a low

voice.  Having been put on this track by herself, he was not

disposed to abandon it in a hurry.



They had been children together, and there was between them that

familiarity as to personal affairs which only such

acquaintanceship can give.  "You know, Giles," she answered,

speaking in a very practical tone, "that that is all very well;

but I am in a very anomalous position at present, and I cannot say

anything to the point about such things as those."



"No?" he said, with a stray air as regarded the subject.  He was

looking at her with a curious consciousness of discovery.  He had

not been imagining that their renewed intercourse would show her

to him thus.  For the first time he realized an unexpectedness in

her, which, after all, should not have been unexpected.  She

before him was not the girl Grace Melbury whom he used to know. 

Of course, he might easily have prefigured as much; but it had

never occurred to him.  She was a woman who had been married; she

had moved on; and without having lost her girlish modesty, she had

lost her girlish shyness.  The inevitable change, though known to

him, had not been heeded; and it struck him into a momentary

fixity.  The truth was that he had never come into close

comradeship with her since her engagement to Fitzpiers, with the

brief exception of the evening encounter on Rubdown Hill, when she

met him with his cider apparatus; and that interview had been of

too cursory a kind for insight.



Winterborne had advanced, too.  He could criticise her.  Times had

been when to criticise a single trait in Grace Melbury would have

lain as far beyond his powers as to criticise a deity.  This thing

was sure: it was a new woman in many ways whom he had come out to

see; a creature of more ideas, more dignity, and, above all, more

assurance, than the original Grace had been capable of.  He could

not at first decide whether he were pleased or displeased at this. 

But upon the whole the novelty attracted him.



She was so sweet and sensitive that she feared his silence

betokened something in his brain of the nature of an enemy to her. 

"What are you thinking of that makes those lines come in your

forehead?" she asked.  "I did not mean to offend you by speaking

of the time being premature as yet."



Touched by the genuine loving-kindness which had lain at the

foundation of these words, and much moved, Winterborne turned his

face aside, as he took her by the hand.  He was grieved that he

had criticised her.



"You are very good, dear Grace," he said, in a low voice.  "You

are better, much better, than you used to be."



"How?"



He could not very well tell her how, and said, with an evasive

smile, "You are prettier;" which was not what he really had meant. 

He then remained still holding her right hand in his own right, so

that they faced in opposite ways; and as he did not let go, she

ventured upon a tender remonstrance.



"I think we have gone as far as we ought to go at present--and far

enough to satisfy my poor father that we are the same as ever. 

You see, Giles, my case is not settled yet, and if--Oh, suppose I

NEVER get free!--there should be any hitch or informality!"



She drew a catching breath, and turned pale.  The dialogue had

been affectionate comedy up to this point.  The gloomy atmosphere

of the past, and the still gloomy horizon of the present, had been

for the interval forgotten.  Now the whole environment came back,

the due balance of shade among the light was restored.



"It is sure to be all right, I trust?" she resumed, in uneasy

accents.  "What did my father say the solicitor had told him?"



"Oh--that all is sure enough.  The case is so clear--nothing could

be clearer.  But the legal part is not yet quite done and

finished, as is natural."



"Oh no--of course not," she said, sunk in meek thought.  "But

father said it was ALMOST--did he not? Do you know anything about

the new law that makes these things so easy?"



"Nothing--except the general fact that it enables ill-assorted

husbands and wives to part in a way they could not formerly do

without an Act of Parliament."



"Have you to sign a paper, or swear anything? Is it something like

that?"



"Yes, I believe so."



"How long has it been introduced?"



"About six months or a year, the lawyer said, I think."



To hear these two poor Arcadian innocents talk of imperial law

would have made a humane person weep who should have known what a

dangerous structure they were building up on their supposed

knowledge.  They remained in thought, like children in the

presence of the incomprehensible.



"Giles," she said, at last, "it makes me quite weary when I think

how serious my situation is, or has been.  Shall we not go out

from here now, as it may seem rather fast of me--our being so long

together, I mean--if anybody were to see us? I am almost sure,"

she added, uncertainly, "that I ought not to let you hold my hand

yet, knowing that the documents--or whatever it may be--have not

been signed; so that I--am still as married as ever--or almost. 

My dear father has forgotten himself.  Not that I feel morally

bound to any one else, after what has taken place--no woman of

spirit could--now, too, that several months have passed.  But I

wish to keep the proprieties as well as I can."



"Yes, yes.  Still, your father reminds us that life is short.  I

myself feel that it is; that is why I wished to understand you in

this that we have begun.  At times, dear Grace, since receiving

your father's letter, I am as uneasy and fearful as a child at

what he said.  If one of us were to die before the formal signing

and sealing that is to release you have been done--if we should

drop out of the world and never have made the most of this little,

short, but real opportunity, I should think to myself as I sunk

down dying, 'Would to my God that I had spoken out my whole heart--

given her one poor little kiss when I had the chance to give it!

But I never did, although she had promised to be mine some day;

and now I never can.' That's what I should think."



She had begun by watching the words from his lips with a mournful

regard, as though their passage were visible; but as he went on

she dropped her glance.  "Yes," she said, "I have thought that,

too.  And, because I have thought it, I by no means meant, in

speaking of the proprieties, to be reserved and cold to you who

loved me so long ago, or to hurt your heart as I used to do at

that thoughtless time.  Oh, not at all, indeed! But--ought I to

allow you?--oh, it is too quick--surely!"  Her eyes filled with

tears of bewildered, alarmed emotion.



Winterborne was too straightforward to influence her further

against her better judgment.  "Yes--I suppose it is," he said,

repentantly.  "I'll wait till all is settled.  What did your

father say in that last letter?"



He meant about his progress with the petition; but she, mistaking

him, frankly spoke of the personal part.  "He said--what I have

implied.  Should I tell more plainly?"



"Oh no--don't, if it is a secret."



"Not at all.  I will tell every word, straight out, Giles, if you

wish.  He said I was to encourage you.  There.  But I cannot obey

him further to-day.  Come, let us go now." She gently slid her

hand from his, and went in front of him out of the Abbey.



"I was thinking of getting some dinner," said Winterborne,

changing to the prosaic, as they walked.  "And you, too, must

require something.  Do let me take you to a place I know."



Grace was almost without a friend in the world outside her

father's house; her life with Fitzpiers had brought her no

society; had sometimes, indeed, brought her deeper solitude and

inconsideration than any she had ever known before.  Hence it was

a treat to her to find herself again the object of thoughtful

care.  But she questioned if to go publicly to dine with Giles

Winterborne were not a proposal, due rather to his

unsophistication than to his discretion.  She said gently that she

would much prefer his ordering her lunch at some place and then

coming to tell her it was ready, while she remained in the Abbey

porch.  Giles saw her secret reasoning, thought how hopelessly

blind to propriety he was beside her, and went to do as she

wished.



He was not absent more than ten minutes, and found Grace where he

had left her.  "It will be quite ready by the time you get there,"

he said, and told her the name of the inn at which the meal had

been ordered, which was one that she had never heard of.



"I'll find it by inquiry," said Grace, setting out.



"And shall I see you again?"



"Oh yes--come to me there.  It will not be like going together.  I

shall want you to find my father's man and the gig for me."



He waited on some ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, till he

thought her lunch ended, and that he might fairly take advantage

of her invitation to start her on her way home.  He went straight

to The Three Tuns--a little tavern in a side street, scrupulously

clean, but humble and inexpensive.  On his way he had an

occasional misgiving as to whether the place had been elegant

enough for her; and as soon as he entered it, and saw her

ensconced there, he perceived that he had blundered.



Grace was seated in the only dining-room that the simple old

hostelry could boast of, which was also a general parlor on

market-days; a long, low apartment, with a sanded floor herring-

boned with a broom; a wide, red-curtained window to the street,

and another to the garden.  Grace had retreated to the end of the

room looking out upon the latter, the front part being full of a

mixed company which had dropped in since he was there.



She was in a mood of the greatest depression.  On arriving, and

seeing what the tavern was like, she had been taken by surprise;

but having gone too far to retreat, she had heroically entered and

sat down on the well-scrubbed settle, opposite the narrow table

with its knives and steel forks, tin pepper-boxes, blue salt-

cellars, and posters advertising the sale of bullocks against the

wall.  The last time that she had taken any meal in a public place

it had been with Fitzpiers at the grand new Earl of Wessex Hotel

in that town, after a two months' roaming and sojourning at the

gigantic hotels of the Continent.  How could she have expected any

other kind of accommodation in present circumstances than such as

Giles had provided? And yet how unprepared she was for this

change! The tastes that she had acquired from Fitzpiers had been

imbibed so subtly that she hardly knew she possessed them till

confronted by this contrast.  The elegant Fitzpiers, in fact, at

that very moment owed a long bill at the above-mentioned hotel for

the luxurious style in which he used to put her up there whenever

they drove to Sherton.  But such is social sentiment, that she had

been quite comfortable under those debt-impending conditions,

while she felt humiliated by her present situation, which

Winterborne had paid for honestly on the nail.



He had noticed in a moment that she shrunk from her position, and

all his pleasure was gone.  It was the same susceptibility over

again which had spoiled his Christmas party long ago.



But he did not know that this recrudescence was only the casual

result of Grace's apprenticeship to what she was determined to

learn in spite of it--a consequence of one of those sudden

surprises which confront everybody bent upon turning over a new

leaf.  She had finished her lunch, which he saw had been a very

mincing performance; and he brought her out of the house as soon

as he could.



"Now," he said, with great sad eyes, "you have not finished at all

well, I know.  Come round to the Earl of Wessex.  I'll order a tea

there.  I did not remember that what was good enough for me was


not good enough for you."



Her face faded into an aspect of deep distress when she saw what

had happened.  "Oh no, Giles," she said, with extreme pathos;

"certainly not.  Why do you--say that when you know better?  You

EVER will misunderstand me."



"Indeed, that's not so, Mrs. Fitzpiers.  Can you deny that you

felt out of place at The Three Tuns?"



"I don't know.  Well, since you make me speak, I do not deny it."



"And yet I have felt at home there these twenty years.  Your

husband used always to take you to the Earl of Wessex, did he

not?"



"Yes," she reluctantly admitted.  How could she explain in the

street of a market-town that it was her superficial and transitory

taste which had been offended, and not her nature or her

affection? Fortunately, or unfortunately, at that moment they saw

Melbury's man driving vacantly along the street in search of her,

the hour having passed at which he had been told to take her up. 

Winterborne hailed him, and she was powerless then to prolong the

discourse.  She entered the vehicle sadly, and the horse trotted

away.
