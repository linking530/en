She walked up the soft grassy ride, screened on either hand by

nut-bushes, just now heavy with clusters of twos and threes and

fours.  A little way on, the track she pursued was crossed by a

similar one at right angles.  Here Grace stopped; some few yards

up the transverse ride the buxom Suke Damson was visible--her gown

tucked up high through her pocket-hole, and no bonnet on her head--

in the act of pulling down boughs from which she was gathering

and eating nuts with great rapidity, her lover Tim Tangs standing

near her engaged in the same pleasant meal.



Crack, crack went Suke's jaws every second or two.  By an

automatic chain of thought Grace's mind reverted to the tooth-

drawing scene described by her husband; and for the first time she

wondered if that narrative were really true, Susan's jaws being so

obviously sound and strong.  Grace turned up towards the nut-

gatherers, and conquered her reluctance to speak to the girl who

was a little in advance of Tim.  "Good-evening, Susan," she said.



"Good-evening, Miss Melbury" (crack).



"Mrs. Fitzpiers."



"Oh yes, ma'am--Mrs. Fitzpiers," said Suke, with a peculiar smile.



Grace, not to be daunted, continued: "Take care of your teeth,

Suke.  That accounts for the toothache."



"I don't know what an ache is, either in tooth, ear, or head,

thank the Lord" (crack).



"Nor the loss of one, either?"



"See for yourself, ma'am." She parted her red lips, and exhibited

the whole double row, full up and unimpaired.



"You have never had one drawn?"



"Never."



"So much the better for your stomach," said Mrs. Fitzpiers, in an

altered voice.  And turning away quickly, she went on.



As her husband's character thus shaped itself under the touch of

time, Grace was almost startled to find how little she suffered

from that jealous excitement which is conventionally attributed to

all wives in such circumstances.  But though possessed by none of

that feline wildness which it was her moral duty to experience,

she did not fail to know that she had made a frightful mistake in

her marriage.  Acquiescence in her father's wishes had been

degradation to herself.  People are not given premonitions for

nothing; she should have obeyed her impulse on that early morning,

and steadfastly refused her hand.



Oh, that plausible tale which her then betrothed had told her

about Suke--the dramatic account of her entreaties to him to draw

the aching enemy, and the fine artistic touch he had given to the

story by explaining that it was a lovely molar without a flaw!



She traced the remainder of the woodland track dazed by the

complications of her position.  If his protestations to her before

their marriage could be believed, her husband had felt affection

of some sort for herself and this woman simultaneously; and was

now again spreading the same emotion over Mrs. Charmond and

herself conjointly, his manner being still kind and fond at times. 

But surely, rather than that, he must have played the hypocrite

towards her in each case with elaborate completeness; and the

thought of this sickened her, for it involved the conjecture that

if he had not loved her, his only motive for making her his wife

must have been her little fortune.  Yet here Grace made a mistake,

for the love of men like Fitzpiers is unquestionably of such

quality as to bear division and transference.  He had indeed, once

declared, though not to her, that on one occasion he had noticed

himself to be possessed by five distinct infatuations at the same

time.  Therein it differed from the highest affection as the lower

orders of the animal world differ from advanced organisms,

partition causing, not death, but a multiplied existence.  He had

loved her sincerely, and had by no means ceased to love her now. 

But such double and treble barrelled hearts were naturally beyond

her conception.



Of poor Suke Damson, Grace thought no more.  She had had her day.



"If he does not love me I will not love him!" said Grace, proudly. 

And though these were mere words, it was a somewhat formidable

thing for Fitzpiers that her heart was approximating to a state in

which it might be possible to carry them out.  That very absence

of hot jealousy which made his courses so easy, and on which,

indeed, he congratulated himself, meant, unknown to either wife or

husband, more mischief than the inconvenient watchfulness of a

jaundiced eye.



Her sleep that night was nervous.  The wing allotted to her and

her husband had never seemed so lonely.  At last she got up, put

on her dressing-gown, and went down-stairs.  Her father, who slept

lightly, heard her descend, and came to the stair-head.



"Is that you, Grace? What's the matter?" he said.



"Nothing more than that I am restless.  Edgar is detained by a

case at Owlscombe in White Hart Vale."



"But how's that? I saw the woman's husband at Great Hintock just

afore bedtime; and she was going on well, and the doctor gone

then."



"Then he's detained somewhere else," said Grace.  "Never mind me;

he will soon be home.  I expect him about one."



She went back to her room, and dozed and woke several times.  One

o'clock had been the hour of his return on the last occasion; but

it passed now by a long way, and Fitzpiers did not come.  Just

before dawn she heard the men stirring in the yard; and the

flashes of their lanterns spread every now and then through her

window-blind.  She remembered that her father had told her not to

be disturbed if she noticed them, as they would be rising early to

send off four loads of hurdles to a distant sheep-fair.  Peeping

out, she saw them bustling about, the hollow-turner among the

rest; he was loading his wares--wooden-bowls, dishes, spigots,

spoons, cheese-vats, funnels, and so on--upon one of her father's

wagons, who carried them to the fair for him every year out of

neighborly kindness.



The scene and the occasion would have enlivened her but that her

husband was still absent; though it was now five o'clock.  She

could hardly suppose him, whatever his infatuation, to have

prolonged to a later hour than ten an ostensibly professional call

on Mrs. Charmond at Middleton; and he could have ridden home in

two hours and a half.  What, then, had become of him? That he had

been out the greater part of the two preceding nights added to her

uneasiness.



She dressed herself, descended, and went out, the weird twilight

of advancing day chilling the rays from the lanterns, and making

the men's faces wan.  As soon as Melbury saw her he came round,

showing his alarm.



"Edgar is not come," she said.  "And I have reason to know that

he's not attending anybody.  He has had no rest for two nights

before this.  I was going to the top of the hill to look for him."



"I'll come with you," said Melbury.



She begged him not to hinder himself; but he insisted, for he saw

a peculiar and rigid gloom in her face over and above her

uneasiness, and did not like the look of it.  Telling the men he

would be with them again soon, he walked beside her into the

turnpike-road, and partly up the hill whence she had watched

Fitzpiers the night before across the Great White Hart or

Blackmoor Valley.  They halted beneath a half-dead oak, hollow,

and disfigured with white tumors, its roots spreading out like

accipitrine claws grasping the ground.  A chilly wind circled

round them, upon whose currents the seeds of a neighboring lime-

tree, supported parachute-wise by the wing attached, flew out of

the boughs downward like fledglings from their nest.  The vale was

wrapped in a dim atmosphere of unnaturalness, and the east was

like a livid curtain edged with pink.  There was no sign nor sound

of Fitzpiers.



"It is no use standing here," said her father.  "He may come home

fifty ways...why, look here!--here be Darling's tracks--turned

homeward and nearly blown dry and hard! He must have come in hours

ago without your seeing him."



"He has not done that," said she.



They went back hastily.  On entering their own gates they

perceived that the men had left the wagons, and were standing

round the door of the stable which had been appropriated to the

doctor's use.  "Is there anything the matter?" cried Grace.



"Oh no, ma'am.  All's well that ends well," said old Timothy

Tangs.  "I've heard of such things before--among workfolk, though

not among your gentle people--that's true."



They entered the stable, and saw the pale shape of Darling

standing in the middle of her stall, with Fitzpiers on her back,

sound asleep.  Darling was munching hay as well as she could with

the bit in her month, and the reins, which had fallen from

Fitzpiers's hand, hung upon her neck.



Grace went and touched his hand; shook it before she could arouse

him.  He moved, started, opened his eyes, and exclaimed, "Ah,

Felice!...Oh, it's Grace.  I could not see in the gloom.  What--am

I in the saddle?"



"Yes," said she.  "How do you come here?"



He collected his thoughts, and in a few minutes stammered, "I was

riding along homeward through the vale, very, very sleepy, having

been up so much of late.  When I came opposite Holywell spring the

mare turned her head that way, as if she wanted to drink.  I let

her go in, and she drank; I thought she would never finish.  While

she was drinking, the clock of Owlscombe Church struck twelve.  I

distinctly remember counting the strokes.  From that moment I

positively recollect nothing till I saw you here by my side."



"The name! If it had been any other horse he'd have had a broken

neck!" murmured Melbury.



"'Tis wonderful, sure, how a quiet hoss will bring a man home at

such times!" said John Upjohn.  "And what's more wonderful than

keeping your seat in a deep, slumbering sleep?  I've knowed men

drowze off walking home from randies where the mead and other

liquors have gone round well, and keep walking for more than a

mile on end without waking.  Well, doctor, I don't care who the

man is, 'tis a mercy you wasn't a drownded, or a splintered, or a

hanged up to a tree like Absalom--also a handsome gentleman like

yerself, as the prophets say."



"True," murmured old Timothy.  "From the soul of his foot to the

crown of his head there was no blemish in him."



"Or leastwise you might ha' been a-wownded into tatters a'most,

and no doctor to jine your few limbs together within seven mile!"



While this grim address was proceeding, Fitzpiers had dismounted,

and taking Grace's arm walked stiffly in-doors with her.  Melbury

stood staring at the horse, which, in addition to being very

weary, was spattered with mud.  There was no mud to speak of about

the Hintocks just now--only in the clammy hollows of the vale

beyond Owlscombe, the stiff soil of which retained moisture for

weeks after the uplands were dry.  While they were rubbing down

the mare, Melbury's mind coupled with the foreign quality of the

mud the name he had heard unconsciously muttered by the surgeon

when Grace took his hand--"Felice."  Who was Felice? Why, Mrs.

Charmond; and she, as he knew, was staying at Middleton.



Melbury had indeed pounced upon the image that filled Fitzpiers's

half-awakened soul--wherein there had been a picture of a recent

interview on a lawn with a capriciously passionate woman who had

begged him not to come again in tones whose vibration incited him

to disobey.  "What are you doing here? Why do you pursue me?

Another belongs to you.  If they were to see you they would seize

you as a thief!" And she had turbulently admitted to his wringing

questions that her visit to Middleton had been undertaken less

because of the invalid relative than in shamefaced fear of her own

weakness if she remained near his home.  A triumph then it was to

Fitzpiers, poor and hampered as he had become, to recognize his

real conquest of this beauty, delayed so many years.  His was the

selfish passion of Congreve's Millamont, to whom love's supreme

delight lay in "that heart which others bleed for, bleed for me."



When the horse had been attended to Melbury stood uneasily here

and there about his premises; he was rudely disturbed in the

comfortable views which had lately possessed him on his domestic

concerns.  It is true that he had for some days discerned that

Grace more and more sought his company, preferred supervising his

kitchen and bakehouse with her step-mother to occupying herself

with the lighter details of her own apartments.  She seemed no

longer able to find in her own hearth an adequate focus for her

life, and hence, like a weak queen-bee after leading off to an

independent home, had hovered again into the parent hive.  But he

had not construed these and other incidents of the kind till now.



Something was wrong in the dove-cot.  A ghastly sense that he

alone would be responsible for whatever unhappiness should be

brought upon her for whom he almost solely lived, whom to retain

under his roof he had faced the numerous inconveniences involved

in giving up the best part of his house to Fitzpiers.  There was

no room for doubt that, had he allowed events to take their

natural course, she would have accepted Winterborne, and realized

his old dream of restitution to that young man's family.



That Fitzpiers could allow himself to look on any other creature

for a moment than Grace filled Melbury with grief and

astonishment.  In the pure and simple life he had led it had

scarcely occurred to him that after marriage a man might be

faithless.  That he could sweep to the heights of Mrs. Charmond's

position, lift the veil of Isis, so to speak, would have amazed

Melbury by its audacity if he had not suspected encouragement from

that quarter.  What could he and his simple Grace do to

countervail the passions of such as those two sophisticated

beings--versed in the world's ways, armed with every apparatus for

victory?  In such an encounter the homely timber-dealer felt as

inferior as a bow-and-arrow savage before the precise weapons of

modern warfare.



Grace came out of the house as the morning drew on.  The village

was silent, most of the folk having gone to the fair.  Fitzpiers

had retired to bed, and was sleeping off his fatigue.  She went to

the stable and looked at poor Darling: in all probability Giles

Winterborne, by obtaining for her a horse of such intelligence and

docility, had been the means of saving her husband's life.  She

paused over the strange thought; and then there appeared her

father behind her.  She saw that he knew things were not as they

ought to be, from the troubled dulness of his eye, and from his

face, different points of which had independent motions,

twitchings, and tremblings, unknown to himself, and involuntary.



"He was detained, I suppose, last night?" said Melbury.



"Oh yes; a bad case in the vale," she replied, calmly.



"Nevertheless, he should have stayed at home."



"But he couldn't, father."



Her father turned away.  He could hardly bear to see his whilom

truthful girl brought to the humiliation of having to talk like

that.



That night carking care sat beside Melbury's pillow, and his stiff

limbs tossed at its presence.  "I can't lie here any longer," he

muttered.  Striking a light, he wandered about the room.  "What

have I done--what have I done for her?" he said to his wife, who

had anxiously awakened.  "I had long planned that she should marry

the son of the man I wanted to make amends to; do ye mind how I

told you all about it, Lucy, the night before she came home? Ah!

but I was not content with doing right, I wanted to do more!"



"Don't raft yourself without good need, George," she replied.  "I

won't quite believe that things are so much amiss.  I won't

believe that Mrs. Charmond has encouraged him.  Even supposing she

has encouraged a great many, she can have no motive to do it now. 

What so likely as that she is not yet quite well, and doesn't care

to let another doctor come near her?"



He did not heed.  "Grace used to be so busy every day, with fixing

a curtain here and driving a tin-tack there; but she cares for no

employment now!"



"Do you know anything of Mrs. Charmond's past history? Perhaps

that would throw some light upon things.  Pefore she came here as

the wife of old Charmond four or five years ago, not a soul seems

to have heard aught of her.  Why not make inquiries? And then do

ye wait and see more; there'll be plenty of opportnnity.  Time

enough to cry when you know 'tis a crying matter; and 'tis bad to

meet troubles half-way."



There was some good-sense in the notion of seeing further. 

Melbury resolved to inquire and wait, hoping still, hut oppressed

between-whiles with much fear.
