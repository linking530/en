The chief hotel at Sherton-Abbas was an old stone-fronted inn with

a yawning arch, under which vehicles were driven by stooping

coachmen to back premises of wonderful commodiousness.  The

windows to the street were mullioned into narrow lights, and only

commanded a view of the opposite houses; hence, perhaps, it arose

that the best and most luxurious private sitting-room that the inn

could afford over-looked the nether parts of the establishment,

where beyond the yard were to be seen gardens and orchards, now

bossed, nay incrusted, with scarlet and gold fruit, stretching to

infinite distance under a luminous lavender mist.  The time was

early autumn,





    "When the fair apples, red as evening sky,

    Do bend the tree unto the fruitful ground,

     When juicy pears, and berries of black dye,

    Do dance in air, and call the eyes around."





The landscape confronting the window might, indeed, have been part

of the identical stretch of country which the youthful Chatterton

had in his mind.



In this room sat she who had been the maiden Grace Melbury till

the finger of fate touched her and turned her to a wife.  It was

two months after the wedding, and she was alone.  Fitzpiers had

walked out to see the abbey by the light of sunset, but she had

been too fatigued to accompany him.  They had reached the last

stage of a long eight-weeks' tour, and were going on to Hintock

that night.



In the yard, between Grace and the orchards, there progressed a

scene natural to the locality at this time of the year.  An apple-

mill and press had been erected on the spot, to which some men

were bringing fruit from divers points in mawn-baskets, while

others were grinding them, and others wringing down the pomace,

whose sweet juice gushed forth into tubs and pails.  The

superintendent of these proceedings, to whom the others spoke as

master, was a young yeoman of prepossessing manner and aspect,

whose form she recognized in a moment.  He had hung his coat to a

nail of the out-house wall, and wore his shirt-sleeves rolled up

beyond his elbows, to keep them unstained while he rammed the

pomace into the bags of horse-hair.  Fragments of apple-rind had

alighted upon the brim of his hat--probably from the bursting of a

bag--while brown pips of the same fruit were sticking among the

down upon his fine, round arms.



She realized in a moment how he had come there.  Down in the heart

of the apple country nearly every farmer kept up a cider-making

apparatus and wring-house for his own use, building up the pomace

in great straw "cheeses," as they were called; but here, on the

margin of Pomona's plain, was a debatable land neither orchard nor

sylvan exclusively, where the apple produce was hardly sufficient

to warrant each proprietor in keeping a mill of his own.  This was

the field of the travelling cider-maker.  His press and mill were

fixed to wheels instead of being set up in a cider-house; and with

a couple of horses, buckets, tubs, strainers, and an assistant or

two, he wandered from place to place, deriving very satisfactory

returns for his trouble in such a prolific season as the present.



The back parts of the town were just now abounding with apple-

gatherings.  They stood in the yards in carts, baskets, and loose

heaps; and the blue.  stagnant air of autumn which hung over

everything was heavy with a sweet cidery smell.  Cakes of pomace

lay against the walls in the yellow sun, where they were drying to

be used as fuel.  Yet it was not the great make of the year as

yet; before the standard crop came in there accumulated, in

abundant times like this, a large superfluity of early apples, and

windfalls from the trees of later harvest, which would not keep

long.  Thus, in the baskets, and quivering in the hopper of the

mill, she saw specimens of mixed dates, including the mellow

countenances of streaked-jacks, codlins, costards, stubbards,

ratheripes, and other well-known friends of her ravenous youth.



Grace watched the head-man with interest.  The slightest sigh

escaped her.  Perhaps she thought of the day--not so far distant--

when that friend of her childhood had met her by her father's

arrangement in this same town, warm with hope, though diffident,

and trusting in a promise rather implied than given.  Or she might

have thought of days earlier yet--days of childhood--when her

mouth was somewhat more ready to receive a kiss from his than was

his to bestow one.  However, all that was over.  She had felt

superior to him then, and she felt superior to him now.



She wondered why he never looked towards her open window.  She did

not know that in the slight commotion caused by their arrival at

the inn that afternoon Winterborne had caught sight of her through

the archway, had turned red, and was continuing his work with more

concentrated attention on the very account of his discovery.

Robert Creedle, too, who travelled with Giles, had been

incidentally informed by the hostler that Dr. Fitzpiers and his

young wife were in the hotel, after which news Creedle kept

shaking his head and saying to himself, "Ah!" very audibly,

between his thrusts at the screw of the cider-press.



"Why the deuce do you sigh like that, Robert?" asked Winterborne,

at last.



"Ah, maister--'tis my thoughts--'tis my thoughts!...Yes, ye've

lost a hundred load o' timber well seasoned; ye've lost five

hundred pound in good money; ye've lost the stone-windered house

that's big enough to hold a dozen families; ye've lost your share

of half a dozen good wagons and their horses--all lost!--through

your letting slip she that was once yer own!"



"Good God, Creedle, you'll drive me mad!" said Giles, sternly. 

"Don't speak of that any more!"



Thus the subject had ended in the yard.  Meanwhile, the passive

cause of all this loss still regarded the scene.  She was

beautifully dressed; she was seated in the most comfortable room

that the inn afforded; her long journey had been full of variety,

and almost luxuriously performed--for Fitzpiers did not study

economy where pleasure was in question.  Hence it perhaps arose

that Giles and all his belongings seemed sorry and common to her

for the moment--moving in a plane so far removed from her own of

late that she could scarcely believe she had ever found congruity

therein.  "No--I could never have married him!" she said, gently

shaking her head.  "Dear father was right.  It would have been too

coarse a life for me." And she looked at the rings of sapphire and

opal upon her white and slender fingers that had been gifts from

Fitzpiers.



Seeing that Giles still kept his back turned, and with a little of

the above-described pride of life--easily to be understood, and

possibly excused, in a young, inexperienced woman who thought she

had married well--she said at last, with a smile on her lips, "Mr.

Winterborne!"



He appeared to take no heed, and she said a second time, "Mr.

Winterborne!"



Even now he seemed not to hear, though a person close enough to

him to see the expression of his face might have doubted it; and

she said a third time, with a timid loudness, "Mr. Winterborne!

What, have you forgotten my voice?" She remained with her lips

parted in a welcoming smile.



He turned without surprise, and came deliberately towards the

window.  "Why do you call me?" he said, with a sternness that took

her completely unawares, his face being now pale.  "Is it not

enough that you see me here moiling and muddling for my daily

bread while you are sitting there in your success, that you can't

refrain from opening old wounds by calling out my name?"



She flushed, and was struck dumb for some moments; but she forgave

his unreasoning anger, knowing so well in what it had its root. 

"I am sorry I offended you by speaking," she replied, meekly. 

"Believe me, I did not intend to do that.  I could hardly sit here

so near you without a word of recognition."



Winterborne's heart had swollen big, and his eyes grown moist by

this time, so much had the gentle answer of that familiar voice

moved him.  He assured her hurriedly, and without looking at her,

that he was not angry.  He then managed to ask her, in a clumsy,

constrained way, if she had had a pleasant journey, and seen many

interesting sights.  She spoke of a few places that she had

visited, and so the time passed till he withdrew to take his place

at one of the levers which pulled round the screw.



Forgotten her voice! Indeed, he had not forgotten her voice, as

his bitterness showed.  But though in the heat of the moment he

had reproached her keenly, his second mood was a far more tender

one--that which could regard her renunciation of such as he as her

glory and her privilege, his own fidelity notwithstanding.  He

could have declared with a contemporary poet--





           "If I forget,

   The salt creek may forget the ocean;

            If I forget

   The heart whence flows my heart's bright motion,

   May I sink meanlier than the worst

   Abandoned, outcast, crushed, accurst,

            If I forget.



            "Though you forget,

   No word of mine shall mar your pleasure;

            Though you forget,

   You filled my barren life with treasure,

   You may withdraw the gift you gave;

   You still are queen, I still am slave,

            Though you forget."





She had tears in her eyes at the thought that she could not remind

him of what he ought to have remembered; that not herself but the

pressure of events had dissipated the dreams of their early youth. 

Grace was thus unexpectedly worsted in her encounter with her old

friend.  She had opened the window with a faint sense of triumph,

but he had turned it into sadness; she did not quite comprehend

the reason why.  In truth it was because she was not cruel enough

in her cruelty.  If you have to use the knife, use it, say the

great surgeons; and for her own peace Grace should have contemned

Winterborne thoroughly or not at all.  As it was, on closing the

window an indescribable, some might have said dangerous, pity

quavered in her bosom for him.



Presently her husband entered the room, and told her what a

wonderful sunset there was to be seen.



"I have not noticed it.  But I have seen somebody out there that

we know," she replied, looking into the court.



Fitzpiers followed the direction of her eyes, and said he did not

recognize anybody.



"Why, Mr. Winterborne--there he is, cider-making.  He combines

that with his other business, you know."



"Oh--that fellow," said Fitzpiers, his curiosity becoming extinct.



She, reproachfully: "What, call Mr. Winterborne a fellow, Edgar?

It is true I was just saying to myself that I never could have

married him; but I have much regard for him, and always shall."



"Well, do by all means, my dear one.  I dare say I am inhuman, and

supercilious, and contemptibly proud of my poor old ramshackle

family; but I do honestly confess to you that I feel as if I

belonged to a different species from the people who are working in

that yard."



"And from me too, then.  For my blood is no better than theirs."



He looked at her with a droll sort of awakening.  It was, indeed,

a startling anomaly that this woman of the tribe without should be

standing there beside him as his wife, if his sentiments were as

he had said.  In their travels together she had ranged so

unerringly at his level in ideas, tastes, and habits that he had

almost forgotten how his heart had played havoc with his

principles in taking her to him.



"Ah YOU--you are refined and educated into something quite

different," he said, self-assuringly.



"I don't quite like to think that," she murmured with soft regret. 

"And I think you underestimate Giles Winterborne.  Remember, I was

brought up with him till I was sent away to school, so I cannot be

radically different.  At any rate, I don't feel so.  That is, no

doubt, my fault, and a great blemish in me.  But I hope you will

put up with it, Edgar."



Fitzpiers said that he would endeavor to do so; and as it was now

getting on for dusk, they prepared to perform the last stage of

their journey, so as to arrive at Hintock before it grew very

late.



In less than half an hour they started, the cider-makers in the

yard having ceased their labors and gone away, so that the only

sounds audible there now were the trickling of the juice from the

tightly screwed press, and the buzz of a single wasp, which had

drunk itself so tipsy that it was unconscious of nightfall.  Grace

was very cheerful at the thought of being soon in her sylvan home,

but Fitzpiers sat beside her almost silent.  An indescribable

oppressiveness had overtaken him with the near approach of the

journey's end and the realities of life that lay there.



"You don't say a word, Edgar," she observed.  "Aren't you glad to

get back? I am."



"You have friends here.  I have none."



"But my friends are yours."



"Oh yes--in that sense."



The conversation languished, and they drew near the end of Hintock

Lane.  It had been decided that they should, at least for a time,

take up their abode in her father's roomy house, one wing of which

was quite at their service, being almost disused by the Melburys. 

Workmen had been painting, papering, and whitewashing this set of

rooms in the wedded pair's absence; and so scrupulous had been the

timber-dealer that there should occur no hitch or disappointment

on their arrival, that not the smallest detail remained undone. 

To make it all complete a ground-floor room had been fitted up as

a surgery, with an independent outer door, to which Fitzpiers's

brass plate was screwed--for mere ornament, such a sign being

quite superfluous where everybody knew the latitude and longitude

of his neighbors for miles round.



Melbury and his wife welcomed the twain with affection, and all

the house with deference.  They went up to explore their rooms,

that opened from a passage on the left hand of the staircase, the

entrance to which could be shut off on the landing by a door that

Melbury had hung for the purpose.  A friendly fire was burning in

the grate, although it was not cold.  Fitzpiers said it was too

soon for any sort of meal, they only having dined shortly before

leaving Sherton-Abbas.  He would walk across to his old lodging,

to learn how his locum tenens had got on in his absence.



In leaving Melbury's door he looked back at the house.  There was

economy in living under that roof, and economy was desirable, but

in some way he was dissatisfied with the arrangement; it immersed

him so deeply in son-in-lawship to Melbury.  He went on to his

former residence.  His deputy was out, and Fitzpiers fell into

conversation with his former landlady.



"Well, Mrs. Cox, what's the best news?" he asked of her, with

cheery weariness.



She was a little soured at losing by his marriage so profitable a

tenant as the surgeon had proved to be duling his residence under

her roof; and the more so in there being hardly the remotest

chance of her getting such another settler in the Hintock

solitudes.  "'Tis what I don't wish to repeat, sir; least of all

to you," she mumbled.



"Never mind me, Mrs. Cox; go ahead."



"It is what people say about your hasty marrying, Dr. Fitzpiers. 

Whereas they won't believe you know such clever doctrines in

physic as they once supposed of ye, seeing as you could marry into

Mr. Melbury's family, which is only Hintock-born, such as me."



"They are kindly welcome to their opinion," said Fitzpiers, not

allowing himself to recognize that he winced.  "Anything else?"



"Yes; SHE'S come home at last."



"Who's she?"



"Mrs. Charmond."



"Oh, indeed!" said Fitzpiers, with but slight interest.  "I've

never seen her."



"She has seen you, sir, whether or no."



"Never."



"Yes; she saw you in some hotel or street for a minute or two

while you were away travelling, and accidentally heard your name;

and when she made some remark about you, Miss Ellis--that's her

maid--told her you was on your wedding-tower with Mr. Melbury's

daughter; and she said, 'He ought to have done better than that. 

I fear he has spoiled his chances,' she says."



Fitzpiers did not talk much longer to this cheering housewife, and

walked home with no very brisk step.  He entered the door quietly,

and went straight up-stairs to the drawing-room extemporized for

their use by Melbury in his and his bride's absence, expecting to

find her there as he had left her.  The fire was burning still,

but there were no lights.  He looked into the next apartment,

fitted up as a little dining-room, but no supper was laid.  He

went to the top of the stairs, and heard a chorus of voices in the

timber-merchant's parlor below, Grace's being occasionally

intermingled.



Descending, and looking into the room from the door-way, he found

quite a large gathering of neighbors and other acquaintances,

praising and congratulating Mrs. Fitzpiers on her return, among

them being the dairyman, Farmer Bawtree, and the master-blacksmith

from Great Hintock; also the cooper, the hollow-turner, the

exciseman, and some others, with their wives, who lived hard by. 

Grace, girl that she was, had quite forgotten her new dignity and

her husband's; she was in the midst of them, blushing, and

receiving their compliments with all the pleasure of old-

comradeship.



Fitzpiers experienced a profound distaste for the situation. 

Melbury was nowhere in the room, but Melbury's wife, perceiving

the doctor, came to him.  "We thought, Grace and I," she said,

"that as they have called, hearing you were come, we could do no

less than ask them to supper; and then Grace proposed that we

should all sup together, as it is the first night of your return."



By this time Grace had come round to him.  "Is it not good of them

to welcome me so warmly?" she exclaimed, with tears of friendship

in her eyes.  "After so much good feeling I could not think of our

shutting ourselves up away from them in our own dining-room."



"Certainly not--certainly not," said Fitzpiers; and he entered the

room with the heroic smile of a martyr.



As soon as they sat down to table Melbury came in, and seemed to

see at once that Fitzpiers would much rather have received no such

demonstrative reception.  He thereupon privately chid his wife for

her forwardness in the matter.  Mrs. Melbury declared that it was

as much Grace's doing as hers, after which there was no more to be

said by that young woman's tender father.  By this time Fitzpiers

was making the best of his position among the wide-elbowed and

genial company who sat eating and drinking and laughing and joking

around him; and getting warmed himself by the good cheer, was

obliged to admit that, after all, the supper was not the least

enjoyable he had ever known.



At times, however, the words about his having spoiled his

opportunities, repeated to him as those of Mrs. Charmond, haunted

him like a handwriting on the wall.  Then his manner would become

suddenly abstracted.  At one moment he would mentally put an

indignant query why Mrs. Charmond or any other woman should make

it her business to have opinions about his opportunities; at

another he thought that he could hardly be angry with her for

taking an interest in the doctor of her own parish.  Then he would

drink a glass of grog and so get rid of the misgiving.  These

hitches and quaffings were soon perceived by Grace as well as by

her father; and hence both of them were much relieved when the

first of the guests to discover that the hour was growing late

rose and declared that he must think of moving homeward. At the

words Melbury rose as alertly as if lifted by a spring, and in ten

minutes they were gone.



"Now, Grace," said her husband as soon as he found himself alone

with her in their private apartments, "we've had a very pleasant

evening, and everybody has been very kind.  But we must come to an

understanding about our way of living here.  If we continue in

these rooms there must be no mixing in with your people below.  I

can't stand it, and that's the truth."



She had been sadly surprised at the suddenness of his distaste for

those old-fashioned woodland forms of life which in his courtship

he had professed to regard with so much interest.  But she

assented in a moment.



"We must be simply your father's tenants," he continued, "and our

goings and comings must be as independent as if we lived

elsewhere."



"Certainly, Edgar--I quite see that it must be so."



"But you joined in with all those people in my absence, without

knowing whether I should approve or disapprove.  When I came I

couldn't help myself at all."



She, sighing: "Yes--I see I ought to have waited; though they came

unexpectedly, and I thought I had acted for the best."



Thus the discussion ended, and the next day Fitzpiers went on his

old rounds as usual.  But it was easy for so super-subtle an eye

as his to discern, or to think he discerned, that he was no longer

regarded as an extrinsic, unfathomed gentleman of limitless

potentiality, scientific and social; but as Mr. Melbury's compeer,

and therefore in a degree only one of themselves.  The Hintock

woodlandlers held with all the strength of inherited conviction to

the aristocratic principle, and as soon as they had discovered

that Fitzpiers was one of the old Buckbury Fitzpierses they had

accorded to him for nothing a touching of hat-brims, promptness of

service, and deference of approach, which Melbury had to do

without, though he paid for it over and over.  But now, having

proved a traitor to his own cause by this marriage, Fitzpiers was

believed in no more as a superior hedged by his own divinity;

while as doctor he began to be rated no higher than old Jones,

whom they had so long despised.



His few patients seemed in his two months' absence to have

dwindled considerably in number, and no sooner had he returned

than there came to him from the Board of Guardians a complaint

that a pauper had been neglected by his substitute.  In a fit of

pride Fitzpiers resigned his appointment as one of the surgeons to

the union, which had been the nucleus of his practice here.



At the end of a fortnight he came in-doors one evening to Grace

more briskly than usual.  "They have written to me again about

that practice in Budmouth that I once negotiated for," he said to

her.  "The premium asked is eight hundred pounds, and I think that

between your father and myself it ought to be raised.  Then we can

get away from this place forever."



The question had been mooted between them before, and she was not

unprepared to consider it.  They had not proceeded far with the

discussion when a knock came to the door, and in a minute Grammer

ran up to say that a message had arrived from Hintock House

requesting Dr. Fitzpiers to attend there at once.  Mrs. Charmond

had met with a slight accident through the overturning of her

carriage.



"This is something, anyhow," said Fitzpiers, rising with an

interest which he could not have defined.  "I have had a

presentiment that this mysterious woman and I were to be better

acquainted."



The latter words were murmured to himself alone.



"Good-night," said Grace, as soon as he was ready.  "I shall be

asleep, probably, when you return."



"Good-night, "he replied, inattentively, and went down-stairs.  It

was the first time since their marriage that he had left her

without a kiss.
