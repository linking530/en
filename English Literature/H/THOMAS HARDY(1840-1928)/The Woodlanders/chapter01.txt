CHAPTER I.





The rambler who, for old association or other reasons, should

trace the forsaken coach-road running almost in a meridional line

from Bristol to the south shore of England, would find himself

during the latter half of his journey in the vicinity of some

extensive woodlands, interspersed with apple-orchards.  Here the

trees, timber or fruit-bearing, as the case may be, make the way-

side hedges ragged by their drip and shade, stretching over the

road with easeful horizontality, as if they found the

unsubstantial air an adequate support for their limbs.  At one

place, where a hill is crossed, the largest of the woods shows

itself bisected by the high-way, as the head of thick hair is

bisected by the white line of its parting.  The spot is lonely.



The physiognomy of a deserted highway expresses solitude to a

degree that is not reached by mere dales or downs, and bespeaks a

tomb-like stillness more emphatic than that of glades and pools. 

The contrast of what is with what might be probably accounts for

this.  To step, for instance, at the place under notice, from the

hedge of the plantation into the adjoining pale thoroughfare, and

pause amid its emptiness for a moment, was to exchange by the act

of a single stride the simple absence of human companionship for

an incubus of the forlorn.



At this spot, on the lowering evening of a by-gone winter's day,

there stood a man who had entered upon the scene much in the

aforesaid manner.  Alighting into the road from a stile hard by,

he, though by no means a "chosen vessel" for impressions, was

temporarily influenced by some such feeling of being suddenly more

alone than before he had emerged upon the highway.



It could be seen by a glance at his rather finical style of dress

that he did not belong to the country proper; and from his air,

after a while, that though there might be a sombre beauty in the

scenery, music in the breeze, and a wan procession of coaching

ghosts in the sentiment of this old turnpike-road, he was mainly

puzzled about the way.  The dead men's work that had been expended

in climbing that hill, the blistered soles that had trodden it,

and the tears that had wetted it, were not his concern; for fate

had given him no time for any but practical things.



He looked north and south, and mechanically prodded the ground

with his walking-stick.  A closer glance at his face corroborated

the testimony of his clothes.  It was self-complacent, yet there

was small apparent ground for such complacence.  Nothing

irradiated it; to the eye of the magician in character, if not to

the ordinary observer, the expression enthroned there was absolute

submission to and belief in a little assortment of forms and

habitudes.



At first not a soul appeared who could enlighten him as he

desired, or seemed likely to appear that night.  But presently a

slight noise of laboring wheels and the steady dig of a horse's

shoe-tips became audible; and there loomed in the notch of the

hill and plantation that the road formed here at the summit a

carrier's van drawn by a single horse.  When it got nearer, he

said, with some relief to himself, "'Tis Mrs. Dollery's--this will

help me."



The vehicle was half full of passengers, mostly women.  He held up

his stick at its approach, and the woman who was driving drew

rein.



"I've been trying to find a short way to Little Hintock this last

half-hour, Mrs. Dollery," he said.  "But though I've been to Great

Hintock and Hintock House half a dozen times I am at fault about

the small village.  You can help me, I dare say?"



She assured him that she could--that as she went to Great Hintock

her van passed near it--that it was only up the lane that branched

out of the lane into which she was about to turn--just ahead. 

"Though," continued Mrs. Dollery, "'tis such a little small place

that, as a town gentleman, you'd need have a candle and lantern to

find it if ye don't know where 'tis.  Bedad! I wouldn't live there

if they'd pay me to.  Now at Great Hintock you do see the world a

bit."



He mounted and sat beside her, with his feet outside, where they

were ever and anon brushed over by the horse's tail.



This van, driven and owned by Mrs. Dollery, was rather a movable

attachment of the roadway than an extraneous object, to those who

knew it well.  The old horse, whose hair was of the roughness and

color of heather, whose leg-joints, shoulders, and hoofs were

distorted by harness and drudgery from colthood--though if all had

their rights, he ought, symmetrical in outline, to have been

picking the herbage of some Eastern plain instead of tugging here--

had trodden this road almost daily for twenty years.  Even his

subjection was not made congruous throughout, for the harness

being too short, his tail was not drawn through the crupper, so

that the breeching slipped awkwardly to one side.  He knew every

subtle incline of the seven or eight miles of ground between

Hintock and Sherton Abbas--the market-town to which he journeyed--

as accurately as any surveyor could have learned it by a Dumpy

level.



The vehicle had a square black tilt which nodded with the motion

of the wheels, and at a point in it over the driver's head was a

hook to which the reins were hitched at times, when they formed a

catenary curve from the horse's shoulders.  Somewhere about the

axles was a loose chain, whose only known purpose was to clink as

it went.  Mrs. Dollery, having to hop up and down many times in

the service of her passengers, wore, especially in windy weather,

short leggings under her gown for modesty's sake, and instead of a

bonnet a felt hat tied down with a handkerchief, to guard against

an earache to which she was frequently subject.  In the rear of

the van was a glass window, which she cleaned with her pocket-

handkerchief every market-day before starting.  Looking at the van

from the back, the spectator could thus see through its interior a

square piece of the same sky and landscape that he saw without,

but intruded on by the profiles of the seated passengers, who, as

they rumbled onward, their lips moving and heads nodding in

animated private converse, remained in happy unconsciousness that

their mannerisms and facial peculiarities were sharply defined to

the public eye.



This hour of coming home from market was the happy one, if not the

happiest, of the week for them.  Snugly ensconced under the tilt,

they could forget the sorrows of the world without, and survey

life and recapitulate the incidents of the day with placid smiles.



The passengers in the back part formed a group to themselves, and

while the new-comer spoke to the proprietress, they indulged in a

confidential chat about him as about other people, which the noise

of the van rendered inaudible to himself and Mrs. Dollery, sitting

forward.



"'Tis Barber Percombe--he that's got the waxen woman in his window

at the top of Abbey Street," said one.  "What business can bring

him from his shop out here at this time and not a journeyman hair-

cutter, but a master-barber that's left off his pole because 'tis

not genteel!"



They listened to his conversation, but Mr. Percombe, though he had

nodded and spoken genially, seemed indisposed to gratify the

curiosity which he had aroused; and the unrestrained flow of ideas

which had animated the inside of the van before his arrival was

checked thenceforward.



Thus they rode on till they turned into a half-invisible little

lane, whence, as it reached the verge of an eminence, could be

discerned in the dusk, about half a mile to the right, gardens and

orchards sunk in a concave, and, as it were, snipped out of the

woodland.  From this self-contained place rose in stealthy silence

tall stems of smoke, which the eye of imagination could trace

downward to their root on quiet hearth-stones festooned overhead

with hams and flitches.  It was one of those sequestered spots

outside the gates of the world where may usually be found more

meditation than action, and more passivity than meditation; where

reasoning proceeds on narrow premises, and results in inferences

wildly imaginative; yet where, from time to time, no less than in

other places, dramas of a grandeur and unity truly Sophoclean are

enacted in the real, by virtue of the concentrated passions and

closely knit interdependence of the lives therein.



This place was the Little Hintock of the master-barber's search. 

The coming night gradually obscured the smoke of the chimneys, but

the position of the sequestered little world could still be

distinguished by a few faint lights, winking more or less

ineffectually through the leafless boughs, and the undiscerned

songsters they bore, in the form of balls of feathers, at roost

among them.



Out of the lane followed by the van branched a yet smaller lane,

at the corner of which the barber alighted, Mrs. Dollery's van

going on to the larger village, whose superiority to the despised

smaller one as an exemplar of the world's movements was not

particularly apparent in its means of approach.



"A very clever and learned young doctor, who, they say, is in

league with the devil, lives in the place you be going to--not

because there's anybody for'n to cure there, but because 'tis the

middle of his district."



The observation was flung at the barber by one of the women at

parting, as a last attempt to get at his errand that way.



But he made no reply, and without further pause the pedestrian

plunged towards the umbrageous nook, and paced cautiously over the

dead leaves which nearly buried the road or street of the hamlet. 

As very few people except themselves passed this way after dark, a

majority of the denizens of Little Hintock deemed window-curtains

unnecessary; and on this account Mr. Percombe made it his business

to stop opposite the casements of each cottage that he came to,

with a demeanor which showed that he was endeavoring to

conjecture, from the persons and things he observed within, the

whereabouts of somebody or other who resided here.



Only the smaller dwellings interested him; one or two houses,

whose size, antiquity, and rambling appurtenances signified that

notwithstanding their remoteness they must formerly have been, if

they were not still, inhabited by people of a certain social

standing, being neglected by him entirely.  Smells of pomace, and

the hiss of fermenting cider, which reached him from the back

quarters of other tenements, revealed the recent occupation of

some of the inhabitants, and joined with the scent of decay from

the perishing leaves underfoot.



Half a dozen dwellings were passed without result.  The next,

which stood opposite a tall tree, was in an exceptional state of

radiance, the flickering brightness from the inside shining up the

chimney and making a luminous mist of the emerging smoke.  The

interior, as seen through the window, caused him to draw up with a

terminative air and watch.  The house was rather large for a

cottage, and the door, which opened immediately into the living-

room, stood ajar, so that a ribbon of light fell through the

opening into the dark atmosphere without.  Every now and then a

moth, decrepit from the late season, would flit for a moment

across the out-coming rays and disappear again into the night.
