Kaleidoscopic dreams of a weird alchemist-surgeon, Grammer

Oliver's skeleton, and the face of Giles Winterborne, brought

Grace Melbury to the morning of the next day.  It was fine.  A

north wind was blowing--that not unacceptable compromise between

the atmospheric cutlery of the eastern blast and the spongy gales

of the west quarter.  She looked from her window in the direction

of the light of the previous evening, and could just discern

through the trees the shape of the surgeon's house.  Somehow, in

the broad, practical daylight, that unknown and lonely gentleman

seemed to be shorn of much of the interest which had invested his

personality and pursuits in the hours of darkness, and as Grace's

dressing proceeded he faded from her mind.



Meanwhile, Winterborne, though half assured of her father's favor,

was rendered a little restless by Miss Melbury's behavior. 

Despite his dry self-control, he could not help looking

continually from his own door towards the timber-merchant's, in

the probability of somebody's emergence therefrom.  His attention

was at length justified by the appearance of two figures, that of

Mr. Melbury himself, and Grace beside him.  They stepped out in a

direction towards the densest quarter of the wood, and Winterborne

walked contemplatively behind them, till all three were soon under

the trees.



Although the time of bare boughs had now set in, there were

sheltered hollows amid the Hintock plantations and copses in which

a more tardy leave-taking than on windy summits was the rule with

the foliage.  This caused here and there an apparent mixture of

the seasons; so that in some of the dells that they passed by

holly-berries in full red were found growing beside oak and hazel

whose leaves were as yet not far removed from green, and brambles

whose verdure was rich and deep as in the month of August.  To

Grace these well-known peculiarities were as an old painting

restored.



Now could be beheld that change from the handsome to the curious

which the features of a wood undergo at the ingress of the winter

months.  Angles were taking the place of curves, and reticulations

of surfaces--a change constituting a sudden lapse from the ornate

to the primitive on Nature's canvas, and comparable to a

retrogressive step from the art of an advanced school of painting

to that of the Pacific Islander.



Winterborne followed, and kept his eye upon the two figures as

they threaded their way through these sylvan phenomena.  Mr.

Melbury's long legs, and gaiters drawn in to the bone at the

ankles, his slight stoop, his habit of getting lost in thought and

arousing himself with an exclamation of "Hah!" accompanied with an

upward jerk of the head, composed a personage recognizable by his

neighbors as far as he could be seen.  It seemed as if the

squirrels and birds knew him.  One of the former would

occasionally run from the path to hide behind the arm of some

tree, which the little animal carefully edged round pari passu

with Melbury and his daughters movement onward, assuming a mock

manner, as though he were saying, "Ho, ho; you are only a timber-

merchant, and carry no gun!"



They went noiselessly over mats of starry moss, rustled through

interspersed tracts of leaves, skirted trunks with spreading

roots, whose mossed rinds made them like hands wearing green

gloves; elbowed old elms and ashes with great forks, in which

stood pools of water that overflowed on rainy days, and ran down

their stems in green cascades.  On older trees still than these,

huge lobes of fungi grew like lungs.  Here, as everywhere, the

Unfulfilled Intention, which makes life what it is, was as obvious

as it could be among the depraved crowds of a city slum.  The leaf

was deformed, the curve was crippled, the taper was interrupted;

the lichen eat the vigor of the stalk, and the ivy slowly

strangled to death the promising sapling.



They dived amid beeches under which nothing grew, the younger

boughs still retaining their hectic leaves, that rustled in the

breeze with a sound almost metallic, like the sheet-iron foliage

of the fabled Jarnvid wood.  Some flecks of white in Grace's

drapery had enabled Giles to keep her and her father in view till

this time; but now he lost sight of them, and was obliged to

follow by ear--no difficult matter, for on the line of their

course every wood-pigeon rose from its perch with a continued

clash, dashing its wings against the branches with wellnigh force

enough to break every quill.  By taking the track of this noise he

soon came to a stile.



Was it worth while to go farther? He examined the doughy soil at

the foot of the stile, and saw among the large sole-and-heel

tracks an impression of a slighter kind from a boot that was

obviously not local, for Winterborne knew all the cobblers'

patterns in that district, because they were very few to know. 

The mud-picture was enough to make him swing himself over and

proceed.



The character of the woodland now changed.  The bases of the

smaller trees were nibbled bare by rabbits, and at divers points

heaps of fresh-made chips, and the newly-cut stool of a tree,

stared white through the undergrowth.  There had been a large fall

of timber this year, which explained the meaning of some sounds

that soon reached him.



A voice was shouting intermittently in a sort of human bark, which

reminded Giles that there was a sale of trees and fagots that very

day.  Melbury would naturally be present.  Thereupon Winterborne

remembered that he himself wanted a few fagots, and entered upon

the scene.



A large group of buyers stood round the auctioneer, or followed

him when, between his pauses, he wandered on from one lot of

plantation produce to another, like some philosopher of the

Peripatetic school delivering his lectures in the shady groves of

the Lyceum.  His companions were timber-dealers, yeomen, farmers,

villagers, and others; mostly woodland men, who on that account

could afford to be curious in their walking-sticks, which

consequently exhibited various monstrosities of vegetation, the

chief being cork-screw shapes in black and white thorn, brought to

that pattern by the slow torture of an encircling woodbine during

their growth, as the Chinese have been said to mould human beings

into grotesque toys by continued compression in infancy.  Two

women, wearing men's jackets on their gowns, conducted in the rear

of the halting procession a pony-cart containing a tapped barrel

of beer, from which they drew and replenished horns that were

handed round, with bread-and-cheese from a basket.



The auctioneer adjusted himself to circumstances by using his

walking-stick as a hammer, and knocked down the lot on any

convenient object that took his fancy, such as the crown of a

little boy's head, or the shoulders of a by-stander who had no

business there except to taste the brew; a proceeding which would

have been deemed humorous but for the air of stern rigidity which

that auctioneer's face preserved, tending to show that the

eccentricity was a result of that absence of mind which is

engendered by the press of affairs, and no freak of fancy at all.



Mr. Melbury stood slightly apart from the rest of the

Peripatetics, and Grace beside him, clinging closely to his arm,

her modern attire looking almost odd where everything else was

old-fashioned, and throwing over the familiar garniture of the

trees a homeliness that seemed to demand improvement by the

addition of a few contemporary novelties also.  Grace seemed to

regard the selling with the interest which attaches to memories

revived after an interval of obliviousness.



Winterborne went and stood close to them; the timber-merchant

spoke, and continued his buying; Grace merely smiled.  To justify

his presence there Winterborne began bidding for timber and fagots

that he did not want, pursuing the occupation in an abstracted

mood, in which the auctioneer's voice seemed to become one of the

natural sounds of the woodland.  A few flakes of snow descended,

at the sight of which a robin, alarmed at these signs of imminent

winter, and seeing that no offence was meant by the human

invasion, came and perched on the tip of the fagots that were

being sold, and looked into the auctioneer's face, while waiting

for some chance crumb from the bread-basket.  Standing a little

behind Grace, Winterborne observed how one flake would sail

downward and settle on a curl of her hair, and how another would

choose her shoulder, and another the edge of her bonnet, which

took up so much of his attention that his biddings proceeded

incoherently; and when the auctioneer said, every now and then,

with a nod towards him, "Yours, Mr. Winterborne," he had no idea

whether he had bought fagots, poles, or logwood.



He regretted, with some causticity of humor, that her father

should show such inequalities of temperament as to keep Grace

tightly on his arm to-day, when he had quite lately seemed anxious

to recognize their betrothal as a fact.  And thus musing, and

joining in no conversation with other buyers except when directly

addressed, he followed the assemblage hither and thither till the

end of the auction, when Giles for the first time realized what

his purchases had been.  Hundreds of fagots, and divers lots of

timber, had been set down to him, when all he had required had

been a few bundles of spray for his odd man Robert Creedle's use

in baking and lighting fires.



Business being over, he turned to speak to the timber merchant. 

But Melbury's manner was short and distant; and Grace, too, looked

vexed and reproachful.  Winterborne then discovered that he had

been unwittingly bidding against her father, and picking up his

favorite lots in spite of him.  With a very few words they left

the spot and pursued their way homeward.



Giles was extremely sorry at what he had done, and remained

standing under the trees, all the other men having strayed

silently away.  He saw Melbury and his daughter pass down a glade

without looking back.  While they moved slowly through it a lady

appeared on horseback in the middle distance, the line of her

progress converging upon that of Melbury's.  They met, Melbury

took off his hat, and she reined in her horse.  A conversation was

evidently in progress between Grace and her father and this

equestrian, in whom he was almost sure that he recognized Mrs.

Charmond, less by her outline than by the livery of the groom who

had halted some yards off.



The interlocutors did not part till after a prolonged pause,

during which much seemed to be said.  When Melbury and Grace

resumed their walk it was with something of a lighter tread than

before.



Winterborne then pursued his own course homeward.  He was

unwilling to let coldness grow up between himself and the Melburys

for any trivial reason, and in the evening he went to their house. 

On drawing near the gate his attention was attracted by the sight

of one of the bedrooms blinking into a state of illumination.  In

it stood Grace lighting several candles, her right hand elevating

the taper, her left hand on her bosom, her face thoughtfully fixed

on each wick as it kindled, as if she saw in every flame's growth

the rise of a life to maturity.  He wondered what such unusual

brilliancy could mean to-night.  On getting in-doors he found her

father and step-mother in a state of suppressed excitement, which

at first he could not comprehend.



"I am sorry about my biddings to-day," said Giles.  "I don't know

what I was doing.  I have come to say that any of the lots you may

require are yours."



"Oh, never mind--never mind," replied the timber-merchant, with a

slight wave of his hand, "I have so much else to think of that I

nearly had forgot it.  Just now, too, there are matters of a

different kind from trade to attend to, so don't let it concern

ye."



As the timber-merchant spoke, as it were, down to him from a

higher moral plane than his own, Giles turned to Mrs. Melbury.



"Grace is going to the House to-morrow," she said, quietly.  "She

is looking out her things now.  I dare say she is wanting me this

minute to assist her." Thereupon Mrs. Melbury left the room.



Nothing is more remarkable than the independent personality of the

tongue now and then.  Mr. Melbury knew that his words had been a

sort of boast.  He decried boasting, particularly to Giles; yet

whenever the subject was Grace, his judgment resigned the ministry

of speech in spite of him.



Winterborne felt surprise, pleasure, and also a little

apprehension at the news.  He repeated Mrs. Melbury's words.



"Yes," said paternal pride, not sorry to have dragged out of him

what he could not in any circumstances have kept in.  "Coming home

from the woods this afternoon we met Mrs. Charmond out for a ride. 

She spoke to me on a little matter of business, and then got

acquainted with Grace.  'Twas wonderful how she took to Grace in a

few minutes; that freemasonry of education made 'em close at once. 

Naturally enough she was amazed that such an article--ha, ha!--

could come out of my house.  At last it led on to Mis'ess Grace

being asked to the House.  So she's busy hunting up her frills and

furbelows to go in."  As Giles remained in thought without

responding, Melbury continued: "But I'll call her down-stairs."



"No, no; don't do that, since she's busy," said Winterborne.



Melbury, feeling from the young man's manner that his own talk had

been too much at Giles and too little to him, repented at once. 

His face changed, and he said, in lower tones, with an effort,

"She's yours, Giles, as far as I am concerned."



"Thanks--my best thanks....But I think, since it is all right

between us about the biddings, that I'll not interrupt her now. 

I'll step homeward, and call another time."



On leaving the house he looked up at the bedroom again.  Grace,

surrounded by a sufficient number of candles to answer all

purposes of self-criticism, was standing before a cheval-glass

that her father had lately bought expressly for her use; she was

bonneted, cloaked, and gloved, and glanced over her shoulder into

the mirror, estimating her aspect.  Her face was lit with the

natural elation of a young girl hoping to inaugurate on the morrow

an intimate acquaintance with a new, interesting, and powerful

friend.
