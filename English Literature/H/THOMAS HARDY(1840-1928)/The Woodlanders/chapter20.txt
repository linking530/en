The leaves over Hintock grew denser in their substance, and the

woodland seemed to change from an open filigree to a solid opaque

body of infinitely larger shape and importance.  The boughs cast

green shades, which hurt the complexion of the girls who walked

there; and a fringe of them which overhung Mr. Melbury's garden

dripped on his seed-plots when it rained, pitting their surface

all over as with pock-marks, till Melbury declared that gardens in

such a place were no good at all.  The two trees that had creaked

all the winter left off creaking, the whir of the night-jar,

however, forming a very satisfactory continuation of uncanny music

from that quarter.  Except at mid-day the sun was not seen

complete by the Hintock people, but rather in the form of numerous

little stars staring through the leaves.



Such an appearance it had on Midsummer Eve of this year, and as

the hour grew later, and nine o'clock drew on, the irradiation of

the daytime became broken up by weird shadows and ghostly nooks of

indistinctness.  Imagination could trace upon the trunks and

boughs strange faces and figures shaped by the dying lights; the

surfaces of the holly-leaves would here and there shine like

peeping eyes, while such fragments of the sky as were visible

between the trunks assumed the aspect of sheeted forms and cloven

tongues.  This was before the moonrise.  Later on, when that

planet was getting command of the upper heaven, and consequently

shining with an unbroken face into such open glades as there were

in the neighborhood of the hamlet, it became apparent that the

margin of the wood which approached the timber-merchant's premises

was not to be left to the customary stillness of that reposeful

time.



Fitzpiers having heard a voice or voices, was looking over his

garden gate--where he now looked more frequently than into his

books--fancying that Grace might be abroad with some friends.  He

was now irretrievably committed in heart to Grace Melbury, though

he was by no means sure that she was so far committed to him. 

That the Idea had for once completely fulfilled itself in the

objective substance--which he had hitherto deemed an

impossibility--he was enchanted enough to fancy must be the case

at last.  It was not Grace who had passed, however, but several of

the ordinary village girls in a group--some steadily walking, some

in a mood of wild gayety.  He quietly asked his landlady, who was

also in the garden, what these girls were intending, and she

informed him that it being Old Midsummer Eve, they were about to

attempt some spell or enchantment which would afford them a

glimpse of their future partners for life.  She declared it to be

an ungodly performance, and one which she for her part would never

countenance; saying which, she entered her house and retired to

bed.



The young man lit a cigar and followed the bevy of maidens slowly

up the road.  They had turned into the wood at an opening between

Melbury's and Marty South's; but Fitzpiers could easily track them

by their voices, low as they endeavored to keep their tones.



In the mean time other inhabitants of Little Hintock had become

aware of the nocturnal experiment about to be tried, and were also

sauntering stealthily after the frisky maidens.  Miss Melbury had

been informed by Marty South during the day of the proposed peep

into futurity, and, being only a girl like the rest, she was

sufficiently interested to wish to see the issue.  The moon was so

bright and the night so calm that she had no difficulty in

persuading Mrs. Melbury to accompany her; and thus, joined by

Marty, these went onward in the same direction.



Passing Winterborne's house, they heard a noise of hammering. 

Marty explained it.  This was the last night on which his paternal

roof would shelter him, the days of grace since it fell into hand

having expired; and Giles was taking down his cupboards and

bedsteads with a view to an early exit next morning.  His

encounter with Mrs. Charmond had cost him dearly.



When they had proceeded a little farther Marty was joined by

Grammer Oliver (who was as young as the youngest in such matters),

and Grace and Mrs. Melbury went on by themselves till they had

arrived at the spot chosen by the village daughters, whose primary

intention of keeping their expedition a secret had been quite

defeated.  Grace and her step-mother paused by a holly-tree; and

at a little distance stood Fitzpiers under the shade of a young

oak, intently observing Grace, who was in the full rays of the

moon.



He watched her without speaking, and unperceived by any but Marty

and Grammer, who had drawn up on the dark side of the same holly

which sheltered Mrs. and Miss Melbury on its bright side.  The two

former conversed in low tones.



"If they two come up in Wood next Midsummer Night they'll come as

one," said Grammer, signifying Fitzpiers and Grace.  "Instead of

my skellington he'll carry home her living carcass before long. 

But though she's a lady in herself, and worthy of any such as he,

it do seem to me that he ought to marry somebody more of the sort

of Mrs. Charmond, and that Miss Grace should make the best of

Winterborne."



Marty returned no comment; and at that minute the girls, some of

whom were from Great Hintock, were seen advancing to work the

incantation, it being now about midnight.



"Directly we see anything we'll run home as fast as we can," said

one, whose courage had begun to fail her.  To this the rest

assented, not knowing that a dozen neighbors lurked in the bushes

around.



"I wish we had not thought of trying this," said another, "but had

contented ourselves with the hole-digging to-morrow at twelve, and

hearing our husbands' trades.  It is too much like having dealings

with the Evil One to try to raise their forms."



However, they had gone too far to recede, and slowly began to

march forward in a skirmishing line through the trees towards the

deeper recesses of the wood.  As far as the listeners could

gather, the particular form of black-art to be practised on this

occasion was one connected with the sowing of hemp-seed, a handful

of which was carried by each girl.  At the moment of their advance

they looked back, and discerned the figure of Miss Melbury, who,

alone of all the observers, stood in the full face of the

moonlight, deeply engrossed in the proceedings.  By contrast with

her life of late years they made her feel as if she had receded a

couple of centuries in the world's history.  She was rendered

doubly conspicuous by her light dress, and after a few whispered

words, one of the girls--a bouncing maiden, plighted to young

Timothy Tangs--asked her if she would join in.  Grace, with some

excitement, said that she would, and moved on a little in the rear

of the rest.



Soon the listeners could hear nothing of their proceedings beyond

the faintest occasional rustle of leaves.  Grammer whispered again

to Marty: "Why didn't ye go and try your luck with the rest of the

maids?"



"I don't believe in it," said Marty, shortly.



"Why, half the parish is here--the silly hussies should have kept

it quiet.  I see Mr. Winterborne through the leaves, just come up

with Robert Creedle.  Marty, we ought to act the part o'

Providence sometimes.  Do go and tell him that if he stands just

behind the bush at the bottom of the slope, Miss Grace must pass

down it when she comes back, and she will most likely rush into

his arms; for as soon as the clock strikes, they'll bundle back

home--along like hares.  I've seen such larries before."



"Do you think I'd better?" said Marty, reluctantly.



"Oh yes, he'll bless ye for it."



"I don't want that kind of blessing." But after a moment's thought

she went and delivered the information; and Grammer had the

satisfaction of seeing Giles walk slowly to the bend in the leafy

defile along which Grace would have to return.



Meanwhile Mrs. Melbury, deserted by Grace, had perceived Fitzpiers

and Winterborne, and also the move of the latter.  An improvement

on Grammer's idea entered the mind of Mrs. Melbury, for she had

lately discerned what her husband had not--that Grace was rapidly

fascinating the surgeon.  She therefore drew near to Fitzpiers.



"You should be where Mr. Winterborne is standing," she said to

him, significantly.  "She will run down through that opening much

faster than she went up it, if she is like the rest of the girls."



Fitzpiers did not require to be told twice.  He went across to

Winterborne and stood beside him.  Each knew the probable purpose

of the other in standing there, and neither spoke, Fitzpiers

scorning to look upon Winterborne as a rival, and Winterborne

adhering to the off-hand manner of indifference which had grown

upon him since his dismissal.



Neither Grammer nor Marty South had seen the surgeon's manoeuvre,

and, still to help Winterborne, as she supposed, the old woman

suggested to the wood-girl that she should walk forward at the

heels of Grace, and "tole" her down the required way if she showed

a tendency to run in another direction.  Poor Marty, always doomed

to sacrifice desire to obligation, walked forward accordingly, and

waited as a beacon, still and silent, for the retreat of Grace and

her giddy companions, now quite out of hearing.



The first sound to break the silence was the distant note of Great

Hintock clock striking the significant hour.  About a minute later

that quarter of the wood to which the girls had wandered resounded

with the flapping of disturbed birds; then two or three hares and

rabbits bounded down the glade from the same direction, and after

these the rustling and crackling of leaves and dead twigs denoted

the hurried approach of the adventurers, whose fluttering gowns

soon became visible.  Miss Melbury, having gone forward quite in

the rear of the rest, was one of the first to return, and the

excitement being contagious, she ran laughing towards Marty, who

still stood as a hand-post to guide her; then, passing on, she

flew round the fatal bush where the undergrowth narrowed to a

gorge.  Marty arrived at her heels just in time to see the result. 

Fitzpiers had quickly stepped forward in front of Winterborne,

who, disdaining to shift his position, had turned on his heel, and

then the surgeon did what he would not have thought of doing but

for Mrs. Melbury's encouragement and the sentiment of an eve which

effaced conventionality.  Stretching out his arms as the white

figure burst upon him, he captured her in a moment, as if she had

been a bird.



"Oh!" cried Grace, in her fright.



"You are in my arms, dearest," said Fitzpiers, "and I am going to

claim you, and keep you there all our two lives!"



She rested on him like one utterly mastered, and it was several

seconds before she recovered from this helplessness.  Subdued

screams and struggles, audible from neighboring brakes, revealed

that there had been other lurkers thereabout for a similar

purpose.  Grace, unlike most of these companions of hers, instead

of gasping and writhing, said in a trembling voice, "Mr.

Fitzpiers, will you let me go?"



"Certainly," he said, laughing; "as soon as you have recovered."



She waited another few moments, then quietly and firmly pushed him

aside, and glided on her path, the moon whitening her hot blush

away.  But it had been enough--new relations between them had

begun.



The case of the other girls was different, as has been said.  They

wrestled and tittered, only escaping after a desperate struggle. 

Fitzpiers could hear these enactments still going on after Grace

had left him, and he remained on the spot where he had caught her,

Winterborne having gone away.  On a sudden another girl came

bounding down the same descent that had been followed by Grace--a

fine-framed young woman with naked arms.  Seeing Fitzpiers

standing there, she said, with playful effrontery, "May'st kiss me

if 'canst catch me, Tim!"



Fitzpiers recognized her as Suke Damson, a hoydenish damsel of

the hamlet, who was plainly mistaking him for her lover.  He was

impulsively disposed to profit by her error, and as soon as she

began racing away he started in pursuit.



On she went under the boughs, now in light, now in shade, looking

over her shoulder at him every few moments and kissing her hand;

but so cunningly dodging about among the trees and moon-shades

that she never allowed him to get dangerously near her.  Thus they

ran and doubled, Fitzpiers warming with the chase, till the sound

of their companions had quite died away.  He began to lose hope of

ever overtaking her, when all at once, by way of encouragement,

she turned to a fence in which there was a stile and leaped over

it.  Outside the scene was a changed one--a meadow, where the

half-made hay lay about in heaps, in the uninterrupted shine of

the now high moon.



Fitzpiers saw in a moment that, having taken to open ground, she

had placed herself at his mercy, and he promptly vaulted over

after her.  She flitted a little way down the mead, when all at

once her light form disappeared as if it had sunk into the earth. 

She had buried herself in one of the hay-cocks.



Fitzpiers, now thoroughly excited, was not going to let her escape

him thus.  He approached, and set about turning over the heaps one

by one.  As soon as he paused, tantalized and puzzled, he was

directed anew by an imitative kiss which came from her hiding-

place, and by snatches of a local ballad in the smallest voice she

could assume:





    "O come in from the foggy, foggy dew."





In a minute or two he uncovered her.



"Oh, 'tis not Tim!" said she, burying her face.



Fitzpiers, however, disregarded her resistance by reason of its

mildness, stooped and imprinted the purposed kiss, then sunk down

on the next hay-cock, panting with his race.



"Whom do you mean by Tim?" he asked, presently.



"My young man, Tim Tangs," said she.



"Now, honor bright, did you really think it was he?"



"I did at first."



"But you didn't at last?"



"I didn't at last."



"Do you much mind that it was not?"



"No," she answered, slyly.



Fitzpiers did not pursue his questioning.  In the moonlight Suke

looked very beautiful, the scratches and blemishes incidental to

her out-door occupation being invisible under these pale rays. 

While they remain silent the coarse whir of the eternal night-jar

burst sarcastically from the top of a tree at the nearest corner

of the wood.  Besides this not a sound of any kind reached their

ears, the time of nightingales being now past, and Hintock lying

at a distance of two miles at least.  In the opposite direction

the hay-field stretched away into remoteness till it was lost to

the eye in a soft mist.
