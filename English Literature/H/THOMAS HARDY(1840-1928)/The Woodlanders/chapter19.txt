Instead of resuming his investigation of South's brain, which

perhaps was not so interesting under the microscope as might have

been expected from the importance of that organ in life, Fitzpiers

reclined and ruminated on the interview.  Grace's curious

susceptibility to his presence, though it was as if the currents

of her life were disturbed rather than attracted by him, added a

special interest to her general charm.  Fitzpiers was in a

distinct degree scientific, being ready and zealous to interrogate

all physical manifestations, but primarily he was an idealist.  He

believed that behind the imperfect lay the perfect; that rare

things were to be discovered amid a bulk of commonplace; that

results in a new and untried case might be different from those in

other cases where the conditions had been precisely similar. 

Regarding his own personality as one of unbounded possibilities,

because it was his own--notwithstanding that the factors of his

life had worked out a sorry product for thousands--he saw nothing

but what was regular in his discovery at Hintock of an altogether

exceptional being of the other sex, who for nobody else would have

had any existence.



One habit of Fitzpiers's--commoner in dreamers of more advanced

age than in men of his years--was that of talking to himself.  He

paced round his room with a selective tread upon the more

prominent blooms of the carpet, and murmured, "This phenomenal

girl will be the light of my life while I am at Hintock; and the

special beauty of the situation is that our attitude and relations

to each other will be purely spiritual.  Socially we can never be

intimate.  Anything like matrimonial intentions towards her,

charming as she is, would be absurd.  They would spoil the

ethereal character of my regard.  And, indeed, I have other aims

on the practical side of my life."



Fitzpiers bestowed a regulation thought on the advantageous

marriage he was bound to make with a woman of family as good as

his own, and of purse much longer.  But as an object of

contemplation for the present, as objective spirit rather than

corporeal presence, Grace Melbury would serve to keep his soul

alive, and to relieve the monotony of his days.



His first notion--acquired from the mere sight of her without

converse--that of an idle and vulgar flirtation with a timber-

merchant's pretty daughter, grated painfully upon him now that he

had found what Grace intrinsically was.  Personal intercourse with

such as she could take no lower form than intellectual communion,

and mutual explorations of the world of thought.  Since he could

not call at her father's, having no practical views, cursory

encounters in the lane, in the wood, coming and going to and from

church, or in passing her dwelling, were what the acquaintance

would have to feed on.



Such anticipated glimpses of her now and then realized themselves

in the event.  Rencounters of not more than a minute's duration,

frequently repeated, will build up mutual interest, even an

intimacy, in a lonely place.  Theirs grew as imperceptibly as the

tree-twigs budded.  There never was a particular moment at which

it could be said they became friends; yet a delicate understanding

now existed between two who in the winter had been strangers.



Spring weather came on rather suddenly, the unsealing of buds that

had long been swollen accomplishing itself in the space of one

warm night.  The rush of sap in the veins of the trees could

almost be heard.  The flowers of late April took up a position

unseen, and looked as if they had been blooming a long while,

though there had been no trace of them the day before yesterday;

birds began not to mind getting wet.  In-door people said they had

heard the nightingale, to which out-door people replied

contemptuously that they had heard him a fortnight before.



The young doctor's practice being scarcely so large as a London

surgeon's, he frequently walked in the wood.  Indeed such practice

as he had he did not follow up with the assiduity that would have

been necessary for developing it to exceptional proportions.  One

day, book in hand, he walked in a part of the wood where the trees

were mainly oaks.  It was a calm afternoon, and there was

everywhere around that sign of great undertakings on the part of

vegetable nature which is apt to fill reflective human beings who

are not undertaking much themselves with a sudden uneasiness at

the contrast.  He heard in the distance a curious sound, something

like the quack of a duck, which, though it was common enough here

about this time, was not common to him.



Looking through the trees Fitzpiers soon perceived the origin of

the noise.  The barking season had just commenced, and what he had

heard was the tear of the ripping tool as it ploughed its way

along the sticky parting between the trunk and the rind.  Melbury

did a large business in bark, and as he was Grace's father, and

possibly might be found on the spot, Fitzpiers was attracted to

the scene even more than he might have been by its intrinsic

interest.  When he got nearer he recognized among the workmen the

two Timothys, and Robert Creedle, who probably had been "lent" by

Winterborne; Marty South also assisted.



Each tree doomed to this flaying process was first attacked by

Creedle.  With a small billhook he carefully freed the collar of

the tree from twigs and patches of moss which incrusted it to a

height of a foot or two above the ground, an operation comparable

to the "little toilet" of the executioner's victim.  After this it

was barked in its erect position to a point as high as a man could

reach.  If a fine product of vegetable nature could ever be said

to look ridiculous it was the case now, when the oak stood naked-

legged, and as if ashamed, till the axe-man came and cut a ring

round it, and the two Timothys finished the work with the

crosscut-saw.



As soon as it had fallen the barkers attacked it like locusts, and

in a short time not a particle of rind was left on the trunk and

larger limbs.  Marty South was an adept at peeling the upper

parts, and there she stood encaged amid the mass of twigs and buds

like a great bird, running her tool into the smallest branches,

beyond the farthest points to which the skill and patience of the

men enabled them to proceed--branches which, in their lifetime,

had swayed high above the bulk of the wood, and caught the latest

and earliest rays of the sun and moon while the lower part of the

forest was still in darkness.



"You seem to have a better instrument than they, Marty," said

Fitzpiers.



"No, sir," she said, holding up the tool--a horse's leg-bone

fitted into a handle and filed to an edge--"'tis only that they've

less patience with the twigs, because their time is worth more

than mine."



A little shed had been constructed on the spot, of thatched

hurdles and boughs, and in front of it was a fire, over which a

kettle sung.  Fitzpiers sat down inside the shelter, and went on

with his reading, except when he looked up to observe the scene

and the actors.  The thought that he might settle here and become

welded in with this sylvan life by marrying Grace Melbury crossed

his mind for a moment.  Why should he go farther into the world

than where he was?  The secret of quiet happiness lay in limiting

the ideas and aspirations; these men's thoughts were conterminous

with the margin of the Hintock woodlands, and why should not his

be likewise limited--a small practice among the people around him

being the bound of his desires?



Presently Marty South discontinued her operations upon the

quivering boughs, came out from the reclining oak, and prepared

tea.  When it was ready the men were called; and Fitzpiers being

in a mood to join, sat down with them.



The latent reason of his lingering here so long revealed itself

when the faint creaking of the joints of a vehicle became audible,

and one of the men said, "Here's he." Turning their heads they saw

Melbury's gig approaching, the wheels muffled by the yielding

moss.



The timber-merchant was on foot leading the horse, looking back at

every few steps to caution his daughter, who kept her seat, where

and how to duck her head so as to avoid the overhanging branches. 

They stopped at the spot where the bark-ripping had been

temporarily suspended; Melbury cursorily examined the heaps of

bark, and drawing near to where the workmen were sitting down,

accepted their shouted invitation to have a dish of tea, for which

purpose he hitched the horse to a bough.  (Grace declined to take

any of their beverage, and remained in her place in the vehicle,

looking dreamily at the sunlight that came in thin threads through

the hollies with which the oaks were interspersed.



When Melbury stepped up close to the shelter, he for the first

time perceived that the doctor was present, and warmly appreciated

Fitzpiers's invitation to sit down on the log beside him.



"Bless my heart, who would have thought of finding you here," he

said, obviously much pleased at the circumstance.  "I wonder now

if my daughter knows you are so nigh at hand.  I don't expect she

do."



He looked out towards the gig wherein Grace sat, her face still

turned in the opposite direction.  "She doesn't see us.  Well,

never mind: let her be."



Grace was indeed quite unconscious of Fitzpiers's propinquity. 

She was thinking of something which had little connection with the 

scene before her--thinking of her friend, lost as soon as found,

Mrs. Charmond; of her capricious conduct, and of the contrasting

scenes she was possibly enjoying at that very moment in other

climes, to which Grace herself had hoped to be introduced by her

friend's means.  She wondered if this patronizing lady would

return to Hintock during the summer, and whether the acquaintance

which had been nipped on the last occasion of her residence there

would develop on the next.



Melbury told ancient timber-stories as he sat, relating them

directly to Fitzpiers, and obliquely to the men, who had heard

them often before.  Marty, who poured out tea, was just saying, "I

think I'll take out a cup to Miss Grace," when they heard a

clashing of the gig-harness, and turning round Melbury saw that

the horse had become restless, and was jerking about the vehicle

in a way which alarmed its occupant, though she refrained from

screaming.  Melbury jumped up immediately, but not more quickly

than Fitzpiers; and while her father ran to the horse's head and

speedily began to control him, Fitzpiers was alongside the gig

assisting Grace to descend.  Her surprise at his appearance was so

great that, far from making a calm and independent descent, she

was very nearly lifted down in his arms.  He relinquished her when

she touched ground, and hoped she was not frightened.



"Oh no, not much," she managed to say.  "There was no danger--

unless he had run under the trees where the boughs are low enough

to hit my head."



"Which was by no means an impossibility, and justifies any amount

of alarm."



He referred to what he thought he saw written in her face, and she

could not tell him that this had little to do with the horse, but

much with himself.  His contiguity had, in fact, the same effect

upon her as on those former occasions when he had come closer to

her than usual--that of producing in her an unaccountable tendency

to tearfulness.  Melbury soon put the horse to rights, and seeing

that Grace was safe, turned again to the work-people.  His

daughter's nervous distress had passed off in a few moments, and

she said quite gayly to Fitzpiers as she walked with him towards

the group, "There's destiny in it, you see.  I was doomed to join

in your picnic, although I did not intend to do so."



Marty prepared her a comfortable place, and she sat down in the

circle, and listened to Fitzpiers while he drew from her father

and the bark-rippers sundry narratives of their fathers', their

grandfathers', and their own adventures in these woods; of the

mysterious sights they had seen--only to be accounted for by

supernatural agency; of white witches and black witches; and the

standard story of the spirits of the two brothers who had fought

and fallen, and had haunted Hintock House till they were exorcised

by the priest, and compelled to retreat to a swamp in this very

wood, whence they were returning to their old quarters at the rate

of a cock's stride every New-year's Day, old style; hence the

local saying, "On New-year's tide, a cock's stride."



It was a pleasant time.  The smoke from the little fire of peeled

sticks rose between the sitters and the sunlight, and behind its

blue veil stretched the naked arms of the prostrate trees The

smell of the uncovered sap mingled with the smell of the burning

wood, and the sticky inner surface of the scattered bark glistened

as it revealed its pale madder hues to the eye.  Melbury was so

highly satisfied at having Fitzpiers as a sort of guest that he

would have sat on for any length of time, but Grace, on whom

Fitzpiers's eyes only too frequently alighted, seemed to think it

incumbent upon her to make a show of going; and her father

thereupon accompanied her to the vehicle.



As the doctor had helped her out of it he appeared to think that

he had excellent reasons for helping her in, and performed the

attention lingeringly enough.



"What were you almost in tears about just now?" he asked, softly.



"I don't know," she said: and the words were strictly true.



Melbury mounted on the other side, and they drove on out of the

grove, their wheels silently crushing delicate-patterned mosses,

hyacinths, primroses, lords-and-ladies, and other strange and

ordinary plants, and cracking up little sticks that lay across the

track.  Their way homeward ran along the crest of a lofty hill,

whence on the right they beheld a wide valley, differing both in

feature and atmosphere from that of the Hintock precincts.  It was

the cider country, which met the woodland district on the axis of

this hill.  Over the vale the air was blue as sapphire--such a

blue as outside that apple-valley was never seen.  Under the blue

the orchards were in a blaze of bloom, some of the richly flowered

trees running almost up to where they drove along.  Over a gate

which opened down the incline a man leaned on his arms, regarding

this fair promise so intently that he did not observe their

passing.



"That was Giles," said Melbury, when they had gone by.



"Was it? Poor Giles," said she.



"All that blooth means heavy autumn work for him and his hands. 

If no blight happens before the setting the apple yield will be

such as we have not had for years."



Meanwhile, in the wood they had come from, the men had sat on so

long that they were indisposed to begin work again that evening;

they were paid by the ton, and their time for labor was as they

chose.  They placed the last gatherings of bark in rows for the

curers, which led them farther and farther away from the shed; and

thus they gradually withdrew as the sun went down.



Fitzpiers lingered yet.  He had opened his book again, though he

could hardly see a word in it, and sat before the dying fire,

scarcely knowing of the men's departure.  He dreamed and mused

till his consciousness seemed to occupy the whole space of the

woodland around, so little was there of jarring sight or sound to

hinder perfect unity with the sentiment of the place.  The idea

returned upon him of sacrificing all practical aims to live in

calm contentment here, and instead of going on elaborating new

conceptions with infinite pains, to accept quiet domesticity

according to oldest and homeliest notions.  These reflections

detained him till the wood was embrowned with the coming night,

and the shy little bird of this dusky time had begun to pour out

all the intensity of his eloquence from a bush not very far off.



Fitzpiers's eyes commanded as much of the ground in front as was

open.  Entering upon this he saw a figure, whose direction of

movement was towards the spot where he sat.  The surgeon was quite

shrouded from observation by the recessed shadow of the hut, and

there was no reason why he should move till the stranger had

passed by.  The shape resolved itself into a woman's; she was

looking on the ground, and walking slowly as if searching for

something that had been lost, her course being precisely that of

Mr. Melbury's gig.  Fitzpiers by a sort of divination jumped to

the idea that the figure was Grace's; her nearer approach made the

guess a certainty.



Yes, she was looking for something; and she came round by the

prostrate trees that would have been invisible but for the white

nakedness which enabled her to avoid them easily.  Thus she

approached the heap of ashes, and acting upon what was suggested

by a still shining ember or two, she took a stick and stirred the

heap, which thereupon burst into a flame.  On looking around by

the light thus obtained she for the first time saw the illumined

face of Fitzpiers, precisely in the spot where she had left him.



Grace gave a start and a scream: the place had been associated

with him in her thoughts, but she had not expected to find him

there still.  Fitzpiers lost not a moment in rising and going to

her side.



"I frightened you dreadfully, I know," he said.  "I ought to have

spoken; but I did not at first expect it to be you.  I have been

sitting here ever since."



He was actually supporting her with his arm, as though under the

impression that she was quite overcome, and in danger of falling. 

As soon as she could collect her ideas she gently withdrew from

his grasp, and explained what she had returned for: in getting up

or down from the gig, or when sitting by the hut fire, she had

dropped her purse.



"Now we will find it," said Fitzpiers.



He threw an armful of last year's leaves on to the fire, which

made the flame leap higher, and the encompassing shades to weave

themselves into a denser contrast, turning eve into night in a

moment.  By this radiance they groped about on their hands and

knees, till Fitzpiers rested on his elbow, and looked at Grace. 

"We must always meet in odd circumstances," he said; "and this is

one of the oddest.  I wonder if it means anything?"



"Oh no, I am sure it doesn't," said Grace in haste, quickly

assuming an erect posture.  "Pray don't say it any more."



"I hope there was not much money in the purse," said Fitzpiers,

rising to his feet more slowly, and brushing the leaves from his

trousers.



"Scarcely any.  I cared most about the purse itself, because it

was given me.  Indeed, money is of little more use at Hintock than

on Crusoe's island; there's hardly any way of spending it."



They had given up the search when Fitzpiers discerned something by

his foot.  "Here it is," he said, "so that your father, mother,

friend, or ADMIRER will not have his or her feelings hurt by a

sense of your negligence after all."



"Oh, he knows nothing of what I do now."



"The admirer?" said Fitzpiers, slyly.



"I don't know if you would call him that," said Grace, with

simplicity.  "The admirer is a superficial, conditional creature,

and this person is quite different."



"He has all the cardinal virtues."



"Perhaps--though I don't know them precisely."



"You unconsciously practise them, Miss Melbury, which is better. 

According to Schleiermacher they are Self-control, Perseverance,

Wisdom, and Love; and his is the best list that I know."



"I am afraid poor--" She was going to say that she feared

Winterborne--the giver of the purse years before--had not much

perseverance, though he had all the other three; but she

determined to go no further in this direction, and was silent.



These half-revelations made a perceptible difference in Fitzpiers. 

His sense of personal superiority wasted away, and Grace assumed

in his eyes the true aspect of a mistress in her lover's regard.



"Miss Melbury," he said, suddenly, "I divine that this virtuous

man you mention has been refused by you?"



She could do no otherwise than admit it.



"I do not inquire without good reason.  God forbid that I should

kneel in another's place at any shrine unfairly.  But, my dear

Miss Melbury, now that he is gone, may I draw near?"



"I--I can't say anything about that!" she cried, quickly. 

"Because when a man has been refused you feel pity for him, and

like him more than you did before."



This increasing complication added still more value to Grace in

the surgeon's eyes: it rendered her adorable.  "But cannot you

say?" he pleaded, distractedly.



"I'd rather not--I think I must go home at once."



"Oh yes," said Fitzpiers.  But as he did not move she felt it

awkward to walk straight away from him; and so they stood silently

together.  A diversion was created by the accident of two birds,

that had either been roosting above their heads or nesting there,

tumbling one over the other into the hot ashes at their feet,

apparently engrossed in a desperate quarrel that prevented the use

of their wings.  They speedily parted, however, and flew up, and

were seen no more.



"That's the end of what is called love!" said some one.



The speaker was neither Grace nor Fitzpiers, but Marty South, who

approached with her face turned up to the sky in her endeavor to

trace the birds.  Suddenly perceiving Grace, she exclaimed, "Oh,

Miss Melbury! I have been following they pigeons, and didn't see

you.  And here's Mr. Winterborne!" she continued, shyly, as she

looked towards Fitzpiers, who stood in the background.



"Marty," Grace interrupted.  "I want you to walk home with me--

will you? Come along." And without lingering longer she took hold

of Marty's arm and led her away.



They went between the spectral arms of the peeled trees as they

lay, and onward among the growing trees, by a path where there

were no oaks, and no barking, and no Fitzpiers--nothing but copse-

wood, between which the primroses could be discerned in pale

bunches.  "I didn't know Mr. Winterborne was there," said Marty,

breaking the silence when they had nearly reached Grace's door.



"Nor was he," said Grace.



"But, Miss Melbury, I saw him."



"No," said Grace.  "It was somebody else.  Giles Winterborne is

nothing to me."
