When Melbury heard what had happened he seemed much moved, and

walked thoughtfully about the premises.  On South's own account he

was genuinely sorry; and on Winterborne's he was the more grieved

in that this catastrophe had so closely followed the somewhat

harsh dismissal of Giles as the betrothed of his daughter.



He was quite angry with circumstances for so heedlessly inflicting

on Giles a second trouble when the needful one inflicted by

himself was all that the proper order of events demanded.  "I told

Giles's father when he came into those houses not to spend too

much money on lifehold property held neither for his own life nor

his son's," he exclaimed.  "But he wouldn't listen to me.  And now

Giles has to suffer for it."



"Poor Giles!" murmured Grace.



"Now, Grace, between us two, it is very, very remarkable.  It is

almost as if I had foreseen this; and I am thankful for your

escape, though I am sincerely sorry for Giles.  Had we not

dismissed him already, we could hardly have found it in our hearts

to dismiss him now.  So I say, be thankful.  I'll do all I can for

him as a friend; but as a pretender to the position of my son-in

law, that can never be thought of more."



And yet at that very moment the impracticability to which poor

Winterborne's suit had been reduced was touching Grace's heart to

a warmer sentiment on his behalf than she had felt for years

concerning him.



He, meanwhile, was sitting down alone in the old familiar house

which had ceased to be his, taking a calm if somewhat dismal

survey of affairs.  The pendulum of the clock bumped every now and

then against one side of the case in which it swung, as the

muffled drum to his worldly march.  Looking out of the window he

could perceive that a paralysis had come over Creedle's occupation

of manuring the garden, owing, obviously, to a conviction that

they might not be living there long enough to profit by next

season's crop.



He looked at the leases again and the letter attached.  There was

no doubt that he had lost his houses by an accident which might

easily have been circumvented if he had known the true conditions

of his holding.  The time for performance had now lapsed in strict

law; but might not the intention be considered by the landholder

when she became aware of the circumstances, and his moral right to

retain the holdings for the term of his life be conceded?



His heart sank within him when he perceived that despite all the

legal reciprocities and safeguards prepared and written, the

upshot of the matter amounted to this, that it depended upon the

mere caprice--good or ill--of the woman he had met the day before

in such an unfortunate way, whether he was to possess his houses

for life or no.



While he was sitting and thinking a step came to the door, and

Melbury appeared, looking very sorry for his position. 

Winterborne welcomed him by a word and a look, and went on with

his examination of the parchments.  His visitor sat down.



"Giles," he said, "this is very awkward, and I am sorry for it. 

What are you going to do?"



Giles informed him of the real state of affairs, and how barely he

had missed availing himself of his chance of renewal.



"What a misfortune! Why was this neglected?  Well, the best thing

you can do is to write and tell her all about it, and throw

yourself upon her generosity."



"I would rather not," murmured Giles.



"But you must," said Melbury.



In short, he argued so cogently that Giles allowed himself to be

persuaded, and the letter to Mrs. Charmond was written and sent to

Hintock House, whence, as he knew, it would at once be forwarded

to her.



Melbury feeling that he had done so good an action in coming as

almost to extenuate his previous arbitrary conduct to nothing,

went home; and Giles was left alone to the suspense of waiting for

a reply from the divinity who shaped the ends of the Hintock

population.  By this time all the villagers knew of the

circumstances, and being wellnigh like one family, a keen interest

was the result all round.



Everybody thought of Giles; nobody thought of Marty.  Had any of

them looked in upon her during those moonlight nights which

preceded the burial of her father, they would have seen the girl

absolutely alone in the house with the dead man.  Her own chamber

being nearest the stairs, the coffin had been placed there for

convenience; and at a certain hour of the night, when the moon

arrived opposite the window, its beams streamed across the still

profile of South, sublimed by the august presence of death, and

onward a few feet farther upon the face of his daughter, lying in

her little bed in the stillness of a repose almost as dignified as

that of her companion--the repose of a guileless soul that had

nothing more left on earth to lose, except a life which she did

not overvalue.



South was buried, and a week passed, and Winterborne watched for a

reply from Mrs. Charmond.  Melbury was very sanguine as to its

tenor; but Winterborne had not told him of the encounter with her

carriage, when, if ever he had heard an affronted tone on a

woman's lips, he had heard it on hers.



The postman's time for passing was just after Melbury's men had

assembled in the spar-house; and Winterborne, who when not busy on

his own account would lend assistance there, used to go out into

the lane every morning and meet the post-man at the end of one of

the green rides through the hazel copse, in the straight stretch

of which his laden figure could be seen a long way off.  Grace

also was very anxious; more anxious than her father; more,

perhaps, than Winterborne himself.  This anxiety led her into the

spar-house on some pretext or other almost every morning while

they were awaiting the reply.



Fitzpiers too, though he did not personally appear, was much

interested, and not altogether easy in his mind; for he had been

informed by an authority of what he had himself conjectured, that

if the tree had been allowed to stand, the old man would have gone

on complaining, but might have lived for twenty years.



Eleven times had Winterborne gone to that corner of the ride, and

looked up its long straight slope through the wet grays of winter

dawn.  But though the postman's bowed figure loomed in view pretty

regularly, he brought nothing for Giles.  On the twelfth day the

man of missives, while yet in the extreme distance, held up his

hand, and Winterborne saw a letter in it.  He took it into the

spar-house before he broke the seal, and those who were there

gathered round him while he read, Grace looking in at the door.



The letter was not from Mrs. Charmond herself, but her agent at

Sherton.  Winterborne glanced it over and looked up.



"It's all over," he said.



"Ah!" said they altogether.



"Her lawyer is instructed to say that Mrs. Charmond sees no reason

for disturbing the natural course of things, particularly as she

contemplates pulling the houses down," he said, quietly.



"Only think of that!" said several.



Winterborne had turned away, and said vehemently to himself, "Then

let her pull 'em down, and be d--d to her!"



Creedle looked at him with a face of seven sorrows, saying, "Ah,

'twas that sperrit that lost 'em for ye, maister!"



Winterborne subdued his feelings, and from that hour, whatever

they were, kept them entirely to himself.  There could be no doubt

that, up to this last moment, he had nourished a feeble hope of

regaining Grace in the event of this negotiation turning out a

success.  Not being aware of the fact that her father could have

settled upon her a fortune sufficient to enable both to live in

comfort, he deemed it now an absurdity to dream any longer of such

a vanity as making her his wife, and sank into silence forthwith.



Yet whatever the value of taciturnity to a man among strangers, it

is apt to express more than talkativeness when he dwells among

friends.  The countryman who is obliged to judge the time of day

from changes in external nature sees a thousand successive tints

and traits in the landscape which are never discerned by him who

hears the regular chime of a clock, because they are never in

request.  In like manner do we use our eyes on our taciturn

comrade.  The infinitesimal movement of muscle, curve, hair, and

wrinkle, which when accompanied by a voice goes unregarded, is

watched and translated in the lack of it, till virtually the whole

surrounding circle of familiars is charged with the reserved one's

moods and meanings.



This was the condition of affairs between Winterborne and his

neighbors after his stroke of ill-luck.  He held his tongue; and

they observed him, and knew that he was discomposed.



Mr. Melbury, in his compunction, thought more of the matter than

any one else, except his daughter.  Had Winterborne been going on

in the old fashion, Grace's father could have alluded to his

disapproval of the alliance every day with the greatest frankness;

but to speak any further on the subject he could not find it in

his heart to do now.  He hoped that Giles would of his own accord

make some final announcement that he entirely withdrew his

pretensions to Grace, and so get the thing past and done with. 

For though Giles had in a measure acquiesced in the wish of her

family, he could make matters unpleasant if he chose to work upon

Grace; and hence, when Melbury saw the young man approaching along

the road one day, he kept friendliness and frigidity exactly

balanced in his eye till he could see whether Giles's manner was

presumptive or not.



His manner was that of a man who abandoned all claims.  "I am glad

to meet ye, Mr. Melbury," he said, in a low voice, whose quality

he endeavored to make as practical as possible.  "I am afraid I

shall not be able to keep that mare I bought, and as I don't care

to sell her, I should like--if you don't object--to give her to

Miss Melbury.  The horse is very quiet, and would be quite safe

for her."



Mr. Melbury was rather affected at this.  "You sha'n't hurt your

pocket like that on our account, Giles.  Grace shall have the

horse, but I'll pay you what you gave for her, and any expense you

may have been put to for her keep."



He would not hear of any other terms, and thus it was arranged.  

They were now opposite Melbury's house, and the timber-merchant

pressed Winterborne to enter, Grace being out of the way.



"Pull round the settle, Giles," said the timber-merchant, as soon

as they were within.  "I should like to have a serious talk with

you."



Thereupon he put the case to Winterborne frankly, and in quite a

friendly way.  He declared that he did not like to be hard on a

man when he was in difficulty; but he really did not see how

Winterborne could marry his daughter now, without even a house to

take her to.



Giles quite acquiesced in the awkwardness of his situation.  But

from a momentary feeling that he would like to know Grace's mind

from her own lips, he did not speak out positively there and then. 

He accordingly departed somewhat abruptly, and went home to

consider whether he would seek to bring about a meeting with her.



In the evening, while he sat quietly pondering, he fancied that he

heard a scraping on the wall outside his house.  The boughs of a

monthly rose which grew there made such a noise sometimes, but as

no wind was stirring he knew that it could not be the rose-tree. 

He took up the candle and went out.  Nobody was near.  As he

turned, the light flickered on the whitewashed rough case of the

front, and he saw words written thereon in charcoal, which he read

as follows:





    "O Giles, you've lost your dwelling-place,

     And therefore, Giles, you'll lose your Grace."





Giles went in-doors.  He had his suspicions as to the scrawler of

those lines, but he could not be sure.  What suddenly filled his

heart far more than curiosity about their authorship was a

terrible belief that they were turning out to be true, try to see

Grace as he might.  They decided the question for him.  He sat

down and wrote a formal note to Melbury, in which he briefly

stated that he was placed in such a position as to make him share

to the full Melbury's view of his own and his daughter's promise,

made some years before; to wish that it should be considered as

cancelled, and they themselves quite released from any obligation

on account of it.



Having fastened up this their plenary absolution, he determined to

get it out of his hands and have done with it; to which end he

went off to Melbury's at once.  It was now so late that the family

had all retired;  he crept up to the house, thrust the note under

the door, and stole away as silently as he had come.



Melbury himself was the first to rise the next morning, and when

he had read the letter his relief was great.  "Very honorable of

Giles, very honorable," he kept saying to himself.  "I shall not

forget him.  Now to keep her up to her own true level."



It happened that Grace went out for an early ramble that morning,

passing through the door and gate while her father was in the

spar-house.  To go in her customary direction she could not avoid

passing Winterborne's house.  The morning sun was shining flat

upon its white surface, and the words, which still remained, were

immediately visible to her.  She read them.  Her face flushed to

crimson.  She could see Giles and Creedle talking together at the

back; the charred spar-gad with which the lines had been written

lay on the ground beneath the wall.  Feeling pretty sure that

Winterborne would observe her action, she quickly went up to the

wall, rubbed out "lose" and inserted "keep" in its stead.  Then

she made the best of her way home without looking behind her. 

Giles could draw an inference now if he chose.



There could not be the least doubt that gentle Grace was warming

to more sympathy with, and interest in, Giles Winterborne than

ever she had done while he was her promised lover; that since his

misfortune those social shortcomings of his, which contrasted so

awkwardly with her later experiences of life, had become obscured

by the generous revival of an old romantic attachment to him. 

Though mentally trained and tilled into foreignness of view, as

compared with her youthful time, Grace was not an ambitious girl,

and might, if left to herself, have declined Winterborne without

much discontent or unhappiness.  Her feelings just now were so far

from latent that the writing on the wall had thus quickened her to

an unusual rashness.



Having returned from her walk she sat at breakfast silently.  When

her step-mother had left the room she said to her father, "I have

made up my mind that I should like my engagement to Giles to

continue, for the present at any rate, till I can see further what

I ought to do."



Melbury looked much surprised.



"Nonsense," he said, sharply.  "You don't know what you are

talking about.  Look here."



He handed across to her the letter received from Giles.



She read it, and said no more.  Could he have seen her write on

the wall?  She did not know.  Fate, it seemed, would have it this

way, and there was nothing to do but to acquiesce.



It was a few hours after this that Winterborne, who, curiously

enough, had NOT perceived Grace writing, was clearing away the

tree from the front of South's late dwelling.  He saw Marty

standing in her door-way, a slim figure in meagre black, almost

without womanly contours as yet.  He went up to her and said,

"Marty, why did you write that on my wall last night?  It WAS you,

you know."



"Because it was the truth.  I didn't mean to let it stay, Mr. 

Winterborne; but when I was going to rub it out you came, and I

was obliged to run off."



"Having prophesied one thing, why did you alter it to another?

Your predictions can't be worth much."



"I have not altered it."



"But you have."



"No."



"It is altered.  Go and see."



She went, and read that, in spite of losing his dwelling-place, he

would KEEP his Grace.  Marty came back surprised.



"Well, I never," she said.  "Who can have made such nonsense of

it?"



"Who, indeed?" said he.



"I have rubbed it all out, as the point of it is quite gone."



"You'd no business to rub it out.  I didn't tell you to.  I meant

to let it stay a little longer."



"Some idle boy did it, no doubt," she murmured.



As this seemed very probable, and the actual perpetrator was

unsuspected, Winterborne said no more, and dismissed the matter

from his mind.



From this day of his life onward for a considerable time,

Winterborne, though not absolutely out of his house as yet,

retired into the background of human life and action thereabout--a

feat not particularly difficult of performance anywhere when the

doer has the assistance of a lost prestige.  Grace, thinking that

Winterborne saw her write, made no further sign, and the frail

bark of fidelity that she had thus timidly launched was stranded

and lost.
