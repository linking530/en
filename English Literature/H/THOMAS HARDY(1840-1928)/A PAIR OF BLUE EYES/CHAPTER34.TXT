'Yea, happy shall he be that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.'





Sixteen hours had passed.  Knight was entering the ladies' boudoir

at The Crags, upon his return from attending the inquest touching

the death of Mrs. Jethway.  Elfride was not in the apartment.



Mrs. Swancourt made a few inquiries concerning the verdict and

collateral circumstances.  Then she said--



'The postman came this morning the minute after you left the

house.  There was only one letter for you, and I have it here.'



She took a letter from the lid of her workbox, and handed it to

him.  Knight took the missive abstractedly, but struck by its

appearance murmured a few words and left the room.



The letter was fastened with a black seal, and the handwriting in

which it was addressed had lain under his eyes, long and

prominently, only the evening before.



Knight was greatly agitated, and looked about for a spot where he

might be secure from interruption.  It was the season of heavy

dews, which lay on the herbage in shady places all the day long;

nevertheless, he entered a small patch of neglected grass-plat

enclosed by the shrubbery, and there perused the letter, which he

had opened on his way thither.



The handwriting, the seal, the paper, the introductory words, all

had told on the instant that the letter had come to him from the

hands of the widow Jethway, now dead and cold.  He had instantly

understood that the unfinished notes which caught his eye

yesternight were intended for nobody but himself.  He had

remembered some of the words of Elfride in her sleep on the

steamer, that somebody was not to tell him of something, or it

would be her ruin--a circumstance hitherto deemed so trivial and

meaningless that he had well-nigh forgotten it.  All these things

infused into him an emotion intense in power and supremely

distressing in quality.  The paper in his hand quivered as he

read:





                           'THE VALLEY, ENDELSTOW.



'SIR,--A woman who has not much in the world to lose by any

censure this act may bring upon her, wishes to give you some hints

concerning a lady you love.  If you will deign to accept a warning

before it is too late, you will notice what your correspondent has

to say.



'You are deceived.  Can such a woman as this be worthy?



'One who encouraged an honest youth to love her, then slighted

him, so that he died.



'One who next took a man of no birth as a lover, who was forbidden

the house by her father.



'One who secretly left her home to be married to that man, met

him, and went with him to London.



'One who, for some reason or other, returned again unmarried.



'One who, in her after-correspondence with him, went so far as to

address him as her husband.



'One who wrote the enclosed letter to ask me, who better than

anybody else knows the story, to keep the scandal a secret.



'I hope soon to be beyond the reach of either blame or praise.

But before removing me God has put it in my power to avenge the

death of my son.



                               'GERTRUDE JETHWAY.'





The letter enclosed was the note in pencil that Elfride had

written in Mrs. Jethway's cottage:





'DEAR MRS. JETHWAY,--I have been to visit you.  I wanted much to

see you, but I cannot wait any longer.  I came to beg you not to

execute the threats you have repeated to me.  Do not, I beseech

you, Mrs. Jethway, let any one know I ran away from home! It would

ruin me with him, and break my heart.  I will do anything for you,

if you will be kind to me.  In the name of our common womanhood,

do not, I implore you, make a scandal of me.--Yours,

                                   'E.  SWANCOURT.





Knight turned his head wearily towards the house.  The ground rose

rapidly on nearing the shrubbery in which he stood, raising it

almost to a level with the first floor of The Crags.  Elfride's

dressing-room lay in the salient angle in this direction, and it

was lighted by two windows in such a position that, from Knight's

standing-place, his sight passed through both windows, and raked

the room.  Elfride was there; she was pausing between the two

windows, looking at her figure in the cheval-glass.  She regarded

herself long and attentively in front; turned, flung back her

head, and observed the reflection over her shoulder.



Nobody can predicate as to her object or fancy; she may have done

the deed in the very abstraction of deep sadness.  She may have

been moaning from the bottom of her heart, 'How unhappy am I!' But

the impression produced on Knight was not a good one.  He dropped

his eyes moodily.  The dead woman's letter had a virtue in the

accident of its juncture far beyond any it intrinsically

exhibited.  Circumstance lent to evil words a ring of pitiless

justice echoing from the grave.  Knight could not endure their

possession.  He tore the letter into fragments.



He heard a brushing among the bushes behind, and turning his head

he saw Elfride following him.  The fair girl looked in his face

with a wistful smile of hope, too forcedly hopeful to displace the

firmly established dread beneath it.  His severe words of the

previous night still sat heavy upon her.



'I saw you from my window, Harry,' she said timidly.



'The dew will make your feet wet,' he observed, as one deaf.



'I don't mind it.'



'There is danger in getting wet feet.'



'Yes...Harry, what is the matter?'



'Oh, nothing.  Shall I resume the serious conversation I had with

you last night? No, perhaps not; perhaps I had better not.'



'Oh, I cannot tell! How wretched it all is! Ah, I wish you were

your own dear self again, and had kissed me when I came up! Why

didn't you ask me for one? why don't you now?'



'Too free in manner by half,' he heard murmur the voice within

him.



'It was that hateful conversation last night,' she went on.  'Oh,

those words! Last night was a black night for me.'



'Kiss!--I hate that word! Don't talk of kissing, for God's sake! I

should think you might with advantage have shown tact enough to

keep back that word "kiss," considering those you have accepted.'



She became very pale, and a rigid and desolate charactery took

possession of her face.  That face was so delicate and tender in

appearance now, that one could fancy the pressure of a finger upon

it would cause a livid spot.



Knight walked on, and Elfride with him, silent and unopposing.  He

opened a gate, and they entered a path across a stubble-field.



'Perhaps I intrude upon you?' she said as he closed the gate.

'Shall I go away?'



'No.  Listen to me, Elfride.' Knight's voice was low and unequal.

'I have been honest with you: will you be so with me? If any--

strange--connection has existed between yourself and a predecessor

of mine, tell it now.  It is better that I know it now, even

though the knowledge should part us, than that I should discover

it in time to come.  And suspicions have been awakened in me.  I

think I will not say how, because I despise the means.  A

discovery of any mystery of your past would embitter our lives.'



Knight waited with a slow manner of calmness.  His eyes were sad

and imperative.  They went farther along the path.



'Will you forgive me if I tell you all?' she exclaimed

entreatingly.



'I can't promise; so much depends upon what you have to tell.'



Elfride could not endure the silence which followed.



'Are you not going to love me?' she burst out.  'Harry, Harry,

love me, and speak as usual! Do; I beseech you, Harry!'



'Are you going to act fairly by me?' said Knight, with rising

anger; 'or are you not? What have I done to you that I should be

put off like this? Be caught like a bird in a springe; everything

intended to be hidden from me! Why is it, Elfride? That's what I

ask you.'



In their agitation they had left the path, and were wandering

among the wet and obstructive stubble, without knowing or heeding

it.



'What have I done?' she faltered.



'What? How can you ask what, when you know so well? You KNOW that

I have designedly been kept in ignorance of something attaching to

you, which, had I known of it, might have altered all my conduct;

and yet you say, what?'



She drooped visibly, and made no answer.



'Not that I believe in malicious letter-writers and whisperers;

not I.  I don't know whether I do or don't: upon my soul, I can't

tell.  I know this: a religion was building itself upon you in my

heart.  I looked into your eyes, and thought I saw there truth and

innocence as pure and perfect as ever embodied by God in the flesh

of woman.  Perfect truth is too much to expect, but ordinary truth

I WILL HAVE or nothing at all.  Just say, then; is the matter you

keep back of the gravest importance, or is it not?'



'I don't understand all your meaning.  If I have hidden anything

from you, it has been because I loved you so, and I feared--

feared--to lose you.'



'Since you are not given to confidence, I want to ask you some

plain questions.  Have I your permission?'



'Yes,' she said, and there came over her face a weary resignation.

'Say the harshest words you can; I will bear them!'



'There is a scandal in the air concerning you, Elfride; and I

cannot even combat it without knowing definitely what it is.  It

may not refer to you entirely, or even at all.' Knight trifled in

the very bitterness of his feeling.  'In the time of the French

Revolution, Pariseau, a ballet-master, was beheaded by mistake for

Parisot, a captain of the King's Guard.  I wish there was another

"E. Swancourt" in the neighbourhood.  Look at this.'



He handed her the letter she had written and left on the table at

Mrs. Jethway's.  She looked over it vacantly.



'It is not so much as it seems!' she pleaded.  'It seems wickedly

deceptive to look at now, but it had a much more natural origin

than you think.  My sole wish was not to endanger our love.  O

Harry! that was all my idea.  It was not much harm.'



'Yes, yes; but independently of the poor miserable creature's

remarks, it seems to imply--something wrong.'



'What remarks?'



'Those she wrote me--now torn to pieces.  Elfride, DID you run

away with a man you loved?--that was the damnable statement.  Has

such an accusation life in it--really, truly, Elfride?'



'Yes,' she whispered.



Knight's countenance sank.  'To be married to him?' came huskily

from his lips.



'Yes.  Oh, forgive me! I had never seen you, Harry.'



'To London?'



'Yes; but I----'



'Answer my questions; say nothing else, Elfride Did you ever

deliberately try to marry him in secret?'



'No; not deliberately.'



'But did you do it?'



A feeble red passed over her face.



'Yes,' she said.



'And after that--did you--write to him as your husband; and did he

address you as his wife?'



'Listen, listen! It was----'



'Do answer me; only answer me!'



'Then, yes, we did.' Her lips shook; but it was with some little

dignity that she continued: 'I would gladly have told you; for I

knew and know I had done wrong.  But I dared not; I loved you too

well.  Oh, so well! You have been everything in the world to me--

and you are now.  Will you not forgive me?'



It is a melancholy thought, that men who at first will not allow

the verdict of perfection they pronounce upon their sweethearts or

wives to be disturbed by God's own testimony to the contrary,

will, once suspecting their purity, morally hang them upon

evidence they would be ashamed to admit in judging a dog.



The reluctance to tell, which arose from Elfride's simplicity in

thinking herself so much more culpable than she really was, had

been doing fatal work in Knight's mind.  The man of many ideas,

now that his first dream of impossible things was over, vibrated

too far in the contrary direction; and her every movement of

feature--every tremor--every confused word--was taken as so much

proof of her unworthiness.



'Elfride, we must bid good-bye to compliment,' said Knight: 'we

must do without politeness now.  Look in my face, and as you

believe in God above, tell me truly one thing more.  Were you away

alone with him?'



'Yes.'



'Did you return home the same day on which you left it?'



'No.'



The word fell like a bolt, and the very land and sky seemed to

suffer.  Knight turned aside.  Meantime Elfride's countenance wore

a look indicating utter despair of being able to explain matters

so that they would seem no more than they really were,--a despair

which not only relinquishes the hope of direct explanation, but

wearily gives up all collateral chances of extenuation.



The scene was engraved for years on the retina of Knight's eye:

the dead and brown stubble, the weeds among it, the distant belt

of beeches shutting out the view of the house, the leaves of which

were now red and sick to death.



'You must forget me,' he said.  'We shall not marry, Elfride.'



How much anguish passed into her soul at those words from him was

told by the look of supreme torture she wore.



'What meaning have you, Harry? You only say so, do you?'



She looked doubtingly up at him, and tried to laugh, as if the

unreality of his words must be unquestionable.



'You are not in earnest, I know--I hope you are not? Surely I

belong to you, and you are going to keep me for yours?'



'Elfride, I have been speaking too roughly to you; I have said

what I ought only to have thought.  I like you; and let me give

you a word of advice.  Marry your man as soon as you can.  However

weary of each other you may feel, you belong to each other, and I

am not going to step between you.  Do you think I would--do you

think I could for a moment? If you cannot marry him now, and

another makes you his wife, do not reveal this secret to him after

marriage, if you do not before.  Honesty would be damnation then.'



Bewildered by his expressions, she exclaimed--



'No, no; I will not be a wife unless I am yours; and I must be

yours!'



'If we had married----'



'But you don't MEAN--that--that--you will go away and leave me,

and not be anything more to me--oh, you don't!'



Convulsive sobs took all nerve out of her utterance.  She checked

them, and continued to look in his face for the ray of hope that

was not to be found there.



'I am going indoors,' said Knight.  'You will not follow me,

Elfride; I wish you not to.'



'Oh no; indeed, I will not.'



'And then I am going to Castle Boterel.  Good-bye.'



He spoke the farewell as if it were but for the day--lightly, as

he had spoken such temporary farewells many times before--and she

seemed to understand it as such.  Knight had not the power to tell

her plainly that he was going for ever; he hardly knew for certain

that he was: whether he should rush back again upon the current of

an irresistible emotion, or whether he could sufficiently conquer

himself, and her in him, to establish that parting as a supreme

farewell, and present himself to the world again as no woman's.



Ten minutes later he had left the house, leaving directions that

if he did not return in the evening his luggage was to be sent to

his chambers in London, whence he intended to write to Mr.

Swancourt as to the reasons of his sudden departure.  He descended

the valley, and could not forbear turning his head.  He saw the

stubble-field, and a slight girlish figure in the midst of it--up

against the sky.  Elfride, docile as ever, had hardly moved a

step, for he had said, Remain.  He looked and saw her again--he

saw her for weeks and months.  He withdrew his eyes from the

scene, swept his hand across them, as if to brush away the sight,

breathed a low groan, and went on.
