      'A violet in the youth of primy nature,

       Forward, not permanent, sweet not lasting,

       The perfume and suppliance of a minute;

       No more.'





PREFACE



The following chapters were written at a time when the craze for

indiscriminate church-restoration had just reached the remotest

nooks of western England, where the wild and tragic features of

the coast had long combined in perfect harmony with the crude

Gothic Art of the ecclesiastical buildings scattered along it,

throwing into extraordinary discord all architectural attempts at

newness there.  To restore the grey carcases of a mediaevalism

whose spirit had fled, seemed a not less incongruous act than to

set about renovating the adjoining crags themselves.



Hence it happened that an imaginary history of three human hearts,

whose emotions were not without correspondence with these material

circumstances, found in the ordinary incidents of such church-

renovations a fitting frame for its presentation.



The shore and country about 'Castle Boterel' is now getting well

known, and will be readily recognized.  The spot is, I may add,

the furthest westward of all those convenient corners wherein I

have ventured to erect my theatre for these imperfect little

dramas of country life and passions; and it lies near to, or no

great way beyond, the vague border of the Wessex kingdom on that

side, which, like the westering verge of modern American

settlements, was progressive and uncertain.



This, however, is of little importance.  The place is pre-

eminently (for one person at least) the region of dream and

mystery.  The ghostly birds, the pall-like sea, the frothy wind,

the eternal soliloquy of the waters, the bloom of dark purple

cast, that seems to exhale from the shoreward precipices, in

themselves lend to the scene an atmosphere like the twilight of a

night vision.



One enormous sea-bord cliff in particular figures in the

narrative; and for some forgotten reason or other this cliff was

described in the story as being without a name.  Accuracy would

require the statement to be that a remarkable cliff which

resembles in many points the cliff of the description bears a name

that no event has made famous.
