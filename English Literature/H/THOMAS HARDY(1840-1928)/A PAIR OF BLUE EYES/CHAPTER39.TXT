'Each to the loved one's side.'





The friends and rivals breakfasted together the next morning.  Not

a word was said on either side upon the matter discussed the

previous evening so glibly and so hollowly.  Stephen was absorbed

the greater part of the time in wishing he were not forced to stay

in town yet another day.



'I don't intend to leave for St. Launce's till to-morrow, as you

know,' he said to Knight at the end of the meal.  'What are you

going to do with yourself to-day?'



'I have an engagement just before ten,' said Knight deliberately;

'and after that time I must call upon two or three people.'



'I'll look for you this evening,' said Stephen.



'Yes, do.  You may as well come and dine with me; that is, if we

can meet.  I may not sleep in London to-night; in fact, I am

absolutely unsettled as to my movements yet.  However, the first

thing I am going to do is to get my baggage shifted from this

place to Bede's Inn.  Good-bye for the present.  I'll write, you

know, if I can't meet you.'



It now wanted a quarter to nine o'clock.  When Knight was gone,

Stephen felt yet more impatient of the circumstance that another

day would have to drag itself away wearily before he could set out

for that spot of earth whereon a soft thought of him might perhaps

be nourished still.  On a sudden he admitted to his mind the

possibility that the engagement he was waiting in town to keep

might be postponed without much harm.



It was no sooner perceived than attempted.  Looking at his watch,

he found it wanted forty minutes to the departure of the ten

o'clock train from Paddington, which left him a surplus quarter of

an hour before it would be necessary to start for the station.



Scribbling a hasty note or two--one putting off the business

meeting, another to Knight apologizing for not being able to see

him in the evening--paying his bill, and leaving his heavier

luggage to follow him by goods-train, he jumped into a cab and

rattled off to the Great Western Station.



Shortly afterwards he took his seat in the railway carriage.



The guard paused on his whistle, to let into the next compartment

to Smith's a man of whom Stephen had caught but a hasty glimpse as

he ran across the platform at the last moment.



Smith sank back into the carriage, stilled by perplexity.  The man

was like Knight--astonishingly like him.  Was it possible it could

be he? To have got there he must have driven like the wind to

Bede's Inn, and hardly have alighted before starting again.  No,

it could not be he; that was not his way of doing things.



During the early part of the journey Stephen Smith's thoughts

busied themselves till his brain seemed swollen.  One subject was

concerning his own approaching actions.  He was a day earlier than

his letter to his parents had stated, and his arrangement with

them had been that they should meet him at Plymouth; a plan which

pleased the worthy couple beyond expression.  Once before the same

engagement had been made, which he had then quashed by ante-dating

his arrival.  This time he would go right on to Castle Boterel;

ramble in that well-known neighbourhood during the evening and

next morning, making inquiries; and return to Plymouth to meet

them as arranged--a contrivance which would leave their cherished

project undisturbed, relieving his own impatience also.



At Chippenham there was a little waiting, and some loosening and

attaching of carriages.



Stephen looked out.  At the same moment another man's head emerged

from the adjoining window.  Each looked in the other's face.



Knight and Stephen confronted one another.



'You here!' said the younger man.



'Yes.  It seems that you are too,' said Knight, strangely.



'Yes.'



The selfishness of love and the cruelty of jealousy were fairly

exemplified at this moment.  Each of the two men looked at his

friend as he had never looked at him before.  Each was TROUBLED at

the other's presence.



'I thought you said you were not coming till to-morrow,' remarked

Knight.



'I did.  It was an afterthought to come to-day.  This journey was

your engagement, then?'



'No, it was not.  This is an afterthought of mine too.  I left a

note to explain it, and account for my not being able to meet you

this evening as we arranged.'



'So did I for you.'



'You don't look well: you did not this morning.'



'I have a headache.  You are paler to-day than you were.'



'I, too, have been suffering from headache.  We have to wait here

a few minutes, I think.'



They walked up and down the platform, each one more and more

embarrassingly concerned with the awkwardness of his friend's

presence.  They reached the end of the footway, and paused in

sheer absent-mindedness.  Stephen's vacant eyes rested upon the

operations of some porters, who were shifting a dark and curious-

looking van from the rear of the train, to shunt another which was

between it and the fore part of the train.  This operation having

been concluded, the two friends returned to the side of their

carriage.



'Will you come in here?' said Knight, not very warmly.



'I have my rug and portmanteau and umbrella with me: it is rather

bothering to move now,' said Stephen reluctantly.  'Why not you

come here?'



'I have my traps too.  It is hardly worth while to shift them, for

I shall see you again, you know.'



'Oh, yes.'



And each got into his own place.  Just at starting, a man on the

platform held up his hands and stopped the train.



Stephen looked out to see what was the matter.



One of the officials was exclaiming to another, 'That carriage

should have been attached again.  Can't you see it is for the main

line? Quick! What fools there are in the world!'



'What a confounded nuisance these stoppages are!' exclaimed Knight

impatiently, looking out from his compartment.  'What is it?'



'That singular carriage we saw has been unfastened from our train

by mistake, it seems,' said Stephen.



He was watching the process of attaching it.  The van or carriage,

which he now recognized as having seen at Paddington before they

started, was rich and solemn rather than gloomy in aspect.  It

seemed to be quite new, and of modern design, and its impressive

personality attracted the notice of others beside himself.  He

beheld it gradually wheeled forward by two men on each side:

slower and more sadly it seemed to approach: then a slight

concussion, and they were connected with it, and off again.



Stephen sat all the afternoon pondering upon the reason of

Knight's unexpected reappearance.  Was he going as far as Castle

Boterel? If so, he could only have one object in view--a visit to

Elfride.  And what an idea it seemed!



At Plymouth Smith partook of a little refreshment, and then went

round to the side from which the train started for Camelton, the

new station near Castle Boterel and Endelstow.



Knight was already there.



Stephen walked up and stood beside him without speaking.  Two men

at this moment crept out from among the wheels of the waiting

train.



'The carriage is light enough,' said one in a grim tone.  'Light

as vanity; full of nothing.'



'Nothing in size, but a good deal in signification,' said the

other, a man of brighter mind and manners.



Smith then perceived that to their train was attached that same

carriage of grand and dark aspect which had haunted them all the

way from London.



'You are going on, I suppose?' said Knight, turning to Stephen,

after idly looking at the same object.



'Yes.'



'We may as well travel together for the remaining distance, may we

not?'



'Certainly we will;' and they both entered the same door.



Evening drew on apace.  It chanced to be the eve of St.

Valentine's--that bishop of blessed memory to youthful lovers--and

the sun shone low under the rim of a thick hard cloud, decorating

the eminences of the landscape with crowns of orange fire.  As the

train changed its direction on a curve, the same rays stretched in

through the window, and coaxed open Knight's half-closed eyes.



'You will get out at St. Launce's, I suppose?' he murmured.



'No,' said Stephen, 'I am not expected till to-morrow.' Knight was

silent.



'And you--are you going to Endelstow?' said the younger man

pointedly.



'Since you ask, I can do no less than say I am, Stephen,'

continued Knight slowly, and with more resolution of manner than

he had shown all the day.  'I am going to Endelstow to see if

Elfride Swancourt is still free; and if so, to ask her to be my

wife.'



'So am I,' said Stephen Smith.



'I think you'll lose your labour,' Knight returned with decision.



'Naturally you do.' There was a strong accent of bitterness in

Stephen's voice.  'You might have said HOPE instead of THINK,' he

added.



'I might have done no such thing.  I gave you my opinion.  Elfride

Swancourt may have loved you once, no doubt, but it was when she

was so young that she hardly knew her own mind.'



'Thank you,' said Stephen laconically.  'She knew her mind as well

as I did.  We are the same age.  If you hadn't interfered----'



'Don't say that--don't say it, Stephen! How can you make out that

I interfered? Be just, please!'



'Well,' said his friend, 'she was mine before she was yours--you

know that! And it seemed a hard thing to find you had got her, and

that if it had not been for you, all might have turned out well

for me.' Stephen spoke with a swelling heart, and looked out of

the window to hide the emotion that would make itself visible upon

his face.



'It is absurd,' said Knight in a kinder tone, 'for you to look at

the matter in that light.  What I tell you is for your good.  You

naturally do not like to realize the truth--that her liking for

you was only a girl's first fancy, which has no root ever.'



'It is not true!' said Stephen passionately.  'It was you put me

out.  And now you'll be pushing in again between us, and depriving

me of my chance again! My right, that's what it is! How ungenerous

of you to come anew and try to take her away from me! When you had

won her, I did not interfere; and you might, I think, Mr. Knight,

do by me as I did by you!'



'Don't "Mr." me; you are as well in the world as I am now.'



'First love is deepest; and that was mine.'



'Who told you that?' said Knight superciliously.



'I had her first love.  And it was through me that you and she

parted.  I can guess that well enough.'



'It was.  And if I were to explain to you in what way that

operated in parting us, I should convince you that you do quite

wrong in intruding upon her--that, as I said at first, your labour

will be lost.  I don't choose to explain, because the particulars

are painful.  But if you won't listen to me, go on, for Heaven's

sake.  I don't care what you do, my boy.'



'You have no right to domineer over me as you do.  Just because,

when I was a lad, I was accustomed to look up to you as a master,

and you helped me a little, for which I was grateful to you and

have loved you, you assume too much now, and step in before me.

It is cruel--it is unjust--of you to injure me so!'



Knight showed himself keenly hurt at this.  'Stephen, those words

are untrue and unworthy of any man, and they are unworthy of you.

You know you wrong me.  If you have ever profited by any

instruction of mine, I am only too glad to know it.  You know it

was given ungrudgingly, and that I have never once looked upon it

as making you in any way a debtor to me.'



Stephen's naturally gentle nature was touched, and it was in a

troubled voice that he said, 'Yes, yes.  I am unjust in that--I

own it.'



'This is St. Launce's Station, I think.  Are you going to get

out?'



Knight's manner of returning to the matter in hand drew Stephen

again into himself.  'No; I told you I was going to Endelstow,' he

resolutely replied.



Knight's features became impassive, and he said no more.  The

train continued rattling on, and Stephen leant back in his corner

and closed his eyes.  The yellows of evening had turned to browns,

the dusky shades thickened, and a flying cloud of dust

occasionally stroked the window--borne upon a chilling breeze

which blew from the north-east.  The previously gilded but now

dreary hills began to lose their daylight aspects of rotundity,

and to become black discs vandyked against the sky, all nature

wearing the cloak that six o'clock casts over the landscape at

this time of the year.



Stephen started up in bewilderment after a long stillness, and it

was some time before he recollected himself.



'Well, how real, how real!' he exclaimed, brushing his hand across

his eyes.



'What is?' said Knight.



'That dream.  I fell asleep for a few minutes, and have had a

dream--the most vivid I ever remember.'



He wearily looked out into the gloom.  They were now drawing near

to Camelton.  The lighting of the lamps was perceptible through

the veil of evening--each flame starting into existence at

intervals, and blinking weakly against the gusts of wind.



'What did you dream?' said Knight moodily.



'Oh, nothing to be told.  'Twas a sort of incubus.  There is never

anything in dreams.'



'I hardly supposed there was.'



'I know that.  However, what I so vividly dreamt was this, since

you would like to hear.  It was the brightest of bright mornings

at East Endelstow Church, and you and I stood by the font.  Far

away in the chancel Lord Luxellian was standing alone, cold and

impassive, and utterly unlike his usual self: but I knew it was

he.  Inside the altar rail stood a strange clergyman with his book

open.  He looked up and said to Lord Luxellian, "Where's the

bride?" Lord Luxellian said, "There's no bride." At that moment

somebody came in at the door, and I knew her to be Lady Luxellian

who died.  He turned and said to her, "I thought you were in the

vault below us; but that could have only been a dream of mine.

Come on." Then she came on.  And in brushing between us she

chilled me so with cold that I exclaimed, "The life is gone out of

me!" and, in the way of dreams, I awoke.  But here we are at

Camelton.'



They were slowly entering the station.



'What are you going to do?' said Knight.  'Do you really intend to

call on the Swancourts?'



'By no means.  I am going to make inquiries first.  I shall stay

at the Luxellian Arms to-night.  You will go right on to

Endelstow, I suppose, at once?'



'I can hardly do that at this time of the day.  Perhaps you are

not aware that the family--her father, at any rate--is at variance

with me as much as with you.



'I didn't know it.'



'And that I cannot rush into the house as an old friend any more

than you can.  Certainly I have the privileges of a distant

relationship, whatever they may be.'



Knight let down the window, and looked ahead.  'There are a great

many people at the station,' he said.  'They seem all to be on the

look-out for us.'



When the train stopped, the half-estranged friends could perceive

by the lamplight that the assemblage of idlers enclosed as a

kernel a group of men in black cloaks.  A side gate in the

platform railing was open, and outside this stood a dark vehicle,

which they could not at first characterize.  Then Knight saw on

its upper part forms against the sky like cedars by night, and

knew the vehicle to be a hearse.  Few people were at the carriage

doors to meet the passengers--the majority had congregated at this

upper end.  Knight and Stephen alighted, and turned for a moment

in the same direction.



The sombre van, which had accompanied them all day from London,

now began to reveal that their destination was also its own.  It

had been drawn up exactly opposite the open gate.  The bystanders

all fell back, forming a clear lane from the gateway to the van,

and the men in cloaks entered the latter conveyance.



'They are labourers, I fancy,' said Stephen.  'Ah, it is strange;

but I recognize three of them as Endelstow men.  Rather remarkable

this.'



Presently they began to come out, two and two; and under the rays

of the lamp they were seen to bear between them a light-coloured

coffin of satin-wood, brightly polished, and without a nail.  The

eight men took the burden upon their shoulders, and slowly crossed

with it over to the gate.



Knight and Stephen went outside, and came close to the procession

as it moved off.  A carriage belonging to the cortege turned round

close to a lamp.  The rays shone in upon the face of the vicar of

Endelstow, Mr. Swancourt--looking many years older than when they

had last seen him.  Knight and Stephen involuntarily drew back.



Knight spoke to a bystander.  'What has Mr. Swancourt to do with

that funeral?'



'He is the lady's father,' said the bystander.



'What lady's father?' said Knight, in a voice so hollow that the

man stared at him.



'The father of the lady in the coffin.  She died in London, you

know, and has been brought here by this train.  She is to be taken

home to-night, and buried to-morrow.'



Knight stood staring blindly at where the hearse had been; as if

he saw it, or some one, there.  Then he turned, and beheld the

lithe form of Stephen bowed down like that of an old man.  He took

his young friend's arm, and led him away from the light.
