'Beneath the shelter of an aged tree.'





Stephen retraced his steps towards the cottage he had visited only

two or three hours previously.  He drew near and under the rich

foliage growing about the outskirts of Endelstow Park, the spotty

lights and shades from the shining moon maintaining a race over

his head and down his back in an endless gambol.  When he crossed

the plank bridge and entered the garden-gate, he saw an

illuminated figure coming from the enclosed plot towards the house

on the other side.  It was his father, with his hand in a sling,

taking a general moonlight view of the garden, and particularly of

a plot of the youngest of young turnips, previous to closing the

cottage for the night.



He saluted his son with customary force.  'Hallo, Stephen! We

should ha' been in bed in another ten minutes.  Come to see what's

the matter wi' me, I suppose, my lad?'



The doctor had come and gone, and the hand had been pronounced as

injured but slightly, though it might possibly have been

considered a far more serious case if Mr. Smith had been a more

important man.  Stephen's anxious inquiry drew from his father

words of regret at the inconvenience to the world of his doing

nothing for the next two days, rather than of concern for the pain

of the accident.  Together they entered the house.



John Smith--brown as autumn as to skin, white as winter as to

clothes--was a satisfactory specimen of the village artificer in

stone.  In common with most rural mechanics, he had too much

individuality to be a typical 'working-man'--a resultant of that

beach-pebble attrition with his kind only to be experienced in

large towns, which metamorphoses the unit Self into a fraction of

the unit Class.



There was not the speciality in his labour which distinguishes the

handicraftsmen of towns.  Though only a mason, strictly speaking,

he was not above handling a brick, if bricks were the order of the

day; or a slate or tile, if a roof had to be covered before the

wet weather set in, and nobody was near who could do it better.

Indeed, on one or two occasions in the depth of winter, when frost

peremptorily forbids all use of the trowel, making foundations to

settle, stones to fly, and mortar to crumble, he had taken to

felling and sawing trees.  Moreover, he had practised gardening in

his own plot for so many years that, on an emergency, he might

have made a living by that calling.



Probably our countryman was not such an accomplished artificer in

a particular direction as his town brethren in the trades.  But he

was, in truth, like that clumsy pin-maker who made the whole pin,

and who was despised by Adam Smith on that account and respected

by Macaulay, much more the artist nevertheless.



Appearing now, indoors, by the light of the candle, his stalwart

healthiness was a sight to see.  His beard was close and knotted

as that of a chiselled Hercules; his shirt sleeves were partly

rolled up, his waistcoat unbuttoned; the difference in hue between

the snowy linen and the ruddy arms and face contrasting like the

white of an egg and its yolk.  Mrs. Smith, on hearing them enter,

advanced from the pantry.



Mrs. Smith was a matron whose countenance addressed itself to the

mind rather than to the eye, though not exclusively.  She retained

her personal freshness even now, in the prosy afternoon-time of

her life; but what her features were primarily indicative of was a

sound common sense behind them; as a whole, appearing to carry

with them a sort of argumentative commentary on the world in

general.



The details of the accident were then rehearsed by Stephen's

father, in the dramatic manner also common to Martin Cannister,

other individuals of the neighbourhood, and the rural world

generally.  Mrs. Smith threw in her sentiments between the acts,

as Coryphaeus of the tragedy, to make the description complete.

The story at last came to an end, as the longest will, and Stephen

directed the conversation into another channel.



'Well, mother, they know everything about me now,' he said

quietly.



'Well done!' replied his father; 'now my mind's at peace.'



'I blame myself--I never shall forgive myself--for not telling

them before,' continued the young man.



Mrs. Smith at this point abstracted her mind from the former

subject.  'I don't see what you have to grieve about, Stephen,'

she said.  'People who accidentally get friends don't, as a first

stroke, tell the history of their families.'



'Ye've done no wrong, certainly,' said his father.



'No; but I should have spoken sooner.  There's more in this visit

of mine than you think--a good deal more.'



'Not more than I think,' Mrs. Smith replied, looking

contemplatively at him.  Stephen blushed; and his father looked

from one to the other in a state of utter incomprehension.



'She's a pretty piece enough,' Mrs. Smith continued, 'and very

lady-like and clever too.  But though she's very well fit for you

as far as that is, why, mercy 'pon me, what ever do you want any

woman at all for yet?'



John made his naturally short mouth a long one, and wrinkled his

forehead, 'That's the way the wind d'blow, is it?' he said.



'Mother,' exclaimed Stephen, 'how absurdly you speak! Criticizing

whether she's fit for me or no, as if there were room for doubt on

the matter! Why, to marry her would be the great blessing of my

life--socially and practically, as well as in other respects.  No

such good fortune as that, I'm afraid; she's too far above me.

Her family doesn't want such country lads as I in it.'



'Then if they don't want you, I'd see them dead corpses before I'd

want them, and go to better families who do want you.'



'Ah, yes; but I could never put up with the distaste of being

welcomed among such people as you mean, whilst I could get

indifference among such people as hers.'



'What crazy twist o' thinking will enter your head next?' said his

mother.  'And come to that, she's not a bit too high for you, or

you too low for her.  See how careful I be to keep myself up.  I'm

sure I never stop for more than a minute together to talk to any

journeymen people; and I never invite anybody to our party o'

Christmases who are not in business for themselves.  And I talk to

several toppermost carriage people that come to my lord's without

saying ma'am or sir to 'em, and they take it as quiet as lambs.'



'You curtseyed to the vicar, mother; and I wish you hadn't.'



'But it was before he called me by my Christian name, or he would

have got very little curtseying from me!' said Mrs. Smith,

bridling and sparkling with vexation.  'You go on at me, Stephen,

as if I were your worst enemy! What else could I do with the man

to get rid of him, banging it into me and your father by side and

by seam, about his greatness, and what happened when he was a

young fellow at college, and I don't know what-all; the tongue o'

en flopping round his mouth like a mop-rag round a dairy.  That 'a

did, didn't he, John?'



'That's about the size o't,' replied her husband.



'Every woman now-a-days,' resumed Mrs. Smith, 'if she marry at

all, must expect a father-in-law of a rank lower than her father.

The men have gone up so, and the women have stood still.  Every

man you meet is more the dand than his father; and you are just

level wi' her.'



'That's what she thinks herself.'



'It only shows her sense.  I knew she was after 'ee, Stephen--I

knew it.'



'After me! Good Lord, what next!'



'And I really must say again that you ought not to be in such a

hurry, and wait for a few years.  You might go higher than a

bankrupt pa'son's girl then.'



'The fact is, mother,' said Stephen impatiently, 'you don't know

anything about it.  I shall never go higher, because I don't want

to, nor should I if I lived to be a hundred.  As to you saying

that she's after me, I don't like such a remark about her, for it

implies a scheming woman, and a man worth scheming for, both of

which are not only untrue, but ludicrously untrue, of this case.

Isn't it so, father?'



'I'm afraid I don't understand the matter well enough to gie my

opinion,' said his father, in the tone of the fox who had a cold

and could not smell.



'She couldn't have been very backward anyhow, considering the

short time you have known her,' said his mother.  'Well I think

that five years hence you'll be plenty young enough to think of

such things.  And really she can very well afford to wait, and

will too, take my word.  Living down in an out-step place like

this, I am sure she ought to be very thankful that you took notice

of her.  She'd most likely have died an old maid if you hadn't

turned up.'



'All nonsense,' said Stephen, but not aloud.



'A nice little thing she is,' Mrs. Smith went on in a more

complacent tone now that Stephen had been talked down; 'there's

not a word to say against her, I'll own.  I see her sometimes

decked out like a horse going to fair, and I admire her for't.  A

perfect little lady.  But people can't help their thoughts, and if

she'd learnt to make figures instead of letters when she was at

school 'twould have been better for her pocket; for as I said,

there never were worse times for such as she than now.'



'Now, now, mother!' said Stephen with smiling deprecation.



'But I will!' said his mother with asperity.  'I don't read the

papers for nothing, and I know men all move up a stage by

marriage.  Men of her class, that is, parsons, marry squires'

daughters; squires marry lords' daughters; lords marry dukes'

daughters; dukes marry queens' daughters.  All stages of gentlemen

mate a stage higher; and the lowest stage of gentlewomen are left

single, or marry out of their class.'



'But you said just now, dear mother----' retorted Stephen, unable

to resist the temptation of showing his mother her inconsistency.

Then he paused.



'Well, what did I say?' And Mrs. Smith prepared her lips for a new

campaign.



Stephen, regretting that he had begun, since a volcano might be

the consequence, was obliged to go on.



'You said I wasn't out of her class just before.'



'Yes, there, there! That's you; that's my own flesh and blood.

I'll warrant that you'll pick holes in everything your mother

says, if you can, Stephen.  You are just like your father for

that; take anybody's part but mine.  Whilst I am speaking and

talking and trying and slaving away for your good, you are waiting

to catch me out in that way.  So you are in her class, but 'tis

what HER people would CALL marrying out of her class.  Don't be so

quarrelsome, Stephen!'



Stephen preserved a discreet silence, in which he was imitated by

his father, and for several minutes nothing was heard but the

ticking of the green-faced case-clock against the wall.



'I'm sure,' added Mrs. Smith in a more philosophic tone, and as a

terminative speech, 'if there'd been so much trouble to get a

husband in my time as there is in these days--when you must make a

god-almighty of a man to get en to hae ye--I'd have trod clay for

bricks before I'd ever have lowered my dignity to marry, or

there's no bread in nine loaves.'



The discussion now dropped, and as it was getting late, Stephen

bade his parents farewell for the evening, his mother none the

less warmly for their sparring; for although Mrs. Smith and

Stephen were always contending, they were never at enmity.



'And possibly,' said Stephen, 'I may leave here altogether to-

morrow; I don't know.  So that if I shouldn't call again before

returning to London, don't be alarmed, will you?'



'But didn't you come for a fortnight?' said his mother.  'And

haven't you a month's holiday altogether? They are going to turn

you out, then?'



'Not at all.  I may stay longer; I may go.  If I go, you had

better say nothing about my having been here, for her sake.  At

what time of the morning does the carrier pass Endelstow lane?'



'Seven o'clock.'




And then he left them.  His thoughts were, that should the vicar

permit him to become engaged, to hope for an engagement, or in any

way to think of his beloved Elfride, he might stay longer.  Should

he be forbidden to think of any such thing, he resolved to go at

once.  And the latter, even to young hopefulness, seemed the more

probable alternative.



Stephen walked back to the vicarage through the meadows, as he had

come, surrounded by the soft musical purl of the water through

little weirs, the modest light of the moon, the freshening smell

of the dews out-spread around.  It was a time when mere seeing is

meditation, and meditation peace.  Stephen was hardly philosopher

enough to avail himself of Nature's offer.  His constitution was

made up of very simple particulars; was one which, rare in the

spring-time of civilizations, seems to grow abundant as a nation

gets older, individuality fades, and education spreads; that is,

his brain had extraordinary receptive powers, and no great

creativeness.  Quickly acquiring any kind of knowledge he saw

around him, and having a plastic adaptability more common in woman

than in man, he changed colour like a chameleon as the society he

found himself in assumed a higher and more artificial tone.  He

had not many original ideas, and yet there was scarcely an idea to

which, under proper training, he could not have added a

respectable co-ordinate.



He saw nothing outside himself to-night; and what he saw within

was a weariness to his flesh.  Yet to a dispassionate observer,

his pretensions to Elfride, though rather premature, were far from

absurd as marriages go, unless the accidental proximity of simple

but honest parents could be said to make them so.



The clock struck eleven when he entered the house.  Elfride had

been waiting with scarcely a movement since he departed.  Before

he had spoken to her she caught sight of him passing into the

study with her father.  She saw that he had by some means obtained

the private interview he desired.



A nervous headache had been growing on the excitable girl during

the absence of Stephen, and now she could do nothing beyond going

up again to her room as she had done before.  Instead of lying

down she sat again in the darkness without closing the door, and

listened with a beating heart to every sound from downstairs.  The

servants had gone to bed.  She ultimately heard the two men come

from the study and cross to the dining-room, where supper had been

lingering for more than an hour.  The door was left open, and she

found that the meal, such as it was, passed off between her father

and her lover without any remark, save commonplaces as to

cucumbers and melons, their wholesomeness and culture, uttered in

a stiff and formal way.  It seemed to prefigure failure.



Shortly afterwards Stephen came upstairs to his bedroom, and was

almost immediately followed by her father, who also retired for

the night.  Not inclined to get a light, she partly undressed and

sat on the bed, where she remained in pained thought for some

time, possibly an hour.  Then rising to close her door previously

to fully unrobing, she saw a streak of light shining across the

landing.  Her father's door was shut, and he could be heard

snoring regularly.  The light came from Stephen's room, and the

slight sounds also coming thence emphatically denoted what he was

doing.  In the perfect silence she could hear the closing of a lid

and the clicking of a lock,--he was fastening his hat-box.  Then

the buckling of straps and the click of another key,--he was

securing his portmanteau.  With trebled foreboding she opened her

door softly, and went towards his.  One sensation pervaded her to

distraction.  Stephen, her handsome youth and darling, was going

away, and she might never see him again except in secret and in

sadness--perhaps never more.  At any rate, she could no longer

wait till the morning to hear the result of the interview, as she

had intended.  She flung her dressing-gown round her, tapped

lightly at his door, and whispered 'Stephen!' He came instantly,

opened the door, and stepped out.



'Tell me; are we to hope?'



He replied in a disturbed whisper, and a tear approached its

outlet, though none fell.



'I am not to think of such a preposterous thing--that's what he

said.  And I am going to-morrow.  I should have called you up to

bid you good-bye.'



'But he didn't say you were to go--O Stephen, he didn't say that?'



'No; not in words.  But I cannot stay.'



'Oh, don't, don't go! Do come and let us talk.  Let us come down

to the drawing-room for a few minutes; he will hear us here.'



She preceded him down the staircase with the taper light in her

hand, looking unnaturally tall and thin in the long dove-coloured

dressing-gown she wore.  She did not stop to think of the

propriety or otherwise of this midnight interview under such

circumstances.  She thought that the tragedy of her life was

beginning, and, for the first time almost, felt that her existence

might have a grave side, the shade of which enveloped and rendered

invisible the delicate gradations of custom and punctilio.

Elfride softly opened the drawing-room door and they both went in.

When she had placed the candle on the table, he enclosed her with

his arms, dried her eyes with his handkerchief, and kissed their

lids.



'Stephen, it is over--happy love is over; and there is no more

sunshine now!'



'I will make a fortune, and come to you, and have you.  Yes, I

will!'



'Papa will never hear of it--never--never! You don't know him.  I

do.  He is either biassed in favour of a thing, or prejudiced

against it.  Argument is powerless against either feeling.'



'No; I won't think of him so,' said Stephen.  'If I appear before

him some time hence as a man of established name, he will accept

me--I know he will.  He is not a wicked man.'



'No, he is not wicked.  But you say "some time hence," as if it

were no time.  To you, among bustle and excitement, it will be

comparatively a short time, perhaps; oh, to me, it will be its

real length trebled! Every summer will be a year--autumn a year--

winter a year! O Stephen! and you may forget me!'



Forget: that was, and is, the real sting of waiting to fond-

hearted woman.  The remark awoke in Stephen the converse fear.

'You, too, may be persuaded to give me up, when time has made me

fainter in your memory.  For, remember, your love for me must be

nourished in secret; there will be no long visits from me to

support you.  Circumstances will always tend to obliterate me.'



'Stephen,' she said, filled with her own misgivings, and unheeding

his last words, 'there are beautiful women where you live--of

course I know there are--and they may win you away from me.' Her

tears came visibly as she drew a mental picture of his

faithlessness.  'And it won't be your fault,' she continued,

looking into the candle with doleful eyes.  'No! You will think

that our family don't want you, and get to include me with them.

And there will be a vacancy in your heart, and some others will be

let in.'



'I could not, I would not.  Elfie, do not be so full of

forebodings.'



'Oh yes, they will,' she replied.  'And you will look at them, not

caring at first, and then you will look and be interested, and

after a while you will think, "Ah, they know all about city life,

and assemblies, and coteries, and the manners of the titled, and

poor little Elfie, with all the fuss that's made about her having

me, doesn't know about anything but a little house and a few

cliffs and a space of sea, far away." And then you'll be more

interested in them, and they'll make you have them instead of me,

on purpose to be cruel to me because I am silly, and they are

clever and hate me.  And I hate them, too; yes, I do!'



Her impulsive words had power to impress him at any rate with the

recognition of the uncertainty of all that is not accomplished.

And, worse than that general feeling, there of course remained the

sadness which arose from the special features of his own case.

However remote a desired issue may be, the mere fact of having

entered the groove which leads to it, cheers to some extent with a

sense of accomplishment.  Had Mr. Swancourt consented to an

engagement of no less length than ten years, Stephen would have

been comparatively cheerful in waiting; they would have felt that

they were somewhere on the road to Cupid's garden.  But, with a

possibility of a shorter probation, they had not as yet any

prospect of the beginning; the zero of hope had yet to be reached.

Mr. Swancourt would have to revoke his formidable words before the

waiting for marriage could even set in.  And this was despair.



'I wish we could marry now,' murmured Stephen, as an impossible

fancy.



'So do I,' said she also, as if regarding an idle dream.  ''Tis

the only thing that ever does sweethearts good!'



'Secretly would do, would it not, Elfie?'



'Yes, secretly would do; secretly would indeed be best,' she said,

and went on reflectively: 'All we want is to render it absolutely

impossible for any future circumstance to upset our future

intention of being happy together; not to begin being happy now.'



'Exactly,' he murmured in a voice and manner the counterpart of

hers.  'To marry and part secretly, and live on as we are living

now; merely to put it out of anybody's power to force you away

from me, dearest.'



'Or you away from me, Stephen.'



'Or me from you.  It is possible to conceive a force of

circumstance strong enough to make any woman in the world marry

against her will: no conceivable pressure, up to torture or

starvation, can make a woman once married to her lover anybody

else's wife.'



Now up to this point the idea of an immediate secret marriage had

been held by both as an untenable hypothesis, wherewith simply to

beguile a miserable moment.  During a pause which followed

Stephen's last remark, a fascinating perception, then an alluring

conviction, flashed along the brain of both.  The perception was

that an immediate marriage COULD be contrived; the conviction that

such an act, in spite of its daring, its fathomless results, its

deceptiveness, would be preferred by each to the life they must

lead under any other conditions.



The youth spoke first, and his voice trembled with the magnitude

of the conception he was cherishing.  'How strong we should feel,

Elfride! going on our separate courses as before, without the fear

of ultimate separation! O Elfride! think of it; think of it!'



It is certain that the young girl's love for Stephen received a

fanning from her father's opposition which made it blaze with a

dozen times the intensity it would have exhibited if left alone.

Never were conditions more favourable for developing a girl's

first passing fancy for a handsome boyish face--a fancy rooted in

inexperience and nourished by seclusion--into a wild unreflecting

passion fervid enough for anything.  All the elements of such a

development were there, the chief one being hopelessness--a

necessary ingredient always to perfect the mixture of feelings

united under the name of loving to distraction.



'We would tell papa soon, would we not?' she inquired timidly.

'Nobody else need know.  He would then be convinced that hearts

cannot be played with; love encouraged be ready to grow, love

discouraged be ready to die, at a moment's notice.  Stephen, do

you not think that if marriages against a parent's consent are

ever justifiable, they are when young people have been favoured up

to a point, as we have, and then have had that favour suddenly

withdrawn?'



'Yes.  It is not as if we had from the beginning acted in

opposition to your papa's wishes.  Only think, Elfie, how pleasant

he was towards me but six hours ago! He liked me, praised me,

never objected to my being alone with you.'



'I believe he MUST like you now,' she cried.  'And if he found

that you irremediably belonged to me, he would own it and help

you.  'O Stephen, Stephen,' she burst out again, as the

remembrance of his packing came afresh to her mind, 'I cannot bear

your going away like this! It is too dreadful.  All I have been

expecting miserably killed within me like this!'



Stephen flushed hot with impulse.  'I will not be a doubt to you--

thought of you shall not be a misery to me!' he said.  'We will be

wife and husband before we part for long!'



She hid her face on his shoulder.  'Anything to make SURE!' she

whispered.



'I did not like to propose it immediately,' continued Stephen.

'It seemed to me--it seems to me now--like trying to catch you--a

girl better in the world than I.'



'Not that, indeed! And am I better in worldly station? What's the

use of have beens? We may have been something once; we are nothing

now.'



Then they whispered long and earnestly together; Stephen

hesitatingly proposing this and that plan, Elfride modifying them,
