'A woman's way.'





Haggard cliffs, of every ugly altitude, are as common as sea-fowl

along the line of coast between Exmoor and Land's End; but this

outflanked and encompassed specimen was the ugliest of them all.

Their summits are not safe places for scientific experiment on the

principles of air-currents, as Knight had now found, to his

dismay.



He still clutched the face of the escarpment--not with the

frenzied hold of despair, but with a dogged determination to make

the most of his every jot of endurance, and so give the longest

possible scope to Elfride's intentions, whatever they might be.



He reclined hand in hand with the world in its infancy.  Not a

blade, not an insect, which spoke of the present, was between him

and the past. The inveterate antagonism of these black precipices

to all strugglers for life is in no way more forcibly suggested

than by the paucity of tufts of grass, lichens, or confervae on

their outermost ledges.



Knight pondered on the meaning of Elfride's hasty disappearance,

but could not avoid an instinctive conclusion that there existed

but a doubtful hope for him. As far as he could judge, his sole

chance of deliverance lay in the possibility of a rope or pole

being brought; and this possibility was remote indeed.  The soil

upon these high downs was left so untended that they were

unenclosed for miles, except by a casual bank or dry wall, and

were rarely visited but for the purpose of collecting or counting

the flock which found a scanty means of subsistence thereon.



At first, when death appeared improbable, because it had never

visited him before, Knight could think of no future, nor of

anything connected with his past.  He could only look sternly at

Nature's treacherous attempt to put an end to him, and strive to

thwart her.



From the fact that the cliff formed the inner face of the segment

of a huge cylinder, having the sky for a top and the sea for a

bottom, which enclosed the cove to the extent of more than a

semicircle, he could see the vertical face curving round on each

side of him.  He looked far down the facade, and realized more

thoroughly how it threatened him.  Grimness was in every feature,

and to its very bowels the inimical shape was desolation.



By one of those familiar conjunctions of things wherewith the

inanimate world baits the mind of man when he pauses in moments of

suspense, opposite Knight's eyes was an imbedded fossil, standing

forth in low relief from the rock.  It was a creature with eyes.

The eyes, dead and turned to stone, were even now regarding him.

It was one of the early crustaceans called Trilobites.  Separated

by millions of years in their lives, Knight and this underling

seemed to have met in their death.  It was the single instance

within reach of his vision of anything that had ever been alive

and had had a body to save, as he himself had now.



The creature represented but a low type of animal existence, for

never in their vernal years had the plains indicated by those

numberless slaty layers been traversed by an intelligence worthy

of the name.  Zoophytes, mollusca, shell-fish, were the highest

developments of those ancient dates.  The immense lapses of time

each formation represented had known nothing of the dignity of

man.  They were grand times, but they were mean times too, and

mean were their relics.  He was to be with the small in his death.



Knight was a geologist; and such is the supremacy of habit over

occasion, as a pioneer of the thoughts of men, that at this

dreadful juncture his mind found time to take in, by a momentary

sweep, the varied scenes that had had their day between this

creature's epoch and his own.  There is no place like a cleft

landscape for bringing home such imaginings as these.



Time closed up like a fan before him.  He saw himself at one

extremity of the years, face to face with the beginning and all

the intermediate centuries simultaneously.  Fierce men, clothed in

the hides of beasts, and carrying, for defence and attack, huge

clubs and pointed spears, rose from the rock, like the phantoms

before the doomed Macbeth.  They lived in hollows, woods, and mud

huts--perhaps in caves of the neighbouring rocks.  Behind them

stood an earlier band.  No man was there.  Huge elephantine forms,

the mastodon, the hippopotamus, the tapir, antelopes of monstrous

size, the megatherium, and the myledon--all, for the moment, in

juxtaposition.  Further back, and overlapped by these, were

perched huge-billed birds and swinish creatures as large as

horses.  Still more shadowy were the sinister crocodilian

outlines--alligators and other uncouth shapes, culminating in the

colossal lizard, the iguanodon.  Folded behind were dragon forms

and clouds of flying reptiles: still underneath were fishy beings

of lower development; and so on, till the lifetime scenes of the

fossil confronting him were a present and modern condition of

things.  These images passed before Knight's inner eye in less

than half a minute, and he was again considering the actual

present.  Was he to die? The mental picture of Elfride in the

world, without himself to cherish her, smote his heart like a

whip.  He had hoped for deliverance, but what could a girl do? He

dared not move an inch.  Was Death really stretching out his hand?

The previous sensation, that it was improbable he would die, was

fainter now.



However, Knight still clung to the cliff.



To those musing weather-beaten West-country folk who pass the

greater part of their days and nights out of doors, Nature seems

to have moods in other than a poetical sense: predilections for

certain deeds at certain times, without any apparent law to govern

or season to account for them.  She is read as a person with a

curious temper; as one who does not scatter kindnesses and

cruelties alternately, impartially, and in order, but heartless

severities or overwhelming generosities in lawless caprice.  Man's

case is always that of the prodigal's favourite or the miser's

pensioner.  In her unfriendly moments there seems a feline fun in

her tricks, begotten by a foretaste of her pleasure in swallowing

the victim.



Such a way of thinking had been absurd to Knight, but he began to

adopt it now.  He was first spitted on to a rock.  New tortures

followed.  The rain increased, and persecuted him with an

exceptional persistency which he was moved to believe owed its

cause to the fact that he was in such a wretched state already.

An entirely new order of things could be observed in this

introduction of rain upon the scene.  It rained upwards instead of

down.  The strong ascending air carried the rain-drops with it in

its race up the escarpment, coming to him with such velocity that

they stuck into his flesh like cold needles.  Each drop was

virtually a shaft, and it pierced him to his skin.  The water-

shafts seemed to lift him on their points: no downward rain ever

had such a torturing effect.  In a brief space he was drenched,

except in two places.  These were on the top of his shoulders and

on the crown of his hat.



The wind, though not intense in other situations was strong here.

It tugged at his coat and lifted it.  We are mostly accustomed to

look upon all opposition which is not animate, as that of the

stolid, inexorable hand of indifference, which wears out the

patience more than the strength.  Here, at any rate, hostility did

not assume that slow and sickening form.  It was a cosmic agency,

active, lashing, eager for conquest: determination; not an

insensate standing in the way.



Knight had over-estimated the strength of his hands.  They were

getting weak already.  'She will never come again; she has been

gone ten minutes,' he said to himself.



This mistake arose from the unusual compression of his experiences

just now: she had really been gone but three.



'As many more minutes will be my end,' he thought.



Next came another instance of the incapacity of the mind to make

comparisons at such times.



'This is a summer afternoon,' he said, 'and there can never have

been such a heavy and cold rain on a summer day in my life

before.'



He was again mistaken.  The rain was quite ordinary in quantity;

the air in temperature.  It was, as is usual, the menacing

attitude in which they approached him that magnified their powers.



He again looked straight downwards, the wind and the water-dashes

lifting his moustache, scudding up his cheeks, under his eyelids,

and into his eyes.  This is what he saw down there: the surface of

the sea--visually just past his toes, and under his feet; actually

one-eighth of a mile, or more than two hundred yards, below them.

We colour according to our moods the objects we survey.  The sea

would have been a deep neutral blue, had happier auspices attended

the gazer it was now no otherwise than distinctly black to his

vision.  That narrow white border was foam, he knew well; but its

boisterous tosses were so distant as to appear a pulsation only,

and its plashing was barely audible.  A white border to a black

sea--his funeral pall and its edging.



The world was to some extent turned upside down for him.  Rain

descended from below.  Beneath his feet was aerial space and the

unknown; above him was the firm, familiar ground, and upon it all

that he loved best.



Pitiless nature had then two voices, and two only.  The nearer was

the voice of the wind in his ears rising and falling as it mauled

and thrust him hard or softly.  The second and distant one was the

moan of that unplummetted ocean below and afar--rubbing its

restless flank against the Cliff without a Name.



Knight perseveringly held fast. Had he any faith in Elfride?

Perhaps.  Love is faith, and faith, like a gathered flower, will

rootlessly live on.



Nobody would have expected the sun to shine on such an evening as

this.  Yet it appeared, low down upon the sea.  Not with its

natural golden fringe, sweeping the furthest ends of the

landscape, not with the strange glare of whiteness which it

sometimes puts on as an alternative to colour, but as a splotch of

vermilion red upon a leaden ground--a red face looking on with a

drunken leer.



Most men who have brains know it, and few are so foolish as to

disguise this fact from themselves or others, even though an

ostentatious display may be called self-conceit.  Knight, without

showing it much, knew that his intellect was above the average.

And he thought--he could not help thinking--that his death would

be a deliberate loss to earth of good material; that such an

experiment in killing might have been practised upon some less

developed life.



A fancy some people hold, when in a bitter mood, is that

inexorable circumstance only tries to prevent what intelligence

attempts.  Renounce a desire for a long-contested position, and go

on another tack, and after a while the prize is thrown at you,

seemingly in disappointment that no more tantalizing is possible.



Knight gave up thoughts of life utterly and entirely, and turned

to contemplate the Dark Valley and the unknown future beyond.

Into the shadowy depths of these speculations we will not follow

him.  Let it suffice to state what ensued.



At that moment of taking no more thought for this life, something

disturbed the outline of the bank above him.  A spot appeared.  It

was the head of Elfride.



Knight immediately prepared to welcome life again.



The expression of a face consigned to utter loneliness, when a

friend first looks in upon it, is moving in the extreme.  In

rowing seaward to a light-ship or sea-girt lighthouse, where,

without any immediate terror of death, the inmates experience the

gloom of monotonous seclusion, the grateful eloquence of their

countenances at the greeting, expressive of thankfulness for the

visit, is enough to stir the emotions of the most careless

observer.



Knight's upward look at Elfride was of a nature with, but far

transcending, such an instance as this.  The lines of his face had

deepened to furrows, and every one of them thanked her visibly.

His lips moved to the word 'Elfride,' though the emotion evolved

no sound.  His eyes passed all description in their combination of

the whole diapason of eloquence, from lover's deep love to fellow-

man's gratitude for a token of remembrance from one of his kind.



Elfride had come back.  What she had come to do he did not know.

She could only look on at his death, perhaps.  Still, she had come

back, and not deserted him utterly, and it was much.



It was a novelty in the extreme to see Henry Knight, to whom

Elfride was but a child, who had swayed her as a tree sways a

bird's nest, who mastered her and made her weep most bitterly at

her own insignificance, thus thankful for a sight of her face.

She looked down upon him, her face glistening with rain and tears.

He smiled faintly.



'How calm he is!' she thought.  'How great and noble he is to be

so calm!' She would have died ten times for him then.



The gliding form of the steamboat caught her eye: she heeded it no

longer.



'How much longer can you wait?' came from her pale lips and along

the wind to his position.



'Four minutes,' said Knight in a weaker voice than her own.



'But with a good hope of being saved?'



'Seven or eight.'



He now noticed that in her arms she bore a bundle of white linen,

and that her form was singularly attenuated.  So preternaturally

thin and flexible was Elfride at this moment, that she appeared to

bend under the light blows of the rain-shafts, as they struck into

her sides and bosom, and splintered into spray on her face.  There

is nothing like a thorough drenching for reducing the

protuberances of clothes, but Elfride's seemed to cling to her

like a glove.



Without heeding the attack of the clouds further than by raising

her hand and wiping away the spirts of rain when they went more

particularly into her eyes, she sat down and hurriedly began

rending the linen into strips.  These she knotted end to end, and

afterwards twisted them like the strands of a cord.  In a short

space of time she had formed a perfect rope by this means, six or

seven yards long.



'Can you wait while I bind it?' she said, anxiously extending her

gaze down to him.



'Yes, if not very long.  Hope has given me a wonderful instalment

of strength.'



Elfride dropped her eyes again, tore the remaining material into

narrow tape-like ligaments, knotted each to each as before, but on

a smaller scale, and wound the lengthy string she had thus formed

round and round the linen rope, which, without this binding, had a

tendency to spread abroad.



'Now,' said Knight, who, watching the proceedings intently, had by

this time not only grasped her scheme, but reasoned further on, 'I

can hold three minutes longer yet.  And do you use the time in

testing the strength of the knots, one by one.'



She at once obeyed, tested each singly by putting her foot on the

rope between each knot, and pulling with her hands.  One of the

knots slipped.



'Oh, think! It would have broken but for your forethought,'

Elfride exclaimed apprehensively.



She retied the two ends.  The rope was now firm in every part.



'When you have let it down,' said Knight, already resuming his

position of ruling power, 'go back from the edge of the slope, and

over the bank as far as the rope will allow you.  Then lean down,

and hold the end with both hands.'



He had first thought of a safer plan for his own deliverance, but

it involved the disadvantage of possibly endangering her life.



'I have tied it round my waist,' she cried, 'and I will lean

directly upon the bank, holding with my hands as well.'



It was the arrangement he had thought of, but would not suggest.



'I will raise and drop it three times when I am behind the bank,'

she continued, 'to signify that I am ready.  Take care, oh, take

the greatest care, I beg you!'



She dropped the rope over him, to learn how much of its length it

would be necessary to expend on that side of the bank, went back,

and disappeared as she had done before.



The rope was trailing by Knight's shoulders.  In a few moments it

twitched three times.



He waited yet a second or two, then laid hold.



The incline of this upper portion of the precipice, to the length

only of a few feet, useless to a climber empty-handed, was

invaluable now.  Not more than half his weight depended entirely

on the linen rope.  Half a dozen extensions of the arms,

alternating with half a dozen seizures of the rope with his feet,

brought him up to the level of the soil.



He was saved, and by Elfride.



He extended his cramped limbs like an awakened sleeper, and sprang

over the bank.



At sight of him she leapt to her feet with almost a shriek of joy.

Knight's eyes met hers, and with supreme eloquence the glance of

each told a long-concealed tale of emotion in that short half-

moment.  Moved by an impulse neither could resist, they ran

together and into each other's arms.



At the moment of embracing, Elfride's eyes involuntarily flashed

towards the Puffin steamboat.  It had doubled the point, and was

no longer to be seen.



An overwhelming rush of exultation at having delivered the man she

revered from one of the most terrible forms of death, shook the

gentle girl to the centre of her soul.  It merged in a defiance of

duty to Stephen, and a total recklessness as to plighted faith.

Every nerve of her will was now in entire subjection to her

feeling--volition as a guiding power had forsaken her.  To remain

passive, as she remained now, encircled by his arms, was a

sufficiently complete result--a glorious crown to all the years of

her life.  Perhaps he was only grateful, and did not love her.  No

matter: it was infinitely more to be even the slave of the greater

than the queen of the less.  Some such sensation as this, though

it was not recognized as a finished thought, raced along the

impressionable soul of Elfride.



Regarding their attitude, it was impossible for two persons to go

nearer to a kiss than went Knight and Elfride during those minutes

of impulsive embrace in the pelting rain.  Yet they did not kiss.

Knight's peculiarity of nature was such that it would not allow

him to take advantage of the unguarded and passionate avowal she

had tacitly made.



Elfride recovered herself, and gently struggled to be free.



He reluctantly relinquished her, and then surveyed her from crown

to toe.  She seemed as small as an infant.  He perceived whence

she had obtained the rope.



'Elfride, my Elfride!' he exclaimed in gratified amazement.



'I must leave you now,' she said, her face doubling its red, with

an expression between gladness and shame 'You follow me, but at

some distance.'



'The rain and wind pierce you through; the chill will kill you.

God bless you for such devotion! Take my coat and put it on.'



'No; I shall get warm running.'



Elfride had absolutely nothing between her and the weather but her

exterior robe or 'costume.' The door had been made upon a woman's

wit, and it had found its way out.  Behind the bank, whilst Knight

reclined upon the dizzy slope waiting for death, she had taken off

her whole clothing, and replaced only her outer bodice and skirt.

Every thread of the remainder lay upon the ground in the form of a

woollen and cotton rope.



'I am used to being wet through,' she added.  'I have been

drenched on Pansy dozens of times.  Good-bye till we meet, clothed

and in our right minds, by the fireside at home!'



She then ran off from him through the pelting rain like a hare; or

more like a pheasant when, scampering away with a lowered tail, it

has a mind to fly, but does not.  Elfride was soon out of sight.



Knight felt uncomfortably wet and chilled, but glowing with

fervour nevertheless.  He fully appreciated Elfride's girlish

delicacy in refusing his escort in the meagre habiliments she

wore, yet felt that necessary abstraction of herself for a short

half-hour as a most grievous loss to him.



He gathered up her knotted and twisted plumage of linen, lace, and

embroidery work, and laid it across his arm.  He noticed on the

ground an envelope, limp and wet.  In endeavouring to restore this

to its proper shape, he loosened from the envelope a piece of

paper it had contained, which was seized by the wind in falling

from Knight's hand.  It was blown to the right, blown to the left--

it floated to the edge of the cliff and over the sea, where it

was hurled aloft.  It twirled in the air, and then flew back over

his head.



Knight followed the paper, and secured it.  Having done so, he

looked to discover if it had been worth securing.



The troublesome sheet was a banker's receipt for two hundred

pounds, placed to the credit of Miss Swancourt, which the

impractical girl had totally forgotten she carried with her.



Knight folded it as carefully as its moist condition would allow,

put it in his pocket, and followed Elfride.
