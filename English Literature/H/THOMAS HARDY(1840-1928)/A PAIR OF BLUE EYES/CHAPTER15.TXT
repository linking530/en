'A wandering voice.'





Though sheer and intelligible griefs are not charmed away by being

confided to mere acquaintances, the process is a palliative to

certain ill-humours.  Among these, perplexed vexation is one--a

species of trouble which, like a stream, gets shallower by the

simple operation of widening it in any quarter.



On the evening of the day succeeding that of the meeting in the

Park, Elfride and Mrs. Swancourt were engaged in conversation in

the dressing-room of the latter.  Such a treatment of such a case

was in course of adoption here.



Elfride had just before received an affectionate letter from

Stephen Smith in Bombay, which had been forwarded to her from

Endelstow.  But since this is not the case referred to, it is not

worth while to pry further into the contents of the letter than to

discover that, with rash though pardonable confidence in coming

times, he addressed her in high spirits as his darling future

wife. Probably there cannot be instanced a briefer and surer rule-

of-thumb test of a man's temperament--sanguine or cautious--than

this: did he or does he ante-date the word wife in corresponding

with a sweet-heart he honestly loves?



She had taken this epistle into her own room, read a little of it,

then SAVED the rest for to-morrow, not wishing to be so

extravagant as to consume the pleasure all at once.  Nevertheless,

she could not resist the wish to enjoy yet a little more, so out

came the letter again, and in spite of misgivings as to

prodigality the whole was devoured.  The letter was finally

reperused and placed in her pocket.



What was this? Also a newspaper for Elfride, which she had

overlooked in her hurry to open the letter.  It was the old number

of the PRESENT, containing the article upon her book, forwarded as

had been requested.



Elfride had hastily read it through, shrunk perceptibly smaller,

and had then gone with the paper in her hand to Mrs. Swancourt's

dressing-room, to lighten or at least modify her vexation by a

discriminating estimate from her stepmother.



She was now looking disconsolately out of the window.



'Never mind, my child,' said Mrs. Swancourt after a careful

perusal of the matter indicated.  'I don't see that the review is

such a terrible one, after all.  Besides, everybody has forgotten

about it by this time.  I'm sure the opening is good enough for

any book ever written.  Just listen--it sounds better read aloud

than when you pore over it silently: "THE COURT OF KELLYON CASTLE.

A ROMANCE OF THE MIDDLE AGES.  BY ERNEST FIELD.  In the belief

that we were for a while escaping the monotonous repetition of

wearisome details in modern social scenery, analyses of

uninteresting character, or the unnatural unfoldings of a

sensation plot, we took this volume into our hands with a feeling

of pleasure.  We were disposed to beguile ourselves with the fancy

that some new change might possibly be rung upon donjon keeps,

chain and plate armour, deeply scarred cheeks, tender maidens

disguised as pages, to which we had not listened long ago." Now,

that's a very good beginning, in my opinion, and one to be proud

of having brought out of a man who has never seen you.'



'Ah, yes,' murmured Elfride wofully.  'But, then, see further on!'



'Well the next bit is rather unkind, I must own,' said Mrs.

Swancourt, and read on.  '"Instead of this we found ourselves in

the hands of some young lady, hardly arrived at years of

discretion, to judge by the silly device it has been thought worth

while to adopt on the title-page, with the idea of disguising her

sex."'



'I am not "silly"!' said Elfride indignantly.  'He might have

called me anything but that.'



'You are not, indeed.  Well:--"Hands of a young lady...whose

chapters are simply devoted to impossible tournaments, towers, and

escapades, which read like flat copies of like scenes in the

stories of Mr. G. P. R. James, and the most unreal portions of

IVANHOE.  The bait is so palpably artificial that the most

credulous gudgeon turns away." Now, my dear, I don't see overmuch

to complain of in that.  It proves that you were clever enough to

make him think of Sir Walter Scott, which is a great deal.'



'Oh yes; though I cannot romance myself, I am able to remind him

of those who can!' Elfride intended to hurl these words

sarcastically at her invisible enemy, but as she had no more

satirical power than a wood-pigeon, they merely fell in a pretty

murmur from lips shaped to a pout.



'Certainly: and that's something.  Your book is good enough to be

bad in an ordinary literary manner, and doesn't stand by itself in

a melancholy position altogether worse than assailable.--"That

interest in an historical romance may nowadays have any chance of

being sustained, it is indispensable that the reader find himself

under the guidance of some nearly extinct species of legendary,

who, in addition to an impulse towards antiquarian research and an

unweakened faith in the mediaeval halo, shall possess an inventive

faculty in which delicacy of sentiment is far overtopped by a

power of welding to stirring incident a spirited variety of the

elementary human passions." Well, that long-winded effusion

doesn't refer to you at all, Elfride, merely something put in to

fill up.  Let me see, when does he come to you again;...not till

the very end, actually.  Here you are finally polished off:



'"But to return to the little work we have used as the text of

this article.  We are far from altogether disparaging the author's

powers.  She has a certain versatility that enables her to use

with effect a style of narration peculiar to herself, which may be

called a murmuring of delicate emotional trifles, the particular

gift of those to whom the social sympathies of a peaceful time are

as daily food.  Hence, where matters of domestic experience, and

the natural touches which make people real, can be introduced

without anachronisms too striking, she is occasionally felicitous;

and upon the whole we feel justified in saying that the book will

bear looking into for the sake of those portions which have

nothing whatever to do with the story."



'Well, I suppose it is intended for satire; but don't think

anything more of it now, my dear.  It is seven o'clock.' And Mrs.

Swancourt rang for her maid.



Attack is more piquant than concord.  Stephen's letter was

concerning nothing but oneness with her: the review was the very

reverse.  And a stranger with neither name nor shape, age nor

appearance, but a mighty voice, is naturally rather an interesting

novelty to a lady he chooses to address.  When Elfride fell asleep

that night she was loving the writer of the letter, but thinking

of the writer of that article.
