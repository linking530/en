'How should I greet thee?'





Love frequently dies of time alone--much more frequently of

displacement.  With Elfride Swancourt, a powerful reason why the

displacement should be successful was that the new-comer was a

greater man than the first. By the side of the instructive and

piquant snubbings she received from Knight, Stephen's general

agreeableness seemed watery; by the side of Knight's spare love-

making, Stephen's continual outflow seemed lackadaisical.  She had

begun to sigh for somebody further on in manhood.  Stephen was

hardly enough of a man.



Perhaps there was a proneness to inconstancy in her nature--a

nature, to those who contemplate it from a standpoint beyond the

influence of that inconstancy, the most exquisite of all in its

plasticity and ready sympathies.  Partly, too, Stephen's failure

to make his hold on her heart a permanent one was his too timid

habit of dispraising himself beside her--a peculiarity which,

exercised towards sensible men, stirs a kindly chord of attachment

that a marked assertiveness would leave untouched, but inevitably

leads the most sensible woman in the world to undervalue him who

practises it.  Directly domineering ceases in the man, snubbing

begins in the woman; the trite but no less unfortunate fact being

that the gentler creature rarely has the capacity to appreciate

fair treatment from her natural complement.  The abiding

perception of the position of Stephen's parents had, of course, a

little to do with Elfride's renunciation.  To such girls poverty

may not be, as to the more worldly masses of humanity, a sin in

itself; but it is a sin, because graceful and dainty manners

seldom exist in such an atmosphere.  Few women of old family can

be thoroughly taught that a fine soul may wear a smock-frock, and

an admittedly common man in one is but a worm in their eyes.  John

Smith's rough hands and clothes, his wife's dialect, the necessary

narrowness of their ways, being constantly under Elfride's notice,

were not without their deflecting influence.



On reaching home after the perilous adventure by the sea-shore,

Knight had felt unwell, and retired almost immediately.  The young

lady who had so materially assisted him had done the same, but she

reappeared, properly clothed, about five o'clock.  She wandered

restlessly about the house, but not on account of their joint

narrow escape from death.  The storm which had torn the tree had

merely bowed the reed, and with the deliverance of Knight all deep

thought of the accident had left her.  The mutual avowal which it

had been the means of precipitating occupied a far longer length

of her meditations.



Elfride's disquiet now was on account of that miserable promise to

meet Stephen, which returned like a spectre again and again.  The

perception of his littleness beside Knight grew upon her

alarmingly.  She now thought how sound had been her father's

advice to her to give him up, and was as passionately desirous of

following it as she had hitherto been averse.  Perhaps there is

nothing more hardening to the tone of young minds than thus to

discover how their dearest and strongest wishes become gradually

attuned by Time the Cynic to the very note of some selfish policy

which in earlier days they despised.



The hour of appointment came, and with it a crisis; and with the

crisis a collapse.



'God forgive me--I can't meet Stephen!' she exclaimed to herself.

'I don't love him less, but I love Mr. Knight more!'



Yes: she would save herself from a man not fit for her--in spite

of vows.  She would obey her father, and have no more to do with

Stephen Smith.  Thus the fickle resolve showed signs of assuming

the complexion of a virtue.



The following days were passed without any definite avowal from

Knight's lips.  Such solitary walks and scenes as that witnessed

by Smith in the summer-house were frequent, but he courted her so

intangibly that to any but such a delicate perception as Elfride's

it would have appeared no courtship at all.  The time now really

began to be sweet with her.  She dismissed the sense of sin in her

past actions, and was automatic in the intoxication of the moment.

The fact that Knight made no actual declaration was no drawback.

Knowing since the betrayal of his sentiments that love for her

really existed, she preferred it for the present in its form of

essence, and was willing to avoid for awhile the grosser medium of

words.  Their feelings having been forced to a rather premature

demonstration, a reaction was indulged in by both.



But no sooner had she got rid of her troubled conscience on the

matter of faithlessness than a new anxiety confronted her.  It was

lest Knight should accidentally meet Stephen in the parish, and

that herself should be the subject of discourse.



Elfride, learning Knight more thoroughly, perceived that, far

from having a notion of Stephen's precedence, he had no idea that

she had ever been wooed before by anybody.  On ordinary occasions

she had a tongue so frank as to show her whole mind, and a mind so

straightforward as to reveal her heart to its innermost shrine.

But the time for a change had come.  She never alluded to even a

knowledge of Knight's friend.  When women are secret they are

secret indeed; and more often than not they only begin to be

secret with the advent of a second lover.



The elopement was now a spectre worse than the first, and, like

the Spirit in Glenfinlas, it waxed taller with every attempt to

lay it.  Her natural honesty invited her to confide in Knight, and

trust to his generosity for forgiveness: she knew also that as

mere policy it would be better to tell him early if he was to be

told at all.  The longer her concealment the more difficult would

be the revelation.  But she put it off.  The intense fear which

accompanies intense love in young women was too strong to allow

the exercise of a moral quality antagonistic to itself:





   'Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;

    Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.'





The match was looked upon as made by her father and mother.  The

vicar remembered her promise to reveal the meaning of the telegram

she had received, and two days after the scene in the summer-

house, asked her pointedly.  She was frank with him now.



'I had been corresponding with Stephen Smith ever since he left

England, till lately,' she calmly said.



'What!' cried the vicar aghast; 'under the eyes of Mr. Knight,

too?'



'No; when I found I cared most for Mr. Knight, I obeyed you.'



'You were very kind, I'm sure.  When did you begin to like Mr.

Knight?'



'I don't see that that is a pertinent question, papa; the telegram

was from the shipping agent, and was not sent at my request. It

announced the arrival of the vessel bringing him home.'



'Home! What, is he here?'



'Yes; in the village, I believe.'



'Has he tried to see you?'



'Only by fair means.  But don't, papa, question me so! It is

torture.'



'I will only say one word more,' he replied.  'Have you met him?'



'I have not.  I can assure you that at the present moment there is

no more of an understanding between me and the young man you so

much disliked than between him and you.  You told me to forget

him; and I have forgotten him.'



'Oh, well; though you did not obey me in the beginning, you are a

good girl, Elfride, in obeying me at last.'



'Don't call me "good," papa,' she said bitterly; 'you don't know--

and the less said about some things the better.  Remember, Mr.

Knight knows nothing about the other.  Oh, how wrong it all is! I

don't know what I am coming to.'



'As matters stand, I should be inclined to tell him; or, at any

rate, I should not alarm myself about his knowing.  He found out

the other day that this was the parish young Smith's father lives

in--what puts you in such a flurry?'



'I can't say; but promise--pray don't let him know! It would be my

ruin!'



'Pooh, child.  Knight is a good fellow and a clever man; but at

the same time it does not escape my perceptions that he is no

great catch for you.  Men of his turn of mind are nothing so

wonderful in the way of husbands.  If you had chosen to wait, you

might have mated with a much wealthier man.  But remember, I have

not a word to say against your having him, if you like him.

Charlotte is delighted, as you know.'



'Well, papa,' she said, smiling hopefully through a sigh, 'it is

nice to feel that in giving way to--to caring for him, I have

pleased my family.  But I am not good; oh no, I am very far from

that!'



'None of us are good, I am sorry to say,' said her father blandly;

'but girls have a chartered right to change their minds, you know.

It has been recognized by poets from time immemorial.  Catullus

says, "Mulier cupido quod dicit amanti, in vento--' What a memory

mine is! However, the passage is, that a woman's words to a lover

are as a matter of course written only on wind and water.  Now

don't be troubled about that, Elfride.'



'Ah, you don't know!'



They had been standing on the lawn, and Knight was now seen

lingering some way down a winding walk.  When Elfride met him, it

was with a much greater lightness of heart; things were more

straightforward now.  The responsibility of her fickleness seemed

partly shifted from her own shoulders to her father's.  Still,

there were shadows.



'Ah, could he have known how far I went with Stephen, and yet have

said the same, how much happier I should be!' That was her

prevailing thought.



In the afternoon the lovers went out together on horseback for an

hour or two; and though not wishing to be observed, by reason of

the late death of Lady Luxellian, whose funeral had taken place

very privately on the previous day, they yet found it necessary to

pass East Endelstow Church.



The steps to the vault, as has been stated, were on the outside of

the building, immediately under the aisle wall.  Being on

horseback, both Knight and Elfride could overlook the shrubs which

screened the church-yard.



'Look, the vault seems still to be open,' said Knight.



'Yes, it is open,' she answered



'Who is that man close by it?  The mason, I suppose?'



'Yes.'



'I wonder if it is John Smith, Stephen's father?'



'I believe it is,' said Elfride, with apprehension.



'Ah, and can it be? I should like to inquire how his son, my

truant protege', is going on.  And from your father's description

of the vault, the interior must be interesting.  Suppose we go

in.'



'Had we better, do you think? May not Lord Luxellian be there?'



'It is not at all likely.'



Elfride then assented, since she could do nothing else.  Her

heart, which at first had quailed in consternation, recovered

itself when she considered the character of John Smith.  A quiet

unassuming man, he would be sure to act towards her as before

those love passages with his son, which might have given a more

pretentious mechanic airs.  So without much alarm she took

Knight's arm after dismounting, and went with him between and over

the graves.  The master-mason recognized her as she approached,

and, as usual, lifted his hat respectfully.



'I know you to be Mr. Smith, my former friend Stephen's father,'

said Knight, directly he had scanned the embrowned and ruddy

features of John.



'Yes, sir, I b'lieve I be.'



'How is your son now? I have only once heard from him since he

went to India.  I daresay you have heard him speak of me--Mr.

Knight, who became acquainted with him some years ago in

Exonbury.'



'Ay, that I have.  Stephen is very well, thank you, sir, and he's

in England; in fact, he's at home.  In short, sir, he's down in

the vault there, a-looking at the departed coffins.'



Elfride's heart fluttered like a butterfly.



Knight looked amazed.  'Well, that is extraordinary.' he murmured.

'Did he know I was in the parish?'



'I really can't say, sir,' said John, wishing himself out of the

entanglement he rather suspected than thoroughly understood.



'Would it be considered an intrusion by the family if we went into

the vault?'



'Oh, bless ye, no, sir; scores of folk have been stepping down.

'Tis left open a-purpose.'



'We will go down, Elfride.'



'I am afraid the air is close,' she said appealingly.



'Oh no, ma'am,' said John.  'We white-limed the walls and arches

the day 'twas opened, as we always do, and again on the morning of

the funeral; the place is as sweet as a granary.



'Then I should like you to accompany me, Elfie; having originally

sprung from the family too.'



'I don't like going where death is so emphatically present.  I'll

stay by the horses whilst you go in; they may get loose.'



'What nonsense! I had no idea your sentiments were so flimsily

formed as to be perturbed by a few remnants of mortality; but stay

out, if you are so afraid, by all means.'



'Oh no, I am not afraid; don't say that.'



She held miserably to his arm, thinking that, perhaps, the

revelation might as well come at once as ten minutes later, for

Stephen would be sure to accompany his friend to his horse.



At first, the gloom of the vault, which was lighted only by a

couple of candles, was too great to admit of their seeing anything

distinctly; but with a further advance Knight discerned, in front

of the black masses lining the walls, a young man standing, and

writing in a pocket-book.



Knight said one word: 'Stephen!'



Stephen Smith, not being in such absolute ignorance of Knight's

whereabouts as Knight had been of Smith's instantly recognized his

friend, and knew by rote the outlines of the fair woman standing

behind him.



Stephen came forward and shook him by the hand, without speaking.



'Why have you not written, my boy?' said Knight, without in any

way signifying Elfride's presence to Stephen.  To the essayist,

Smith was still the country lad whom he had patronized and tended;

one to whom the formal presentation of a lady betrothed to himself

would have seemed incongruous and absurd.



'Why haven't you written to me?' said Stephen.



'Ah, yes.  Why haven't I? why haven't we? That's always the query

which we cannot clearly answer without an unsatisfactory sense of

our inadequacies.  However, I have not forgotten you, Smith.  And

now we have met; and we must meet again, and have a longer chat

than this can conveniently be.  I must know all you have been

doing.  That yon have thriven, I know, and you must teach me the

way.'



Elfride stood in the background.  Stephen had read the position at

a glance, and immediately guessed that she had never mentioned his

name to Knight.  His tact in avoiding catastrophes was the chief

quality which made him intellectually respectable, in which

quality he far transcended Knight; and he decided that a tranquil

issue out of the encounter, without any harrowing of the feelings

of either Knight or Elfride, was to be attempted if possible.  His

old sense of indebtedness to Knight had never wholly forsaken him;

his love for Elfride was generous now.



As far as he dared look at her movements he saw that her bearing

towards him would be dictated by his own towards her; and if he

acted as a stranger she would do likewise as a means of

deliverance.  Circumstances favouring this course, it was

desirable also to be rather reserved towards Knight, to shorten

the meeting as much as possible.



'I am afraid that my time is almost too short to allow even of

such a pleasure,' he said.  'I leave here to-morrow.  And until I

start for the Continent and India, which will be in a fortnight, I

shall have hardly a moment to spare.'



Knight's disappointment and dissatisfied looks at this reply sent

a pang through Stephen as great as any he had felt at the sight of

Elfride.  The words about shortness of time were literally true,

but their tone was far from being so.  He would have been

gratified to talk with Knight as in past times, and saw as a dead

loss to himself that, to save the woman who cared nothing for him,

he was deliberately throwing away his friend.



'Oh, I am sorry to hear that,' said Knight, in a changed tone.

'But of course, if you have weighty concerns to attend to, they

must not be neglected.  And if this is to be our first and last

meeting, let me say that I wish you success with all my heart!'

Knight's warmth revived towards the end; the solemn impressions he

was beginning to receive from the scene around them abstracting

from his heart as a puerility any momentary vexation at words.

'It is a strange place for us to meet in,' he continued, looking

round the vault.



Stephen briefly assented, and there was a silence.  The blackened

coffins were now revealed more clearly than at first, the whitened

walls and arches throwing them forward in strong relief.  It was a

scene which was remembered by all three as an indelible mark in

their history.  Knight, with an abstracted face, was standing

between his companions, though a little in advance of them,

Elfride being on his right hand, and Stephen Smith on his left.

The white daylight on his right side gleamed faintly in, and was

toned to a blueness by contrast with the yellow rays from the

candle against the wall.  Elfride, timidly shrinking back, and

nearest the entrance, received most of the light therefrom, whilst

Stephen was entirely in candlelight, and to him the spot of outer

sky visible above the steps was as a steely blue patch, and

nothing more.



'I have been here two or three times since it was opened,' said

Stephen.  'My father was engaged in the work, you know.'



'Yes.  What are you doing?' Knight inquired, looking at the note-

book and pencil Stephen held in his hand.



'I have been sketching a few details in the church, and since then

I have been copying the names from some of the coffins here.

Before I left England I used to do a good deal of this sort of

thing.'



'Yes; of course.  Ah, that's poor Lady Luxellian, I suppose.'

Knight pointed to a coffin of light satin-wood, which stood on the

stone sleepers in the new niche.  'And the remainder of the family

are on this side.  Who are those two, so snug and close together?'



Stephen's voice altered slightly as he replied  'That's Lady

Elfride Kingsmore--born Luxellian, and that is Arthur, her

husband.  I have heard my father say that they--he--ran away with

her, and married her against the wish of her parents.'



'Then I imagine this to be where you got your Christian name, Miss

Swancourt?' said Knight, turning to her.  'I think you told me it

was three or four generations ago that your family branched off

from the Luxellians?'



'She was my grandmother,' said Elfride, vainly endeavouring to

moisten her dry lips before she spoke.  Elfride had then the

conscience-stricken look of Guido's Magdalen, rendered upon a more

childlike form.  She kept her face partially away from Knight and

Stephen, and set her eyes upon the sky visible outside, as if her

salvation depended upon quickly reaching it.  Her left hand rested

lightly within Knight's arm, half withdrawn, from a sense of shame

at claiming him before her old lover, yet unwilling to renounce

him; so that her glove merely touched his sleeve.  '"Can one be

pardoned, and retain the offence?"' quoted Elfride's heart then.



Conversation seemed to have no self-sustaining power, and went on

in the shape of disjointed remarks.  'One's mind gets thronged

with thoughts while standing so solemnly here,' Knight said, in a

measured quiet voice.  'How much has been said on death from time

to time! how much we ourselves can think upon it! We may fancy

each of these who lie here saying:





    'For Thou, to make my fall more great,

        Didst lift me up on high.'





What comes next, Elfride? It is the Hundred-and-second Psalm I am

thinking of.'



'Yes, I know it,' she murmured, and went on in a still lower

voice, seemingly afraid for any words from the emotional side of

her nature to reach Stephen:





   '"My days, just hastening to their end,

        Are like an evening shade;

     My beauty doth, like wither'd grass,

        With waning lustre fade."'





'Well,' said Knight musingly, 'let us leave them.  Such occasions

as these seem to compel us to roam outside ourselves, far away

from the fragile frame we live in, and to expand till our

perception grows so vast that our physical reality bears no sort

of proportion to it.  We look back upon the weak and minute stem

on which this luxuriant growth depends, and ask, Can it be

possible that such a capacity has a foundation so small? Must I

again return to my daily walk in that narrow cell, a human body,

where worldly thoughts can torture me? Do we not?'



'Yes,' said Stephen and Elfride.



'One has a sense of wrong, too, that such an appreciative breadth

as a sentient being possesses should be committed to the frail

casket of a body.  What weakens one's intentions regarding the

future like the thought of this?...However, let us tune ourselves

to a more cheerful chord, for there's a great deal to be done yet

by us all.'



As Knight meditatively addressed his juniors thus, unconscious of

the deception practised, for different reasons, by the severed

hearts at his side, and of the scenes that had in earlier days

united them, each one felt that he and she did not gain by

contrast with their musing mentor.  Physically not so handsome as

either the youthful architect or the vicar's daughter, the

thoroughness and integrity of Knight illuminated his features with

a dignity not even incipient in the other two.  It is difficult to

frame rules which shall apply to both sexes, and Elfride, an

undeveloped girl, must, perhaps, hardly be laden with the moral

responsibilities which attach to a man in like circumstances.  The

charm of woman, too, lies partly in her subtleness in matters of

love.  But if honesty is a virtue in itself, Elfride, having none

of it now, seemed, being for being, scarcely good enough for

Knight.  Stephen, though deceptive for no unworthy purpose, was

deceptive after all; and whatever good results grace such strategy

if it succeed, it seldom draws admiration, especially when it

fails.



On an ordinary occasion, had Knight been even quite alone with

Stephen, he would hardly have alluded to his possible relationship

to Elfride.  But moved by attendant circumstances Knight was

impelled to be confiding.



'Stephen,' he said, 'this lady is Miss Swancourt.  I am staying at

her father's house, as you probably know.' He stepped a few paces

nearer to Smith, and said in a lower tone: 'I may as well tell you

that we are engaged to be married.'



Low as the words had been spoken, Elfride had heard them, and

awaited Stephen's reply in breathless silence, if that could be

called silence where Elfride's dress, at each throb of her heart,

shook and indicated it like a pulse-glass, rustling also against

the wall in reply to the same throbbing.  The ray of daylight

which reached her face lent it a blue pallor in comparison with

those of the other two.



'I congratulate you,' Stephen whispered; and said aloud, 'I know

Miss Swancourt--a little.  You must remember that my father is a

parishioner of Mr. Swancourt's.'



'I thought you might possibly not have lived at home since they

have been here.'



'I have never lived at home, certainly, since that time.'



'I have seen Mr. Smith,' faltered Elfride.



'Well, there is no excuse for me.  As strangers to each other I

ought, I suppose, to have introduced you: as acquaintances, I

should not have stood so persistently between you.  But the fact

is, Smith, you seem a boy to me, even now.'



Stephen appeared to have a more than previous consciousness of the

intense cruelty of his fate at the present moment.  He could not

repress the words, uttered with a dim bitterness:



'You should have said that I seemed still the rural mechanic's son

I am, and hence an unfit subject for the ceremony of

introductions.'



'Oh, no, no! I won't have that.' Knight endeavoured to give his

reply a laughing tone in Elfride's ears, and an earnestness in

Stephen's: in both which efforts he signally failed, and produced

a forced speech pleasant to neither.  'Well, let us go into the

open air again; Miss Swancourt, you are particularly silent.  You

mustn't mind Smith.  I have known him for years, as I have told

you.'



'Yes, you have,' she said.



'To think she has never mentioned her knowledge of me!' Smith

murmured, and thought with some remorse how much her conduct

resembled his own on his first arrival at her house as a stranger

to the place.



They ascended to the daylight, Knight taking no further notice of

Elfride's manner, which, as usual, he attributed to the natural

shyness of a young woman at being discovered walking with him on

terms which left not much doubt of their meaning.  Elfride stepped

a little in advance, and passed through the churchyard.



'You are changed very considerably, Smith,' said Knight, 'and I

suppose it is no more than was to be expected.  However, don't

imagine that I shall feel any the less interest in you and your

fortunes whenever you care to confide them to me.  I have not

forgotten the attachment you spoke of as your reason for going

away to India.  A London young lady, was it not? I hope all is

prosperous?'



'No: the match is broken off.'



It being always difficult to know whether to express sorrow or

gladness under such circumstances--all depending upon the

character of the match--Knight took shelter in the safe words: 'I

trust it was for the best.'



'I hope it was.  But I beg that you will not press me further: no,

you have not pressed me--I don't mean that--but I would rather not

speak upon the subject.'



Stephen's words were hurried.



Knight said no more, and they followed in the footsteps of

Elfride, who still kept some paces in advance, and had not heard

Knight's unconscious allusion to her.  Stephen bade him adieu at

the churchyard-gate without going outside, and watched whilst he

and his sweetheart mounted their horses.



'Good heavens, Elfride,' Knight exclaimed, 'how pale you are! I

suppose I ought not to have taken you into that vault.  What is

the matter?'



'Nothing,' said Elfride faintly.  'I shall be myself in a moment.

All was so strange and unexpected down there, that it made me

unwell.'



'I thought you said very little.  Shall I get some water?'



'No, no.'



'Do you think it is safe for you to mount?'



'Quite--indeed it is,' she said, with a look of appeal.



'Now then--up she goes!' whispered Knight, and lifted her tenderly

into the saddle.



Her old lover still looked on at the performance as he leant over

the gate a dozen yards off.  Once in the saddle, and having a firm

grip of the reins, she turned her head as if by a resistless

fascination, and for the first time since that memorable parting

on the moor outside St. Launce's after the passionate attempt at

marriage with him, Elfride looked in the face of the young man she

first had loved.  He was the youth who had called her his

inseparable wife many a time, and whom she had even addressed as

her husband.  Their eyes met.  Measurement of life should be

proportioned rather to the intensity of the experience than to its

actual length.  Their glance, but a moment chronologically, was a

season in their history.  To Elfride the intense agony of reproach

in Stephen's eye was a nail piercing her heart with a deadliness

no words can describe.  With a spasmodic effort she withdrew her

eyes, urged on the horse, and in the chaos of perturbed memories

was oblivious of any presence beside her.  The deed of deception

was complete.



Gaining a knoll on which the park transformed itself into wood and

copse, Knight came still closer to her side, and said, 'Are you

better now, dearest?'



'Oh yes.' She pressed a hand to her eyes, as if to blot out the

image of Stephen.  A vivid scarlet spot now shone with

preternatural brightness in the centre of each cheek, leaving the

remainder of her face lily-white as before.



'Elfride,' said Knight, rather in his old tone of mentor, 'you

know I don't for a moment chide you, but is there not a great deal

of unwomanly weakness in your allowing yourself to be so

overwhelmed by the sight of what, after all, is no novelty? Every

woman worthy of the name should, I think, be able to look upon

death with something like composure.  Surely you think so too?'



'Yes; I own it.'



His obtuseness to the cause of her indisposition, by evidencing

his entire freedom from the suspicion of anything behind the

scenes, showed how incapable Knight was of deception himself,

rather than any inherent dulness in him regarding human nature.

This, clearly perceived by Elfride, added poignancy to her self-

reproach, and she idolized him the more because of their

difference.  Even the recent sight of Stephen's face and the sound

of his voice, which for a moment had stirred a chord or two of

ancient kindness, were unable to keep down the adoration re-

existent now that he was again out of view.



She had replied to Knight's question hastily, and immediately went

on to speak of indifferent subjects.  After they had reached home

she was apart from him till dinner-time.  When dinner was over,

and they were watching the dusk in the drawing-room, Knight

stepped out upon the terrace.  Elfride went after him very

decisively, on the spur of a virtuous intention.



'Mr. Knight, I want to tell you something,' she said, with quiet

firmness.



'And what is it about?' gaily returned her lover.  'Happiness, I

hope.  Do not let anything keep you so sad as you seem to have

been to-day.'



'I cannot mention the matter until I tell you the whole substance

of it,' she said.  'And that I will do to-morrow.  I have been

reminded of it to-day.  It is about something I once did, and

don't think I ought to have done.'



This, it must be said, was rather a mild way of referring to a

frantic passion and flight, which, much or little in itself, only

accident had saved from being a scandal in the public eye.



Knight thought the matter some trifle, and said pleasantly:



'Then I am not to hear the dreadful confession now?'



'No, not now.  I did not mean to-night,' Elfride responded, with a

slight decline in the firmness of her voice.  'It is not light as

you think it--it troubles me a great deal.'  Fearing now the

effect of her own earnestness, she added forcedly, 'Though,

perhaps, you may think it light after all.'



'But you have not said when it is to be?'



'To-morrow morning.  Name a time, will you, and bind me to it? I

want you to fix an hour, because I am weak, and may otherwise try

to get out of it.' She added a little artificial laugh, which

showed how timorous her resolution was still.



'Well, say after breakfast--at eleven o'clock.'



'Yes, eleven o'clock.  I promise you.  Bind me strictly to my

word.'
