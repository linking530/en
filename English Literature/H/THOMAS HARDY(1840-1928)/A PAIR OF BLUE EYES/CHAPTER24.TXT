'Breeze, bird, and flower confess the hour.'





The rain had ceased since the sunset, but it was a cloudy night;

and the light of the moon, softened and dispersed by its misty

veil, was distributed over the land in pale gray.



A dark figure stepped from the doorway of John Smith's river-side

cottage, and strode rapidly towards West Endelstow with a light

footstep.  Soon ascending from the lower levels he turned a

corner, followed a cart-track, and saw the tower of the church he

was in quest of distinctly shaped forth against the sky.  In less

than half an hour from the time of starting he swung himself over

the churchyard stile.



The wild irregular enclosure was as much as ever an integral part

of the old hill.  The grass was still long, the graves were shaped

precisely as passing years chose to alter them from their orthodox

form as laid down by Martin Cannister, and by Stephen's own

grandfather before him.



A sound sped into the air from the direction in which Castle

Boterel lay.  It was the striking of the church clock, distinct in

the still atmosphere as if it had come from the tower hard by,

which, wrapt in its solitary silentness, gave out no such sounds

of life.



'One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.' Stephen

carefully counted the strokes, though he well knew their number

beforehand.  Nine o'clock.  It was the hour Elfride had herself

named as the most convenient for meeting him.



Stephen stood at the door of the porch and listened.  He could

have heard the softest breathing of any person within the porch;

nobody was there.  He went inside the doorway, sat down upon the

stone bench, and waited with a beating heart.



The faint sounds heard only accentuated the silence.  The rising

and falling of the sea, far away along the coast, was the most

important.  A minor sound was the scurr of a distant night-hawk.

Among the minutest where all were minute were the light settlement

of gossamer fragments floating in the air, a toad humbly labouring

along through the grass near the entrance, the crackle of a dead

leaf which a worm was endeavouring to pull into the earth, a waft

of air, getting nearer and nearer, and expiring at his feet under

the burden of a winged seed.



Among all these soft sounds came not the only soft sound he cared

to hear--the footfall of Elfride.



For a whole quarter of an hour Stephen sat thus intent, without

moving a muscle.  At the end of that time he walked to the west

front of the church.  Turning the corner of the tower, a white

form stared him in the face.  He started back, and recovered

himself.  It was the tomb of young farmer Jethway, looking still

as fresh and as new as when it was first erected, the white stone

in which it was hewn having a singular weirdness amid the dark

blue slabs from local quarries, of which the whole remaining

gravestones were formed.



He thought of the night when he had sat thereon with Elfride as

his companion, and well remembered his regret that she had

received, even unwillingly, earlier homage than his own.  But his

present tangible anxiety reduced such a feeling to sentimental

nonsense in comparison; and he strolled on over the graves to the

border of the churchyard, whence in the daytime could be clearly

seen the vicarage and the present residence of the Swancourts.  No

footstep was discernible upon the path up the hill, but a light

was shining from a window in the last-named house.



Stephen knew there could be no mistake about the time or place,

and no difficulty about keeping the engagement.  He waited yet

longer, passing from impatience into a mood which failed to take

any account of the lapse of time.  He was awakened from his

reverie by Castle Boterel clock.



One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, TEN .



One little fall of the hammer in addition to the number it had

been sharp pleasure to hear, and what a difference to him!



He left the churchyard on the side opposite to his point of

entrance, and went down the hill.  Slowly he drew near the gate of

her house.  This he softly opened, and walked up the gravel drive

to the door.  Here he paused for several minutes.



At the expiration of that time the murmured speech of a manly

voice came out to his ears through an open window behind the

corner of the house.  This was responded to by a clear soft laugh.

It was the laugh of Elfride.



Stephen was conscious of a gnawing pain at his heart.  He

retreated as he had come.  There are disappointments which wring

us, and there are those which inflict a wound whose mark we bear

to our graves.  Such are so keen that no future gratification of

the same desire can ever obliterate them: they become registered

as a permanent loss of happiness.  Such a one was Stephen's now:

the crowning aureola of the dream had been the meeting here by

stealth; and if Elfride had come to him only ten minutes after he

had turned away, the disappointment would have been recognizable

still.



When the young man reached home he found there a letter which had

arrived in his absence.  Believing it to contain some reason for

her non-appearance, yet unable to imagine one that could justify

her, he hastily tore open the envelope.



The paper contained not a word from Elfride.  It was the deposit-

note for his two hundred pounds.  On the back was the form of a

cheque, and this she had filled up with the same sum, payable to

the bearer.



Stephen was confounded.  He attempted to divine her motive.

Considering how limited was his knowledge of her later actions, he

guessed rather shrewdly that, between the time of her sending the

note in the morning and the evening's silent refusal of his gift,

something had occurred which had caused a total change in her

attitude towards him.



He knew not what to do.  It seemed absurd now to go to her father

next morning, as he had purposed, and ask for an engagement with

her, a possibility impending all the while that Elfride herself

would not be on his side.  Only one course recommended itself as

wise.  To wait and see what the days would bring forth; to go and

execute his commissions in Birmingham; then to return, learn if

anything had happened, and try what a meeting might do; perhaps

her surprise at his backwardness would bring her forward to show

latent warmth as decidedly as in old times.



This act of patience was in keeping only with the nature of a man

precisely of Stephen's constitution.  Nine men out of ten would

perhaps have rushed off, got into her presence, by fair means or

foul, and provoked a catastrophe of some sort.  Possibly for the

better, probably for the worse.



He started for Birmingham the next morning.  A day's delay would

have made no difference; but he could not rest until he had begun

and ended the programme proposed to himself.  Bodily activity will

sometimes take the sting out of anxiety as completely as assurance

itself.
