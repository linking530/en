'Journeys end in lovers meeting.'





Stephen lay watching the Great Bear; Elfride was regarding a

monotonous parallelogram of window blind.  Neither slept that

night.



Early the next morning--that is to say, four hours after their

stolen interview, and just as the earliest servant was heard

moving about--Stephen Smith went downstairs, portmanteau in hand.

Throughout the night he had intended to see Mr. Swancourt again,

but the sharp rebuff of the  previous evening rendered such an

interview particularly distasteful.  Perhaps there was another and

less honest reason.  He decided to put it off.  Whatever of moral

timidity or obliquity may have lain in such a decision, no

perception of it was strong enough to detain him.  He wrote a note

in his room, which stated simply that he did not feel happy in the

house after Mr. Swancourt's sudden veto on what he had favoured a

few hours before; but that he hoped a time would come, and that

soon, when his original feelings of pleasure as Mr. Swancourt's

guest might be recovered.



He expected to find the downstairs rooms wearing the gray and

cheerless aspect that early morning gives to everything out of the

sun.  He found in the dining room a breakfast laid, of which

somebody had just partaken.



Stephen gave the maid-servant his note of adieu.  She stated that

Mr. Swancourt had risen early that morning, and made an early

breakfast. He was not going away that she knew of.



Stephen took a cup of coffee, left the house of his love, and

turned into the lane.  It was so early that the shaded places

still smelt like night time, and the sunny spots had hardly felt

the sun.  The horizontal rays made every shallow dip in the ground

to show as a well-marked hollow.  Even the channel of the path was

enough to throw shade, and the very stones of the road cast

tapering dashes of darkness westward, as long as Jael's tent-nail.



At a spot not more than a hundred yards from the vicar's residence

the lane leading thence crossed the high road.  Stephen reached

the point of intersection, stood still and listened.  Nothing

could be heard save the lengthy, murmuring line of the sea upon

the adjacent shore.  He looked at his watch, and then mounted a

gate upon which he seated himself, to await the arrival of the

carrier.  Whilst he sat he heard wheels coming in two directions.



The vehicle approaching on his right he soon recognized as the

carrier's.  There were the accompanying sounds of the owner's

voice and the smack of his whip, distinct in the still morning

air, by which he encouraged his horses up the hill.



The other set of wheels sounded from the lane Stephen had just

traversed.  On closer observation, he perceived that they were

moving from the precincts of the ancient manor-house adjoining the

vicarage grounds.  A carriage then left the entrance gates of the

house, and wheeling round came fully in sight.  It was a plain

travelling carriage, with a small quantity of luggage, apparently

a lady's.  The vehicle came to the junction of the four ways half-

a-minute before the carrier reached the same spot, and crossed

directly in his front, proceeding by the lane on the other side.



Inside the carriage Stephen could just discern an elderly lady

with a younger woman, who seemed to be her maid.  The road they

had taken led to Stratleigh, a small watering-place sixteen miles

north.



He heard the manor-house gates swing again, and looking up saw

another person leaving them, and walking off in the direction of

the parsonage.  'Ah, how much I wish I were moving that way!' felt

he parenthetically.  The gentleman was tall, and resembled Mr.

Swancourt in outline and attire.  He opened the vicarage gate and

went in.  Mr. Swancourt, then, it certainly was.  Instead of

remaining in bed that morning Mr. Swancourt must have taken it

into his head to see his new neighbour off on a journey.  He must

have been greatly interested in that neighbour to do such an

unusual thing.



The carrier's conveyance had pulled up, and Stephen now handed in

his portmanteau and mounted the shafts. 'Who is that lady in the

carriage?' he inquired indifferently of Lickpan the carrier.



'That, sir, is Mrs. Troyton, a widder wi' a mint o' money.  She's

the owner of all that part of Endelstow that is not Lord

Luxellian's.  Only been here a short time; she came into it by

law.  The owner formerly was a terrible mysterious party--never

lived here--hardly ever was seen here except in the month of

September, as I might say.'



The horses were started again, and noise rendered further

discourse a matter of too great exertion.  Stephen crept inside

under the tilt, and was soon lost in reverie.



Three hours and a half of straining up hills and jogging down

brought them to St. Launce's, the market town and railway station

nearest to Endelstow, and the place from which Stephen Smith had

journeyed over the downs on the, to him, memorable winter evening

at the beginning of the same year.  The carrier's van was so timed

as to meet a starting up-train, which Stephen entered.  Two or

three hours' railway travel through vertical cuttings in

metamorphic rock, through oak copses rich and green, stretching

over slopes and down delightful valleys, glens, and ravines,

sparkling with water like many-rilled Ida, and he plunged amid the

hundred and fifty thousand people composing the town of Plymouth.



There being some time upon his hands he left his luggage at the

cloak-room, and went on foot along Bedford Street to the nearest

church.  Here Stephen wandered among the multifarious tombstones

and looked in at the chancel window, dreaming of something that

was likely to happen by the altar there in the course of the

coming month.  He turned away and ascended the Hoe, viewed the

magnificent stretch of sea and massive promontories of land, but

without particularly discerning one feature of the varied

perspective.  He still saw that inner prospect--the event he hoped

for in yonder church.  The wide Sound, the Breakwater, the light-

house on far-off Eddystone, the dark steam vessels, brigs,

barques, and schooners, either floating stilly, or gliding with

tiniest motion, were as the dream, then; the dreamed-of event was

as the reality.



Soon Stephen went down from the Hoe, and returned to the railway

station.  He took his ticket, and entered the London train.





That day was an irksome time at Endelstow vicarage.  Neither

father nor daughter alluded to the departure of Stephen.  Mr.

Swancourt's manner towards her partook of the compunctious

kindness that arises from a misgiving as to the justice of some

previous act.



Either from lack of the capacity to grasp the whole coup d'oeil,

or from a natural endowment for certain kinds of stoicism, women

are cooler than men in critical situations of the passive form.

Probably, in Elfride's case at least, it was blindness to the

greater contingencies of the future she was preparing for herself,

which enabled her to ask her father in a quiet voice if he could

give her a holiday soon, to ride to St. Launce's and go on to

Plymouth.



Now, she had only once before gone alone to Plymouth, and that was

in consequence of some unavoidable difficulty.  Being a country

girl, and a good, not to say a wild, horsewoman, it had been her

delight to canter, without the ghost of an attendant, over the

fourteen or sixteen miles of hard road intervening between their

home and the station at St. Launce's, put up the horse, and go on

the remainder of the distance by train, returning in the same

manner in the evening.  It was then resolved that, though she had

successfully accomplished this journey once, it was not to be

repeated without some attendance.



But Elfride must not be confounded with ordinary young feminine

equestrians.  The circumstances of her lonely and narrow life made

it imperative that in trotting about the neighbourhood she must

trot alone or else not at all.  Usage soon rendered this perfectly

natural to herself.  Her father, who had had other experiences,

did not much like the idea of a Swancourt, whose pedigree could be

as distinctly traced as a thread in a skein of silk, scampering

over the hills like a farmer's daughter, even though he could

habitually neglect her.  But what with his not being able to

afford her a regular attendant, and his inveterate habit of

letting anything be to save himself trouble, the circumstance grew

customary.  And so there arose a chronic notion in the villagers'

minds that all ladies rode without an attendant, like Miss

Swancourt, except a few who were sometimes visiting at Lord

Luxellian's.



'I don't like your going to Plymouth alone, particularly going to

St. Launce's on horseback.  Why not drive, and take the man?'



'It is not nice to be so overlooked.' Worm's company would not

seriously have interfered with her plans, but it was her humour to

go without him.



'When do you want to go?' said her father.



She only answered, 'Soon.'



'I will consider,' he said.



Only a few days elapsed before she asked again.  A letter had

reached her from Stephen.  It had been timed to come on that day

by special arrangement between them.  In it he named the earliest

morning on which he could meet her at Plymouth.  Her father had

been on a journey to Stratleigh, and returned in unusual buoyancy

of spirit.  It was a good opportunity; and since the dismissal of

Stephen her father had been generally in a mood to make small

concessions, that he might steer clear of large ones connected

with that outcast lover of hers.



'Next Thursday week I am going from home in a different

direction,' said her father.  'In fact, I shall leave home the

night before.  You might choose the same day, for they wish to

take up the carpets, or some such thing, I think.  As I said, I

don't like you to be seen in a town on horseback alone; but go if

you will.'



Thursday week.  Her father had named the very day that Stephen

also had named that morning as the earliest on which it would be

of any use to meet her; that was, about fifteen days from the day

on which he had left Endelstow.  Fifteen days--that fragment of

duration which has acquired such an interesting individuality from

its connection with the English marriage law.



She involuntarily looked at her father so strangely, that on

becoming conscious of the look she paled with embarrassment.  Her

father, too, looked confused.  What was he thinking of?



There seemed to be a special facility offered her by a power

external to herself in the circumstance that Mr. Swancourt had

proposed to leave home the night previous to her wished-for day.

Her father seldom took long journeys; seldom slept from home

except perhaps on the night following a remote Visitation.  Well,

she would not inquire too curiously into the reason of the

opportunity, nor did he, as would have been natural, proceed to

explain it of his own accord.  In matters of fact there had

hitherto been no reserve between them, though they were not

usually confidential in its full sense.  But the divergence of

their emotions on Stephen's account had produced an estrangement

which just at present went even to the extent of reticence on the

most ordinary household topics.



Elfride was almost unconsciously relieved, persuading herself that

her father's reserve on his business justified her in secrecy as

regarded her own--a secrecy which was necessarily a foregone

decision with her.  So anxious is a young conscience to discover a

palliative, that the ex post facto nature of a reason is of no

account in excluding it.



The intervening fortnight was spent by her mostly in walking by

herself among the shrubs and trees, indulging sometimes in

sanguine anticipations; more, far more frequently, in misgivings.

All her flowers seemed dull of hue; her pets seemed to look

wistfully into her eyes, as if they no longer stood in the same

friendly relation to her as formerly.  She wore melancholy

jewellery, gazed at sunsets, and talked to old men and women.  It

was the first time that she had had an inner and private world

apart from the visible one about her.  She wished that her father,

instead of neglecting her even more than usual, would make some

advance--just one word; she would then tell all, and risk

Stephen's displeasure.  Thus brought round to the youth again, she

saw him in her fancy, standing, touching her, his eyes full of sad

affection, hopelessly renouncing his attempt because she had

renounced hers; and she could not recede.



On the Wednesday she was to receive another letter.  She had

resolved to let her father see the arrival of this one, be the

consequences what they might: the dread of losing her lover by

this deed of honesty prevented her acting upon the resolve.  Five

minutes before the postman's expected arrival she slipped out, and

down the lane to meet him.  She met him immediately upon turning a

sharp angle, which hid her from view in the direction of the

vicarage.  The man smilingly handed one missive, and was going on

to hand another, a circular from some tradesman.



'No,' she said; 'take that on to the house.'



'Why, miss, you are doing what your father has done for the last

fortnight.'



She did not comprehend.



'Why, come to this corner, and take a letter of me every morning,

all writ in the same handwriting, and letting any others for him

go on to the house.' And on the postman went.



No sooner had he turned the corner behind her back than she heard

her father meet and address the man.  She had saved her letter by

two minutes.  Her father audibly went through precisely the same

performance as she had just been guilty of herself.



This stealthy conduct of his was, to say the least, peculiar.





Given an impulsive inconsequent girl, neglected as to her inner

life by her only parent, and the following forces alive within

her; to determine a resultant:



First love acted upon by a deadly fear of separation from its

object: inexperience, guiding onward a frantic wish to prevent the

above-named issue: misgivings as to propriety, met by hope of

ultimate exoneration: indignation at parental inconsistency in

first encouraging, then forbidding: a chilling sense of

disobedience, overpowered by a conscientious inability to brook a

breaking of plighted faith with a man who, in essentials, had

remained unaltered from the beginning: a blessed hope that

opposition would turn an erroneous judgement: a bright faith that

things would mend thereby, and wind up well.



Probably the result would, after all, have been nil, had not the

following few remarks been made one day at breakfast.



Her father was in his old hearty spirits.  He smiled to himself at

stories too bad to tell, and called Elfride a little scamp for

surreptitiously preserving some blind kittens that ought to have

been drowned.  After this expression, she said to him suddenly:



If Mr. Smith had been already in the family, you would not have

been made wretched by discovering he had poor relations?'



'Do you mean in the family by marriage?' he replied inattentively,

and continuing to peel his egg.



The accumulating scarlet told that was her meaning, as much as the

affirmative reply.



'I should have put up with it, no doubt,' Mr. Swancourt observed.



'So that you would not have been driven into hopeless melancholy,

but have made the best of him?'



Elfride's erratic mind had from her youth upwards been constantly

in the habit of perplexing her father by hypothetical questions,

based on absurd conditions.  The present seemed to be cast so

precisely in the mould of previous ones that, not being given to

syntheses of circumstances, he answered it with customary

complacency.



'If he were allied to us irretrievably, of course I, or any

sensible man, should accept conditions that could not be altered;

certainly not be hopelessly melancholy about it.  I don't believe

anything in the world would make me hopelessly melancholy.  And

don't let anything make you so, either.'



'I won't, papa,' she cried, with a serene brightness that pleased

him.



Certainly Mr. Swancourt must have been far from thinking that the

brightness came from an exhilarating intention to hold back no

longer from the mad action she had planned.



In the evening he drove away towards Stratleigh, quite alone.  It

was an unusual course for him.  At the door Elfride had been again

almost impelled by her feelings to pour out all.



'Why are you going to Stratleigh, papa?' she said, and looked at

him longingly.



'I will tell you to-morrow when I come back,' he said cheerily;

'not before then, Elfride.  Thou wilt not utter what thou dost not

know, and so far will I trust thee, gentle Elfride.'



She was repressed and hurt.



'I will tell you my errand to Plymouth, too, when I come back,'

she murmured.



He went away.  His jocularity made her intention seem the lighter,

as his indifference made her more resolved to do as she liked.



It was a familiar September sunset, dark-blue fragments of cloud

upon an orange-yellow sky.  These sunsets used to tempt her to

walk towards them, as any beautiful thing tempts a near approach.

She went through the field to the privet hedge, clambered into the

middle of it, and reclined upon the thick boughs.  After looking

westward for a considerable time, she blamed herself for not

looking eastward to where Stephen was, and turned round.

Ultimately her eyes fell upon the ground.



A peculiarity was observable beneath her.  A green field spread

itself on each side of the hedge, one belonging to the glebe, the

other being a part of the land attached to the manor-house

adjoining.  On the vicarage side she saw a little footpath, the

distinctive and altogether exceptional feature of which consisted

in its being only about ten yards long; it terminated abruptly at

each end.



A footpath, suddenly beginning and suddenly ending, coming from

nowhere and leading nowhere, she had never seen before.



Yes, she had, on second thoughts.  She had seen exactly such a

path trodden in the front of barracks by the sentry.



And this recollection explained the origin of the path here.  Her

father had trodden it by pacing up and down, as she had once seen

him doing.



Sitting on the hedge as she sat now, her eyes commanded a view of

both sides of it.  And a few minutes later, Elfride looked over to

the manor side.



Here was another sentry path.  It was like the first in length,

and it began and ended exactly opposite the beginning and ending

of its neighbour, but it was thinner, and less distinct.



Two reasons existed for the difference.  This one might have been

trodden by a similar weight of tread to the other, exercised a

less number of times; or it might have been walked just as

frequently, but by lighter feet.



Probably a gentleman from Scotland-yard, had he been passing at

the time, might have considered the latter alternative as the more

probable.  Elfride thought otherwise, so far as she thought at

all.  But her own great To-Morrow was now imminent; all thoughts

inspired by casual sights of the eye were only allowed to exercise

themselves in inferior corners of her brain, previously to being

banished altogether.



Elfride was at length compelled to reason practically upon her

undertaking.  All her definite perceptions thereon, when the

emotion accompanying them was abstracted, amounted to no more than

these:



'Say an hour and three-quarters to ride to St. Launce's.



'Say half an hour at the Falcon to change my dress.



'Say two hours waiting for some train and getting to Plymouth.



'Say an hour to spare before twelve o'clock.



'Total time from leaving Endelstow till twelve o'clock, five

hours.



'Therefore I shall have to start at seven.'





No surprise or sense of unwontedness entered the minds of the

servants at her early ride.  The monotony of life we associate

with people of small incomes in districts out of the sound of the

railway whistle, has one exception, which puts into shade the

experience of dwellers about the great centres of population--that

is, in travelling.  Every journey there is more or less an

adventure; adventurous hours are necessarily chosen for the most

commonplace outing.  Miss Elfride had to leave early--that was

all.



Elfride never went out on horseback but she brought home

something--something found, or something bought.  If she trotted

to town or village, her burden was books.  If to hills, woods, or

the seashore, it was wonderful mosses, abnormal twigs, a

handkerchief of wet shells or seaweed.



Once, in muddy weather, when Pansy was walking with her down the

street of Castle Boterel, on a fair-day, a packet in front of her

and a packet under her arm, an accident befell the packets, and

they slipped down.  On one side of her, three volumes of fiction

lay kissing the mud; on the other numerous skeins of polychromatic

wools lay absorbing it.  Unpleasant women smiled through windows

at the mishap, the men all looked round, and a boy, who was

minding a ginger-bread stall whilst the owner had gone to get

drunk, laughed loudly.  The blue eyes turned to sapphires, and the

cheeks crimsoned with vexation.



After that misadventure she set her wits to work, and was

ingenious enough to invent an arrangement of small straps about

the saddle, by which a great deal could be safely carried thereon,

in a small compass.  Here she now spread out and fastened a plain

dark walking-dress and a few other trifles of apparel.  Worm

opened the gate for her, and she vanished away.



One of the brightest mornings of late summer shone upon her.  The

heather was at its purplest, the furze at its yellowest, the

grasshoppers chirped loud enough for birds, the snakes hissed like

little engines, and Elfride at first felt lively.  Sitting at ease

upon Pansy, in her orthodox riding-habit and nondescript hat, she

looked what she felt.  But the mercury of those days had a trick

of falling unexpectedly.  First, only for one minute in ten had

she a sense of depression.  Then a large cloud, that had been

hanging in the north like a black fleece, came and placed itself

between her and the sun.  It helped on what was already

inevitable, and she sank into a uniformity of sadness.



She turned in the saddle and looked back.  They were now on an

open table-land, whose altitude still gave her a view of the sea

by Endelstow.  She looked longingly at that spot.



During this little revulsion of feeling Pansy had been still

advancing, and Elfride felt it would be absurd to turn her little

mare's head the other way.  'Still,' she thought, 'if I had a

mamma at home I WOULD go back!'



And making one of those stealthy movements by which women let

their hearts juggle with their brains, she did put the horse's

head about, as if unconsciously, and went at a hand-gallop towards

home for more than a mile.  By this time, from the inveterate

habit of valuing what we have renounced directly the alternative

is chosen, the thought of her forsaken Stephen recalled her, and

she turned about, and cantered on to St. Launce's again.



This miserable strife of thought now began to rage in all its

wildness.  Overwrought and trembling, she dropped the rein upon

Pansy's shoulders, and vowed she would be led whither the horse

would take her.



Pansy slackened her pace to a walk, and walked on with her

agitated burden for three or four minutes.  At the expiration of

this time they had come to a little by-way on the right, leading

down a slope to a pool of water.  The pony stopped, looked towards

the pool, and then advanced and stooped to drink.



Elfride looked at her watch and discovered that if she were going

to reach St. Launce's early enough to change her dress at the

Falcon, and get a chance of some early train to Plymouth--there

were only two available--it was necessary to proceed at once.



She was impatient.  It seemed as if Pansy would never stop

drinking; and the repose of the pool, the idle motions of the

insects and flies upon it, the placid waving of the flags, the

leaf-skeletons, like Genoese filigree, placidly sleeping at the

bottom, by their contrast with her own turmoil made her impatience

greater.



Pansy did turn at last, and went up the slope again to the high-

road.  The pony came upon it, and stood cross-wise, looking up and

down.  Elfride's heart throbbed erratically, and she thought,

'Horses, if left to themselves, make for where they are best fed.

Pansy will go home.'



Pansy turned and walked on towards St. Launce's



Pansy at home, during summer, had little but grass to live on.

After a run to St. Launce's she always had a feed of corn to

support her on the return journey.  Therefore, being now more than

half way, she preferred St. Launce's.



But Elfride did not remember this now.  All she cared to recognize

was a dreamy fancy that to-day's rash action was not her own.  She

was disabled by her moods, and it seemed indispensable to adhere

to the programme.  So strangely involved are motives that, more

than by her promise to Stephen, more even than by her love, she

was forced on by a sense of the necessity of keeping faith with

herself, as promised in the inane vow of ten minutes ago.



She hesitated no longer.  Pansy went, like the steed of Adonis, as

if she told the steps.  Presently the quaint gables and jumbled

roofs of St. Launce's were spread beneath her, and going down the

hill she entered the courtyard of the Falcon.  Mrs. Buckle, the

landlady, came to the door to meet her.



The Swancourts were well known here.  The transition from

equestrian to the ordinary guise of railway travellers had been

more than once performed by father and daughter in this

establishment.



In less than a quarter of an hour Elfride emerged from the door in

her walking dress, and went to the railway.  She had not told Mrs.

Buckle anything as to her intentions, and was supposed to have

gone out shopping.



An hour and forty minutes later, and she was in Stephen's arms at

the Plymouth station.  Not upon the platform--in the secret

retreat of a deserted waiting-room.



Stephen's face boded ill.  He was pale and despondent.



What is the matter?' she asked.



'We cannot be married here to-day, my Elfie! I ought to have known

it and stayed here.  In my ignorance I did not.  I have the

licence, but it can only be used in my parish in London.  I only

came down last night, as you know.'



'What shall we do?' she said blankly.



'There's only one thing we can do, darling.'



'What's that?'



'Go on to London by a train just starting, and be married there

to-morrow.'



'Passengers for the 11.5 up-train take their seats!' said a

guard's voice on the platform.



'Will you go, Elfride?'



'I will.'



In three minutes the train had moved off, bearing away with it

Stephen and Elfride.
