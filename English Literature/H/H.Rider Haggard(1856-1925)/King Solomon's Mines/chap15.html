CHAPTER XV</H2>

<H3>
GOOD FALLS SICK</H3>
AFTER the fight was ended Sir Henry and Good were carried into Twala's
hut, where I joined them. They were both utterly exhausted by exertion
and loss of blood, and, indeed, my own condition was little better. I am
very wiry, and can stand more fatigue than most men, probably on account
of my light weight and long training; but that night I was fairly done
up, and, as is always the case with me when exhausted, that old wound the
lion gave me began to pain me. Also my. head was aching violently from
the blow I had received in the morning, when I was knocked senseless. Altogether,
a more miserable trio than we were that evening it would have been difficult
to discover; and our only comfort lay in the reflection that we were exceedingly
fortunate to be there to feel miserable, instead of being stretched dead
upon the plain, as so many thousands of brave men were that night, who
had risen well and strong in the morning. Somehow, with the assistance
of the beautiful Foulata, who, since we had been the means of saving her
life, had constituted herself our handmaiden, and especially Good's, we
managed to get off the chain shirts, which had certainly saved the lives
of two of us that day, when we found that the flesh underneath was terribly
bruised, for though the steel links had prevented the weapons from entering,
they had not prevented them from bruising. Both Sir Henry and Good were
a mass of bruises, and I was by no means free. As a remedy Foulata brought
us some pounded green leaves with an aromatic odor, which, when applied
as a plaster, gave us considerable relief. But though the bruises were
painful, they did not give us such anxiety as Sir Henry's and Good's wounds.
Good had a hole right through the fleshy part of his "beautiful white leg,"
from which he had lost a great deal of blood; and Sir Henry had a deep
cut over the jaw, inflicted by Twala's battle-axe. Luckily Good was a very
decent surgeon, and as soon as his small box of medicines was forthcoming,
he, having thoroughly cleansed the wounds, managed to stitch up first Sir
Henry's and then his own pretty satisfactorily, considering the imperfect
light given by the primitive Kukuana lamp in the hut. Afterwards he plentifully
smeared the wounds with some antiseptic ointment, of which there was a
pot in the little box, and we covered them with the remains of a pocket-handkerchief
which we possessed.

<P>&nbsp;Meanwhile Foulata had prepared us some strong broth, for we were
too weary to eat. This we swallowed, and then threw ourselves down on the
piles of magnificent karosses, or fur rags, which were scattered about
the dead king's great hut. By a very strange instance of the irony of fate,
it was on Twala's own couch, and wrapped in Twala's own particular kaross,
that Sir Henry, the man who had slain him, slept that night.

<P>&nbsp;I say slept; but after that day's work sleep was indeed difficult.
To begin with, in very truth the air was full

<P>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Of farewells to the dying
<BR>And mournings for the dead."</BLOCKQUOTE>
From every direction came the sound of the wailing of women whose husbands,
sons, and brothers had perished in the fight. No wonder that they wailed,
for over twenty thousand men, or nearly a third of the Kukuana army, had
been destroyed in that awful struggle. It was heart-rending to lie and
listen to their cries for those who would never return; and it made one
realize the full horror of the work done that day to further man's ambition.
Towards midnight, however, the ceaseless crying of the women grew less
frequent, till at length the silence was only broken at intervals of a
few minutes by a long, piercing howl that came from a hut in our immediate
rear, and which I afterwards discovered proceeded from Gagool wailing for
the dead king, Twala.

<P>&nbsp;After that I got a little fitful sleep, only to awake from time
to time with a start, thinking that I was once more an actor in the terrible
events of the last twenty-four hours. Now I seemed to see that warrior,
whom my hand had sent to his last account, charging at me on the mountain-top;
now I was once more in that glorious ring of Grays, which made its immortal
stand against all Twala's regiments, upon the little mound; and now again
I saw Twala's plumed and gory head roll past my feet with gnashing teeth
and glaring eye. At last, somehow or other, the night passed away; but
when dawn broke I found that my companions had slept no better than myself.
Good, indeed, was in a high fever, and very soon afterwards began to grow
light-headed, and also, to my alarm, to spit blood, the result, no doubt,
of some internal injury inflicted by the desperate efforts made by the
Kukuana warrior on the previous day to get his big spear through the chain
armor. Sir Henry, however, seemed pretty fresh, notwithstanding the wound
on his face, which made eating difficult and laughter an impossibility,
though he was so sore and stiff that he could scarcely stir.

<P>&nbsp;About eight o'clock we had a visit from Infadoos, who seemed but
little the worse - tough old warrior that he was for his exertions on the
previous day, though he informed us he had been up all night. He was delighted
to see us, though much grieved at Good's condition, and shook hands cordially;
but I noticed that he addressed Sir Henry with a kind of reverence, as
though he were something more than man; and indeed, as we afterwards found
out, the great Englishman was looked on throughout Kukuanaland as a supernatural
being. No man, the soldiers said, could have fought as he fought, or could,
at the end of a day of such toil and bloodshed, have slain Twala, who,
in addition to being the king, was supposed to be the strongest warrior
in Kukuanaland, in single combat, sheering through his bull-neck at a stroke.
Indeed, that stroke became proverbial in Kukuanaland, and any extraordinary
blow or feat of strength was thenceforth known as "Incubu's blow."

<P>&nbsp;Infadoos told us also that all Twala's regiments had submitted
to Ignosi, and that like submissions were beginning to arrive from chiefs
in the country. Twala's death at the hands of Sir Henry had put an end
to all further chance of disturbance; for Scragga had been his, only son,
and there was no rival claimant left alive.

<P>&nbsp;I remarked that Ignosi had swum to the throne through blood. The
old chief shrugged his shoulders. "Yes," he answered; "but the Kukuana
people can only be kept cool by letting the blood flow sometimes. Many
were killed, indeed, but the women were left, and others would soon grow
up to take the places of the fallen. After this the land would be quiet
for a while."

<P>&nbsp;Afterwards, in the course of the morning, we had a short visit
from Ignosi, on whose brows the royal diadem was now bound. As I contemplated
him advancing with kingly dignity, an obsequious guard following his steps,
I could not help recalling to my mind the tall Zulu who had presented himself
to us at Durban some few months back, asking to be taken into our service,
and reflecting on the strange revolutions of the wheel of fortune.

<P>&nbsp;"Hail, O king!" I said, rising.

<P>&nbsp;"YES, Macumazahn. King at last, by the grace of your three right
hands," was the ready answer.

<P>&nbsp;All was, he said, going on well; and he hoped to arrange a great
feast in two weeks' time, in order to show himself to the people.

<P>&nbsp;I asked him what he had settled to do with Gagool.

<P>&nbsp;"She is the evil genius of the land," he answered, "and I shall
kill her, and all the witch-doctors with her! She has lived so long that
none can remember when she was not old, and always she it is who has trained
the witch-hunters, and made the land evil in the sight of the heavens above."

<P>&nbsp;"Yet she knows much," I replied; "it is easier to destroy knowledge,
Ignosi, than to gather it."

<P>&nbsp;"It is so," he said, thoughtfully. "She, and she only, knows the
secret of the `Three Witches' yonder, whither the great road runs, where
the kings were buried, and the silent ones sit."

<P>&nbsp;"Yes, and the diamonds are. Forget not thy promise, Ignosi; thou
must lead us to the mines, even if thou hast to spare Gagool alive to show
the way."

<P>&nbsp;"I will not forget, Macumazahn, and I will think on what thou
sayest."

<P>&nbsp;After Ignosi's visit I went to see Good, and found him quite delirious.
The fever from his wound seemed to have taken a firm hold of his system,
and to be complicated by an internal injury. For four or five days his
condition was most critical; indeed, I firmly believe that had it not been
for Foulata's indefatigable nursing he must have died.

<P>&nbsp;Women are women, all the world over, whatever their color. Yet
somehow it seemed curious to watch this dusky beauty bending night and
day over the fevered man's couch, and performing all the merciful errands
of the sick-room as swiftly, gently, and with as fine an instinct as a
trained hospital nurse. For the first night or two I tried to help her,
and so did Sir Henry so soon as his stiffness allowed him to move, but
she bore our interference with impatience, and finally insisted upon our
leaving him to her, saying that our movements made him restless, which
I think was true. Day and night she watched and tended him, giving him
his only medicine, a native cooling drink made of milk, in which was infused
the juice of the bulb of a species of tulip, and keeping the flies from
settling on him. I can see the whole picture now as it appeared night after
night by the light of our primitive lamp, Good tossing to and fro, his
features emaciated, his eyes shining large and luminous, and jabbering
nonsense by the yard; and seated on the ground by his side, her back resting
against the wall of the hut, the soft-eyed, shapely Kukuana beauty, her
whole face, weary as it was, animated by a look of infinite compassion
- or was it something more than compassion?

<P>&nbsp;For two days we thought that he must die, and crept about with
heavy hearts.

<P>&nbsp;Only Foulata would not believe it.

<P>&nbsp;"He will live," she said.

<P>&nbsp;For three hundred yards or more around Twala's chief hut, where
the sufferer lay, there was silence; for by the king's order all who lived
in the habitations behind it had, except Sir Henry and myself, been removed,
lest any noise should come to the sick man's ear. One night, it was the
fifth night of his illness, as was my habit I went across to see how he
was getting on before turning in for a few hours.

<P>&nbsp;I entered the hut carefully. The lamp placed upon the floor showed
the figure of Good, tossing no more, but lying quite still.

<P>&nbsp;So it had come at last! and in the bitterness of my heart I gave
something like a sob.

<P>&nbsp;"Hush - h - h!" came from the patch of dark shadow behind Good's
head.

<P>&nbsp;Then, creeping closer; I saw that he was not dead, but sleeping
soundly, with Foulata's taper fingers clasped tightly in his poor white
hand, The crisis had passed, and he would live. He slept like that for
eighteen hours; and I scarcely like to say it, for fear I should not be
believed, but during that entire period did that devoted girl sit by him,
fearing that if she moved and drew away her hand it would wake him. What
she must have suffered from cramp, stiffness, and weariness, to say nothing
of want of food, nobody will ever know; but it is a fact that, when at
last he woke, she had to be carried away - her limbs were so stiff that
she could not move them.

<P>&nbsp;After the turn had once been taken, Good's recovery was rapid
and complete. It was not till he was nearly well that Sir Henry told him
of all he owed to Foulata; and when he came to the story of how she sat
by his side for eighteen hours fearing lest by moving she should wake him,
the honest sailor's eyes filled with tears. He turned and went straight
to the hut where Foulata was preparing the midday meal (we were back in
our old quarters now), taking me with him to interpret in case he could
not make his meaning clear to her, though I am bound to say she understood
him marvellously as a rule, considering how extremely limited was his foreign
vocabulary.

<P>&nbsp;"Tell her," said Good, "that I owe her my life, and that I will
never forget her kindness."

<P>&nbsp;I interpreted, and under her dark skin she actually seemed to
blush.

<P>&nbsp;Turning to him with one of those swift and graceful motions that
in her always reminded me of the flight of a wild bird, she answered softly,
glancing at him with her large brown eyes:

<P>&nbsp;"Nay, my lord; my lord forgets! Did he not save my life, and am
I not my lord's handmaiden?"

<P>&nbsp;It will be observed that the young lady appeared to have entirely
forgotten the share which Sir Henry and myself had had in her preservation
from Twala's clutches. But that is the way of women! I remember my dear
wife was just the same. I retired from that little interview sad at heart.
I did not like Miss Foulata's soft glances, for I knew the fatal amorous
propensities of sailors in general, and Good in particular.

<P>&nbsp;There are two things in the world, as I have found it, which cannot
be prevented: you cannot keep a Zulu from fighting, or a sailor from falling
in love upon the slightest provocation!

<P>&nbsp;It was a few days after this last occurrence that Ignosi held
his great "indaba" (council), and was formally recognized as king by the
"indunas" (head men) of Kukuanaland. The spectacle was a most imposing
one, including, as it did, a great review of troops. On this day the remaining
fragment of the Grays were formally paraded, and in the face of the army
thanked for their splendid conduct in the great battle. To each man the
king made a large present of cattle, promoting them one and all to the
rank of officers in the new corps of Grays which was in process of formation.
An order was also promulgated throughout the length and breadth of Kukuanaland
that, while we honored the country with our presence, we three were to
be greeted with the royal salute, to be treated with the same ceremony
and respect that was by custom accorded to the king, and the power of life
and death was publicly conferred upon us. Ignosi, too, in the presence
of his people, reaffirmed the promises that he had made, to the effect
that no man's blood should be shed without trial, and that witch-hunting
should cease in the land.

<P>&nbsp;When the ceremony was over we waited upon Ignosi, and informed
him that we were now anxious to investigate the mystery of the mines to
which Solomon's Road ran, asking him if he had discovered anything about
them.

<P>&nbsp;"My friends," he answered, "this have I discovered. It is there
that the three great figures sit, who here are called the `Silent Ones,'
and to whom Twala would have offered the girl, Foulata, as a sacrifice.
It is there, too, in a great cave deep in the mountain, that the kings
of the land are buried; there ye shall find Twala's body, sitting with
those who went before him. There, too, is a great pit which, at some time,
long dead men dug out, mayhap for the stones ye speak of, such as I have
heard men in Natal speak of at Kimberley. There, too, in the Place of Death
is a secret chamber, known to none but the king and Gagool. But Twala,
who knew it, is dead, and I know it not, nor know I what is in it. But
there is a legend in the land that once, many generations gone, a white
man crossed the mountains, and was led by a woman to the secret chamber
and shown the wealth, but before he could take it she betrayed him, and
he was driven by the king of the day back to the mountains, and since then
no man has entered the chamber."

<P>&nbsp;"The story is surely true, Ignosi, for on the mountain we found
the white man," I said.

<P>&nbsp;"Yes, we found him. And now I have promised ye that if ye can
find that chamber, and the stones are there - "

<P>&nbsp;"The, stone upon thy forehead proves that they are there," I put
in, pointing to the great diamond I had taken from Twala's dead brows.

<P>&nbsp;"Mayhap; if they are there," he said, "ye shall have as many as
ye can take hence - if, indeed, ye would leave me, my brothers." "First
we must find the chamber," said I.

<P>&nbsp;"There is but one who can show it to thee - Gagool.',

<P>&nbsp;"And if she will not?"

<P>&nbsp;"Then shall she die," said Ignosi, sternly. "I have saved her
alive but for this. Stay, she shall choose," and, calling to a messenger,
he ordered Gagool to be brought.

<P>&nbsp;In a few minutes she came, hurried along by two guards, whom she
was cursing as she walked.

<P>&nbsp;"Leave her," said the king to the guards.

<P>&nbsp;As soon as their support was withdrawn the withered old bundle,
for she looked more like a bundle than anything else, sank into a heap
on the floor out of which her two bright, wicked eyes gleamed like a snake's.

<P>&nbsp;"What will ye with me, Ignosi?" she piped. "Ye dare not touch
me. If ye touch me I will blast ye as ye sit. Beware of my magic."

<P>&nbsp;"Thy magic could not save Twala, old she-wolf, and it cannot hurt
me." was the answer. "Listen: I will this of thee, that thou reveal where
is the chamber where are the shining stones."

<P>&nbsp;"Ha! ha!" she piped, "none know but I, and I will never tell thee.
The white devils shall go hence empty-handed."

<P>&nbsp;"Thou wilt tell me. I will make thee tell me."

<P>&nbsp;"How, O king? Thou art great, but can thy power wring the truth
from a woman?"

<P>&nbsp;"It is difficult, yet will I do it."

<P>&nbsp;"How, O king?"

<P>&nbsp;"Nay, thus; if thou tellest not thou shalt slowly die."

<P>&nbsp;"Die!" she shrieked, in terror and fury; "ye dare not touch me
man, ye know not who I am. How old think ye am I? I knew your fathers,
and your fathers' fathers' fathers. When the country was young I was here,
when the country grows old I shall still be here. I cannot die unless I
be killed by chance, for none dare slay me."

<P>&nbsp;"Yet will I slay thee. See, Gagool, mother of evil, thou art so
old thou canst no longer love thy life: What can life be to such a hag
as thee, who hast no shape, nor form, nor hair, nor teeth - hast naught,
save wickedness and evil eyes? It will be mercy to slay thee, Gagool."

<P>&nbsp;"Thou fool," shrieked the old fiend, "thou accursed fool, thinkest
thou that life is sweet only to the young? It is not so, and naught thou
knowest of the heart of man to think it. To the young, indeed, death is
sometimes welcome, for the young can feel. They love and suffer, and it
wrings them to see their beloved pass to the land of shadows. But the old
feel not, they love not, and, ha! they laugh to see another go out into
the dark; ha! ha! they laugh to see the evil that is done under the sun.
All they love is life, the warm, warm sun, and the sweet, sweet air. They
are afraid of the cold; afraid of the cold and the dark, ha! ha! ha!" and
the old hag writhed in ghastly merriment on the ground.

<P>&nbsp;"Cease thine evil talk and answer me," said Ignosi, angrily. "Wilt
thou show the place where the stones are, or wilt thou not? If thou wilt
not, thou diest, even now," and he seized a spear and held it over her.

<P>&nbsp;"I will not show it; thou darest not kill me, darest not. He who
slays me. will be accursed forever."

<P>&nbsp;Slowly Ignosi brought down the spear till it pricked the prostrate
heap of rags.

<P>&nbsp;With a wild yell she sprang to her feet, and then again fell and
rolled upon the floor.

<P>&nbsp;"Nay; I will show it. Only let me live, let me sit in the sun
and have a bit of meat to suck, and I will show thee."

<P>&nbsp;"It is well. I thought I should find a way to reason with thee.
To-morrow shalt thou go with Infadoos and my white brothers to the place,
and beware how thou failest, for if thou showest it not, then shalt thou
slowly die. I have spoken."

<P>&nbsp;"1 will not fail, Ignosi. I always keep my word: <I>ha! ha! ha!</I>
Once a woman showed the place to a white man before, and behold evil befell
him," and here her wicked eyes glinted. "Her name was Gagool, too. Perchance
I was that woman."

<P>&nbsp;"Thou liest," I said, "that was ten generations gone."

<P>&nbsp;"Mayhap, mayhap; when one lives long one forgets. Perhaps it was
my mother's mother who told me; surely her name was Gagool, also, But mark,
ye will find in the place where the bright playthings are a bag of hide
full of stones. The man filled that bag, but he never took it away. Evil
befell him, I say; evil befell him! Perhaps it was my mother's mother who
told me. It will be a merry journey - we can see the bodies of those who
died in the battle as we go. Their eyes will be gone by now, and their
ribs will be hollow. Ha! ha! ha!"
