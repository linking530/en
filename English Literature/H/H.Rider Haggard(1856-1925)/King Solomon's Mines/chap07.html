CHAPTER VII</H2>

<H3>
SOLOMON'S ROAD</H3>
Outside the cave we halted, feeling rather foolish.

<P>&nbsp;"I am going back," said Sir Henry. "Why?" asked Good. "Because
it has struck me that - what we saw - may be my brother."

<P>&nbsp;This was a new idea, and we reentered the cave to put it to the
proof, After the bright light outside our eyes, weak as they were with
stating at the snow, could not for a while pierce the gloom of the cave.
Presently, however, we grew accustomed to the semi-darkness, and advanced
on to the dead form.

<P>&nbsp;Sir Henry knelt down and peered into its face.

<P>&nbsp;"Thank God," he said, with a sigh of relief, "it is not my brother."

<P>&nbsp;Then I went and looked. The corpse was that of a tall man in middle
life, with aquiline features, grizzled hair, and a long black mustache.
The skin was perfectly yellow, and stretched tightly over the bones. Its
clothing, with the exception of what seemed to be the remains of a pair
of woollen hose, had been removed, leaving the skeleton-like frame naked.
Round the neck hung a yellow ivory crucifix. The corpse was frozen perfectly
stiff.

<P>&nbsp;"Who on earth can it be?" said I.

<P>&nbsp;"Can't you guess?" asked Good.

<P>&nbsp;I shook my head.

<P>&nbsp;"Why, the old don, Jos&eacute; da Silvestra, of course - who else?"

<P>&nbsp;"Impossible," I gasped, "he died three hundred years ago."

<P>&nbsp;"And what is there to prevent his lasting for three thousand years
in this atmosphere I should like to know?" asked Good. "If only the air
is cold enough flesh and blood will keep as fresh as New Zealand mutton
forever, and Heaven knows it is cold enough here. The sun never gets in
here; no animal comes here to tear or destroy. No doubt his slave, of whom
he speaks on the map, took off his clothes and left him. He could not have
buried him alone. Look here," he went. on, stooping down and picking up
a queer-shaped bone scraped at the end into a sharp point, "here is the
`cleft-bone' that he used to draw the map with."

<P>&nbsp;We gazed astonished for a moment, forgetting our own miseries
in the extraordinary and, as it seemed to us, semi-miraculous sight.

<P>&nbsp;"Ay," said "Sir Henry, "and here is where he got his ink from,"
and he pointed to a small wound on the dead man's left arm. "Did ever man
see such a thing before?"

<P>&nbsp;There was no longer any doubt about the matter, which I confess,
for my own part, perfectly appalled me. There he sat, the dead man, whose
directions, written some ten generations ago, bad led us to this spot.
There in my own hand was the rude pen with which he had written them, and
there round his neck was the crucifix his dying lips had kissed. Gazing
at him my imagination could reconstruct the whole scene: the traveller
dying of cold and starvation, and yet striving to convey the great secret
he had discovered to the world; the awful loneliness of his death, of which
the evidence sat before us. It even seemed to me that I could trace in
his strongly-marked features a likeness to those of my poor friend Silvestre,
his descendant, who had died twenty years ago in my arms, but perhaps that
was fancy. At any rate, there he sat, a sad memento of the fate that so
often overtakes those who would penetrate into the unknown; and there probably
he will still sit, crowned with the dread majesty of death, for centuries
yet unborn, to startle the eyes of wanderers like ourselves, if any such
should ever come again to invade his loneliness. The thing overpowered
us, already nearly done to death as we were with cold and hunger.

<P>&nbsp;"Let us go," said Sir Henry, in a low voice; "stay, we will give
him a companion," and, lifting up the dead body of the Hottentot Ventv&ouml;gel,
he placed it near that of the old don. Then he stooped down and with a
jerk broke the rotten string of the crucifix round his neck, for his fingers
were too cold to attempt to unfasten it. I believe that he still has it.
I took the pen, and it is before me as I write - sometimes I sign my name
with it.

<P>&nbsp;Then, leaving those two, the proud white man of a past age and
the poor Hottentot, to keep their eternal vigil in the midst of the eternal
snows, we crept out of the cave into the welcome sunshine and resumed our
path, wondering in our hearts how many hours it would be before we were
even as they are.

<P>&nbsp;When we had gone about half a mile we came to the edge of the
plateau, for the nipple of the mountain did not rise out of its exact centre,
though from the desert side it seemed to do so. What lay below us we could
not see, for the landscape was wreathed in billows of morning mist. Presently,
however, the higher layers of mist cleared a little, and revealed, some
five hundred yards beneath us, at the end of a long slope of snow, a patch
of green grass, through which a stream was running. Nor was this all. By
the stream, basking in the morning sun, stood and lay a group of from ten
to fifteen <I>large antelopes</I> at that distance we could not see what
they were.

<P>&nbsp;The sight filled us with an unreasoning joy. There was food in
plenty if only we could get it. But the question was how to get it. The
beasts were fully six hundred yards off, a very long shot, and one not
to be depended on when one's life hung on the results.

<P>&nbsp;Rapidly we discussed the advisability of trying to stalk the game,
but finally reluctantly dismissed it. To begin with, the wind was not favorable,
and further, we should be certain to be perceived, however careful we were,
against the blinding background of snow which we should be obliged to traverse.

<P>&nbsp;"Well, we must have a try from where we are," said Sir Henry.
"Which shall it be, Quatermain, the repeating rifles or the expresses?"

<P>&nbsp;Here again was a question. The Winchester repeaters - -of which
we had two, Umbopa carrying poor Ventv&ouml;gel's as well as his own -
were sighted up to a thousand yards, whereas the expresses were only sighted
to three hundred and fifty, beyond which distance shooting with them was
more or less guess-work. On the other hand, if they did hit, the express
bullets, being expanding, were much more likely to bring the game down.
It was a knotty point, but I made up my mind that we must risk it and use
the expresses.

<P>&nbsp;"Let each of us take the buck opposite to him. Aim well at the
point of the shoulder, and high up," said I; "and Umbopa, do you give the
word, so that we may all fire together."

<P>&nbsp;Then came a pause, each man aiming his level best, as indeed one
is likely to do when one knows that life itself depends upon the shot.

<P>&nbsp;"Fire!" said Umbopa, in Zulu, and at almost the same instant the
three rifles rang out loudly; three clouds of smoke hung for a moment before
us, and a hundred echoes went flying away over the silent snow. Presently
the smoke cleared, and revealed - oh, joy - a great buck lying on its back
and kicking furiously in its death agony. We gave a yell of triumph; we
were saved, we should not starve. Weak as we were, we rushed down the intervening
slope of snow, and in ten minutes from the time of firing the animal's
heart and liver were lying smoking before us. But now a new difficulty
arose; we had no fuel, and therefore could make no fire to cook them at.
We gazed at each other in dismay.

<P>&nbsp;"Starving men must not be fanciful," said Good; "we must eat raw
meat."

<P>&nbsp;There was no other way out of the dilemma, and our gnawing hunger
made the proposition less distasteful than it would otherwise have been.
So we took the heart and liver and buried them for a few minutes in a patch
of snow to cool them off. Then we washed them in the ice-cold water of
the stream, and lastly ate them greedily. It sounds horrible enough, but,
honestly, I never tasted anything so good as that raw meat. In a quarter
of an hour we were changed men. Our life and our vigor came back to us,
our feeble pulses grew strong again, and the blood went coursing through
our veins. But, mindful of the results of over-feeding on starving stomachs,
we were careful not to eat too much, stopping while we were still hungry.

<P>&nbsp;"Thank God!" said Sir Henry; "that brute has saved our lives.
What is it, Quatermain ?"

<P>&nbsp;I rose and went to look at the antelope, for I was not certain.
It was about the size of a donkey, with large, curved horns. I had never
seen one like it before, the species was new to me. It was brown, with
faint red stripes and a thick coat. I afterwards discovered that the natives
of that wonderful country called the species "Inco." It was very rare,
and only found at a great altitude, where no other game would live. The
animal was fairly shot high up in the shoulder, though whose bullet it
was that brought it down we could not, of course, discover. I believe that
Good, mindful of his marvellous shot at the giraffe, secretly set it down
to his own prowess, and we did not contradict him.

<P>&nbsp;We had been so busy satisfying our starving stomachs that we had
hitherto not found time to look about us. But now, having set Umbopa to
cut off as much of the best meat as we were likely to be able to carry,
we began to inspect our surroundings. The mist had now cleared away, for
it was eight o'clock, and the sun had sucked it up, so we were able to
take in all the country before us at a glance. I know not how to describe
the glorious panorama which unfolded itself to our enraptured gaze. I have
never seen anything like it before, nor shall, I suppose, again.

<P>&nbsp;Behind and over us towered Sheba's snowy breasts, and below some
five thousand feet beneath where we stood, lay league on league of the
most lovely champaign country. Here were dense patches of lofty forest,
there a great river wound its silvery way. To the left stretched a vast
expanse of rich, undulating veldt or grass land, on which we could just
make out countless herds of game or cattle, at that distance we could not
tell which. This expanse appeared to be ringed in by a wall of distant
mountains. To the right the country was more or less mountainous, that
is, solitary hills stood up from its level, with stretches of cultivated
lands between, among which we could distinctly see groups of dome-shaped
huts. The landscape lay before us like a map, in which rivers flashed like
silver snakes, and Alpine peaks crowned with wildly twisted snow-wreaths
rose in solemn grandeur, while over all was the glad sunlight and the wide
breath of Nature's happy life.

<P>&nbsp;Two curious things struck us as we gazed. First, that the country
before us must lie at least five thousand feet higher than the desert we
had crossed, and, secondly, that all the rivers flowed from south to north.
As we had painful reason to know, there was no water at all on the southern
side of the vast range on which we stood, but on the northern side were
many streams, most of which appeared to. unite with the great river we
could trace winding away farther than we could follow it.

<P>&nbsp;We sat down for a while and gazed in silence at this wonderful
view. Presently Sir Henry spoke.

<P>&nbsp;"Isn't there something on the map about Solomon's Great Road?"
he said.

<P>&nbsp;I nodded, my eyes still looking out over the far country.

<P>&nbsp;"Well, look; there it is!" and he pointed a little to our fight.

<P>&nbsp;Good and I looked accordingly, and there, winding away towards
the plain, was what appeared to be a wide turnpike road. We had not seen
it at first because it, on reaching the plain, turned behind some broken
country. We did not say anything, at least not much; we were beginning
to lose the sense of wonder. Somehow it did not seem particularly unnatural
that we should find a sort of Roman road in this strange land. We accepted
the fact, that was all.

<P>&nbsp;"Well," said Good, "it must be quite near us if we cut off to
the right. Hadn't we better be making a start?"

<P>&nbsp;This was sound advice, and so soon us we had washed our faces
and hands in the stream we acted on it. For a mile or so we made our way
over boulders and across patches of snow, till suddenly, on reaching the
top of the little rise, there lay the road at our feet. It was a splendid
road cut out of the solid rock, at least fifty feet wide, and apparently
well kept; but the odd thing about it was that it seemed to begin there.
We walked down and stood on it, but one single hundred paces behind us,
in the direction of Sheba's breasts, it vanished - the whole surface of
the mountain being strewed with boulders interspersed with patches of snow.

<P>&nbsp;"What do you make of that, Quatermain?" asked Sir Henry.

<P>&nbsp;I shook my head, I could make nothing of it.

<P>&nbsp;"I have it!" said Good; "the road no doubt ran right over the
range and across the desert the other side, but the sand of the desert
has covered it up, and above us it has been obliterated by some volcanic
eruption of molten lava."

<P>&nbsp;This seemed a good suggestion; at any rate, we accepted it, and
proceeded down the mountain. It was a very different business travelling
along down hill on that magnificent pathway with full stomachs, to what
it had been travelling up hill over the snow quite starved and almost frozen.
Indeed, had it not been for melancholy recollections of poor Ventv&ouml;gel's
sad fate, and of that grim cave where he kept company with the old don,
we should have been positively cheerful, notwithstanding the sense of unknown
dangers before us. Every mile we walked the atmosphere grew softer and
balmier, and the country before us shone with a yet more luminous beauty.
As for the road itself, I never saw such an engineering work, though Sir
Henry said that the great road over the St. Gothard in Switzerland was
very like it.

<P>&nbsp;No difficulty had been too great for the Old World engineer who
designed it. At one place we came to a great ravine three hundred feet
broad and at least a hundred deep. This vast gulf was actually filled in,
apparently with huge blocks of dressed stone, with arches pierced at the
bottom for a water-way, over which the road went sublimely on. At another
place it was cut in zigzags out of the side of a precipice five hundred
feet deep, and in a third it tunnelled right through the base of an intervening
ridge a space of thirty yards or more.

<P>&nbsp;Here we noticed that the sides of the tunnel were covered with
quaint sculptures, mostly of mailed figures driving in chariots. One, which
was exceedingly beautiful, represented a whole battle scene with a convoy
of captives being marched off in the distance.

<P>&nbsp;"Well," said Sir Henry, after inspecting this ancient work of
art, "it is very well to call this Solomon's Road, but my humble opinion
is that the Egyptians have been here before Solomon's people ever set a
foot on it. If that isn't Egyptian handiwork, all I have to say is it is
very like it."

<P>&nbsp;By midday we had advanced sufficiently far down the mountain to
reach the region where wood was to be met with. First we came to scattered
bushes which grew more and more frequent, till at last we found the road
winding through a vast grove of silver-trees similar to those which are
to be seen on the slopes of Table Mountain at Cape Town. I had never before
met with them in all my wanderings, except at the Cape, and their appearance
here astonished me greatly.

<P>&nbsp;"Ah!" said Good, surveying these shining-leaved trees with evident
enthusiasm, "here is lots of wood, let us stop and cook some dinner; I
have about digested that raw meat."

<P>&nbsp;Nobody objected to this, so, leaving the road, we made our way
to a stream which was babbling away not far off, and soon had a goodly
fire of dry boughs blazing. Cutting off some substantial hunks from the
flesh of the inco which we had brought with us, we proceeded to toast them
on the ends of sharp sticks, as one sees the Kaffirs do, and ate them with
relish. After filling ourselves, we lit our pipes and gave ourselves up
to enjoyment, which, compared to the hardships we had recently undergone,
seemed almost heavenly.

<P>&nbsp;The brook, of which the banks were clothed with dense masses of
a gigantic species of maidenhair fern interspersed with feathery tufts
of wild asparagus, babbled away merrily at our side, the soft air murmured
through the leaves of the silver-trees, doves cooed around, and bright-winged
birds flashed like living gems from bough to bough. It was like Paradise.

<P>&nbsp;The magic of the place, combined with the overwhelming sense of
dangers left behind and of the promised land reached at last, seemed to
charm us into silence. Sir Henry and Umbopa sat conversing in, a mixture
of broken English and Kitchen Zulu in a low voice, but earnestly enough,
and I lay, with my eyes half shut, upon that fragrant bed of fern and watched-them.
Presently I missed Good, and looked to see what had become of him. As I
did so I observed him sitting by the bank of the stream, in which he had
been bathing. He had nothing on but his flannel shirt, and, his natural
habits of extreme neatness having reasserted themselves, was actively employed
in making a most elaborate toilet. He had washed his gutta-percha collar,
thoroughly shaken out his trousers, coat, and waistcoat, and was now folding
them up neatly till he was ready to put them on, shaking his head sadly
as he did so over the numerous rents and tears in them which had naturally
resulted from our frightful journey. Then he took his boots, scrubbed them
with a handful of fern, and finally rubbed them over with a piece of fat
which he had carefully saved from the inco meat, till they looked, comparatively
speaking, respectable. Having inspected them judiciously through his eye-glass,
he put them on and began a fresh operation. From a little bag he carried
he produced a pocket-comb in which was fixed a tiny looking-glass and in
this surveyed himself. Apparently he was not satisfied, for he proceeded
to do his hair with great care. Then came a pause while he again contemplated
the effect; still it was not satisfactory. He felt his chin, on which was
now the accumulated scrub of a ten days' beard. "Surely," thought I; "he
is not going to try and shave." But so it was. Taking the piece of fat
with which he had greased his boots, he washed it carefully in the stream.
Then diving again into the hag, he brought out a little pocket razor with
a guard to it, such as are sold to people afraid of cutting themselves,
or to those about to undertake a sea voyage. Then he vigorously scrubbed
his face and chin with the fat and began. But it was evidently a painful
process, for he groaned very much over it, and I was convulsed with inward
laughter as I watched him struggling with that stubbly beard. It seemed
so very odd that a man should take the trouble to shave himself with a
piece of fat in such a place and under such circumstances. At last he succeeded
in getting the worst of the scrub off the right side of his face and chin,
when suddenly I, who was watching, became aware of a flash of light that
passed just by his head.

<P>&nbsp;Good sprang up with a profane exclamation (if it had not been
a safety razor he would certainly have cut his throat), and so did I, without
the exclamation, and this was what I saw. Standing there, not more than
twenty paces from where I was, and ten from Good, was a group of men. They
were very tall and copper-colored, and some of them wore great plumes of
black feathers and short cloaks of leopard skins; this-was all I noticed
at the moment. In front of them stood a youth of about seventeen, his hand
still raised and his body bent forward in the attitude of a Grecian statue
of a spear thrower. Evidently the flash of light had been a weapon, and
he had thrown it.

<P>&nbsp;As I looked an old, soldier-like looking man stepped forward out
of the group, and catching the youth by the arm said something to him.
Then they advanced upon us.

<P>&nbsp;Sir Henry, Good, and Umbopa had by this time seized their rifles
and lifted them threateningly. The party of natives still came on. It struck
me that they could not know what rifles were, or they would not have treated
them with such contempt.

<P>&nbsp;"Put down your guns!" I hallooed to the others, seeing that our
only chance of safety in conciliation. They obeyed, and, walking to the
front, I addressed the elderly man who had checked the youth.

<P>&nbsp;"Greeting," I said, in Zulu, not knowing what language to use.
To my surprise I was understood.

<P>&nbsp;"Greeting," answered the man, not, indeed, in the same tongue,
but in a dialect so closely allied to it that neither Umbopa nor myself
had any difficulty in understanding it. Indeed, as we afterwards found
out, the language spoken by this people was an old-fashioned form of the
Zulu tongue, bearing about the same relationship to it that the English
of Chaucer does to the English of the nineteenth century.

<P>&nbsp;"Whence come ye?" he went on, "what are ye? and why are the faces
of three of ye white, and the face of the fourth as the face of our mother's
sons?" and he pointed to Umbopa. I looked at Umbopa as he said it, and
it flashed across me that he was right. Umbopa was like the faces of the
men before me; so was his great form. But I had not time to reflect on
this coincidence.

<P>&nbsp;"We are strangers, and come in peace," I answered, speaking very
slow, so that he might understand me, "and this man is our servant."

<P>&nbsp;"Ye lie," he answered, "no strangers can cross the mountains where
all things die. But what do your lies matter; if ye are strangers then
ye must die, for no strangers may live in the land of the Kukuanas. It
is the king's law. Prepare then to die, O strangers!"

<P>&nbsp;I was slightly staggered at this, more especially as I saw the
hands of some of the party of men steal down to their sides, where hung
on each what looked to me like a large and heavy knife.

<P>&nbsp;"What does that beggar say?" asked Good.

<P>&nbsp;"He says we are going to be scragged," I answered, grimly.

<P>&nbsp;"Oh, Lord," groaned Good; and, as was his way when perplexed,
put his hand to his false teeth, dragging the top set down and allowing
them to fly back to his jaw with a snap. It was a most fortunate move,
for next second the dignified crowd of Kukuanas gave a simultaneous yell
of horror, and bolted back some yards.

<P>&nbsp;"What's up?" said I.

<P>&nbsp;"It's his teeth," whispered Sir Henry, excitedly. "He moved them.
Take them out, Good, take them out!"

<P>&nbsp;He obeyed, slipping the set into the sleeve of his flannel shirt.

<P>&nbsp;In another second curiosity had overcome fear, and the men advanced
slowly. Apparently they had now forgotten their amiable intentions of doing
for us.

<P>&nbsp;"How is it, O strangers," asked the old man, solemnly, "that the
teeth of the man" (pointing to Good, who had nothing on but a flannel shirt,
and had only half finished his shaving) "whose body is clothed, and whose
legs are bare, who grows hair on one side of his sickly face and not on
the other, and who has one shining and transparent eye, move of themselves,
coming away from the jaws and returning of their own will?"

<P>&nbsp;"Open your mouth," I said to Good, who promptly curled up his
lips and grinned at the old gentleman like an angry dog, revealing to their
astonished gaze two thin red lines of gum as utterly innocent of ivories
as a new-born elephant. His audience gasped.

<P>&nbsp;"Where are his teeth?" they shouted; "with our eyes we saw them."

<P>&nbsp;Turning his head slowly and with a gesture of ineffable contempt,
Good swept his hand across his mouth. Then he grinned again, and lo! there
were two rows of lovely teeth.

<P>&nbsp;The young man who had flung the knife threw himself down on the
grass and gave vent to a prolonged howl of terror; and as for the old gentleman,
his knees knocked together with fear.

<P>&nbsp;"I see that ye are spirits," he said, falteringly; "did ever man
born of woman have hair on one side of his face and not on the other, or
a round and transparent eye, or teeth which moved and melted away and grew
again? Pardon us, O my lords."

<P>&nbsp;Here was luck indeed, and, needless to say, I jumped at the chance.

<P>&nbsp;"It is granted," I said, with an imperial smile. "Nay, ye shall
know the truth. We come from another world, though we are men such as ye;
we come," I went on, "from the biggest star that shines at night."

<P>&nbsp;"Oh! oh!" groaned the chorus of astonished aborigines.

<P>&nbsp;"Yes," I went on, "we do, indeed;" and I again smiled benignly
as I uttered that amazing lie. "We come to stay with you a little while,
and bless you by our sojourn. Ye will see, O friends, that I have prepared
myself by learning your language."

<P>&nbsp;"It is so, it is so," said the chorus. "Only, my lord," put in
the old gentleman, "thou hast learned it very badly."

<P>&nbsp;I cast an indignant glance at him and he quailed.

<P>&nbsp;"Now, friends," I continued, "ye might think that after so long
a journey we should find it in our hearts to avenge such a reception, mayhap
to strike cold in death the impious hand that - that, in short - threw
a knife at the head of him whose teeth come and go."

<P>&nbsp;"Spare him, my lords," said the old man, in supplication; "he
is the king's son, and I am his uncle. If anything befalls him his blood
will be required at my hands."

<P>&nbsp;"Yes, that is certainly so," put in the young man with great emphasis.

<P>&nbsp;"You may perhaps doubt our power to avenge," I went on, heedless
of this by-play. "Stay, I will show you. Here, you dog and slave" (addressing
Umbopa in a savage tone), "give me the magic tube that speaks;" and I tipped
a wink towards my express rifle.

<P>&nbsp;Umbopa rose to the occasion, and with something as nearly resembling
a grin as I have ever seen on his dignified face, handed me the rifle.

<P>&nbsp;"It is here, O lord of lords," he said, with a deep obeisance.

<P>&nbsp;Now, just before I asked for the rifle I had perceived a little
klipspringer antelope standing on a mass of rock about seventy yards away,
and determined to risk a shot at it.

<P>&nbsp;"Ye see that buck," I said, pointing the animal out to the party
before me. "Tell me, is it possible for man, born of woman, to kill it
from here with a noise?"

<P>&nbsp;"It is not possible, my lord," answered the old man.

<P>&nbsp;"Yet shall I kill it," I said, quietly.

<P>&nbsp;The old man smiled. "That my lord cannot do," he said.

<P>&nbsp;I raised the rifle, and covered the buck. It was a small animal,
and one which one might well be excused for missing, but I knew that it
would not do to miss.

<P>&nbsp;I drew a deep breath, and slowly pressed on the trigger. The buck
stood still as stone.

<P>&nbsp;"Bang! thud!" The buck sprang into the air and fell on the rock
dead as a door-nail.

<P>&nbsp;A groan of terror burst from the group before us.

<P>&nbsp;"If ye want meat," I remarked, coolly, "go fetch that buck."

<P>&nbsp;The old man made a sign and one of his followers departed, and
presently returned bearing the klipspringer. I noticed, with satisfaction,
that I had hit it fairly behind the shoulder. They gathered round the poor
creature's body, gazing at the bullet-hole in consternation.

<P>&nbsp;"Ye see," I said, "I do not speak empty words."

<P>&nbsp;There was no answer.

<P>&nbsp;"If ye yet doubt our power," I went on, "let one of ye go stand
upon that rock, that I may make him as this buck."

<P>&nbsp;None of them seemed at all inclined to take the hint, till at
last the king's son spoke.

<P>&nbsp;"It is well said. Do thou, my uncle, go stand upon the rock. It
is but a buck that the magic has killed. Surely it cannot kill a man."

<P>&nbsp;The old gentleman did not take the suggestion in good part. Indeed,
he seemed hurt.

<P>&nbsp;"No! no!" he ejaculated, hastily; "my old eyes have seen enough.
These are wizards, indeed. Let us bring them to the king. Yet if any should
wish a further proof, let <I>him</I> stand upon the rock, that the magic
tube may speak with him."

<P>&nbsp;There was a most general and hasty expression of dissent.

<P>&nbsp;"Let not good magic be wasted on our poor bodies," said one, "we
are satisfied. All the witchcraft of our people cannot show the like of
this."

<P>&nbsp;"It is so," remarked the old gentleman, in a tone of intense relief;
"without any doubt it is so. Listen, children of the stars, children of
the shining eye and the movable teeth, who roar out in thunder and slay
from afar. I am Infadoos, son of Kafa, once king of the Kukuana people.
This youth is Scragga."

<P>&nbsp;"He nearly scragged me," murmured Good.

<P>&nbsp;"Scragga, son of Twala, the great king - Twala, husband of a thousand
wives, chief and lord paramount of the Kukuanas, keeper of the great road,
terror of his enemies, student of the Black Arts, leader of an hundred
thousand warriors; Twala the One-eyed, the Black, the Terrible."

<P>&nbsp;"So," said I, superciliously, "lead us then to Twala. We do not
talk with low people and underlings."

<P>&nbsp;"It is well, my lords, we will lead you, but the way is long.
We are hunting three days' journey from the place of the king. But let
my lords have patience, and we will lead them?

<P>&nbsp;"It is well," I said, carelessly, "all time is before us, for
we do not die. We are ready; lead on. But Infadoos, and thou, Scragga,
beware! Play us no tricks, make for us no snares, for before your brains
of mud have thought of them we shall know them and avenge them. The light
from the transparent eye of him with the bare legs and the half-haired
face (Good) shall destroy you, and go through your land; his vanishing
teeth shall fix themselves fast in you and eat you up, you and your wives
and children; the magic tubes shall talk with you loudly, and make you
as sieves. Beware!"

<P>&nbsp;This magnificent address did not fail of its effect; indeed, it
was hardly needed, so deeply were our friends already impressed with our
powers.

<P>&nbsp;The old man made a deep obeisance, and murmured the word "Koom,
koom," which I afterwards discovered was their royal salute, corresponding
to the Bayete of the Zulus, and, turning, addressed his followers. These
at once proceeded to lay hold of all our goods and chattels, in order to
bear them for us, excepting only the guns, which they would on no account
touch. They even seized Good's clothes, which were, as the reader may remember,
neatly folded up beside him.

<P>&nbsp;He at once made a dive for them, and a loud altercation ensued.

<P>&nbsp;"Let not my lord of the transparent eye and the melting teeth
touch them," said the old man. "Surely his slaves shall carry the things."

<P>&nbsp;"But I want to put 'em on!" roared Good, in nervous English.

<P>&nbsp;Umbopa translated.

<P>&nbsp;"Nay, my lord." put in Infadoos, "would my lord cover up his beautiful
white legs (although he was so dark Good had a singularly white skin) from
the eyes of his servants? Have we offended my lord that he should do such
a thing?"

<P>&nbsp;Here I nearly exploded with laughing; and meanwhile, one of the
men started on with the garments.

<P>&nbsp;"Damn it!" roared Good, "that black villain has got my trousers."

<P>&nbsp;"Look here, Good," said Sir Henry, "you have appeared in this
country in a certain character, and you must live up to it. It will never
do for you to put on trousers again. Henceforth you must live in a flannel
shirt, a pair of boots, and an eye-glass."

<P>&nbsp;"Yes," I said, "and with whiskers on one side of your face and
not on the other. If you change any of these things they will think that
we are impostors. I am very sorry for you, but, seriously, you must do
it. If once they begin to suspect us, our lives will not be worth a brass
farthing."

<P>&nbsp;"Do you really think so?" said Good, gloomily.

<P>&nbsp;"I do, indeed. Your `beautiful white legs' and your eye-glass
are now <I>the</I> feature of our party, and, as Sir Henry says, you must
live up to them. Be thankful that you have got your boots on, and that
the air is warm."

<P>&nbsp;Good sighed, and said no more, but it took him a fortnight to
get accustomed to his attire.
