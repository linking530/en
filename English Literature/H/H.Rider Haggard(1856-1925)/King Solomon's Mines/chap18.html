CHAPTER XVIII</H2>

<H3>
WE ABANDON HOPE</H3>
I CAN give no adequate description of the horrors of the night which followed.
Mercifully they were to some extent mitigated by sleep, for even in such
a position as ours wearied nature will sometimes assert itself. But I,
at any rate, found it impossible to sleep much. Putting aside the terrifying
thought of our impending doom - for the bravest man on earth might well
quail from such a fate as awaited us, and I never had any great pretensions
to be brave - the <I>silence</I> itself was too great to allow of it. Reader,
you may have lain awake at night and thought the silence oppressive, but
I say with confidence that you can have no idea what a vivid, tangible
thing perfect silence really is. On the surface of the earth there is always
some sound or motion, and though it may in itself be imperceptible, yet
does it deaden the sharp edge of absolute silence. But here there was none.
We were buried in the bowels of a huge, snow-clad peak. Thousands of feet
above us the fresh air rushed over the white snow, but no sound of it reached
us. We were separated by a long tunnel and five feet of rock even from
the awful chamber of the. dead; and the dead make no noise. The crashing
of all the artillery of earth and heaven could not have come to our ears
in our living tomb. We were cut off from all echoes of the world - we were
as already dead.

<P>&nbsp;And then the irony of the-situation forced itself upon me. There
around us lay treasures enough to pay off a moderate national debt, or
to build a fleet of iron-clads, and yet we would gladly have bartered them
all for the faintest chance of escape. Soon, doubtless, we should be glad
to exchange them for a bit of food or a cup of water, and, after that,
even for the speedy close to our sufferings. Truly wealth, which men spend
all their lives in acquiring, is a valueless thing at the last.

<P>&nbsp;And so the night wore on.

<P>&nbsp;"Good," said Sir Henry's voice at last, and it sounded awful in
the intense stillness, "how many matches have you in the box?"

<P>&nbsp;"Eight, Curtis"

<P>&nbsp;"Strike one, and let us see the time." He did so, and in contrast
to the dense darkness the flame nearly blinded us. It was five o'clock
by my watch. The beautiful dawn was now blushing on the snow-wreaths far
over our heads, and the breeze would be stirring the night mists in the
hollows.

<P>&nbsp;"We had better eat something and keep up our strength," said I.

<P>&nbsp;"What is the good of eating?" answered Good; "the sooner we die
and get it over the better."

<P>&nbsp;"While there is life there is hope," said Sir Henry.

<P>&nbsp;Accordingly we ate and sipped some water, and another period of
time passed, when somebody suggested that it might be as well to get as
near to the door as possible and hallo, on the faint chance of somebody
catching a sound outside. Accordingly Good, who, from long practice at
sea, has a fine, piercing note, groped his way down the passage and began,
and I must say he made a most diabolical noise. I never heard such yells;
but it might have been a mosquito buzzing for all axe effect it produced.

<P>&nbsp;After a while he gave it up, and came back very thirsty, and had
to have some water. After that we gave up yelling, as it encroached on
the supply of water.

<P>&nbsp;So we all sat down once more against our chests of useless diamonds
in that dreadful inaction which was one of the hardest circumstances of
our fate; and I am bound to say that, for my part, I gave way in despair.
Laying my head against Sir Henry's broad shoulder, I burst into tears;
and I think I heard Good gulping away on the other side, and swearing hoarsely
at himself for doing so.

<P>&nbsp;Ah, how good and brave that great man was! Had we been two frightened
children, and he our nurse, he could not have treated us more tenderly.
Forgetting his own share of miseries, he did all he could to soothe our
broken nerves, telling stories of men who had been in somewhat similar
circumstances and miraculously escaped; and when these failed to cheer
us, pointing out how, after all, it was only anticipating an end that must
come to us all, that it would soon be over, and that death from exhaustion
was a merciful one (which is not true). Then, in a diffident sort of a
way, as I had once before heard him do, he suggested that we should throw
ourselves on the mercy of a higher Power, which, for my part, I did with
great vigor.

<P>&nbsp;His is a beautiful character, very quiet, but very strong.

<P>&nbsp;And so somehow the day went as the night had gone (if, indeed,
one can use the terms where all was densest night), and when I lit a match
to see the time it was seven o'clock.

<P>&nbsp;Once more we ate and drank, and as we did so an idea occurred
to me.

<P>&nbsp;"How is it," said I, "that the air in this place keeps fresh?
It is thick and heavy, but it is perfectly fresh."

<P>&nbsp;"Great heavens!" said Good, starting up, "I never thought of that.
It can't come through the stone door, for it is air-tight, if ever a door
was. It must come from somewhere. If there were no current of air in the
place we should have been stifled when we first came in. Let us have a
look."

<P>&nbsp;It was wonderful what a change this mere spark of hope wrought
in us. In a moment we were. all three groping about the place on our hands
and knees, feeling for the slightest indication of a draught. Presently
my ardor received a check. I put my hand on something cold. It was poor
Foulata's dead face.

<P>&nbsp;For an hour or more we went on feeling about, till at last Sir
Henry and I gave it up in despair, having got considerably hurt by constantly
knocking our heads against tusks, chests, and the sides of the chamber.
But Good still persevered, saying, with an approach to cheerfulness, that
it was better than doing nothing.

<P>&nbsp;"I say, you fellows," he said, presently, in a constrained sort
of voice, "come here."

<P>&nbsp;Needless to say we scrambled over towards him quick enough.

<P>&nbsp;"Quatermain, put your hand here where mine is. Now, do you feel
anything?"

<P>&nbsp;"I <I>think</I> I feel air coming up."

<P>&nbsp;"Now listen." He rose and stamped upon the place, and a flame
of hope shot up in our hearts. <I>It rang hollow</I>.

<P>&nbsp;With trembling hands I lit a match. I had only three left, and
we saw that we were in the angle of the far corner of the chamber, a fact
that accounted for our not having noticed the hollow ring of the place
during our former exhaustive examination. As the match burned we scrutinized
the spot. There was a join in the solid rock floor, and, great heavens!
there, let in level with the rock, was a stone ring. We said no word; we
were too excited, and our hearts beat too wildly with hope to allow us
to speak. Good had a knife, at the back of which was one of those hooks
that are made to extract stones from horses' hoofs. He opened it, and scratched
away at the ring with it. Finally he got it under, and levered away gently
for fear of breaking the hook. The ring began to move. Being of stone,
it had not got set fast in all the centuries it had lain there, as would
have been the case had it been of iron.

<P>&nbsp;Presently it was upright. Then he got his hands into it and tugged
with all his force, but nothing budged.

<P>&nbsp;"Let me try," I said, impatiently, for the situation of the stone,
right in the angle of the corner, was such that it was impossible for two
to pull at once. I got hold and strained away, but with no results.

<P>&nbsp;Then Sir Henry tried and failed. Taking the hook again, Good scratched
all round the crack where we felt the air coming up.

<P>&nbsp;"Now, Curtis," he said, "tackle on, and put your back into it;
you are as strong as two. Stop," and he took off a stout black silk handkerchief,
which, true to his habits of neatness, he still wore, and ran it through
the ring. "Quatermain, get Curtis round the middle and pull for dear life
when I give the word. <I>Now!</I>

<P>&nbsp;Sir Henry put out all his enormous strength, and Good and I did
the same, with such power as nature had given us.

<P>&nbsp;"Heave! heave! it's giving," gasped Sir Henry; and I heard the
muscles of his great back cracking. Suddenly there came a parting sound,
then a rush of air, and we were all on our backs on the floor with a great
flag-stone on the top of us. Sir Henry's strength had done it, and never
did muscular power stand a man in better stead.

<P>&nbsp;"Light a match, Quatermain," he said, as soon as we had picked
ourselves up and got one breath; "carefully now."

<P>&nbsp;I did so, and there before us was, God be praised! the <I>first
step of a stone stair</I>.

<P>&nbsp;"Now what is to be done?" asked Good.

<P>&nbsp;"Follow the stair, of course, and trust to Providence."

<P>&nbsp;

<P>"Stop!" said Sir Henry; "Quatermain, get the bit of biltong and the
water that is left; we may want them."

<P>&nbsp;I went creeping back to our place by the chests for that purpose,
and as I was coming away an idea struck me. We had not thought much of
the diamonds for the last twenty-four hours or so; indeed, the idea of
diamonds was nauseous, seeing what they had entailed upon us; but, thought
I, I may as well pocket a few in case we ever should get out of this ghastly
hole. So I just stuck my fist into the first chest and filled all the available
pockets of my shooting coat, tapping up - this was a happy thought - with
a couple of handfuls of big ones out of the third chest.

<P>&nbsp;"I say, you fellows," I sung out, "won't you take some diamonds
with you? I've filled my pockets."

<P>&nbsp;"Oh! hang the diamonds!" said Sir Henry. "I hope that I may never
see another."

<P>&nbsp;As for Good, he made no answer. He was, I think, taking a last
farewell of all that was left of the poor girl who loved him so well. And,
curious as it may seem to you, my reader, sitting at home at ease and reflecting
on the vast, indeed, the immeasurable, wealth which we were thus abandoning,
I can assure you that if you had passed some twenty-eight hours with next
to nothing to eat and drink in that place, you would not have cared to
cumber yourself with diamonds while plunging down into the unknown bowels
of the earth, in the wild hope of escape from an agonizing death. If it
had not, from the habits of a lifetime, become a sort of second nature
with me never to leave anything worth having behind if there was the slightest
chance of my being able to carry it away, I am sure I should not have bothered
to fill my pockets.

<P>&nbsp;"Come on, Quatermain," said Sir Henry, who was already standing
on the first step of the stone stair. "Steady, I will go first."

<P>&nbsp;"Mind where you put your feet; there may be some awful hole underneath,"
said I.

<P>&nbsp;"Much more likely to be another room," said Sir Henry, as he slowly
descended, counting the steps as he went.

<P>&nbsp;When he got to "fifteen" he stopped. "Here's the bottom," he said.
"Thank goodness! I think it's a passage. Come on down!"

<P>&nbsp;Good descended next, and I followed last, and on reaching the
bottom lit one of the two remaining matches. By its light we could just
see that we were standing in a narrow tunnel, which ran right and left
at right angles to the staircase we had descended. Before we could make
out any more the match burned my fingers and went out. Then arose the delicate
question of which way to turn. Of course it was impossible to know what
the tunnel was or where it ran to, and yet to turn one way might lead us
to safety, and the other to destruction. We were utterly perplexed, till
suddenly it struck Good that when I had lit the match the draught of the
passage blew the flame to the left.

<P>&nbsp;"Let us go against the draught," he said; "air draws inward, not.
outward."

<P>&nbsp;We took this suggestion, and, feeling along the wall with the
hand, while trying the ground before at every step, we departed from that
accursed treasure chamber on our terrible quest. If ever it should be entered
again by living man, which I do not think it will be, he will find a token
of our presence in the open chests of jewels, the empty lamp, and the white
bones of poor Foulata. When we had groped our way for about a quarter of
an hour-along the passage it suddenly took a sharp turn, or else was bisected
by another, which we followed, only in course of time to be led into a
third. And so it went on for some hours. We seemed to be in a stone labyrinth
which led nowhere. What all these passages are, of course I cannot say,
but we thought that they must be the ancient workings of a mine, of which
the various shafts travelled hither and thither as the ore led them. This
is the only way in which we could account for such a multitude of passages.
At length we halted, thoroughly worn out with fatigue, and with that hope
deferred which maketh the heart sick, and ate up our poor remaining piece
of biltong, and drank our last sip of water, for our throats were like
lime kilns. It seemed to us that we had escaped Death in the darkness of
the chamber only to meet him in the darkness of the tunnels. As we stood,
once more utterly depressed, I thought I caught a sound, to which I aired
the attention of the others. It was very faint and very far off, but it
was a sound, a faint, murmuring sound, for the others heard it then, and
no words can describe the blessedness of it after all those hours of utter,
awful stillness.

<P>&nbsp;"By Heaven! it's running water," said Good.

<P>&nbsp;"Come on."

<P>&nbsp;Off we started again in the direction from which the faint murmur
seemed to come, groping our way as before along the rocky walls. As we
went it got more and more audible, till at last it seemed quite loud in
the quiet. On, yet on, now one could distinctly make out the unmistakable
swirl of rushing water. And yet how could there be running water in the
bowels of the earth? Now we were quite near to it, and Good, who was leading,
swore that he could smell it.

<P>&nbsp;"Go gently, Good," said Sir Henry, "we must he close." <I>Splash!</I>
and a cry from Good.

<P>&nbsp;He had fallen in.

<P>&nbsp;"Good! Good! where are you?" we shouted, in terrified distress.
To our intense relief, an answer came back in a choky voice.

<P>&nbsp;"All right; I've got hold of a rock. Strike a light to show me
where you are."

<P>&nbsp;Hastily I lit the last remaining match. Its faint gleam discovered
to us a dark mass of water running at our feet. How wide it was we could
not see, but there, some way out, was the dark form of our companion hanging
on to a projecting rock.

<P>&nbsp;"Stand dear to catch me," sung out Good. "'I must swim for it."

<P>&nbsp;Then we heard a splash and a great struggle. Another minute and
he had grabbed at and caught Sir Henry's outstretched hand, and we had
pulled him up high and dry into the tunnel.

<P>&nbsp;"My word!" he said, between his gasps, "that was touch and go.
If I hadn't caught that rock, and known how to swim, I should have been
done. It runs like a mill-race, and I could feel no bottom."'

<P>&nbsp;It was clear that this would not do; so after Good had rested
a little, and we had drunk our fill from the water of the subterranean
river, which was sweet and fresh, and washed our faces, which really needed
it, as well as we could, we started from the banks of this African Styx,
and began to retrace our steps along the tunnel, Good dripping unpleasantly
in front of us. At length we came to another tunnel leading to our right.

<P>&nbsp;"We may as well take it," said Sir Henry, wearily; "all roads
are alike here; we can only go on till we drop."

<P>&nbsp;Slowly, for a long, long while, we stumbled, utterly weary, along
this new tunnel, Sir Henry leading now.

<P>&nbsp;Suddenly he stopped, and we bumped up against him.

<P>&nbsp;"Look!" he whispered, "is my brain going, or is that light?"

<P>&nbsp;We stared with all our eyes, and there, yes, there, far ahead
of us, was a faint glimmering spot, no larger than a cottage window-pane.
It was so faint that I doubt if any eyes, except those which, like ours,
had for days seen nothing but blackness, could have perceived it at all.

<P>&nbsp;With a sort of gasp of hope we pushed on. In five minutes there
was no longer any doubt: it <I>was</I> a patch of faint light. A minute
more and a breath of real live air was fanning us. On we struggled. All
at once the tunnel narrowed. Sir Henry went on his knees. Smaller yet it
grew, till it was only the size of a large fox's earth - it was <I>earth</I>
now, mind you; the rock had ceased.

<P>&nbsp;A squeeze, a struggle, and Sir Henry was out, and so was Good,
and so was I, and there above us were the blessed stars, and in our nostrils
was the sweet air; then suddenly something gave, and we were all rolling
over and over and over through grass and bushes and soft, wet soil.

<P>&nbsp;I caught at something and stopped. Sitting up, I hallooed lustily.
An answering shout came from just below, where Sir Henry's wild career
had been stopped by some level ground. I scrambled to him, and found him
unhurt, though breathless. Then we looked for Good. A little way off we
found him, too, jammed in a forked root. He was a good deal knocked about,
but soon came to.

<P>&nbsp;We sat down together there on the grass, and the revulsion of
feeling was so great that I really think we cried for joy. We had escaped
from that awful dungeon, that was so near to becoming our grave. Surely
some merciful Power must have guided our footsteps to the jackal-hole at
the termination of the tunnel (for that is what it must have been). And
see, there on the mountains, the dawn we had never thought to look upon
again was blushing rosy red.

<P>&nbsp;Presently the gray light stole down the slopes, and we saw that
we were at the bottom, or, rather, nearly at the bottom, of the vast pit
in front of the entrance to the cave. Now we could make out the dim forms
of the three colossi who sat upon its verge. Doubtless those awful passages,
along which we had wandered the livelong night, had originally been, in
some way, connected with the great diamond mine. As for the subterranean
river in the bowels of the mountain, Heaven only knows what it was, or
whence it flows, or whither it goes. I, for one, have no anxiety to trace
its course.

<P>&nbsp;Lighter it grew, and lighter yet. We could see each other now,
and such a spectacle as we presented I have never set eyes on before or
since. Gaunt-cheeked, hollow-eyed wretches, smeared all over with dust
and mud, bruised, bleeding, the long fear of imminent death yet written
on our countenance, we were, indeed, a sight to frighten the daylight.
And yet it is a solemn fact that Good's eye-glass was still fixed in Good's
eye. I doubt whether he had ever taken it out at all. Neither the darkness,
nor the plunge in the subterranean river, nor the roll down the slope,
had been able to separate Good and his eyeglass.

<P>&nbsp;Presently we rose, fearing that our limbs would stiffen if we
stopped there longer, and commenced with slow and painful steps to struggle
up the sloping sides of the great pit. For an hour or more we toiled steadfastly
up the blue clay, dragging ourselves on by the help of the roots and grasses
with which it was clothed.

<P>&nbsp;At last it was done, and we stood on the great road, on the side
of the pit opposite to the colossi.

<P>&nbsp;By the side of the road, a hundred yards off, a fire was burning
in front of some huts, and round the fire were figures. We made towards
them, supporting one another, and halting every few paces. Presently, one
of the figures rose, saw us, and fell on to the ground; crying out for
fear.

<P>&nbsp;"Infadoos, Infadoos! it is us, thy friends."

<P>&nbsp;We rose; he ran to us, staring wildly, and still shaking with
fear.

<P>&nbsp;"Oh, my lords, my lords, it is indeed you come back from the dead!
- come back from the dead!"

<P>&nbsp;And the old warrior flung himself down before us, and clasped
Sir Henry's knees, and wept aloud for joy.
