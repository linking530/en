<H3>
IGNOSI'S FAREWELL</H3>
TEN days from that eventful morning found us once more in our old quarters
at Loo; and, strange to say, but little the worse for our terrible experience,
except that my stubbly hair came out of that cave about three shades grayer
than it went in, and that Good never was quite the same after Foulata's
death, which seemed to move him very greatly. I am bound to say that, looking
at the thing from the point of view of an oldish man of the world, I consider
her removal was a fortunate occurrence, since, otherwise, complications
would have been sure to ensue. The poor creature was no ordinary native
girl, but a person of great, I had almost said stately, beauty, and of
considerable refinement of mind. But no amount of beauty or refinement
could have made an entanglement between Good and herself a desirable occurrence;
for, as she herself put it, "Can the sun mate with the darkness, or the
white with the black?"

<P>&nbsp;I need hardly state that. we never again penetrated into Solomon's
treasure-chamber. After we had recovered from our fatigues, a process which
took us forty-eight hours, we descended into the great pit in the hope
of finding the hole by which we had crept out of the mountain, but with
no success. To begin with, rain had fallen, and obliterated our spoor;
and what is more, the sides of the vast pit were full of ant-bear and other
holes. It was impossible to say t which of these we owed our salvation.
We also, on the day before we started. back to Loo, made a further examination
of the wonders of the stalactite cave, and, drawn by a kind of restless
feeling, even penetrated once more into the Chamber of the Dead; and, passing
beneath the spear of the white Death gazed, with sensations which it would
be quite impossible for me to describe at the mass of rock which had shut
us! off from escape, thinking, the while, of the priceless treasures beyond,
of the mysterious old hag whose flattened fragments lay crushed beneath
it, and of the fair girl of whose tomb it was the portal. I say gazed at
the "rock," for examine as we would we could find no traces of the join
of the sliding door; nor, indeed, could we hit upon the secret, now utterly
lost, that worked it, though we tried for an hour or more. It was certainly
a marvellous bit of mechanism, characteristic, in its massive and yet inscrutable
simplicity, of the age which produced it; and I doubt if the world has
such another to show.

<P>&nbsp;At last we gave it up in disgust; though, if the mass had suddenly
risen before our eyes, I doubt if we should have screwed up courage to
step over Gagool's mangled remains and once more enter the treasure-chamber,
even in the sure and certain hope of unlimited diamonds. And yet I could
have cried at the idea of leaving all that treasure, the biggest treasure
probably that has ever in the world's history been accumulated in one spot.
But there was no help for it. Only dynamite could force its way through
five feet of solid rock. And so we left it. Perhaps, in some remote unborn
century, a more fortunate explorer may hit upon the "Open Sesame," and
flood the world with gems. But, myself, I doubt it. Somehow, I seem to
feel that the millions of pounds' worth of gems that lie in the three stone
coffers will never shine round the neck of an earthly beauty. They and
Foulata's bones will keep cold company till the end of all things.

<P>&nbsp;With a sigh of disappointment we made our way back, and next day
started for Loo. And yet it was really very ungrateful of us to be disappointed;
for, as the reader will remember, I had, by a lucky thought, taken the
precaution to fill the pockets of my old shooting-coat with gems before
we left our prison-house. A good many of these fell out in the course of
our roll down the side of the pit, including most of the big ones, which
I had crammed in on the top. But, comparatively speaking, an enormous quantity
still remained, including eighteen large stones ranging from about one
hundred to thirty carats in weight. My old shooting-coat still held enough
treasure to make us all, if not millionaires, at least exceedingly wealthy
men, and yet to keep enough stones' each to make the three finest sets
of gems in Europe. So we had not done so badly.

<P>&nbsp;On arriving at Loo we were most cordially received by Ignosi,
whom we found well, and busily engaged in consolidating his power and reorganizing
the regiments which had suffered most in the great struggle with Twala.

<P>&nbsp;He listened with breathless interest to our wonderful story; but
when we told him of old Gagool's frightful end, he grew thoughtful.

<P>&nbsp;"Come hither," he called, to a very old Induna (councillor), who
was sitting with others in a circle round the king, but out of ear-shot.
The old man rose, approached, saluted, and seated himself.

<P>&nbsp;"Thou art old," said Ignosi.

<P>&nbsp;"Ay, my lord the king!"

<P>&nbsp;"Tell me? when thou was little, didst thou know Gagaoola, the
witch doctress?"

<P>&nbsp;"Ay, my lord the king!"

<P>&nbsp;"How was she then - young, like thee?"

<P>&nbsp;"Not so, my lord the king! She was even as now; old and dried,
very ugly, and full of wickedness."

<P>&nbsp;"She is no more; she is dead."

<P>&nbsp;"So, O king! then is a curse taken from the land."

<P>&nbsp;"Go!"

<P>&nbsp;"<I>Koom!</I> I go, black puppy, who tore out the old dog's throat.
<I>Koom!</I>"

<P>&nbsp;"Ye see, my brothers," said Ignosi, "this was a strange woman,
and I rejoice that she is dead. She would have let ye die in the dark place,
and mayhap afterwards she had found a way to slay me, as she found a way
to slay my father and set up Twala, whom her heart loved, in his place.
Now go on with the tale; surely there never was the like?

<P>&nbsp;After I had narrated all the story of our escape, I, as we had
agreed between ourselves that I should, took the opportunity to address
Ignosi as to our departure from Kukuanaland.

<P>&nbsp;"And now, Ignosi, the time has come for us to bid thee farewell,
and start to seek once more our own land. Behold, Ignosi, with us thou
camest a servant, and now we leave thee a mighty king. If thou art grateful
to us, remember to do even as thou didst promise; to rule justly, to respect
the law, and to put none to death without a cause. So shalt thou prosper.
To-morrow, at break of day, Ignosi, wilt thou give us an escort who shall
lead us across the mountains? Is it not so, O king?"

<P>&nbsp;Ignosi covered his face with his hands for a while before answering.

<P>&nbsp;"My heart is sore," he said at last; "your words split my heart
in twain. What have I done to ye, Incubu, Macumazahn, and Bougwan, that
ye should leave me desolate? Ye who stood by me in rebellion and battle,
will ye leave me in the day of peace and victory? What will ye: wives?
Choose from out the land! A place to live in? Behold, the land is yours
as far as ye can see. The white man's houses? Ye shall teach my people
how to build them. Cattle for beef and milk? Every married man shall bring
ye an ox or a cow. Wild game to hunt? Does not the elephant walk through
my forests, and the river-horse sleep in the reeds? Would ye make war?
My Impis (regiments) wait your word. If there is anything more that I can
give, that will I give ye."

<P>&nbsp;"Nay, Ignosi, we want not these things," I answered; "we would
seek our own place."

<P>&nbsp;"Now do I perceive," said Ignosi, bitterly, and with flashing
eyes, "that it is the bright stones that ye love more than me, your friend.
Ye have the stones; now would ye go to Natal and across the black water
and sell them, and be rich, as it is the desire of a white man's heart
to be. Cursed for your sake be the stones, and cursed he who seeks them.
Death shall it be to him who sets foot in the Place of Death to seek them.
I have spoken, white men; ye can go."

<P>&nbsp;I laid my hand upon his arm. "Ignosi," I said, "tell us, when
thou didst wander in Zululand, and among the white men in Natal, did not
thine heart turn to the land thy mother told thee of, thy native land,
where thou didst see the light, and play when thou wast little, the land
where thy place was?"

<P>&nbsp;"It was even so, Macumazahn."

<P>&nbsp;"Then thus does our heart turn to our land and to our own place."

<P>&nbsp;Then came a pause. When Ignosi broke it, it was in a different
voice.

<P>&nbsp;"I do perceive that thy words are, now as ever, wise and full
of reason, Macumazahn; that which flies in the air loves not to run along
the ground; the white man loves not to live on the level of the black.
Well, ye must go, and leave my heart sore, because ye will be as dead to
me, since from where ye will be no tidings can come to me.

<P>&nbsp;"But listen, and let all the white men know my words. No other
white man shall cross the mountains, even if any may live to come so far.
I will see no traders with their guns and rum. My people shall fight with
the spear and drink water, like their forefathers before them. I will have
no praying-men to put fear of death into men's hearts, to stir them up
against the king, and make a path for the white men who follow to run on.
If a white man comes to my gates I will send him back; if a hundred come,
I will push them back; if an army comes, I will make war on them with all
my strength, and they shall not prevail against me. None shall ever come
for the shining stones; no, not an army, for if they come I will send a
regiment and fill up the pit, and break down the white columns in the caves
and fill them with rocks, so that none can come even to that door of which
ye speak, and whereof the way to move it is lost. But for ye three, Incubu,
Macumazahn, and Bougwan, the path is always open; for behold, ye are dearer
to me than aught that breathes.

<P>&nbsp;"And ye would go. Infadoos, my uncle, and my Induna, shall take
thee by the hand and guide thee, with a regiment. There is, as I have learned,
another way across the mountains that he shall show ye. Farewell, my brothers,
brave white men. See me no more, for I have no heart to bear it. Behold,
I make a decree, and it shall be published from the mountains to the mountains,
your names, Incubu, Macumazahn, and Bougwan, shall be as the names of dead
kings, and he who speaks them shall die. So shall your memory be preserved
in the land forever.

<P>&nbsp;"Go, now, ere my eyes rain tears like a woman's. At times when
ye look back down the path of life, or when ye are old and gather yourselves
together to crouch before the fire, because the sun has no more heat, ye
will think of how we stood shoulder to shoulder in that great battle that
thy wise words planned, Macumazahn; of how thou wast the point of that
horn that galled Twala's flank, Bougwan; whilst thou stoodst in the ring
of the Grays, Incubu, and men went down before thine axe like corn before
a sickle; ay, and of how thou didst break the wild bull's (Twala's) strength,
and bring his pride to dust. Fare ye well forever, Incubu, Macumazahn,
and Bougwan, my lords and my friends."

<P>&nbsp;He rose, looked earnestly at us for a few seconds, and then threw
the corner of his kaross over his head, so as to cover his face from us.
We went in silence.

<P>&nbsp;Next day at dawn we left Loo, escorted by our old friend Infadoos
who was heart-broken at our departure, and the regiment of Buffaloes. Early
as the hour was, all the main street of the town was lined with multitudes
of people, who gave us the royal salute as we passed at the head of the
regiment, while the women blessed us as having rid the land of Twala, throwing
flowers before us as we went. It really was very affecting, and not the
sort of thing one is accustomed to meet with from natives.

<P>&nbsp;One very ludicrous incident occurred, however, which I rather
welcomed, as it gave us something to laugh at.

<P>&nbsp;Just before we got to the confines of the town a pretty young
girl, with some beautiful lilies in her hand, came running forward and
presented them to Good (somehow they all seemed to like Good; I think his
eye-glass and solitary whisker gave him a fictitious value), and then said
she had a boon to ask.

<P>&nbsp;"Speak on."

<P>&nbsp;"Let my lord show his servant his beautiful white legs, that his
servant may look on them, and remember them all her days, and tell of them
to her children; his servant has travelled four days' journey to see them,
for the fame of them has gone throughout the land."

<P>&nbsp;"I'll be hanged if I do!" said Good, excitedly.

<P>&nbsp;"Come, come, my dear fellow," said Sir Henry, "you can't refuse
to oblige a lady."

<P>&nbsp;"I won't," said Good, obstinately; "it is positively indecent."

<P>&nbsp;However, in the end he consented to draw up his trousers to the
knee, amidst notes of rapturous admiration from all the women present,
especially the gratified young lady, and in this guise he had to walk till
we got clear of the town.

<P>&nbsp;

<P>Good's legs will, I fear, never be so greatly admired again. Of his
melting teeth, and even of his "transparent eye," they wearied more or
less, but of his legs, never.

<P>&nbsp;As we travelled, Infadoos told us that there was another pass
over the mountains to the north of the one followed by Solomon's Great
Road, or rather that there was a place where it was possible to climb down
the wall of cliff that separated Kukuanaland from the desert, and was broken
by the towering shapes of Sheba's breasts. It appeared, too, that rather
more than two years previously a party of Kukuana hunters had descended
this path into the desert in search of ostriches, whose plumes were much
prized among them for war headdresses, and that in the course of their
hunt they had been led far from the mountains, and were much troubled by
thirst. Seeing, however, trees on the horizon, they made towards them,
and discovered a large and fertile oasis of some miles in extent, and plentifully
watered. It was by way of this oasis that he suggested that we should return,
and the idea seemed to us a good one, as it appeared that we should escape
the rigors of the mountain pass, and as some of the hunters were in attendance
to guide us to the oasis, from which they stated, they could perceive more
fertile spots far away in the desert.

<P>&nbsp;Travelling easily, on the night of the fourth day's journey we
found ourselves: once more on the crest of the mountain! that separate
Kukuanaland from the desert, which rolled away in sandy billows at our
feet, and about twenty-five miles to the north of Sheba's breasts.

<P>&nbsp;At dawn on the following day we were led to the commencement of
a precipitous descent, by which we were to descend the precipice, and gain
the desert two thousand and more feet below.

<P>&nbsp;Here we bade farewell to that true friend and sturdy old warrior,
Infadoos, who solemnly wished all good upon us, and nearly wept with grief.
"Never, my lords," he said, "shall mine old eyes see the like of ye again.
Ah! the way that Incubu cut his men down in the battle! Ah! for the sight
of that stroke with which he swept off my brother Twala's head! It was
beautiful - beautiful! I may never hope to see such another, except perchance
in happy dreams."

<P>&nbsp;We were very sorry to part from him; indeed, Good was so moved
that he gave him as a souvenir - what do you think? - <I>an eye-glass</I>.
(Afterwards we discovered that it was a spare one.) Infadoos was delighted,
foreseeing that the possession of such an article would enormously increase
his prestige, and after several vain attempts actually succeeded in screwing
it into his own eye. Anything more incongruous than the old Warrior looked
with an eye-glass I never saw. Eye-glasses don't go well with leopard-skin
cloaks and black ostrich plumes.

<P>&nbsp;Then, having seen that our guides were well laden with water and
provisions, and having received a thundering farewell salute from the Buffaloes,
we wrung the old warrior's hand, and began our downward climb. A very arduous
business it proved to be, but somehow that evening we found ourselves at
the bottom without accident.

<P>&nbsp;"Do you know," said Sir Henry that night, as we sat by our fire
and gazed up at the beetling cliffs above us, "I think that there are worse
places than Kukuanaland in the world, and that I have spent unhappier times
than the last month or two, though I have never spent such queer ones.
Eh ! you fellows?"

<P>&nbsp;"I almost wish I were back," said Good, with a sigh.

<P>&nbsp;As for myself, I reflected that all's well that ends well; but
in the course of a long life of shaves I never had such shaves as those
I had recently experienced. The thought of that battle still makes me feel
cold all over, and as for our experience in the treasure chamber - !

<P>&nbsp;Next morning we started on a toilsome march across the desert,
having with us a good supply of water carried by our five guides, and camped
that night in the open, starting again at dawn on the morrow.

<P>&nbsp;By midday of the third day's journey we could see the trees of
the oasis of which the guides spoke, and by an hour before sundown we were
once more walking upon grass and listening to the sound of running water.
