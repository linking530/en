CHAPTER IX</H2>

<H3>
TWALA, THE KING</H3>
IT will not be necessary for me to detail at length the incidents of our
journey to Loo. It took two good days' travelling. along Solomon's Great
Road, which pursued its even course right into the heart of Kukuanaland.
Suffice it to say that as we went the country seemed to grow richer and
richer, and the kraals, with their wide surrounding belts of cultivation,
more and more numerous. They were all built upon the same principles as
the first one we had reached, and were guarded by ample garrisons of troops.
Indeed, in Kukuanaland, as among the Germans, the Zulus, and the Masai,
every able-bodied man is a soldier, so that the whole force of the nation
is available for its wars, offensive or defensive. As we travelled along
we were overtaken by thousands of warriors hurrying up to Loo to be present
at the great annual review and festival, and a grander series of troops
I never saw. At sunset on the second day we stopped to rest awhile upon
the summit of some heights over which the road ran, and there, on a beautiful
and fertile plain before us, was Loo itself. For a native town it was an
enormous place, quite five miles round, I should say, with outlying kraals
jutting out from it, which served on grand occasions as cantonments for
the regiments, and a curious horseshoe-shaped hill, with which we were
destined to become better acquainted, about two miles to the north. It
was beautifully situated, and through the centre of the kraal, dividing
it into two portions, ran a river, which appeared to be bridged at several
places, the same, perhaps, that we had seen from the slopes of Sheba's
breasts. Sixty or seventy miles away three great snowcapped mountains,
placed like the points of a triangle, started up out of the level plain.
The conformation of these mountains was unlike that of Sheba's breasts,
being sheer and precipitous, instead of smooth and rounded.

<P>&nbsp;Infadoos saw us looking at them and volunteered a remark:

<P>&nbsp;"The road ends there," he said, pointing to the mountains, known
among the Kukuanas as the "Three Witches."

<P>&nbsp;"Why does it end?" I asked.

<P>&nbsp;"Who knows?" he answered, with a shrug; "the mountains are full
of caves, and there is a great pit between them. It is there that the wise
men of old time used to go to get whatever it was they came to this country
for, and it is there now that our kings are buried in the Place of Death."

<P>&nbsp;"What was it they came for?" I asked, eagerly.

<P>&nbsp;"Nay, I know not. My lords who come from the stars should know,"
he answered, with a quick look. Evidently he knew more than he chose to
say.

<P>&nbsp;"Yes," I went on, "you are right; in the stars we know many things.
I have heard, for instance, that the wise men of old came to those mountains
to get bright stones, pretty playthings, and yellow iron."

<P>&nbsp;"My lord is wise," he answered, coldly; "I am but a child and
cannot talk with my lord on such things. My lord must speak with Gagool
the old, at the king's place, who is wise even as my lord," and he turned
away.

<P>&nbsp;As soon as he was gone I turned to the others and pointed out
the mountains. "There are Solomon's diamond mines," I said.

<P>&nbsp;Umbopa was standing with them, apparently plunged in one of the
fits of abstraction which were common to him, and caught my words.

<P>&nbsp;"Yes, Macumazahn," he put in, in Zulu, "the diamonds are surely
there, and you shall have them, since you white men are so fond of toys
and money."

<P>&nbsp;"How dost thou know that, Umbopa?" I asked, sharply, for I did
not like his mysterious ways.

<P>&nbsp;He laughed; "I dreamed it in the night, white men," and then he,
too, turned upon his heel and went.

<P>&nbsp;"Now what," said Sir Henry, "is our black friend at? He knows
more than he chooses to say, that is clear. By the way, Quatermain, has
he heard anything of - of my brother?"

<P>&nbsp;"Nothing; he has asked every one he has got friendly with, but
they all declare no white man has ever been seen in the country before."

<P>&nbsp;"Do you suppose he ever got. here at all?" suggested Good; "we
have only reached the place by a miracle; is it likely he could have reached
it at all without the map?"

<P>&nbsp;"I don't know," said Sir Henry, gloomily, "but somehow I think
that I shall find him."

<P>&nbsp;Slowly the sun sank, and then suddenly darkness rushed down on
the land like a tangible thing. There was no breathing-place between the
day and the night, no soft transformation scene, for in these latitudes
twilight does not exist. The change from day to night is as quick and as
absolute as the change from life to death. The sun sank and the world was
wreathed in shadows. But not for long, for see, in the east there is a
glow, then a bent edge of silver light, and at last the full bow of the
crescent moon peeps above the plain and shoots its gleaming arrows far
and wide, filling the earth with a faint refulgence, as the glow of a good
man's deeds shines for a while upon his little world after his sun has
set, lighting the fainthearted travellers who follow on towards a fuller
dawn.

<P>&nbsp;We stood and watched the lovely sight, while the stars grew pale
before this chastened majesty, and felt our hearts lifted up in the presence
of a beauty we could not realize, much less describe. Mine has been a rough
life, my reader, but there are a few things I am thankful to have lived
for, and one of them is to have seen that moon rise over Kukuanaland. Presently
our meditations were broken in upon by our polite friend Infadoos.

<P>&nbsp;"If my lords are ready we will journey on to Loo, where a hut
is made ready for my lords to-night. The moon is now bright, so that we
shall not fall on the way."

<P>&nbsp;We assented, and in an hour's time were at the outskirts of the
town, of which the extent, mapped out as it was by thousands of camp-fires,
appeared absolutely endless. Indeed, Good, who was always fond of a bad
joke, christened it "Unlimited Loo." Presently we came to a moat with a
drawbridge, where we were met by the rattling of arms and the hoarse challenge
of a sentry. Infadoos gave some password that I could not catch, which
was met with a salute, and we passed on through the central street of the
great grass city. After nearly half an hour's tramp past endless lines
of huts, Infadoos at last halted at the gate of a little group of huts
which surrounded a small courtyard of powdered limestone, and informed
us that these were to be our "poor" quarters.

<P>&nbsp;We entered, and found that a hut had been assigned to each of
us. These huts were superior to any which we had yet seen, and in each
was a most comfortable bed made of tanned skins spread upon mattresses
of aromatic grass. Food, too, was ready for us, and as soon as we had washed
ourselves with water, which stood ready in earthenware jars, some young
women of handsome appearance brought us roasted meat and mealie cobs daintily
served on wooden platters, and presented it to us with deep obeisances.

<P>&nbsp;We ate and drank, and then, the beds having by our request been
all moved into one hut, a precaution at which the amiable young ladles
smiled, we flung ourselves down to sleep, thoroughly wearied out with our
long journey.

<P>&nbsp;When we woke, it was to find that the sun was high in the heavens,
and that the female attendants, who did not seem to be troubled by any
false shame, were already standing inside the hut, having been ordered
to attend and help us to "make ready."

<P>&nbsp;"Make ready, indeed," growled Good; "when one has only a flannel
shirt and a pair of boots, that does not take long. I wish you would ask
them for my trousers."

<P>&nbsp;I asked accordingly, but was informed that those sacred relics
had already been taken to the king, who would see us in the forenoon.

<P>&nbsp;Having, somewhat to their astonishment and disappointment, requested
the young ladies to step outside, we proceeded to make the best toilet
that the circumstances admitted of. Good even went the length of again
shaving the right side of his face; the left, on which now appeared a very
fair crop of whiskers, we impressed upon him he must on no account touch.
As for ourselves, we were contented with a good wash and combing our hair.
Sir Henry's yellow locks were now almost down to his shoulders, and he
looked more like an ancient Dane than ever, while my grizzled scrub was
fully an inch long, instead of half an inch, which in a general way I considered
my maximum length.

<P>&nbsp;By the time that we had eaten our breakfast and smoked a pipe,
a message was brought to us by no less a personage than Infadoos himself
that Twala, the king, was ready to see us, if we would be pleased to come.

<P>&nbsp;We remarked in reply that we should prefer to wait until the sun
was a little higher, we were yet weary with our journey, etc. It is always
well, when dealing with uncivilized people, not to be in too great a hurry.
They are apt to mistake politeness for awe or servility. So, although we
were quite as anxious to see Twala as Twala could be to see us, we sat
down and waited for an hour, employing the interval in preparing such presents
as our slender stock of goods permitted - namely, the Winchester rifle
which had been used by poor Ventv&ouml;gel, and some beads. The rifle and
ammunition we determined to present to his royal highness, and the beads
were for his wives and courtiers. We had already given a few to Infadoos
and Scragga, and found that they were delighted with them, never having
seen anything like them before. At length we declared that we were ready,
and, guided by Infadoos, started off to the lev&eacute;e, Umbopa carrying
the rifle and beads.

<P>&nbsp;After walking a few hundred yards we came to an enclosure, something
like that which surrounded the huts that had been allotted to us, only
fifty times as big. It could not have been less than six or seven acres
in extent. All round the outside fence was a row of huts, which were the
habitations of the king's wives. Exactly opposite the gateway, on the farther
side of the open space, was a very large hut, which stood by itself, in
which his majesty resided. All the rest was open ground; that is to say,
it would have been open had it not been filled by company after company
of warriors, who were mustered there to the number of seven or eight thousand.
These men stood still as statues as we advanced through them, and it would
be impossible to give an idea of the grandeur of the spectacle which they
presented, in their waving plumes, their glancing spears, and iron-backed
ox-hide shields.

<P>&nbsp;The space in front of the large hut was empty, but before it were
placed several stools. On three of these, at a sign from Infadoos, we seated
ourselves, Umbopa standing behind us. As for Infadoos, he took up a position
by the door of the hut. So we waited for ten minutes or more in the midst
of a dead silence, but conscious that we were the object of the concentrated
gaze of some eight thousand pairs of eyes. It was a somewhat trying ordeal,
but we carried it off as best we could. At length the door of the hut opened,
and a gigantic figure, with a splendid tiger-skin karross flung over its
shoulders, stepped out, followed by the boy Scragga, and what appeared
to us to be a withered-up monkey wrapped in a fur cloak. The figure seated
itself upon a stool, Scragga took his stand behind it, and the withered-up
monkey crept on all fours into the shade of the hut and squatted down.
Still there was silence.

<P>&nbsp;Then the gigantic figure slipped off the karross and stood up
before us, a truly alarming spectacle. It was that of an enormous man with
the most entirely repulsive countenance we had ever beheld. The lips were
as thick as a negro's, the nose was flat, it had but one gleaming black
eye (for the other was represented by a hollow in the face), and its whole
expression was cruel and sensual to a degree. From the large head rose
a magnificent plume of white ostrich feathers, the body was clad in a shirt
of shining chain armor, while round the waist and right knee was the usual
garnish of white ox-tails. In the right hand was a huge spear. Round the
neck was a thick torque of gold, and bound on to the forehead was a single
and enormous uncut diamond.

<P>&nbsp;Still there was silence; but not for long. Presently the figure,
whom we rightly guessed to be the king, raised the great spear in his hand.
Instantly eight thousand spears were raised in answer, and from eight thousand
throats rang out the royal salute of "<I>Koom</I>!" Three times this was
repeated, and each time the earth shook with the noise, that can only be
compared to the deepest notes of thunder.

<P>&nbsp;"Be humble, O people," piped out a thin voice which seemed to
come from the monkey in the shade; "it is the king."

<P>&nbsp;"<I>It is the king</I>," boomed out eight thousand throats, in
answer. "<I>Be humble, O people; it is the king.</I>"

<P>&nbsp;Then there was silence again - dead silence. Presently, however,
it was broken. A soldier on our left dropped his shield, which fell with
a clatter on the limestone flooring.

<P>&nbsp;Twala turned his one cold eye in the direction of the noise.

<P>&nbsp;"Come. hither, thou," he said, in a voice of thunder.

<P>&nbsp;A fine young man stepped out of the ranks, and stood before him.

<P>&nbsp;"It was thy shield that fell, thou awkward dog. Wilt thou make
me a reproach in the eyes of strangers from the stars? What hast thou to
say?"

<P>&nbsp;And then we saw the poor fellow turn pale under his dusky skin.

<P>&nbsp;"It was by chance, O calf of the black cow," he murmured.

<P>&nbsp;"Then it is a chance for which thou must pay. Thou hast made me
foolish; prepare for death."

<P>&nbsp;"I am the king's ox," was the low answer.

<P>&nbsp;"Scragga," roared the king, "let me see how thou canst use thy
spear. Kill me this awkward dog."

<P>&nbsp;Scragga stepped forward with an ill-favored grin, and lifted his
spear. The poor victim covered his eyes with his hand and stood still.
As for us, we were petrified with horror.

<P>&nbsp;"Once, twice," he waved the spear and then struck, ah, God! right
home - the spear stood out a foot behind the soldier's back. He flung up
his hands and dropped dead. From the multitude around rose something like
a murmur, it rolled round and round, and died away. The tragedy was finished;
there lay the corpse, and we had not yet realized that it had been enacted.
Sir Henry sprang up and swore a great oath, then, overpowered by the sense
of silence, sat down again.

<P>&nbsp;"The thrust was a good one," said the king; "take him away."

<P>&nbsp;Four men stepped out of the ranks, and, lifting the body of the
murdered man, carried it away.

<P>&nbsp;"Cover up the blood-stains, cover them up," piped out the thin
voice from the monkey-like figure; "the king's word is spoken, the king's
doom is done."

<P>&nbsp;Thereupon a girl came. forward from behind the hut, bearing a
jar filled with powdered lime, which she scattered over the red mark, blotting
it from sight.

<P>&nbsp;Sir Henry meanwhile was boiling with rage at what had happened;
indeed, it was with difficulty that we could keep him still.

<P>&nbsp;"Sit down, for Heaven's sake," I whispered; "our lives depend
on it."

<P>&nbsp;He yielded and remained quiet. Twala sat still until the traces
of the tragedy had been removed, then he addressed us.

<P>&nbsp;"White people," he said, "who come hither, whence I know not,
and why I know not, greeting."

<P>&nbsp;"Greeting, Twala, king of the Kukuanas," I answered.

<P>&nbsp;"White people, whence come ye, and what seek ye?"

<P>&nbsp;"We come from the stars, ask us not how. We come to see this land."

<P>&nbsp;"Ye come from far to see a little thing. And that man with ye,"
pointing to Umbopa, "does he too come from the stars?"

<P>&nbsp;"Even so; there are people of thy color in the heavens above;
but ask not of matters too high for thee, Twala, the king."

<P>&nbsp;"Ye speak with a loud voice, people of the stars," Twala answered,
in a tone which I scarcely liked. "Remember that the stars are far off,
and ye are here. How if I make ye as him whom they bare away?"

<P>&nbsp;I laughed out loud, though there was little laughter in my heart.

<P>&nbsp;"O king," I said, "be careful; walk warily over hot stones, lest
thou shouldst burn thy feet; hold the spear by the handle, lest thou shouldst
cut thy hands. Touch but one hair of our heads, and destruction shall come
upon thee. What, have not these," pointing to Infadoos and Scragga (who,
young villain that he was, was employed in cleaning the blood of the soldier
off his spear), "told thee what manner of men we are? Hast thou ever seen
the like of us?" and I pointed to Good, feeling quite sure that he had
never seen anybody before who looked in the least like <I>him</I> as he
then appeared.

<P>&nbsp;"It is true, I have not," said the king.

<P>&nbsp;"Have they not told thee how we strike with death from afar?"
I went on.

<P>&nbsp;"They have told me, but I believe them not. Let me see you kill.
Kill me a man among those who stand yonder" - and he pointed to the opposite
side of the kraal - "and I will believe."

<P>&nbsp;"Nay," I answered; "we shed no blood of man except in just punishment;
but if thou wilt see, bid thy servants drive in an ox through the kraal
gates, and before he has run twenty paces I will strike him dead."

<P>&nbsp;"Nay," laughed the. king, "kill me a man, and I will believe."

<P>&nbsp;"Good, O king, so be it," I answered, coolly; "do thou walk across
the open space, and before thy feet reach the gate thou shalt be dead;
or, if thou wilt not, send thy son Scragga" (whom at that moment it would
have given me much pleasure to shoot).

<P>&nbsp;On hearing this suggestion Scragga gave a sort of howl, and bolted
into the hut.

<P>&nbsp;Twala frowned majestically; the suggestion did not please him.

<P>&nbsp;"Let a young ox be driven in," he said.

<P>&nbsp;Two men at once departed, running swiftly.

<P>&nbsp;"Now, Sir Henry," said I, "do you shoot. I want to show this ruffian
that I am not the only magician of the party."

<P>&nbsp;Sir Henry accordingly took the "express," and made ready.

<P>&nbsp;"I hope I shall make a good shot," he groaned.

<P>&nbsp;"You must," I answered. "If you miss with the first barrel, let
him have the second. Sight for one hundred and fifty yards, and wait till
the beast turns broadside on."

<P>&nbsp;Then came a pause, till presently we caught sight of an ox running
straight for the kraal gate. It came on through the gate, and then, catching
sight of the vast concourse of people, stopped stupidly, turned round,
and bellowed.

<P>&nbsp;"Now's your time," I whispered.

<P>&nbsp;Up went the rifle.

<P>&nbsp;Bang! thud! and the ox was kicking on his back, shot in the ribs:
The semi-hollow bullet had done its work well, and a sigh of astonishment
went up from the assembled thousands.

<P>&nbsp;I turned coolly round -

<P>"Have I lied, O king?"

<P>&nbsp;"Nay, white man, it is a truth," was the somewhat awed answer.

<P>&nbsp;"Listen, Twala," I went on. "Thou hast seen. Now know we come
in peace, not in war. See here" (and I held up the Winchester repeater);
"here is a hollow staff that shall enable you to kill even as we kill,
only this charm I lay upon it, thou shalt kill no man with it. If thou
liftest it against a man, it shall kill thee. Stay, I will show thee. Bid
a man step forty paces and place the shaft of a spear. in the ground so
that the flat blade looks towards us."

<P>&nbsp;In a few seconds it was done.

<P>&nbsp;"Now, see, I will break the spear."

<P>&nbsp;Taking a careful sight, I fired. The bullet struck the flat of
the spear and broke the blade into fragments.

<P>&nbsp;Again the sigh of astonishment went up.

<P>&nbsp;"Now, Twala" (handing him the rifle), "this magic tube we give
to thee, and by and by I will show thee how to use it; but beware how thou
usest the magic of the stars against a man of earth," and I handed him
the rifle. He took it very gingerly, and hid it down at his feet. As he
did so I observed the wizened, monkey-like figure creeping up from the
shadow of the hut. It crept on all fours, but when it reached the place
where the king sat it rose upon its feet, and, throwing the furry covering
off its face, revealed a most extraordinary and weird countenance. It was
(apparently) that of a woman of great age, so shrunken that in size it
was no larger than that of a year-old child, and was made up of a collection
of deep, yellow wrinkles. Set in the wrinkles was a sunken slit that represented
the mouth, beneath which the chin curved outward to a point. There was
no nose to speak of; indeed, the whole countenance might have been taken
for that of a sun-dried corpse had it not been for a pair of large black
eyes, still full of fire and intelligence, which gleamed and played under
the snow-white eyebrows and the projecting parchment-colored skull, like
jewels in a charnel-house. As for the skull itself, it was perfectly bare,
and yellow in hue, while its wrinkled scalp moved and contracted like the
hood of a cobra.

<P>&nbsp;The figure to whom this fearful countenance, which caused a shiver
of fear to pass through us as we gazed on it, belonged stood still for
a moment, and then suddenly projected a skinny claw armed with nails nearly
an inch long, and laid it on the shoulder of Twala, the king, and began
to speak in a thin, piercing voice:

<P>&nbsp;"Listen, O king! Listen, O people! Listen, O mountains and plains
and rivers, home of the Kukuana race! Listen, O skies and sun, O rain and
storm and mist! Listen, all things that live and must die! Listen, all
dead things that must live again - again to die! Listen, the spirit of
life is in me, and I prophesy. I prophesy! I prophesy!"

<P>&nbsp;The words died away in a faint wall, and terror seemed to seize
upon the hearts of all who heard them, including ourselves. The old woman
was very terrible.

<P>&nbsp;"<I>Blood! blood! blood!</I> rivers of blood; blood everywhere.
I see it, I smell it, I taste it - it is salt; it runs red upon the ground,
it rains down from the skies.

<P>&nbsp;"<I>Footsteps! footsteps! footsteps!</I> the tread of the white
man coming from afar. It shakes the earth; the earth trembles before her
master.

<P>&nbsp;"Blood is good, the red blood is bright; there is no smell like
the smell of new-shed blood. The lions shall lap it and roar, the vultures
shall wash their wings in it and shriek in joy.

<P>&nbsp;"I am old! I am old! I have seen much blood; but I shall see more
ere I die, and be merry. How old am I, think ye? Your fathers knew me,
and their fathers hew me, and their fathers' fathers. I have seen the white
man, and how his desires. I am old, but the mountains are older than I.
Who made the great road, tell me? Who wrote in pictures on the rocks, tell
me? Who reared up the three silent ones yonder, who gaze across the pit,
tell me?" (And she pointed towards the three precipitous mountains we had
noticed on the previous night.)

<P>&nbsp;"Ye know not, but I know. It was a white people who were before
ye were, who shall be when ye. are not, who shall eat ye up and destroy
ye. Yea! yea! yea!

<P>&nbsp;"And what came they for, the white ones, the terrible ones, the
skilled in magic and all learning, the strong, the unswerving? What is
that bright stone upon thy forehead, O king? Whose hands made the iron
garments upon thy breast, O king? Ye know not, but I know. I the old one,
I the wise one, I the Isanusi!" (witch doctress.)

<P>&nbsp;Then she turned her bald, vulture head towards us.

<P>&nbsp;"What seek ye, white men of the stars? Ah, yes, of the stars!
Do ye seek a lost one? Ye shall not find him here. He is not here. Never
for ages upon ages has a white foot pressed this land; never but once,
and he left it but to die. Ye come for bright stones; I know it - I know
it; ye shall find them when the blood is dry; but shall ye return whence
ye came, or shall ye stop with me? Ha! ha! ha!

<P>&nbsp;"And thou - thou with the dark skin and the proud beating" (pointing
her skinny finger at Umbopa), "who art <I>thou</I>, and what seekest <I>thou</I>
? Not stones that shine; not yellow metal that gleams; that thou leavest
to `white men from the stars.' Methinks I know thee; methinks I can smell
the smell of the blood in thy veins. Strip off the girdle - "

<P>&nbsp;Here the features of this extraordinary creature became convulsed,
and she fell to the ground foaming in an epileptic fit and was carried
off into the hut.

<P>&nbsp;The king rose up trembling, and waved his hand. Instantly the
regiments began to file off, and in ten minutes, save for ourselves, the
king, and a few attendants, the great space was left clear.

<P>&nbsp;"White people," he said, "it passes in my mind to kill ye. Gagool
has spoken strange words. What say ye?"

<P>&nbsp;I laughed. "Be careful, O king, we are not easy to slay. Thou
hast seen the fate of the ox; wouldst thou be as the ox?"

<P>&nbsp;The king frowned. "It is not well to threaten a king."

<P>&nbsp;"We threaten not, we speak what is true. Try to kill us, O king,
and learn."

<P>&nbsp;The great man put his hand to his forehead.

<P>&nbsp;"Go in peace," he said, at length. "To-night is the great dance.
Ye shall see it. Fear not that I shall set a snare for ye. To-morrow I
shall think."

<P>&nbsp;"It is well, O king," I answered, unconcernedly, and then, accompanied
by Infadoos, we rose and went back to our kraal.
