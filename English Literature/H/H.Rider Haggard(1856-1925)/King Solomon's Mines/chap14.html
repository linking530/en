CHAPTER XIV</H2>

<H3>
THE LAST STAND OF THE GRAYS</H3>
In a few more minutes the regiments destined to carry out the flanking
movements had tramped off in silence, keeping carefully under the lee of
the rising ground in order to conceal the movement from the keen eyes of
Twala's scouts.

<P>&nbsp;Half an hour or more was allowed to elapse between the setting-out
of the horns or wings of the army before any movement was made by the Grays
and the supporting regiments, known as the Buffaloes, which formed its
chest, and which were destined to bear the brunt of the battle.

<P>&nbsp;Both of these regiments were almost perfectly fresh, and of full
strength, the Grays having been in reserve in the morning, and having lost
but a small number of men in sweeping back that part of the attack which
had proved successful in breaking the line of defence on the occasion when
I charged with them and got knocked silly for my pains. As for the Buffaloes,
they had formed the third line of defence on the left, and as the attacking
force at that point had not succeeded in breaking through the second, had
scarcely come into action at all.

<P>&nbsp;Infadoos, who was a wary old general, and knew the absolute importance
of keeping up the spirits of his men on the eve of such a desperate encounter,
employed the pause in addressing his own regiment, the Grays, in poetical
language; in explaining to them the honor that they were receiving in being
put thus in the forefront of the battle, and in having the great white
warrior from the stars to fight with them in their ranks, and in promising
large rewards of cattle and promotion to all who survived in the event
of Ignosi's arms being successful.

<P>&nbsp;I looked down the long lines of waving black plumes and stern
faces beneath them, and sighed to think that within one short. hour most,
if not all, of those magnificent veteran warriors, not a man of whom was
under forty years of age, would be laid dead or dying in the dust. It could
not be otherwise; they were being condemned, with that wise recklessness
of human life that marks the great general, and often saves his forces
and attains his ends, to certain slaughter, in order to give the cause
and the remainder of the army a chance of success. They were foredoomed
to die, and they knew it. It was to be their task to engage regiment after
regiment of Twala's army on the narrow strip of green beneath us, till
they were exterminated, or till the wings found a favorable opportunity
for their onslaught. And yet they. never hesitated, nor could I detect
a sign of fear upon the face of a single warrior. There they were - going
to certain death, about to quit the blessed light of day forever, and yet
able to contemplate their doom without a tremor. I could not, even at that
moment, help contrasting their state of mind with my own, which was far
from comfortable, and breathing a sigh of envy and admiration. Never before
had I seen such an absolute devotion to the idea of duty, and such a complete
indifference to its bitter fruits.

<P>&nbsp;"Behold your king!" ended old Infadoos, pointing to Ignosi; "go
fight and fall for him, as is the duty of brave men, and cursed and shameful
forever be the name of him who shrinks from death for his king, or who
turns his back to his enemy. Behold your king! chiefs, captains, and soldiers;
now do your homage to the sacred snake, and then follow on, that Incubu
and I may show ye the road to the heart of Twala's forces."

<P>&nbsp;There was a moment's pause, then suddenly there rose from the
serried phalanxes before us a murmur, like the distant whisper of the sea,
caused by the gentle tapping of the handles of six thousand spears against
their holders' shields. Slowly it swelled, till its growing volume deepened
and widened into a roar of rolling noise, that echoed like thunder against
the mountains, and filled the air with heavy waves of sound. Then it decreased
and slowly died away into nothing, and suddenly out crashed the royal salute.

<P>&nbsp;Ignosi, I thought to myself, might well be a proud man that day,
for no Roman emperor ever had such a salutation from gladiators "about
to-die."

<P>&nbsp;Ignosi acknowledged this magnificent act of homage by lifting
his battle-axe, and then the Grays filed off in a triple line formation,
each line containing about one thousand fighting men, exclusive of officers.
When the last line had gone some five hundred yards, Ignosi put himself
at the head of the Buffaloes, which regiment was drawn up in a similar
three-line formation, and gave the word to march, and off we went, I, needless
to say, uttering the most heartfelt prayers that I might come out of that
job with a whole skin. Many a queer position have I found myself in, but
never before in one quite so unpleasant as the present, or one in which
my chance of coming off safe was so small.

<P>&nbsp;By the time that we reached the edge of the plateau the Grays
were already half-way down the slope ending in the tongue of grass-land
that ran up into the bend of the mountain, something as the frog of a horse's
foot runs up into the shoe. The excitement in Twala's camp on the plain
beyond was very great, and regiment after regiment was starting forward
at a long swinging trot in order to reach the root of the tongue of land
before the attacking force could emerge into the plain of Loo.

<P>&nbsp;This tongue of land, which was some three hundred yards in depth,
was, even at its root or widest part, not more than three hundred and fifty
paces across, while at its tip it scarcely measured ninety. The Grays,
who, in passing down the side of the hill and on to the tip of the tongue,
had formed in column, on reaching the spot where it broadened out again
reassumed their triple-line formation and halted dead.

<P>&nbsp;Then we - that is, the Buffaloes-moved down the tip of the tongue
and took our stand in reserve, about one hundred yards behind the last
line of the Grays, and on slightly higher ground. Meanwhile we had leisure
to observe Twala's entire force, which had evidently been reinforced since
the morning attack, and could not now, notwithstanding their losses, number
less than forty thousand, moving swiftly up towards us. But as they drew
near the root of the tongue they hesitated, having discovered that only
one regiment could advance into the gorge at a time, and that there, some
seventy yards from the mouth of it, unassailable except in front, on account
of the high walls of boulder-strewn ground on either side, stood the famous
regiment of Grays, the pride and glory of the Kukuana army, ready to hold
the way against their forces as the three Romans once held the bridge against
thousands. They hesitated, and finally stopped their advance; there was
no eagerness to cross spears with those three lines of grim warriors who
stood so firm and ready. Presently, however, a tall general, with the customary
head-dress of nodding ostrich plumes, came running up, attended by a group
of chiefs and orderlies, being, I thought, none other than Twala himself,
and gave an order, and the first regiment raised a shout, and charged up
towards the Grays, who remained perfectly still and silent until the attacking
troops were within forty yards, and a volley of tollas, or throwing-knives,
came rattling among their ranks.

<P>&nbsp;Then suddenly, with a bound and a roar, they sprang forward with
uplifted spears, and the two regiments met in deadly strife. Next second
the roll of the meeting shields came to our ears like the sound of thunder
and the whole plain seemed to be alive with flashes of light reflected
from the stabbing spears. To and fro swung the heaving mass of struggling,
stabbing humanity, but not for long. Suddenly the attacking lines seemed
to grow thinner, and then with a slow, long heave the Grays passed over
them, just as a great wave heaves up and passes over a sunken ridge. It
was done; that regiment was completely destroyed, but the Grays had but
two lines left now; a third of their number were dead.

<P>&nbsp;Closing up shoulder to shoulder once more, they halted in silence
and awaited attack; and I was rejoiced to catch sight of Sir Henry's yellow
beard as he moved to and fro, arranging the ranks. So he was yet alive!

<P>&nbsp;Meanwhile we moved up on to the ground of the encounter, which
was cumbered by about four thousand prostrate human beings, dead, dying,
and wounded, and literally stained red with blood. Ignosi issued an order,
which was rapidly passed down the ranks, to the effect that none of the
enemy's wounded were to be killed, and, so far as we could see, this order
was scrupulously carried out. It would have been a shocking sight, if we
had had time to think of it.

<P>&nbsp;But now a second regiment, distinguished by white plumes, kilts,
and shields, was moving up to the attack of the two thousand remaining
Grays, who stood waiting in the same ominous silence as before, till the
foe was within forty yards or so, when they hurled themselves with irresistible
force upon them. Again there came the awful roll of the meeting shields,
and as we watched, the grim tragedy repeated itself. But this time the
the issue was left longer in doubt; indeed it seemed for a while almost
impossible that the Grays should again prevail. The attacking regiment,
which was one formed of young men, fought with the utmost fury, and at
first seemed by sheer weight to be driving the veterans back. The slaughter
was something awful, hundreds falling every minute; and from among the
shouts of the warriors and the groans of the dying, set to the clashing
music of meeting spears, came a continuous hissing undertone of "<I>S'gee,
s'gee,</I>" the note of triumph of each victor as he passed his spear through
and through the body of his fallen foe.

<P>&nbsp;But perfect discipline and steady and unchanging valor can do
wonders, and one veteran soldier is worth two young ones, as soon became
apparent in the present case. For just as we thought that it was all up
with the Grays, and were preparing to take their place so soon as they
made room by being destroyed, I heard Sir Henry's deep voice ringing out
above the din, and caught a glimpse of his circling battle-axe as he waved
it high above his plumes. Then came a change; the Grays ceased to give;
they stood still as a rock, against which the furious waves of spearmen
broke again and again, only to recoil. Presently they began to move again
- forward this time; as they had no firearms there was no smoke, so we
could see it all. Another minute and the onslaught grew fainter.

<P>&nbsp;"Ah, they are <I>men</I> indeed; they will conquer again," called
out Ignosi, who was grinding his teeth with excitement at my side. "See,
it is done!"

<P>&nbsp;Suddenly, like puffs of smoke from the mouth of a cannon, the
attacking regiment broke away in flying groups, their white head-dresses
streaming behind them in the wind, and left their opponents victors, indeed,
but, alas! no more a regiment. Of the gallant triple line, which, forty
minutes before, had gone into action three thousand strong, there remained
at most some six hundred blood-bespattered men; the rest were under foot.
And yet they cheered and waved their spears in triumph, and then, instead
of falling back upon us as we expected, they ran forward, for a hundred
yards or so, after the flying groups of foemen, took possession of a gently
rising knoll of ground, and, resuming the old triple formation, formed
a three-fold ring around it. And then, thanks be to God, standing on the
top of a mound for a minute, I saw Sir Henry, apparently unharmed, and
with him our old friend Infadoos. Then Twala's regiments rolled down upon
the doomed band, and once more the battle closed in.

<P>&nbsp;As those who read this history will probably long ago have gathered,
I am, to be honest, a bit of a coward, and certainly in no way given to
fighting, though, somehow, it has often been my lot to get into unpleasant
positions, and to be obliged to shed man's blood. But I have always hated
it, and kept my own blood as undiminished in quantity as possible, sometimes
by a judicious use of my heels. At this moment, however, for the first
time in my life, I felt my bosom burn with martial ardor. War-like fragments
from the "Ingoldsby Legends," together with numbers of sanguinary verses
from the Old Testament, sprang up in my brain like mushrooms in the dark;
my blood, which hitherto had been half-frozen with horror, went beating
through my veins, and there came upon me a savage desire to kill and spare
not. I glanced round at the serried ranks of warriors behind us, and somehow,
all in an instant, began to wonder if my face looked like theirs. There
they stood, their heads craned forward over their shields, the hands twitching,
the lips apart, the fierce features instinct with the hungry lust of battle,
and in the eyes a look like the glare of a bloodhound when he sights his
quarry.

<P>&nbsp;Only Ignosi's heart seemed, to judge from his comparative self-possession,
to all appearance, to beat as calmly as ever beneath his leopard-skin cloak,
though even he still kept on grinding his teeth. I could stand it no longer.

<P>&nbsp;"Are we to stand here till we put out roots, Umbopa - Ignosi,
I mean - while Twala swallows our brothers yonder?" I asked;

<P>&nbsp;"Nay, Macumazahn," was the answer; "see, now is the ripe moment;
let us pluck it."

<P>&nbsp;As he spoke a fresh regiment rushed past the ring upon the little
mound, and, wheeling round, attacked it from the hither side.

<P>&nbsp;'Then, lifting his battle-axe, Ignosi gave the signal to advance,
and, raising the Kukuana battle-cry, the Buffaloes charged home with a
rush like the rush of the sea.

<P>&nbsp;What followed immediately on this it is out of my power to tell.
All I can remember is a wild yet ordered rushing, that seemed to shake
the ground; a sudden change of front and forming up on the part of the
regiment against which the charge was directed; then the awful shock, a
dull roar of voices, and a continuous flashing of spears, seen through
a red mist of blood.

<P>&nbsp;When my mind cleared I found. myself standing inside the remnant
of the Grays near the top of the mound, and just behind no less a person
than Sir Henry himself. How I got there I had, at the moment, no idea,
but Sir Henry afterwards told me that I was borne up by the first furious
charge of the Buffaloes almost to his feet, and then left, as they in turn
were pressed back. Thereon he dashed out of the circle and dragged me into
it.

<P>&nbsp;As for the fight that followed, who can describe it? Again and
again the multitudes surged up against our momentarily lessening circle,
and again and again we beat them back.

<P>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE>"The stubborn spearsmen still made good
<BR>The dark impenetrable wood;
<BR>Each stepping where his comrade stood
<BR>The instant that he fell,"</BLOCKQUOTE>
as I think the "Ingoldsby Legends" beautifully puts it.

<P>&nbsp;It was a splendid thing to see those brave battalions come on
time. after time over the barriers of their dead, sometimes holding corpses
before them to receive our spear-thrusts, only to leave their own corpses
to swell the rising piles. It was a gallant sight to see that sturdy old
warrior, Infadoos, as cool as though he were on parade, shouting out orders,
taunts, and even jests, to keep up the spirit of his few remaining men,
and then, as each charge rolled up, stepping forward to wherever the fighting
was thickest, to bear his share in repelling it. And yet more gallant was
the vision of Sir Henry, whose ostrich plumes had been torn off by a spear-stroke,
so that his long yellow hair streamed out in the breeze behind him.

<P>&nbsp;There he stood, the great Dane, for he was nothing else, his hands,
his axe, and his armor all red with blood, and none could live before his
stroke. Time after time I saw it come sweeping down, as some great warrior
ventured to give him battle, and as he struck he shouted, "<I>Oh-hoy! O-hoy!</I>"
like his Bersekir forefathers, and the blow went crashing through shield
and spear, through headdress, hair, and skull, till at last none would
of their own will come near the great white "tagati" (wizard), who killed
and failed not.

<P>&nbsp;But suddenly there rose a cry of "<I>Twala, y' Twala</I>" and
out of the press sprang forward none other than the gigantic one-eyed king
himself, also armed with battle-axe and shield, and clad in chain armor.

<P>&nbsp;"Where art thou, Incubu, thou white man, who slew Scragga, my
son - see if thou canst kill me!" he shouted, and at the same time hurled
a tolla straight at Sir Henry, who, fortunately, saw it coming, and caught
it on his shield, which transfixed it, remaining wedged in the iron plate
behind the hide.

<P>&nbsp;Then with a cry, Twala sprang forward straight at him, and with
his battle-axe struck him such a blow upon the shield that the mere force
and shock of it brought Sir Henry, strong man as he was, down upon his
knees.

<P>&nbsp;But at the time the matter went no further, for at that instant
there rose from the regiments pressing round us something like a shout
of dismay, and on looking up I saw the cause.

<P>&nbsp;To the right and to the left the plain was alive with the plumes
of charging warriors. The outflanking squadrons had come to our relief.
The time could not have been better chosen. All Twala's army had, as Ignosi
had predicted would be the case, fixed their attention on the bloody struggle
which was raging round the remnant of the Grays and the Buffaloes, who
were now carrying on a battle of their own at a little distance, which
two regiments had formed the chest of our army. It was not until the horns
were about to close upon them that they had dreamed of their approach.
And now, before they could even assume a proper formation for defence,
the outflanking Impis had leaped, like greyhounds, on their flanks.

<P>&nbsp;In five minutes the fate of the battle was decided. Taken on both
flanks, and dismayed by the awful slaughter inflicted upon them by the
Grays and Buffaloes, Twala's regiments broke into flight, and soon the
whole plain between us and Loo was scattered with groups of flying soldiers,
making good their retreat. As for the forces that had so recently surrounded
us and the Buffaloes, they melted away as though by magic, and presently
we were left standing there like a rock from which the sea has retreated.
But what a sight it was! Around us the dead and dying lay in heaped-up
masses, and of the gallant Grays there remained alive but ninety-five men.
More than two thousand nine hundred had fallen in this one regiment, most
of them never to rise again.

<P>&nbsp;"Men," said Infadoos, calmly, as between the intervals of binding
up a wound in his arm he surveyed what remained to him of his corps, "ye
have kept up the reputation of your regiment, and this day's fighting will
be spoken of by your children's children." Then he turned round and shook
Sir Henry Curtis by the hand. "Thou art a great man, Incubu," he said,
simply; "I have lived a long life among warriors, and known. many a brave
one, yet have I never seen a man like thee."

<P>&nbsp;At this moment the Buffaloes began to march past our position
on the road to Loo, and as they did so a message was brought to us from
Ignosi requesting Infadoos, Sir Henry, and myself to join him. Accordingly,
orders having been issued to the remaining ninety men of the Grays to employ
themselves in collecting the wounded, we joined Ignosi, who informed us
that he was pressing on to Loo to complete the victory by capturing Twala,
if that should be possible. Before we had gone far we suddenly discovered
the figure of Good sitting on an ant-heap about one hundred paces from
us. Close beside him was the body of a Kukuana.

<P>&nbsp;"He must be wounded," said Sir Henry, anxiously. As he made the
remark, an untoward thing happened. The dead body of the Kukuana soldier,
or rather what had appeared to be his dead body, suddenly sprang up, knocked
Good head over heels off the ant-heap, and began to spear him. We rushed
forward in terror, and as we drew near we saw the brawny warrior making
dig after dig at the prostrate Good, who at each prod jerked all his limbs
into the air. Seeing us coming, the Kukuana gave one final most vicious
dig, and with a shout of "Take that, wizard," bolted off. Good did not
move, and we concluded that our poor comrade was done for. Sadly we came
towards him, and were indeed astonished to find him pale and faint indeed,
but with a serene smile upon his face, and his eyeglass still fixed in
his eye.

<P>&nbsp;"Capital armor this," he murmured, on catching sight of our faces
bending over him. "How sold he must have been," and then he fainted. On
examination we discovered that he had been seriously wounded in the leg
by a tolla in the course of the pursuit, but that the chain-armor had prevented
his last assailant's spear from doing anything more than bruise him badly.
It was a merciful escape. As nothing could be done for him at the moment,
he was placed on one of the wicker shields used for the wounded, and carried
along with us.

<P>&nbsp;On arriving before the nearest gate of Loo we found one of our
regiments watching it in obedience to orders received from Ignosi. The
remaining regiments were in the same way watching the other exits to the
town. The officer in command of this regiment coming up, saluted lgnosi
as king, and informed him that Twala's army had taken refuge in the town,
whither Twala himself had also escaped, but that he thought they were thoroughly
demoralized, and. would surrender. Thereupon lgnosi, after taking counsel
with us, sent forward heralds to each gate ordering the defenders to open,
and promising on his royal word life and forgiveness to every soldier who
laid down his arms. The message was not without its effect. Presently,
amid the shouts and cheers of the Buffaloes, the bridge was dropped across
the fosse, and the gates upon the farther side flung open.

<P>&nbsp;Taking due precautions against treachery, we marched on into the
town. All along the roadways stood dejected warriors, their heads drooping
and their shields and spears at their feet, who, as Ignosi passed, saluted
him as king. On we marched, straight to Twala's kraal. When we reached
the great space, where a day or two previously we had seen the review and
the witch-hunt, we found it deserted. No, not quite deserted, for there,
on the farther side, in front of his hut, sat Twala himself, with but one
attendant - Gagool.

<P>&nbsp;It was a melancholy sight to see him seated there, his battle-axe
and shield by his side, his chin upon his mailed breast, with but one old
crone for companion, and, notwithstanding his cruelties and misdeeds, a
pang of compassion shot through me as I saw him thus "fallen from his high
estate." Not a soldier of all his armies, not a courtier out of the hundreds
who had cringed round him, not even a solitary wife, remained to share
his fate or halve the bitterness of his fall. Poor savage! he was learning
the lesson that fate teaches to most who live long enough, that the eyes
of mankind are blind to the discredited, and that he who is defenceless
and fallen finds few friends and little mercy. Nor, indeed, in this case
did he deserve any.

<P>&nbsp;Filing through the kraal gate, we marched straight across the
open space to where the ex-king sat. When within about fifty yards the
regiment was halted, and, accompanied only by a small guard, we advanced
towards him, Gagool reviling us bitterly as we came. As we drew near, Twala,
for the first time, lifted up his plumed head, and fixed his one eye, which
seemed to flash with suppressed fury almost as brightly as the great diadem
bound round his forehead, upon his successful rival - Ignosi.

<P>&nbsp;"Hail, O king!" he said, with bitter mockery; "thou who hast eaten
of my bread, and now by the aid of the white man's magic hast seduced my
regiments and defeated mine army, hail! what fate hast thou for me, O king?"

<P>&nbsp;"The fate thou gavest to my father, whose throne thou hast sat
on these many years!" was the stern answer.

<P>&nbsp;"It is well. I will show thee how to die, that thou mayest remember
it against thine own time. See, the sun sinks in blood," and he pointed
with his red battle-axe towards the fiery orb now going down; "it is well
that my sun should sink with it. And now, O king! I am ready to die, but
I crave the boon of the Kukuana royal house to die fighting. Thou canst
not refuse it, or even those cowards who fled to-day will hold thee shamed."

<P>&nbsp;"It is granted. Choose - with whom wilt thou fight? Myself, I
cannot fight with thee, for the king fights not except in war."

<P>&nbsp;Twala's sombre eye ran up and down our ranks, and I felt, as for
a moment it rested on myself, that the position had developed a new horror.
What if he chose to begin by fighting me? What chance should I have against
a desperate savage six feet five high, and broad in proportion? I might
as well commit suicide at once. Hastily I made up my mind to decline the
combat, even if I were hooted out of Kukuanaland as a consequence. It is,
I think, better to be hooted than to be quartered with a battle-axe.

<P>&nbsp;Presently he spoke.

<P>&nbsp;"Incubu, what sayest thou, shall we end what we began to-day,
or shall I call thee coward, white - even to the liver?"

<P>&nbsp;"Nay," interposed Ignosi, hastily; "thou shalt not fight with
Incubu."

<P>&nbsp;"Not if he is afraid," said Twala.

<P>&nbsp;Unfortunately Sir Henry understood this remark, and the blood
flamed up into his cheeks.

<P>&nbsp;"I will fight him." he said; "he shall see if I am afraid."

<P>&nbsp;"For God's sake," I entreated, "don't risk your life against that
of a desperate man. Anybody who saw you to-day will know that you are not
a coward."

<P>&nbsp;"I will fight him," was the sullen answer. "No living man shall
call me a coward. I am ready now!" and he stepped forward and lifted his
axe.

<P>&nbsp;I wrung my hands over this absurd piece of Quixotism; but if he
was determined on fighting, of course I could not stop him.

<P>&nbsp;"Fight not, my white brother," said Ignosi, laying his hand affectionately
on Sir Henry's arm; "thou hast fought enough, and if aught befell thee
at his hands it would cut my heart in twain."

<P>&nbsp;"I will fight, Ignosi," was Sir Henry's answer.

<P>&nbsp;"It is well, Incubu; thou art a brave man. It will be a good fight.
Behold. Twala, the Elephant is ready for thee,"

<P>&nbsp;The ex-king laughed savagely, and stepped forward and faced Curtis.
For a moment they stood thus, and the setting sun caught their stalwart
frames and clothed them both in fire. They were a well-matched pair.

<P>&nbsp;Then they began to circle round each other, their battle-axes
raised.

<P>&nbsp;Suddenly Sir Henry sprang forward and struck a fearful blow at
Twala, who stepped to one side. So heavy was the stroke that the striker
half overbalanced himself, a circumstance of which his antagonist took
a prompt advantage. Circling his heavy battle-axe round his head he brought
it down with tremendous force. My heart jumped into my mouth; I thought
the affair was already finished. But no; with a quick upward movement of
the left arm Sir Henry interposed his shield between himself and the axe,
with the result that its outer edge was shorn clean off, the axe falling
on his left shoulder, but not heavily enough to do any serious damage.
In another second Sir Henry got in another blow, which was also received
by Twala upon his shield. Then followed blow upon blow, which were in turn,
either received upon the shield or avoided. The excitement grew intense;
the regiment which was watching the encounter forgot its discipline, and,
drawing near, shouted and groaned at every stroke. Just at this time, too.
Good, who had been lad upon the ground by me, recovered from his faint,
and. sitting up. perceived what was going on. In an instant he was up,
and, catching hold of my arm, hopped about from place to place on one leg,
dragging me after him, yelling out encouragements to Sir Henry -

<P>"Go it, old fellow!" he hallooed. "That was a good one! Give it him
amidships," and so on.

<P>&nbsp;Presently Sir Henry having caught a fresh stroke upon his shield,
hit out with all his force. The stroke cut through Twala's shield and through
the tough chain armor behind it, gashing him in the shoulder. With a yell
of pain and fury Twala returned the stroke with interest, and, such was
his strength, shore right through the rhinoceros-horn handle of his antagonist's
battle-axe, strengthened as it was with bands of steel wounding Curtis
in the face.

<P>&nbsp;A cry of dismay rose from the Buffaloes as our hero's broad axe-head
fell to the ground; and Twala, again raising his weapon, flew at him with
a shout. I shut my eyes. When I opened them again, it was to see Sir Henry's
shield lying on the ground, and Sir Henry himself with his great arms twined
round Twala's middle. To and fro they swung, hugging each other like bears,
straining with all their mighty muscles for dear life and dearer honor.
With a supreme effort Twala swung the Englishman clean off his feet, and
down they came together, rolling over and over on the lime paving, Twala
striking out at Curtis's head with the battle-axe, and Sir Henry trying
to drive the tolla he had drawn from his belt through Twala's armor.

<P>&nbsp;It was a mighty struggle and an awful thing to see.

<P>&nbsp;"Get his axe!" yelled Good; and perhaps our champion heard him.

<P>&nbsp;At any rate, dropping the tolla, he made a grab at the axe, which
was fastened to Twala's wrist by a strip of buffalo-hide, and, still rolling
over and over, they fought for it like wildcats, drawing their breath in
heavy gasps. Suddenly the hide string burst, and then, with a great effort,
Sir Henry freed himself, the weapon remaining in his grasp. Another second
and he was up on his feet, the red blood streaming from the wound in his
face, and so was Twala. Drawing the heavy tolla from his belt, he staggered
straight at Curtis and struck him upon the breast. The blow came home true
and strong, but whoever it was made that chain armor understood his art,
for it withstood the steel. Again Twala struck out with a savage yell,
and again the heavy knife rebounded and Sir Henry went staggering back.
Once more Twala came on, and as he came our great Englishman gathered himself
together, and, swinging the heavy axe round his head, hit at him with all
his force. There was a shriek of excitement from a thousand throats, and
behold! Twala's head seemed to spring from his shoulders, and then fell
and came rolling and bounding along the ground towards Ignosi, stopping
just at his feet. For a second the corpse stood upright, the blood spouting
in fountains from the severed arteries; then with a dull crash it fell
to the earth, and the gold torque from the neck went rolling away across
the pavement. As it did so Sir Henry, overpowered by faintness and loss
of blood, fell heavily across it.

<P>&nbsp;In a second he was lifted up, and eager hands were pouring water
on his face. Another minute, and the great gray eyes opened wide. He was
not dead.

<P>&nbsp;Then I, just as the sun sank, stepping to where Twala's head lay
in the dust, unloosed the diamond from the dead brows and handed it to
Ignosi.

<P>&nbsp;"Take it," I said, "lawful king of the Kukuanas."

<P>&nbsp;Ignosi bound the diadem upon his brows, and then advancing placed
his foot upon the broad chest of his headless foe and broke out into a
chant, or rather a paean of victory, so beautiful, and yet so utterly savage,
that I despair of being able to give an adequate idea of it. I once heard
a scholar with a fine voice read aloud from the Greek poet Homer, and I
remember that the sound of the rolling lines seemed to make my blood stand
still. Ignosi's chant, uttered as it was in a language as beautiful and
sonorous as the old Greek, produced exactly the same effect on me, although
I was exhausted with toil and many emotions.

<P>&nbsp;"<I>Now</I>," he began, "<I>now is our rebellion swallowed up
in victory, and our evil-doing justified by strength</I>.

<P>&nbsp;"<I>In the morning the oppressors rose up and shook themselves;
they bound on their plumes and made them ready for war</I>.

<P>&nbsp;"<I>They rose up and grasped their spears; the soldiers called
to the captains, `Come, lead us and the captains cried to the king, `Direct
thou the battle</I>.'

<P>&nbsp;"<I>They rose up in their pride, twenty thousand men, and yet
a twenty thousand.</I>

<P>&nbsp;"<I>Their plumes covered the earth as the plumes of a bird cover
her nest; they shook their spears and shouted, yea, they hurled their spears
into the sunlight; they lusted for the battle and were glad. "They came
up against me; their strong ones came running swiftly to crush me; they
cried, `Ha! ha! he is as one already dead</I>.'

<P>&nbsp;"<I>Then breathed I on them, and my breath was as the breath of
a storm, and lo! they were not</I>.

<P>&nbsp;"<I>My lightnings pierced them; I licked up their strength with
the lightning of my spears; I shook them to the earth with the thunder
of my shouting</I>.

<P>&nbsp;"<I>They broke - they scattered - they were gone as the mists
of the morning</I>.

<P>&nbsp;"<I>They are food for the crows and the foxes, and the place of
battle is fat with their blood</I>.

<P>&nbsp;"<I>Where are the mighty ones who rose up in the morning</I>?

<P>&nbsp;"<I>Where are the proud ones who tossed their plumes and cried,
`He is as one already dead'</I>?

<P>&nbsp;"<I>They bow their heads, but not in sleep; they are stretched
out, but not in sleep</I>.

<P>&nbsp;"<I>They are forgotten; they have gone into the blackness, and
shall not return; yea, others shall lead away their wives, and their children
shall remember them no more</I>.

<P>&nbsp;"<I>And I - I! the king - like an eagle have I found my eyrie</I>.

<P>&nbsp;"<I>Behold! far have I wandered in the night-time, yet have I
returned to my little ones at the daybreak</I>.

<P>&nbsp;"<I>Creep ye under the shadow of my wings, O people, and I will
comfort ye, and ye shall not be dismayed</I>.

<P>&nbsp;"<I>Now is the good time, the time of spoil</I>.

<P>&nbsp;"<I>Mine are the cattle in the valleys, the virgins in the kraals
are mine also</I>.

<P>&nbsp;"<I>The winter is overpast, the summer is at hand</I>.

<P>&nbsp;"<I>Now shall Evil cover up her face, and prosperity shall bloom
in the land like a lily</I>.

<P>&nbsp;"<I>Rejoice, rejoice, my people! let all the land rejoice in that
the tyranny is trodden down, in that I am the king</I>."

<P>&nbsp;He paused, and out of the gathering gloom there came back the
deep deeply:

<P>&nbsp;"<I>Thou art the king</I>."

<P>&nbsp;Thus it was that my prophecy to the herald came true, and within
the forty-eight hours Twala's headless corpse was stiffening at Twala's
gate.
