CHAPTER VI</H2>

<H3>
WATER! WATER!</H3>
IN two hours' time, about four o'clock, I woke up. As soon as the first
heavy demand of bodily fatigue had been satisfied the torturing thirst
from which I was suffering asserted itself. I could sleep no more. I had
been dreaming that I was bathing in a running stream with green banks,
and trees upon them, and I awoke to find myself in that arid wilderness,
and to remember that, as Umbopa had said, if we did not find water that
day we must certainly perish miserably. No human creature could live long
without water in that heat. I sat up and rubbed my grimy face with my dry
and horny hands. My lips and eyelids were stuck. together, and it was only
after some rubbing and with an effort that I was able to open them. It
was not far off the dawn, but there was none of the bright feel of dawn
in the air, which was thick with a hot murkiness I cannot describe. The
others were still sleeping. Presently it began to grow light enough to
read, so I drew out a little pocket copy of the "Ingoldsby Legends" I had
brought with me, and read the. "Jackdaw of Rheims." When I got to where

<P>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE>"A nice little boy held a golden ewer,
<BR>Embossed, and filled with water as pure
<BR>As any that flows between Rheims and Namur,"</BLOCKQUOTE>
I literally smacked my cracked lips, or, rather, tried to smack them. The
mere thought of that pure water made me mad. If the cardinal had been there
with his bell, book, and candle, I would have whipped in and drank his
water up, yes, even if he had already filled it with the suds of soap worthy
of washing the hands of the pope, and I knew that the whole concentrated
curse of the Catholic Church should fall upon me for so doing. I almost
think I must have been a little light-headed with thirst and weariness
and want of food; for I fell to thinking how astonished the cardinal and
his nice little boy and the jackdaw would have looked to see a burned-up
brown-eyed, grizzled-haired little elephant-hunter suddenly bound in and
put his dirty face into the basin and swallow every drop of the precious
water. The idea amused me so that I laughed or rather cackled aloud, which
woke the others up, and they began to rub <I>their</I> dirty faces and
get <I>their</I> gummed-up lips and eyelids apart.

<P>&nbsp;As soon as we were all well awake we fell to discussing the situation,
which was serious enough. Not a drop of water was left. We turned the water-bottles
upside down and licked the tops, but it was a failure; they were as dry
as a bone. Good, who had charge of the bottle of brandy, got it out and
looked at it longingly; but Sir Henry promptly took it away from him, for
to drink raw spirit would only have been to precipitate the end.

<P>&nbsp;"If we do not find water we shall die," he said.

<P>&nbsp;"If we can trust to the old don's map there should be some about,"
I said; but nobody seemed to derive much satisfaction from that remark,
it was so evident that no great faith could be put in the map. It was now
gradually growing light, and as we sat blankly staring at each other I
observed the Hottentot Ventv&ouml;gel rise and begin to walk about with
his eyes on the ground. Presently he stopped short and, uttering a guttural
exclamation, pointed to the earth.

<P>&nbsp;"What is it?" we exclaimed, and simultaneously rose and went to
where he was standing pointing at the ground.

<P>&nbsp;"Well," I said, "it is pretty fresh Springbok spoor; what of it?"

<P>&nbsp;"Springboks do not go far from water," he answered in Dutch.

<P>&nbsp;"No," I answered, "I forgot; and thank God for it." This little
discovery put new life into us; it is wonderful how, when one is in a desperate
position, one catches at the slightest hope, and feels almost happy in
it. On a dark night a single star is better than nothing.

<P>&nbsp;Meanwhile Ventv&ouml;gel was lifting his snub nose, and sniffing
the hot air for all the world like an old Impala ram who scents danger.
Presently he spoke again.

<P>&nbsp;"I <I>smell</I> water," he said.

<P>&nbsp;Then we felt quite jubilant, for we knew what a wonderful instinct
these wild-bred men possess.

<P>&nbsp;Just at that moment the sun came up gloriously and revealed so
grand a sight to our astonished eyes that for a moment or two we forgot
even our thirst.

<P>&nbsp;For there, not more than forty or fifty miles from us, glittering
like silver in the early rays of the morning sun, were Sheba's breasts;
and stretching away for hundreds of miles on each side of them was the
great Suliman Berg. Now that I, sitting here, attempt to describe the extraordinary
grandeur and beauty of that sight, language seems to fail me. I am impotent
even before its memory. There, straight before us, were two enormous mountains,
the like of which are not, I believe, to be seen in Africa, if, indeed,
there are any other such in the world, measuring each at least fifteen
thousand feet in height, standing not more than a dozen miles apart, connected
by a precipitous cliff of rock, and towering up in awful white solemnity
straight into the sky. These mountains standing thus, like the pillars
of a gigantic gateway, are shaped exactly like a woman's breasts. Their
bases swelled gently up from the plain, looking, at that distance, perfectly
round and smooth; and on the top of each was a vast round hillock covered
with snow, exactly corresponding to the nipple on the female breast. The
stretch of cliff which connected them appeared to be some thousand feet
in height, and perfectly precipitous, and on each side of them, as far
as the eye could reach, extended similar lines of cliff, broken only here
and there by flat, table-topped mountains, something like the world famed
one at Cape Town; a formation, by the way, very common in Africa.

<P>&nbsp;To describe the grandeur of the whole view is beyond my powers.
There was something so inexpressibly solemn and overpowering about those
huge volcanoes-for doubtless they are extinct volcanoes - that it fairly
took our breath away. For a while the morning lights played upon the snow
and the brown and swelling masses beneath, and then, as though to veil
the majestic sight from our curious eyes, strange mists and clouds gathered
and increased around them, till presently we could only trace their pure
and gigantic outline swelling ghostlike through the fleecy envelope. Indeed,
as we afterwards discovered, they were normally wrapped in this curious
gauzy mist, which doubtless accounted for one not having made them out
more clearly before.

<P>&nbsp;Scarcely had the mountains vanished into cloud-clad privacy before
our thirst - literally a burning question - reasserted itself.

<P>&nbsp;It was all very well for Ventv&ouml;gel to say he smelled water,
but look which way we would we could see no signs of it. So far as the
eye could reach there was nothing but arid, sweltering sand and karoo scrub.
We walked round the hillock and gazed about anxiously on the other side,
but it was the same story, not a drop of water was to be seen; there was
no indication of a pan, a pool, or a spring.

<P>&nbsp;"You are a fool," I said, angrily, to Ventv&ouml;gel; "there is
no water."

<P>&nbsp;But still he lifted his ugly snub nose and sniffed.

<P>&nbsp;"I smell it, Baas" (master), he answered; "it is somewhere in
the air."

<P>&nbsp;"Yes," I said, "no doubt it is in the clouds, and about two months
hence it will fall and wash our bones."

<P>&nbsp;Sir Henry stroked his yellow beard thoughtfully. "Perhaps it is
on the top of the hill," he suggested.

<P>&nbsp;"Rot," said Good; "who ever heard of water being found on the
top of a hill?"

<P>&nbsp;"Let us go and look," I put in, and hopelessly enough we scrambled
up the sandy sides of the hillock, Umbopa leading. Presently he stopped
as though he were petrified.

<P>&nbsp;"Nanzia manzie!" (here is water), he cried, with a loud voice.

<P>&nbsp;We rushed up to him, and there, sure enough, in a deep cup or
indentation on the very top of the sand-koppie, was an undoubted pool of
water. How it came to be in such a strange place we did not stop to inquire,
nor did we hesitate at its black and uninviting appearance. It was water,
or a good imitation of it, and that was enough for us. We gave a bound
and a rush, and in another second were all down on our stomachs sucking
up the uninviting fluid as though it were nectar fit for the gods. Heavens,
how we did drink! Then, when we had done drinking, we tore off our clothes
and sat down in it, absorbing the moisture through our parched skins. You,
my reader, who have only to turn on a couple of taps and summon "hot" and
"cold" from an unseen, vasty boiler, can have little idea of the luxury
of that muddy wallow in brackish, tepid water.

<P>&nbsp;After a while we arose from it, refreshed indeed, and fell to
on our biltong, of which we had scarcely been able to touch a mouthful
for twenty-four hours, and ate our fill. Then we smoked a pipe, and lay
down by the side of that blessed pool under the overhanging shadow of the
bank and slept till mid-day.

<P>&nbsp;All that day we rested there by the water, thanking our stars
that we had been lucky enough to find it, bad as it was, and not forgetting
to render a due share of gratitude to the shade of the long-departed Da
Silvestra, who had corked it down so accurately on the tail of his shirt.
The wonderful thing to us was that it should have lasted so long, and the
only way that I can account for it is by the supposition that it is fed
by some spring deep down in the sand.

<P>&nbsp;Having filled both ourselves and our water-bottles as full as
possible, in far better spirits we started off again with the moon. That
night we covered nearly five-and-twenty miles, but, needless to say, found
no more water, though we were lucky enough on the following day to get
a little shade behind some ant-heaps. When the sun rose and, for a while,
cleared away the mysterious mists, Suliman's Berg and the two majestic
breasts, now only about twenty miles off, seemed to be towering right above
us, and looked grander than ever. At the approach of evening we started
on again, and, to cut a long story short, by daylight next morning found
ourselves upon the lowest slopes of Sheba's left breast, for which we had
been steadily steering. By this time our water was again exhausted and
we were suffering severely from thirst, nor indeed could we see any chance
of relieving it till we reached the snow line, far, far above us. After
resting an hour or two, driven to it by our torturing thirst, we went on
again, toiling painfully in the burning heat up the lava slopes, for we
found that the huge base of the mountain was composed entirely of lava
beds belched out in some far-past age.

<P>&nbsp;By eleven o'clock we were utterly exhausted, and were, generally
speaking, in a very bad way indeed. The lava clinker, over which we had
to make our way, though comparatively smooth compared with some clinker
I have heard of, such as that on the island of Ascension, for instance,
was yet rough enough to make our feet very sore, and this, together with
our other miseries, had pretty well finished us. A few hundred yards above
us were some large lumps of lava, and towards these we made with the intention
of lying down beneath their shade. We reached them, and to our surprise,
so far as we had a capacity for surprise left in us, on a little plateau
or ridge close by we saw that the lava was covered with a dense green growth.
Evidently soil formed from decomposed lava had rested there, and in due
course had become the receptacle of seeds deposited by birds. But we did
not take much further interest in the green growth, for one cannot live
on grass, like Nebuchadnezzar. That requires a special dispensation of
Providence and peculiar digestive organs. So we sat down under the rocks
and groaned, and I, for one, heartily wished that we had never started
on this fool's errand. As we were siring there I saw Umbopa get up and
hobble off towards the patch of green, and a few minutes afterwards, to
my great astonishment, I perceived that usually uncommonly dignified individual
dancing and shouting like a maniac, and waving something green. Off we
all scrambled towards him as fast as our wearied limbs would carry us,
hoping that he had found water.

<P>&nbsp;"What is it, Umbopa, son of a fool?" I shouted in Zulu.

<P>&nbsp;"It is food and water, Macumazahn," and again he waved the green
thing.

<P>&nbsp;Then I saw what he had got. It was a melon. We had hit upon a
patch of wild melons, thousands of them, and dead ripe.

<P>&nbsp;"Melons!" I yelled to Good, who was next me; and in another second
he had his false teeth fixed in one.

<P>&nbsp;I think we ate about six each before we had done, and, poor fruit
as they were, I doubt if I ever thought anything nicer.

<P>&nbsp;But melons are not very satisfying, and when we had satisfied
our thirst with their pulpy substance, and set a stock to cool by the simple
process of cutting them in two and setting them end on in the hot sun to
get cold by evaporation, we began to feel exceedingly hungry. We had still
some biltong left but our stomachs turned from biltong, and, besides, we.
had to be very sparing of it, for we could not say when we should get more
food. Just at this moment a lucky thing happened. Looking towards the desert
I saw a flock of about ten large birds flying straight towards us.

<P>&nbsp;"Skit, Baas, skit!" (shoot, master, shoot), whispered the Hottentot,
throwing himself on his face, an example which we all followed.

<P>&nbsp;Then I saw that the birds were a flock of pauw (bustards), and
that they would pass within fifty yards of my head. Taking one of the repeating
Winchesters, I waited till they were nearly over us, and then jumped on
to my feet. On seeing me the pauw bunched up together, as I expected they
would, and I fired two shots straight into the thick of them, and, as luck
would have it, brought one down, a fine fellow, that weighed about twenty
pounds. In half an hour we had a fire made of dry melon-stalks, and he
was toasting over it, and we had such a feed as we had not had for a week.
We ate that pauw - nothing was left of him but his bones and his beak -
and felt not a little the better afterwards.

<P>&nbsp;That night we again went on with the moon, carrying as many melons
as we could with us. As we got higher up we found the air get cooler and
cooler, which was a great relief to us, and at dawn, so far as we could
judge, were not more than about a dozen miles from the snow-line. Here
we found more melons, so had no longer any anxiety about water, for we
knew that we should soon get plenty of snow. But the ascent had now become
very precipitous, and we made but slow progress, not more than a mile an
hour. Also that night we ate our last morsel of biltong. As yet, with the
exception of the pauw, we had seen no living thing on the mountain, nor
had we come across a single spring or stream of water, which struck us
as very odd, considering all the snow above us, which must, we thought,
melt sometimes. But as we afterwards discovered, owing to some cause, which
it is quite beyond my power to explain, all the streams flowed down upon
the north side of the mountains.

<P>&nbsp;We now began to grow very anxious about food. We had escaped death
by thirst, but it seemed probable that it was only to die of hunger. The
events of the next three miserable days are best described by copying the
entries made at the time in my note-book.

<P>&nbsp;21st May. Started 11 A.M, finding the atmosphere quite cold enough
to travel by day, carrying some watermelons with us. Struggled on all day,
but saw no more melons, having, evidently, passed out of their district.
Saw no game of any sort. Halted for the night at sundown, having had no
food for many hours. Suffered much during the night from cold.

<P>&nbsp;22d. - Started at sunrise again, feeling very faint and weak.
Only made five miles all day; found some patches of snow, of which we ate,
but nothing else. Camped at night under the edge of a great plateau. Cold
bitter. Drank a little brandy each, and huddled ourselves together, each
wrapped up in our blanket to keep ourselves alive. Are now suffering frightfully
from starvation and weariness. Thought that Ventv&ouml;gel would have died
during the night.

<P>&nbsp;23d. - -Struggled forward once more as soon as the sun was well
up, and had thawed our limbs a little. We are now in a dreadful plight,
and I fear that unless we get food this will be our last day's journey.
But little brandy left. Good, Sir Henry, and Umbopa bear up wonderfully,
but Ventv&ouml;gel is in a very bad way. Like most Hottentots, he cannot
stand cold. Pangs of hunger not so bad, but have a sort of numb feeling
about the stomach. Others say the same. We are now on a level with the
precipitous chain, or wall of lava, connecting the two breasts, and the
view is glorious. Behind us the great glowing desert rolls away to the
horizon, and before us lies mile upon mile of smooth, hard snow almost
level, but swelling gently upward, out of the centre of which the nipple
of the mountain, which appears to be some miles in circumference, rises
about four thousand feet into the sky. Not a living thing is to be seen.
God help us, I fear our time has come.

<P>&nbsp;And now I will drop the journal, partly because it is not very
interesting reading, and partly because what follows requires perhaps rather
more accurate telling.

<P>&nbsp;All that day (the 23d May) we struggled slowly on up the incline
of snow, lying down. from time to time to rest. A strange, gaunt crew we
must have looked, as, laden as we were, we dragged our weary feet over
the dazzling plain, glaring round us with hungry eyes. Not that there was
much use in glaring, for there was nothing to eat. We did not do more than
seven miles that day. Just before sunset we found ourselves right under
the nipple of Sheba's left breast, which towered up thousands of feet-into
the air above us, a vast, smooth hillock of frozen snow. Bad as we felt,
we could not but appreciate the wonderful scene, made even more wonderful
by the flying rays of light from the setting sun, which here and there
stained the snow blood red, and crowned the towering mass above us with
a diadem of glory.

<P>&nbsp;"I say," gasped Good, presently, "we ought to be somewhere near
the cave the old gentleman wrote about."

<P>&nbsp;"Yes," said I, "if there is a cave."

<P>&nbsp;"Come, Quatermain," groaned Sir Henry, "don't talk like that;
I have every faith in the don; remember the water. We shall find the place
soon."

<P>&nbsp;"If we don't find it before dark we are dead men, that is all
about it," was my consolatory reply.

<P>&nbsp;For the next ten minutes we trudged on in silence, when suddenly
Umbopa, who was marching along beside me, wrapped up in his blanket and
with a leather belt strapped so tight round his stomach, to "make his hunger
small," as he said, that his waist looked like a girl's, caught me by the
arm.

<P>&nbsp;"Look!" he said, pointing towards the springing slope of the nipple.

<P>&nbsp;I followed his glance, and perceived, some two hundred yards from
us, what appeared to be a hole in the snow.

<P>&nbsp;"It is the cave," said Umbopa.

<P>&nbsp;We made the best of our way to the spot, and found, sure enough,
that the hole was the mouth of a cave, no doubt the same as that of which
Da Silvestra wrote. We were none too soon, for just as we reached shelter
the sun went down with startling rapidity, leaving the whole place nearly
dark. In these latitudes there is but little twilight. We crept into the
cave, which did not appear to be very big, and, huddling ourselves together
for warmth, swallowed what remained of our brandy - barely a mouthful each
- -and tried to forget our miseries in sleep. But this the cold was too
intense to allow us to do. I am convinced that at that great altitude the
thermometer cannot have been less than fourteen or fifteen degrees below
freezing-point. What this meant to us, enervated as we were by hardship,
want of food, and the great heat of the desert, my reader can imagine better
than I can describe. Suffice it to say that it was something as near death
from exposure as I have ever felt. There we sat hour after hour through
the bitter night, feeling the frost wander round and nip us now in the
finger, now in the foot, and now in the face. In vain did we huddle up
closer and closer; there was no warmth in our miserable, starved carcasses.
Sometimes one of us would drop into an uneasy slumber for a few minutes,
but we could not sleep long, and perhaps it was fortunate, for I doubt
if we should ever have woke again. I believe it was only by force of will
that we kept ourselves alive at all.

<P>&nbsp;Not very long before dawn I heard the Hottentot Ventv&ouml;gel,
whose teeth had been chattering all night like castanets, give a deep sigh,
and then his teeth stopped chattering. I did not think anything of it at
the time, concluding that he had gone to sleep. His back was resting against
mine, and it seemed to grow colder, and colder, till at last it was like
ice.

<P>&nbsp;At length the air began to grow gray with light, then swift golden
arrows came flashing across the snow, and at last the glorious sun peeped
up above the lava wall and looked in upon our half-frozen forms and upon
Ventv&ouml;gel, sitting there among us stone dead. No wonder his back had
felt cold, poor fellow. He had died when I heard him sigh, and was now
almost frozen stiff. Shocked beyond measure, we dragged ourselves from
the corpse (strange the horror we all have of the companionship of a dead
body), and left it still sitting there, with its arms clasped round its
knees.

<P>&nbsp;By this time the sunlight was pouring its cold rays (for here
they were cold) straight in at the mouth of the cave. Suddenly I heard
an exclamation of fear from some one, and turned my head down the cave.

<P>&nbsp;And this was what I saw. Sitting at the end of it, for it was
not more than twenty feet long, was another form, of which the head rested
on the chest and the long arms hung down. I stared at it, and saw that
it, too, was a <I>dead man</I>, and what was more, a white man.

<P>&nbsp;The others saw it, too, and the sight proved too much for our
shattered nerves. One and all we scrambled out of the cave as fast as our
half-frozen limbs would allow.
