CHAPTER XX</H2>

<H3>
FOUND</H3>
AND now I come to perhaps the strangest thing that happened to us in all
that strange business, and one which shows how wonderfully things are brought
about.

<P>&nbsp;I was walking quietly along, some way in front of the other two,
down the banks of the stream which ran from the oasis till it was swallowed
up in the hungry desert sands, when suddenly I stopped and rubbed my eyes,
as well I might. There, not twenty yards in front, placed in a charming
situation, under the shade of a species of fig-tree, and facing to the
stream, was a cosey hut, built more or less on the Kaffir principle of
grass and withes, only with a full-length door instead of a bee-hole.

<P>&nbsp;"What the dickens," said I to myself, "can a hut be doing here?"
Even as I said it, the door of the hut opened, and there limped out of
it a <I>white man</I> clothed in skins, and with an enormous black beard.
I thought that I must have got a touch of the sun. It was impossible. No
hunter ever came to such a place as this. Certainly no hunter would ever
settle in it. I stared and stared, and so did the other man, and just at
that juncture Sir Henry and Good came up.

<P>&nbsp;"Look here, you fellows," I said, "is that a white man, or am
I mad?"

<P>&nbsp;Sir Henry looked, and Good looked, and then all of a sudden the
lame white man with the black beard gave a great cry, and came hobbling
towards us. When he got close he fell down in a sort of faint.

<P>&nbsp;With a spring Sir Henry was by his side.

<P>&nbsp;"Great Powers!" he cried, "<I>it is my brother George!</I>"

<P>&nbsp;At the sound of the disturbance another figure, also clad in skins,
emerged from the hut with a gun in his hand, and came running towards us.
On seeing me he too gave a cry.

<P>&nbsp;"Macumazahn," he hallooed, "don't you know me, Baas? I'm Jim,
the hunter. I lost the note you gave me to give to the Baas, and we have
been here nearly two years." And the fellow fell at my feet and rolled
over and over, weeping for joy.

<P>&nbsp;"You careless scoundrel!" I said; "you ought to be well hided."

<P>&nbsp;Meanwhile the man with the black beard had recovered and got up,
and he and Sir Henry were pump-handling away at each other, apparently
without a word to say. But whatever they had quarrelled about in the past
(I suspect it was a lady, though I never asked), it was evidently forgotten
now.

<P>&nbsp;"My dear old fellow," burst out Sir Henry at last, "I thought
that you were dead. I have been over Solomon's Mountains to find you, and
now I come across you perched in the desert, like an old Aasv&ouml;gel
(vulture)."

<P>&nbsp;"I tried to go over Solomon's Mountains nearly two years ago,"
was the answer, spoken in the hesitating voice of a man who has had little
recent opportunity of using his tongue, "but when I got here, a boulder
fell on my leg and crushed it, and I have been able to go neither forward
nor back."

<P>&nbsp;Then I came up. "How do you do, Mr. Neville?" I said; "do you
remember me?"

<P>&nbsp;"Why," he said, "isn't it Quatermain, eh, and Good, too? Hold
on a minute, you fellows, I am getting dizzy again. It is all so very strange,
and, when a man has ceased to hope, so very happy."

<P>&nbsp;That evening, over the camp-fire, George Curtis told us his story,
which, in its way, was almost as eventful as our own, and amounted, shortly,
to this. A little short of two years before, he had started from Sitanda's
Kraal, to try and reach the mountains. As for the note I had sent him by
Jim, that worthy had lost it, and he had never heard of it till to-day.
But, acting upon information he had received from the natives, he made,
not for Sheba's breasts, but for the ladder-like descent of the mountains
down which we had just come, which was clearly a better route than that
marked out in old Don Silvestra's plan. In the desert he and Jim suffered
great hardships, but finally they reached this oasis, where a terrible
accident befell George Curtis. On the day of their arrival he was sitting
by the stream, and Jim was extracting the honey from the nest of a stingless
bee, which is to be found in the desert, on the top of the bank immediately
above him. In so doing he loosed a great boulder of rock, which fell upon
George Curtis's right leg, crushing it frightfully. From that day he had
been so dreadfully lame that he had found it impossible to go either forward
or back, and had preferred to take the chances of dying on the oasis to
the certainty of perishing in the desert.

<P>&nbsp;As for food, however, they had got on pretty well, for they had
a good supply. of ammunition, and the oasis was frequented, especially
at night, by large quantities of game, which came thither for water. These
they shot, or trapped in pitfalls, using their flesh for food and, after
their clothes wore out, their hides for covering.

<P>&nbsp;"And so," he ended, "we have lived for nearly two years, like
a second Robinson Crusoe and his man Friday, hoping against hope that some
natives might come here and help us away, but none have come. Only last
night we settled that Jim should leave me and try to reach Sitanda's Kraal
and get assistance. He was to go to-morrow, but I had little hope of ever
seeing him back again. And now <I>you,</I> of all the people in the world,
<I>you</I> who I fancied had long ago forgotten all about me, and were
living comfortably in old England, turn up in a promiscuous way and find
me where you least expected. It is the most wonderful thing I ever heard
of, and the most merciful, too."

<P>&nbsp;Then Sir Henry set to work and told him the main facts of our
adventures, sitting till late into the night to do it.

<P>&nbsp;"By Jove!" he said, when I showed him some of the diamonds; "well,
at least you have got something for your pains, besides my worthless self."

<P>&nbsp;Sir Henry laughed. "They belong to Quatermain and Good. It was
part of the bargain that they should share any spoils there might be."

<P>&nbsp;This remark set me thinking, and, having spoken to Good, I told
Sir Henry that it was our unanimous wish that he should take a third share
of the diamonds, or, if he would not, that his share should be handed to
his brother, who had suffered even more than ourselves on the chance of
getting them. Finally, we prevailed upon him to consent to this arrangement,
but George Curtis did not know of it till some time afterwards.

And here, at this point, I think I shall end this history. Our journey
across the desert back to Sitanda's Kraal was most arduous, especially
as we had to support George Curtis, whose right leg was very weak indeed,
and continually throwing out splinters of bone; but we did accomplish it,
somehow, and to give its details would only be to reproduce much of what
happened to us on the former occasion.

<P>&nbsp;Six months from the date of our rearrival at Sitanda's, where
we found our guns and other goods quite safe, though the old scoundrel
in charge was much disgusted at our surviving to claim them, saw us all
once more safe and sound at my little place on the Berea, near Durban,
where I am now writing, and whence I bid farewell to all who have accompanied
me throughout the strangest trip I ever made in the course of a long and
varied experience.

<P>&nbsp;

<P>Just as I had written the last word a Kaffir came up my avenue of orange
trees, with a letter in a cleft stick, which he had brought from the post.
It turned out to be from Sir Henry, and, as it speaks for itself, I give
it in full.

<CENTER>"BRAYLEY HALL, YORKSHIRE.</CENTER>
"MY DEAR QUATERMAIN, -

<P>I sent you a line a few mails back to say that the three of us, George,
Good, and myself, fetched up all right in England. We got off the boat
at Southampton, and went up to town. You should have seen what a swell
Good turned out the very next day, beautifully shaved, frock coat fitting
like a glove, brand-new eyeglass, etc., etc. I went and walked in the park
with him, where I met some people I know, and at once told them the story
of his `beautiful white legs.'

<P>&nbsp;"He is furious, especially as some ill-natured person has printed
it in a society paper.

<P>&nbsp;"To come to business, Good and I took the diamonds to Streeter's
to be valued, as we arranged, and I am really afraid to tell you what they
put them at, it seems so enormous. They say that of course it is more or
less guess-work, as such stones have never to their knowledge been put
on the market in anything like such quantities. It appears that they are
(with the exception of one or two of the largest) of the finest water,
and equal in every way to the best Brazilian stones. I asked them if they
would buy them, but they said that it was beyond their power to do so,
and recommended us to sell by degrees, for fear we should flood the market.
They offer, however, a hundred and eighty thousand for a small portion
of them.

<P>&nbsp;"You must come home, Quatermain, and see about these things, especially
if you insist upon making the magnificent present of the third share, which
does <I>not</I> belong to me, to my brother George. As for Good, he is
<I>no good</I>. His time is too much occupied in shaving, and other matters
connected with the vain adorning of his body. But I think he is still down
on his luck about Foulata. He told me that since he had been home he hadn't
seen a woman to touch her, either as regards her figure or the sweetness
of her expression.

<P>&nbsp;"I want you to come home, my dear old comrade, and buy a place
near here. You have done your day's work, and have lots of money now, and
there is a place for sale quite close which would suit you admirably. Do
come; the sooner the better; you can finish writing the story of our adventures
on board ship. We have refused to tell the story till it is written by
you, for fear that we shall not be believed. If you start on receipt of
this you will reach here by Christmas, and I book you to stay with me for
that. Good is coming, and George, and so, by the way, is your boy Harry
(there's a bribe for you). I have had him down for a week's shooting and
like him. He is a cool young hand; he shot me in the leg, cut out the pellets,
and then remarked upon the advantage of having a medical student in every
shooting-party.

<P>&nbsp;"Good-bye, old boy; I can't say any more, but I know that you
will come, if it is only to oblige your sincere friend,

<P>&nbsp;
<CENTER>HENRY CURTIS.</CENTER>
"P.S. - The tusks of the great bull that killed poor Khiva have now been
put up in the hall here, over the pair of buffalo-horns you gave me, and
look magnificent; and the axe with which I chopped off Twala's head is
stuck up over my writing-table. I wish we could have managed to bring away
the coats of chain armor. H.C."</BLOCKQUOTE>
To-day is Tuesday. There is a steamer going on Friday, and I really think
I must take Curtis at his word, and sail by her for England, if it is only
to see my boy Harry and see about the printing of this history, which is
a task I do not like to trust to anybody else.
