<H3>
THE LEGEND OF SOLOMON'S MINES</H3>
"WHAT was it that you heard about my brother's journey at Bamangwato?"
said Sir Henry, as I paused to fill my pipe before answering Captain Good.

<P>&nbsp;"I heard this," I answered, "and I have never mentioned it to
a soul till to-day. I heard that he was starting for Solomon's Mines."

<P>&nbsp;"Solomon's Mines!" ejaculated both my hearers at once. "Where
are they?"

<P>&nbsp;"I don't know," I said; "I know where they are said to be. I once
saw the peaks of the mountains that border them, but there was a hundred
and thirty miles of desert between me and them, and I am not aware that
any white man ever got across it, save one. But perhaps the best thing
I can do is to tell you the legend of Solomon's Mines as I know it, you
passing your word not to reveal anything I tell you without my permission.
Do you agree to that? I have my reasons for asking it."

<P>&nbsp;Sir Henry nodded, and Captain Good replied, "Certainly, certainly."

<P>&nbsp;"Well," I began, "as you may guess, in a general way elephant-hunters
are a rough set of men, and don't trouble themselves with much beyond the
facts of life and the ways of Kaffirs. But here and there you meet a man
who takes the trouble to collect traditions from the natives, and tries
to make out a little piece of the history of this dark land. It was such
a man as this who first told me the legend of Solomon's Mines, now a matter
of nearly thirty years ago. It was when I was on my first elephant hunt
in the Matabele country. His name was Evans, and he was killed next year,
poor fellow, by a wounded buffalo, and lies buried near the Zambesi Falls.
I was telling Evans one night, I remember, of some wonderful workings I
had found while hunting koodoo and eland in what is now the Lydenburg district
of the Transvaal. I see they have come across these workings again lately
in prospecting for gold, but I knew of them years ago. There is a great
wide wagon-road cut out of the solid rock, and leading to the mouth of
the working or gallery. Inside the mouth of this gallery are stacks of
gold quartz piled up ready for crushing, which shows that the workers,
whoever they were, must have left in a hurry, and about twenty paces in
the gallery is built across, and a beautiful bit of masonry it is.

<P>&nbsp;"'Ay,' said Evans, `but I will tell you a queerer thing than that;'
and he went on to tell me how he had found in the far interior a ruined
city, which he believed to be the Ophir of the Bible - and, by the way,
other more learned men have said the same long since poor Evans's time.
I was, I remember, listening open-eared to all these wonders, for I was
young at the time, and this story of an ancient civilization, and of the
treasure which those old Jewish or Phoenician adventurers used to extract
from a country long since lapsed into the darkest barbarism, took a great
hold upon my imagination, when suddenly he said to me, `Lad, did you ever
hear of the Suliman Mountains up to the northwest of the Mashukulumbwe
country?' I told him I never had. `Ah, well,' he said, `that was where
Solomon really had his mines - his diamond mines, I mean.'

<P>&nbsp;"'How do you know that?' I asked.

<P>&nbsp;"'Know it? why, what is "Suliman" but a corruption of Solomon?
and, besides, an old Isanusi (witch doctor) up in the Manica country told
me all about it. She said that the people who lived across those mountains
were a branch of the Zulus, speaking a dialect of Zulu, but finer and bigger
men even; that there lived among them great wizards, who had learned their
art from white men when "all the world was dark," and who had the secret
of a wonderful mine of "bright stones."'

<P>&nbsp;"Well, I laughed at this story at the time, though it interested
me, for the diamond fields were not discovered then, and poor Evans went
off and got killed, and for twenty years I never thought any more of the
matter. But just twenty years afterwards - and that is a long time, gentlemen;
an elephant-hunter does not often live for twenty years at his business
- I heard something more definite about Suliman's Mountains and the country
which lies beyond them. I was up beyond the Manica country at a place called
Sitanda's Kraal, and a miserable place it was, for one could get nothing
to eat there, and there was but little game about. I had an attack of fever,
and was in a bad way generally, when one day a Portugee arrived with a
single companion - a half-breed. Now I know your Delagoa Portugee well.
There is no greater devil unhung, in a general way, battening as he does
upon human agony and flesh in the shape of slaves. But this was quite a
different type of man to the low fellows I had been accustomed to meet;
he reminded me more of the polite dons I have read about. He was tall and
thin, with large dark eyes and curling gray mustache. We talked together
a little, for he could speak broken English, and I understood a little
Portugee, and he told me that his name was Jos&eacute; Silvestre, and that
he had a place near Delagoa Bay; and when he went on next day, with his
half-breed companion, he said, `Good-bye,' taking off his hat quite in
the old style. `Good-bye, senor,' he said; `if ever we meet again I shall
be the richest man in the world, and I will remember you.' I laughed a
little - I was too weak to laugh much - and watched him strike out for
the great desert to the west, wondering if he was mad, or what he thought
he was going to find there.

<P>&nbsp;"A week passed, and I got the better of my fever. One evening
I was sitting on the ground in front of the little tent I had with me,
chewing the last leg of a miserable fowl I had bought from a native for
a bit of cloth worth twenty fowls, and staring at the hot, red sun sinking
down into the desert, when suddenly I saw a figure, apparently that of
a European, for it wore a coat, on the slope of the rising ground opposite
to me, about three hundred yards away. The figure crept along on its hands
and knees, then it got up and staggered along a few yards on its legs,
only to fall and crawl along again. Seeing that it must be somebody in
distress, I sent one of my hunters to help him, and presently he arrived,
and who do you suppose it turned out to be?"

<P>&nbsp;"Jos&eacute; Silvestre, of course," said Captain Good.

<P>&nbsp;"Yes, Jos&eacute; Silvestre, or rather his skeleton and a little
skin. His face was bright yellow With bilious fever, and his large, dark
eyes stood nearly out of his head, for all his flesh had gone. There was
nothing but yellow, parchment-like skin, white hair, and the gaunt bones
sticking up beneath.

<P>&nbsp;"'Water! for the sake of Christ, water!' he moaned. I saw that
his lips were cracked, and his tongue, which protruded between them, was
swollen and blackish.

<P>&nbsp;"I gave him water with a little milk in it, and he drank it in
great gulps, two quarts or more, without stopping. I would not let him
have any more. Then the fever took him again, and he fell down and began
to rave about Suliman's Mountains, and the diamonds, and the desert. I
took him into the tent and did what I could for him, which was little enough;
but I saw how it must end. About eleven o'clock he got quieter, and I lay
down for a little rest and went to sleep. At dawn I woke again, and saw
him in the half light sitting up, a strange, gaunt form, and gazing out
towards the desert. Presently the first ray of the sun shot right across
the wide plain before us till it reached the faraway crest of one of the
tallest of the Suliman Mountains, more than a hundred miles away.

<P>&nbsp;"'There it is" cried the dying man in Portuguese, stretching out
his long, thin arm, `but I shall never reach it, never. No one will ever
reach it!'

<P>&nbsp;"Suddenly he paused, and seemed to take a resolution. `Friend,'
he said, turning towards me, `are you there? My eyes grow dark.'

<P>&nbsp;"Yes," I said, "yes, lie down now, and rest."

<P>&nbsp;"'Ay,' he answered, `I shall rest soon; I have time to rest-all
eternity. Listen, I am dying! You have been good to me. I will give you
the paper. Perhaps you will get there if you can live through the desert,
which has killed my poor servant and me.'

<P>&nbsp;"Then he groped in his shirt and brought out what I thought was
a Boer tobacco-pouch of the skin of the Swartvet-pens (sable antelope).
It was fastened with a little strip of hide, what we call a rimpi, and
this he tried to untie, but could not. He handed it to me. `Untie it,'
he said. I did so, and extracted a bit of torn yellow linen, on which something
was written in rusty letters. Inside was a paper.

<P>&nbsp;"Then he went on feebly, for he was growing weak: `The paper has
it all, that is on the rag. It took me years to read. Listen: my ancestor,
a political refugee from Lisbon and one of the first Portuguese who landed
on these shores, wrote that when he was dying on those mountains which
no white foot ever pressed before or since. His name was Jos&eacute; da
Silvestra, and he lived three hundred years ago. His slave, who waited
for him on this side the mountains, found him dead, and brought the writing
home to Delagoa. It has been in the family ever since, but none have cared
to read it till at last I did. And I have lost my life over it, but another
may succeed, and become the richest man in the world - the richest man
in the world. Only give it to no one; go yourself!' Then he began to wander
again, and in an hour it was all over.

<P>&nbsp;"God rest him! he died very quietly, and I buried him deep, with
big boulders on his breast; so I do not think that the jackals can have
dug him up. And then I came away."

<P>&nbsp;"Ay, but the document," said Sir Henry, in a tone of deep interest.

<P>&nbsp;"Yes, the document; What was in it?" added the captain.

<P>&nbsp;"Well, gentlemen, if you like I will tell you. I have never showed
it to anybody yet except my dear wife, who is dead, and she thought it
was all nonsense, and a drunken old Portuguese trader who translated it
for me, and had forgotten all about it next morning. The original rag is
at my home in Durban, together with poor Don Jos&eacute;s translation,
but I have the English rendering in my pocketbook, and a facsimile of the
map, if it can be called a map. Here it is."

<P>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE>"I, Jos&eacute; da Silvestra, who am now dying of hunger in
the little cave where no snow is on the north side of the nipple of the
southernmost of the two mountains I have named Sheba's Breasts, write this
in the year 1590 with a cleft bone upon a remnant of my raiment, my blood
being the ink. If my slave should find it when he comes, and should bring
it to Delagoa, let my friend (name illegible) bring the matter to the knowledge
of the king, that he may send an army which, if they live through the desert
and the mountains, and can overcome the brave Kukuanes and their devilish
arts, to which end many priests should be brought, will make him the richest
king since Solomon. With my own eyes have I seen the countless diamonds
stored in Solomon's treasure chamber behind the white Death; but through
the treachery of Gagool the witch-finder I might bring nought away; scarcely
my life. Let him who comes follow the map, and climb the snow of Sheba's
left breast till he comes to the nipple, on the north side of which is
the great road Solomon made, from whence three days' journey to the King's
Place. Let him kill Gagool. Pray for my soul. Farewell.

<P>&nbsp;Jos&eacute; DA SILVESTRA."</BLOCKQUOTE>
When I had finished reading the above and shown the copy of the map, drawn
by the dying hand of the old don with his blood for ink, there followed
a silence of astonishment.

<P>&nbsp;"Well," said Captain Good, "I have been round the world twice,
and put in at most ports, but may I be hung if I ever heard a yarn like
that out of a story-book, or in it either, for the matter of that."

<P>&nbsp;"It's a queer story, Mr. Quatermain," said Sir Henry. "I suppose
you are not hoaxing us? It is, I how, sometimes thought allowable to take
a greenhorn in."

<P>&nbsp;"If you think that, Sir Henry," I said, much put out, and pocketing
my paper, for I do not like to be thought one of those silly fellows who
consider it witty to tell lies, and who are forever boasting to new-comers
of extraordinary hunting adventures which never happened, "why there is
an end of the matter," and I rose to go.

<P>&nbsp;Sir Henry laid his large hand upon my shoulder. "Sit down, Mr.
Quatermain," he said, "I beg your pardon; I see very well you do not wish
to deceive us, but the story sounded so extraordinary that I could hardly
believe it."

<P>&nbsp;"You shall see the original map and writing when we reach Durban,"
I said, somewhat mollified; for really, when I came to consider, the matter,
it was scarcely wonderful that he should doubt my good faith. "But I have
not told you about your brother. I knew the man Jim who was with him. He
was a Bechuana by birth, a good hunter, and, for a native, a very clever
man. The morning Mr. Neville was starting, I saw Jim standing by my wagon
and cutting up tobacco on the disselboom.

<P>&nbsp;"'Jim,' said I, `where are you off to this trip? Is it elephants?'

<P>&nbsp;"'No, Baas,' he answered, `we are after something worth more than
ivory.'

<P>&nbsp;"'And what might that be?' I said; for I was curious. `Is it gold?'

<P>&nbsp;"'No, Baas, something worth more than gold,' and he grinned.

<P>&nbsp;"I did not ask any more questions, for I did not like to lower
my dignity by seeming curious, but I was puzzled. Presently Jim finished
cutting his tobacco.

<P>&nbsp;"'Baas,' said he.

<P>&nbsp;"I took no notice.

<P>&nbsp;"'Baas,' said he again.

<P>&nbsp;"'Eh, boy, what is it?' said I.

<P>&nbsp;"'Baas, we are going after diamonds.'

<P>&nbsp;"'Diamonds! why, then, you are going in the wrong direction; you
should head for the Fields.'

<P>&nbsp;"'Baas, have you ever heard of Suliman's Berg?' (Solomon's Mountains.)

<P>&nbsp;"'Have you ever heard of the diamonds there?'

<P>&nbsp;"'I have heard a foolish story, Jim.'

<P>&nbsp;"'It is no story, Baas. I once knew a woman who came from there,
and got to Natal with her child. She told me; she is dead now.'

<P>&nbsp;"'Your master will feed the assvogels (vultures), Jim, if he tries
to reach Suliman's country; and so will you, if they can get any pickings
off your worthless old carcass,' said I.

<P>&nbsp;"He grinned. `Mayhap, Baas. Man must die; I'd rather like to try
a new country myself; the elephants are getting worked out about here.'

<P>&nbsp;"'Ah! my boy,' I said, `you wait till the "pale old man" (death)
gets a grip of your yellow throat, and then we'll hear what sort of a tune
you sing.'

<P>&nbsp;"Half an hour after that I saw Neville's wagon move off. Presently
Jim came running back. `Good-bye, Baas,' he said. `I didn't like to start
without bidding you good-bye, for I dare say you are right, and we shall
never come back again.'

<P>&nbsp;"'Is your master really going to Suliman's Berg, Jim, or are you
lying?'

<P>&nbsp;"'No,' says he; `he is going. He told me he was bound to make
his fortune somehow, or try to; so he might as well try the diamonds.'

<P>&nbsp;"'Oh!' said I; `wait a bit, Jim; will you take a note to your
master, Jim, and promise not to give it to him until you reach Inyati?'
(which was some hundred miles off).

<P>&nbsp;"'Yes,' said he.

<P>&nbsp;"So I took a scrap of paper and wrote on it, `Let him who comes
climb the snow of Sheba's left breast, till he comes to the nipple, on
the north side of which is Solomon's great road.'

<P>&nbsp;"'Now, Jim,' I said, `when you give this to your master, tell
him he had better follow the advice implicitly. You are not to give it
to him now, because I don't want him back asking me questions which I won't
answer. Now be off, you idle fellow, the wagon is nearly out of sight.'

<P>&nbsp;"Jim took the note and went, and that is all I know about your
brother, Sir Henry; but I am much afraid - "

<P>&nbsp;"Mr. Quatermain," said Sir Henry, "I am going to look for my brother;
I am going to trace him to Suliman's Mountains, and over them, if necessary,
until I find him, or until I know that he is dead. Will you come with me?"

<P>&nbsp;I am, as I think I have said, a cautious man, indeed a timid one,
and I shrank from such an idea. It seemed to me that to start on such a
journey would be to go to certain death, and, putting other things aside,
as I had a son to support, I could not afford to die just then.

<P>&nbsp;"No, thank you, Sir Henry, I think I had rather not," I answered.
"I am too old for wild-goose chases of that sort, and we should only end
up like my poor friend Silvestre. I have a son dependent on me, so cannot
afford to risk my life."

<P>&nbsp;Both Sir Henry and Captain Good looked very disappointed.

<P>&nbsp;"Mr. Quatermain," said the former, "I am well off, and I am bent
upon this business You may put the remuneration for your services at whatever
figure you like, in reason, and it shall be paid over to you before we
start. Moreover, I will, before we start, arrange that in the event of
anything happening to us or to you, your son shall be suitably provided
for. You will see from this how necessary I think your presence. Also,
if by any chance we should reach this place, and find diamonds, they shall
belong to you and Good equally. I do not want them. But of course the chance
is as good as nothing, though the same thing would apply to any ivory we
might get. You may pretty well make your own terms with me, Mr. Quatermain;
of course I shall pay all expenses."

<P>&nbsp;"Sir Henry," said I, "this is the most liberal offer I ever had,
and one not to be sneezed at by a poor hunter and trader. But the job is
the biggest I ever came across, and I must take time to think it over.
I will give you my answer before we get to Durban."

<P>&nbsp;"Very good," answered Sir Henry, and then I said good-night and
turned in, and dreamed about poor, long-dead Silvestre and the diamonds.
