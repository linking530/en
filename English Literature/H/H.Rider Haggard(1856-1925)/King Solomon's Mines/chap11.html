CHAPTER XI</H2>

<H3>
WE GIVE A SIGN</H3>
FOR a long while - two hours, I should think - we sat there in silence,
for we were too overwhelmed by the recollection of the horrors we had seen
to talk. At last, just as we were thinking of turning in - for already
there were faint streaks of light in the eastern sky - we heard the sound
of steps. Then came the challenge of the sentry who was posted at the kraal
gate, which was apparently answered, though not in an audible tone, for
the steps came on; and in another second Infadoos had entered the hut,
followed by some half a dozen stately looking chiefs.

<P>&nbsp;"My lords," he said, "I have come, according to my word. My lords
and Ignosi, rightful king of the Kukuanas, I have brought with me these
men," pointing to the row of chiefs, "who are great men among us, having
each one of them the command of three thousand soldiers, who live but to
do their bidding, under the king's. I have told them of what I have seen,
and what my ears have heard. Now let them also see the sacred snake around
thee, and hear thy story, Ignosi, that they may say whether or no they
will make cause with thee against Twala the king."

<P>&nbsp;For answer, Ignosi again stripped off his girdle and exhibited
the snake tattooed around him. Each chief in turn drew near and examined
it by the dim light of the lamp, and without saying a word passed on to
the other side.

<P>&nbsp;Then Ignosi resumed his moocha and, addressing them, repeated
the history he had detailed in the morning.

<P>&nbsp;"Now ye have heard, chiefs," said Infadoos, when he had done,
"what say ye; will ye stand by this man and help him to his father's throne,
or will ye not? The land cries out against Twala, and the blood of the
people flows like the waters in spring. Ye have seen tonight. Two other
chiefs there were with whom I had it in my mind to speak, and where are
they now? The hyenas howl over their corpses. Soon will ye be as they are
if ye strike not. Choose, then, my brothers."

<P>&nbsp;The eldest of the six men, a short, thick-set warrior, with white
hair, stepped forward a pace and answered,

<P>&nbsp;"Thy words are true, Infadoos; the land cries out. "My own brother
is among those who died to-night; but this is a great matter, and the thing
is hard to believe. How know we that if we lift our spears it may not be
for an impostor? It is a great matter, I say, and none may see the end
of it. For of this be sure, blood will flow in rivers before the deed is
done; many will still cleave to the king, for men worship the sun that
still shines bright in the heavens, and not that which has not risen. These
white men from the stars, their magic is great, and Ignosi is under the
cover of their wing. If he be indeed the rightful king, let them give us
a sign, and let the people have a sign, that all may see. So shall men
cleave to us, knowing that the white man's magic is with them."

<P>&nbsp;"Ye have the sign of the snake," I answered.

<P>&nbsp;"My lord, it is not enough. The snake may have been placed there
since the man's birth. Show us a sign. We will not move without a sign."
The others gave a decided assent, and I turned in perplexity to Sir Henry
and Good, and explained the situation.

<P>&nbsp;"I think I have it," said Good, exultingly; "ask them to give
us a moment to think." I did so, and the chiefs withdrew. As soon as they
were gone, Good went to the little box in which his medicines were, unlocked
it, and took out a note book, in the front of which was an almanac. "Now,
look here, you fellows, isn't to-morrow the fourth of June?" We had kept
a careful note of the days, so were able to answer that it was. "Very good;
then here we have it `4 June, total eclipse of the sun commences at 11.15
Greenwich time, visible in these islands, Africa, etc.' There's a sign
for you. Tell them that you will darken the sun to-morrow."

<P>&nbsp;The idea was a splendid one; indeed, the only fear about it was
a fear lest Good's almanac might be incorrect. If we made a false prophecy
on such a subject, our prestige would be gone forever, and so would Ignosi's
chance of the throne of the Kukuanas.

<P>&nbsp;"Suppose the almanac is wrong?" suggested Sir Henry to Good, who
was busily employed in working out something on the fly-leaf of the book.

<P>&nbsp;"I don't see any reason to suppose anything of the sort," was
his answer. "Eclipses always come up to time; at least, that is my experience
of them, and it especially states that it will be visible in Africa. I
have worked out the reckonings as well as I can without knowing our exact
position; and I make out that the eclipse should begin here about one o'clock
to-morrow, and last till half-past two. For half an hour or more there
should be total darkness."

<P>&nbsp;"Well," said Sir Henry, "I suppose we had better risk it."

<P>&nbsp;I acquiesced, though doubtfully, for eclipses are queer cattle
to deal with, and sent Umbopa to summon the chiefs back. Presently they
came, and I addressed them thus:

<P>&nbsp;"Great men of the Kukuanas, and thou, Infadoos, listen. We are
not fond of showing our powers, since to do so is to interfere with the
course of nature, and plunge the world into fear and confusion; but as
this matter is a great one, and as we are angered against the king because
of the slaughter we have seen, and because of the act of the Isanusi Gagool,
who would have put our friend Ignosi to death, we have determined to do
so, and to give such a sign as all men may see. Come thither," and I led
them to the door of the hut and pointed to the fiery ball of the rising
sun; "what see ye there?"

<P>&nbsp;"We see the rising sun," answered the spokesman of the party.

<P>&nbsp;"It is so. Now tell me, can any mortal man put out that sun, so
that night comes down on the land at midday?"

<P>&nbsp;The chief laughed a little. "No, my lord, that no man can do.
The sun is stronger than man who looks on him."

<P>&nbsp;"Ye say so. Yet I tell you that this day, one hour after midday,
will we put out that sun for a space of an hour, and darkness shall cover
the earth, and it shall be for a sign that we are indeed men of honor,
and that Ignosi is indeed king of the Kukuanas. If we do this thing will
it satisfy ye?"

<P>&nbsp;"Yea, my lords," answered the old chief with a smile, which was
reflected on the faces of his companions; "<I>if</I> ye do this thing we
will be satisfied indeed."

<P>&nbsp;"It shall be done: we three, Incubu the Elephant, Bougwan the
clear-eyed, and Macumazahn, who watches in the night, have said it, and
it shall be done. Dost thou hear, Infadoos?"

<P>&nbsp;"I hear, my lord, but it is a wonderful thing that ye promise,
to put out the sun, the father of all things, who shines forever."

<P>&nbsp;"Yet shall we do it, Infadoos."

<P>&nbsp;"It is well, my lords. To-day, a little after midday, will Twala
send for my lords to witness the girls dance, and one hour after the dance
begins shall the girl whom Twala thinks the fairest be killed by Scragga,
the king's son, as a sacrifice to the silent stone ones, who sit and keep
watch by the mountains yonder," and he pointed to the three strange looking
peaks where Solomon's Road was supposed to end. "Then let my lords darken
the sun, and save the maiden's life and the people will indeed believe."

<P>&nbsp;"Ay," said the old chief, still smiling a little, "the. people
will believe, indeed."

<P>&nbsp;"Two miles from Loo," went on Infadoos, "there is a hill curved
like the new moon, a stronghold, where my regiment, and three other regiments
which these men command, are stationed. This morning we will make a plan
whereby other regiments, two or three, may be moved there also. Then, if
my lords can indeed. darken the sun, in the darkness I will take my lords
by the hand and lead them out of Loo to this place, where they shall be
safe, and thence can we make war upon Twala, the king."

<P>&nbsp;"It is good," said I. "Now leave us to sleep awhile and make ready
our magic."

<P>&nbsp;Infadoos rose, and, having saluted us, departed with the chiefs.

<P>&nbsp;"My friends," said Ignosi, as soon as they were gone, "can ye
indeed do this wonderful thing, or were ye speaking empty words to the
men?"

<P>&nbsp;"We believe that we can do it, Umbopa - Ignosi, I mean."

<P>&nbsp;"It is strange;" he answered, "and had ye not been Englishmen
I would not have believed it; but English `gentlemen' tell no lies. If
we live through the matter, be sure I will repay ye!"

<P>&nbsp;"Ignosi," said Sir Henry, "promise me one thing."

<P>&nbsp;"I will promise, Incubu, my friend, even before I hear it," answered
the big man with a smile. "What is it?"

<P>&nbsp;"This: that if you ever come to be king of this people you will
do away with the smelling out of witches such as we have seen last night;
and that the killing of men without trial shall not take place in the land."

<P>&nbsp;Ignosi thought for a moment, after I had translated this, and
then answered:

<P>&nbsp;"The ways of black people are not as the ways of white men, Incubu,
nor do we hold life so high as ye. Yet will I promise it. If it be in my
power to hold them back, the witch-finders shall hunt no more, nor shall
any more die the death without judgment.''

<P>&nbsp;"That's a bargain, then," said Sir Henry; "and now let us get
a little rest."

<P>&nbsp;Thoroughly wearied out; we were soon sound asleep, and slept till
Ignosi woke us about eleven o'clock. Then we got up, washed, and ate a
hearty breakfast, not knowing when we should get any more food. After that
we went outside the hut and stared at the sun, which we were distressed
to observe presented a remarkably healthy appearance, without a sign of
an eclipse anywhere about it.

<P>&nbsp;"I hope it will come off," said Sir Henry, doubtfully. "False
prophets often find themselves in painful positions."

<P>&nbsp;"If it does not, it will soon be up with us," I answered, mournfully;
"for so sure as we are living men, some of those chiefs will tell the whole
story to the king, and then there will be another sort of eclipse, and
one that we shall not like."

<P>&nbsp;Returning to the hut, we dressed ourselves, putting on the mail
shirts which the king had sent us as before. Scarcely had we done so when
a messenger came from Twala to bid us to the great annual "dance of girls"
which was about to be celebrated.

<P>&nbsp;Taking our rifles and ammunition with us so as to have them handy
in case we had to fly, as suggested by Infadoos, we started boldly enough,
though with inward fear and trembling. The great space in front of the
king's kraal presented a very different appearance from what it had done
on the previous evening. In the place of the grim ranks of serried warriors
were company after company of Kukuana girls, not overdressed, so far as
clothing went, but each crowned with a wreath of flowers, and holding a
palm leaf in one hand and a tall white lily (the arum) in the other. In
the centre of the open space sat Twala, the king, with old Gagool at his
feet, attended by Infadoos, the boy Scragga, and about a dozen guards.
There were also present about a score of chiefs, among whom I recognized
most of our friends of the night before.

<P>&nbsp;Twala greeted us with much apparent cordiality, though I saw him
fix his one eye viciously on Umbopa.

<P>&nbsp;"Welcome, white men from the stars," he said; "this is a different
sight from what your eyes gazed on by the light of last night's moon, but
it is not so good a sight. Girls are pleasant, and were it not for such
as these" (and he pointed round him) "we should none of us be here to-day;
but men are better. Kisses and the tender words of women are sweet, but
the sound of the clashing of men's spears, and the smell of men's blood,
are sweeter far! Would ye have wives from among our people, white men?
If so, choose the fairest here, and ye shall have them, as many as ye will;"
and he paused for an answer.

<P>&nbsp;As the prospect did not seem to be without attractions to Good,
who was, like most sailors, of a susceptible nature, I, being elderly and
wise, and foreseeing the endless complications that anything of the sort
would involve (for women bring trouble as surely as the night follows the
day), put in a hasty answer:

<P>&nbsp;"Thanks, O king, but we white men wed only with white women like
ourselves. Your maidens are fair, but they are not for us!"

<P>&nbsp;The king laughed. "It is well. In our land there is a proverb
which says, `Woman's eyes are always bright, whatever the color,' and another
which says, `Love her who is present, for be sure she who is absent is
false to thee;' but perhaps these things are not so in the stars. In a
land where men are white all things are possible. So be it, white men;
the girls will not go begging! Welcome again; and welcome, too, thou black
one; if Gagool here had had her way thou wouldst have been stiff and cold
now. It is lucky that thou, too, camest from the stars; ha! ha!"

<P>&nbsp;"I can kill thee before thou killest me, O king," was Ignosi's
calm answer, "and thou shalt be stiff before my limbs cease to bend."

<P>&nbsp;Twala started. "Thou speakest boldly, boy," he replied, angrily;
"presume not too far."

<P>&nbsp;"He may well be bold in whose lips are truth. The truth is a sharp
spear which flies home and fails not. It is a message from `the stars,'
O king!"

<P>&nbsp;Twala scowled, and his one eye gleamed fiercely, but he said nothing
more.

<P>&nbsp;"Let the dance begin," he cried, and next second the flower-crowned
girls sprang forward in companies, singing a sweet song and waving the
delicate palms and white flowers. On they danced, now whirling round and
round, now meeting in mimic warfare, swaying, eddying here and there, coming
forward, falling back in an ordered confusion delightful to witness. At
last they paused, and a beautiful young woman sprang out of the ranks and
began to pirouette in front of us with a grace and vigor which would have
put most ballet-girls to shame. At length she fell back exhausted, and
another took her place, then another and another, but none of them, either
in grace, skill, or personal attractions, came up to the first.

<P>&nbsp;At length the king lifted his hand.

<P>&nbsp;"Which think ye the fairest, white men?" he asked.

<P>&nbsp;"The first," said I, unthinkingly. Next second I regretted it,
for I remembered that Infadoos had said that the fairest woman was offered
as a sacrifice.

<P>&nbsp;"Then is my mind as your minds, and my eyes as your eyes. She
is the fairest; and a sorry thing it is for her, for she must die!"

<P>&nbsp;"<I>Ay, must die!</I>" piped out Gagool, casting a glance from
her quick eyes in the direction of the poor girl, who, as yet ignorant
of the awful fate in store for her, was standing some twenty yards off
in front of a company of girls, engaged in nervously picking a flower from
her wreath to pieces, petal by petal.

<P>&nbsp;"Why, O king?" said I, restraining my indignation with difficulty;
"the girl has danced well and pleased us; she is fair, too; it would be
hard to reward her with death."

<P>&nbsp;Twala laughed as he answered:

<P>&nbsp;"It is our custom, and the figures who sit in stone yonder" (and
he pointed towards the three distant peaks) "must have their due. Did I
fail to put the fairest girl to death to-day misfortune would fall upon
me and my house. Thus runs the prophecy of my people: `If the king offer
not a sacrifice of a fair girl on the day of the dance of maidens to the
old ones who sit and watch on the mountains, then shall he fall and his
house.' Look ye, white men, my brother who reigned before me offered not
the sacrifice, because of the tears of the woman, and he fell, and his
house, and I reign in his stead. It is finished; she must die!" Then, turning
to the guards - "Bring her hither; Scragga, make sharp thy spear."

<P>&nbsp;Two of the men stepped forward, and as they did so the girl, for
the first time realizing her impending fate, screamed aloud and turned
to fly. But the strong hands caught her fist, and brought her, struggling
and weeping, up before us.

<P>&nbsp;"What is thy name, girl?" piped Gagool. "What! wilt thou not answer;
shall the king's son do his work at once?"

<P>&nbsp;At this hint, Scragga, looking more evil than ever, advanced a
step and lifted his great spear, and as he did so I saw Good's hand creep
to his revolver. The poor girl caught the glint of the cold steel through
her tears, and it sobered her anguish. She ceased struggling, but merely
clasped her hands convulsively, and stood shuddering from head to foot.

<P>&nbsp;"See," cried Scragga, in high glee, "she shrinks from the sight
of my little plaything even before she has tasted it," and he tapped the
broad blade of the spear.

<P>&nbsp;"If I ever get the chance, you shall pay for that, you young hound!"
I heard Good mutter beneath his breath.

<P>&nbsp;"Now that thou art quiet, give us thy name, my dear. Come, speak
up, and fear not," said Gagool in mockery.

<P>&nbsp;"Oh, mother," answered the girl in trembling accents, "my name
is Foulata, of the house of Suko. Oh, mother, why must I die? I have done
no wrong!"

<P>&nbsp;"Be comforted," went on the old woman, in her hateful tone of
mockery. "Thou must die, indeed, as a sacrifice to the old ones who sit
yonder" (and she pointed to the peaks); "but it is better to sleep in the
night than to toil in the day-time; it is better to die than to live, and
thou shalt die by the royal hand of the king's own son."

<P>&nbsp;The girl Foulata wrung her hands in anguish, and cried out aloud:
"Oh, cruel; and I so young! What have I done that I should never again
see the sun rise out of the night, or the stars come following on his track
in the evening: that I should no more gather the flowers when the dew is
heavy, or listen to the laughing of the waters! Woe is me, that I shall
never see my father's hut again, nor feel my mother's kiss, nor tend the
kid that is sick! Woe is me, that no lover shall put his arm around me
and look into my eyes, nor shall men-children be born of me! Oh, cruel,
cruel!" and again she wrung her hands and turned her tear-stained, flower
crowned face to heaven, looking so lovely in her despair - for she was
indeed a beautiful woman - that it would assuredly have melted the hears
of any one less cruel than the three fiends before us. Prince Arthur's
appeal to the ruffians who came to blind him was not more touching than
this savage girl's.

<P>&nbsp;But it did not move Gagool or Gagool's master, though I saw signs
of pity among the guard behind and on the faces of the chiefs; and as for
Good, he gave a sort of snort of indignation, anal made a motion as though
to go to her. With all a woman's quickness, the doomed girl interpreted
what was passing in his mind, and with a sudden movement flung herself
before him, and clasped his "beautiful white legs" with her hands.

<P>&nbsp;"Oh, white father from the stars!" she cried, "throw over me the
mantle of thy protection; let me creep into the shadow of thy strength,
that I may be saved. Oh, keep me from these cruel men and from the mercies
of Gagool!"

<P>&nbsp;"All right, my hearty, I'll look after you," sang out Good, in
nervous Saxon. "Come, get up, there's a good girl," and he stooped and
caught her hand.

<P>&nbsp;Twala turned and motioned to his son, who advanced with his spear
lifted.

<P>&nbsp;"Now's your time," whispered Sir Henry to me; "what are you waiting
for?"

<P>&nbsp;"I am waiting for the eclipse," I answered; "I have had my eye
on the sun for the last half-hour, and I never saw it look healthier."

<P>&nbsp;"Well, you must risk it now or the girl will be killed. Twala
is losing patience."

<P>&nbsp;Recognizing the force of the argument, having cast one more despairing
look at the bright face of the sun, for never did the most ardent astronomer
with a theory to prove await a celestial event with such anxiety, I stepped,
with all the dignity I could command, between the prostrate girl and the
advancing spear of Scragga.

<P>&nbsp;"King," I said; "this shall not be; we will not tolerate such
a thing; let the girl go in safety."

<P>&nbsp;Twala rose from his seat in his wrath and astonishment, and from
the chiefs and serried ranks of girls, who had slowly closed in upon us
in anticipation of the tragedy, came a murmur of amazement.

<P>&nbsp;"<I>Shall not be,</I> thou white dog, who yaps at the lion in
his cave; <I>shall not be!</I> Art thou mad? Be careful lest this chicken's
fate overtake thee and those with thee. How canst thou prevent it? Who
art thou, that thou standest between me and my will? Withdraw, I say. Scragga,
kill her. Ho, guards! seize these men."

<P>&nbsp;At his cry armed men came running swiftly from behind the hut,
where they had evidently been placed beforehand.

<P>&nbsp;Sir Henry, Good, and Umbopa ranged themselves alongside of me
and lifted their rifles.

<P>&nbsp;"Stop!" I shouted, boldly, though at the moment my heart was in
my boots. "Stop! we, the white men from the stars, say that it shall not
be. Come but one pace nearer and we will put out the sun and plunge the
land in darkness. Ye shall taste of our magic."

<P>&nbsp;My threat produced an effect; the men halted, and Scragga stood
still before us, his spear lifted.

<P>&nbsp;"Hear him! hear him!" piped Gagool; "hear the liar who says he
will put out the sun like a lamp. Let him do it and the girl shall be spared.
Yes, let him do it, or die with the girl, he and those with him."

<P>&nbsp;I glanced up at the sun, and, to my intense joy and relief, saw
that we had made no mistake. On the edge of its brilliant surface was a
faint rim of shadow.

<P>&nbsp;I lifted my hand solemnly towards the sky, an example which Sir
Henry and Good followed, and quoted a line or two of the "Ingoldsby Legends"
at it in the most impressive tones I could command: Sir Henry followed
suit with a verse out of the Old Testament, while Good addressed the king
of day in a volume of the most classical bad language that he could think
of.

<P>&nbsp;Slowly the dark rim crept on over the blazing surface, and as
it did so I heard a deep gasp of fear rise from the multitude around.

<P>&nbsp;"Look, O king! Look, Gagool! Look, chiefs and people and women,
and see if the white men from the stars keep their word, or if they be
but empty liars !

<P>&nbsp;"The sun grows dark before your eyes; soon there will be night
- ay, night in the noon-time. Ye have asked for a sign; it is given to
ye. Grow dark, O sun! withdraw thy light, thou bright one; bring the proud
heart to the dust, and eat up the world with shadows."

<P>&nbsp;A groan of terror rose from the on lookers. Some stood petrified
with fear, others threw themselves upon their knees and cried out. As for
the king, he sat still and turned pale beneath his dusky skin. Only Gagool
kept her courage.

<P>"It will pass," she cried; "I have seen the like before; no man can
put out the sun; lose not heart; sit still - the shadow will pass."

<P>&nbsp;"Wait, and ye shall see," I replied, hopping with excitement.
"O Moon! Moon! Moon! wherefore art thou so cold and fickle?" This appropriate
quotation I took from the pages of a popular romance that I chanced to
have read recently. Yet now I come to think of it, it was ungrateful to
abuse the Lady of the Heavens -

<P>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE>That orb&eacute;d maiden with white fire laden
<BR>Whom mortals call the moon -</BLOCKQUOTE>
who was showing herself to be truest of friends to us, however, she may
have behaved to the impassioned lover in the novel. Then I added: "Keep
it up, Good; I can't remember any more poetry. Curse away! there's a good
fellow."

<P>&nbsp;Good responded nobly to the tax upon his inventive faculties.
Never before had I the faintest conception of the breadth and depth and
height of a naval officer's objurgatory powers. For ten minutes he went
on without stopping, and he scarcely ever repeated himself.

<P>&nbsp;Meanwhile the dark ring crept on. Strange and unholy shadows encroached
upon the sunlight, an ominous quiet filled the place, the birds chirped
out frightened notes and then were still; only the cocks began to crow.

<P>&nbsp;On, yet on, crept the ring of darkness; it was now more than half
over the reddening orb. The air grew thick and dusky. On, yet on, till
we could scarcely see the fierce faces of the group before us. No sound
now rose from the spectators, and Good stopped swearing.

<P>&nbsp;"The sun is dying - the wizards have killed the sun," yelled out
the boy Scragga at last. "We shall all die in the dark," and, animated
by fear or fury, or both, he lifted his spear and drove it with all his
force at Sir Henry's broad chest. But he had forgotten the mail shirts
that the king had given us, and which we wore beneath our clothing. The
steel rebounded harmless, and before he could repeat the blow Sir Henry
had snatched the spear from his hand and sent it straight through him.
He dropped dead.

<P>&nbsp;At the sight, and driven mad with fear at the gathering gloom,
the companies of girls broke up in wild confusion and ran screeching for
the gateways. Nor did the panic stop there. The king himself, followed
by the guard, some of the chiefs, and Gagool, who hobbled away after them
with marvellous alacrity, fled for the huts, so that in another minute
or so ourselves, the would-be victim, Foulata, Infadoos, and some of the
chiefs who had interviewed us on the previous night, were left alone upon
the scene with the dead body of Scragga.

<P>&nbsp;"Now, chiefs," I said, "we have given you the sign. If ye are
satisfied, let us fly swiftly to the place ye spoke of. The charm cannot
now be stopped. It will work for an hour. Let us take advantage of the
darkness."

<P>&nbsp;"Come," said Infadoos, turning to go, an example which was followed
by the awed chiefs, ourselves, and the girl Foulata, whom Good took by
the hand.

<P>&nbsp;Before we reached the gate of the kraal the sun went out altogether.

<P>&nbsp;Holding each other by the hand we stumbled on through the darkness.
