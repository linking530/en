CHAPTER VIII</H2>

<H2>
WE ENTER KUKUANALAND</H2>
ALL that afternoon we travelled on along the magnificent roadway, which
headed steadily in a northwesterly direction. Infadoos and Scragga walked
with us, but their followers marched about one hundred paces ahead.

<P>&nbsp;"Infadoos," I said at length, "who made this road?"

<P>&nbsp;"It was made, my lord, of old time, none knew how or when, not
even the wise woman, Gagool, who has lived for generations. We are not
old enough to remember its making. None can make such roads now, but the
king lets no grass grow upon it."

<P>&nbsp;"And whose are the writings on the walls of the caves through
which we have passed on the road?" I asked, referring to the Egyptian-like
Sculptures we had seen.

<P>&nbsp;"My lord, the hands that made the road wrote the wonderful writings.
We know not who wrote. them."

<P>&nbsp;"When did the Kukuana race come into this country?"

<P>&nbsp;"My lord, the race came down here like the breath of a storm ten
thousand thousand moons ago, from the great lands which lie there beyond,"
and he pointed to the north. "They could travel no farther, so say the
old voices of our fathers that have come down to us, the children, and
so says Gagool, the wise woman, the smeller-out of witches; because of
the great mountains which ring in the land," and he pointed to the snow-clad
peaks. "The country, too, was good, so they settled here and grew strong
and powerful, and now our numbers are like the sea sand, and when Twala
the king calls up his regiments their plumes cover the plain as far as
the eye of man can reach."

<P>&nbsp;"And if the land is walled in with mountains, who is there for
the regiments to fight with?"

<P>&nbsp;"Nay, my lord, the country is open there," and again he pointed
towards the north, "and now and again warriors sweep down upon us in clouds
from a land we know not, and we slay them. It is the third part of the
life of a man since there was a war. Many thousands died in it, but we
destroyed those who came to eat us up. So, since then there has been no
war."

<P>&nbsp;"Your warriors must grow weary of resting on their spears."

<P>&nbsp;"My lord, there was one war, just after we destroyed the people
that came down upon us, but it was a civil war - dog eat dog."

<P>&nbsp;"How was that?"

<P>&nbsp;"My lord, the king, my half-brother, had a brother born at the
same birth and of the same woman. It is not our custom, my lord, to let
twins live; the weakest must always die. But the mother of the king hid
away the weakest child, which was born the last, for her heart yearned
over it, and the child is Twala the king. I am his younger brother born
of another wife."

<P>&nbsp;"My lord, Kafa, our father, died when we came to manhood, and
my brother Imotu was made king in his place, and for a space reigned and
had a son by his favorite wife. When the babe was three years old, just
after the great war, during which no man could sow or reap, a famine came
upon the land, and the people murmured because of the famine, and looked
round like a starved lion for something to rend. Then it was that Gagool,
the wise and terrible woman, who does not die, proclaimed to the people,
saying, `The king Imotu is no king.' And at the time Imotu was sick with
a wound, and lay in his hut not able to move.

<P>&nbsp;"Then Gagool went into a hut and led out Twala, my half-brother,
and the twin brother of the king, whom she had hidden since he was born
among the caves and rocks, and, stripping the `moocha' (waist-cloth) off
his loins, showed the people of the Kukuanas the mark of the sacred snake
coiled round his waist, wherewith the eldest son of the king is marked
at birth, and cried out loud, `Behold, your king, whom I have saved for
you even to this day!' And the people, being mad with hunger and altogether.
bereft of reason and the knowledge of truth. cried out, `<I>The king! The
king!</I>' but I knew that it was not so, for Imotu, my brother, was the
elder of the twins, and was the lawful king. And just as the tumult was
at its height Imotu the king, though he was very sick, came crawling from
his hut holding his wife by the hand, and followed by his little son Ignosi
(the lightning).

<P>&nbsp;"'What is this noise?' he asked; `Why cry ye <I>The king! The
king!</I>'

<P>&nbsp;"Then Twala, his own brother, born of the same woman and in the
same hour, ran to him, and, taking him by the hair, stabbed him through
the heart with his knife. And the people, being fickle, and ever ready
to worship the rising sun, clapped their hands and cried, `<I>Twala is
king!</I> Now we know that Twala is king!'"

<P>&nbsp;"And what became of his wife and her son Ignosi? Did Twala kill
them too?"

<P>&nbsp;"Nay, my lord. When she saw that her lord was dead she seized
the child with a cry, and ran away. Two days afterwards she came to a kraal
very hungry, and none would give her milk or food, now that her lord the
king was dead, for all men hate the unfortunate. But at nightfall a little
child, a girl, crept out and brought her to eat, and she blessed the child,
and went on towards the mountains with her boy before the sun rose again,
where she must have perished, for none have seen her since, nor the child
Ignosi."

<P>&nbsp;"Then if this child Ignosi had lived, he would be the true king
of the Kukuana people?"

<P>&nbsp;"That is so, my lord; the sacred snake is round his middle. If
he lives he is the king; but alas! he is long dead."

<P>&nbsp;"See, my lord," and he pointed to a vast collection of huts surrounded
with a fence, which was in its turn surrounded by a great ditch, that lay
on the plain beneath us. "That is the kraal where the wife of Imotu was
last seen with the child Ignosi. It is there that we shall sleep to-night,
if, indeed," he added, doubtfully, "my lords sleep at all upon this earth."

<P>&nbsp;"When we are among the Kukuanas, my good friend Infadoos, we do
as the Kukuanas do," I said, majestically, and I turned round suddenly
to address Good, who was tramping along sullenly behind, his mind fully
occupied with unsatisfactory attempts to. keep his flannel shirt from flapping
up in the evening breeze, and to my astonishment butted into Umbopa, who
was walking along immediately behind me, and had very evidently been listening
with the greatest interest to my conversation with Infadoos. The expression
on his face was most curious, and gave the idea of a man who was struggling
with partial success to bring something long ago forgotten back into his
mind.

<P>&nbsp;All this while we had been pressing on at a good rate down towards
the undulating plain beneath. The mountains we had crossed now loomed high
above us, and Sheba's breasts were modestly veiled in diaphanous wreaths
of mist.

<P>&nbsp;As we went on the country grew more and more lovely. The vegetation
was luxuriant without being tropical; the sun was bright and warm, but
not burning, and a gracious breeze blew softly along the odorous slopes
of the mountains. And, indeed, this new land was little less. than an earthly
paradise; in beauty, in natural wealth, and in climate I have never seen
its like. The Transvaal is a fine country, but it is nothing to Kukuanaland.

<P>&nbsp;So soon as we started, Infadoos had despatched a runner on to
warn the people of the kraal, which, by the way, was in his military command,
of our arrival. This man had departed at an extraordinary speed, which
Infadoos had informed me he would keep up all the way, as running was an
exercise much practised among his people.

<P>&nbsp;The result of this message now became apparent. When we got within
two miles of the kraal, we could see that company after company of men
was issuing from its gates and marching towards us.

<P>&nbsp;Sir Henry laid his hand upon my arm, and remarked that it looked
as though we were going to meet with a warm reception. Something in his
tone attracted Infadoos's attention.

<P>&nbsp;"Let not my lords be afraid," he said, hastily, "for in my breast
there dwells no guile. This regiment is one under my command, and comes
out by my orders to greet you."

<P>&nbsp;I nodded easily, though I was not quite easy in my mind.

<P>&nbsp;About half a mile from the gates of the kraal was a long stretch
of rising ground sloping gently upward from the road, and on this the companies
formed. It was a splendid sight to see them, each company about three hundred
strong, charging swiftly up the slope, with flashing spears and waving
plumes, and taking their appointed place. By the time we came to the slope
twelve such companies, or in all three thousand six hundred men, had passed
out and taken up their positions along the road.

<P>&nbsp;Presently we came to the first company, and were able to gaze
in astonishment on the most magnificent set of men I have ever seen. They
were all men of mature age, mostly veterans of about forty, and not one
of them was under six feet in height, while many were six feet three or
four. They wore upon their heads heavy black plumes of Sacaboola feathers,
like those which adorned our guides. Round their waists and also beneath
the right knee were bound circlets of white ox-tails, and in their left
hands were round shields about twenty inches across. These shields were
very curious. The framework consisted of an iron plate beaten out thin,
over which was stretched milk-white ox-hide. The weapons that each man
bore were simple, but most effective, consisting of a short and very heavy
two-edged spear with a wooden shaft, the blade being about six inches across
at the widest part. These spears were not used for throwing, but, like
the Zulu "bangwan," or stabbing assegai, were for close quarters only,
when the wound inflicted by them was terrible. In addition to these bangwans
each man also carried three large and heavy knives, each knife weighing
about two pounds. One knife was fixed in the oxtail girdle, and the other
two at the back of the round shield. These knives, which are called "tollas"
by the Kukuanas, take the place of the throwing assegai of the Zulus. A
Kukuana warrior can throw them with great accuracy at a distance of fifty
yards, and it is their custom on charging to hurl a volley of them at the
enemy as they come to close quarters.

<P>&nbsp;Each company stood like a collection of bronze statues till we
were opposite to it, when, at a signal given by its commanding officer,
who, distinguished by a leopard-skin cloak, stood some paces in front,
every spear was raised into the air, and from three hundred throats sprang
forth with a sudden roar the royal salute of "<I>Koom!</I>" Then, when
we had passed, the company formed behind us and followed us towards the
kraal, till at last the whole regiment of the "Grays" (so called from their
white shields), the crack corps of the Kukuana people, was marching behind
us with a tread that shook the ground. At length, branching off from Solomon's
Great. Road, we came to the wide fosse surrounding the kraal, which was
at least a mile round and fenced with a strong palisade of piles formed
of the trunks of trees. At the gateway this fosse was spanned by a primitive
drawbridge which was let down by the guard to allow us to pass in. The
kraal was exceedingly well laid out. Through the centre ran a wide pathway
intersected at right angles by other pathways so arranged as to cut the
huts into square blocks, each block being the quarters of a company. The
huts were dome shaped, and built, like those of the Zulus, of a framework
of wattle beautifully thatched with grass; but, unlike the Zulu huts, they
had doorways through which one could walk. Also they were much larger,
and surrounded with a veranda about six feet wide, beautifully paved with
powdered lime trodden hard. All along each side of the wide pathway that
pierced the kraal were ranged hundreds of women, brought out by curiosity
to look at us. These women are, for a native race, exceedingly handsome.
They are tall and graceful, and their figures are wonderfully fine. The
hair, though short, is rather curly than woolly, the features are frequently
aquiline, and the lips are not unpleasantly thick, as is the case in most
African races. But what struck us most was their exceeding quiet, dignified
air. They were as well-bred in their way as the <I>habitu&eacute;</I> of
a fashionable drawing-room, and in this respect differ from Zulu women,
and their cousins, the Masai, who inhabit the district behind Zanzibar.
Their curiosity had brought them out to see us, but they allowed no rude
expression of wonder or savage criticism to pass their lips as we trudged
wearily in front of them. Not even when old Infadoos with a surreptitious
motion of the hand pointed out the crowning wonder of poor Good's "beautiful
white legs," did they allow the feeling of intense admiration which evidently
mastered their minds to find expression. They fixed their dark eyes upon
their snowy loveliness (Good's skin is exceedingly white) and that was
all. But this was quite enough for Good, who is modest by nature.

<P>&nbsp;When we got to the centre of the kraal Infadoos halted at the
door of a large hut, which was surrounded at a distance by a circle of
smaller ones.

<P>&nbsp;"Enter, sons of the stars," he. said, in a magniloquent voice,
"and deign to rest awhile in our humble habitations. A little food shall
be brought to you, so that ye shall have no need to draw your belts tight
from hunger; some honey and some milk, and an ox or two, and a few sheep;
not much, my lords, but still a little food."

<P>&nbsp;"It is good," said I, "Infadoos, we are weary with travelling
through realms of air; now let us rest."

<P>&nbsp;Accordingly we entered into the hut, which we found amply prepared
for our comfort. Couches of tanned skins were spread for us to rest on,
and water was placed for us to wash in.

<P>&nbsp;Presently we heard a shouting outside, and, stepping to the door,
saw a line of damsels bearing milk and roasted mealies and honey in a pot.
Behind these were some youths driving a fat young ox. We received the gifts,
and then one of the young men took the knife from his girdle and dexterously
cut the ox's throat. In ten minutes it was dead, skinned, and cut up. The
best of the meat was then cut off for us, and the rest I, in the name of
our party, presented to the warriors round us, who took it off and distributed
the "white men's gift."

<P>&nbsp;Umbopa set to work, with the assistance of an extremely prepossessing
young woman, to boil our portion in a huge earthenware pot over a fire
which was built outside the hut, and when it was nearly ready we sent a
message to Infadoos, and asked him, and Scragga the king's son, to join
us.

<P>&nbsp;Presently they came, and, sitting down upon little stools, of
which there were several about the hut (for the Kukuanas do not in general
squat upon their haunches like the Zulus), helped us to get through our
dinner. The old gentleman was most affable and polite, but it struck us
that the young one regarded us with suspicion. He had, together with the
rest of the party, been overawed by our white appearance and by our magic
properties; but it seemed to me that on discovering that we ate, drank,
and slept like other mortals, his awe was beginning to wear off and be
replaced by a sullen suspicion, which made us feel rather uncomfortable.

<P>&nbsp;In the course of our meal Sir Henry suggested to me that it might
be well to try and discover if our hosts knew anything of his brother's
fate, or if they had ever seen or heard of him; but, on the whole, I thought
that it would be wiser to say nothing of the matter at that time.

<P>&nbsp;After supper we filled our pipes and lit them; a proceeding which
filled Infadoos and Scragga with astonishment. The Kukuanas were evidently
unacquainted with the divine uses of tobacco-smoke. The herb was grown
among them extensively; but, like the Zulus, they only used it for snuff,
and quite failed to identify it in its new form.

<P>&nbsp;Presently I asked Infadoos when we were to proceed on our journey,
and was delighted to learn that preparations had been made for us to leave
on the following morning, messengers having already left to inform Twala,
the king, of our coming. It appeared that Twala was at his principal place,
known as Loo, making ready for the great annual feast which was held in
the first week of June. At this gathering all the regiments, with the exception
of certain detachments left behind for garrison purposes, were brought
up and paraded before the king, and the great annual witch-hunt, of which
more by and by, was held.

<P>&nbsp;We were to start at dawn; and Infadoos, who was to accompany us,
expected that we should, unless we were detained by accident or by swollen
rivers, reach Loo on the night of the second day.

<P>&nbsp;When they had given us this information our visitors bade us good-night;
and, having arranged to watch turn and turn about, three of us flung ourselves
down and slept the sweet sleep of the weary, while the fourth sat up on
the lookout for possible treachery.
