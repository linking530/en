CHAPTER XII</H2>

<H3>
BEFORE THE BATTLE</H3>
LUCKILY for us, Infadoos and the chiefs knew all the pathways of the great
town perfectly, so that, notwithstanding the intense gloom, we made fair
progress.

<P>&nbsp;For an hour or more we journeyed on, till at length the eclipse
began to pass, and that edge of the sun which had disappeared the first
became again visible. In another five minutes there was sufficient light
to see our whereabouts, and we then discovered that we were clear of the
town of Loo, and approaching a large, flat-topped hill, measuring some
two miles in circumference. This hill, which was of a formation very common
in Southern Africa, was not very high; indeed, its greatest elevation was
not more than two hundred feet, but it was shaped like a horseshoe, and
its sides were rather precipitous and strewn with boulders. On the grass
table-land at the top was ample camping-ground, which had been utilized
as a military cantonment of no mean strength. Its ordinary garrison was
one regiment of three thousand. men, but as we toiled up the steep side
of the hill in the returning daylight we perceived that there were many
more warriors than that upon it.

<P>&nbsp;Reaching the table-land at last, we found crowds of men huddled
together in the utmost consternation at the natural phenomenon which they
were witnessing. Passing through these without a word, we gained a hut
in the centre of the ground, where we were astonished to find two men waiting,
laden with our few goods and chattels, which, of course, we had been obliged
to leave behind in our hasty flight.

<P>&nbsp;"I sent for them," explained Infadoos; "also for these," and he
lifted up Good's long-lost trousers.

<P>&nbsp;With an exclamation of rapturous delight Good sprang at them,
and instantly proceeded to put them on.

<P>&nbsp;"Surely my lord will not hide his beautiful white legs!" exclaimed
lnfadoos, regretfully.

<P>&nbsp;But Good persisted, and once only did the Kukuana people get the
chance of seeing his beautiful legs again. Good is a very modest man. Henceforward
they had to satisfy their aesthetic longings with one whisker, his transparent
eye, and his movable teeth.

<P>&nbsp;Still gazing with fond remembrance at Good's trousers, Infadoos
next informed us that he had summoned the regiments to explain to them
fully the rebellion which was decided on by the chiefs, and to introduce
to them the rightful heir to the throne, Ignosi.

<P>&nbsp;In half an hour the troops, in all nearly twenty thousand men,
constituting the flower of the Kukuana army, were mustered on a large,
open space, to which we proceeded. The men were drawn up in three sides
of a dense square, and presented a magnificent spectacle. We took our station
on the open side of the square, and were speedily surrounded by all the
principal chiefs and. officers.

<P>&nbsp;These, after silence had been proclaimed, Infadoos proceeded to
address. He narrated to them in vigorous and graceful language - -for,
like most Kukuanas of high rank, he was a born orator - the history of
Ignosi's father, how he had been basely murdered by Twala, the king, and
his wife and child driven out to starve. Then he pointed out how the land
suffered and groaned under Twala's cruel rule, instancing the proceedings
of the previous night, when, under pretence of their being evil-doers,
many of the noblest in the land had been hauled forth and cruelly done
to death. Next he went on to say that the white lords from the stars, looking
down on the land, had perceived its trouble, and determined, at great personal
inconvenience, to alleviate its lot; how they had accordingly taken the
real king of the country, Ignosi, who was languishing in exile, by the
hand and led him over the mountains; how they had seen the wickedness of
Twala's doings, and for a sign to the wavering, and to save the life of
the girl Foulata, had actually, by the exercise of their high magic, put
out the sun and slain the young fiend, Scragga; and how they were prepared
to stand by them, and assist them to overthrow Twala, and set up the rightful
king - Ignosi, in his place.

<P>&nbsp;He finished his discourse amid a murmur of approbation, and then
Ignosi stepped forward and began to speak. Having reiterated all that Infadoos,
his uncle, had said, he concluded a powerful speech in these words:

<P>&nbsp;"O chiefs, captains, soldiers, and people, ye have heard my words.
Now must ye make choice between me and him who sits upon my throne, the
uncle who killed his brother, and hunted his brother's child forth to die
in the cold and the night. That I am indeed the king these" - pointing
to the chiefs - "can tell ye, for they have seen the snake about my middle.
If I were not the king, would these white men be on my side, with all their
magic? Tremble, chiefs, captains, soldiers, and people! Is not the darkness
they have brought upon the land to confound Twala, and cover our flight,
yet before your eyes?"

<P>&nbsp;"It is," answered the soldiers.

<P>&nbsp;"I am the king; I say to ye, I am the king," went on Ignosi, drawing
up his great stature to its full, and lifting his broad-bladed battle-axe
above his head. "If there be any man among ye who says that it is not so,
let him stand forth, and I will fight him now, and his blood shall be a
red token that I tell ye true. Let him stand forth, I say"; and he shook
the great axe till it flashed in the sunlight.

<P>&nbsp;As nobody seemed inclined to respond to this heroic version of
"Dilly, Dilly, come and be killed," our late henchman proceeded with his
address.

<P>&nbsp;"I am indeed the king, and if ye do stand by my side in the battle,
if I win the day ye shall go with me to victory and honor. I will give
ye oxen and wives, and ye shall take place of all the regiments; and if
ye fall I will fall with ye.

<P>&nbsp;"And behold, this promise do I give ye, that when I sit upon the
seat of my fathers, bloodshed shall cease in the land. No longer shall
ye cry for justice to find slaughter, no longer shall the witch-finder
hunt ye out so that ye be slain without a cause. No man shall die save
he who offendeth against the laws. The "eating up" of your kraals shall
cease; each shall sleep secure in his own hut and fear not, and justice
shall walk blind throughout the land. Have ye chosen, chiefs, captains,
soldiers, and people?"

<P>&nbsp;"We have chosen, O king," came back the answer.

<P>&nbsp;"It is well. Turn your heads and see how Twala's messengers go
forth from the great town, east and west, and north and south, to gather
a mighty army to slay me and ye, and these my friends and my protectors.
To-morrow, or perchance the next day, will he come with all who are faithful
to him. Then shall I see the man who is indeed my man, the man who fears
not to die for his cause; and I tell ye he shall not be forgotten in the
time of spoil. I have spoken, O chiefs, captains, soldiers, and people.
Now go to your huts and make you ready for war."

<P>&nbsp;There was a pause, and then one of the chiefs lifted his hand,
and out rolled the royal salute, "<I>Koom!</I>" It was a sign that the
regiments accepted Ignosi as their king. Then they marched off in battalions.

<P>&nbsp;Half an hour afterwards we held a council of war, at which all
the commanders of regiments were present, It was evident to us that before
very long we should be attacked in overwhelming force. Indeed, from our
point of vantage on the hill we could see troops mustering, and messengers.
going forth from Loo in every direction, doubtless to summon regiments
to the king's assistance. We had on our side about twenty thousand men,
composed of seven of the best regiments in the country. Twala had, so Infadoos
and the chiefs calculated, at least thirty to thirty-five thousand on whom
he could rely at present assembled in Loo, and they thought that by midday
on the morrow he would be able to gather another five thousand or more
to his aid.

<P>&nbsp;It was, of course, possible that some of his troops would desert
and come over to us, but it was not a contingency that could be reckoned
on. Meanwhile, it was clear that active preparations were being made to
subdue us. Already strong bodies of armed men were patrolling round and
round the foot of the hill, and there were other signs of a coming attack.

<P>&nbsp;Infadoos and the chiefs, however, were of opinion that no attack
would take place that night, which would be devoted to preparation and
to the removal by every possible means of the moral effect produced upon
the minds of the soldiery by the supposed magical darkening of the sun.
The attack would be on the morrow, they said, and they proved to be right.

<P>&nbsp;Meanwhile, we set to work to strengthen the position as much as
possible. Nearly the entire force was turned out, and in the two hours
which yet remained to sundown wonders were done. The paths up the hill
- which was rather a sanitarium than a fortress, being used generally as
the camping place of regiments suffering from recent service in unhealthy
portions of the country - were carefully blocked with masses of stones,
and every other possible approach was made as impregnable as time would
allow. Piles of boulders were collected at various spots to be rolled down
upon advancing enemy-stations were appointed to the different regiments,
and every other preparation which our joint ingenuity could suggest was
taken.

<P>&nbsp;Just before sundown we perceived a small company of men advancing
towards us from the direction of Loo, one of whom bore a palm leaf in his
hand as a sign that he came as a herald.

<P>&nbsp;As he came, Ignosi, Infadoos, one or two chiefs, and ourselves
went down to the foot of the mountain to meet him. He was a gallant-looking
fellow, with the regulation leopard-skin cloak.

<P>&nbsp;"Greeting!" he cried as he came near; "the king's greeting to
those who make unholy war against the king; the lion's greeting to the
jackals who snarl around his heels."

<P>&nbsp;"Speak," I said.

<P>&nbsp;"These are the king's words. Surrender to the king's mercy ere
a worse thing befall ye. Already the shoulder has been torn from the black
bull, and the king drives him bleeding about the Camp."

<P>&nbsp;"What are Twala's terms?" I asked, for curiosity.

<P>&nbsp;"His terms are merciful, worthy of a great king. These are the
words of Twala, the one-eyed, the mighty, the husband of a thousand wives,
lord of the Kukuanas, keeper of the great road (Solomon's Road), beloved
of the strange ones who sit in silence at the mountains yonder (the Three
Witches), calf of the black cow, elephant whose tread shakes the earth,
terror of the evil-doer, ostrich whose feet devour the desert, huge one,
black one, wise one, king from generation to generation! these are the
words of Twala: `I will have mercy and be satisfied with a little blood.
One in every ten shall die, the rest shall go free; but the white man Incubu,
who slew Scragga, my son, and Infadoos, my brother, who brews rebellion
against me, these shall die by torture as an offering to the silent ones.'
Such are the merciful words of Twala." After consulting with the others
a little I answered him in a loud voice, so that the soldiers might hear,
thus:

<P>&nbsp;"Go back, thou dog, to Twala, who sent thee, and say that we,
Ignosi, veritable king of the Kukuanas, Incubu, Bougwan, and Macumazahn,
the wise white ones from the stars who make dark the sun, Infadoos, of
the royal house, and the chiefs, captains, and people here gathered, make
answer and say, `That we will not surrender; that before the sun has twice
gone down Twala's corpse shall stiffen at Twala's gate, and Ignosi, whose
father Twala slew, shall reign in his stead.' Now go, ere we whip thee
away, and beware how ye lift a hand against such as we."

<P>&nbsp;The herald laughed loud. "Ye frighten not men with such swelling
words," he cried out. "Show yourselves as bold tomorrow, O ye who darken
the sun. Be bold, fight, and be merry, before the crows pick your bones
till they are whiter than your faces. Farewell; perhaps we may meet in
the fight; wait for me, I pray, white men." And with this shaft of sarcasm
he retired, and almost immediately the sun sank.

<P>&nbsp;That night was a busy one for us, for, as far as was possible
by the moonlight, all preparations for the morrow's. fight were continued.
Messengers were constantly coming and going from the place where we sat
in council. At last, about an hour after midnight, everything that could
be done was done, and the camp, save for the occasional challenge of a
sentry, sank into sleep. Sir Henry and I, accompanied by Ignosi and one
of the chiefs, descended the hill and made the round of the vedettes. As
we went, suddenly, from all sorts of unexpected places, spears gleamed
out in the moonlight, only to vanish again as we uttered the password.
It was clear to us that none were sleeping at their posts. Then we returned,
picking our way through thousands of sleeping warriors, many of whom were
taking their last earthly rest.

<P>&nbsp;The moonlight flickered along their spears, and played upon their
features and made them ghastly; the chilly night wind tossed their tall
and hearse like plumes. There they lay in wild confusion, with arms outstretched
and twisted limbs; their stern, stalwart forms looking weird and unhuman
in the moonlight.

<P>&nbsp;"How many of these do you suppose will be alive at this time to-morrow?"
asked Sir Henry.

<P>&nbsp;I shook my head and looked again at the sleeping men, and to my
tired and yet excited imagination it seemed as though death had already
touched them. My mind's eye singled out those who were sealed to slaughter,
and there rushed in upon my heart a great sense of the mystery of human
life, and an overwhelming sorrow at its futility and sadness. To-night
these thousands slept their healthy sleep; to-morrow they, and many others
with them, ourselves perhaps among them, would be stiffening in the cold;
their wives would be widows, their children fatherless, and their place
know them no more forever. Only the old moon would shine serenely on, the
night wind would stir the grasses, and the wide earth would take its happy
rest, even as it did aeons before these were, and will do aeons after they
have been forgotten.

<P>&nbsp;Yet man dies not while the world, at once his mother and his monument,
remains. His name is forgotten, indeed, but the breath he breathed yet
stirs the pine-tops on the mountains, the sound of the words he spoke yet
echoes on through space; the thoughts his brain gave birth to we have inherited
to-day; his passions are our cause of life; the joys and sorrows that he
felt are our familiar friends - the end from which he fled aghast will
surely overtake us also.

<P>&nbsp;Truly the universe is full of ghosts; not sheeted, churchyard
spectres, but the inextinguishable and immortal elements of life, which,
having once been, can never <I>die</I>, though they blend and change and
change again forever.

<P>&nbsp;All sorts of reflections of this sort passed through my mind -
for as I get older I regret to say that a detestable habit of thinking
seems to be getting a hold of me - -while I stood and stared at those grim
yet fantastic lines of warriors sleeping, as their saying goes, "upon their
spears."

<P>&nbsp;"Curtis," I said to Sir Henry, !"I am in a condition of pitiable
funk."

<P>&nbsp;Sir Henry stroked his yellow beard and laughed, as he answered:

<P>&nbsp;"I've heard you make that sort of remark before, Quatermain."

<P>&nbsp;"Well, I mean it now. Do you know, I very much doubt if one of
us will be alive to-morrow night. We shall be attacked in overwhelming
force, and it is exceedingly doubtful if we can hold this place."

<P>&nbsp;"We'll give a good account of some of them, at any rate. Look
here, Quatermain, the business is a nasty one, and one with which, properly
speaking, we ought not to be mixed up; but we are in for it, so we must
make the best of it. Speaking personally, I had rather be killed fighting
than any other way, and now that there seems little chance of finding my
poor brother, it makes the idea easier to me. But fortune favors the brave,
and we may succeed. Anyway, the slaughter will be awful, and as we. have
a reputation to keep up, we shall have to be in the thick of it."

<P>&nbsp;Sir Henry made this last remark in a mournful voice, but there
was a gleam in his eye which belied it. I have a sort of idea that Sir
Henry Curtis actually likes fighting.

<P>&nbsp;After this we went and slept for a couple of hours.

<P>&nbsp;Just about dawn we were awakened by Infadoos, who came to say
that great activity was to be observed in too, and that parties of the
king's skirmishers were driving in our vedettes.

<P>&nbsp;We got up and dressed ourselves for the fray, each putting on
his chain armor shirt, for which at the present juncture we felt exceedingly
thankful. Sir Henry went the whole length about the matter, and dressed
himself like a native warrior. "When you are in Kukuanaland, do as the
Kukuanas do," he remarked, as he drew the shining steel over his broad
shoulders, which it fitted like a glove. Nor did he stop there. At his
request, Infadoos had provided him with a complete set of war uniform.
Round his throat he fastened the leopard-skin cloak of a commanding officer,
on his brows he bound the plume of black ostrich feathers worn only by
generals of high rank, and round his centre a magnificent moocha of white
oxtail. A pair of sandals, a leglet of goat's hair, a heavy battle-axe
with a rhinoceros-horn handle, a round iron shield covered with white ox-hide,
and the regulation number of tollas, or throwing-knives, made up his equipment,
to which, however, he added his revolver. The dress was, no doubt, a savage
one; but I am bound to say I never saw a finer sight than Sir Henry Curtis
presented in this guise. It showed off his magnificent physique to the
greatest advantage, and when Ignosi arrived, presently, arrayed in similar
costume, I thought to myself that I never before saw two such splendid
men. As for Good and myself, the chain armor did not suit us nearly so
well. To begin with, Good insisted upon keeping on his trousers, and a
stout, short gentleman with an eye-glass, and one half of his face shaved,
arrayed in a mail shirt carefully tucked into a very seedy pair of corduroys,
looks more striking than imposing. As for myself, my chain shirt being
too big for me, I put it on over all my clothes, which caused it to bulge
out in a somewhat ungainly fashion. I discarded my trousers, however, determined
to go into battle with bare legs, in order to be the lighter in case it.
became necessary to retire quickly, retaining only my veldtschoons. This,
a spear, a shield, which I did not know how to use, a couple of tollas,
a revolver, and a huge plume, which I pinned into the top of my shooting-hat
in order to give a bloodthirsty finish to my appearance, completed my modest
equipment. In addition to all these articles, of course we had our rifles,
but as ammunition was scarce, and they would be useless in case of a charge,
we had arranged to have them carried behind us by bearers.

<P>&nbsp;As soon as we had equipped ourselves we hastily swallowed some
food, and then started out to see how things were progressing. At one point
in the tableland of the mountain there was a little koppie of brown stone,
which served for the double purpose of headquarters and a conning tower.
Here we found Infadoos surrounded, by his own regiment, the Grays, which
was undoubtedly the finest in the Kukuana army, and the same which we had
first seen at the outlying kraal. This regiment, now three thousand five
hundred strong, was being held in reserve, and the men were lying down
on the grass in companies, and watching the king's forces creep out of
Lo o in long, ant-like columns. There seemed to be no end to those columns
- three in all, and each numbering at least eleven or twelve thousand men.

<P>&nbsp;As soon as they were clear of the town, they formed up. Then one
body marched off to the right, one to the left, and the third came slowly
on towards us.

<P>&nbsp;"Ah," said Infadoos, "they are going to attack us on three sides
at once."

<P>&nbsp;This was rather serious news, for as our position on the top of
the mountain, which was at least a mile and a half in circumference, was
an extended one, it was important to us to concentrate our comparatively
small defending force as much as possible. But, as it was impossible for
us to dictate in what way we should be attacked, we had to make the best
of it, and accordingly sent orders to the various regiments to prepare
to receive the separate onslaughts.
