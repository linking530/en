CHAPTER I</H2>

<H3>
I MEET SIR HENRY CURTIS</H3>
IT is a curious thing that at my age - fifty-five last birthday - I should
find myself taking up a pen to try and write a history. I wonder what sort
of a history it will be when I have done it, if I ever come to the end
of the trip! I have done a good many things in my life, which seems a long
one to me, owing to my having begun so young, perhaps. At an age when other
boys are at school I was earning my living as a trader in the old Colony.
I have been trading, hunting, fighting, or mining ever since. And yet it
is only eight months ago that I made my pile. It is a big pile now I have
got it - I don't yet know how big - but I don't think I would go through
the last fifteen or sixteen months again for it; no, not if I knew that
I should come out safe at the end, pile and all. But then, I am a timid
man, and don't like violence, and am pretty sick of adventure. I wonder
why I am going to write this book; it is not in my line. I am not a literary
man, though very devoted to the Old Testament and also to the "Ingoldsby
Legends." Let me try and set down my reasons, just to see if I have any.

<P>&nbsp;First reason: Because Sir Henry Curtis and Captain John Good asked
me to.

<P>&nbsp;Second reason: Because I am laid up here at Durban with the pain
and trouble in my left leg. Ever since that confounded lion got hold of
me I have been liable to it, and its being rather bad just now makes me
limp more than ever. There must be some poison in a lion's teeth, otherwise
how is it that when your wounds are healed they break out again, generally,
mark you, at the same time of year that you got your mauling? It is a hard
thing that when one has shot sixty-five lions, as I have in the course
of my life, that the sixty-sixth should chew your leg like a quid of tobacco.
It breaks the routine of the thing, and, putting other considerations aside,
I am an orderly man and don't like that. This is by the way.

<P>&nbsp;Third reason: Because I want my boy Harry, who is over there at
the hospital in London studying to become a doctor, to have something to
amuse him and keep him out of mischief for a week or so. Hospital work
must sometimes pall and get rather dull, for even of cutting-up dead bodies
there must come satiety, and as this history won't be dull, whatever else
it may be, it may put a little life into things for a day or two while
he is reading it.

<P>&nbsp;Fourth reason and last: Because I am going to tell the strangest
story that I know of. It may seem a queer thing to say that, especially
considering that there is no woman in it except Foulata. Stop, though!
there is Gagaoola, if she was a woman and not a fiend. But she was a hundred
at least, and therefore not marriageable, so I don't count her. At any
rate, I can safely say that there is not a <I>petticoat</I> in the whole
history. Well, I had better come to the yoke. It's a stiff place, and I
feel as though I were bogged up to the axle. But "sutjes, sutjes," as the
Boers say (I'm sure I don't know how they spell it), softly does it. A
strong team will come through at last, that is if they ain't too poor.
You will never do anything with poor oxen. Now, to begin.

<P>&nbsp;I, Allan Quatermain, of Durban, Natal, Gentleman, make oath and
say - That's how I began my deposition before the magistrate about poor
Khiva's and Ventvo"gel's sad deaths; but somehow it doesn't seem quite
the right way to begin a book. And, besides, am I a gentleman? What is
a gentleman? I don't quite know, and yet I have had to do with niggers
- no, I'll scratch that word "niggers" out, for I don't like it. I've known
natives who <I>are</I>, and so you'll say, Harry, my boy, before you're
done with this tale, and I have known mean whites with lots of money and
fresh out from home, too, who <I>ain't</I>. Well, at any rate I was born
a gentleman, though I've been nothing but a poor travelling trader and
hunter all my life. Whether I have remained so I know not; you must judge
of that. Heaven knows I've tried. I've killed many men in my time, but
I have never slain wantonly or stained my hand in innocent blood, only
in self-defence. The Almighty gave us our lives, and I suppose he meant
us to defend them; at least I have always acted on that, and I hope it
won't be brought up against me when my clock strikes. There, there; it
is a cruel and a wicked world, and, for a timid man, I have been mixed
up in a deal of slaughter. I can't tell the rights of it, but at any rate
I have never stolen, though I once cheated a Kaffir out of a herd of cattle.
But then, he had done me a dirty turn, and it has troubled me ever since
into the bargain.

<P>&nbsp;Well, it's eighteen months or so ago since I first met Sir Henry
Curtis and Captain Good, and it was in this way. I had been up elephant
hunting beyond Bamangwato, and had had bad luck. Everything went wrong
that trip, and to top up with I got the fever badly. So soon as I was well
enough I trekked down to the Diamond Fields, sold such ivory as I had,
and also my wagon and oxen, discharged my hunters, and took the post-cart
to the Cape. After spending a week in Cape Town, finding that they overcharged
me at the hotel, and having seen everything there was to see, including
the botanical gardens, which seem to me likely to confer a great benefit
on the country, and the new Houses of Parliament, which I expect will do
nothing of the sort, I determined to go on back to Natal by the <I>Dunkeld</I>,
then lying in the docks waiting for the <I>Edinburgh Castle</I> due in
from England. I took my berth and went aboard, and that afternoon the Natal
passengers from the <I>Edinburgh Castle</I> transhipped, and we weighed
anchor and put out to sea.

<P>&nbsp;Among the passengers who came on board there were two who excited
my curiosity. One, a man of about thirty, was one of the biggest-chested
and longest-armed men I ever saw. He had yellow hair, a big yellow beard,
clear-cut features, and large gray eyes set deep into his head. I never
saw a finer-looking man, and somehow he reminded me of an ancient Dane.
Not that I know much of ancient Danes, though I remember a modern Dane
who did me out of ten pounds; but I remember once seeing a picture of some
of those gentry, who, I take it, were a kind of white Zulus. They were
drinking out of big horns, and their long hair hung down their backs, and
as I looked at my friend standing there by the companion-ladder, I thought
that if one only let his hair grow a bit, put one of those chain shirts
on to those great shoulders of his, and gave him a big battle-axe and a
horn mug, he might have sat as a model for that picture. And, by the way,
it is a curious thing, and just shows how the blood will show out, I found
out afterwards that Sir Henry Curtis, for that was the big man's name,
was of Danish blood. He also reminded me strongly of somebody else, but
at the time I could not remember who it was.

<P>&nbsp;The other man, who stood talking to Sir Henry, was short, stout,
and dark, and of quite a different cut. I suspected at once that he was
a naval officer. I don't know why, but it is difficult to mistake a navy
man. I have gone shooting trips with several of them in the course of my
life, and they have always been just the best and bravest and nicest fellows
I ever met, though given to the use of profane language.

<P>&nbsp;I asked, a page or two back, what is a gentleman? I'll answer
it now: a royal naval officer is, in a general sort of a way, though, of
course, there may be a black sheep among them here and there. I fancy it
is just the wide sea and the breath of God's winds that washes their hearts
and blows the bitterness out of their minds and makes them what men ought
to be. Well, to return, I was right again; I found out that he <I>was</I>
a naval officer, a lieutenant of thirty-one, who, after seventeen years
service, had been turned out of her majesty s employ with the barren honor
of a commander's rank, because it was impossible that he should be promoted.
This is what people who serve the queen have to expect: to be shot out
into the cold world to find a living just when they are beginning to really
understand their work, and to get to the prime of life. Well, I suppose
they don t mind it, but for my part I had rather earn my bread as a hunter.
One's half-pence are as scarce, perhaps, but you don t get so many kicks.
His name I found out - by referring to the passengers' list - was Good
- Captain John Good. He was broad, of medium height, dark, stout, and rather
a curious man to look at. He was so very neat and so very clean shaved,
and he always wore an eye-glass in his right eye. It seemed to grow there,
for it had no string, and he never took it out except to wipe it. At first
I thought he used to sleep in it, but I afterwards found that this was
a mistake. He put it in his trousers pocket when he went to bed, together
with his false teeth, of which he had two beautiful sets that have often,
my own being none of the best, caused me to break the tenth Commandment.
But I am anticipating.

<P>&nbsp;Soon after we had got under way evening closed in, and brought
with it very dirty weather. A keen breeze sprang up off land, and a kind
of aggravated Scotch mist soon drove everybody from the deck. And as for
that <I>Dunkeld</I>, she is a flat-bottomed punt, and, going up light as
she was, she rolled very heavily. It almost seemed as though she would
go right over, but she never did. It was quite impossible to walk about,
so I stood near the engines, where it was warm, and amused myself with
watching the pendulum, which was fixed opposite to me, swinging slowly
backward and forward as the vessel rolled, and marking the angle she touched
at each lurch.

<P>&nbsp;"That pendulum's wrong; it is not properly weighted," suddenly
said a voice at my shoulder, somewhat testily. Looking round I saw the
naval officer I had noticed when the passengers came aboard.

<P>&nbsp;"Indeed; now what makes you think so?" I asked.

<P>&nbsp;"Think so. I don't think at all. Why there" as she righted herself
after a roll - "if the ship had really rolled to the degree that thing
pointed to then she would never have rolled again, that's all. But it is
just like these merchant skippers, they always are so confoundedly careless."

<P>&nbsp;Just then the dinner-bell rang, and I was not sorry, far it is
a dreadful thing to have to listen to an officer of the Royal Navy when
he gets on to that subject. I only know one worse thing, and that is to
hear a merchant skipper express his candid opinion of officers of the Royal
Navy.

<P>&nbsp;Captain Good and I went down to dinner together, and there we
found Sir Henry Curtis already seated. He and Captain Good sat together,
and I sat opposite to them. The captain and I soon got into talk about
shooting and what not, he asking me many questions, and I answering as
well as I could. Presently he got on to elephants.

<P>&nbsp;"Ah, sir," called out somebody who was sitting near me, "you've
got to the right man for that; Hunter Quatermain should be able to tell
you about elephants if anybody can."

<P>&nbsp;Sir Henry, who had been sitting quite quiet listening to our talk,
started visibly.

<P>&nbsp;"Excuse me, sir," he said, leaning forward across the table, and
speaking in a low, deep voice, a very suitable voice, it seemed to me,
to come out of those great lungs. "Excuse me, sir, but is your name Allan
Quatermain?"

<P>&nbsp;I said it was.

<P>&nbsp;The big man made no further remark, but I heard him mutter "fortunate"
into his beard.

<P>&nbsp;Presently dinner came to an end, and as we were leaving the saloon
Sir Henry came up and asked me if I would come into his cabin and smoke
a pipe. I accepted, and he led the way to the <I>Dunkeld</I> deck cabin,
and a very good cabin it was. It had been two cabins, but when Sir Garnet,
or one of those big swells, went down the coast in the <I>Dunkeld</I> they
had knocked away the partition and never put it up again. There was a sofa
in the cabin, and a little table in front of it. Sir Henry sent the steward
for a bottle of whiskey, and the three of us sat down and lit our pipes.

<P>&nbsp;"Mr. Quatermain," said Sir Henry Curtis, when the steward had
brought the whiskey and lit the lamp, "the year before last, about this
time, you were, I believe, at a place called Bamangwato, to the north of
the Transvaal."

<P>&nbsp;"I was," I answered, rather surprised that this gentleman should
be so well acquainted with my movements, which were not, so far as I was
aware, considered of general interest.

<P>&nbsp;"You were trading there, were you not?" put in Captain Good, in
his quick way.

<P>&nbsp;"I was. I took up a wagon-load of goods and made a camp outside
the settlement, and stopped till I had sold them."

<P>&nbsp;Sir Henry was sitting opposite to me in a Madeira chair, his arms
leaning on the table. He now looked up, fixing his large gray eyes full
upon my face. There was a curious anxiety in them, I thought.

<P>&nbsp;"Did you happen to meet a man called Neville there?"

<P>&nbsp;"Oh, yes; he outspanned alongside of me for a fortnight, to rest
his oxen before going on to the interior. I had a letter from a lawyer,
a few months back, asking me if I knew what had become of him, which I
answered to the best of my ability at the time."

<P>&nbsp;"Yes," said Sir Henry, "your letter was forwarded to me. You said
in it that the gentleman called Neville left Bamangwato in the beginning
of May, in a wagon, with a driver, a voorlooper, and a Kaffir hunter called
Jim, announcing his intention of trekking, if possible, as far as Inyati,
the extreme trading post in the Matabele country, where he would sell his
wagon and proceed on foot. You also said that he did sell his wagon, for,
six months afterwards, you saw the wagon in the possession of a Portuguese
trader, who told you that he had bought it at Inyati from a white man whose
name he had forgotten, and that the white man, with a native servant, had
started off for the interior on a shooting trip, he believed."

<P>&nbsp;"Yes."

<P>&nbsp;Then came a pause.

<P>&nbsp;"Mr. Quatermain," said Sir Henry, suddenly, "I suppose you know
or can guess nothing more of the reasons of my- - of Mr. Neville's journey
to the northward, or as to what point that journey was directed?"

<P>&nbsp;"I heard something," I answered, and stopped. The subject was
one which I did not dare to discuss.

<P>&nbsp;Sir Henry and Captain Good looked at each other, and Captain Good
nodded.

<P>&nbsp;"Mr. Quatermain," said the former, "I am going to tell you a story,
and ask your advice, and perhaps your assistance. The agent who forwarded
me your letter told me that I might implicitly rely upon it, as you were,"
he said, "well known and universally respected in Natal, and especially
noted for your discretion."

<P>&nbsp;I bowed, and drank some whiskey-and-water to hide my confusion,
for I am a modest man; and Sir Henry went on.

<P>&nbsp;"Mr. Neville was my brother."

<P>&nbsp;"Oh," I said, starting; for now I knew who Sir Henry had reminded
me of when I first saw. him. His brother was a much smaller man and had
a dark beard, but, now I thought of it, he possessed eyes of the same shade
of gray and with the same keen look in them, and the features, too, were
not unlike.

<P>&nbsp;"He was," went on Sir Henry, "my only and younger brother, and
till five years ago I do not suppose we were ever a month away from each
other. But just about five years ago a misfortune befell us, as sometimes
does happen in families. We had quarrelled bitterly, and I behaved very
unjustly to my brother in my anger." Here Captain Good nodded his head
vigorously to himself. The ship gave a big roll just then, so that the
looking-glass, which was fixed opposite us to starboard, was for a moment
nearly over our heads, and as I was sitting with my hands in my pockets
and staring upward, I could see him nodding like anything.

<P>&nbsp;"As I dare say you know," went on Sir Henry, "if a man dies intestate,
and has no property but land - real property it is called in England -
it all descends to his eldest son. It so happened that just at the time
when we quarrelled our father died intestate. He had put off making his
will until it was too late. The result was that my brother, who had not
been brought up to any profession, was left without a penny. Of course
it would have been my duty to provide for him, but at the time the quarrel
between us was so bitter that I did not - to my shame I say it (and he
sighed deeply) - -offer to do anything. It was not that I grudged him anything,
but I waited for him to make advances, and he made none. I am sorry to
trouble you with all this, Mr. Quatermain, but I must, to make things clear;
eh, Good?

<P>&nbsp;"Quite so, quite so," said the captain. "Mr. Quatermain will,
I am sure, keep this history to himself."

<P>&nbsp;"Of course," said I, for I rather pride myself on my discretion.

<P>&nbsp;"Well," went on Sir Henry, "my brother had a few hundred pounds
to his account at the time, and without saying anything to me he drew out
this paltry sum, and, having adopted the name of Neville, started off for
South Africa in the wild hope of making a fortune. This I heard afterwards.
Some three years passed, and I heard. nothing of my brother, though I wrote
several times. Doubtless the letters never reached him. But as time went
on I grew more and more troubled about him. I found out, Mr. Quatermain,
that blood is thicker than water."

<P>&nbsp;"That's true," said I, thinking of my boy Harry.

<P>&nbsp;"I found out, Mr. Quatermain, that I would have given half my
fortune to know that my brother George, the only relation I have, was safe
and well, and that I should see him again."

<P>&nbsp;"But you never did, Curtis," jerked out Captain Good, glancing
at the big man's face.

<P>&nbsp;"Well, Mr. Quatermain, as time went on I became more and more
anxious to find out if my brother was alive or dead, and, if alive, to
get him home again. I set inquiries on foot, and your letter was one of
the results. So far as it went it was satisfactory, for it showed that
till lately George was alive; but it did not go far enough. So, to cut
a long story short, I made up my mind to come out and look for him myself,
and Captain Good was so kind as to come with me."

<P>&nbsp;"Yes," said the captain; "nothing else to do, you see. Turned
out by my lords of the admiralty to starve on half-pay. And now, perhaps,
sir, you will tell us what you know or have heard of the gentleman called
Neville."
