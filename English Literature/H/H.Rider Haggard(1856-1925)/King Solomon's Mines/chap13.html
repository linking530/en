CHAPTER XIII</H2>

<H3>
THE ATTACK</H3>
Slowly, and without the slightest appearance of haste or excitement, the
three columns crept on. When within about five hundred yards of us, the
main or centre column halted at the root of a tongue of open plain which
ran up into the hill, to enable the other two to circumvent our position,
which was shaped more or less in the form of a horseshoe, the two points
being towards the town of too, their object being, no doubt, that the threefold
assault should be delivered simultaneously.

<P>&nbsp;"Oh, for a gatling!" groaned Good, as he contemplated the serried
phalanxes beneath us. "I would clear the plain in twenty minutes.

<P>&nbsp;"We have not got one, so it is no use yearning for it; but suppose
you try a shot, Quatermain; see how near you can go to that tall fellow
who appears to be in command. Two to one you miss him, and an even sovereign,
to be honestly paid if ever we get out of this, that you don't drop the
ball within ten yards."

<P>&nbsp;This piqued me, so, loading the express with solid ball, I waited
till my friend walked some ten yards out from his force, in order to get
a better view of our position, accompanied only by an orderly, and then
lying down and resting the express upon a rock, I covered him. The rifle,
like all expresses, was only sighted to three hundred and fifty yards,
so, to allow for the drop in trajectory, took him half-way down the neck,
which ought, I calculated, to find him in the chest. He stood quite still
and gave me every opportunity, but whether it was the excitement or the
wind, or the fact of the man being a long shot, I don't know, but this
was what happened. Getting dead on, as I thought, a fine sight, I pressed,
and when the puff of smoke had cleared away I, to my disgust, saw my man
standing unharmed, while his orderly, who was at least three paces to the
left, was stretched upon the ground, apparently dead. Turning swiftly,
the officer I had aimed at began to run towards his force, in evident alarm.

<P>&nbsp;"Bravo, Quatermain!" sang out Good; "you've frightened him."

<P>&nbsp;This made me very angry, for if possible to avoid it, I hate to
miss in public. When one can only do one thing well, one likes to keep
up one's reputation in that thing. Moved quite out of myself at my failure,
I did a rash thing. Rapidly covering the general as he ran, I let drive
with the second barrel. The poor man threw up his arms and fell forward
on his face. This time I had made no mistake; and - I say it as a proof
of how little we think of others when our own pride or reputation are in
question - I was brute enough to feel delighted at the sight.

<P>&nbsp;The regiments who had seen the feat cheered wildly at this exhibition
of the white man's magic, which they took as an omen of success, while
the force to which the general had belonged - which, indeed, as we afterwards
ascertained, he had commanded - began to fall back in confusion. Sir Henry
and Good now took up their rifles and began to fire, the latter industriously
"browning" the dense mass before him with a Winchester repeater, and I
also had another shot or two, with the result that, so far as we could
judge, we put some eight or ten men <I>h&ocirc;rs de combat</I> before
they got out of range.

<P>&nbsp;Just as we stopped firing there came an ominous roar from our
far right, then a similar roar from our left. The two other divisions were
engaging us.

<P>&nbsp;At the sound the mass of men before us opened out a little, and
came on towards the hill up the spit of bare grass-land at a slow trot,
singing a deep throated song as they advanced. We kept up a steady fire
from our rifles as they came, Ignosi joining in occasionally, and accounted
for several men, but of course produced no more effect upon that mighty
rush of armed humanity than he who throws pebbles does on the advancing
wave.

<P>&nbsp;On they came, with a shout and the clashing of spears; now they
were driving in the outposts we had placed among the rocks at the foot
of the hill. After that the advance was a little slower, for though as
yet we had offered no serious opposition, the attacking force had to come
up hill, and came slowly to save their breath. Our first line of defence
was about half-way up the side, our second fifty yards farther back, while
our third occupied the edge of the plain.

<P>&nbsp;On they came, shouting their war-

<P>&nbsp;<I>Twala! Twala! Chiel&eacute;! Chiel&eacute;!</I> (Twala! Twala!
Smite! smite!). <I>"Ignosi! Ignosi! Chiel&eacute;! Chiel&eacute;!</I>"
answered our people. They were quite close now, and the tollas, or throwing
knives, began to flash backward and forward, and now with an awful yell
the battle closed in.

<P>&nbsp;To and fro swayed the mass of struggling warriors, men falling
thick as leaves in an autumn wind; but before long the superior weight
of the attacking force began to tell, and our first line of defence was
slowly pressed back, till it merged into the second. Here the struggle
was very fierce, but again our people were driven back and up, till at
length, within twenty minutes of the commencement of the fight, our third
line came into action.

<P>&nbsp;But by this time the assailants were much exhausted, and had,
besides, lost many men killed and wounded, and to break through that third
impenetrable hedge of spears proved beyond their powers. For a while the
dense mass of struggling warriors swung backward and forward in the fierce
ebb and flow of battle, and the issue was doubtful. Sir Henry watched the
desperate struggle with a kindling eye, and then without a word he rushed
off, followed by Good, and flung himself into the hottest of the fray.
As for myself, I stopped where I was.

<P>&nbsp;The soldiers caught sight of his tall form as he plunged into
the battle, and there rose a cry of -

<P>"Nanzig Incubu!" (Here is the Elephant! ) <I>"Chiel&eacute;! Chiel&eacute;!</I>

<P>&nbsp;From that moment the issue was no longer in doubt. Inch by inch,
fighting with desperate gallantry, the attacking force was pressed hack
down the hillside, till at last it retreated upon its reserves in something
like confusion. At that moment, too, a messenger arrived to say that the
left attack had been repulsed, and I was just beginning to congratulate
myself that the affair was over for the present, when, to our horror, we
perceived our men who had been engaged in the right defence being driven
towards us across the plain, followed by swarms of the enemy, who had evidently
succeeded at this point.

<P>&nbsp;Ignosi, who was standing by me, took in the situation at a glance,
and issued a rapid order. Instantly the reserve regiment round us (the
Grays) extended itself.

<P>&nbsp;Again Ignosi gave a word of command, which was taken up and repeated
by the captains, and in another second, to my intense disgust, I found
myself involved in a furious onslaught upon the advancing foe. Getting
as much as I could behind Ignosi's huge frame, I made the best of a bad
job, and toddled along to be killed, as though I liked it. In a minute
or two - the time seemed all too short to me - we were plunging through
the flying groups of our men, who at once began to re-form behind us, and
then I am sure I do not know what happened. All I can remember is a dreadful
rolling noise of the meeting of shields, and the sudden apparition of a
huge ruffian, whose eyes seemed literally to be starting out of his head,
making straight at me with a bloody spear. But - I say it with pride -
-I rose to the occasion. It was an occasion before which most people would
have collapsed once and for all. Seeing that if I stood where I was I must
be done for, I - as the horrid apparition came, flung myself down in front
of him - so cleverly that, being unable to stop himself, he took a header
right over my prostrate form. Before he could rise again I had risen and
settled the matter from behind with my revolver.

<P>&nbsp;Shortly after this somebody knocked me down, and I remember no
more of the charge.

<P>&nbsp;When I came to I found myself back at the koppie, with Good bending
over me with some water in a gourd.

<P>&nbsp;"How do you feel, old fellow?" he asked, anxiously.

<P>&nbsp;I got up and shook myself before answering.

<P>&nbsp;"Pretty well, thank you," I answered.

<P>&nbsp;"Thank Heaven! when I saw them carry you in I felt quite sick;
I thought you were done for."

<P>&nbsp;"Not this time, my boy. I fancy I only got a rap on the head,
which knocked me out of time. How has it ended?"

<P>&nbsp;"They are repulsed at every point for the time. The loss is dreadfully
heavy; we have lost quite two thousand killed and wounded, and they must
have lost three. Look, there's a sight!" and he pointed to long lines of
men advancing by fours. In the centre of, and being borne by, each group
of four was a kind of hide tray, of which a Kukuana force always carried
a quantity, with a loop for a handle at each corner. On these trays - and
their number seemed endless - lay wounded men, who as they arrived were
hastily examined by the medicine-men, of whom ten were attached to each
regiment. If the wound was not of a fatal character, the sufferer was taken
away and attended to as carefully as circumstances would allow. But if,
on the other hand, the wounded man's condition was hopeless, what followed
was very dreadful, though doubtless it was the truest mercy. One of the
doctors, under pretence of carrying out an examination, swiftly opened
an artery with a sharp knife, and in a minute or two the sufferer expired
painlessly. There were many cases that day in which this was done. In fact,
it was done in most cases when the wound was in the body, for the gash
made by the entry of the enormously broad spears used by the Kukuanas generally
rendered recovery hopeless. In most cases the sufferers were already tin,
conscious, and in others the fatal "nick" of the artery was done so swiftly
and painlessly that they did not seem to notice it. Still it was a ghastly
sight, and one from which we were glad to escape; indeed, I never remember
one which affected me more than seeing those gallant soldiers thus put
out of pain by the red-handed medicine-men, except, indeed, on an occasion
when, after an attack, I saw a force of Swazis burying their hopelessly
wounded <I>alive</I>.

<P>&nbsp;Hurrying from this dreadful scene to the farther side of the koppie,
we found Sir Henry (who still held a bloody battle-axe in his hand), Ignosi,
Infadoos, and one or two of the chiefs in deep consultation.

<P>&nbsp;"Thank heavens, here you are, Quatermain! I can't make out what
Ignosi wants to do. It seems that, though we have beaten off the attack,
Twala is now receiving large reinforcements, and is showing a disposition
to invest us, with a view of starving us out."

<P>&nbsp;"That's awkward."

<P>&nbsp;"yes; especially as Infadoos says that the water supply has given
out."

<P>&nbsp;"My lord, that is so," said Infadoos; "the spring cannot supply
the wants of so great a multitude, and is failing rapidly. Before night
we shall all be thirsty. Listen, Macumazahn - Thou art wise, and hast doubtless
seen many wars in the lands from whence thou camest - that is if, indeed,
- they make wars in the stars. Now tell us, what shall we do? Twala has
brought up many fresh men to take the place of those who have fallen. But
Twala has learned a lesson; the hawk did not think to find the heron ready;
but our beak has pierced his breast; he will not strike at us again. We,
too, are wounded, and he will wait for us to die; he will wind himself
round us like a snake round a buck, and fight the fight of sit down."

<P>&nbsp;"I hear you," I said.

<P>&nbsp;"So, Macumazahn, thou seest we have no water here, and but a little
food, and we must choose between these three things - to languish like
a starving lion in his den, or to strive to break away towards the north,
or" - and here he rose and pointed towards the dense mass of our foes -
"to launch ourselves straight at Twala's throat. Incubu, the great warrior
- for to-day he fought like a buffalo in a net, and Twala's soldiers went
down before his axe like corn before the hail; with these eyes I saw it
- Incubu says `charge'; but the Elephant is ever prone to charge. Now what
says Macumazahn, the wily old fox, who has seen much and loves to bite
his enemy from behind? The last word is in Ignosi, the king, for it is
a king's right to speak of war; but let us hear thy voice, O Macumazahn,
who watchest by night, and the voice too of him of the transparent eye."

<P>&nbsp;"What sayest thou, Ignosi?"' I asked.

<P>&nbsp;"Nay, my father," answered our quondam servant, who now, clad
as he was in the full panoply of savage war, looked every inch a warrior
king, "do thou speak, and let me, who am but a child in wisdom beside thee,
hearken to thy words."

<P>&nbsp;Thus abjured, I, after taking hasty counsel with Good and Sir
Henry, delivered my opinion briefly to the effect that, being trapped,
our best chance, especially in view of the failure of our water supply,
was to initiate an attack upon Twala's forces, and then I recommended that
the attack should be delivered at once, "before our wounds grew stiff,"
and also before the sight of Twala's overpowering force caused the hearts
of our soldiers "to wax small like fat before a fire." Otherwise, I pointed
out, some of the captains might change their minds, and, making peace with
Twala, desert to him, or even betray us into his hands.

<P>&nbsp;This expression of opinion seemed, on the whole, to be favorably
received; indeed, among the Kukuanas my utterances met with a respect which
has never been accorded to them before or since. But the real decision
as to our course lay with Ignosi, who, since he had been recognized as
rightful king, could exercise the almost unbounded rights of sovereignty,
including, of course, the final decision on matters of generalship, and
it was to him that all eyes were now turned.

<P>&nbsp;At length, after a pause, during which he appeared to be thinking
deeply, he spoke:

<P>&nbsp;"Incubu, Macumazahn, and Bougwan, brave white men, and my friends;
Infadoos, my uncle, and chiefs; my heart is fixed. I will strike at Twala
this day, and set my fortunes on the blow, ay, and my life; my life and
your lives also. Listen: thus will I strike. Ye see how the hill curves
round like the half-moon, and how the plain runs like a green tongue towards
us within the curve?"

<P>&nbsp;"We see," I answered.

<P>&nbsp;"Good; it is now midday, and the men eat and rest after the toil
of battle. When the sun has turned and travelled a little way towards the
dark, let thy regiment, my uncle, advance with one other down to the green
tongue. And it shall be that when Twala sees it he shall hurl his force
at it to crush it. But the spot is narrow, and the regiments can come against
thee one at a time only; so shall they be destroyed one by one, and the
eyes of all Twala's army shall be fixed upon a struggle the like of which
has not been seen by living man. And with thee, my uncle, shall go Incubu,
my friend, that when Twala sees his battle-axe flashing in the first rank
of the `Grays' his heart may grow faint. And I will come with the second
regiment, that which follows thee, so that if ye are destroyed, as it may
happen, there may yet be a king left to fight for; and with me shall come
Macumazahn the wise."

<P>&nbsp;"It is well, O King," said Infadoos, apparently contemplating
the certainty of the complete annihilation of his regiment with perfect
calmness. Truly these Kukuanas are a wonderful people. Death has no terrors
for them when it is incurred in the course of duty.

<P>&nbsp;"And while the eyes of the multitude of Twala's regiments are
thus fixed upon the fight," went on Ignosi, "behold, one third of the men
who are left alive to us" (i.e., about six thousand) "shall creep along
the right horn of the hill and fall upon the left flank of Twala's force,
and one third shall creep along the left horn and fall upon Twala's right
flank. And when I see that the horns are ready to toss Twala, then will
I, with the men who are left to me, charge home in Twala's face, and if
fortune goes with us the day will be ours, and before Night drives her
horses from the mountains to the mountains we shall sit in peace at Loo.
And now let us. eat and make ready; and, Infadoos, do thou prepare, that
the plan be carried out; and stay, let my white father, Bougwan go with
the right horn, that his shining eye may give courage to the men."

<P>&nbsp;The arrangements for the attack thus briefly indicated were set
in motion with a rapidity that spoke well for the perfection of the Kukuana
military system. Within little more than an hour rations had been served
out to the men and devoured, the three divisions were formed, the plan
of attack explained to the leaders, and the whole force, with the exception
of a guard left with the wounded, now numbering about eighteen thousand
men in all, was ready to be put in motion.

<P>&nbsp;Presently Good came up and shook hands with Sir Henry and myself.

<P>&nbsp;"Good-bye, you fellows," he said, "I am off with the right wing,
according to orders; and so I have come to shake hands in case we should
not meet again, you know," he added, significantly/

<P>&nbsp;We shook hands in silence, and not without the exhibition of as
much emotion as Englishmen are wont to show.

<P>&nbsp;"It is a queer business," said Sir Henry, his deep voice shaking
a little, "and I confess I never expect to see to-morrow's sun. As far
as I can make out, the Grays, with whom I am to go, are to fight until
they are wiped out in order to enable the wings to slip round unawares
and outflank Twala. Well, so be it; at any rate, it will be a man's death!
Good-bye, old fellow. God bless you! I hope you will pull through and live
to collar the diamonds; but if you do, take my advice and don't have anything
more to do with pretenders!"

<P>&nbsp;In another second Good had wrung us both by the hand and gone;
and then Infadoos came up and led off Sir Henry to his place in the forefront
of the Grays, while, with many misgivings, I departed with Ignosi to my
station in the second attacking regiment.
