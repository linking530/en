CHAPTER XVI</H2>

<H3>
THE PLACE OF DEATH</H3>
IT was already dark on the third day after the scene described in the previous
chapter, when we camped in some huts at the foot of the "Three Witches,"
as the triangle of mountains was called to which Solomon's Great Road ran.
Our party consisted of our three selves and Foulata, who waited on us -
-especially on Good - Infadoos, Gagool, who was borne along in a litter,
inside which she could be heard muttering and cursing all day long, and
a party of guards and attendants. The mountains, or rather the three peaks
of the mountains, for the whole mass evidently consisted of a solitary
upheaval, were, as I have said, in the form of a triangle, of which the
base was towards us, one peak being on our right, one on our left, and
one straight in front of us. Never shall I forget the sight afforded by
those three towering peaks in the early sunlight of the following morning.
High, high above us, up into the blue air, soared their twisted snow-wreaths.
Beneath the snow the peaks were purple with heath, and so were the wild
moors that ran up the slopes towards them. Straight before us the white
ribbon of Solomon's Great Road stretched away up-hill to the foot of the
centre peak, about five miles from us, and then stopped. It was its terminus.

<P>&nbsp;I had better leave the feelings of intense excitement with which
we set out on our march that morning to the imagination of those who read
this history. At last we were drawing near to the wonderful mines that
had been the cause of the miserable death of the old Portuguese don, three
centuries ago, of my poor friend, his ill-starred descendant, and also,
as we feared, of George Curtis, Sir Henry's brother. Were we destined,
after all that we had gone through, to fare any better? Evil befell them,
as that old fiend, Gagool, said; would it also befall us? Somehow, as we
were marching up that last stretch of beautiful road, I could not help
feeling a little superstitious about the matter, and so, I think, did Good
and Sir Henry.

<P>&nbsp;For an hour and a half or more we tramped on up the heather-fringed
road, going so fast in our excitement that the bearers with Gagool's hammock
could scarcely keep pace with us, and its occupant piped out to us to stop.

<P>&nbsp;"Go more slowly, white men," she said, projecting her hideous,
shrivelled countenance between the curtains, and fixing her gleaming eyes
upon us; "why will ye run to meet the evil that shall befall ye, ye seekers
after treasure?" and she laughed that horrible laugh which always sent
a cold shiver down my back, and which for a while quite took the enthusiasm
out of us.

<P>&nbsp;However, on we went, till we saw before us, and between ourselves
and the peak, a vast circular hole with sloping sides, three hundred feet
or more in depth, and quite half a mile round.

<P>&nbsp;"Can't you guess what this is?" I said to Sir Henry and Good,
who were staring in astonishment down into the awful pit before us.

<P>&nbsp;They shook their heads.

<P>&nbsp;"Then it is clear that you have never seen the diamond mines at
Kimberley. You may depend on it that this is Solomon's diamond mine; look
there," I said, pointing to the stiff blue clay which was yet to be seen
among the grass and bushes which clothed the sides of the pit, "the formation
is the same. I'll be bound that if we went down there we should find `pipes'
of soapy, brecciated rock. Look, too," and I pointed to a series of worn,
flat slabs of rock which were placed on a gentle slope below the level
of a watercourse which had in some past age been cut out of the solid rock;
"if those are not tables once used to wash the `stuff,' I'm a Dutchman."

<P>&nbsp;At the edge of this vast hole, which was the pit marked on the
old don's map, the great road branched into two and circumvented it. In
many places this circumventing road was built entirely of vast blocks of
stone, apparently with the object of supporting the edges of the pit and
preventing falls of reef. Along this road we pressed, driven by curiosity
to see what the three towering objects were which we could discern from
the hither side of the great hole. As we got nearer we perceived that they
were colossi of some sort or another, and rightly conjectured that these
were the three "Silent Ones" that were held in such awe by the Kukuana
people. But it was not until we got quite close that we recognized the
full majesty of these "Silent Ones."

<P>&nbsp;There, upon huge pedestals of dark rock, sculptured in unknown
characters, twenty paces between each; and looking down the road which
crossed some sixty miles of plain to Loo, were three colossal seated forms
- two males and one female - each measuring about twenty feet from the
crown of the head to the pedestal.

<P>&nbsp;The female form which was nude, was of great though severe beauty,
but unfortunately the features were injured by centuries of exposure to
the weather. Rising from each side of her head were the points of a crescent.
The two male colossi were, on the contrary, draped, and presented a terrifying
cast of features, especially the one to. our right, which had the face
of a devil. That to our left was serene in countenance, but the calm upon
it was dreadful. It was the calm of inhuman cruelty, the cruelty, Sir Henry
remarked, that the ancients attributed to beings potent for good, who could
yet watch the sufferings of humanity, if not with rejoicing, at least without
suffering themselves. The three formed a most awe-inspiring trinity, as
they sat there in their solitude and gazed out across the plain forever.
Contemplating these "Silent Ones," as the Kukuanas called them, an intense
curiosity again seized us to know whose were the hands that had shaped
them, who was it that had dug the pit and made the road. While I was gazing
and wondering, it suddenly occurred to me (being familiar with the Old
Testament) that Solomon went astray after strange gods, the names of three
of whom I remembered - "Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidovians, Chemosh
the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon" -
-and I suggested to my companions that the three figures before us might
represent these false divinities.

<P>&nbsp;"Hum," said Sir Henry, who was a scholar, having taken a high
degree in classics at college, "there may be something in that; Ashtoreth
of the Hebrews was the Astarte of the Phoenicians, who were the great traders
of Solomon's time. Astarte, who afterwards was the Aphrodite of the Greeks,
was represented with horns like the half-moon, and there on the brow of
the female figure are distinct horns. Perhaps these colossi were designed
by some Phoenician official who managed the mines. Who can say?"

<P>&nbsp;Before we had finished examining these extraordinary relics of
remote antiquity, Infadoos came up, and, having saluted the "Silent Ones"
by lifting his spear, asked us if we intended entering the "Place of Death"
at once, or if we would wait till after we had taken food at midday. If
we were ready to go at once, Gagool had announced her willingness to guide
us. As it was not more than eleven o'clock, we - driven to it by a burning
curiosity - announced our intention of proceeding at once, and I suggested
that, in case we should be detained in the cave, we should take some food
with us. Accordingly Gagool's litter was brought up, and that lady herself
assisted out of it; and meanwhile Foulata, at my request, stored some biltong,
or dried game flesh, together with a couple of gourds of water in a reed
basket. Straight in front of us, at a distance of some fifty paces from
the hacks of the colossi, rose a sheer wall of rock, eighty feet or more
in height, that gradually sloped up till it formed the base of the lofty
snow wreathed peak which soared up into the air three thousand feet above
us. As soon as she was clear of her hammock Gagool cast one evil grin upon
us, and then, leaning on a stick, hobbled off towards the sheer face of
the rock. We followed her till we came to a narrow portal solidly arched,
that looked like the opening of a gallery of a mine.

<P>&nbsp;Here Gagool was waiting for us, still with that evil grin upon
her horrid face.

<P>&nbsp;"Now, white men from the stars," she piped; "great warriors, Incubu,
Bougwan, and Macumazahn the wise, are ye ready? Behold, I am here to do
the bidding of my lord the king, and to show ye the store of bright stones."

<P>&nbsp;"We are ready," I said.

<P>&nbsp;"Good! good! Make strong your hearts to bear what ye shall see.
Comes, thou too, Infadoos, who betrayed thy master?"

<P>&nbsp;Infadoos frowned as he answered: "Nay, I come not; it is not for
me to enter there. But thou, Gagool, curb thy tongue, and beware how thou
dealest with my lords. At thy hands will I require them, and if a hair
of them be hurt, Gagool, be thou fifty times a witch, thou shalt die. Hearest,
thou?"

<P>&nbsp;"I hear, Infadoos; I know thee, thou didst ever love big words;
when thou wast a babe I remember thou didst threaten thine own mother.
That was but the other day. But fear not, fear not; I live but to do the
bidding of the king. I have done the bidding of many kings, Infadoos, till
in the end they did mine. Ha! ha! I go to look upon their faces once more,
and Twala's, too! Come on, come on, here is the lamp," and she drew a great
gourd full of off, and fitted with a rush wick, from under her fur cloak.

<P>&nbsp;"Art thou coming, Foulata?" asked Good in his villainous kitchen
Kukuana in which he had been improving himself under that lady's tuition.

<P>&nbsp;"I fear, my lord," the girl answered, timidly.

<P>&nbsp;"Then give me the basket."

<P>&nbsp;"Nay, my lord, whither thou goest, there will I go also."

<P>&nbsp;"The deuce you will" thought I to myself; "that will be rather
awkward if ever we get out of this."

<P>&nbsp;Without further ado Gagool plunged into the passage, which was
wide enough to admit of two walking abreast, and quite dark, we following
her voice as she piped to us to come on, in some fear and trembling, which
was not allayed by the sound of a sudden rush of wings.

<P>&nbsp;"Hallo! what's that?" hallooed Good; "somebody hit me in the face."

<P>&nbsp;"Bats," said I; "'on you go."

<P>&nbsp;When we had, as far as we could judge, gone some fifty paces we
perceived that the passage was growing faintly light. Another minute, and
we stood in the most wonderful place that the eyes of living man ever lit
on.

<P>&nbsp;Let the reader picture to himself the hail of the vastest cathedral
he ever stood in, windowless, indeed, but dimly lighted from above (presumably
by shafts connected with the outer air and driven in the roof, which arched
away a hundred feet above our heads), and he will get some idea of the
size of the enormous cave in which we stood, with the difference that this
cathedral designed of nature was loftier and wider than any built by man.
But its stupendous size was the least of the wonders of the place, for,
running in rows down its length were gigantic pillars of what looked like
ice, but were, in reality, huge stalactites. It is impossible for me to
convey any idea of the overpowering beauty and grandeur of these pillars
of white spar, some of which were not less than twenty feet in diameter
at the base, and sprang up in lofty and yet delicate beauty sheer to the
distant roof. Others again were in process of formation. On the rock floor
there was in these cases what looked, Sir Henry said, exactly like a broken
column in an old Grecian temple, while high above, depending from the roof,
the point of a huge icicle could be dimly seen. And even as we gazed we
could hear the process going on, for presently with a tiny splash a drop
of water would fall from the far-off icicle on to the column below. On
some columns the drops only fell once in two or three minutes, and in these
cases it would form an interesting calculation to discover how long, at
that rate of dripping, it would take to form a pillar, say eighty feet
high by ten in diameter. That the process was, in at least one instance,
incalculably slow, the following instance will suffice to show. Cut on
one of these pillars we discovered a rude likeness of a mummy, by the head
of which sat what appeared to be one of the Egyptian gods, doubtless the
handiwork of some old-world laborer in the mine. This work of art was executed
at about the natural height at which an idle fellow, be he Phoenician workman
or British cad, is in the habit of trying to immortalize himself at the
expense of nature's masterpieces, namely, about five feet from the ground;
yet at the time that we saw it, which <I>must</I> have been nearly three
thousand years after the date of the execution of the drawing, the column
was only eight feet high, and was still in process of formation, which
gives a rate of growth of a foot to a thousand years, or an inch and a
fraction to a century. This we knew because, as we were standing by it,
we heard a drop of water fall.

<P>&nbsp;Sometimes the stalactites took strange forms, presumably where
the dropping of the water had not always been on the same spot. Thus, one
huge mass, which must have weighed a hundred tons or so, was in the form
of a pulpit, beautifully fretted over outside with what looked like lace.
Others resembled strange beasts, and on the sides of the cave were fan-like
ivory tracings, such as the frost leaves upon a pane.

<P>&nbsp;Out of the vast main aisle there opened here and there smaller
caves, exactly, Sir Henry said, as chapels open out of great cathedrals.
Some were large, but one or two - -and this is a wonderful instance of
how Nature carries out her handiwork by the same unvarying laws, utterly
irrespective of size - were tiny. One little nook, for instance, was no
larger than an unusually big doll's house, and yet it might have been the
model of the whole place, for the water dropped, the tiny icicles hung,
and the spar columns were forming in just the same way.

<P>&nbsp;We had not time, however, to examine this beautiful place as thoroughly
as we should have liked to do, for unfortunately Gagool seemed to be indifferent
to stalactites, and only anxious to get her business over. This annoyed
me the more, as I was particularly anxious to discover, if possible, by
what system the light was admitted into the place, and whether it was by
the hand of man or of nature that this was done; also if it had been used
in any way in ancient times, as seemed probable. However, we consoled ourselves
with the idea that we would examine it thoroughly on our return, and followed
on after our uncanny guide.

<P>&nbsp;On she led us, straight to the top of the vast and silent cave,
where we found another doorway, not arched as the first was, but square
at the top, something like the doorways of Egyptian temples.

<P>&nbsp;"Are ye prepared to enter the Place of Death?" asked Gagool, evidently
with a view to making us feel uncomfortable.

<P>&nbsp;"Lead on, Macduff," said Good, solemnly, trying to look as though
he was not at all alarmed, as indeed did we all except Foulata, who caught
Good by the arm for protection.

<P>&nbsp;"This is getting rather ghastly," said Sir Henry, peeping into
the dark doorway. "Come on, Quatermain - <I>seniores priores</I>. Don't
keep the old lady waiting!" and he politely made way for me to lead the
van, for which I inwardly did not bless him.

<P>&nbsp;Tap, tap, went old Gagool's stick down the passage, as she trotted
along, chuckling hideously; and, still overcome by some unaccountable presentiment
of evil, I hung back.

<P>&nbsp;"Come, get on, old fellow," said Good, "or we shall lose our fair
guide."

<P>&nbsp;Thus adjured, I started down the passage, and after about twenty
paces found myself in a gloomy apartment some forty feet long by thirty
broad and thirty high, which in some past age had evidently been hollowed,
by hand-labor, out of the mountain. This apartment was not nearly so well
lighted as the vast stalactite ante-cave, and at the first glance all I
could make out was a massive stone table running its length, with a colossal
white figure at its head, and life-sized white figures all round it. Next
I made out a brown thing, seated on the table in the centre, and in another
moment my eyes grew accustomed to the light, and I saw what all these things
were, and I was tailing out of it as hard as my legs would carry me. I
am not a nervous man, in a general way, and very little troubled with superstitions,
of which I have lived to see the folly; but I am free to own that that
sight quite upset me, and had it not been that Sir Henry caught me by the
collar and held me, I do honestly believe that in another five minutes
I should have been outside that stalactite cave, and that the promise of
all the diamonds in Kimberley would not have induced me to enter it again.
But he held me tight, so I stopped because I could not help myself. But
next second his eyes got accustomed to the light, too, and he let go of
me and began to mop the perspiration off his forehead. As for Good, he
swore feebly, and Foulata threw her arms round his neck and shrieked.

<P>&nbsp;Only Gagool chuckled loud and long.

<P>&nbsp;It <I>was</I> a ghastly sight. There at the end of the long stone
table, holding in his skeleton fingers a great white spear, sat <I>Death</I>
himself, shaped in the form of a colossal human skeleton, fifteen feet
or more in height. High above his head he held the spear, as though in
the act of striking; one bony hand rested on the stone table before him,
in the position a man assumes on rising from his seat, while his frame
was bent forward so that the vertebrae of the neck and the grinning, gleaming
skull projected towards us and fixed its hollow eye-places upon us, the
jaws a little open, as though it were about to speak.

<P>&nbsp;"Great heavens!" said I, faintly, at last, "what can it be?"

<P>&nbsp;"And what are <I>those things</I>?" said Good, pointing to the
white company round the table.

<P>&nbsp;"And what on earth is <I>that thing</I>?" said Sir Henry, pointing
to the brown creature seated on the table.

<P>&nbsp;"Hee! hee! hee!" laughed Gagool. "To those who enter the Hall
of the Dead, evil comes. Hee! hee! hee! ha!"

<P>&nbsp;"Come, Incubu, brave in battle, come and see him thou slewest;"
and the old creature caught his coat in her skinny fingers, and led him
away towards the table. We followed.

<P>&nbsp;Presently she stopped and pointed at the brown object seated on
the table. Sir Henry looked, and started back with an exclamation; and
no wonder, for there, seated, quite naked, on the table, the head which
Sir Henry's battle-axe had shorn from the body resting on its knees, was
the gaunt corpse of Twala, last king of the Kukuanas. Yes, there, the head
perched upon the knees, it sat in all its ugliness, the vertebrae projecting
a full inch above the level of the shrunken flesh of the neck, for all
the world like a black double of Hamilton Tighe. Over the whole surface
of the corpse there was gathered a thin, glassy film, which made its appearance
yet more appalling and for which, we were, at the moment, quite unable
to account, till we presently observed that from the roof of the chamber
the water fell steadily, <I>drip! drip! drip!</I> onto the neck of the
corpse, from whence it ran down over the entire surface, and finally escaped
into the rock through a tiny hole in the table. Then I guessed what it
was - <I>Twala's body was being transformed into a stalactite</I>.

<P>&nbsp;A look at the white forms seated on the stone bench that ran around
that ghastly board confirmed this view. They were human forms, indeed,
or rather had been human forms; now they were <I>stalactites</I>. This
was the way in which the Kukuana people had from time immemorial preserved
their royal dead. They petrified them. What the exact system was, if there
was any beyond placing them for a. long period of years under the drip,
I never discovered, but there they sat iced over and preserved forever
by the silicious fluid. Anything more awe-inspiring than the spectacle
of this long line of departed royalties, wrapped in a shroud of ice-like
spar, through which the features could be dimly made out (there were twenty-seven
of them, the last being Ignosi's father), and seated round that inhospitable
board, with Death himself for a host, it is impossible to imagine. That
the practice of thus preserving their kings must have been an ancient one
is evident from the number, which, allowing for an average reign of fifteen
years, would, supposing that every king who reigned was placed here - an
improbable thing, as some are sure to have perished in battle far from
home - fix the date of its commencement at four and a quarter centuries
back. But the colossal. Death Who sits at the head of the board is far
older than that, and, unless I am much mistaken, owes his origin to the
same artist who designed the three colossi. He was hewn out of a single
stalactite, and, looked at as a work of art, was most admirably conceived
and executed. Good, who understood anatomy, declared that, so far as he
could see, the anatomical design of the skeleton was perfect down to the
smallest bones.

<P>&nbsp;My own idea is that this terrific object was a freak of fancy
on the part of some old-world sculptor, and that its presence had suggested
to the Kukuanas the idea of placing their royal dead under its awful presidency.
Or perhaps it was placed there to frighten away any marauders who might
have designs upon the treasure-chamber beyond. I cannot say. All I can
do is to describe it as it is, and the reader must form his own conclusion.

<P>&nbsp;Such, at any rate, was the white Death and such were the white
dead!
