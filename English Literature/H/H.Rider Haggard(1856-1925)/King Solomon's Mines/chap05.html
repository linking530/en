CHAPTER V</H2>

<H3>
OUR MARCH INTO THE DESERT</H3>
WE had killed nine elephants, and it took us two days to cut out the tusks
and get them home and bury them carefully in the sand under a large tree,
which made a conspicuous mark for miles round. It was a wonderfully fine
lot of ivory. I never saw a better, averaging as it did between forty and
fifty pounds a tusk. The tusks of the great bull that killed poor Khiva
scaled one hundred and seventy-pounds the pair, as nearly as we could judge.

<P>&nbsp;As for Khiva himself, we buried what remained of him in an ant-bear
hole, together with an assegai to protect himself with on his journey to
a better world. On the third day we started on, hoping that we might one
day return to dig up our buried ivory, and in due course, after a long
and wearisome tramp, and many adventures which I have not space to detail,
reached Sitanda's Kraal, near the Lukanga River, the real starting-point
of our expedition. Very well do I recoiled our arrival at that place. To
the right was a scattered native settlement with a few stone cattle kraals
and some cultivated lands down by the water, where these savages grew their
scanty supply of grain, and beyond it great tracts of waving "veldt" covered
with tall grass, over which herds of the smaller game were wandering To
the left was the vast desert. This spot appeared to be the outpost of the
fertile country, and it would be difficult to say to what natural causes
such an abrupt change in the character of the soil was due. But so it was.
Just below our encampment flowed a little stream, on the farther side of
which was a stony slope, the same down which I had twenty years before
seen poor Silvestre creeping back after his attempt to reach Solomon's
Mines, and beyond that slope began the waterless desert covered with a
species of karoo shrub. It was evening when we pitched our camp, and the
great fiery ball of the sun was sinking into the desert, sending glorious
rays of many-colored light flying over all the vast expanse. Leaving Good
to superintend the arrangement of our little camp; I took Sir Henry with
me, and we walked to the top of the slope opposite and gazed out across
the desert. The air was very clear, and far, far away I could distinguish
the faint blue outlines, here and there capped with white, of the great
Suliman Berg.

<P>&nbsp;"There," I said, "there is the wall of Solomon's Mines, but God
knows if we shall ever climb it."

<P>&nbsp;"My brother should be there, and if he is I shall reach him somehow,"
said Sir Henry, in that tone of quiet confidence which marked the man.

<P>&nbsp;"I hope so," I answered, and turned to go back to the camp, when
I saw that we were not alone. Behind us, also gazing earnestly towards
the far-off mountains, was the great Zulu, Umbopa.

<P>&nbsp;The Zulu spoke when he saw that I had observed him, but addressed
himself to Sir Henry, to whom he had attached himself.

<P>&nbsp;"Is it to that land that thou wouldst journey, `Incubu?" (a native
word meaning, I believe, an elephant, and the name given to Sir Henry by
the Kaffirs) he said, pointing towards the mountains with his broad assegai.

<P>&nbsp;I asked him sharply what he meant by addressing his master in
that familiar way. It is very well for natives to have a name for one among
themselves, but it is not decent that they should call one by their heathenish
appellations to one's face. The man laughed a quiet little laugh which
angered me.

<P>&nbsp;"How dost thou know that I am not the equal of the Inkosi I serve?"
he said. "He is of a royal house, no doubt; one can see it in his size
and in his eye; so, mayhap, am I. At least I am as great a man. Be my mouth,
oh, Macumazahn, and say my words to the Inkoos Incubu, my master, for I
would speak to him and to thee."

<P>&nbsp;I was. angry with the man, for I am not accustomed to be talked
to in that way by Kaffirs but somehow he impressed me, and besides I was
curious to know what he had to say, so I translated, expressing my opinion
at the same time that he was an impudent fellow, and that his swagger was
outrageous.

<P>&nbsp;"Yes, Umbopa," answered Sir Henry, "I would journey there."

<P>&nbsp;"The desert is wide and there is no water; the mountains are high
and covered with snow, and man cannot say what is beyond them behind the
place where the sun sets; how shalt thou come thither, Incubu, and wherefore
dost thou go?"

<P>&nbsp;I translated again.

<P>&nbsp;"Tell him," answered Sir Henry, "that I go because I believe that
a man of my blood, my brother, has gone there before me, and I go to seek
him."

<P>&nbsp;"That is so, Incubu; a man I met on the road told me that a white
man went out into the desert two years ago towards those mountains with
one servant, a hunter. They never came back."

<P>&nbsp;"How do you know it was my brother?" asked Sir Henry.

<P>&nbsp;"Nay, I know not. But the man, when I asked what the white man
was like, said that he had your eyes and a black beard. He said, too, that
the name of the hunter with him was Jim, that he was a Bechuana hunter
and wore clothes."

<P>&nbsp;"There is no doubt about it," said I; "I knew Jim well."

<P>&nbsp;Sir Henry nodded. "I was sure of it," he said. "If George set
his mind upon a thing he generally did it. It was always so from his boyhood.
If he meant to cross the Suliman Berg he has crossed it, unless some accident
has overtaken him, and we must look for him on the other side."

<P>&nbsp;Umbopa understood English, though he rarely spoke it.

<P>&nbsp;"It is a far journey, Incubi," he put in, and I translated his
remark.

<P>&nbsp;"Yes," answered Sir Henry, "it is far. But there is no journey
upon this earth that a man may not make if he sets his heart to it. There
is nothing, Umbopa, that he cannot do, there are no mountains he may not
climb, there are no deserts he cannot cross, save a mountain and a desert
of which you are spared the knowledge, if love leads him, and he holds
his life in his hand counting it as nothing, ready to keep it or to lose
it as Providence may order." I translated.

<P>&nbsp;"Great words, my father," answered the Zulu (I always called him
a Zulu, though he was not really one), "great, swelling words, fit to fill
the mouth of a man. Thou art right, my father Incubu. Listen! what is life?
It is a feather; it is the seed of the grass, blown hither and thither,
sometimes multiplying itself and dying in the act, sometimes carried away
into the heavens. But if the seed be good and heavy it may perchance travel
a little way on the road it will. It is well to try and journey one's road
and to fight with the air. Man must die. At the worst he can but die a
little sooner. I will go with thee across the desert and over the mountains,
unless perchance I fall to the ground on the way, my father."

<P>&nbsp;He paused awhile, and then went on with one of those strange bursts
of rhetorical eloquence which Zulus sometimes indulge in, and which, to
my mind, full as they are of vain repetitions, show that the race is by
no means devoid of poetic instinct and of intellectual power.

<P>&nbsp;"What is life? Tell me, O white men, who are wise, who know the
secrets of the world, and the world of stars, and the world that lies above
and around the stars; who flash their words from afar without a voice;
tell me, white men, the secret of our life - whither it goes and whence
it comes!

<P>&nbsp;"Ye cannot answer; ye know not. Listen, I will answer. Out of
the dark we came, into the dark we go. Like a storm-driven bird at night
we fly out of the Nowhere; for a moment our wings are seen in the light
of the fire, and, lo! we are gone again into the Nowhere. Life is nothing.
Life is all. It is the hand with which we hold off death. It is the glow-worm
that shines in the night-time and is black in the morning; it is the white
breath of the oxen in winter; it is the little shadow that runs across
the grass and loses itself at sunset."

<P>&nbsp;"You are a strange man," said. Sir Henry, when he ceased.

<P>&nbsp;Umbopa laughed. "It seems to me that we are much alike, Incubu.
Perhaps I seek a brother over the mountains."

<P>&nbsp;I looked at him suspiciously. "What dost thou mean?" I asked;
"what dost thou know of the mountains?"

<P>&nbsp;"A little; a very little. There is a strange land there, a land
of witchcraft and beautiful things; a land of brave people and of trees
and streams and white mountains and of a great white road. I have heard
of it. But what is the good of talking? it grows dark. Those who live to
see will see."

<P>&nbsp;Again I looked at him doubtfully. The man knew too much.

<P>&nbsp;"Ye need not fear me, Macumazahn," he said, interpreting my look.
"I dig no holes for ye to fall in. I make no plots. If ever we cross those
mountains behind the sun, I will tell what I know. But death sits upon
them. Be wise, and turn back. Go and hunt elephant. I have spoken."

<P>&nbsp;And without another word he lifted his spear in salutation and
returned towards the camp, where shortly afterwards we found him cleaning
a gun like any other Kaffir.

<P>&nbsp;"That is an odd man," said Sir Henry.

<P>&nbsp;"Yes," answered I, "too odd by half. I don't like his little ways.
He knows something, and won't speak out. But I suppose. it is no use quarrelling
with him. We are in for a curious trip, and a mysterious Zulu won't make
much difference one way or another."

<P>&nbsp;Next day we made our arrangements for starting. Of course it was
impossible to drag our heavy elephant rifles and other kit with us across
the desert, so, dismissing our bearers, we made an arrangement with an
old native who had a kraal close by to take care of them till we returned.
It went to my heart to leave such things as those sweet tools to the tender
mercies of an old thief, of a savage whose greedy eyes I could see gloating
over them. But I took some precautions.

<P>&nbsp;First of all I loaded all the rifles, and informed him that if
he touched them they would go off. He instantly tried the experiment with
my eight-bore, and it did go off, and blew a hole right through one of
his oxen, which were just then being driven up to the kraal, to say nothing
of knocking him head over heels with the recoil. He got up considerably
startled, and not at all pleased at the loss of the ox, which he had the
impudence to ask me to pay for, and nothing would induce him to touch them
again.

<P>&nbsp;"Put the live devils up there in the thatch," he said, "out of
the way, or they will kill us all."

<P>&nbsp;Then I told him that if, when we came back, one of those things
was missing I would kill him and all his people by witchcraft; and if we
died and he tried to steal the things, I would come and haunt him and turn
his cattle mad and his milk sour till life was a weariness, and make the
devils in the guns come out and talk to him in a way he would not like,
and generally gave him a good idea of judgment to come. After that he swore
he would look after them as though they were his father's spirit. He was
a very superstitious old Kaffir and a great villain.

<P>&nbsp;Having thus disposed of our superfluous gear we arranged the kit
we five - Sir Henry, Good, myself, Umbopa, and the Hottentot Ventv&ouml;gel
- were to take with us on our journey. It was small enough, but do what
we would we could not get it down under about forty pounds a man. This
is what it consisted of:

<P>&nbsp;The three express rifles and two hundred rounds of ammunition.

<P>&nbsp;The two Winchester repeating rifles (for Umbopa and Ventv&ouml;gel),
with two hundred rounds of cartridge.

<P>&nbsp;Three "Colt" revolvers and sixty rounds of cartridge.

<P>&nbsp;Five Cochrane's water-bottles, each holding four pints.

<P>&nbsp;Five blankets.

<P>&nbsp;Twenty-five pounds' weight of biltong (sun-dried game flesh).

<P>&nbsp;Ten pounds' weight of best mixed beads for gifts.

<P>&nbsp;A selection of medicine, including an ounce of quinine, and one
or two small surgical instruments.

<P>&nbsp;Our knives, a few sundries, such as a compass, matches, a pocket-filter,
tobacco, a trowel, a bottle of brandy, and the clothes we stood in.

<P>&nbsp;This was our total equipment, a small one, indeed, for such a
venture, but we dared not attempt to carry more. As it was, that load was
a heavy one per man to travel across the burning desert with, for in such
places every additional ounce tells upon one. But try as we would we could
not see our way to reducing-it. There was nothing but what was absolutely
necessary.

<P>&nbsp;With great difficulty, and by the promise of a present of a good
hunting knife each, I succeeded in persuading three wretched natives from
the village to come with us for the first stage, twenty miles, and to carry
each a large gourd holding a gallon of water. My object was to enable us
to refill our water-bottles after the first night's march, for we determined
to start in the cool of the night. I gave out to these natives that we
were going to shoot ostriches, with which the desert abounded. They jabbered
and shrugged their shoulders, and said we were mad and should perish of
thirst, which I must say seemed very probable; but being desirous of obtaining
the knives, which were almost unknown treasures up there, they consented
to come, having probably reflected that, after all, our subsequent extinction
would be no affair of theirs.

<P>&nbsp;All next day we rested and slept, and at sunset ate a hearty meal
of fresh beef washed down with tea, the last, as Good sadly remarked, we
were likely to drink for many a long day. Then, having made our final preparations,
we lay down and waited for the moon to rise. At last, about nine o'clock,
up she came in all her chastened glory, flooding the wild country with
silver light, and, throwing a weird sheen on the vast expanse of rolling
desert before us, which looked as solemn and quiet and as alien to man
as the star-studded firmament above. We rose up, and in a few minutes were
ready, and yet we hesitated a little, as human nature is prone to hesitate
on the threshold of an irrevocable step. We three white men stood there
by ourselves. Umbopa, assegai in hand and the rifle across his shoulders,
a few paces ahead of us, looked out fixedly across the desert, the three
hired natives, with the gourds of water, and Ventv&ouml;gel were gathered
in a little knot behind.

<P>&nbsp;"Gentlemen." said Sir Henry, presently, in his low, deep voice,
"we are going on. about as strange a journey as men can make in this world.
It is very doubtful if we can succeed in it. But we are three men who will
stand together for good or for evil to the last. And now before we start
let us for a moment pray to the Power Who shapes the destinies of men,
and who ages since has marked out our paths, that it may please him to
direct our steps in accordance with his will."

<P>&nbsp;Taking off his hat he, for the space of a minute or so, covered
his face with his hands, and Good and I did likewise.

<P>&nbsp;I do not say that I am a first-rate praying-man; few hunters are;
and as for Sir Henry, I never heard him speak like that before, and only
once since, though deep down in his heart I believe he is very religious.
Good, too, is pious, though very apt to swear. Anyhow I do not think I
ever, excepting on one single occasion, put in a better prayer in my life
than I did during that minute, and somehow I felt the happier for it. Our
future was so completely unknown, and I think the unknown and the awful
always bring a man nearer to his Maker.

<P>&nbsp;"And now," said Sir Hay, "trek."

<P>&nbsp;So we started.

<P>&nbsp;We had nothing to guide ourselves by except the distant mountains
and old Jos&eacute; da Silvestra's chart, which, considering that it was
drawn by a dying and half distraught man on a fragment of linen three centuries
ago, was not a very satisfactory sort of thing to work on. Still, such
as it was, our little hope of success depended on it. If we failed in finding
that pool of bad water which the old don marked as being situated in the
middle of the desert, about sixty miles from our starting-point and as
far from the mountains, we must in all probability perish miserably of
thirst. And to my mind the chances of our finding it in that great sea
of sand and karoo scrub seemed almost infinitesimal. Even supposing Da
Silvestra had marked it right, what was there to prevent its having been
generations ago dried up by the sun, or trampled in by game, or filled
with drifting sand?

<P>&nbsp;On we tramped silently as shades through the night and in the
heavy sand. The karoo bushes caught our shins and retarded us, and the
sand got into our veldtschoons and Good's shooting-boots, so that every
few miles we had to stop and empty them; but still the night was fairly
cool, though the atmosphere was thick and heavy, giving a sort of creamy
feel to the air, and we made fair progress. It was very still and lonely
there in the desert, oppressively so indeed. Good felt this, and once began
to whistle the "Girl I left behind me," but the notes sounded lugubrious
in that vast place, and he gave it up. Shortly afterwards a little incident
occurred which, though it made us jump at the time, gave rise to a laugh.
Good, as the holder of the compass, which, being a sailor, of course he
thoroughly understood, was leading, and we were toiling along in single
file behind him, when suddenly we heard the sound of an exclamation, and
he vanished. Next second there arose all round us a most extraordinary
hubbub, snorts, groans, wild sounds of rushing feet. In the faint light,-too;
we could descry dim, galloping forms half hidden by wreaths of sand. The
natives threw down their loads and prepared to bolt, but, remembering that
there was nowhere to bolt to, cast themselves upon the ground and howled
out that it was the devil. As for Sir Henry and myself, we stood amazed;
nor was our amazement lessened when we perceived the form of Good careering
off in the direction of the mountains, apparently mounted on the back of
a horse and halloing like mad. In another second he threw up his arms,
and we heard him come to the earth with a thud. Then I saw what had happened:
we had stumbled right on to a herd of sleeping quagga, on to the back of
one of which Good had actually fallen, and the brute had naturally enough
got up and made off with him. Singing out to the others that it was all
right, I ran towards Good, much afraid lest he should be hurt, but to my
great relief found him sitting in the sand, his eye-glass still fixed firmly
in his eye, rather shaken and very much startled, but not in any way injured.

<P>&nbsp;After this we travelled on without any further misadventure till
after one o'clock, when we called a halt, and having drunk a little water,
not much, for water was precious, and rested for half an hour, started
on again.

<P>&nbsp;On, on we went till at last the east began to blush like the cheek
of a girl. Then there came faint rays of primrose light that changed presently
to golden bars, through which the dawn glided out across the desert. The
stars grew pale and paler still till at last they vanished; the golden
moon waxed wan, and her mountain ridges stood out clear against her sickly
face like the bones on the face of a dying man; then came spear upon spear
of glorious light flashing far away across the boundless wilderness, piercing
and firing the veils of mist till the desert was draped in a tremulous
golden glow, and it was day.

<P>&nbsp;Still we did not halt, though by this time we should have been
glad. enough to do so, for We knew that when once the sun was fully up
it would be almost impossible for us to travel in it. At length, about
six o'clock, we spied a little pile of rocks rising out of the plain, and
to this we dragged ourselves. As luck would have it, here we found an overhanging
slab of rock carpeted beneath with smooth sand, which afforded a most grateful
shelter from the heat. Underneath this we crept, and having drank some
water each and eaten a bit of biltong, we lay down and were soon sound
asleep.

<P>&nbsp;It was three o'clock in the afternoon before we woke, to find
our three bearers preparing to return. They had already had enough of the
desert, and no number of knives would have tempted them to come a step
farther. So we had a hearty drink, and, having emptied our water-bottles,
filled them up again from the gourds they had brought with them, and then
watched them depart on their twenty miles' tramp home.

<P>&nbsp;At half-past four we also started on. It was lonely and desolate
work, for, with the exception of a few ostriches, there was not a single
living creature to be seen on all the vast expanse of sandy plain. It was
evidently too dry for game, and, with the exception of a deadly looking
cobra or two, we saw no reptiles. One insect, however, was abundant, and
that was the common or house fly. There they came, "not as single spies,
but in battalions," as I think the Old Testament says somewhere. He is
an extraordinary animal, is the house fly. Go where you will you find him,
and so it must always have been. I have seen him enclosed in amber which
must, I was told, have been half a million years old, looking exactly like
his descendant of today, and I have little doubt that when the last man
lies dying on the earth he will be buzzing round - if that event should
happen to occur in summer - watching for an opportunity to settle on his
nose.

<P>&nbsp;At sunset we halted, waiting for the moon to rise. At ten she
came up beautiful and serene as ever, and, with one halt about two o'clock
in the morning, we trudged wearily on through the night, till at last the
welcome sun put a period to our labors. We drank a little and flung ourselves
down, thoroughly tired out, on the sand, and were soon all asleep. There
was no need to set a watch, for we had nothing to fear from anybody or
anything in that vast, untenanted plain. Our only enemies were heat, thirst,
and flies, but far rather would I have faced any danger from man or beast
than that awful trinity. This time we were not so lucky as to find a sheltering
rock to guard us from the glare of the sun, with the result that about
seven o'clock we woke up experiencing the exact sensations one would attribute
to a beefsteak on a gridiron. We were literally being baked through and
through. The burning sun seemed to be sucking our very blood out of us.
We sat up. and gasped.

<P>&nbsp;"Phew!" said I, grabbing at the halo of flies which buzzed cheerfully
round my head. The heat did not affect them.

<P>&nbsp;"My word," said Sir Henry.

<P>&nbsp;"It <I>is</I> hot!" said Good.

<P>&nbsp;It was hot, indeed, and there was not a bit of shelter to be had.
Look where we would there was no rock or tree; nothing but an unending
glare, rendered dazzling by the hot air which danced over the surface of
the desert as it does over a red-hot stove.

<P>&nbsp;"What is to be done?" asked Sir Henry; "we can't stand this for
long." We looked at each other blankly.

<P>&nbsp;"I have it," said Good; "we must dig a hole and get into it, and
cover ourselves with the karoo bushes."

<P>&nbsp;It did not seem a very promising suggestion, but at least it was
better than nothing, so we set to work, and, with the trowel we had brought
with us and our hands, succeeded in about an hour in delving out a patch
of ground about ten feet long by twelve wide to the depth of two feet.
Then we cut a quantity of low scrub with our hunting knives, and, creeping
into the hole, pulled it over us all, with the exception of Ventv&ouml;gel,
on whom, being a Hottentot, the sun had no particular effect. This gave
us some slight shelter from the burning rays of the sun, but the heat in
that amateur grave can be better imagined than described. The Black Hole
of Calcutta must have been a fool to it; indeed, to this moment; I do not
know how we lived through the day. There we lay panting, and every now
and again moistening our lips from our scanty supply of water. Had we followed
our inclinations we should have finished off all we had in the first two
hours, but we had to exercise the most rigid care, for if our water failed
us we knew that we must quickly perish miserably.

<P>&nbsp;But everything has an end, if only you live long enough to see
it, and somehow that miserable day wore on towards evening. About three
o'clock in the afternoon we determined that we could stand it no longer.
It would be better to die walking than to be slowly killed by heat and
thirst in that dreadful hole. So, taking each of. us a little drink from
our fast diminishing supply of water now heated to about the same temperature
as a man's blood, we staggered on.

<P>&nbsp;We had now covered some fifty miles of desert. If my reader will
refer to the rough copy and translation of old Da Silvestra's map he will
see that the desert is marked as being forty leagues across, and the "pan
bad water" is set down as being about in the middle of it. Now, forty leagues
is one hundred and twenty miles; consequently, we ought at the most to
be. within twelve or fifteen miles of the water, if any should really exist.

<P>&nbsp;Through the. afternoon we crept slowly and painfully along, scarcely
doing more than a mile and a half an hour. At sunset we again rested, waiting
for the moon, and, after drinking a little, managed to get some sleep.

<P>&nbsp;Before we lay down Umbopa pointed out to us a slight and indistinct
hillock on the flat surface of the desert about eight miles away. At the
distance it looked like an ant-hill, and as I was dropping off to sleep
I fell to wondering what it could be.

<P>&nbsp;With the moon we started on again, feeling dreadfully exhausted,
and suffering tortures from thirst and prickly heat. Nobody who has not
felt it can know what we went through. We no longer walked, we staggered,
now and again falling from exhaustion, and being obliged to call a halt
every hour or so. We had scarcely energy left in us to speak. Up to now
Good had chatted and joked, for he was a merry fellow; but now he had not
a joke left in him.

<P>&nbsp;At last, about two o'clock, utterly worn out in body and mind,
we came to the foot of this queer hill, or sand koppie, which did at first
sight resemble a gigantic ant-heap about a hundred feet high, and covering
at the base nearly a morgen (two acres) of ground.

<P>&nbsp;Here we halted, and, driven by our desperate thirst, sucked down
our last drops of water. We had but half a pint a head, and we could each
have drank a gallon.

<P>&nbsp;Then we lay down. Just as I was dropping off to sleep I heard
Umbopa remark to himself in Zulu,

<P>&nbsp;"If we cannot find water we shall all be dead before the moon
rises morrow."

<P>&nbsp;I shuddered, hot as it was. The near prospect of such an awful
death is not pleasant, but even the thought of it could not keep me from
sleeping.
