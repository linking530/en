<H3>
SOLOMON'S TREASURE-CHAMBER</H3>
While we had been engaged in getting over our fright, and in examining
the grisly wonders of the place, Gagool had been differently occupied.
Somehow or other - for she was marvellously active when she chose - she
had scrambled on to the great table and made her way to where our departed
friend Twala was placed under the drip, to see, suggested Good, how he
was "pickling," or for some dark purpose of her own. Then she came hobbling
back, stopping now and again. to address a remark (the tenor of which I
could not catch) to one or other of the shrouded forms, just as you or
I might greet an old acquaintance. Having gone through this mysterious
and horrible ceremony, she squatted herself down on the table immediately
under the white Death, and began, so far as I could make. out, to offer
up prayers to it. The spectacle of this wicked old creature pouring out
supplications (evil ones, no doubt) to the arch-enemy of mankind was so
uncanny that it caused us to hasten our inspection.

<P>&nbsp;"Now, Gagool," said I, in a low voice - somehow one did not dare
to speak above a whisper in that place - "lead us to the chamber."

<P>&nbsp;The old creature promptly scrambled down off the table.

<P>&nbsp;"My lords are not afraid?" she said, leering up into my face.

<P>&nbsp;"Lead on."

<P>&nbsp;"Good, my lords;" and she hobbled great Death.

<P>&nbsp;"Here is the chamber; let my lords light she placed the gourd
full of oil upon the floor, and leaned herself against the side of the
cave. I took out a match, of which we still had a few in a box, and lit
the rush wick and then looked for the doorway, but there was nothing before
us but the solid rock.

<P>&nbsp;Gagool grinned. "The way is there, my lords."

<P>&nbsp;"Do not jest with us," I said, sternly.

<P>&nbsp;"I jest not, my lords. See!" and she pointed at the rock.

<P>&nbsp;As she did so, on holding up the lamp we perceived that a mass
of stone was slowly rising from the floor and vanishing into the rock above,
where doubtless there was a cavity prepared to receive it. The mass was
of the width of a good-sized door, about ten feet' high and not less than
five feet thick. It must have weighed at least twenty or thirty tons, and
was clearly moved upon some simple balance principle, probably the same
as that upon which the opening and shutting of an ordinary modern window
is arranged. How the principle was set in motion, of course none of us
saw; Gagool was careful to avoid that; but I have little doubt that there
was some very simple lever, which was moved ever so. little by pressure
on a secret spot, thereby throwing additional weight on to the hidden counterbalances,
and causing the whole huge mass to be lifted from the ground. Very slowly
and gently the great stone raised itself, till at last it had vanished
altogether, and a dark hole presented itself to us in the place which it
had filled.

<P>&nbsp;Our excitement was so intense, as we saw the way to Solomon's
treasure chamber at last thrown open, that I for one began to tremble and
shake. Would it prove a hoax after all, I wondered, or was old Da Silvestra
right? and were there vast hoards of wealth stored in that dark place,
hoards which would make us the richest men in the whole world? We should
know in a minute or two.

<P>&nbsp;"Enter, white men from the stars," said Gagool, advancing into
the doorway; "but first hear your servant, Gagaoola the old. The bright
stones that ye will see were dug out of the pit over which the Silent Ones
are set, and stored here, I know not by whom. But once has this place been
entered since the time that those who stored the stones departed in haste,
leaving them behind. The report of the treasure went down among the people
who lived in the country from age to age, but none knew where the chamber
was, nor the secret of the door. But it happened that a white man reached
this country from over the mountains, perchance he too came `from the stars,'
and was well received of the king of the day. He it is who sits yonder,
and she pointed to the fifth king at the table of the dead. And it came
to pass that he and a woman of the country who was with him came to this
place, and that by chance the woman learned the secret of the door - a
thousand years might ye search, but ye should never find it. Then the white
man entered with the woman and found the stones, and filled with stones
the skin of a small goat, which the woman had with her to hold food. And
as he was going from the chamber he took up one more stone, a large one,
and held it in his hand." Here she paused.

<P>&nbsp;"Well," I asked, breathless with interest, as we all were, "what
happened to Da Silvestra?"

<P>&nbsp;The old hag started at the mention of the name.

<P>&nbsp;"How knowest thou the dead man's name?" she asked, sharply; and
then, without waiting for an answer, went on -

<P>"None knew what happened; but it came about that the white man was frightened,
for he flung down the goatskin with the stones, and fled out with only
the one stone in his hand, and that the king took, and it is the stone
that thou, Macumazahn, didst take from Twala's brows."

<P>&nbsp;"Have none entered here since?" I asked, peering again down the
dark passage.

<P>&nbsp;"None, my lords. Only the secret of the door hath been kept, and
every king hath opened it, though he hath not entered. There is a saying,
that those who enter there will die within a moon, even as the white man
died in the cave upon the mountain, where ye found him, Macumazahn. Ha!
ha! mine are true words."

<P>&nbsp;Our eyes met as she said it, and I turned sick and cold. How did
the old hag know all these things?

<P>&nbsp;"Enter, my lords. If I speak truth the goat-skin with the stones
will lie upon the floor; and if there is truth as to whether it is death
to enter here, that will ye learn afterwards. Ha! ha! ha!" And she hobbled
through the doorway, bearing the light with her; but I confess that once
more I hesitated about following.

<P>&nbsp;"Oh, confound it all!" said Good, "here goes. I am not going to
be frightened by that old devil;" and, followed by Foulata, who, however,
evidently did not at all like the job, for she was shivering with fear,
he plunged into the passage after Gagool's example which we quickly followed.

<P>&nbsp;A few yards down the passage, in the narrow way hewn out of the
living rock, Gagool had paused, and was waiting. for us.

<P>&nbsp;"See, my lords," she said, holding the light before her, "those
who stored the treasure here fled in haste, and bethought them to guard
against any who should find the secret of the door, but had not the time,"
and she pointed to large square blocks of stone, which had, to the height
of two courses (about two feet three), been placed across the passage with
a view to walling it up. Along the side of the passage were similar blocks
ready for use, and, most curious of all, a heap of mortar and a couple
of trowels, which, so far as we had time to examine them, appeared to be
of a similar shape and make to those used by workmen of this day.

<P>&nbsp;Here Foulata, who had throughout been in a state of great fear
and agitation, said that she felt faint and could go no farther, but would
wait there. Accordingly we set her down on the unfinished wall, placing
the basket of provisions by her side, and left her to recover.

<P>&nbsp;Following the passage for about fifteen paces farther, we suddenly
came to an elaborately painted wooden door. It was standing wide open.
Whoever was last there had either not had the time, or had forgotten to
shut it.

<P>&nbsp;<I>Across the threshold lay a skin bag, formed of a goat-skin,
that appeared to be lull o! pebbles.</I> "Hee! hee! white men," sniggered
Gagool, as the light from the lamp fell upon it. "What did I tell ye, that
the white man who came here fled in haste, and dropped the woman's bag
- behold it!"

<P>&nbsp;Good stooped down and lifted it. It was heavy and jingled.

<P>&nbsp;"By Jove! I believe it's full of diamonds," he said, in an awed
whisper; and, indeed, the idea of a small goatskin full of diamonds is
enough to awe anybody.

<P>&nbsp;"Go on," said Sir Henry, impatiently. "Here, old lady, give me
the lamp," and, taking it from Gagool's hand, he stepped through the doorway
and held it high above his head. "

<P>&nbsp;We pressed in after him, forgetful, for the moment, of the bag
of diamonds, and found ourselves in Solomon's treasure-chamber.

<P>&nbsp;At first, all that the somewhat faint light given by the lamp
revealed was a room hewn out of the living rock, and apparently not more
than ten feet square. Next there came into sight, stored one on the other
as high as the roof, a splendid collection of elephant tusk. How many of
them there were we did not know, for of course we could not see how far
they went back, but there could not have been less than the ends of four
or five hundred tusks of the first quality visible to our eyes. There,
alone, was enough ivory before us to make a man wealthy for life. Perhaps,
I thought, it was from this very store that Solomon drew his material for
his "great throne of ivory," of which there was not the like made in any
kingdom.

<P>&nbsp;On the opposite side of the chamber were about a score of wooden
boxes, something like Martini-Henry ammunition boxes, only rather larger,
and painted red.

<P>&nbsp;"There are the diamonds" cried I; "bring the light."

<P>&nbsp;Sir Henry did so, holding it. close to the top box, of which the
lid, rendered rotten by time even in that dry place, appeared to have been
smashed in, probably by Da Silvestra himself. Pushing my hand through the
hole in the lid I drew it out full, not of diamonds, but of gold pieces,
of a shape that none of us had seen before, and with what looked like Hebrew
characters stamped upon them.

<P>&nbsp;"Ah!" I said, replacing the coin, "we sha'n't go back empty-handed,
anyhow. There must be a couple of thousand pieces in each box, and there
are eighteen boxes. I suppose it was the money to pay the workmen and merchants."

<P>&nbsp;"Well," put in Good, "I think that is the lot; I don't see any
diamonds, unless the old Portuguese put them all into this bag."

<P>&nbsp;"Let my lords look yonder where it is darkest, if they would find
the stones," said Gagool, interpreting our looks. "There my lords will
find a nook, and three stone chests in the nook two sealed and one open."

<P>&nbsp;Before interpreting this to Sir Henry, who had the light, I could
not resist asking how she knew these things, if no one had entered the
plaice since the white man, generations ago.

<P>&nbsp;"Ah, Macumazahn, who watchest by night," was the mocking answer,
"ye who live in the stars, do ye not know that some have eyes that can
see through rock?"

<P>&nbsp;"Look in that corner, Curtis," I said, indicating the spot. Gagool
had pointed out.

<P>&nbsp;"Hallo, you fellows," he said, "here's a recess. Great heavens!
look here."

<P>&nbsp;We hurried up to where he was standing in a nook, something like
a small bow-window. Against the wall of this recess were placed three stone
chests, each about two feet square. Two were fitted with stone lids, the
lid of the third rested against: the side of the chest, which was open.

<P>&nbsp;"<I>Look!</I>" he repeated, hoarsely, holding the lamp over the
open chest. We looked, and for a moment could make nothing out, on account
of a silvery sheen that dazzled us. When our eyes got used to it we saw
that the chest was three-parts full of uncut diamonds, most of them of
considerable size. Stooping, I picked some up. Yes, there was no mistake
about. it, there was the unmistakable soapy feel about them.

<P>&nbsp;I fairly gasped as I dropped them.

<P>&nbsp;"We are the richest men in the whole world," I said. "Monte Cristo
is a fool to us."

<P>&nbsp;"We shall flood the market with diamonds," said Good.

<P>&nbsp;"Got to get them there first?" suggested Sir Henry.

<P>&nbsp;And we stood with pale faces and stared at each other, with the
lantern in the middle, and the glimmering gems below, as though we were
conspirators about to commit a crime, instead of being, as we thought,
the three most fortunate men on earth.

<P>&nbsp;"Hee! hee! hee!" went old Gagool behind us, as she flitted about
like a vampire bat. "There are the bright stones that ye love, white men,
as many as ye will; take them, run them through your fingers, <I>eat</I>
of them, hee! hee! <I>drink</I> of them, ha! ha!"

<P>&nbsp;There was something so ridiculous at that moment to my mind in
the idea of eating and drinking diamonds that I began to laugh outrageously,
an example which the others, followed, without knowing why. There we stood
and shrieked with laughter over the gems which were ours, which had been
found for us thousands of years ago by the patient delvers in the great
hole yonder, and stored for us by Solomon's long-dead overseer, whose name,
perchance, was written in the characters stamped on the faded wax that
yet adhered to the lids of the chest. Solomon never got them, nor David,
nor Da Silvestra, nor anybody else. <I>We</I> had got them; there before
us were millions of pounds' worth of diamonds, and thousands of pounds'
worth of gold and ivory, only waiting to be taken away.

<P>&nbsp;Suddenly the fit passed off, and we stopped laughing. "Open the
other chests, white men," croaked Gagool, "there are surely more therein.
Take your fill, white lords!"

<P>&nbsp;Thus adjured, we set to work to pull up the stone lids on the
other two, first - not without a feeling of sacrilege-breaking the seals
that fastened them.

<P>&nbsp;Hoorah! they were full too, full to the brim; at least the second
one was; no wretched Da Silvestra had been filling goat-skins out of that.
As for the third chest, it was only about a fourth full, but the stones
were all picked ones; none less than twenty carats, and some of them as
large as pigeon-eggs. Some of these biggest ones, however, we could see
by holding them up to the light, were a little yellow, "off colored," as
they call it at Kimberley.

<P>&nbsp;What we did not see, however, was the look of fearful malevolence
that old Gagool favored us with as she crept, crept like a snake, out of
the treasure chamber and down the passage towards the massive door of solid
rock.

<P>&nbsp;
<CENTER>* * * * *</CENTER>
Hark! Cry upon cry comes ringing up the vaulted path. It is Foulata's voice!

<P>&nbsp;<I>"Oh, Bougwan! Help! help! the rock falls!"</I>

<P>&nbsp;"Leave go, girl! Then - "

<P>&nbsp;<I>"Help! Help! she has stabbed me!</I>

<P>&nbsp;By now we are running down the passage, and this is what the light
from the lamp falls on. The door of rock is slowly closing down; it is
not three feet from the floor. Near it struggle. Foulata and Gagool. The
red blood of the former runs to her knees but still the brave girl holds
the old witch, who fights like a wildcat. Ah! she is free! Foulata fails,
and Gagool throws herself on the ground, to twist. herself like a snake
through the crack of the closing stone, She is under - ah, God! too late!
too late! The stone nips her, and she yells in agony. Down, down, it comes,
all the thirty tons of it, slowly pressing her old body against the rock
below. Shriek upon shriek, such as we never heard, then a long, sickening
<I>crunch</I>, and the door was shut just as we, rushing down the passage,
hurled ourselves against it. It was all done in four seconds.

<P>&nbsp;Then we turned to Foulata. The poor girl was stabbed in the body,
and could not, I saw, live long.

<P>&nbsp;"Ah! Bougwan, I die!" gasped the beautiful creature. "She crept
out - Gagool; I did not see her, I was faint - and the door began to fall;
then she came back, and was looking up the path - and I saw her come in
through the slowly falling door, and caught her and held her, and she stabbed
me, and I die, Bougwan.

<P>&nbsp;"Poor girl! poor girl!" Good cried; and then, as he could do nothing
else, he fell to kissing her.

<P>&nbsp;"Bougwan," she said, after a pause, "is Macumazahn there? it grows
so dark, I cannot see."

<P>&nbsp;"Here I am, Foulata."

<P>&nbsp;"Macumazahn, be my tongue for a moment, I pray thee, for Bougwan
cannot understand me, and before I go into the darkness - I would speak
a word."

<P>&nbsp;"Say on, Foulata, I will render it."

<P>&nbsp;"Say to my lord, Bougwan, that - I love him, and that I am glad
to die because I know that he cannot cumber his life with such as me, for
the sun cannot mate with the darkness, nor the white with the black.

<P>&nbsp;"Say that at times I have felt as though there were a bird in
my bosom, which would one day fly hence and sing elsewhere; even now, though
I cannot lift my hand, and my brain grows cold, I do not feel as though
my heart were dying; it is so full of love that could live a thousand years,
and yet be young. Say that if I live again, mayhap I shall see him in the
stars, and that - I will search them all, though perchance I should there
still be black and he would - still be white. Say - nay, Macumazahn, say
no more, save that I love-Oh, hold me closer, Bougwan, I cannot feel thine
arms - <I>oh! oh!</I>"

<P>&nbsp;"She is dead - -she is dead!" said Good, rising in grief, the
tears running down his honest face.

<P>&nbsp;"You need not let that trouble you, old fellow," said Sir Henry.

<P>&nbsp;"Eh!" said Good; "what do you mean?"

<P>&nbsp;"I mean that you will soon be in a position to join her. <I>Man,
don't you see that we are buried alive?</I>"

<P>&nbsp;Until Sir Henry uttered these words, I do not think the full horror
of what had happened had come home to us, preoccupied as we were with the
sight of poor Foulata's end. But now we understood. The ponderous mass
of rock had closed, probably forever, for the only brain which knew its
secret was crushed to powder beneath it. This was a door that none could
hope to force with anything short of dynamite in large quantities. And
we were the wrong side of it!

<P>&nbsp;For a few minutes we stood horrified there over the corpse of
Foulata. All the manhood seemed to have gone out of us. The first shock
of this idea of the slow and miserable end that awaited us was overpowering.
We saw it all now; that fiend, Gagool, had planned this snare for us from
the first. It would have been just the jest that her evil mind would have
rejoiced in, the idea; of the three white men, whom, for some. reason of
her own, she had always hated, slowly perishing of thirst am hunger in
the company of the treasure, they had coveted. I saw the point of that
sneer of hers about eating and drinking the diamonds now. Perhaps somebody
had tried to serve the poor old don in the same way, when he abandoned
the skin full of jewels.

<P>&nbsp;"This will never do," said Sir Henry hoarsely; "the lamp will
soon go out Let us see if we can't find the spring that works the rock."

<P>&nbsp;We sprang forward with desperate energy, and, standing in a bloody
ooze began to feel up and down the door and the sides of the passage. But
no knob or spring could we discover.

<P>&nbsp;"Depend on it," I said, "it does not work from the inside; if
it did Gagool would not have risked trying to crawl underneath the stone.
It was the knowledge of this that made her try to escape at all hazard,
curse her."

<P>&nbsp;"At all events," said Sir Henry, with a hard little laugh, "retribution
was swift; hers was almost as awful an end as ours is likely to be. We
can do nothing with the door; let us go back to the treasure-room." We
turned and went, and as we did so I perceived by the unfinished wall across
the passage the basket of food which poor Foulata had carried. I took it
up and brought it with me back to that accursed treasure-chamber that was
to be our grave. Then we went back and reverently bore in Foulata's corpse,
laying it on the floor by the boxes of coin.

<P>&nbsp;Next we seated ourselves, leaning our backs against the three
stone chests of priceless treasures.

<P>&nbsp;

<P>"Let us divide the food," said Sir Henry, "so as to make it last as
long as possible." Accordingly we did so. I would, we reckoned, make four
infinitesimally small meals for each of us enough, say, to support life
for a couple of days. Besides the biltong, or dried game-flesh, there were
two gourds of water, each holding about a quart.

<P>&nbsp;"Now," said Sir Henry, "let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we
die."

<P>&nbsp;We each ate a small portion of the biltong, and drank a sip of
water. We had, needless to say, but little appetite: though we were sadly
in need of food: and felt better after swallowing it. Then we got up and
made a systematic examination of the walls of our prison-house, in the
faint hope of finding some. means of exit, sounding them and the roof carefully.

<P>&nbsp;There was none. It was not probable that there would be one to
a treasure chamber.

<P>&nbsp;The lamp began to burn dim. The fat was nearly exhausted.

<P>&nbsp;"Quatermain," said Sir Henry, "what is the time - your watch goes?"

<P>&nbsp;I drew it out and looked at it. It was six o'clock; we had entered
the cave at eleven.

<P>&nbsp;"Infadoos will miss us," I suggested. "If we do not return to-night
he will search for us in the morning, Curtis."

<P>&nbsp;"He may search in vain. He does not know the secret of the door,
nor even where it is. No living person knew it yesterday, except Gagool.
To-day no one knows it. Even if he found the door he could not break it
down. All the Kukuana army could not break through five feet of living
rock. My friends, I see nothing for it but to bow ourselves to the will
of the Almighty. The search for treasure has brought many to a bad end;
we shall go to swell their number."

<P>&nbsp;The lamp grew dimmer yet.

<P>&nbsp;Presently it flared up and showed the whole scene, in strong relief,
the great mass of white tusk, the boxes furl of gold, the corpse of poor
Foulata stretched before them, the goat-skin full of treasure, the dim
glimmer of the diamonds, and the wild, wan faces of us three white men
seated there awaiting death by starvation.

<P>&nbsp;Suddenly it sank, and expired.
