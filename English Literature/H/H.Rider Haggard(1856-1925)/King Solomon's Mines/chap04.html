CHAPTER IV</H2>

<H3>
AN ELEPHANT HUNT</H3>
Now I do not propose to narrate at full length all the incidents of our
long journey up to Sitanda's Kraal, near the junction of the Lukanga and
Kalukwe rivers, a journey of more than a thousand miles from Durban, the
last three hundred or so of which, owing to the frequent presence of the
dreadful "tsetse" fly, whose bite is fatal to all animals except donkeys
and men, we had to make on foot.

<P>&nbsp;We left Durban at the end of January, and it was in the second
week of May that we camped near Sitanda's Kraal. Our adventures on the
way were many and various, but as they were of the sort which befall every
African hunter, I shall not - with one exception to be presently detailed
- -set them down here, lest I should render this history too wearisome.

<P>&nbsp;At Inyati, the outlying trading station in the Matabele country;
of which Lobengula (a great scoundrel) is king, we with many regrets parted
from our comfortable wagon. Only twelve oxen remained to us out of the
beautiful span of twenty which I had bought at Durban. One we had lost
from the bite of a cobra, three had perished from poverty and the want
of water, one had been lost, and the other three had died from eating the
poisonous herb called "tulip." Five more sickened from this cause, but
we managed to cure them with doses of an infusion made by boiling down
the tulip-leaves. If administered in time this is a very effective antidote.
The wagon and oxen we left in the immediate charge of Goza and Tom, the
driver and leader, both of them trustworthy boys, requesting a worthy Scotch
missionary who lived in this wild place to keep an eye to it. Then, accompanied
by Umbopa, Khiva, Ventv&ouml;gel, and half a dozen bearers whom we hired
on the spot, we started off on foot upon our wild quest. I remember we
were all a little silent on the occasion of that departure, and I think
that each of us was wondering if we should ever see that wagon again; for
my part I never expected to. For a while we tramped on in silence, till
Umbopa, who was marching in front, broke into a Zulu chant about how some
brave men, tired of life and the tameness of things, started off into a
great wilderness to find new things or die, and how, lo, and behold! when
they had got far into the wilderness, they found it was not a wilderness
at all, but a beautiful place full of young wives and fat cattle, of game
to hunt and enemies to kill.

<P>&nbsp;Then we all laughed and took it for a good omen. He was a cheerful
savage, was Umbopa, in a dignified sort of way, when he had not got one
of his fits of brooding, and had a wonderful trick of keeping one's spirits
up. We all got very fond of him.

<P>&nbsp;And now for the one adventure I am going to treat myself to, for
I do heartily love a hunting yam.

<P>&nbsp;About a fortnight's march from Inyati we came across a peculiarly
beautiful bit of fairly-watered wooded country: The kloofs in the hills
were covered with dense bush, "idoro" bush as the natives call it, and
in some places with the "wacht-een-beche" (wait-a-little) thorn, and there
were great quantities of the beautiful "machabell" tree, laden with refreshing
yellow fruit with enormous stones. This tree is the elephant's favorite
food, and there were not wanting signs that the great brutes were about,
for not only was their spoor frequent, but in many places the trees were
broken down and even uprooted. The elephant is a destructive feeder.

<P>&nbsp;One evening, after a long day's march, we came to a spot of peculiar
loveliness. At the foot of a bush-clad hill was a dry river-bed, in which,
however, were to be found pools of crystal water all trodden round with
the hoof-prints of game. Facing this hill was a park like plain, where
grew clumps of flat-topped mimosa, varied with occasional glossy leaved
machabells, and all round was the great sea of pathless, silent bush.

<P>&nbsp;As we emerged into this river-bed path we suddenly started a troop
of tall giraffes, who galloped, or, rather, sailed off, with their strange
gait, their tails screwed up over their backs, and their hoofs rattling
like castanets. They were about three hundred yards from us, and therefore
practically out of shot, but Good, who was walking ahead and had an express
loaded with solid ball in his hand, could not resist, but upped gun and
let drive at the last, a young cow. By some extraordinary chance the ball
struck it full on the back of the neck, shattering the spinal column, and
that giraffe went rolling head over heels just like a rabbit. I never saw
a more curious thing.

<P>&nbsp;"Curse it!" said Good - for I am sorry to say he had a habit of
using strong language when excited - contracted no doubt, in the course
of his nautical career; "curse it, I've killed him."

<P>&nbsp;"Ou, Bougwan," ejaculated the Kaffirs; "ou! ou!"

<P>&nbsp;They called Good "Bougwan" (glass eye) because of his eyeglass.

<P>&nbsp;"Oh! `Bougwan' !" re-echoed Sir Henry and I; and from that day
Good's reputation as a marvelous shot was established, at any rate among
the Kaffirs. Really he was a bad one, but whenever he missed we overlooked
it for the sake of that giraffe.

<P>&nbsp;Having set some of the "boys" to cut off the best of the giraffe
meat, we went to work to build a "scherm" near one of the pools about a
hundred yards to the right of it. This is done by cutting a quantity of
thorn bushes and laying them in the shape of a circular hedge. Then the
space enclosed is smoothed, and dry tambouki grass, if obtainable, is made
into a bed in the centre, and a fire or fires lighted.

<P>&nbsp;By the time the "scherm" was finished the moon was coming up,
and our dinner of giraffe steaks and roasted marrow-bones was ready. How
we enjoyed those marrow-bones, though it was rather a job to crack them!
I know no greater luxury than giraffe marrow, unless it is elephant's heart,
and we had that on the morrow. We ate our simple meal, pausing at times
to thank Good for his wonderful shot, by the light of the full moon, and
then we began to smoke and yarn, and a curious picture we must have made
squatted there round the fire. I, with my short grizzled hair sticking
up straight, and Sir Henry with his yellow locks, which were getting rather
long, were rather a contrast, especially as I am thin and short and dark,
weighing only nine stone and a half, and Sir Henry is tall and broad and
fair, and weighs fifteen. But perhaps the most curious-looking of the three,
taking all the circumstances of the case into consideration, was Captain
John Good, R.N. There he sat upon a leather bag, looking just as though
he had come in from a comfortable day's shooting in a civilized country,
absolutely clean, tidy, and well-dressed. He had on a shooting-suit of
brown tweed, with a hat to match, and neat gaiters. He was, as usual, beautifully
shaven, his eyeglass and his false teeth appeared to be in perfect order,
and altogether he was the nearest man I ever had to do with in the wilderness.
He even had on a collar, of which he had a supply, made of white gutta-percha.

<P>&nbsp;"You see, they weigh so little," he said to me, innocently, when
I expressed my astonishment at the fact; "I always liked to look like a
gentleman."

<P>&nbsp;Well, there we all sat yarning away in the beautiful moonlight,
and watching the Kaffirs a few yards off sucking their intoxicating "daccha"
in a pipe of which the mouthpiece was made of the horn of an eland, till
they one by one rolled themselves up in their blankets and went to sleep
by the fire, that is, all except Umbopa, who sat a little apart (I noticed
he never mixed much with the other hairs), his chin resting on his hand
apparently thinking deeply;

<P>&nbsp;Presently, from the depths of the bush behind us came a loud "woof!
woof!"

<P>&nbsp;"That's a lion," said I, and we all started up to listen. Hardly
had we done so, when from the pool, about a hundred yards off. came the
strident trumpeting of an elephant. "Unkungunklovo! Unkungunklovo!" (elephant!
elephant!) whispered the Kaffirs; and a few minutes afterwards we saw a
succession of vast shadowy forms moving slowly from the direction of the
water towards the bush. Up jumped Good, burning for slaughter, and thinking,
perhaps, that it was as easy to kill elephant as he had found it to shoot
giraffe, but I caught him by the arm and pulled him down.

<P>&nbsp;"It's no good," I said, "let them go."

<P>&nbsp;"It seems that we are in a paradise of game. I vote we stop here
a day or two, and have a go at them," said Sir Henry, presently.

<P>&nbsp;I was rather surprised, for hitherto Sir Henry had always been
for pushing on as fast as possible, more especially since we had ascertained
at Inyati that about two years ago an Englishman of the name of Neville
had sold his wagon there, and gone on up country; but I suppose his hunter
instincts had got the better of him.

<P>&nbsp;Good jumped at the idea, for he was longing to have a go at those
elephants; and so, to speak the truth, did I, for it went against my conscience
to let such a herd as that escape without having a pull at them.

<P>&nbsp;"All right, my hearties," said I. "I think we want a little recreation.
And now let's turn in, for we ought to be off by dawn, and then perhaps
we may catch them feeding before they move on."

<P>&nbsp;The others agreed, and we proceeded to make preparations. Good
took off his clothes, shook them, put his eyeglass and his false teeth
into his trousers pocket, and, folding them all up neatly, placed them
out of the dew under a comer of his mackintosh sheet. Sir Henry and I contented
ourselves with rougher arrangements, and were soon curled up in our blankets
and dropping off into the dreamless sleep that rewards the traveller.

<P>&nbsp;Going, going, go - What was that? Suddenly from the direction
of the water came a sound of violent scuffling, and next instant there
broke upon our ears a succession of the most awful roars. There was no
mistaking what they came from; only a lion could make such a noise as that.
We all jumped up and looked towards the water, in the direction of which
we saw a confused mass, yellow and black in color, staggering and struggling
towards us. We seized our rifles, and, slipping on our veldtschoons (shoes
made of untanned hide), ran out of the scherm towards it. By this time
it had fallen, and was rolling over and over on the ground, and by the
time we reached it it struggled no longer, but was quite still.

<P>&nbsp;And this was what it was. On the grass there lay a sable antelope
bull - the most beautiful of all the African antelopes - quite dead, and
transfixed by its great curved horns was a magnificent black-maned lion,
also dead. What had happened, evidently, was this. The sable antelope had
come down to drink at the pool, where the lion - no doubt the same we had
heard - had been lying in wait. While the antelope was drinking the lion
had sprung upon him, but was received upon the sharp, curved horns and
transfixed. I once saw the same thing happen before. The lion, unable to
free himself, had torn and beaten at the back and neck of the bull, which,
maddened with fear and pain, had rushed on till it dropped dead.

<P>&nbsp;As soon as we had sufficiently examined the dead beasts we called
the Kaffirs, and between us managed to drag their carcasses up to the scherm.
Then we went in and laid down, to wake no more till dawn.

<P>&nbsp;With the first light we were up and making ready for the fray.
We took with us the three eight-bore rifles, a good supply of ammunition,
and our large water-bottles filled with weak, cold tea, which I have always
found the best stuff to shoot on. After swallowing a little breakfast we
stared. Umbopa, Khiva, and Ventv&ouml;gel accompanying us. The other Kaffirs
we left with instructions to skin the lion and the sable antelope, and
cut up the latter.

<P>&nbsp;We had no difficulty in finding the broad elephant trail, which
Ventv&ouml;gel, after examination, pronounced to have been made by between
twenty and thirty elephants, most of them full-grown bulb. But the herd
had moved on some way during the night, and it was nine o'clock, and already
very hot, before, from the broken trees, bruised leaves and bark, and smoking
dung, we knew we could not be far off them.

<P>&nbsp;Presently we caught sight of the herd, numbering, as Ventv&ouml;gel
had said, between twenty and thirty, standing in a hollow, having finished
their morning meal, and flapping their great ears. It was a splendid sight.

<P>&nbsp;They were about two hundred yards from us. Taking a handful of
dry grass I threw it into the air to see how the wind was; for if once
they winded us I knew they would be off before we could get a shot. Finding
that, if anything, it blew from the elephants to us, we crept stealthily
on, and, thanks to the cover, managed to get within forty yards or so of
the great brutes. Just in front of us and broadside on stood three splendid
bulls, one of them with enormous tusks. I whispered to the others that
I would take the middle one; Sir Henry covered the one to the left, and
Good the bull with the big tusks.

<P>&nbsp;"Now," I whispered.

<P>&nbsp;Boom! boom! boom! went the three heavy rifles, and down went Sir
Henry's elephant, dead as a hammer, shot right through the heart. Mine
fell on to its knees, and I thought he was going to die, but in another
moment he was up and off, tearing along straight past me. As he went I
gave him the second barrel in his ribs, and this brought down in good earnest.
Hastily slipping in two fresh cartridges, I ran up close to him, and a
ball through the brain put an end to the poor brute's struggles. Then I
turned to see how Good had fared with the big bull, which I had heard screaming
with rage and pain as I gave mine its quietus. On reaching the captain
I found him in a great state of excitement. It appeared that on receiving
the bullet the bull had turned and come straight for his assailant, who
had barely time to get out of his way, and then charged blindly on past
him, in the direction of our encampment. Meanwhile the herd had crashed
off in wild alarm in the other direction.

<P>&nbsp;For a while we debated whether to go after the wounded bull or
follow the herd, and finally decided for the latter alternative, and departed
thinking that we had seen the last of those big tusks. I have often wished
since that we had. It was easy work to follow the elephants, for they had
left a. trail like a carriage-road behind them, crushing down the thick
bush in their furious flight as though it were tambouki grass. But to come
up with them was another matter, and we had struggled on under a broiling
sun for over two hours before we found them. They were, with the exception
of one bull, standing together, and I could see, from their unquiet way
and the manner in which they kept lifting their trunks to test the air,
that they were on the lookout for mischief. The solitary bull stood fifty
yards or so this side of the herd, over which he was evidently keeping
sentry, and about sixty yards from us. Thinking that he would see or wind
us, and that it would probably start them all off again if we tried to
get nearer, especially as the ground was rather open, we all aimed at this
bull and, at my whispered word, fired. All three shots took effect, and
down he went, dead. Again the herd started on, but, unfortunately for them,
about a hundred yards farther on was a nullah, or dried water-track, with
steep banks, a place very much resembling the one the Prince Imperial was
killed in in Zululand. Into this the elephants plunged, and when we reached
the edge we found them struggling in wild confusion to get up the other
bank, and filling the air with their screams, and trumpeting as they pushed
one another aside in their selfish panic, just like so many human beings.
Now was our opportunity, and, firing away as quick as we could load, we
killed five of the poor beasts, and no doubt should have bagged the whole
herd had they not suddenly given up their attempts to climb the bank and
rushed headlong down the nullah. We were too tired to follow them, and
perhaps also a little sick of slaughter, eight elephants being a pretty
good bag for one day.

<P>&nbsp;So, after we had rested a little and the Kaffirs had cut out the
hearts of two of the dead elephants for supper, we started homeward, very
well pleased with ourselves, having made up our minds to send the bearers
on the morrow to chop out the tusks.

<P>&nbsp;Shortly after we had passed the spot where Good had wounded the
patriarchal bull we came across a herd of eland, but did not shoot at them,
as we had already plenty of meat. They trotted past us, and then stopped
behind a little patch of bush about a hundred yards away and wheeled round
to look at us. As Good was anxious to get a near view of them, never having
seen an eland close, he handed his rifle to Umbopa, and, followed by Khiva,
strolled up to the patch of bush. We sat down and waited for him, not sorry
of the excuse for a little rest.

<P>&nbsp;The sun was just going down in its reddest glory, and Sir Henry
and I were admiring the lovely scene, when suddenly we heard an elephant
scream, and saw its huge and charging form with uplifted trunk and tail
silhouetted against the great red globe of the sun. Next second we saw
something else, and that was Good and Khiva tearing back towards us with
the wounded bull (for it was he) charging after them. For a moment we did
not dare to fire - though it would have been little use if we had at that
distance - for fear of hitting one of them, and the next a dreadful thing
happened: Good fell a victim to his passion for civilized dress. Had he
consented to discard his trousers and gaiters as we had, and hunt in a
flannel shirt and a pair of veldtschoons, it would have been all right,
but as it was his trousers cumbered him in that desperate race, and presently,
when he was about sixty yards from us, his boot, polished by the dry grass,
slipped, and down he went on his face right in front of the elephant.

<P>&nbsp;We gave a gasp, for we knew he must die, and ran as hard as we
could towards him. In three seconds it had ended, but not as we thought.
Khiva, the Zulu boy, had seen his master fall, and, brave lad that he was,
had turned and flung his assegai straight into the elephant's face. It
stuck in his trunk.

<P>&nbsp;With a scream of pain the brute seized the poor Zulu, hurled him
to the earth, and, placing his huge foot on to his body about the middle,
twined his trunk round his upper part and <I>tore him in two</I>.

<P>&nbsp;We rushed up, mad with horror, and fired again and again, and
presently the elephant fell upon the fragments of the Zulu.

<P>&nbsp;As for Good, he got up and wrung his hands over the brave man
who had given his life to save him; and myself, though an old hand, I felt
a lump in my throat. Umbopa stood and contemplated the huge dead elephant
and the mangled remains of poor Khiva.

<P>&nbsp;"Ah, well," he said, presently, "he is dead, but he died like
a man."
