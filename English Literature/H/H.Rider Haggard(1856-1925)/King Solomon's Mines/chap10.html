CHAPTER X</H2>

<H3>
THE WITCH-HUNT</H3>
ON reaching our hut, I motioned to Infadoos to enter with us.

<P>&nbsp;"Now, Infadoos," I said, "we would speak with thee."

<P>&nbsp;"Let my lords say on."

<P>&nbsp;"It seems to us, Infadoos, that Twala, the king, is a cruel man."

<P>&nbsp;"It is so, my lords. Alas! the land cries out with his cruelties.
To-night ye will see. It is the great witch-hunt, and many will be smelt
out as wizards and slain. No man's life is safe. If the king covets a man's
cattle or a man's life, or if he fears a man that he should excite a rebellion
against him, then Gagool, whom ye saw, or some of the witch-finding women
whom she has taught, will smell that man out as a wizard, and he will be
killed. Many will die before the moon grows pale tonight. It is ever so.
Perhaps I too shall be killed. As yet I have been spared, because I am
skilled in war and beloved by the soldiers; but I know not how long I shall
live. The land groans at the cruelties of Twala, the king; it is wearied
of him and his red ways."

<P>&nbsp;"Then why is it, Infadoos, that the people do not cast him down?"

<P>&nbsp;"Nay, my lords, he is the king, and if he were killed Scragga
would reign in his place, and the heart of Scragga is blacker than the
heart of Twala, his father. If Scragga were king the yoke upon our neck
would be heavier than the yoke of Twala. If Imotu had never been slain,
or if Ignosi, his son, had lived, it had been otherwise; but they are both
dead."

<P>&nbsp;"How know you that Ignosi is dead?" said a voice behind us. We
looked round with astonishment to see who spoke. It was Umbopa.

<P>&nbsp;"What meanest thou, boy?" asked Infadoos; "who told thee to speak?"

<P>&nbsp;"Listen, Infadoos," was the answer, "and I will tell thee a story.
Years ago the king Imotu was killed in this country, and his wife fled
with the boy Ignosi. Is it not so?"

<P>&nbsp;"It is so."

<P>&nbsp;"It was said that the woman and the boy died upon the mountains.
Is it not so?"

<P>&nbsp;"It is even so."

<P>&nbsp;"Well, it came to pass that the mother and the boy Ignosi did
not die. They crossed the mountains, and were led by a tribe of wandering
desert men across the sands beyond, till at last they came to water and
grass and trees again."

<P>&nbsp;"How knowest thou?"

<P>&nbsp;"Listen. They travelled on and on, many months' journey, till
they reached a land where a people called the Amazulu, who too are of the
Kukuana stock, live by war, and with them they tarried many years, till
at length the mother died. Then the son, Ignosi, again became a wanderer,
and went on into a land of wonders, where white people live, and for many
more years learned the wisdom of the white people,"

<P>&nbsp;"It is a pretty story," said Infadoos, incredulously.

<P>&nbsp;"For many years he lived there working as a servant and a soldier,
but holding in his heart all that his mother had told him of his own place,
and casting about in his mind to find how he might get back there to see
his own people and his father's house before he died. For many years he
lived and waited, and at last the time came, as it ever comes to him who
can wait for it, and he met some white men who would seek this unknown
land, and joined himself to them. The white men started and journeyed on
and on, seeking for one who is lost. They crossed the burning desert, they
crossed the snow-clad mountains, and reached the land of the Kukuanas,
and there they met thee, oh Infadoos."

<P>&nbsp;"Surely thou art mad to talk thus," said the astonished old soldier.

<P>&nbsp;"Thou thinkest so; see, I will show thee, O my uncle. <I>I am
Ignosi, rightful king of the Kukuanas</I>!"

<P>&nbsp;Then, with a single movement, he slipped off the "moocha," or
girdle round his middle, and stood naked before us.

<P>&nbsp;"Look," he said; "what is this?" and he pointed to the mark of
a great snake tattooed in blue round his middle, its tail disappearing
in its open mouth just above where the thighs are set into the body.

<P>&nbsp;Infadoos looked, his eyes starting nearly out of his head, and
then fell upon his knees.

<P>&nbsp;"<I>Koom! Koom!</I>" he ejaculated; "it is my brother's son; it
is the king."

<P>&nbsp;"Did I not tell thee so, my uncle? Rise; I am not yet the king,
but with thy help, and with the help of these brave white men, who are
my friends, I shall be. But the old woman Gagool was right; the land shall
run with blood first, and hers shall run with it, for she killed my father
with her words, and drove my mother forth. And now, Infadoos, choose thou.
Wilt thou put thy hands between my hands and be my man? Wilt thou share
the dangers that lie before me, and help me to overthrow this tyrant and
murderer, or wilt thou not? Choose thou?"

<P>&nbsp;The old man put his hand to his head and thought. Then he rose,
and, advancing to where Umbopa, or rather Ignosi stood, knelt before him
and took his hand.

<P>&nbsp;"Ignosi, rightful king of the Kukuanas, I put my hand between
thy hands, and am thy man till death. When thou wast a babe I dandled thee
upon my knee; now shall my old arm strike for thee and freedom."

<P>&nbsp;"It is well, Infadoos, if I conquer, thou shalt be the greatest
man in the kingdom after the king. If I fail, thou canst only die, and
death is not far off for thee. Rise, my uncle.

<P>&nbsp;"And ye, white men, will ye help me? What have I to offer ye!
The white stones, if I conquer and you can find them, ye shall have as
many as ye can carry hence. Will that suffice ye?" I translated this remark.

<P>&nbsp;"Tell him," answered Sir Henry, "that he mistakes an Englishman.
Wealth is good, and if it comes in our way we will take it; but a gentleman
does not sell himself for wealth. But, speaking for myself, I say this:
I have always liked Umbopa, and so far as in me we will stand by him in
this business. It will be very pleasant to me to try and square matters
with that cruel devil, Twala. What do you say, Good, and you, Quatermain?"

<P>&nbsp;"Well," said Good, "to adopt the language of hyperbole, in which
all these people seem to indulge, you can tell him that a row is surely
good, and warms the cockles of the heart, and that, so far as I am concerned,
I'm his boy. My only stipulation is that he allows me to wear trousers."

<P>&nbsp;I translated these answers.

<P>&nbsp;"It is well, my friends," said Ignosi, late Umbopa; "and what
say you, Macumazahn; art thou too with me, old hunter, cleverer than a
wounded buffalo?"

<P>&nbsp;I thought awhile and scratched my head.

<P>&nbsp;"Umbopa, or Ignosi," I said, "I don't like revolutions. I am a
man of peace, and a bit of a coward" (here Umbopa smiled), "but, on the
other hand, I stick to my friends, Ignosi. You have stuck to us and played
the part of a man, and I will stick to you. But, mind you, I am a trader,
and have to make my living; so I accept your offer about those diamonds,
in case we should ever be in a position to avail ourselves of it. Another
thing: we came, as you know, to look for Incubi's (Sir Henry's) lost brother.
You must help us to find him."

<P>&nbsp;"That will I do," answered Ignosi. "Stay, Infadoos; by the sign
of the snake round my middle, tell me the truth. Has any white man to thy
knowledge set his foot within the land?"

<P>&nbsp;"None, O Ignosi."

<P>&nbsp;"If any white man had been seen or heard of, wouldst thou have
known it?"

<P>&nbsp;"I should certainly have known."

<P>&nbsp;"Thou hearest, Incubu?" said Ignosi to Sir Henry; "he has not
been here."

<P>&nbsp;"Well, well," said Sir Henry, with a sigh; "there it is; I suppose
he never got here. Poor fellow, poor fellow! So it has all been for nothing.
God's will be done."

<P>&nbsp;"Now for business," I put in, anxious to escape from a painful
subject. "It is very well to be a king by right divine, Ignosi, but how
dost thou propose to become a king indeed?"

<P>&nbsp;"Nay, I know not. Infadoos, hast thou a plan?"

<P>&nbsp;"Ignosi, son of the lightning," answered his uncle, "to-night
is the great dance and witch-hunt. Many will be smelt out and perish, and
in the hears of many others there will be grief and anguish and anger against
the king Twala. When the dance is over, then will I speak to some of the
great chiefs, who in turn, if I can win them over, shall speak to their
regiments. I shall speak to the chiefs softly at first, and bring them
to see that thou art indeed the king, and I think that by to-morrow's light
thou shalt have twenty thousand spears at thy command. And now must I go
and think and hear and make ready. After the dance is done I will, if I
am yet alive, and we are all alive, meet thee here, and we will talk. At
the best there will be war."

<P>&nbsp;At this moment our conference was interrupted by the cry that
messengers had come from the king. Advancing to the door of the hut, we
ordered that they should be admitted, and presently three men entered,
each bearing a shining shirt of chain-armor and a magnificent battle-axe.

<P>&nbsp;"The gifts of my lord, the king, to the white men from the stars!"
exclaimed a herald who had come with them.

<P>&nbsp;"We thank the king," I answered; "withdraw."

<P>&nbsp;The men went, and we examined the armor with great interest. It
was the most beautiful chain-work we had ever seen. A whole coat fell together
so closely that it formed a mass of links scarcely too big to be covered
with both hands.

<P>&nbsp;"Do you make these things in this country; Infadoos?" I asked;
"they are very beautiful."

<P>&nbsp;"Nay, my. lord; they come down to us from our forefathers. We
know not who made them, and there are but few left. None but those of royal
blood may wear them. They are magic coats through which no spear can pass.
He who wears them is well-nigh safe in the battle. The king is well pleased
or much afraid, or he would not have sent them. Wear them tonight, my lords."

<P>&nbsp;The rest of the day we spent quietly resting and talking over
the situation, which was sufficiently exciting. At last the sun went down,
the thousand watch-fires glowed out, and through the darkness we heard
the tramp of many feet and the clashing of hundreds of spears as the regiments
passed to their appointed places to be ready for the great dance. About
ten the full moon came up in splendor, and as we stood watching her ascent
Infadoos arrived, clad in full war toggery, and accompanied by a guard
of twenty men to escort us to the dance. We had already, as he recommended,
donned the shirts of chain armor which the king had sent us, putting them
on under our ordinary clothing, and finding to our surprise that they were
neither very heavy nor uncomfortable. These steel shirts, which had evidently
been made for men of a very large stature, hung somewhat loosely upon Good
and myself, but Sir Henry's fitted his magnificent frame like a glove.
Then, strapping our revolvers round our waists, and taking the battle-axes
which the king had sent with the armor in our hands, we started.

<P>&nbsp;On arriving at the great kraal where we had that morning been
interviewed by the king, we found that it was closely packed with some
twenty thousand men arranged in regiments round it. The regiments were
in turn divided into companies, and between each company was a little path
to allow free passage to the witch-finders to pass up and down. Anything
more imposing than the sight that was presented by this vast and orderly
concourse of armed men it is impossible for one to conceive. There they
stood perfectly silent, and the moonlight poured its light upon the forest
of their raised spears, upon their majestic forms, waving plumes, and the
harmonious shading of their various-colored shields. Wherever we looked
was line upon line of set faces surmounted by range upon range of glittering
spears.

<P>&nbsp;"Surely," I said to Infadoos, "the whole army is here?"

<P>&nbsp;"Nay, Macumazahn," he answered, "but a third part of it. One third
part is present at this dance each year, another third part is mustered
outside in case there should be trouble when the killing begins, ten thousand
more garrison the outposts round Loo, and the rest watch at the kraals
in the country. Thou seest it is a very great people."

<P>&nbsp;"They are very silent," said Good; and, indeed, the intense stillness
among such a vast concourse of living men was almost overpowering.

<P>&nbsp;"What says Bougwan?" asked Infadoos.

<P>&nbsp;I translated.

<P>&nbsp;"Those over whom the shadow of death is hovering are silent,"
he answered, grimly.

<P>&nbsp;"Will many be killed?"

<P>&nbsp;"Very many."

<P>&nbsp;"It seems," I said to the others, "that we are going to assist
at a gladiatorial show arranged regardless of expense."

<P>&nbsp;Sir Henry shivered, and Good said that he wished that we could
get out of it.

<P>&nbsp;"Tell me," I asked Infadoos, "are we in danger?"

<P>&nbsp;"I know not, my lords - I trust not; but do not seem afraid. If
ye live through the night all may go well. The soldiers murmur against
the king."

<P>&nbsp;All this while we had been advancing steadily towards. the centre
of the open space, in the midst of which were placed some stools. As we
proceeded we perceived another small party coming from the direction of
the royal hut.

<P>&nbsp;"'It is the king, Twala, and Scragga his son, and Gagool the old,
and see, with them are those who slay," and he pointed to a little group
of about a dozen gigantic and savage-looking men, armed with spears in
one hand and heavy kerries in the other.

<P>&nbsp;The king seated himself upon the centre stool, Gagool crouched
at his feet, and the others stood behind.

<P>&nbsp;"Greeting, white lords," he cried, as we came up; "be seated,
waste not the precious time - -the night is all too short for the deeds
that must be done. Ye come in a good hour, and shall see a glorious show.
Look round white lords; look round," and he rolled his one wicked eye from
regiment to regiment. "Can the stars show ye such a sight as this? See
how they shake in their wickedness, all those who have evil in their hearts
and fear the judgment of `Heaven above.' "

<P>&nbsp;"<I>Begin! begin!</I>" cried out Gagool, in her thin, piercing
voice; "the hyenas are hungry, they howl for food. <I>Begin! begin!</I>"
Then for a moment there was intense stillness, made horrible by a presage
of what was to come.

<P>&nbsp;The king lifted his spear, and suddenly twenty thousand feet were
raised, as though they belonged to one man, and brought down with a stamp
upon the earth. This was repeated three times, causing the solid ground
to shake and tremble. Then from a far point of the circle a solitary voice
began a wailing song, of which the refrain ran something as follows:

<P>&nbsp;<I>"What is the lot of man born of woman?"</I>

<P>&nbsp;Back came the answer rolling out from every throat in that vast
company:

<P>&nbsp;<I>"Death!"</I>

<P>&nbsp;Gradually, however, the song was taken up by company after company,
till the whole armed multitude were singing it, and I could no longer follow
the words, except in so far as they appeared to represent various phases
of human passions, fears, and joys. Now it seemed to be a love-song, now
a majestic swelling war-chant, and. last of all a death-dirge, ending suddenly
in one heartbreaking wail that went echoing and rolling away in a volume
of bloodcurdling sound. Again the silence fell upon the place, and again
it was broken by the king lifting up his hand. Instantly there was a pattering
of feet, and from out of the masses of the warriors strange and awful figures
came running towards us. As they drew near we saw that they were those
of women, most of them aged, for their white hair, ornamented with small
bladders taken from fish, streamed out behind them. Their faces were painted
in stripes of white and yellow; down their backs hung snakeskins, and round
their waists rattled circlets of human bones, while each held in her shrivelled
hand a small forked wand. In all there were ten of them. When they arrived
in front of us they halted, and one of them, pointing with her wand towards
the crouching figure of Gagool, cried out:

<P>&nbsp;"Mother, old mother, we are here."

<P>&nbsp;<I>"Good! good! good</I>!" piped out that aged iniquity. "Are
your eyes keen, Isanusis"(witch doctresses), "ye seers in dark places?"

<P>&nbsp;"Mother, they are keen?"

<P>&nbsp;"<I>Good! good! good!</I> Are your ears open, Isanusis, ye who
hear words that come not from the tongue?"

<P>&nbsp;"Mother, they are open."

<P>&nbsp;"<I>Good! good! good!</I> Are your senses awake, Isanusis - can
ye smell blood, can ye purge the land of the wicked ones who compass evil
against the king and against their neighbors? Are ye ready to do the justice
of `Heaven above,' ye whom I have taught, who have eaten of the bread of,
my wisdom and drunk of the water. of my magic?"

<P>&nbsp;"Mother, we can."

<P>&nbsp;"Then go! Tarry not, ye vultures; see the slayers" - pointing
to the ominous group of executioners behind - -"make sharp their spears;
the white men from afar are hungry to see. Go."

<P>&nbsp;With a wild yell the weird party broke away in every direction,
like fragments from the shell, and, the dry bones round their waists rattling
as they ran, made direct for various points of the dense human circle.
We could not watch them all, so fixed our eyes upon the Isanusi nearest
us. When she came with a few paces of the warriors, she halted and began
to dance wildly, turning round and round with an almost incredible rapidity,
and shrieking out sentences such as "I smell him, the evil-doer!" "He is
near, he who poisoned his mother!" "I hear the thoughts of him who thought
evil of the king!"

<P>&nbsp;Quicker and quicker she danced, till she lashed herself into such
a frenzy of excitement that the foam flew in flecks from her gnashing jaws,
her eyes seemed to start from her head, and her flesh to quiver visibly.
Suddenly she stopped dead, and stiffened all over, like a pointer dog when
he scents game, and then with-outstretched wand began to creep stealthily
towards the soldiers before her. It seemed to us that as she came their
stoicism gave way, and that they shrank from her. As for ourselves, we
followed her movements with a horrible fascination. Presently, still creeping
and crouching like a dog, she was before them. Then she stopped and pointed,
and then again crept on a pace or two.

<P>&nbsp;Suddenly the end came. With a shriek she sprang in and touched
a tall warrior with the forked wand. Instantly two of his comrades, those
standing immediately next to him, seized the doomed man, each by one arm,
and advanced with him towards the, king.

<P>&nbsp;He did not resist, but we saw that he dragged his limbs as though
they were paralyzed, and his fingers, from which the spear had fallen,
were limp as those of a man newly dead.

<P>&nbsp;As he came, two of the villainous executioners stepped forward
to meet him. Presently they met, and the executioners turned round towards
the king as though for orders.

<P>&nbsp;"<I>Kill!</I>" said the king.

<P>&nbsp;"<I>Kill!</I>" squeaked Gagool.

<P>&nbsp;"<I>Kill!</I>" re-echoed Scragga, with a hollow chuckle.

<P>&nbsp;Almost before the words were uttered, the horrible deed was done.
One man had driven his spear into the victim's heart, and, to make assurance
doubly sure, the other had dashed out his brains with his great club.

<P>&nbsp;"<I>One,</I>" counted Twala, the king, just like a black Madame
Defarge, as Good said, and the body was dragged a few paces away and stretched
out.

<P>&nbsp;Hardly was this done before another poor wretch was brought up,
like an ox to the slaughter. This time we could see, from the leopard-skin
cloak, that the man was a person of rank. Again the awful syllables were
spoken, and the victim fell dead.

<P>&nbsp;"<I>Two,</I>" counted the king.

<P>&nbsp;And so the deadly game went on, till some hundred bodies were
stretched in rows behind us. I have heard of the gladiatorial shows of
the Caesars, and of the Spanish bull-fights, but I take the liberty of
doubting if they were either of them half as horrible as this Kukuana witch-hunt.
Gladiatorial shows and Spanish bull-fights, at any rate, contributed to
the public amusement, which certainly was not the case here. The most confirmed
sensation-monger would fight shy of sensation if he knew that it was well
on the cards that he would, in his own proper person, be the subject of
the next "event."

<P>&nbsp;Once we rose and tried to remonstrate, but were sternly repressed
by Twala.

<P>&nbsp;"Let the law take its course, white men. These dogs are magicians
and evildoers; it is well that they should die," was the only answer vouchsafed
to us.

<P>&nbsp;About midnight there was a pause. The witch-finders gathered themselves
together, apparently exhausted with their bloody work, and we thought that
the whole performance was done with. But it was not so, for presently,
to our surprise, the old woman, Gagool, rose from her crouching position,
and, supporting herself with a stick, staggered off into the open space.
It was an extraordinary sight to see this frightful, vulture-headed old
creature, bent nearly double with extreme age, gather strength by degrees
till at last she rushed about almost as actively as her ill-omened pupils.
To and fro she ran, chanting to herself, till suddenly she made a dash
at a tall man standing in front of one of the regiments, and touched him.
As she did so a sort of groan went up from the regiment, which he evidently
commanded. But all the same two of its members seized him and brought him
up for execution. We afterwards learned that he was a man of great wealth
and importance, being, indeed, a cousin of the king's.

<P>&nbsp;He was slain, and the king counted one hundred and three. Then
Gagool again sprang to and fro, gradually drawing nearer and nearer to
ourselves.

<P>&nbsp;"Hang me if I don't believe she is going to try her games on us,"
ejaculated Good, in horror.

<P>&nbsp;"Nonsense!" said Sir Henry.

<P>&nbsp;As for myself, as I saw that old fiend dancing nearer and nearer,
my heart positively sank into my boots. I glanced behind us at the long
rows of corpses, and shivered.

<P>&nbsp;Nearer and nearer waltzed Gagool, looking for all the world like
an animated crooked stick, her horrid eyes gleaming and glowing with a
most `unholy' lustre.

<P>&nbsp;Nearer she came, and nearer yet, every pair of eyes in that vast
assemblage watching her movements with intense anxiety. At last she stood
still and pointed.

<P>&nbsp;"Which is it to be?" asked Sir Henry, to himself.

<P>&nbsp;In a moment all doubts were set at rest, for the old woman had
rushed in and touched Umbopa, alias Ignosi, on the shoulder.

<P>&nbsp;"I smell him out," she shrieked. "Kill him, kill him, He is full-of
evil; kill him, the stranger, before blood flows for him. Slay him, O king."

<P>&nbsp;There was a pause, which I instantly took advantage of.

<P>&nbsp;"O king," I called out, rising from my seat, "this man is the
servant of thy guests, he is their dog; whosoever sheds the blood of our
dog sheds our blood. By the sacred law of hospitality I claim protection
for him."

<P>&nbsp;"Gagool, mother of the witch doctors, has smelled him out; he
must die, white men," was the sullen answer.

<P>&nbsp;"Nay, he shall not die," I replied; "he who tries to touch him
shall die indeed."

<P>&nbsp;"Seize him!" roared Twala, to the executioners, who stood around
red to the eyes with the blood of their victims.

<P>&nbsp;They advanced towards us, and then hesitated. As for Ignosi, he
raised his spear, and raised it as though determined to sell his life dearly.

<P>&nbsp;"Stand back, ye dogs," I shouted, "if ye would see to-morrow's
light. Touch one hair of his head and your king dies," and I covered Twala
with my revolver. Sir Henry and Good also drew their pistols, Sir Henry
pointing his at the leading executioner, who was advancing to carry out
the sentence, and Good taking a deliberate aim at Gagool.

<P>&nbsp;Twala winced perceptibly, as my barrel came in a line with his
broad chest.

<P>&nbsp;"Well," I said, "what is it to be, Twala?"

<P>&nbsp;Then he spoke.

<P>&nbsp;"Put away your magic tubes," he said; "ye have adjured me in the
name of hospitality, and for that reason, but not from fear of what ye
can do, I spare him. Go in peace."

<P>&nbsp;"It is well," I answered, unconcernedly; "we are weary of slaughter,
and would sleep. Is the dance ended?"

<P>&nbsp;"It is ended," Twala answered, sulkily. "Let these dogs," pointing
to the long rows of corpses, "be flung out to the hyenas and the vultures,"
and he lifted his spear.

<P>&nbsp;Instantly the regiments began in perfect silence to defile off
through the kraal gateway, a fatigue party only remaining behind to drag
away the corpses of those who had been sacrificed.

<P>&nbsp;Then we too rose, and, making our salaam to his majesty, which
he hardly deigned to acknowledge, departed to our kraal.

<P>&nbsp;"Well," said Six Henry, as we sat down, having first lit a lamp
of the sort used by the Kukuanas, of which the wick is made of the fibre
of a species of palm leaf and the oil of clarified hippopotamus fat, "well,
I feel uncommonly inclined to be sick."

<P>&nbsp;"If I had any doubts about helping Umbopa to rebel against that
infernal blackguard," put in Good, "they are gone now. It was as much as
I could do to sit still while that slaughter was going on. I tried to keep
my eyes shut, but they would open just at the wrong time. I wonder where
Infadoos is. Umbopa, my friend, you ought to be grateful to us; your skin
came near to having an air-hole made in it."

<P>&nbsp;"I am grateful, Bougwan," was Umbopa's answer, when I had translated,
"and I shall not forget. As for Infadoos, he will be here by and by. We
must wait."

<P>&nbsp;So we lit our pipes and waited.
