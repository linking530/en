CHAPTER III</H2>

<H3>
UMBOPA ENTERS OUR SERVICE</H3>
IT takes from four to five days, according to the vessel and the state
of the weather, to run up from the Cape - to Durban. Sometimes, if the
landing is bad at East London, where they have not yet got that wonderful
harbor they talk so much of and sink such a mint of money in, one is delayed
for twenty-four hours before the cargo boats can get out to take the goods
off. But on this occasion we had not to wait at all, for there were no
breakers on the bar to speak of, and the tugs came out at once with their
long strings of ugly, flat-bottomed boats, into which the goods were bundled
with a crash. It did not matter what they were, over they went, slap-bang!
whether they were china or woollen goods they met with the same treatment.
I saw one case containing four dozen of champagne smashed all to bits,
and there was the champagne fizzing and boiling about in the bottom of
the dirty cargo-boat. It was a wicked waste, and so evidently the Kaffirs
in the boat thought, for they found a couple of unbroken bottles, and knocking
the tops off drank the contents. But they had not allowed for the expansion
caused by the fizz in the wine, and feeling themselves swelling, rolled
about in the bottom of the boat, calling out that the good liquor was "tagati"
(bewitched). I spoke to them from the vessel, and told them that it was
the white man's strongest medicine, and that they were as good as dead
men. They went on to the shore in a very great fright, and I do not think
that they will touch champagne again.

<P>&nbsp;Well, all the time we were running up to Natal I was thinking
over Sir Henry Curtis's offer. We did not speak any more on the subject
for a day or two, though I told them many hunting yarns, all true ones.
There is no need to tell lies about hunting, for so many curious things
happen within the knowledge of a man whose business it is to hunt; but
this is by the way.

<P>&nbsp;At last, one beautiful evening in January, which is our hottest
month, we steamed along the coast of Natal, expecting to make Durban Point
by sunset. It is a lovely coast all along from East London, with its red
sandhills and wide sweeps of vivid green, dotted here and there with Kaffir
kraals, and bordered by a ribbon of white surf which spouts up in pillars
of foam where it hits the rocks. But just before you get to Durban there
is a peculiar richness about it. There are the deep kloofs cut in the hills
by the rushing rains of centuries, down which the rivers sparkle; there
is the deepest green of the bush, growing as God planted it, and the other
greens of the mealie-gardens and the sugar-patches, while here and there
a white house, smiling out at the placid sea, puts a finish and gives an
air of homeliness to the scene. For to my mind, however beautiful a view
may be, it requires the presence of man to make it complete, but perhaps
that is because I have lived so much in the wilderness, and therefore know
the value of civilization, though, to be sure, it drives away the game.
The Garden of Eden, no doubt, was fair before man was, but I always think
it must have been fairer when Eve was walking about it. But we had miscalculated
a little, and the sun was well down before we dropped anchor off the Point,
and heard the gun which told the good folk that the English mail was in.
It was too late to think of getting over the bar that night, so we went
down comfortably to dinner, after seeing the mail carried off in the lifeboat.

<P>&nbsp;When we came up again the moon was up, and shining so brightly
over sea and shore that she almost paled the quick, large flashes from
the lighthouse. From the shore floated sweet spicy odors that always remind
me of hymns and missionaries, and in the windows of the houses on the Berea
sparkle a hundred lights. From a large brig lying near came the music of
the sailors as they worked at getting the anchor up to be ready for the
wind. Altogether it was a perfect night, such a night as you only get in
southern Africa, and it threw a garment of peace over everybody as the
moon threw a garment of silver over everything. Even the great bulldog,
belonging to a sporting passenger, seemed to yield to the gentle influences,
and, giving up yearning to come to close quarters with the baboon in a
cage on the fo'k'sle, snored happily in the door of the cabin, dreaming,
no doubt, that he had finished him, and happy in his dream.

<P>&nbsp;We all - that is, Sir Henry Curtis, Captain Good, and myself -
went and sat by the wheel, and were quiet for a while.

<P>&nbsp;"Well, Mr. Quatermain," said Sir Henry, presently, "have you been
thinking about my proposals?"

<P>&nbsp;"Ay," echoed Captain Good, "what do you think of them, Mr. Quatermain?
I hope you are going to give us the pleasure of your company as far as
Solomon's Mines, or wherever the gentleman you knew as Neville may have
got to."

<P>&nbsp;I rose and knocked out my pipe before I answered. I had not made
up my mind, and wanted the additional moment to complete it. Before the
burning tobacco had fallen into the sea it was completed; just that little
extra second did the trick. It is often the way when you have been bothering
a long time over a thing.

<P>&nbsp;"Yes, gentlemen," I said, sitting down again, "I will go, and
by your leave I will tell you why and on what terms. First, for the terms
which I ask.

<P>&nbsp;"1. You are to pay all expenses, and any ivory or other valuables
we may get is to be divided between Captain Good and myself.

<P>&nbsp;"2. That you pay me #500 for my service on the trip before we
start, I undertaking to serve you faithfully till you choose to abandon
the enterprise, or tell we succeed, or disaster overtakes us.

<P>&nbsp;"3. That before we start you execute a deed agreeing in the event
of my death or disablement, to pay my boy Harry, who is studying medicine
over there in London at Guy's Hospital, a sum of #200 a year for five years,
by which time he ought to be able to earn a living for himself. That is
all, I think, and I dare say you will say quite enough, too."

<P>&nbsp;"No," answered Sir Henry, "I accept them gladly. I am bent upon
this project, and would pay more than that for your help, especially considering
the peculiar knowledge you possess."

<P>&nbsp;"Very well. And now that I have made my terms I will tell you
my reasons for making up my mind to go. First of all, gentlemen, I have
been observing you both for the last few days, and if you will not think
me impertinent I will say that I like you, and think that we shall come
up well to the yoke together. That is something, let me tell you, when
one has a long journey like this before one.

<P>&nbsp;"And now as to the journey itself, I tell you flatly, Sir Henry
and Captain Good, that I do not think it probable that we can come out
of it alive, that is, if we attempt to cross the Suliman Mountains. What
was the fate of the old Don da Silvestra three hundred years ago? What
was the fate of his descendant twenty years ago? What has been your brother's
fate? I tell you frankly, gentlemen, that as their fate was so I believe
ours will be."

<P>&nbsp;I paused to watch the effect of my words. Captain Good looked
a little uncomfortable; but Sir Henry's face did not change.

<P>&nbsp;"We must take our chance," he said.

<P>&nbsp;"You may perhaps wonder," I went on, "why, if I think this, I,
who am, as I told you, a timid man, should undertake such a journey. It
is for two reasons. First, I am a fatalist, and believe that my time is
appointed to come quite independently of my own movements, and that if
I am to go to Suliman Mountains to be killed, I shall go there and shall
be killed there. God Almighty, no doubt, knows his mind about me, so I
need not trouble on that account. Secondly, I am a poor man. For forty
years I have hunted and but I have never made more than a living. Well,
gentlemen, I don't know if you are aware that the average life of an elephant-hunter
from the time he takes to the trade is from four to five years. So you
see I have lived through about seven generations of my class and I should
think that my time cannot be far off, any way. Now, if anything were to
happen to me in the course of business, by the time my debts were paid
there would be nothing left to support my son Harry while he was getting
in the way of earning a living, whereas now he would be provided for for
five years. There is whole affair in a nutshell."

<P>&nbsp;"Mr. Quatermain," said Sir Henry, who had been giving me the most
serious attention, "your motives for undertaking an enterprise which you
believe can only end in disaster reflect a great deal of credit on you.
Whether or not you are right, time and the event, of course, alone can
show. But whether you are right or wrong, I may as well tell you at once
that I am going through with it to the end, sweet or bitter. If we are
going to be knocked on the head, all that I have to say is that I hope
we shall get a little shooting first - eh, Good?"

<P>&nbsp;"Yes, yes," put in the captain. "We have all three of us been
accustomed to face danger, and hold our lives in our hands in various ways,
so it is no good turning back now."

<P>&nbsp;"And now I vote we go down to the saloon and take an observation,
just for luck, you know." And we did - through the bottom of a tumbler.

<P>&nbsp;Next day we went ashore, and I put Sir Henry and Captain Good
up at the little shanty I have on the Berea, and which I call my home.
There are only three rooms and a kitchen in it, and it is built of green
brick with a galvanized iron roof, but there is a good garden, with the
best loquot-trees in it that I know, and some nice young mangoes; of which
I hope great things. The curator of the botanical gardens gave them to
me. It is looked after by an old hunter of mine, named Jack, whose thigh
was so badly broken by a buffalo cow in Sikukuni's country that he will
never hunt again. But he can potter about and garden, being a Griqua by
birth. You can never get your Zulu to take much interest in gardening.
It is a peaceful art, and peaceful arts are not in his line.

<P>&nbsp;Sir Henry and Good slept in a tent pitched in my little grove
of orange trees at the end of the garden (for there was no room for them
in the house), and what with the smell of the bloom and the sight of the
green and golden fruit - for in Durban you will see all three on the tree
together - I dare say it is a pleasant place enough (for we have few mosquitoes
here unless there happens to come an unusually heavy rain).

<P>&nbsp;Well, to get on - for unless I do you will be tired of my story
before ever we fetch up at Suliman's Mountains-having once made up my mind
to go, I set about making the necessary preparations. First I got the deed
from Sir Henry, providing for my boy in case of accidents. There was some
little difficulty about getting this legally executed, as Sir Henry was
a stranger here, and the property to be charged was over the water; but
it was ultimately got over with the help of a lawyer, who charged #20 for
the job - a price that I thought outrageous. Then I got my check for #500.
Having paid this tribute to my bump of caution, I bought a wagon and a
span of oxen on Sir Henry's behalf, and beauties they were. It was a twenty-two
foot wagon with iron axles, very strong, very light, and built throughout
of stink-wood. It was not quite a new one, having been to the Diamond Fields
and back, but in my opinion it was all the better for that, for one could
see that the wood was well-seasoned. If anything is going to give in a
wagon, or if there is green wood in it, it will show out on the first trip.
It was what we call a "half-tented" wagon - that is to say, it was only
covered in over the after twelve feet, leaving all the front part free
for the necessaries we had to carry with us. In this after part was a hide
"cattle," or bed, on which two people could sleep, also racks for rifles,
and many other little conveniences. I gave #125 for it, and think it was
cheap at the price. Then I bought a beautiful team of twenty salted Zulu
oxen, which I had had my eye on for a year or two. Sixteen oxen are the
usual number for a team, but I had four extra to allow for casualties.
These Zulu oxen are small and light, not more than half the size of the
Afrikaner oxen, which are generally used for transport purposes; but they
will live where the Afrikaner will starve, and with a light load will make
five miles a day better going, being quicker and not so liable to get footsore.
What is more, this lot were thoroughly "salted" - that is, they had worked
all over South Africa, and so had become proof (comparatively speaking)
against red water, which so frequently destroys whole teams of oxen when
they get on to strange "veldt" (grass country). As for "lung sick," which
is a dreadful form of pneumonia, very prevalent in this country, they had
all been inoculated against it. This is done by cutting a slit in the tail
of an ox, and binding in a piece of the diseased lung of an animal which
has died of the sickness. The result is that the ox sickens, takes the
disease in a mild form, which causes its tail to drop off, as a rule about
a foot from the root, and becomes proof against future attacks. It seems
cruel to rob the animal of his tail, especially in a country where there
are so many flies, but it is better to sacrifice the tail and keep the
ox than to lose both tail and ox, for a tail without an ox is not much
good except to dust with. Still it does look odd to trek along behind twenty
stumps, where there ought to be tails. It seems as though nature had made
a trifling mistake, and stuck the stem ornaments of a lot of prize bulldogs
on to the rumps of the oxen.

<P>&nbsp;Next came the question of provisioning and medicines, one which
required the most careful consideration, for what one had to do was to
avoid lumbering the wagon up, and yet take everything absolutely necessary.
Fortunately, it turned out that Good was a bit of a doctor, having at some
period in his previous career managed to pass through a course of medical
and surgical instruction, which he had more or less kept up. He was not,
of course, qualified, but he knew more about it than many a man who could
write M.D. after his name, as we found out afterwards, and he had a splendid-travelling
medicine-chest and a set of instruments. While we were at Durban he cut
off a Kaffir's big toe in a way which it was a pleasure to see. But he
was quite flabbergasted when the Kaffir, who had sat stolidly watching
the operation, asked him to put on another, saying that a "white one" would
do at a pinch.

<P>&nbsp;There remained, when these questions were satisfactorily settled,
two further important points for consideration, namely, that of arms and
that of servants. As to the arms I cannot do better than put down a list
of those we finally decided on from among the ample store that Sir Henry
had brought with him from England, and those which I had. I copy it from
my pocket-book, where I made the entry at the time:

<P>&nbsp;"Three heavy-breech loading double eight elephant guns, weighing
about fifteen pounds each, with a charge of eleven drachms of black powder."
Two of these were by a well-known London firm, most excellent makers, but
I do not know by whom mine, which was not so highly finished, was made.
I had used it on several trips, and shot a good many elephants with it,
and it had always proved a most superior weapon, thoroughly to be relied
on.

<P>&nbsp;"Three double 500 expresses, constructed to carry a charge of
six drachms," sweet weapons, and admirable for medium-sized game, such
as eland or sable antelope, or for men, especially in an open country and
with the semi-hollow bullet.

<P>&nbsp;"One double No. 12 central-fire Keeper's shotgun, full choke both
barrels." This gun. proved of the greatest service to us afterwards in
shooting game for the pot.

<P>&nbsp;"Three Winchester repeating rifles (not carbines), spare guns.

<P>&nbsp;"Three single-action Colt's revolvers, with the heavier pattern
of cartridge."

<P>&nbsp;This was our total armament, and the reader will doubtless observe
that the weapons of each class were of the same make and calibre, so that
the cartridges were interchangeable, a very important point. I make no
apology for detailing it at length, for every experienced hunter will know
how vital a proper supply of guns and ammunition is to the success of an
expedition.

<P>&nbsp;Now as to the men who were to go with us. After much consultation
we decided that their number should be limited to five, namely, a driver,
a leader, and three servants.

<P>&nbsp;The driver and leader I got without much difficulty, two Zulus,
named respectively Goza and Tom; but the servants were a more difficult
matter. It was necessary that they should be thoroughly trustworthy and
brave men, as in a business of this sort our lives might depend upon their
conduct. At last I secured two, one a Hottentot called Ventv&ouml;gel (wind-bird),
and one a little Zulu named Khiva, who had the merit of speaking English
perfectly. Ventv&ouml;gel I had known before; he was one of the most perfect
"spoorers" - (game trackers) I ever had to do with and tough as whipcord.
He never seemed to tire. But he had one failing, so common with his race,
drink. Put him within reach of a bottle of grog and you could not trust
him. But as we were going beyond the region of grog-shops this little weakness
of his did not so much matter.

<P>&nbsp;Having got these two men I looked in vain for a third to suit
my purpose, so we determined to start without one, trusting to luck to
find a suitable man on our way up country. But on the evening before the
day we had fixed for our departure the Zulu Khiva informed me that a man
was waiting to see me. Accordingly when we had done dinner, for we were
at table at the time, I told him to bring him in. Presently a very tall,
handsome-looking man, somewhere about thirty years of age, and very light-colored
for a Zulu, entered, and, lifting his knob-stick by way of salute, squatted
himself down in the corner on his haunches and sat silent. I did not take
any notice of him for a while, fop it is a great mistake to do so. If you
rush into conversation at once a Zulu is apt to think you a person of little
dignity or consideration.

<P>&nbsp;I observed, however, that he was a "Keshla" (ringed man), that
is, that he wore on his head the black ring, made of a species of gum polished
with fat and worked in with the hair, usually assumed by Zulus on attaining
a certain age or dignity. Also it struck me that his face was familiar
to me.

<P>&nbsp;"Well," I said at last, "what is your name?"

<P>&nbsp;"Umbopa," answered the man, in a slow, deep voice.

<P>&nbsp;"I have seen your face before."

<P>&nbsp;"Yes; the lnkoosi (chief) saw my face at the place of the Little
Hand (Isandhlwana) the day before the battle."

<P>&nbsp;Then I remembered. I had been one of Lord Chelmsford's guides
in that unlucky Zulu war, and had had the good fortune to leave the camp
in charge of some wagons the day before the battle. While I had been waiting
for the cattle to be inspanned I had fallen into conversation with this
man, who held some small command among the native auxiliaries, and he had
expressed to me his doubts of the safety of the camp. At the time I had
told him to hold his tongue, and leave such matters to wiser heads; but
afterwards I thought of his words.

<P>&nbsp;"I remember," I said; "what is it you want?"

<P>&nbsp;"It is this, `Macumazahn' (that is my Kaffir name, and means the
man who gets up in the middle of the night; or, in vulgar English, he who
keeps his eyes open). I hear that you go on a great expedition far into
the north with the white chiefs from over the water. Is it a true word?"

<P>&nbsp;"It is."

<P>&nbsp;"I hear that you-go even to the Lukanga River, a moon's journey
beyond the Manica country. Is this so also, `Macumazahn'?"

<P>&nbsp;"Why do you ask whither we go? What is it to thee?" I answered,
suspiciously, for the objects of our journey had been kept a dead secret.

<P>&nbsp;"It is this, O white men, that if indeed you travel so far I would
travel with you."

<P>&nbsp;There was a certain assumption of dignity in the man's mode of
speech, and especially in his use of the words "O white men," instead of
"O Inkosis" (chiefs), which struck me.

<P>&nbsp;"You forget yourself a little," I said: "Your words come out unawares.
That is not the way to speak. What is your name, and where, is your kraal?
Tell us, that we may know with whom we have to deal."

<P>&nbsp;"My name is Umbopa. I am of the Zulu people, yet not of, them.
The house of my tribe is in the far north, it was left behind when the
Zulus came down here a `thousand years ago,' long before Chaka reigned
in Zululand. I have no kraal. I have wandered for many years. I came from
the north as a child to Zululand, I was Cetywayo's man in the Nkomabakosi
regiment. I ran away from Zululand and came to Natal because I wanted to
see the white man's ways. Then I served against Cetywayo in the war. Since
then I have been working in Natal. Now I am tired, and would go north again.
Here is not my place. I want no money, but I am a brave man, and am worth
my place and meat. I have spoken."

<P>&nbsp;I was rather puzzled at this man and his way of speech. It was
evident to me from his manner that he was in the main telling the truth,
but he was somehow different from the. ordinary run of Zulus, and I rather
mistrusted his offer to come without pay. Being in a difficulty, I translated
his words to Sir Henry and Good, and asked them their opinion. Sir Henry
told me to ask him to stand up. Umbopa did so, at the same time slipping
off the long military great-coat he wore, and revealing himself naked except
for the, moocha round his centre and a necklace of lions' claws. He certainly
was a. magnificent-looking man; I never saw a finer native. Standing about
six foot three high, he was broad in proportion, and very shapely. In that
light, too, his skin looked scarcely more than dark, except here and there
where deep, black scars marked old assegai wounds. Sir Henry walked up
to him and looked into his proud, handsome face.

<P>&nbsp;"They make a good pair, don't they?" said Good; "one as big as
the other."

<P>&nbsp;"I like your looks, Mr. Umbopa, and I will take you as my servant,"
said Sir Henry in English.

<P>&nbsp;Umbopa evidently understood for he answered in Zulu, "It is well";
and then, with a glance at the white man's great stature and breadth, "we
are men, you and I."
