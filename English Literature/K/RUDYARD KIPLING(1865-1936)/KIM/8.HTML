<BR>But most to Allah Who gave me two

`Then in God's name take blue for red,' said Mahbub, alluding to the Hindu
colour of Kim's disreputable turban.

<P>Kim countered with the old proverb, `I will change my faith and my bedding,
but <I>thou</I> must pay for it.'

<P>The dealer laughed till he nearly fell from his horse. At a shop on
the outskirts of the city the change was made, and Kim stood up, externally
at least, a Mohammedan.

<P>Mahbub hired a room over against the railway station, sent for a cooked
meal of the finest with the almond-curd sweet-meats [<I>balushai</I> we
call it] and fine-chopped Lucknow tobacco.

<P>`This is better than some other meat that I ate with the Sikh,' said
Kim, grinning as he squatted, `and assuredly they give no such victuals
at my <I>madrissah</I>.'

<P>`I have a desire to hear of that same <I>madrissah</I>.' Mahbub stuffed
himself with great boluses of spiced mutton fried in fat with cabbage and
golden-brown onIons. `But tell me first, altogether and truthfully, the
manner of thy escape. For, O Friend of all the World,' - he loosed his
cracking belt - `I do not think it is often that a Sahib and the son of
a Sahib runs away from there.'

<P>`How should they? They do not know the land. It was nothing,' said Kim,
and began his tale. When he came to the disguisement and the interview
with the girl in the bazar, Mahbub Ali's gravity went from him. He laughed
aloud and beat his hand on his thigh.

<P>`<I>Shabash! Shabash</I>! Oh, well done, little one! What will the healer
of turquoises say to this? Now, slowly, let us hear what befell afterwards
step by step, omitting nothing.'

<P>Step by step then, Kim told his adventures between coughs as the full-flavoured
tobacco caught his lungs.

<P>`I said,' growled Mahbub Ali to himself, `I <I>said</I> it was the pony
breaking out to play polo. The fruit is ripe already - except that he must
learn his distances and his pacings, and his rods and his compasses. Listen
now. I have turned aside the Colonel's whip from thy skin, and that is
no small service.'

<P>`True.' Kim pulled serenely. `That is true.'

<P>`But it is not to be thought that this running out and in is any way
good.'

<P>`It was my holiday, Hajji. I was a slave for many weeks. Why should
I not run away when the school was shut? Look, too, how I, living upon
my friends or working for my bread, as I did with the Sikh, have saved
the Colonel Sahib a great expense.

<P>Mahbub's lips twitched under his well-pruned Mohammedan moustache.

<P>`What are a few rupees` - the Pathan threw out his open hand carelessly
- `to the Colonel Sahib? He spends them for a purpose, not in any way for
love of thee.'

<P>`That,' said Kim slowly, `I knew a very long time ago.'

<P>`Who told?'

<P>`The Colonel Sahib himself. Not in those many words, but plainly enough
for one who is not altogether a mud-head. Yea, he told me in the <I>te-rain</I>
when we went down to Lucknow.'

<P>`Be it so. Then I will tell thee more, Friend of all the World, though
in the telling I lend thee my head.'

<P>`It was forfeit to me,' said Kim, with deep relish, `in Umballa, when
thou didst pick me up on the horse after the drummer-boy beat me.'

<P>`Speak a little plainer. All the world may tell lies save thou and I.
For equally is thy life forfeit to me if I chose to raise my finger here.'

<P>`And this is known to me also,' said Kim, readjusting the live charcoal-ball
on the weed. `It is a very sure tie between us. Indeed, thy hold is surer
even than mine; for who would miss a boy beaten to death, or, it may be,
thrown into a well by the roadside? Most people here and in Simla and across
the passes behind the Hills would, on the other hand, say: `What has come
to Mahbub Ali?' if he were found dead among his horses. Surely, too, the
Colonel Sahib would make inquiries. But again,' - Kim's face puckered with
cunning, - `he would not make overlong inquiry, lest people should ask:
`What has this Colonel Sahib to do with that horse-dealer?' But I - if
I lived - '

<P>`As thou wouldst surely die - '

<P>`Maybe; but I say, <I>if</I> I lived, I, and I alone, would know that
one had come by night, as a common thief perhaps, to Mahbub Ali's bulkhead
in the serai, and there had slain him, either before or after that thief
had made a full search into his saddlebags and between the soles of his
slippers. Is that news to tell to the Colonel, or would he say to me -
(I have not forgotten when he sent me back for a cigar-case that he had
<I>not</I> left behind him) - `What is Mahbub Ali to me?'?'

<P>Up went a gout of heavy smoke. There was a long pause: then Mahbub Ali
spoke in admiration: `And with these things on thy mind, dost thou lie
down and rise again among all the Sahibs' little sons at the <I>madrissah</I>
and meekly take instruction from thy teachers?'

<P>`It is an order,' said Kim blandly. `Who am I to dispute an order?'

<P>`A most finished Son of Eblis,' said Mahbub Ali. `But what is this tale
of the thief and the search?'

<P>`That which I saw,' said Kim, `the night that my lama and I lay next
thy place in the Kashmir Serai. The door was left unlocked, which I think
is not thy custom, Mahbub. He came in as one assured that thou wouldst
not soon return. My eye was against a knot-hole in the plank. He searched
as it were for something - not a rug, not stirrups, nor a bridle, nor brass
pots - something little and most carefully hid. Else why did he prick with
an iron between the soles of thy slippers?'

<P>`Ha!' Mahbub Ali smiled gently. `And seeing these things, what tale
didst thou fashion to thyself; Well of the Truth?'

<P>`None. I put my hand upon my amulet, which lies always next to my skin,
and, remembering the pedigree of a white stallion that I had bitten out
of a piece of Mussalmani bread, I went away to Umballa perceiving that
a heavy trust was laid upon me. At that hour, had I chosen, thy head was
forfeit. It needed only to say to that man, `I have here a paper concerning
a horse which I cannot read.' And then?' Kim peered at Mahbub under his
eyebrows.

<P>`Then thou wouldst have drunk water twice - perhaps thrice, afterwards.
I do not think more than thrice,' said Mahbub simply.

<P>`It is true. I thought of that a little, but most I thought that I loved
thee, Mahbub. Therefore I went to Umballa, as thou knowest, but (and this
thou dost not know) I lay hid in the garden-grass to see what Colonel Creighton
Sahib might do upon reading the white stallion's pedigree.'

<P>`And what did he?' for Kim had bitten off the conversation.

<P>`Dost <I>thou</I> give news for love, or dost thou sell it?' Kim asked.

<P>`I sell and - I buy.' Mahbub took a four-anna piece out of his belt
and held it up.

<P>`Eight!' said Kim, mechanically following the huckster instinct of the
East.

<P>Mahbub laughed, and put away the coin. `It is too easy to deal in that
market, Friend of all the World. Tell me for love. Our lives lie in each
other's hand.'

<P>`Very good. I saw the <I>Jang-i-Lat Sahib</I> [the Commander-in-Chief]
come to a big dinner. I saw him in Creighton Sahib's office. I saw the
two read the white stallion's pedigree. I heard the very orders given for
the opening of a great war.'

<P>`Hah!' Mahbub nodded with deepest eyes afire. `The game is well played.
That war is done now, and the evil, we hope, nipped before the flower -
thanks to me - and thee. What didst thou later?'

<P>`I made the news as it were a hook to catch me victual and honour among
the villagers in a village whose priest drugged my lama. But I bore away
the old man's purse, and the Brahmin found nothing. So next morning he
was angry. Ho! Ho! And I also used the news when I fell into the hands
of that white Regiment with their Bull!'

<P>`That was foolishness.' Mahbub scowled. `News is not meant to be thrown
about like dung-cakes, but used sparingly - like <I>bhang</I>.'

<P>`So I think now, and moreover, it did me no sort of good. But that was
very long ago,' he made as to brush it all away with a thin brown hand
- `and since then, and especially in the nights under the <I>punkah</I>
at the <I>madrissah</I>, I have thought very greatly.'

<P>`Is it permitted to ask whither the Heaven-born's thought might have
led?' said Mahbub, with an elaborate sarcasm, smoothing his scarlet beard.

<P>`It is permitted,' said Kim, and threw back the very tone. `They say
at Nucklao that no Sahib must tell a black man that he has made a fault.'

<P>Mahbub's hand shot into his bosom, for to call a Pathan a <I>black man</I>
[<I>kala admi</I>] is a blood-insult. Then he remembered and laughed. `Speak,
Sahib. Thy black man hears.'

<P>`But,' said Kim, `I am <I>not</I> a Sahib, and I say I made a fault
to curse thee, Mahbub Ali, on that day at Umballa when I thought I was
betrayed by a Pathan. I was senseless; for I was but newly caught, and
I wished to kill that low-caste drummer-boy. I say now, Hajji, that it
was well done; and I see my road all clear before me to a good service.
I will stay in the <I>madrissah</I> till I am ripe.'

<P>`Well said. Especially are distances and numbers and the manner of using
compasses to be learned in that game. One waits in the Hills above to show
thee.'

<P>`I will learn their teaching upon a condition - that my time is given
to me without question when the <I>madrissah</I> is shut. Ask that for
me of the Colonel.'

<P>`But why not ask the Colonel in the Sahibs' tongue?'

<P>`The Colonel is the servant of the Government. He is sent hither and
yon at a word, and must consider his own advancement. (See how much I have
already learned at Nucklao!) Moreover, the Colonel I know since three months
only. I have known one Mahbub Ali for six years. So! To the <I>madrissah</I>
I will go. At the <I>madrissah</I> I will learn. In the <I>madrissah</I>
I will be a Sahib. But when the <I>madrissah</I> is shut, then must I be
free and go among my people. Otherwise I die!'

<P>`And who are thy people, Friend of all the World?'

<P>`This great and beautiful land,' said Kim, waving his paw round the
little clay-walled room where the oil-lamp in its niche burned heavily
through the tobacco-smoke. `And, further, I would see my lama again. And,
further, I need money.'

<P>`That is the need of everyone,' said Mahbub ruefully. `I will give thee
eight annas, for much money is not picked out of horses' hooves, and it
must suffice for many days. As to all the rest, I am well pleased, and
no further talk is needed. Make haste to learn, and in three years, or
it may be less, thou wilt be an aid - even to me.

<P>`Have I been such a hindrance till now?' said Kim, with a boy's giggle.

<P>`Do not give answers,' Mahbub grunted. `Thou art my new horse-boy. Go
and bed among my men. They are near the north end of the station, with
the horses.'

<P>`They will beat me to the south end of the station if I come without
authority.'

<P>Mahbub felt in his belt, wetted his thumb on a cake of Chinese ink,
and dabbed the impression on a piece of soft native paper. From Balkh to
Bombay men know that rough-ridged print with the old scar running diagonally
across it.

<P>`That is enough to show my headman. I come in the morning.'

<P>`By which road?' said Kim.

<P>`By the road from the city. There is but one, and then we return to
Creighton Sahib. I have saved thee a beating.'

<P>`Allah! What is a beating when the very head is loose on the shoulders?'

<P>Kim slid out quietly into the night, walked half round the house, keeping
close to the walls, and headed away from the station for a mile or so.
Then, fetching a wide compass, he worked back at leisure, for he needed
time to invent a story if any of Mahbub's retainers asked questions.

<P>They were camped on a piece of waste ground beside the railway, and,
being natives, had not, of course, unloaded the two trucks in which Mahbub's
animals stood among a consignment of country-breds bought by the Bombay
tram-company. The headman, a broken-down, consumptive-looking Mohammedan,
promptly challenged Kim, but was pacified at sight of Mahbub's sign-manual.

<P>`The Hajji has of his favour given me service,' said Kim testily. `If
this be doubted, wait till he comes in the morning. Meantime, a place by
the fire.'

<P>Followed the usual aimless babble that every low-caste native must raise
on every occasion. It died down, and Kim lay out behind the little knot
of Mahbub's followers, almost under the wheels of a horse-truck, a borrowed
blanket for covering. Now a bed among brickbats and ballast-refuse on a
damp night, between overcrowded horses and unwashed Baltis, would not appeal
to many white boys; but Kim was utterly happy. Change of scene, service,
and surroundings were the breath of his little nostrils, and thinking of
the neat white cots of St Xavier's all arow under the punkah gave him joy
as keen as the repetition of the multiplication-table in English.

<P>`I am very old,' he thought sleepily. `Every month I become a year more
old. I was very young, and a fool to boot, when I took Mahbub's message
to Umballa. Even when I was with that white Regiment I was very young and
small and had no wisdom. But now I learn every day, and in three years
the Colonel will take me out of the <I>madrissah</I> and let me go upon
the Road with Mahbub hunting for horses' pedigrees, or maybe I shall go
by myself; or maybe I shall find the lama and go with him. Yes; that is
best. To walk again as a <I>chela</I> with my lama when he comes back to
Benares.' The thoughts came more slowly and disconnectedly. He was plunging
into a beautiful dreamland when his ears caught a whisper, thin and sharp,
above the monotonous babble round the fire. It came from behind the iron-skinned
horse-truck.

<P>`He is not here, then?'

<P>`Where should he be but roystering in the city. Who looks for a rat
in a frog-pond? Come away. He is not our man.'

<P>`He must not go back beyond the Passes a second time. It is the order.'

<P>`Hire some woman to drug him. It is a few rupees only, and there is
no evidence.'

<P>`Except the woman. It must be more certain; and remember the price upon
his head.'

<P>`Ay, but the police have a long arm, and we are far from the Border.
If it were in Peshawur, now!'

<P>`Yes - in Peshawur,' the second voice sneered. `Peshawur, full of his
blood-kin - full of bolt-holes and women behind whose clothes he will hide.
Yes, Peshawur or Jehannum would suit us equally well.'

<P>`Then what is the plan?'

<P>`O fool, have I not told it a hundred times? Wait till he comes to lie
down, and then one sure shot. The trucks are between us and pursuit. We
have but to run back over the lines and go our way. They will not see whence
the shot came. Wait here at least till the dawn. What manner of <I>fakir</I>
art thou, to shiver at a little watching?'

<P>`Oho!' thought Kim, behind close-shut eyes. `Once again it is Mahbub.
Indeed a white stallion's pedigree is not a good thing to peddle to Sahibs!
Or maybe Mahbub has been selling other news. Now what is to do, Kim? I
know not where Mahbub houses, and if he comes here before the dawn they
will shoot him. That would be no profit for thee, Kim. And this is not
a matter for the police. That would be no profit for Mahbub; and' - he
giggled almost aloud - `I do not remember any lesson at Nucklao which will
help me. Allah! Here is Kim and yonder are they. First, then, Kim must
wake and go away, so that they shall not suspect. A bad dream wakes a man
- thus - '

<P>He threw the blanket off his face, and raised himself suddenly with
the terrible, bubbling, meaningless yell of the Asiatic roused by nightmare.

<P>`Urr-urr-urr-urr! Ya-la-la-la-la! <I>Narain</I>! The <I>churel</I>!
The <I>churel</I>!'

<P>A <I>churel</I> is the peculiarly malignant ghost of a woman who has
died in child-bed. She haunts lonely roads, her feet are turned backwards
on the ankles, and she leads men to torment.

<P>Louder rose Kim's quavering howl, till at last he leaped to his feet
and staggered off sleepily, while the camp cursed him for waking them.
Some twenty yards farther up the line he lay down again, taking care that
the whisperers should hear his grunts and groans as he recomposed himself.
After a few minutes he rolled towards the road and stole away into the
thick darkness.

<P>He paddled along swiftly till he came to a culvert, and dropped behind
it, his chin on a level with the coping-stone. Here he could command all
the night-traffic, himself unseen.

<P>Two or three carts passed, jingling out to the suburbs; a coughing policeman
and a hurrying foot-passenger or two who sang to keep off evil spirits.
Then rapped the shod feet of a horse.

<P>`Ah! This is more like Mahbub,' thought Kim, as the beast shied at the
little head above the culvert.

<P>`Ohe, Mahbub Ali,' he whispered, `have a care!'

<P>The horse was reined back almost on its haunches, and forced towards
the culvert.

<P>`Never again,' said Mahbub, `will I take a shod horse for night-work.
They pick up all the bones and nails in the city.' He stooped to lift its
forefoot, and that brought his head within a foot of Kim's. `Down - keep
down,' he muttered. `The night is full of eyes.'

<P>`Two men wait thy coming behind the horse-trucks. They will shoot thee
at thy lying down, because there is a price on thy head. I heard, sleeping
near the horses.'

<P>`Didst thou see them?... Hold still, Sire of Devils!' This furiously
to the horse.

<P>`No.'

<P>`Was one dressed belike as a <I>fakir</I>?'

<P>`One said to the other, `What manner of <I>fakir</I> art thou, to shiver
at a little watching?''

<P>`Good. Go back to the camp and lie down. I do not die tonight.'

<P>Mahbub wheeled his horse and vanished. Kim tore back down the ditch
till he reached a point opposite his second resting-place, slipped across
the road like a weasel, and re-coiled himself in the blanket.

<P>`At least Mahbub knows,' he thought contentedly. `And certainly he spoke
as one expecting it. I do not think those two men will profit by tonight's
watch.'

<P>An hour passed, and, with the best will in the world to keep awake all
night, he slept deeply. Now and again a night train roared along the metals
within twenty feet of him; but he had all the Oriental's indifference to
mere noise, and it did not even weave a dream through his slumber.

<P>Mahbub was anything but asleep. It annoyed him vehemently that people
outside his tribe and unaffected by his casual amours should pursue him
for the life. His first and natural impulse was to cross the line lower
down, work up again, and, catching his well-wishers from behind, summarily
slay them. Here, he reflected with sorrow, another branch of the Government,
totally unconnected with Colonel Creighton, might demand explanations which
would be hard to supply; and he knew that south of the Border a perfectly
ridiculous fuss is made about a corpse or so. He had not been troubled
in this way since he sent Kim to Umballa with the message, and hoped that
suspicion had been finally diverted.

<P>Then a most brilliant notion struck him.

<P>`The English do eternally tell the truth,' he said, `therefore we of
this country are eternally made foolish. By Allah, I will tell the truth
to an Englishman! Of what use is the Government police if a poor Kabuli
be robbed of his horses in their very trucks. This is as bad as Peshawur!
I should lay a complaint at the station. Better still, some young Sahib
on the Railway! They are zealous, and if they catch thieves it is remembered
to their honour.'

<P>He tied up his horse outside the station, and strode on to the platform.

<P>`Hullo, Mahbub Ali!' said a young Assistant District Traffic Superintendent
who was waiting to go down the line - a tall, tow-haired, horsey youth
in dingy white linen. `What are you doing here? Selling weeds - eh?'

<P>`No; I am not troubled for my horses. I come to look for Lutuf Ullah.
I have a truck-load up the line. Could anyone take them out without the
Railway's knowledge?'

<P>`Shouldn't think so, Mahbub. You can claim against us if they do.'

<P>`I have seen two men crouching under the wheels of one of the trucks
nearly all night. <I>fakirs</I> do not steal horses, so I gave them no
more thought. I would find Lutuf Ullah, my partner.'

<P>`The deuce you did? And you didn't bother your head about it? 'Pon my
word, it's just almost as well that I met you. What were they like, eh?'

<P>`They were only <I>fakirs</I>. They will no more than take a little
grain, perhaps, from one of the trucks. There are many up the line. The
State will never miss the dole. I came here seeking for my partner, Lutuf
Ullah - '

<P>`Never mind your partner. Where are your horse-trucks?'

<P>`A little to this side of the farthest place where they make lamps for
the trains.'

<P>`The signal-box! Yes.'

<P>`And upon the rail nearest to the road upon the right-hand side - looking
up the line thus. But as regards Lutuf Ullah - a tall man with a broken
nose, and a Persian greyhound - Aie!'

<P>The boy had hurried off to wake up a young and enthusiastic policeman;
for, as he said, the Railway had suffered much from depredations in the
goods-yard. Mahbub Ali chuckled in his dyed beard.

<P>`They will walk in their boots, making a noise, and then they will wonder
why there are no <I>fakirs</I>. They are very clever boys - Barton Sahib
and Young Sahib.'

<P>He waited idly for a few minutes, expecting to see them hurry up the
line girt for action. A light engine slid through the station, and he caught
a glimpse of young Barton in the cab.

<P>`I did that child an injustice. He is not altogether a fool,' said Mahbub
Ali. `To take a fire-carriage for a thief is a new game!'

<P>When Mahbub Ali came to his camp in the dawn, no one thought it worth
while to tell him any news of the night. No one, at least, but one small
horseboy, newly advanced to the great man's service, whom Mahbub called
to his tiny tent to assist in some packing.

<P>`It is all known to me,' whispered Kim, bending above saddlebags. `Two
Sahibs came up on a <I>te-train</I>. I was running to and fro in the dark
on this side of the trucks as the <I>te-train</I> moved up and down slowly.
They fell upon two men sitting under this truck - Hajji, what shall I do
with this lump of tobacco? Wrap it in paper and put it under the salt-bag?
Yes - and struck them down. But one man struck at a Sahib with a <I>fakir's</I>
buck's horn' (Kim meant the conjoined black-buck horns, which are a <I>fakir's</I>
sole temporal weapon) - `the blood came. So the other Sahib, first smiting
his own man senseless, smote the stabber with a short gun which had rolled
from the first man's hand. They all raged as though mad together.'

<P>Mahbub smiled with heavenly resignation. `No! That is not so much <I>dewanee</I>
[madness, or a case for the civil court - the word can be punned upon both
ways] as <I>nizamut</I> [a criminal case]. A gun, sayest thou? Ten good
years in jail.'

<P>`Then they both lay still, but I think they were nearly dead when they
were put on the <I>te-train</I>. Their heads moved thus. And there is much
blood on the line. Come and see?'

<P>`I have seen blood before. Jail is the sure place - and assuredly they
will give false names, and assuredly no man will find them for a long time.
They were unfriends of mine. Thy fate and mine seem on one string. What
a tale for the healer of pearls! Now swiftly with the saddle-bags and the
cooking-platter. We will take out the horses and away to Simla.'

<P>Swiftly - as Orientals understand speed - with long explanations, with
abuse and windy talk, carelessly, amid a hundred checks for little things
forgotten, the untidy camp broke up and led the half-dozen stiff and fretful
horses along the Kalka road in the fresh of the rain-swept dawn. Kim, regarded
as Mahbub Ali's favourite by all who wished to stand well with the Pathan,
was not called upon to work. They strolled on by the easiest of stages,
halting every few hours at a wayside shelter. Very many Sahibs travel along
the Kalka road; and, as Mahbub Ali says, every young Sahib must needs esteem
himself a judge of a horse, and, though he be over head in debt to the
money-lender, must make as if to buy. That was the reason that Sahib after
Sahib, rolling along in a stage-carriage, would stop and open talk. Some
would even descend from their vehicles and feel the horses' legs; asking
inane questions, or, through sheer ignorance of the vernacular, grossly
insulting the imperturbable trader.

<P>`When first I dealt with Sahibs, and that was when Colonel Soady Sahib
was Governor of Fort Abazai and flooded the Commissioner's camping-ground
for spite,' Mahbub confided to Kim as the boy filled his pipe under a tree,
`I did not know how greatly they were fools, and this made me wroth. As
thus - ' and he told Kim a tale of an expression, misused in all innocence,
that doubled Kim up with mirth. `Now I see, however,' - he exhaled smoke
slowly - `that it is with them as with all men - in certain matters they
are wise, and in others most foolish. Very foolish it is to use the wrong
word to a stranger; for though the heart may be clean of offence, how is
the stranger to know that? He is more like to search truth with a dagger.'

<P>`True. True talk,' said Kim solemnly. `Fools speak of a cat when a woman
is brought to bed, for instance. I have heard them.'

<P>`Therefore, in one situate as thou art, it particularly behoves thee
to remember this with both kinds of faces. Among Sahibs, never forgetting
thou art a Sahib; among the folk of Hind, always remembering thou art -
' He paused, with a puzzled smile.

<P>`What am I? Mussalman, Hindu, Jain, or Buddhist? That is a hard knot.'

<P>`Thou art beyond question an unbeliever, and therefore thou wilt be
damned. So says my Law - or I think it does. But thou art also my Little
Friend of all the World, and I love thee. So says my heart. This matter
of creeds is like horseflesh. The wise man knows horses are good - that
there is a profit to be made from all; and for myself - but that I am a
good <I>Sunni</I> and hate the men of Tirah - I could believe the same
of all the Faiths. Now manifestly a Kathiawar mare taken from the sands
of her birthplace and removed to the west of Bengal founders - nor is even
a Balkh stallion (and there are no better horses than those of Balkh, were
they not so heavy in the shoulder) of any account in the great Northern
deserts beside the snow-camels I have seen. Therefore I say in my heart
the Faiths are like the horses. Each has merit in its own country.'

<P>`But my lama said altogether a different thing.'

<P>`Oh, he is an old dreamer of dreams from Bhotiyal. My heart is a little
angry, Friend of all the World, that thou shouldst see such worth in a
man so little known.'

<P>`It is true, Hajji; but that worth do I see, and to him my heart is
drawn.'

<P>`And his to thine, I hear. Hearts are like horses. They come and they
go against bit or spur. Shout Gul Sher Khan yonder to drive in that bay
stallion's pickets more firmly. We do not want a horse-fight at every resting-stage,
and the dun and the black will be locked in a little... Now hear me. Is
it necessary to the comfort of thy heart to see that lama?'

<P>`It is one part of my bond,' said Kim. `If I do not see him, and if
he is taken from me, I will go out of that <I>madrissah</I> in Nucklao
and, and - once gone, who is to find me again?'

<P>`It is true. Never was colt held on a lighter heel-rope than thou.'
Mahbub nodded his head.

<P>`Do not be afraid.' Kim spoke as though he could have evanished on the
moment. `My lama has said that he will come to see me at the <I>madrissah</I>
- '

<P>`A beggar and his bowl in the presence of those young Sa - '

<P>`Not all!' Kim cut in with a snort. `Their eyes are blued and their
nails are blackened with low-caste blood, many of them. Sons of <I>mehteranees</I>
- brothers-in-law to the <I>bhungi</I> [sweeper].'

<P>We need not follow the rest of the pedigree; but Kim made his little
point clearly and without heat, chewing a piece of sugar-cane the while.

<P>`Friend of all the World,' said Mahbub, pushing over the pipe for the
boy to clean, `I have met many men, women, and boys, and not a few Sahibs.
I have never in all my days met such an imp as thou art.'

<P>`And why? When I always tell thee the truth.'

<P>`Perhaps the very reason, for this is a world of danger to honest men.'
Mahbub Ali hauled himself off the ground, girt in his belt, and went over
to the horses.

<P>`Or sell it?'

<P>There was that in the tone that made Mahbub halt and turn. `What new
devilry?'

<P>`Eight annas, and I will tell,' said Kim, grinning. `It touches thy
peace.'

<P>`O <I>Shaitan</I>!' Mahbub gave the money.

<P>`Rememberest thou the little business of the thieves in the dark, down
yonder at Umballa?'

<P>`Seeing they sought my life, I have not altogether forgotten. Why?'

<P>`Rememberest thou the Kashmir Serai?'

<P>`I will twist thy ears in a moment - Sahib.'

<P>`No need - Pathan. Only, the second <I>fakir</I>, whom the Sahibs beat
senseless, was the man who came to search thy bulkhead at Lahore. I saw
his face as they helped him on the engine. The very same man.'

<P>`Why didst thou not tell before?'

<P>`Oh, he will go to jail, and be safe for some years. There is no need
to tell more than is necessary at any one time. Besides, I did not then
need money for sweetmeats.'

<P>`<I>Allah kerim</I>!' said Mahbub Ali. `Wilt thou some day sell my head
for a few sweetmeats if the fit takes thee?'&nbsp;
<HR>Kim will remember till he dies that long, lazy journey from Umballa,
through Kalka and the Pinjore Gardens near by, up to Simla. A sudden spate
in the Gugger River swept down one horse (the most valuable, be sure),
and nearly drowned Kim among the dancing boulders. Farther up the road
the horses were stampeded by a Government elephant, and being in high condition
of grass food, it cost a day and a half to get them together again. Then
they met Sikandar Khan coming down with a few unsaleable screws - remnants
of his string - and Mahbub, who has more of horse-coping in his little
fingernail than Sikandar Khan in all his tents, must needs buy two of the
worst, and that meant eight hours' laborious diplomacy and untold tobacco.
But it was all pure delight - the wandering road, climbing, dipping, and
sweeping about the growing spurs; the flush of the morning laid along the
distant snows; the branched cacti, tier upon tier on the stony hillsides;
the voices of a thousand water-channels; the chatter of the monkeys; the
solemn deodars, climbing one after another with down-drooped branches;
the vista of the Plains rolled out far beneath them; the incessant twanging
of the tonga-horns and the wild rush of the led horses when a tonga swung
round a curve; the halts for prayers (Mahbub was very religious in dry-washings
and bellowings when time did not press); the evening conferences by the
halting-places, when camels and bullocks chewed solemnly together and the
stolid drivers told the news of the Road - all these things lifted Kim's
heart to song within him.

<P>`But, when the singing and dancing is done,' said Mahbub Ali, `comes
the Colonel Sahib's, and that is not so sweet.'

<P>`A fair land - a most beautiful land is this of Hind - and the land
of the Five Rivers is fairer than all,' Kim half chanted. `Into it I will
go again if Mahbub Ali or the Colonel lift hand or foot against me. Once
gone, who shall find me? Look, Hajji, is yonder the city of Simla? Allah,
what a city!'

<P>`My father's brother, and he was an old man when Mackerson Sahib's well
was new at Peshawur, could recall when there were but two houses in it.'

<P>He led the horses below the main road into the lower Simla bazar - the
crowded rabbit-warren that climbs up from the valley to the Town Hall at
an angle of forty-five. A man who knows his way there can defy all the
police of India's summer capital, so cunningly does veranda communicate
with veranda, alley-way with alley-way, and bolt-hole with bolt-hole. Here
live those who minister to the wants of the glad city - <I>jhampanis</I>
who pull the pretty ladies' `rickshaws by night and gamble till the dawn;
grocers, oil-sellers, curio-vendors, firewood-dealers, priests, pickpockets,
and native employees of the Government. Here are discussed by courtesans
the things which are supposed to be profoundest secrets of the India Council;
and here gather all the sub-sub-agents of half the Native States. Here,
too, Mahbub Ali rented a room, much more securely locked than his bulkhead
at Lahore, in the house of a Mohammedan cattle-dealer. It was a place of
miracles, too, for there went in at twilight a Mohammedan horseboy, and
there came out an hour later a Eurasian lad - the Lucknow girl's dye was
of the best - in badly-fitting shop-clothes.

<P>`I have spoken with Creighton Sahib,' quoth Mahbub Ali, `and a second
time has the Hand of Friendship averted the Whip of Calamity. He says that
thou hast altogether wasted sixty days upon the Road, and it is too late,
therefore, to send thee to any Hill-school.'

<P>`I have said that my holidays are my own. I do not go to school twice
over. That is one part of my bond.'

<P>`The Colonel Sahib is not yet aware of that contract. Thou art to lodge
in Lurgan Sahib's house till it is time to go again to Nucklao.'

<P>`I had sooner lodge with thee, Mahbub.'

<P>`Thou dost not know the honour. Lurgan Sahib himself asked for thee.
Thou wilt go up the hill and along the road atop, and there thou must forget
for a while that thou hast ever seen or spoken to me, Mahbub Ali, who sells
horses to Creighton Sahib, whom thou dost not know. Remember this order.'

<P>Kim nodded. `Good,' said he, `and who is Lurgan Sahib? Nay' - he caught
Mahbub's sword-keen glance - `indeed I have never heard his name. Is he
by chance' - he lowered his voice - `one of us?'

<P>`What talk is this of <I>us</I>, Sahib?' Mahbub Ali returned, in the
tone he used towards Europeans. `I am a Pathan; thou art a Sahib and the
son of a Sahib. Lurgan Sahib has a shop among the European shops. All Simla
knows it. Ask there... and, Friend of all the World, he is one to be obeyed
to the last wink of his eyelashes. Men say he does magic, but that should
not touch thee. Go up the hill and ask. Here begins the Great Game.'
