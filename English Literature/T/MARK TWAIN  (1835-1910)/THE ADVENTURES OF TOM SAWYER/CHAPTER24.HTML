TOM was a glittering hero once more -- the pet of the old, the envy of
the young. His name even went into immortal print, for the village paper
magnified him. There were some that believed he would be President, yet,
if he escaped hanging.

<P>&nbsp;As usual, the fickle, unreasoning world took Muff Potter to its
bosom and fondled him as lavishly as it had abused him before. But that
sort of conduct is to the world's credit; therefore it is not well to find
fault with it.

<P>&nbsp;Tom's days were days of splendor and exultation to him, but his
nights were seasons of horror. Injun Joe infested all his dreams, and always
with doom in his eye. Hardly any temptation could persuade the boy to stir
abroad after nightfall. Poor Huck was in the same state of wretchedness
and terror, for Tom had told the whole story to the lawyer the night before
the great day of the trial, and Huck was sore afraid that his share in
the business might leak out, yet, notwithstanding Injun Joe's flight had
saved him the suffering of testifying in court. The poor fellow had got
the attorney to promise secrecy, but what of that? Since Tom's harassed
conscience had managed to drive him to the lawyer's house by night and
wring a dread tale from lips that had been sealed with the dismalest and
most formidable of oaths, Huck's confidence in the human race was well-nigh
obliterated.

<P>&nbsp;Daily Muff Potter's gratitude made Tom glad he had spoken; but
nightly he wished he had sealed up his tongue.

<P>&nbsp;Half the time Tom was afraid Injun Joe would never be captured;
the other half he was afraid he would be. He felt sure he never could draw
a safe breath again until that man was dead and he had seen the corpse.

<P>&nbsp;Rewards had been offered, the country had been scoured, but no
Injun Joe was found. One of those omniscient and awe-inspiring marvels,
a detective, came up from St. Louis, moused around, shook his head, looked
wise, and made that sort of astounding success which members of that craft
usually achieve. That is to say, he "found a clew." But you can't hang
a "clew" for murder, and so after that detective had got through and gone
home, Tom felt just as insecure as he was before.

<P>&nbsp;The slow days drifted on, and each left behind it a slightly lightened
weight of apprehension.
