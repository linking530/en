CHAPTER I.

AN INVITATION FOR TOM AND HUCK



[Footnote:  Strange as the incidents of this story are,

they are not inventions, but facts -- even to the

public confession of the accused. I take them from an

old-time Swedish criminal trial, change the actors, 

and transfer the scenes to America. I have added some

details, but only a couple of them are important

ones. -- M. T.]

                                 

WELL, it was the next spring after me and Tom

Sawyer set our old nigger Jim free, the time he

was chained up for a runaway slave down there on

Tom's uncle Silas's farm in Arkansaw. The frost was

working out of the ground, and out of the air, too, and

it was getting closer and closer onto barefoot time every

day; and next it would be marble time, and next

mumbletypeg, and next tops and hoops, and next

kites, and then right away it would be summer and go-

ing in a-swimming. It just makes a boy homesick to

look ahead like that and see how far off summer is.

Yes, and it sets him to sighing and saddening around,

and there's something the matter with him, he don't

know what. But anyway, he gets out by himself and

mopes and thinks; and mostly he hunts for a lone-

some place high up on the hill in the edge of the woods,

and sets there and looks away off on the big Mississippi

down there a-reaching miles and miles around the points

where the timber looks smoky and dim it's so far off and

still, and everything's so solemn it seems like everybody

you've loved is dead and gone, and you 'most wish you

was dead and gone too, and done with it all.



Don't you know what that is? It's spring fever.

That is what the name of it is. And when you've got

it, you want -- oh, you don't quite know what it is you

DO want, but it just fairly makes your heart ache, you

want it so! It seems to you that mainly what you want

is to get away; get away from the same old tedious

things you're so used to seeing and so tired of, and set

something new. That is the idea; you want to go and

be a wanderer; you want to go wandering far away to

strange countries where everything is mysterious and

wonderful and romantic. And if you can't do that,

you'll put up with considerable less; you'll go any-

where you CAN go, just so as to get away, and be thank-

ful of the chance, too.



Well, me and Tom Sawyer had the spring fever, and

had it bad, too; but it warn't any use to think about

Tom trying to get away, because, as he said, his Aunt

Polly wouldn't let him quit school and go traipsing off

somers wasting time; so we was pretty blue. We was

setting on the front steps one day about sundown talk-

ing this way, when out comes his aunt Polly with a

letter in her hand and says:



"Tom, I reckon you've got to pack up and go down

to Arkansaw -- your aunt Sally wants you."



I 'most jumped out of my skin for joy. I reckoned

Tom would fly at his aunt and hug her head off; but if

you believe me he set there like a rock, and never said

a word. It made me fit to cry to see him act so foolish,

with such a noble chance as this opening up. Why,

we might lose it if he didn't speak up and show he was

thankful and grateful. But he set there and studied

and studied till I was that distressed I didn't know

what to do; then he says, very ca'm, and I could a

shot him for it:



"Well," he says, "I'm right down sorry, Aunt

Polly, but I reckon I got to be excused -- for the

present."



His aunt Polly was knocked so stupid and so mad at

the cold impudence of it that she couldn't say a word

for as much as a half a minute, and this gave me a

chance to nudge Tom and whisper:



"Ain't you got any sense? Sp'iling such a noble

chance as this and throwing it away?"



But he warn't disturbed. He mumbled back:



"Huck Finn, do you want me to let her SEE how bad

I want to go? Why, she'd begin to doubt, right

away, and imagine a lot of sicknesses and dangers and

objections, and first you know she'd take it all back.

You lemme alone; I reckon I know how to work her."



Now I never would 'a' thought of that. But he was

right. Tom Sawyer was always right -- the levelest

head I ever see, and always AT himself and ready for

anything you might spring on him. By this time his

aunt Polly was all straight again, and she let fly. She

says:



"You'll be excused! YOU will! Well, I never

heard the like of it in all my days! The idea of you

talking like that to ME! Now take yourself off and

pack your traps; and if I hear another word out of

you about what you'll be excused from and what you

won't, I lay I'LL excuse you -- with a hickory!"



She hit his head a thump with her thimble as we

dodged by, and he let on to be whimpering as we

struck for the stairs. Up in his room he hugged me,

he was so out of his head for gladness because he was

going traveling. And he says:



"Before we get away she'll wish she hadn't let me

go, but she won't know any way to get around it now.

After what she's said, her pride won't let her take it

back."



Tom was packed in ten minutes, all except what his

aunt and Mary would finish up for him; then we waited

ten more for her to get cooled down and sweet and

gentle again; for Tom said it took her ten minutes to

unruffle in times when half of her feathers was up, but

twenty when they was all up, and this was one of the

times when they was all up. Then we went down,

being in a sweat to know what the letter said.



She was setting there in a brown study, with it laying

in her lap. We set down, and she says:



"They're in considerable trouble down there, and

they think you and Huck'll be a kind of diversion for

them -- 'comfort,' they say. Much of that they'll get

out of you and Huck Finn, I reckon. There's a neigh-

bor named Brace Dunlap that's been wanting to marry

their Benny for three months, and at last they told him

point blank and once for all, he COULDN'T; so he has soured

on them, and they're worried about it. I reckon he's

somebody they think they better be on the good side

of, for they've tried to please him by hiring his no-

account brother to help on the farm when they can't

hardly afford it, and don't want him around anyhow.

Who are the Dunlaps?"



"They live about a mile from Uncle Silas's place,

Aunt Polly -- all the farmers live about a mile apart

down there -- and Brace Dunlap is a long sight richer

than any of the others, and owns a whole grist of nig-

gers. He's a widower, thirty-six years old, without

any children, and is proud of his money and overbear-

ing, and everybody is a little afraid of him. I judge he

thought he could have any girl he wanted, just for the

asking, and it must have set him back a good deal when

he found he couldn't get Benny. Why, Benny's only

half as old as he is, and just as sweet and lovely asQ

well, you've seen her. Poor old Uncle Silas -- why,

it's pitiful, him trying to curry favor that way -- so hard

pushed and poor, and yet hiring that useless Jubiter

Dunlap to please his ornery brother."



"What a name -- Jubiter! Where'd he get it?"



"It's only just a nickname. I reckon they've forgot

his real name long before this. He's twenty-seven,

now, and has had it ever since the first time he ever

went in swimming. The school teacher seen a round

brown mole the size of a dime on his left leg above his

knee, and four little bits of moles around it, when he

was naked, and he said it minded him of Jubiter and

his moons; and the children thought it was funny, and

so they got to calling him Jubiter, and he's Jubiter yet.

He's tall, and lazy, and sly, and sneaky, and ruther

cowardly, too, but kind of good-natured, and wears

long brown hair and no beard, and hasn't got a cent,

and Brace boards him for nothing, and gives him his old

clothes to wear, and despises him. Jubiter is a twin."



"What's t'other twin like?"



"Just exactly like Jubiter -- so they say; used to

was, anyway, but he hain't been seen for seven years.

He got to robbing when he was nineteen or twenty,

and they jailed him; but he broke jail and got away --

up North here, somers. They used to hear about him

robbing and burglaring now and then, but that was

years ago. He's dead, now. At least that's what

they say. They don't hear about him any more."



"What was his name?"



"Jake."



There wasn't anything more said for a considerable

while; the old lady was thinking. At last she says:



"The thing that is mostly worrying your aunt Sally

is the tempers that that man Jubiter gets your uncle

into."



Tom was astonished, and so was I. Tom says:



"Tempers? Uncle Silas? Land, you must be jok-

ing! I didn't know he HAD any temper."



"Works him up into perfect rages, your aunt Sally

says; says he acts as if he would really hit the man,

sometimes."



"Aunt Polly, it beats anything I ever heard of.

Why, he's just as gentle as mush."



"Well, she's worried, anyway. Says your uncle

Silas is like a changed man, on account of all this

quarreling. And the neighbors talk about it, and lay

all the blame on your uncle, of course, because he's a

preacher and hain't got any business to quarrel. Your

aunt Sally says he hates to go into the pulpit he's so

ashamed; and the people have begun to cool toward

him, and he ain't as popular now as he used to was."



"Well, ain't it strange? Why, Aunt Polly, he was

always so good and kind and moony and absent-minded

and chuckle-headed and lovable -- why, he was just an

angel! What CAN be the matter of him, do you

reckon?"
