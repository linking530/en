                      Rank and Dignity of Piloting



IN my preceding chapters I have tried, by going into the minutiae

of the science of piloting, to carry the reader step by step

to a comprehension of what the science consists of; and at

the same time I have tried to show him that it is a very curious

and wonderful science, too, and very worthy of his attention.

If I have seemed to love my subject, it is no surprising thing,

for I loved the profession far better than any I have followed since,

and I took a measureless pride in it.  The reason is plain:

a pilot, in those days, was the only unfettered and

entirely independent human being that lived in the earth.

Kings are but the hampered servants of parliament and people;

parliaments sit in chains forged by their constituency;

the editor of a newspaper cannot be independent, but must

work with one hand tied behind him by party and patrons,

and be content to utter only half or two-thirds of his mind;

no clergyman is a free man and may speak the whole truth,

regardless of his parish's opinions; writers of all kinds are

manacled servants of the public.  We write frankly and fearlessly,

but then we 'modify' before we print.  In truth, every man and

woman and child has a master, and worries and frets in servitude;

but in the day I write of, the Mississippi pilot had none.

The captain could stand upon the hurricane deck, in the pomp

of a very brief authority, and give him five or six orders while

the vessel backed into the stream, and then that skipper's reign

was over.  The moment that the boat was under way in the river,

she was under the sole and unquestioned control of the pilot.

He could do with her exactly as he pleased, run her when and whither

he chose, and tie her up to the bank whenever his judgment said

that that course was best.  His movements were entirely free;

he consulted no one, he received commands from nobody,

he promptly resented even the merest suggestions.  Indeed, the law

of the United States forbade him to listen to commands

or suggestions, rightly considering that the pilot necessarily

knew better how to handle the boat than anybody could tell him.

So here was the novelty of a king without a keeper, an absolute monarch

who was absolute in sober truth and not by a fiction of words.

I have seen a boy of eighteen taking a great steamer serenely

into what seemed almost certain destruction, and the aged captain

standing mutely by, filled with apprehension but powerless

to interfere.  His interference, in that particular instance,

might have been an excellent thing, but to permit it would

have been to establish a most pernicious precedent.  It will

easily be guessed, considering the pilot's boundless authority,

that he was a great personage in the old steamboating days.

He was treated with marked courtesy by the captain and with marked

deference by all the officers and servants; and this deferential

spirit was quickly communicated to the passengers, too.  I think

pilots were about the only people I ever knew who failed to show,

in some degree, embarrassment in the presence of traveling

foreign princes.  But then, people in one's own grade of life

are not usually embarrassing objects.



By long habit, pilots came to put all their wishes in the form of commands.

It 'gravels' me, to this day, to put my will in the weak shape of

a request, instead of launching it in the crisp language of an order.

In those old days, to load a steamboat at St. Louis, take her to New

Orleans and back, and discharge cargo, consumed about twenty-five days,

on an average.  Seven or eight of these days the boat spent at the wharves

of St. Louis and New Orleans, and every soul on board was hard at work,

except the two pilots; they did nothing but play gentleman up town,

and receive the same wages for it as if they had been on duty.

The moment the boat touched the wharf at either city, they were ashore;

and they were not likely to be seen again till the last bell was ringing and

everything in readiness for another voyage.



When a captain got hold of a pilot of particularly high reputation,

he took pains to keep him.  When wages were four hundred dollars

a month on the Upper Mississippi, I have known a captain

to keep such a pilot in idleness, under full pay, three months

at a time, while the river was frozen up.  And one must remember

that in those cheap times four hundred dollars was a salary

of almost inconceivable splendor.  Few men on shore got such pay

as that, and when they did they were mightily looked up to.

When pilots from either end of the river wandered into our small

Missouri village, they were sought by the best and the fairest,

and treated with exalted respect.  Lying in port under wages

was a thing which many pilots greatly enjoyed and appreciated;

especially if they belonged in the Missouri River in the heyday

of that trade (Kansas times), and got nine hundred dollars a trip,

which was equivalent to about eighteen hundred dollars a month.

Here is a conversation of that day.  A chap out of the Illinois River,

with a little stern-wheel tub, accosts a couple of ornate and gilded

Missouri River pilots--



'Gentlemen, I've got a pretty good trip for the upcountry,

and shall want you about a month.  How much will it be?'



'Eighteen hundred dollars apiece.'



'Heavens and earth!  You take my boat, let me have your wages,

and I'll divide!'



I will remark, in passing, that Mississippi steamboatmen were

important in landsmen's eyes (and in their own, too, in a degree)

according to the dignity of the boat they were on.

For instance, it was a proud thing to be of the crew of such

stately craft as the 'Aleck Scott' or the 'Grand Turk.'

Negro firemen, deck hands, and barbers belonging to those boats

were distinguished personages in their grade of life, and they were

well aware of that fact too.  A stalwart darkey once gave offense

at a negro ball in New Orleans by putting on a good many airs.

Finally one of the managers bustled up to him and said--



'Who IS you, any way?  Who is you? dat's what I



wants to know!'



The offender was not disconcerted in the least, but swelled himself up

and threw that into his voice which showed that he knew he was not putting

on all those airs on a stinted capital.



'Who IS I?  Who IS I?  I let you know mighty quick who I is!

I want you niggers to understan' dat I fires de middle do'<footnote

[Door]> on de "Aleck Scott! " '



That was sufficient.



The barber of the 'Grand Turk' was a spruce young negro,

who aired his importance with balmy complacency,

and was greatly courted by the circle in which he moved.

The young colored population of New Orleans were much given

to flirting, at twilight, on the banquettes of the back streets.

Somebody saw and heard something like the following,

one evening, in one of those localities.  A middle-aged negro

woman projected her head through a broken pane and shouted

(very willing that the neighbors should hear and envy), 'You

Mary Ann, come in de house dis minute!  Stannin' out dah foolin'

'long wid dat low trash, an' heah's de barber offn de "Gran' Turk"

wants to conwerse wid you! '



My reference, a moment ago, to the fact that a pilot's peculiar

official position placed him out of the reach of criticism or command,

brings Stephen W---- naturally to my mind.  He was a gifted pilot,

a good fellow, a tireless talker, and had both wit and humor in him.

He had a most irreverent independence, too, and was deliciously

easy-going and comfortable in the presence of age, official dignity,

and even the most august wealth.  He always had work, he never

saved a penny, he was a most persuasive borrower, he was in debt

to every pilot on the river, and to the majority of the captains.

He could throw a sort of splendor around a bit of harum-scarum,

devil-may-care piloting, that made it almost fascinating--

but not to everybody.  He made a trip with good old Captain Y----

once, and was 'relieved' from duty when the boat got to New Orleans.

Somebody expressed surprise at the discharge.  Captain Y----

shuddered at the mere mention of Stephen.  Then his poor, thin old

voice piped out something like this:--



'Why, bless me!  I wouldn't have such a wild creature on my boat

for the world--not for the whole world!  He swears, he sings,

he whistles, he yells--I never saw such an Injun to yell.

All times of the night--it never made any difference to him.

He would just yell that way, not for anything in particular,

but merely on account of a kind of devilish comfort he got out of it.

I never could get into a sound sleep but he would fetch me

out of bed, all in a cold sweat, with one of those dreadful

war-whoops. A queer being--very queer being; no respect

for anything or anybody.  Sometimes he called me "Johnny."

And he kept a fiddle, and a cat.  He played execrably.

This seemed to distress the cat, and so the cat would howl.

Nobody could sleep where that man--and his family--was.

And reckless.  There never was anything like it.

Now you may believe it or not, but as sure as I am sitting here,

he brought my boat a-tilting down through those awful snags

at Chicot under a rattling head of steam, and the wind a-blowing

like the very nation, at that!  My officers will tell you so.

They saw it.  And, sir, while he was a-tearing right down

through those snags, and I a-shaking in my shoes and praying,

I wish I may never speak again if he didn't pucker up his mouth

and go to WHISTLING!  Yes, sir; whistling "Buffalo gals,

can't you come out tonight, can't you come out to-night,

can't you come out to-night;" and doing it as calmly as if we

were attending a funeral and weren't related to the corpse.

And when I remonstrated with him about it, he smiled down on me

as if I was his child, and told me to run in the house and try

to be good, and not be meddling with my superiors!"



Once a pretty mean captain caught Stephen in New Orleans out of work

and as usual out of money.  He laid steady siege to Stephen, who was

in a very 'close place,' and finally persuaded him to hire with him

at one hundred and twenty-five dollars per month, just half wages,

the captain agreeing not to divulge the secret and so bring down the contempt

of all the guild upon the poor fellow.  But the boat was not more than

a day out of New Orleans before Stephen discovered that the captain

was boasting of his exploit, and that all the officers had been told.

Stephen winced, but said nothing.  About the middle of the afternoon

the captain stepped out on the hurricane deck, cast his eye around,

and looked a good deal surprised.  He glanced inquiringly aloft at Stephen,

but Stephen was whistling placidly, and attending to business.

The captain stood around a while in evident discomfort, and once or twice

seemed about to make a suggestion; but the etiquette of the river taught

him to avoid that sort of rashness, and so he managed to hold his peace.

He chafed and puzzled a few minutes longer, then retired to his apartments.

But soon he was out again, and apparently more perplexed than ever.

Presently he ventured to remark, with deference--



'Pretty good stage of the river now, ain't it, sir?'



'Well, I should say so!  Bank-full IS a pretty liberal stage.'



'Seems to be a good deal of current here.'



'Good deal don't describe it!  It's worse than a mill-race.'



'Isn't it easier in toward shore than it is out here in the middle?'



'Yes, I reckon it is; but a body can't be too careful with a steamboat.

It's pretty safe out here; can't strike any bottom here, you can

depend on that.'



The captain departed, looking rueful enough.  At this rate,

he would probably die of old age before his boat got to St. Louis.

Next day he appeared on deck and again found Stephen faithfully

standing up the middle of the river, fighting the whole vast

force of the Mississippi, and whistling the same placid tune.

This thing was becoming serious.  In by the shore was a slower boat

clipping along in the easy water and gaining steadily; she began

to make for an island chute; Stephen stuck to the middle of the river.

Speech was WRUNG from the captain.  He said--



'Mr. W----, don't that chute cut off a good deal of distance?'



'I think it does, but I don't know.'



'Don't know!  Well, isn't there water enough in it now to go through?'



'I expect there is, but I am not certain.'



'Upon my word this is odd!  Why, those pilots on that boat yonder are going

to try it.  Do you mean to say that you don't know as much as they do?'



'THEY!  Why, THEY are two-hundred-and-fifty-dollar pilots!

But don't you be uneasy; I know as much as any man can afford

to know for a hundred and twenty-five!'



The captain surrendered.



Five minutes later Stephen was bowling through the chute and showing

the rival boat a two-hundred-and-fifty-dollar pair of heels.
