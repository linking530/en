                        A Section in My Biography



IN due course I got my license.  I was a pilot now, full fledged.

I dropped into casual employments; no misfortunes resulting,

intermittent work gave place to steady and protracted engagements.

Time drifted smoothly and prosperously on, and I supposed--and hoped--

that I was going to follow the river the rest of my days, and die

at the wheel when my mission was ended.  But by and by the war came,

commerce was suspended, my occupation was gone.



I had to seek another livelihood.  So I became a silver miner

in Nevada; next, a newspaper reporter; next, a gold miner,

in California; next, a reporter in San Francisco; next, a special

correspondent in the Sandwich Islands; next, a roving correspondent

in Europe and the East; next, an instructional torch-bearer on

the lecture platform; and, finally, I became a scribbler of books,

and an immovable fixture among the other rocks of New England.



In so few words have I disposed of the twenty-one slow-drifting

years that have come and gone since I last looked from the windows

of a pilot-house.



Let us resume, now.
