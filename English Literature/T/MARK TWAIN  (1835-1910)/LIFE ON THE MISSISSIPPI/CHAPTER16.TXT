                               Racing Days



IT was always the custom for the boats to leave New

Orleans between four and five o'clock in the afternoon.

From three o'clock onward they would be burning rosin and pitch pine

(the sign of preparation), and so one had the picturesque spectacle

of a rank, some two or three miles long, of tall, ascending columns

of coal-black smoke; a colonnade which supported a sable roof of

the same smoke blended together and spreading abroad over the city.

Every outward-bound boat had its flag flying at the jack-staff,

and sometimes a duplicate on the verge staff astern.

Two or three miles of mates were commanding and swearing with more

than usual emphasis; countless processions of freight barrels

and boxes were spinning athwart the levee and flying aboard

the stage-planks, belated passengers were dodging and skipping

among these frantic things, hoping to reach the forecastle

companion way alive, but having their doubts about it;

women with reticules and bandboxes were trying to keep up

with husbands freighted with carpet-sacks and crying babies,

and making a failure of it by losing their heads in the whirl

and roar and general distraction; drays and baggage-vans were

clattering hither and thither in a wild hurry, every now and

then getting blocked and jammed together, and then during ten

seconds one could not see them for the profanity, except vaguely

and dimly; every windlass connected with every forehatch,

from one end of that long array of steamboats to the other,

was keeping up a deafening whiz and whir, lowering freight

into the hold, and the half-naked crews of perspiring negroes

that worked them were roaring such songs as 'De Las' Sack!

De Las' Sack!'--inspired to unimaginable exaltation by the chaos

of turmoil and racket that was driving everybody else mad.

By this time the hurricane and boiler decks of the steamers

would be packed and black with passengers.  The 'last bells'

would begin to clang, all down the line, and then the powwow

seemed to double; in a moment or two the final warning came,--

a simultaneous din of Chinese gongs, with the cry,

'All dat ain't goin', please to git asho'! '--and behold,

the powwow quadrupled!  People came swarming ashore,

overturning excited stragglers that were trying to swarm aboard.

One more moment later a long array of stage-planks was being

hauled in, each with its customary latest passenger clinging

to the end of it with teeth, nails, and everything else,

and the customary latest procrastinator making a wild spring

shoreward over his head.



Now a number of the boats slide backward into the stream,

leaving wide gaps in the serried rank of steamers.

Citizens crowd the decks of boats that are not to go, in order

to see the sight.  Steamer after steamer straightens herself up,

gathers all her strength, and presently comes swinging by,

under a tremendous head of steam, with flag flying,

black smoke rolling, and her entire crew of firemen and deck-hands

(usually swarthy negroes) massed together on the forecastle,

the best 'voice' in the lot towering from the midst

(being mounted on the capstan), waving his hat or a flag,

and all roaring a mighty chorus, while the parting cannons boom

and the multitudinous spectators swing their hats and huzza!

Steamer after steamer falls into line, and the stately procession goes

winging its flight up the river.



In the old times, whenever two fast boats started out on a race,

with a big crowd of people looking on, it was inspiring to hear

the crews sing, especially if the time were night-fall, and the forecastle

lit up with the red glare of the torch-baskets. Racing was royal fun.

The public always had an idea that racing was dangerous; whereas the opposite

was the case--that is, after the laws were passed which restricted

each boat to just so many pounds of steam to the square inch.

No engineer was ever sleepy or careless when his heart was in a race.

He was constantly on the alert, trying gauge-cocks and watching things.

The dangerous place was on slow, plodding boats, where the engineers drowsed

around and allowed chips to get into the 'doctor' and shut off the water

supply from the boilers.



In the 'flush times' of steamboating, a race between two notoriously

fleet steamers was an event of vast importance.  The date was set

for it several weeks in advance, and from that time forward, the whole

Mississippi Valley was in a state of consuming excitement.  Politics and

the weather were dropped, and people talked only of the coming race.

As the time approached, the two steamers 'stripped' and got ready.

Every encumbrance that added weight, or exposed a resisting surface

to wind or water, was removed, if the boat could possibly do without it.

The 'spars,' and sometimes even their supporting derricks, were sent ashore,

and no means left to set the boat afloat in case she got aground.

When the 'Eclipse' and the 'A. L. Shotwell' ran their great race many

years ago, it was said that pains were taken to scrape the gilding off

the fanciful device which hung between the 'Eclipse's' chimneys, and that for

that one trip the captain left off his kid gloves and had his head shaved.

But I always doubted these things.



If the boat was known to make her best speed when drawing five and a half feet

forward and five feet aft, she was carefully loaded to that exact figure--

she wouldn't enter a dose of homoeopathic pills on her manifest after that.

Hardly any passengers were taken, because they not only add weight but they

never will 'trim boat.'  They always run to the side when there is anything

to see, whereas a conscientious and experienced steamboatman would stick to

the center of the boat and part his hair in the middle with a spirit level.



No way-freights and no way-passengers were allowed, for the racers would

stop only at the largest towns, and then it would be only 'touch and go.'

Coal flats and wood flats were contracted for beforehand, and these were

kept ready to hitch on to the flying steamers at a moment's warning.

Double crews were carried, so that all work could be quickly done.



The chosen date being come, and all things in readiness,

the two great steamers back into the stream, and lie there

jockeying a moment, and apparently watching each other's

slightest movement, like sentient creatures; flags drooping,

the pent steam shrieking through safety-valves, the black smoke

rolling and tumbling from the chimneys and darkening all the air.

People, people everywhere; the shores, the house-tops,

the steamboats, the ships, are packed with them, and you know

that the borders of the broad Mississippi are going to be

fringed with humanity thence northward twelve hundred miles,

to welcome these racers.



Presently tall columns of steam burst from the 'scape-pipes

of both steamers, two guns boom a good-bye, two red-shirted heroes

mounted on capstans wave their small flags above the massed crews

on the forecastles, two plaintive solos linger on the air a few

waiting seconds, two mighty choruses burst forth--and here they come!

Brass bands bray Hail Columbia, huzza after huzza thunders from

the shores, and the stately creatures go whistling by like the wind.



Those boats will never halt a moment between New Orleans and St. Louis,

except for a second or two at large towns, or to hitch thirty-cord

wood-boats alongside.  You should be on board when they take a couple

of those wood-boats in tow and turn a swarm of men into each;

by the time you have wiped your glasses and put them on, you will be

wondering what has become of that wood.



Two nicely matched steamers will stay in sight of each other day after day.

They might even stay side by side, but for the fact that pilots are not

all alike, and the smartest pilots will win the race.  If one of the boats has

a 'lightning' pilot, whose 'partner' is a trifle his inferior, you can tell

which one is on watch by noting whether that boat has gained ground or lost

some during each four-hour stretch.  The shrewdest pilot can delay a boat

if he has not a fine genius for steering.  Steering is a very high art.

One must not keep a rudder dragging across a boat's stem if he wants to get up

the river fast.



There is a great difference in boats, of course.  For a long time I was on

a boat that was so slow we used to forget what year it was we left port in.

But of course this was at rare intervals.  Ferryboats used to lose

valuable trips because their passengers grew old and died, waiting for us

to get by.  This was at still rarer intervals.  I had the documents

for these occurrences, but through carelessness they have been mislaid.

This boat, the 'John J. Roe,' was so slow that when she finally sunk

in Madrid Bend, it was five years before the owners heard of it.

That was always a confusing fact to me, but it is according to the record,

any way.  She was dismally slow; still, we often had pretty

exciting times racing with islands, and rafts, and such things.

One trip, however, we did rather well.  We went to St. Louis in sixteen days.

But even at this rattling gait I think we changed watches three times

in Fort Adams reach, which is five miles long.  A 'reach' is a piece

of straight river, and of course the current drives through such a place

in a pretty lively way.



That trip we went to Grand Gulf, from New Orleans, in four days

(three hundred and forty miles); the 'Eclipse' and 'Shotwell'

did it in one.  We were nine days out, in the chute of 63

(seven hundred miles); the 'Eclipse' and 'Shotwell' went

there in two days.  Something over a generation ago,

a boat called the 'J. M. White' went from New Orleans

to Cairo in three days, six hours, and forty-four minutes.

In 1853 the 'Eclipse' made the same trip in three days,

three hours, and twenty minutes.<footnote [Time disputed.

Some authorities add 1 hour and 16 minutes to this.]> In

1870 the 'R. E. Lee' did it in three days and ONE hour.

This last is called the fastest trip on record.

I will try to show that it was not.  For this reason:

the distance between New Orleans and Cairo, when the 'J. M. White'

ran it, was about eleven hundred and six miles; consequently her

average speed was a trifle over fourteen miles per hour.

In the 'Eclipse's' day the distance between the two ports had become

reduced to one thousand and eighty miles; consequently her average

speed was a shade under fourteen and three-eighths miles per hour.

In the 'R. E. Lee's' time the distance had diminished

to about one thousand and thirty miles; consequently her

average was about fourteen and one-eighth miles per hour.

Therefore the 'Eclipse's' was conspicuously the fastest time that has

ever been made.

The Lee landed at St. Louis at 11.25 A.M., on July 4th, 1870--6 hours

and 36 minutes ahead of the Natchez.  The officers of the Natchez claimed

7 hours and 1 minute stoppage on account of fog and repairing machinery.

The R. E. Lee was commanded by Captain John W. Cannon, and the Natchez was in

charge of that veteran Southern boatman, Captain Thomas P. Leathers.
