                         Continued Perplexities



THERE was no use in arguing with a person like this.  I promptly

put such a strain on my memory that by and by even the shoal

water and the countless crossing-marks began to stay with me.

But the result was just the same.  I never could more than get

one knotty thing learned before another presented itself.

Now I had often seen pilots gazing at the water and pretending to read

it as if it were a book; but it was a book that told me nothing.

A time came at last, however, when Mr. Bixby seemed to think me far

enough advanced to bear a lesson on water-reading. So he began--



'Do you see that long slanting line on the face of the water Now,

that's a reef.  Moreover, it's a bluff reef.  There is a solid sand-bar

under it that is nearly as straight up and down as the side of a house.

There is plenty of water close up to it, but mighty little on top of it.

If you were to hit it you would knock the boat's brains out.

Do you see where the line fringes out at the upper end and begins to

fade away '



'Yes, sir.'



'Well, that is a low place; that is the head of the reef.

You can climb over there, and not hurt anything.  Cross over,

now, and follow along close under the reef--easy water there--

not much current.'



I followed the reef along till I approached the fringed end.

Then Mr. Bixby said--



'Now get ready.  Wait till I give the word.  She won't want to mount the reef;

a boat hates shoal water.  Stand by--wait--WAIT--keep her well in hand.

NOW cramp her down!  Snatch her! snatch her!'



He seized the other side of the wheel and helped to spin

it around until it was hard down, and then we held it so.

The boat resisted, and refused to answer for a while, and next she

came surging to starboard, mounted the reef, and sent a long,

angry ridge of water foaming away from her bows.



'Now watch her; watch her like a cat, or she'll get away from you.

When she fights strong and the tiller slips a little,

in a jerky, greasy sort of way, let up on her a trifle;

it is the way she tells you at night that the water is too shoal;

but keep edging her up, little by little, toward the point.

You are well up on the bar, now; there is a bar under every point,

because the water that comes down around it forms an eddy

and allows the sediment to sink.  Do you see those fine lines

on the face of the water that branch out like the ribs of a fan.

Well, those are little reefs; you want to just miss the ends

of them, but run them pretty close.  Now look out--look out!

Don't you crowd that slick, greasy-looking place; there ain't

nine feet there; she won't stand it.  She begins to smell it;

look sharp, I tell you!  Oh blazes, there you go!

Stop the starboard wheel!  Quick!  Ship up to back!

Set her back!



The engine bells jingled and the engines answered promptly,

shooting white columns of steam far aloft out of the 'scape pipes,

but it was too late.  The boat had 'smelt' the bar in good earnest;

the foamy ridges that radiated from her bows suddenly disappeared,

a great dead swell came rolling forward and swept ahead of her,

she careened far over to larboard, and went tearing away

toward the other shore as if she were about scared to death.

We were a good mile from where we ought to have been, when we

finally got the upper hand of her again.



During the afternoon watch the next day, Mr. Bixby asked me if I

knew how to run the next few miles.  I said--



'Go inside the first snag above the point, outside the next one,

start out from the lower end of Higgins's wood-yard, make

a square crossing and----'



'That's all right.  I'll be back before you close up on the next point.'



But he wasn't. He was still below when I rounded it and entered upon

a piece of river which I had some misgivings about.  I did not know

that he was hiding behind a chimney to see how I would perform.

I went gaily along, getting prouder and prouder, for he had never

left the boat in my sole charge such a length of time before.

I even got to 'setting' her and letting the wheel go, entirely, while I

vaingloriously turned my back and inspected the stem marks and hummed a tune,

a sort of easy indifference which I had prodigiously admired in Bixby

and other great pilots.  Once I inspected rather long, and when I faced

to the front again my heart flew into my mouth so suddenly that if I hadn't

clapped my teeth together I should have lost it.  One of those frightful

bluff reefs was stretching its deadly length right across our bows!

My head was gone in a moment; I did not know which end I stood on;

I gasped and could not get my breath; I spun the wheel down with such

rapidity that it wove itself together like a spider's web; the boat

answered and turned square away from the reef, but the reef followed her!

I fled, and still it followed, still it kept--right across my bows!

I never looked to see where I was going, I only fled.

The awful crash was imminent--why didn't that villain come!

If I committed the crime of ringing a bell, I might get thrown overboard.

But better that than kill the boat.  So in blind desperation I started

such a rattling 'shivaree' down below as never had astounded an engineer

in this world before, I fancy.  Amidst the frenzy of the bells the engines

began to back and fill in a furious way, and my reason forsook its throne--

we were about to crash into the woods on the other side of the river.

Just then Mr. Bixby stepped calmly into view on the hurricane deck.

My soul went out to him in gratitude.  My distress vanished; I would have

felt safe on the brink of Niagara, with Mr. Bixby on the hurricane deck.

He blandly and sweetly took his tooth-pick out of his mouth between

his fingers, as if it were a cigar--we were just in the act of climbing

an overhanging big tree, and the passengers were scudding astern like rats--

and lifted up these commands to me ever so gently--



'Stop the starboard.  Stop the larboard.  Set her back on both.'



The boat hesitated, halted, pressed her nose among the boughs

a critical instant, then reluctantly began to back away.



'Stop the larboard.  Come ahead on it.  Stop the starboard.

Come ahead on it.  Point her for the bar.'



I sailed away as serenely as a summer's morning Mr. Bixby came in and said,

with mock simplicity--



'When you have a hail, my boy, you ought to tap the big bell three times

before you land, so that the engineers can get ready.'



I blushed under the sarcasm, and said I hadn't had any hail.



'Ah!  Then it was for wood, I suppose.  The officer of the watch

will tell you when he wants to wood up.'



I went on consuming and said I wasn't after wood.



'Indeed?  Why, what could you want over here in the bend, then?

Did you ever know of a boat following a bend up-stream at this

stage of the river?'



'No sir,--and I wasn't trying to follow it.  I was getting away

from a bluff reef.'



'No, it wasn't a bluff reef; there isn't one within three miles

of where you were.'



'But I saw it.  It was as bluff as that one yonder.'



'Just about.  Run over it!'



'Do you give it as an order?'



'Yes.  Run over it.'



'If I don't, I wish I may die.'



'All right; I am taking the responsibility.'  I was just as

anxious to kill the boat, now, as I had been to save her before.

I impressed my orders upon my memory, to be used at the inquest,

and made a straight break for the reef.  As it disappeared under

our bows I held my breath; but we slid over it like oil.



'Now don't you see the difference?  It wasn't anything but a WIND reef.

The wind does that.'



'So I see.  But it is exactly like a bluff reef.

How am I ever going to tell them apart?'



'I can't tell you.  It is an instinct.  By and by you will just naturally

KNOW one from the other, but you never will be able to explain why or how you

know them apart'



It turned out to be true.  The face of the water, in time,

became a wonderful book--a book that was a dead language to the

uneducated passenger, but which told its mind to me without reserve,

delivering its most cherished secrets as clearly as if it uttered

them with a voice.  And it was not a book to be read once

and thrown aside, for it had a new story to tell every day.

Throughout the long twelve hundred miles there was never a page

that was void of interest, never one that you could leave

unread without loss, never one that you would want to skip,

thinking you could find higher enjoyment in some other thing.

There never was so wonderful a book written by man; never one

whose interest was so absorbing, so unflagging, so sparkingly

renewed with every re-perusal. The passenger who could not read it

was charmed with a peculiar sort of faint dimple on its surface

(on the rare occasions when he did not overlook it altogether);

but to the pilot that was an ITALICIZED passage; indeed, it was

more than that, it was a legend of the largest capitals,

with a string of shouting exclamation points at the end of it;

for it meant that a wreck or a rock was buried there that could

tear the life out of the strongest vessel that ever floated.

It is the faintest and simplest expression the water ever makes,

and the most hideous to a pilot's eye.  In truth, the passenger

who could not read this book saw nothing but all manner of pretty

pictures in it painted by the sun and shaded by the clouds,

whereas to the trained eye these were not pictures at all,

but the grimmest and most dead-earnest of reading-matter.



Now when I had mastered the language of this water and had come to know

every trifling feature that bordered the great river as familiarly as I

knew the letters of the alphabet, I had made a valuable acquisition.

But I had lost something, too.  I had lost something which could never

be restored to me while I lived.  All the grace, the beauty, the poetry

had gone out of the majestic river!  I still keep in mind a certain

wonderful sunset which I witnessed when steamboating was new to me.

A broad expanse of the river was turned to blood; in the middle distance

the red hue brightened into gold, through which a solitary log came floating,

black and conspicuous; in one place a long, slanting mark lay sparkling upon

the water; in another the surface was broken by boiling, tumbling rings,

that were as many-tinted as an opal; where the ruddy flush was faintest,

was a smooth spot that was covered with graceful circles and radiating lines,

ever so delicately traced; the shore on our left was densely wooded,

and the somber shadow that fell from this forest was broken in one place

by a long, ruffled trail that shone like silver; and high above the forest

wall a clean-stemmed dead tree waved a single leafy bough that glowed

like a flame in the unobstructed splendor that was flowing from the sun.

There were graceful curves, reflected images, woody heights, soft distances;

and over the whole scene, far and near, the dissolving lights drifted

steadily, enriching it, every passing moment, with new marvels of coloring.



I stood like one bewitched.  I drank it in, in a speechless rapture.

The world was new to me, and I had never seen anything like this at home.

But as I have said, a day came when I began to cease from noting the glories

and the charms which the moon and the sun and the twilight wrought upon

the river's face; another day came when I ceased altogether to note them.

Then, if that sunset scene had been repeated, I should have looked upon

it without rapture, and should have commented upon it, inwardly, after

this fashion:  This sun means that we are going to have wind to-morrow;

that floating log means that the river is rising, small thanks to it;

that slanting mark on the water refers to a bluff reef which is going

to kill somebody's steamboat one of these nights, if it keeps on stretching

out like that; those tumbling 'boils' show a dissolving bar and a changing

channel there; the lines and circles in the slick water over yonder

are a warning that that troublesome place is shoaling up dangerously;

that silver streak in the shadow of the forest is the 'break' from a new snag,

and he has located himself in the very best place he could have found

to fish for steamboats; that tall dead tree, with a single living branch,

is not going to last long, and then how is a body ever going to get through

this blind place at night without the friendly old landmark.



No, the romance and the beauty were all gone from the river.

All the value any feature of it had for me now was the amount

of usefulness it could furnish toward compassing the safe piloting

of a steamboat.  Since those days, I have pitied doctors from my heart.

What does the lovely flush in a beauty's cheek mean to a doctor

but a 'break' that ripples above some deadly disease.

Are not all her visible charms sown thick with what are to him

the signs and symbols of hidden decay?  Does he ever see her

beauty at all, or doesn't he simply view her professionally,

and comment upon her unwholesome condition all to himself?

And doesn't he sometimes wonder whether he has gained most or lost

most by learning his trade?
