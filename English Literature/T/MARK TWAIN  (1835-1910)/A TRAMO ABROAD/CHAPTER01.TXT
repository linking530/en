CHAPTER I

[The Knighted Knave of Bergen]



One day it occurred to me that it had been many years

since the world had been afforded the spectacle of a man

adventurous enough to undertake a journey through Europe

on foot.  After much thought, I decided that I was

a person fitted to furnish to mankind this spectacle. 

So I determined to do it.  This was in March, 1878. 



I looked about me for the right sort of person to

accompany me in the capacity of agent, and finally

hired a Mr. Harris for this service. 



It was also my purpose to study art while in Europe. 

Mr. Harris was in sympathy with me in this.  He was as much

of an enthusiast in art as I was, and not less anxious

to learn to paint.  I desired to learn the German language;

so did Harris. 



Toward the middle of April we sailed in the HOLSATIA,

Captain Brandt, and had a very peasant trip, indeed. 



After a brief rest at Hamburg, we made preparations for

a long pedestrian trip southward in the soft spring weather,

but at the last moment we changed the program,

for private reasons, and took the express-train.



We made a short halt at Frankfort-on-the-Main, and found

it an interesting city.  I would have liked to visit

the birthplace of Gutenburg, but it could not be done,

as no memorandum of the site of the house has been kept. 

So we spent an hour in the Goethe mansion instead. 

The city permits this house to belong to private parties,

instead of gracing and dignifying herself with the honor

of possessing and protecting it. 



Frankfort is one of the sixteen cities which have

the distinction of being the place where the following

incident occurred.  Charlemagne, while chasing the Saxons

(as HE said), or being chased by them (as THEY said),

arrived at the bank of the river at dawn, in a fog. 

The enemy were either before him or behind him;

but in any case he wanted to get across, very badly. 

He would have given anything for a guide, but none was to

be had.  Presently he saw a deer, followed by her young,

approach the water.  He watched her, judging that she

would seek a ford, and he was right.  She waded over,

and the army followed.  So a great Frankish victory or

defeat was gained or avoided; and in order to commemorate

the episode, Charlemagne commanded a city to be built there,

which he named Frankfort--the ford of the Franks. 

None of the other cities where this event happened were

named for it.  This is good evidence that Frankfort was

the first place it occurred at. 



Frankfort has another distinction--it is the birthplace

of the German alphabet; or at least of the German word

for alphabet --BUCHSTABEN. They say that the first movable

types were made on birch sticks--BUCHSTABE--hence the name. 



I was taught a lesson in political economy in Frankfort. 

I had brought from home a box containing a thousand

very cheap cigars.  By way of experiment, I stepped

into a little shop in a queer old back street, took four

gaily decorated boxes of wax matches and three cigars,

and laid down a silver piece worth 48 cents.  The man gave

me 43 cents change. 



In Frankfort everybody wears clean clothes, and I think we

noticed that this strange thing was the case in Hamburg, too,

and in the villages along the road.  Even in the narrowest

and poorest and most ancient quarters of Frankfort neat

and clean clothes were the rule.  The little children

of both sexes were nearly always nice enough to take into

a body's lap.  And as for the uniforms of the soldiers,

they were newness and brightness carried to perfection. 

One could never detect a smirch or a grain of dust

upon them.  The street-car conductors and drivers wore

pretty uniforms which seemed to be just out of the bandbox,

and their manners were as fine as their clothes. 



In one of the shops I had the luck to stumble upon a book

which has charmed me nearly to death.  It is entitled

THE LEGENDS OF THE RHINE FROM BASLE TO ROTTERDAM,

by F. J. Kiefer; translated by L. W. Garnham, B.A.



All tourists MENTION the Rhine legends--in that sort of way

which quietly pretends that the mentioner has been familiar

with them all his life, and that the reader cannot possibly

be ignorant of them--but no tourist ever TELLS them. 

So this little book fed me in a very hungry place; and I,

in my turn, intend to feed my reader, with one or two

little lunches from the same larder.  I shall not mar

Garnharn's translation by meddling with its English;

for the most toothsome thing about it is its quaint

fashion of building English sentences on the German plan--

and punctuating them accordingly to no plan at all. 



In the chapter devoted to "Legends of Frankfort,"

I find the following:



"THE KNAVE OF BERGEN"



"In Frankfort at the Romer was a great mask-ball, at

the coronation festival, and in the illuminated saloon,

the clanging music invited to dance, and splendidly

appeared the rich toilets and charms of the ladies,

and the festively costumed Princes and Knights. 

All seemed pleasure, joy, and roguish gaiety, only one of the

numerous guests had a gloomy exterior; but exactly the black

armor in which he walked about excited general attention,

and his tall figure, as well as the noble propriety of

his movements, attracted especially the regards of the ladies. 

Who the Knight was? Nobody could guess, for his Vizier

was well closed, and nothing made him recognizable. 

Proud and yet modest he advanced to the Empress; bowed on

one knee before her seat, and begged for the favor of a

waltz with the Queen of the festival.  And she allowed

his request.  With light and graceful steps he danced

through the long saloon, with the sovereign who thought

never to have found a more dexterous and excellent dancer. 

But also by the grace of his manner, and fine conversation

he knew to win the Queen, and she graciously accorded him

a second dance for which he begged, a third, and a fourth,

as well as others were not refused him.  How all regarded

the happy dancer, how many envied him the high favor;

how increased curiosity, who the masked knight could be. 



"Also the Emperor became more and more excited with curiosity,

and with great suspense one awaited the hour, when according

to mask-law, each masked guest must make himself known. 

This moment came, but although all other unmasked;

the secret knight still refused to allow his features

to be seen, till at last the Queen driven by curiosity,

and vexed at the obstinate refusal; commanded him to open

his Vizier.  He opened it, and none of the high ladies

and knights knew him.  But from the crowded spectators,

2 officials advanced, who recognized the black dancer,

and horror and terror spread in the saloon, as they said who

the supposed knight was.  It was the executioner of Bergen. 

But glowing with rage, the King commanded to seize the

criminal and lead him to death, who had ventured to dance,

with the queen; so disgraced the Empress, and insulted

the crown.  The culpable threw himself at the Emperor,

and said--



"'Indeed I have heavily sinned against all noble guests

assembled here, but most heavily against you my sovereign

and my queen.  The Queen is insulted by my haughtiness

equal to treason, but no punishment even blood, will not

be able to wash out the disgrace, which you have suffered

by me.  Therefore oh King! allow me to propose a remedy,

to efface the shame, and to render it as if not done. 

Draw your sword and knight me, then I will throw down

my gauntlet, to everyone who dares to speak disrespectfully

of my king.'



"The Emperor was surprised at this bold proposal,

however it appeared the wisest to him; 'You are a knave

he replied after a moment's consideration, however your

advice is good, and displays prudence, as your offense

shows adventurous courage.  Well then, and gave him the

knight-stroke so I raise you to nobility, who begged for

grace for your offense now kneels before me, rise as knight;

knavish you have acted, and Knave of Bergen shall you

be called henceforth, and gladly the Black knight rose;

three cheers were given in honor of the Emperor,

and loud cries of joy testified the approbation with

which the Queen danced still once with the Knave of Bergen."
