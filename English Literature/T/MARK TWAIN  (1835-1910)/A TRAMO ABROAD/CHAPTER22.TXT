[The Black Forest and Its Treasures]



From Baden-Baden we made the customary trip into the

Black Forest.  We were on foot most of the time.  One cannot

describe those noble woods, nor the feeling with which they

inspire him.  A feature of the feeling, however, is a deep

sense of contentment; another feature of it is a buoyant,

boyish gladness; and a third and very conspicuous feature

of it is one's sense of the remoteness of the work-day

world and his entire emancipation from it and its affairs. 



Those woods stretch unbroken over a vast region;

and everywhere they are such dense woods, and so still,

and so piney and fragrant.  The stems of the trees are trim

and straight, and in many places all the ground is hidden

for miles under a thick cushion of moss of a vivid green color,

with not a decayed or ragged spot in its surface, and not

a fallen leaf or twig to mar its immaculate tidiness. 

A rich cathedral gloom pervades the pillared aisles;

so the stray flecks of sunlight that strike a trunk

here and a bough yonder are strongly accented,

and when they strike the moss they fairly seem to burn. 

But the weirdest effect, and the most enchanting is that

produced by the diffused light of the low afternoon sun;

no single ray is able to pierce its way in, then, but the

diffused light takes color from moss and foliage,

and pervades the place like a faint, greet-tinted mist,

the theatrical fire of fairyland.  The suggestion of mystery

and the supernatural which haunts the forest at all times

is intensified by this unearthly glow. 



We found the Black Forest farmhouses and villages

all that the Black Forest stories have pictured them. 

The first genuine specimen which we came upon was

the mansion of a rich farmer and member of the Common

Council of the parish or district.  He was an important

personage in the land and so was his wife also,

of course.  His daughter was the "catch" of the region,

and she may be already entering into immortality as the

heroine of one of Auerbach's novels, for all I know. 

We shall see, for if he puts her in I shall recognize her

by her Black Forest clothes, and her burned complexion,

her plump figure, her fat hands, her dull expression,

her gentle spirit, her generous feet, her bonnetless head,

and the plaited tails of hemp-colored hair hanging down

her back. 



The house was big enough for a hotel; it was a hundred

feet long and fifty wide, and ten feet high, from ground

to eaves; but from the eaves to the comb of the mighty roof

was as much as forty feet, or maybe even more.  This roof

was of ancient mud-colored straw thatch a foot thick,

and was covered all over, except in a few trifling spots,

with a thriving and luxurious growth of green vegetation,

mainly moss.  The mossless spots were places where

repairs had been made by the insertion of bright new

masses of yellow straw.  The eaves projected far down,

like sheltering, hospitable wings.  Across the gable that

fronted the road, and about ten feet above the ground,

ran a narrow porch, with a wooden railing; a row of

small windows filled with very small panes looked upon

the porch.  Above were two or three other little windows,

one clear up under the sharp apex of the roof. 

Before the ground-floor door was a huge pile of manure. 

The door of the second-story room on the side of the house

was open, and occupied by the rear elevation of a cow. 

Was this probably the drawing-room? All of the front

half of the house from the ground up seemed to be

occupied by the people, the cows, and the chickens,

and all the rear half by draught-animals and hay. 

But the chief feature, all around this house, was the big

heaps of manure. 



We became very familiar with the fertilizer in the Forest. 

We fell unconsciously into the habit of judging of a man's

station in life by this outward and eloquent sign. 

Sometimes we said, "Here is a poor devil, this is manifest."

When we saw a stately accumulation, we said, "Here is

a banker." When we encountered a country-seat surrounded

by an Alpine pomp of manure, we said, "Doubtless a duke

lives here."



The importance of this feature has not been properly

magnified in the Black Forest stories.  Manure is evidently

the Black-Forester's main treasure--his coin, his jewel,

his pride, his Old Master, his ceramics, his bric-a-brac,

his darling, his title to public consideration,

envy, veneration, and his first solicitude when he gets

ready to make his will.  The true Black Forest novel,

if it is ever written, will be skeletoned somewhat in this way:



SKELETON FOR A BLACK FOREST NOVEL



Rich old farmer, named Huss.  Has inherited great wealth

of manure, and by diligence has added to it.  It is

double-starred in Baedeker.  [1] The Black forest artist

paints it--his masterpiece.  The king comes to see it. 

Gretchen Huss, daughter and heiress.  Paul Hoch,

young neighbor, suitor for Gretchen's hand--ostensibly;

he really wants the manure.  Hoch has a good many cart-loads

of the Black Forest currency himself, and therefore is a

good catch; but he is sordid, mean, and without sentiment,

whereas Gretchen is all sentiment and poetry. 

Hans Schmidt, young neighbor, full of sentiment,

full of poetry, loves Gretchen, Gretchen loves him. 

But he has no manure.  Old Huss forbids him in the house. 

His heart breaks, he goes away to die in the woods,

far from the cruel world--for he says, bitterly, "What is man,

without manure?"



1.  When Baedeker's guide-books mention a thing and put

    two stars (**) after it, it means well worth visiting. 

    M.T.



[Interval of six months.]



Paul Hoch comes to old Huss and says, "I am at last

as rich as you required--come and view the pile."

Old Huss views it and says, "It is sufficient--take

her and be happy,"--meaning Gretchen. 



[Interval of two weeks.]



Wedding party assembled in old Huss's drawing-room. Hoch

placid and content, Gretchen weeping over her hard fate. 

Enter old Huss's head bookkeeper.  Huss says fiercely,

"I gave you three weeks to find out why your books

don't balance, and to prove that you are not a defaulter;

the time is up--find me the missing property or you go

to prison as a thief." Bookkeeper: "I have found it."

"Where?" Bookkeeper (sternly--tragically): "In the bridegroom's

pile!--behold the thief--see him blench and tremble!"

[Sensation.] Paul Hoch: Lost, lost!"--falls over the cow

in a swoon and is handcuffed.  Gretchen: "Saved!" Falls

over the calf in a swoon of joy, but is caught in the arms

of Hans Schmidt, who springs in at that moment.  Old Huss:

"What, you here, varlet? Unhand the maid and quit the place."

Hans (still supporting the insensible girl): "Never! Cruel

old man, know that I come with claims which even you

cannot despise."



Huss: "What, YOU? name them."



Hans: "Listen then.  The world has forsaken me, I forsook

the world, I wandered in the solitude of the forest,

longing for death but finding none.  I fed upon roots,

and in my bitterness I dug for the bitterest,

loathing the sweeter kind.  Digging, three days agone,

I struck a manure mine!--a Golconda, a limitless Bonanza,

of solid manure! I can buy you ALL, and have mountain

ranges of manure left! Ha-ha, NOW thou smilest a smile!"

[Immense sensation.] Exhibition of specimens from the mine. 

Old Huss (enthusiastically): "Wake her up, shake her up,

noble young man, she is yours!" Wedding takes place on

the spot; bookkeeper restored to his office and emoluments;

Paul Hoch led off to jail.  The Bonanza king of the Black

Forest lives to a good old age, blessed with the love of his

wife and of his twenty-seven children, and the still sweeter

envy of everybody around. 



We took our noon meal of fried trout one day at the Plow Inn,

in a very pretty village (Ottenho"fen), and then went into

the public room to rest and smoke.  There we found nine

or ten Black Forest grandees assembled around a table. 

They were the Common Council of the parish.  They had

gathered there at eight o'clock that morning to elect

a new member, and they had now been drinking beer four

hours at the new member's expense.  They were men of fifty

or sixty years of age, with grave good-natures faces,

and were all dressed in the costume made familiar to us

by the Black Forest stories; broad, round-topped black felt

hats with the brims curled up all round; long red waistcoats

with large metal buttons, black alpaca coats with the

waists up between the shoulders.  There were no speeches,

there was but little talk, there were no frivolities;

the Council filled themselves gradually, steadily, but surely,

with beer, and conducted themselves with sedate decorum,

as became men of position, men of influence, men of manure. 



We had a hot afternoon tramp up the valley, along the grassy

bank of a rushing stream of clear water, past farmhouses,

water-mills, and no end of wayside crucifixes and saints

and Virgins.  These crucifixes, etc., are set up in

memory of departed friends, by survivors, and are almost

as frequent as telegraph-poles are in other lands. 



We followed the carriage-road, and had our usual luck;

we traveled under a beating sun, and always saw the shade

leave the shady places before we could get to them. 

In all our wanderings we seldom managed to strike

a piece of road at its time for being shady.  We had a

particularly hot time of it on that particular afternoon,

and with no comfort but what we could get out of the fact

that the peasants at work away up on the steep mountainsides

above our heads were even worse off than we were. 

By and by it became impossible to endure the intolerable

glare and heat any longer; so we struck across the ravine

and entered the deep cool twilight of the forest, to hunt

for what the guide-book called the "old road."



We found an old road, and it proved eventually to be the

right one, though we followed it at the time with the conviction

that it was the wrong one.  If it was the wrong one there

could be no use in hurrying; therefore we did not hurry,

but sat down frequently on the soft moss and enjoyed

the restful quiet and shade of the forest solitudes. 

There had been distractions in the carriage-road--

school-children, peasants, wagons, troops of

pedestrianizing students from all over Germany--

but we had the old road to ourselves. 



Now and then, while we rested, we watched the laborious

ant at his work.  I found nothing new in him--certainly

nothing to change my opinion of him.  It seems to me that

in the matter of intellect the ant must be a strangely

overrated bird.  During many summers, now, I have watched him,

when I ought to have been in better business, and I have

not yet come across a living ant that seemed to have any

more sense than a dead one.  I refer to the ordinary ant,

of course; I have had no experience of those wonderful

Swiss and African ones which vote, keep drilled armies,

hold slaves, and dispute about religion.  Those particular

ants may be all that the naturalist paints them,

but I am persuaded that the average ant is a sham. 

I admit his industry, of course; he is the hardest-working

creature in the world--when anybody is looking--but his

leather-headedness is the point I make against him. 

He goes out foraging, he makes a capture, and then what

does he do? Go home? No--he goes anywhere but home. 

He doesn't know where home is.  His home may be only

three feet away--no matter, he can't find it.  He makes

his capture, as I have said; it is generally something

which can be of no sort of use to himself or anybody else;

it is usually seven times bigger than it ought to be;

he hunts out the awkwardest place to take hold of it;

he lifts it bodily up in the air by main force, and starts;

not toward home, but in the opposite direction; not calmly

and wisely, but with a frantic haste which is wasteful

of his strength; he fetches up against a pebble, and instead

of going around it, he climbs over it backward dragging

his booty after him, tumbles down on the other side,

jumps up in a passion, kicks the dust off his clothes,

moistens his hands, grabs his property viciously, yanks it

this way, then that, shoves it ahead of him a moment,

turns tail and lugs it after him another moment, gets madder

and madder, then presently hoists it into the air and goes

tearing away in an entirely new direction; comes to a weed;

it never occurs to him to go around it; no, he must climb it;

and he does climb it, dragging his worthless property

to the top--which is as bright a thing to do as it would

be for me to carry a sack of flour from Heidelberg to Paris

by way of Strasburg steeple; when he gets up there he

finds that that is not the place; takes a cursory glance

at the scenery and either climbs down again or tumbles down,

and starts off once more--as usual, in a new direction. 

At the end of half an hour, he fetches up within six inches

of the place he started from and lays his burden down;

meantime he as been over all the ground for two yards around,

and climbed all the weeds and pebbles he came across. 

Now he wipes the sweat from his brow, strokes his limbs,

and then marches aimlessly off, in as violently a hurry

as ever.  He does not remember to have ever seen it before;

he looks around to see which is not the way home, grabs his

bundle and starts; he goes through the same adventures he

had before; finally stops to rest, and a friend comes along. 

Evidently the friend remarks that a last year's grasshopper

leg is a very noble acquisition, and inquires where he

got it.  Evidently the proprietor does not remember

exactly where he did get it, but thinks he got it "around

here somewhere." Evidently the friend contracts to help

him freight it home.  Then, with a judgment peculiarly

antic (pun not intended), then take hold of opposite ends

of that grasshopper leg a nd begin to tug with all their

might in opposite directions.  Presently they take a rest

and confer together.  They decide that something is wrong,

they can't make out what.  Then they go at it again,

just as before.  Same result.  Mutual recriminations follow. 

Evidently each accuses the other of being an obstructionist. 

They lock themselves together and chew each other's jaws

for a while; then they roll and tumble on the ground till

one loses a horn or a leg and has to haul off for repairs. 

They make up and go to work again in the same old insane way,

but the crippled ant is at a disadvantage; tug as he may,

the other one drags off the booty and him at the end of it. 

Instead of giving up, he hangs on, and gets his shins

bruised against every obstruction that comes in the way. 

By and by, when that grasshopper leg has been dragged

all over the same old ground once more, it is finally

dumped at about the spot where it originally lay,

the two perspiring ants inspect it thoughtfully and decide

that dried grasshopper legs are a poor sort of property

after all, and then each starts off in a different

direction to see if he can't find an old nail or something

else that is heavy enough to afford entertainment and at

the same time valueless enough to make an ant want to own it.



There in the Black Forest, on the mountainside,

I saw an ant go through with such a performance as this

with a dead spider of fully ten times his own weight. 

The spider was not quite dead, but too far gone to resist. 

He had a round body the size of a pea.  The little ant--

observing that I was noticing--turned him on his back,

sunk his fangs into his throat, lifted him into the air and

started vigorously off with him, stumbling over little pebbles,

stepping on the spider's legs and tripping himself up,

dragging him backward, shoving him bodily ahead, dragging him

up stones six inches high instead of going around them,

climbing weeds twenty times his own height and jumping

from their summits--and finally leaving him in the middle

of the road to be confiscated by any other fool of an

ant that wanted him.  I measured the ground which this

ass traversed, and arrived at the conclusion that what he

had accomplished inside of twenty minutes would constitute

some such job as this--relatively speaking--for a man;

to wit: to strap two eight-hundred-pound horses together,

carry them eighteen hundred feet, mainly over (not around)

boulders averaging six feet high, and in the course

of the journey climb up and jump from the top of one

precipice like Niagara, and three steeples, each a hundred

and twenty feet high; and then put the horses down,

in an exposed place, without anybody to watch them,

and go off to indulge in some other idiotic miracle for

vanity's sake. 



Science has recently discovered that the ant does not

lay up anything for winter use.  This will knock him

out of literature, to some extent.  He does not work,

except when people are looking, and only then when the

observer has a green, naturalistic look, and seems to be

taking notes.  This amounts to deception, and will injure

him for the Sunday-schools. He has not judgment enough

to know what is good to eat from what isn't. This amounts

to ignorance, and will impair the world's respect for him. 

He cannot stroll around a stump and find his way home again. 

This amounts to idiocy, and once the damaging fact

is established, thoughtful people will cease to look

up to him, the sentimental will cease to fondle him. 

His vaunted industry is but a vanity and of no effect,

since he never gets home with anything he starts with. 

This disposes of the last remnant of his reputation

and wholly destroys his main usefulness as a moral agent,

since it will make the sluggard hesitate to go to him

any more.  It is strange, beyond comprehension, that so

manifest a humbug as the ant has been able to fool so

many nations and keep it up so many ages without being

found out. 



The ant is strong, but we saw another strong thing,

where we had not suspected the presence of much muscular

power before.  A toadstool--that vegetable which springs

to full growth in a single night--had torn loose and

lifted a matted mass of pine needles and dirt of twice

its own bulk into the air, and supported it there,

like a column supporting a shed.  Ten thousand toadstools,

with the right purchase, could lift a man, I suppose. 

But what good would it do?



All our afternoon's progress had been uphill.  About five

or half past we reached the summit, and all of a sudden

the dense curtain of the forest parted and we looked

down into a deep and beautiful gorge and out over a

wide panorama of wooded mountains with their summits

shining in the sun and their glade-furrowed sides dimmed

with purple shade.  The gorge under our feet--called

Allerheiligen--afforded room in the grassy level at its

head for a cozy and delightful human nest, shut away

from the world and its botherations, and consequently

the monks of the old times had not failed to spy it out;

and here were the brown and comely ruins of their church

and convent to prove that priests had as fine an instinct

seven hundred years ago in ferreting out the choicest

nooks and corners in a land as priests have today. 



A big hotel crowds the ruins a little, now, and drives

a brisk trade with summer tourists.  We descended

into the gorge and had a supper which would have been

very satisfactory if the trout had not been boiled. 

The Germans are pretty sure to boil a trout or anything

else if left to their own devices.  This is an argument

of some value in support of the theory that they were

the original colonists of the wild islands of the coast

of Scotland.  A schooner laden with oranges was wrecked

upon one of those islands a few years ago, and the gentle

savages rendered the captain such willing assistance

that he gave them as many oranges as they wanted. 

Next day he asked them how they liked them.  They shook

their heads and said:



"Baked, they were tough; and even boiled, they warn't

things for a hungry man to hanker after."



We went down the glen after supper.  It is beautiful--a

mixture of sylvan loveliness and craggy wildness. 

A limpid torrent goes whistling down the glen, and toward

the foot of it winds through a narrow cleft between lofty

precipices and hurls itself over a succession of falls. 

After one passes the last of these he has a backward

glimpse at the falls which is very pleasing--they rise

in a seven-stepped stairway of foamy and glittering cascades,

and make a picture which is as charming as it is unusual.
