<P>The next morning we were up and dressed at ten o'clock. We went to the
<I>commissionaire </I>of the hotel--I don't know what a <I>commissionaire
</I>is, but that is the man we went to--and told him we wanted a guide.
He said the national Exposition had drawn such multitudes of Englishmen
and Americans to Paris that it would be next to impossible to find a good
guide unemployed. He said he usually kept a dozen or two on hand, but he
only had three now. He called them. One looked so like a very pirate that
we let him go at once. The next one spoke with a simpering precision of
pronunciation that was irritating and said:

<P>"If ze zhentlemans will to me make ze grande honneur to me rattain in
hees serveece, I shall show to him everysing zat is magnifique to look
upon in ze beautiful Parree. I speaky ze Angleesh pairfaitemaw."

<P>He would have done well to have stopped there, because he had that much
by heart and said it right off without making a mistake. But his self-complacency
seduced him into attempting a flight into regions of unexplored English,
and the reckless experiment was his ruin. Within ten seconds he was so
tangled up in a maze of mutilated verbs and torn and bleeding forms of
speech that no human ingenuity could ever have gotten him out of it with
credit. It was plain enough that he could not "speaky" the English quite
as "pairfaitemaw" as he had pretended he could.

<P>The third man captured us. He was plainly dressed, but he had a noticeable
air of neatness about him. He wore a high silk hat which was a little old,
but had been carefully brushed. He wore secondhand kid gloves, in good
repair, and carried a small rattan cane with a curved handle--a female
leg--of ivory. He stepped as gently and as daintily as a cat crossing a
muddy street; and oh, he was urbanity; he was quiet, unobtrusive self-possession;
he was deference itself! He spoke softly and guardedly; and when he was
about to make a statement on his sole responsibility or offer a suggestion,
he weighed it by drachms and scruples first, with the crook of his little
stick placed meditatively to his teeth. His opening speech was perfect.
It was perfect in construction, in phraseology, in grammar, in emphasis,
in pronunciation--everything. He spoke little and guardedly after that.
We were charmed. We were more than charmed--we were overjoyed. We hired
him at once. We never even asked him his price. This man--our lackey, our
servant, our unquestioning slave though he was--was still a gentleman--we
could see that--while of the other two one was coarse and awkward and the
other was a born pirate. We asked our man Friday's name. He drew from his
pocketbook a snowy little card and passed it to us with a profound bow:

<BLOCKQUOTE>A. BILLFINGER</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Guide to Paris, France, Germany,

<P>"Billfinger! Oh, carry me home to die!"

<P>That was an "aside" from Dan. The atrocious name grated harshly on my
ear, too. The most of us can learn to forgive, and even to like, a countenance
that strikes us unpleasantly at first, but few of us, I fancy, become reconciled
to a jarring name so easily. I was almost sorry we had hired this man,
his name was so unbearable. However, no matter. We were impatient to start.
Billfinger stepped to the door to call a carriage, and then the doctor
said:

<P>"Well, the guide goes with the barbershop, with the billiard table,
with the gasless room, and maybe with many another pretty romance of Paris.
I expected to have a guide named Henri de Montmorency or Armand de la Chartreuse
Or something that would sound grand in letters to the villagers at home,
but to think of a Frenchman by the name of Billfinger! Oh! This is absurd,
you know. This will never do. We can't say Billfinger; it is nauseating.
Name him over again; what had we better call him? Alexis du Caulaincourt?"

<P>"Alphonse Henri Gustave de Hauteville," I suggested.

<P>"Call him Ferguson," said Dan.

<P>That was practical, unromantic good sense. Without debate, we expunged
Billfinger <I>as </I>Billfinger and called him Ferguson.

<P>The carriage--an open barouche--was ready. Ferguson mounted beside the
driver, and we whirled away to breakfast. As was proper, Mr. Ferguson stood
by to transmit our orders and answer questions. By and by, he mentioned
casually--the artful adventurer--that he would go and get his breakfast
as soon as we had finished ours. He knew we could not get along without
him and that we would not want to loiter about and wait for him. We asked
him to sit down and eat with us. He begged, with many a bow, to be excused.
It was not proper, he said; he would sit at another table. We ordered him
peremptorily to sit down with us.

<P>Here endeth the first lesson. It was a mistake.

<P>As long as we had that fellow after that, he was always hungry; he was
always thirsty. He came early; he stayed late; he could not pass a restaurant;
he looked with a lecherous eye upon every wineshop. Suggestions to stop,
excuses to eat and to drink, were forever on his lips. We tried all we
could to fill him so full that he would have no room to spare for a fortnight,
but it was a failure. He did not , hold enough to smother the cravings
of his superhuman appetite.

<P>He had another "discrepancy" about him. He was always wanting us to
buy things. On the shallowest pretenses he would inveigle us into shirt
stores, boot stores, tailor shops, glove shops--anywhere under the broad
sweep of the heavens that there seemed a chance of our buying anything.
Anyone could have guessed that the shopkeepers paid him a percentage on
the sales, but in our blessed innocence we didn't until this feature of
his conduct grew unbearably prominent. One day Dan happened to mention
that he thought of buying three or four silk dress patterns for presents.
Ferguson's hungry eye was upon him in an instant. In the course of twenty
minutes the carriage stopped.

<P>"What's this?"

<P>"Zis is ze finest silk <I>magasin </I>in Paris--ze most celebrate."

<P>"What did you come here for? We told you to take us to the palace of
the Louvre."

<P>"I suppose ze gentleman say he wish to buy some silk."

<P>"You are not required to 'suppose' things for the party, Ferguson. We
do not wish to tax your energies too much. We will bear some of the burden
and heat of the day ourselves. We will endeavor to do such 'supposing'
as is really necessary to be done. Drive on." So spake the doctor.

<P>Within fifteen minutes the carriage halted again, and before another
silk store. The doctor said:

<P>"Ah, the palace of the Louvre--beautiful, beautiful edifice! Does the
Emperor Napoleon live here now, Ferguson?"

<P>"Ah, Doctor! You do jest; zis is not ze palace; we come there directly.
But since we pass right by zis store, where is such beautiful silk--'

<P>"Ah! I see, I see. I meant to have told you that we did not wish to
purchase any silks today, but in my absentmindedness I forgot it. I also
meant to tell you we wished to go directly to the Louvre, but I forgot
that also. However, we will go there now. Pardon my seeming carelessness,
Ferguson. Drive on."

<P>Within the half hour we stopped again--in front of another silk store.
We were angry; but the doctor was always serene, always smooth-voiced.
He said:

<P>"At last! How imposing the Louvre is, and yet how small! How exquisitely
fashioned! How charmingly situated! Venerable, venerable pile--"

<P>"Pairdon, Doctor, zis is not ze Louvre--it is--"

<P><I>"What </I>is it?'

<P>"I have ze idea--it come to me in a moment--zat ze silk in zis <I>magasin--"</I>

<P>"Ferguson, how heedless I am. I fully intended to tell you that we did
not wish to buy any silks today, and I also intended to tell you that we
yearned to go immediately to the palace of the Louvre, but enjoying the
happiness of seeing you devour four breakfasts this morning has so filled
me with pleasurable emotions that I neglect the commonest interests of
the time. However, we will proceed now to the Louvre, Ferguson."

<P>"But, Doctor" (excitedly), "it will take not a minute--not but one small
minute! Ze gentleman need not to buy if he not wish to--but only <I>look
</I>at ze silk--<I>look</I> at ze beautiful fabric. [Then pleadingly.]
<I>Sair</I>--just only one <I>leetle </I>moment!"

<P>Dan said, "Confound the idiot! I don't want to see any silks today,
and I <I>won't </I>look at them. Drive on."

<P>And the doctor: "We need no silks now, Ferguson. Our hearts yearn for
the Louvre. Let us journey on--let us journey on."

<P>"But, <I>Doctor! </I>It is only one moment--one leetle moment. And ze
time will be save--entirely save! Because zere is nothing to see now--it
is too late. It want ten minute to four and ze Louvre close at four--<I>only</I>
one leetle moment, Doctor!"

<P>The treacherous miscreant! After four breakfasts and a gallon of champagne,
to serve us such a scurvy trick. We got no sight of the countless treasures
of art in the Louvre galleries that day, and our only poor little satisfaction
was in the reflection that Ferguson sold not a solitary silk dress pattern.

<P>I am writing this chapter partly for the satisfaction of abusing that
accomplished knave Billfinger, and partly to show whosoever shall read
this how Americans fare at the hands of the Paris guides and what sort
of people Paris guides are. It need not be supposed that we were a stupider
or an easier prey than our countrymen generally are, for we were not. The
guides deceive and defraud every American who goes to Paris for the first
time and sees its sights alone or in company with others as little experienced
as himself. I shall visit Paris again someday, and then let the guides
beware! I shall go in my war paint--I shall carry my tomahawk along.

<P>I think we have lost but little time in Paris. We have gone to bed every
night tired out. Of course we visited the renowned International Exposition.
All the world did that. We went there on our third day in Paris--and we
stayed there <I>nearly two hours. </I>That was our first and last visit.
To tell the truth, we saw at a glance that one would have to spend weeks--yea,
even months--in that monstrous establishment to get an intelligible idea
of it. It was a wonderful show, but the moving masses of people of all
nations we saw there were a still more wonderful show. I discovered that
if I were to stay there a month, I should still find myself looking at
the people instead of the inanimate objects on exhibition. I got a little
interested in some curious old tapestries of the thirteenth century, but
a party of Arabs came by, and their dusky faces and quaint costumes called
my attention away at once. I watched a silver swan, which had a living
grace about his movements and a living intelligence in his eyes--watched
him swimming about as comfortably and as unconcernedly as if he had been
born in a morass instead of a jeweler's shop--watched him seize a silver
fish from under the water and hold up his head and go through all the customary
and elaborate motions of swallowing it--but the moment it disappeared down
his throat some tattooed South Sea Islanders approached and I yielded to
their attractions. Presently I found a revolving pistol several hundred
years old which looked strangely like a modern Colt, but just then I heard
that the Empress of the French was in another part of the building, and
hastened away to see what she might look like. We heard martial music--we
saw an unusual number of soldiers walking hurriedly about--there was a
general movement among the people. We inquired what it was all about and
learned that the Emperor of the French and the Sultan of Turkey were about
to review twenty-five thousand troops at the Arc de l'Etoile. We immediately
departed. I had a greater anxiety to see these men than I could have had
to see twenty expositions.

<P>We drove away and took up a position in an open space opposite the American
minister's house. A speculator bridged a couple of barrels with a board
and we hired standing places on it. Presently there was a sound of distant
music; in another minute a pillar of dust came moving slowly toward us;
a moment more and then, with colors flying and a grand crash of military
music, a gallant array of cavalrymen emerged from the dust and came down
the street on a gentle trot. After them came a long line of artillery;
then more cavalry, in splendid uniforms; and then their imperial majesties
Napoleon III and Abdul-Aziz. The vast concourse of people swung their hats
and shouted--the windows and housetops in the wide vicinity burst into
a snowstorm of waving handkerchiefs, and the wavers of the same mingled
their cheers with those of the masses below. It was a stirring spectacle.

<P>But the two central figures claimed all my attention. Was ever such
a contrast set up before a multitude till then? Napoleon in military uniform--a
long-bodied, short-legged man, fiercely moustached, old, wrinkled, with
eyes half closed, and <I>such </I>a deep, crafty, scheming expression about
them! Napoleon bowing ever so gently to the loud plaudits, and watching
everything and everybody with his cat eyes from under his depressed hat
brim, as if to discover any sign that those cheers were not heartfelt and
cordial.

<P>Abdul-Aziz, absolute lord of the Ottoman empire--clad in dark green
European clothes, almost without ornament or insignia of rank; a red Turkish
fez on his head; a short, stout, dark man, black-bearded, black-eyed, stupid,
unprepossessing--a man whose whole appearance somehow suggested that if
he only had a cleaver in his hand and a white apron on, one would not be
at all surprised to hear him say: "A mutton roast today, or will you have
a nice porterhouse steak?"

<P>Napoleon III, the representative of the highest modem civilization,
progress, and refinement; Abdul-Aziz, the representative of a people by
nature and training filthy, brutish, ignorant, unprogressive, superstitious--and
a government whose Three Graces are Tyranny, Rapacity, Blood. Here in brilliant
Paris, under this majestic Arch of Triumph, the first century greets the
nineteenth

<P>Napoleon III, Emperor of France! Surrounded by shouting thousands, by
military pomp, by the splendors of his capital city, and companioned by
kings and princes--this is the man who was sneered at and reviled and called
Bastard--yet who was dreaming of a crown and an empire all the while; who
was driven into exile--but carried his dreams with him; who associated
with the common herd in America and ran foot races for a wager--but still
sat upon a throne in fancy; who braved every danger to go to his dying
mother--and grieved that she could not be spared to see him cast aside
his plebeian vestments for the purple of royalty; who kept his faithful
watch and walked his weary beat a common policeman of London--but dreamed
the while of a coming night when he should tread the long-drawn corridors
of the Tuileries; who made the miserable fiasco of Strasbourg; saw his
poor, shabby eagle, forgetful of its lesson, refuse to perch upon his shoulder;
delivered his carefully prepared, sententious burst of eloquence unto unsympathetic
ears; found himself a prisoner, the butt of small wits, a mark for the
pitiless ridicule of all the world--yet went on dreaming of coronations
and splendid pageants as before; who lay a forgotten captive in the dungeons
of Ham--and still schemed and planned and pondered over future glory and
future power; President of France at last! a <I>coup d'etat, </I>and surrounded
by applauding armies, welcomed by the thunders of cannon, he mounts a throne
and waves before an astounded world the scepter of a mighty empire! Who
talks of the marvels of fiction? Who speaks of the wonders of romance?
Who prates of the tame achievements of Aladdin and the Magii of Arabia?

<P>Abdul-Aziz, Sultan of Turkey, Lord of the Ottoman Empire! Born to a
throne; weak, stupid, ignorant, almost, as his meanest slave; chief of
a vast royalty, yet the puppet of his premier and the obedient child of
a tyrannical mother; a man who sits upon a throne--the beck of whose finger
moves navies and armies--who holds in his hands the power of life and death
over millions--yet who sleeps, sleeps, eats, eats, idles with his eight
hundred concubines, and when he is surfeited with eating and sleeping and
idling, and would rouse up and take the reins of government and threaten
to <I>be </I>a sultan, is charmed from his purpose by wary Fuad Pasha with
a pretty plan for a new palace or a new ship--charmed away with a new toy,
like any other restless child; a man who sees his people robbed and oppressed
by soulless tax gatherers, but speaks no word to save them; who believes
in gnomes and genii and the wild fables of <I>The Arabian Nights, </I>but
has small regard for the mighty magicians of today and is nervous in the
presence of their mysterious railroads and steamboats and telegraphs; who
would see undone in Egypt all that great Mehemet Ali achieved and would
prefer rather to forget than emulate him; a man who found his great empire
a blot upon the earth--a degraded, poverty-stricken, miserable, infamous
agglomeration of ignorance, crime, and brutality--and will idle away the
allotted days of his trivial life and then pass to the dust and the worms
and leave it so!

<P>Napoleon has augmented the commercial prosperity of France in ten years
to such a degree that figures can hardly compute it. He has rebuilt Paris
and has partly rebuilt every city in the state. He condemns a whole street
at a time, assesses the damages, pays them, and rebuilds superbly. Then
speculators buy up the ground and sell, but the original owner is given
the first choice by the government at a stated price before the speculator
is permitted to purchase. But above all things, he has taken the sole control
of the empire of France into his hands and made it a tolerably free land--for
people who will not attempt to go too far in meddling with government affairs.
No country offers greater security to life and property than France, and
one has all the freedom he wants, but no license--no license to interfere
with anybody or make anyone uncomfortable.

<P>As for the Sultan, one could set a trap anywhere and catch a dozen abler
men in a night.

<P>The bands struck up, and the brilliant adventurer, Napoleon III, the
genius of Energy, Persistence, Enterprise, and the feeble Abdul-Aziz, the
genius of Ignorance, Bigotry, and Indolence, prepared for the Forward--March!

<P>We saw the splendid review, we saw the white-moustached old Crimean
soldier Canrobert, marshal of France, we saw--well, we saw everything,
and then we went home satisfied.
