<P>A week of buffeting a tempestuous and relentless sea; a week of seasickness
and deserted cabins; of lonely quarterdecks drenched with spray--spray
so ambitious that it even coated the smokestacks thick with a white crust
of salt to their very tops; a week of shivering in the shelter of the lifeboats
and deckhouses by day and blowing suffocating "clouds" and boisterously
performing at dominoes in the smoking room at night.

<P>And the last night of the seven was the stormiest of all. There was
no thunder, no noise but the pounding bows of the ship, the keen whistling
of the gale through the cordage, and the rush of the seething waters. But
the vessel climbed aloft as if she would climb to heaven--then paused an
instant that seemed a century and plunged headlong down again, as from
a precipice. The sheeted sprays drenched the decks like rain. The blackness
of darkness was everywhere. At long intervals a flash of lightning clove
it with a quivering line of fire that revealed a heaving world of water
where was nothing before, kindled the dusky cordage to glittering silver,
and lit up the faces of the men with a ghastly luster!

<P>Fear drove many on deck that were used to avoiding the night winds and
the spray. Some thought the vessel could not live through the night, and
it seemed less dreadful to stand out in the midst of the wild tempest and
<I>see </I>the peril that threatened than to be shut up in the sepulchral
cabins, under the dim lamps, and imagine the horrors that were abroad on
the ocean. And once out--once where they could see the ship struggling
in the strong grasp of the storm--once where they could hear the shriek
of the winds and face the driving spray and look out upon the majestic
picture the lightnings disclosed, they were prisoners to a fierce fascination
they could not resist, and so remained. It was a wild night--and a very,
very long one.

<P>Everybody was sent scampering to the deck at seven o'clock this lovely
morning of the thirtieth of June with the glad news that land was in sight!
It was a rare thing and a joyful, to see <I>all</I> the ship's family abroad
once more, albeit the happiness that sat upon every countenance could only
partly conceal the ravages which that long siege of storms had wrought
there. But dull eyes soon sparkled with pleasure, pallid cheeks flushed
again, and frames weakened by sickness gathered new life from the quickening
influences of the bright, fresh morning. Yea, and from a still more potent
influence: the worn castaways were to see the blessed land again!--and
to see it was to bring back that motherland that was in all their thoughts.

<P>Within the hour we were fairly within the Straits of Gibraltar, the
tall yellow-splotched hills of Africa on our right, with their bases veiled
in a blue haze and their summits swathed in clouds--the same being according
to Scripture, which says that "clouds and darkness are over the land."
The words were spoken of this particular portion of Africa, I believe.
On our left were the granite-ribbed domes of old Spain. The strait is only
thirteen miles wide in its narrowest part.

<P>At short intervals along the Spanish shore were quaint-looking old stone
towers--Moorish, we thought--but learned better afterwards. In former times
the Morocco rascals used to coast along the Spanish Main in their boats
till a safe opportunity seemed to present itself, and then dart in and
capture a Spanish village and carry off all the pretty women they could
find. It was a pleasant business, and was very popular. The Spaniards built
these watchtowers on the hills to enable them to keep a sharper lookout
on the Moroccan speculators.

<P>The picture on the other hand was very beautiful to eyes weary of the
changeless sea, and by and by the ship's company grew wonderfully cheerful.
But while we stood admiring the cloud-capped peaks and the lowlands robed
in misty gloom a finer picture burst upon us and chained every eye like
a magnet--a stately ship, with canvas piled on canvas till she was one
towering mass of bellying sail! She came speeding over the sea like a great
bird. Africa and Spain were forgotten. All homage was for the beautiful
stranger. While everybody gazed she swept superbly by and flung the Stars
and Stripes to the breeze! Quicker than thought, hats and handkerchiefs
flashed in the air, and a cheer went up! She was beautiful before--she
was radiant now. Many a one on our decks knew then for the first time how
tame a sight his country's flag is at home compared to what it is in a
foreign land. To see it is to see a vision of home itself and all its idols,
and feel a thrill that would stir a very river of sluggish blood!

<P>We were approaching the famed Pillars of Hercules, and already the African
one, "Ape's Hill," a grand old mountain with summit streaked with granite
ledges, was in sight. The other, the great Rock of Gibraltar, was yet to
come. The ancients considered the Pillars of Hercules the head of navigation
and the end of the world. The information the ancients didn't have was
very voluminous. Even the prophets wrote book after book and epistle after
epistle, yet never once hinted at the existence of a great continent on
our side of the water; yet they must have known it was there, I should
think.

<P>In a few moments a lonely and enormous mass of rock, standing seemingly
in the center of the wide strait and apparently washed on all sides by
the sea, swung magnificently into view, and we needed no tedious traveled
parrot to tell us it was Gibraltar. There could not be two rocks like that
in one kingdom.

<P>The Rock of Gibraltar is about a mile and a half long, I should say,
by 1,400 to 1,500 feet high, and a quarter of a mile wide at its base.
One side and one end of it come about as straight up out of the sea as
the side of a house, the other end is irregular and the other side is a
steep slant which an army would find very difficult to climb. At the foot
of this slant is the walled town of Gibraltar--or rather the town occupies
part of the slant. Everywhere--on hillside, in the precipice, by the sea,
on the heights--everywhere you choose to look, Gibraltar is clad with masonry
and bristling with guns. It makes a striking and lively picture from whatsoever
point you contemplate it. It is pushed out into the sea on the end of a
flat, narrow strip of land, and is suggestive of a "gob" of mud on the
end of a shingle. A few hundred yards of this flat ground at its base belongs
to the English, and then, extending across the strip from the Atlantic
to the Mediterranean, a distance of a quarter of a mile, comes the "Neutral
Ground," a space two or three hundred yards wide, which is free to both
parties.

<P>"Are you going through Spain to Paris?" That question was bandied about
the ship day and night from Fayal to Gibraltar, and I thought I never could
get so tired of hearing any one combination of words again or more tired
of answering, "I don't know." At the last moment six or seven had sufficient
decision of character to make up their minds to go, and did go, and I felt
a sense of relief at once--it was forever too late now and I could make
up my mind at my leisure not to go. I must have a prodigious quantity of
mind; it takes me as much as a week sometimes to make it up.

<P>But behold how annoyances repeat themselves. We had no sooner gotten
rid of the Spain distress than the Gibraltar guides started another--a
tiresome repetition of a legend that had nothing very astonishing about
it, even in the first place: "That high hill yonder is called the Queen's
Chair; it is because one of the queens of Spain placed her chair there
when the French and Spanish troops were besieging Gibraltar, and said she
would never move from the spot till the English flag was lowered from the
fortresses. If the English hadn't been gallant enough to lower the flag
for a few hours one day, she'd have had to break her oath or die up there."

<P>We rode on asses and mules up the steep, narrow streets and entered
the subterranean galleries the English have blasted out in the rock. These
galleries are like spacious railway tunnels, and at short intervals in
them great guns frown out upon sea and town through portholes five or six
hundred feet above the ocean. There is a mile or so of this subterranean
work, and it must have cost a vast deal of money and labor. The gallery
guns command the peninsula and the harbors of both oceans, but they might
as well not be there, I should think, for an army could hardly climb the
perpendicular wall of the rock anyhow. Those lofty portholes afford superb
views of the sea, though. At one place, where a jutting crag was hollowed
out into a great chamber whose furniture was huge cannon and whose windows
were portholes, a glimpse was caught of a hill not far away, and a soldier
said:

<P>"That high hill yonder is called the Queen's Chair; it is because a
queen of Spain placed her chair there once when the French and Spanish
troops were besieging Gibraltar, and said she would never move from the
spot till the English flag was lowered from the fortresses. If the English
hadn't been gallant enough to lower the flag for a few hours one day, she'd
have had to break her oath or die up there."

<P>On the topmost pinnacle of Gibraltar we halted a good while, and no
doubt the mules were tired. They had a right to be. The military road was
good, but rather steep, and there was a good deal of it. The view from
the narrow ledge was magnificent; from it vessels seeming like the tiniest
little toy boats were turned into noble ships by the telescopes, and other
vessels that were fifty miles away and even sixty, they said, and invisible
to the naked eye, could be clearly distinguished through those same telescopes.
Below, on one side, we looked down upon an endless mass of batteries and
on the other straight down to the sea.

<P>While I was resting ever so comfortably on a rampart, and cooling my
baking head in the delicious breeze, an officious guide belonging to another
party came up and said:

<P>"Se&ntilde;or, that high hill yonder is called the Queen's Chair--"

<P>Sir, I am a helpless orphan in a foreign land. Have pity on me. Don't--now
<I>don't</I> inflict that most in-FERNAL old legend on me anymore today!"

<P>There--I had used strong language after promising I would never do so
again; but the provocation was more than human nature could bear. If you
had been bored so, when you had the noble panorama of Spain and Africa
and the blue Mediterranean spread abroad at your feet, and wanted to gaze
and enjoy and surfeit yourself in its beauty in silence, you might have
even burst into stronger language than I did.

<P>Gibraltar has stood several protracted sieges, one of them of nearly
four years' duration (it failed), and the English only captured it by stratagem.
The wonder is that anybody should ever dream of trying so impossible a
project as the taking it by assault--and yet it has been tried more than
once.

<P>The Moors held the place twelve hundred years ago, and a staunch old
castle of theirs of that date still frowns from the middle of the town,
with moss-grown battlements and sides well scarred by shots fired in battles
and sieges that are forgotten now. A secret chamber in the rock behind
it was discovered some time ago, which contained a sword of exquisite workmanship,
and some quaint old armor of a fashion that antiquaries are not acquainted
with, though it is supposed to be Roman. Roman armor and Roman relics of
various kinds have been found in a cave in the sea extremity of Gibraltar;
history says Rome held this part of the country about the Christian era,
and these things seem to confirm the statement.

<P>In that cave also are found human bones, crusted with a very thick,
stony coating, and wise men have ventured to say that those men not only
lived before the flood, but as much as ten thousand years before it. It
may be true--it looks reasonable enough--but as long as those parties can't
vote anymore, the matter can be of no great public interest. In this cave
likewise are found skeletons and fossils of animals that exist in every
part of Africa, yet within memory and tradition have never existed in any
portion of Spain save this lone peak of Gibraltar! So the theory is that
the channel between Gibraltar and Africa was once dry land, and that the
low, neutral neck between Gibraltar and the Spanish hills behind it was
once ocean, and of course that these African animals, being over at Gibraltar
(after rock, perhaps--there is plenty there), got closed out when the great
change occurred. The hills in Africa, across the channel, are full of apes,
and there are now and always have been apes on the rock of Gibraltar--but
not elsewhere in Spain! The subject is an interesting one.

<P>There is an English garrison at Gibraltar of 6,000 or 7,000 men, and
so uniforms of flaming red are plenty; and red and blue, and undress costumes
of snowy white, and also the queer uniform of the bare-kneed Highlander;
and one sees soft-eyed Spanish girls from San Roque, and veiled Moorish
beauties (I suppose they are beauties) from Tarifa, and turbaned, sashed,
and trousered Moorish merchants from Fez, and long-robed, bare-legged,
ragged Muhammadan vagabonds from Tetu&aacute;n and Tangier, some brown,
some yellow and some as black as virgin ink--and Jews from all around,
in gabardine, skullcap, and slippers, just as they are in pictures and
theaters, and just as they were three thousand years ago, no doubt. You
can easily understand that a tribe (somehow our pilgrims suggest that expression,
because they march in a straggling procession through these foreign places
with such an Indian-like air of complacency and independence about them)
like ours, made up from fifteen or sixteen states of the Union, found enough
to stare at in this shifting panorama of fashion today.

<P>Speaking of our pilgrims reminds me that we have one or two people among
us who are sometimes an annoyance. However, I do not count the Oracle in
that list. I will explain that the Oracle is an innocent old ass who eats
for four and looks wiser than the whole Academy of France would have any
right to look, and never uses a one-syllable word when he can think of
a longer one, and never by any possible chance knows the meaning of any
long word he uses or ever gets it in the right place; yet he will serenely
venture an opinion on the most abstruse subject and back it up complacently
with quotations from authors who never existed, and finally when cornered
will slide to the other side of the question, say he has been there all
the time, and come back at you with your own spoken arguments, only with
the big words all tangled, and play them in your very teeth as original
with himself. He reads a chapter in the guidebooks, mixes the facts all
up, with his bad memory, and then goes off to inflict the whole mess on
somebody as wisdom which has been festering in his brain for years and
which he gathered in college from erudite authors who are dead now and
out of print. This morning at breakfast he pointed out of the window and
said:

<P>"Do you see that there hill out there on that African coast? It's one
of them Pillows of Herkewls, I should say--and there's the ultimate one
alongside of it."

<P>"The ultimate one--that is a good word--but the pillars are not both
on the same side of the strait." (I saw he had been deceived by a carelessly
written sentence in the guidebook.)

<P>"Well, it ain't for you to say, nor for me. Some authors states it that
way, and some states it different. Old Gibbons don't say nothing about
it--just shirks it complete--Gibbons always done that when he got stuck--but
there is Rolampton, what does <I>he</I> say? Why, be says that they was
both on the same side, and Trinculian, and Sobaster, and Syraccus, and
Langomarganb----"

<P>"Oh, that will do--that's enough. If you have got your hand in for inventing
authors and testimony, I have nothing more to say--let them <I>be </I>on
the same side."

<P>We don't mind the Oracle. We rather like him. We can tolerate the Oracle
very easily, but we have a poet and a good-natured enterprising idiot on
board, and they <I>do</I> distress the company. The one gives copies of
his verses to consuls, commanders, hotel keepers, Arabs, Dutch--to anybody,
in fact, who will submit to a grievous infliction most kindly meant. His
poetry is all very well on shipboard, notwithstanding when he wrote an
"Ode to the Ocean in a Storm" in one half hour, and an "Apostrophe to the
Rooster in the Waist of the Ship" in the next, the transition was considered
to be rather abrupt; but when he sends an invoice of rhymes to the Governor
of Fayal and another to the commander in chief and other dignitaries in
Gibraltar with the compliments of the Laureate of the Ship, it is not popular
with the passengers.

<P>The other personage I have mentioned is young and green, and not bright,
not learned, and not wise. He will be, though, someday if he recollects
the answers to all his questions. He is known about the ship as the "Interrogation
Point," and this by constant use has become shortened to "Interrogation."
He has distinguished himself twice already. In Fayal they pointed out a
hill and told him it was 800 feet high and 1,100 feet long. And they told
him there was a tunnel 2,000 feet long and 1,000 feet high running through
the hill, from end to end. He believed it. He repeated it to everybody,
discussed it, and read it from his notes. Finally, he took a useful hint
from this remark, which a thoughtful old pilgrim made:

<P>"Well, yes, it <I>is </I>a little remarkable--singular tunnel altogether--stands
up out of the top of the hill about two hundred feet, and one end of it
sticks out of the hill about nine hundred!"

<P>Here in Gibraltar he corners these educated British officers and badgers
them with braggadocio about America and the wonders she can perform! He
told one of them a couple of our gunboats could come here and knock Gibraltar
into the Mediterranean Sea!

<P>At this present moment half a dozen of us are taking a private pleasure
excursion of our own devising. We form rather more than half the list of
white passengers on board a small steamer bound for the venerable Moorish
town of Tangier, Africa. Nothing could be more absolutely certain than
that we are enjoying ourselves. One can not do otherwise who speeds over
these sparkling waters and breathes the soft atmosphere of this sunny land.
Care cannot assail us here. We are out of its jurisdiction.

<P>We even steamed recklessly by the frowning fortress of Malabat (a stronghold
of the Emperor of Morocco) without a twinge of fear. The whole garrison
turned out under arms and assumed a threatening attitude--yet still we
did not fear. The entire garrison marched and counter-marched within the
rampart, in full view--yet notwithstanding even this, we never flinched.

<P>I suppose we really do not know what fear is. I inquired the name of
the garrison of the fortress of Malabat, and they said it was Mehemet Ali
Ben Sancom. I said it would be a good idea to get some more garrisons to
help him; but they said no, he had nothing to do but hold the place, and
he was competent to do that, had done it two years already. That was evidence
which one could not well refute. There is nothing like reputation.

<P>Every now and then my glove purchase in Gibraltar last night intrudes
itself upon me. Dan and the ship's surgeon and I had been up to the great
square, listening to the music of the fine military bands and contemplating
English and Spanish female loveliness and fashion, and at nine o'clock
were on our way to the theater, when we met the General, the Judge, the
Commodore, the Colonel, and the Commissioner of the United States of America
to Europe, Asia, and Africa, who had been to the Club House to register
their several titles and impoverish the bill of fare; and they told us
to go over to the little variety store near the Hall of Justice and buy
some kid gloves. They said they were elegant and very moderate in price.
It seemed a stylish thing to go to the theater in kid gloves, and we acted
upon the hint. A very handsome young lady in the store offered me a pair
of blue gloves. I did not want blue, but she said they would look very
pretty on a hand like mine. The remark touched me tenderly. I glanced furtively
at my hand, and somehow it did seem rather a comely member. I tried a glove
on my left and blushed a little. Manifestly the size was too small for
me. But I felt gratified when she said:

<P>"Oh, it is just right!" Yet I knew it was no such thing.

<P>I tugged at it diligently, but it was discouraging work. She said:

<P>"Ah! I see <I>you </I>are accustomed to wearing kid gloves--but some
gentlemen are <I>so</I> awkward about putting them on."

<P>It was the last compliment I had expected. I only understand putting
on the buckskin article perfectly. I made another effort and tore the glove
from the base of the thumb into the palm of the hand--and tried to hide
the rent. She kept up her compliments, and I kept up my determination to
deserve them or die:

<P>"Ah, you have had experience! [A rip down the back of the hand.] They
are just right for you--your hand is very small--if they tear you need
not pay for them. [A rent across the middle.] I can always tell when a
gentleman understands putting on kid gloves. There is a grace about it
that only comes with long practice." The whole afterguard of the glove
"fetched away," as the sailors say, the fabric parted across the knuckles,
and nothing was left but a melancholy ruin.

<P>I was too much flattered to make an exposure and throw the merchandise
on the angel's hands. I was hot, vexed, confused, but still happy; but
I hated the other boys for taking such an absorbing interest in the proceedings.
I wished they were in Jericho. I felt exquisitely mean when I said cheerfully:

<P>"This one does very well; it fits elegantly. I like a glove that fits.
No, never mind, ma'am, never mind; I'll put the other on in the street.
It is warm here."

<P>It <I>was</I> warm. It was the warmest place I ever was in. I paid the
bill, and as I passed out with a fascinating bow I thought I detected a
light in the woman's eye that was gently ironical; and when I looked back
from the street, and she was laughing all to herself about something or
other, I said to myself with withering sarcasm, "Oh, certainly; <I>you</I>
know how to put on kid gloves, don't you? A self-complacent ass, ready
to be flattered out of your senses by every petticoat that chooses to take
the trouble to do it!"

<P>The silence of the boys annoyed me. Finally Dan said musingly:

<P>"Some gentlemen don't know how to put on kid gloves at all, but some
do."

<P>And the doctor said (to the moon, I thought):

<P>"But it is always easy to tell when a gentleman is used to putting on
kid gloves."

<P>Dan soliloquized after a pause:

<P>"Ah, yes; there is a grace about it that only comes with long, very
long practice."

<P>"Yes, indeed, I've noticed that when a man hauls on a kid glove like
he was dragging a cat out of an ash hole by the tail, <I>he</I> understands
putting on kid gloves; <I>he's </I>had ex----"

<P>"Boys, enough of a thing's enough! You think you are very smart, I suppose,
but I don't. And if you go and tell any of those old gossips in the ship
about this thing, I'll never forgive you for it; that's all."

<P>They let me alone then for the time being. We always let each other
alone in time to prevent ill feeling from spoiling a joke. But they had
bought gloves, too, as I did. We threw all the purchases away together
this morning. They were coarse, unsubstantial, freckled all over with broad
yellow splotches, and could neither stand wear nor public exhibition. We
had entertained an angel unawares, but we did not take her in. She did
that for us.

<P>Tangier! A tribe of stalwart Moors are wading into the sea to carry
us ashore on their backs from the small boats.
