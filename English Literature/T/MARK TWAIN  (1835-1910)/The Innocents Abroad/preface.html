PREFACE</H2>
This book is a record of a pleasure trip. If it were a record of a solemn
scientific expedition, it would have about it that gravity, that profundity,
and that impressive incomprehensibility which are so proper to works of
that kind, and withal so attractive. Yet notwithstanding it is only a record
of a picnic, it has a purpose, which is to suggest to the reader how <I>he
</I>would be likely to see Europe and the East if he looked at them with
his own eyes instead of the eyes of those who traveled in those countries
before him. I make small pretense of showing anyone how he <I>ought </I>to
look at objects of interest beyond the sea--other books do that, and therefore,
even if I were competent to do it, there is no need.

<P>I offer no apologies for any departures from the usual style of travel
writing that may be charged against me--for I think I have seen with impartial
eyes, and I am sure I have written at least honestly, whether wisely or
not.

<P>In this volume I have used portions of letters which I wrote for the
<I>Daily Alta California, </I>of San Francisco, the proprietors of that
journal having waived their rights and given me the necessary permission.
I have also inserted portions of several letters written for the New York
<I>Tribune </I>and the New York <I>Herald.</I>
