<P>We passed the Fourth of July on board the <I>Quaker City, </I>in midocean.
It was in all respects a characteristic Mediterranean day--faultlessly
beautiful. A cloudless sky; a refreshing summer wind; a radiant sunshine
that glinted cheerily from dancing wavelets instead of crested mountains
of water; a sea beneath us that was so wonderfully blue, so richly, brilliantly
blue, that it overcame the dullest sensibilities with the spell of its
fascination.

<P>They even have fine sunsets on the Mediterranean--a thing that is certainly
rare in most quarters of the globe. The evening we sailed away from Gibraltar,
that hard-featured rock was swimming in a creamy mist so rich, so soft,
so enchantingly vague and dreamy, that even the Oracle, that serene, that
inspired, that overpowering humbug, scorned the dinner gong and tarried
to worship!

<P>He said: "Well, that's gorgis, ain't it! They don't have none of them
things in our parts, <I>do</I> they? I consider that them effects is on
account of the superior refragability, as you may say, of the sun's diramic
combination with the lymphatic forces of the perihelion of Jubiter. What
should you think?"

<P>"Oh,<I> go </I>to bed!" Dan said that and went away.

<P>"Oh, yes, it's all very well to say go to bed when a man makes an argument
which another man can't answer. Dan don't never stand any chance in an
argument with me. And he knows it, too. What should you say, Jack?"

<P>"Now, Doctor, don't you come bothering around me with that dictionary
bosh. I don't do you any harm, do I? Then you let <I>me </I>alone."

<P>"He's gone, too. Well, them fellows have all tackled the old Oracle,
as they say, but the old man's most too many for 'em. Maybe the Poet Lariat
ain't satisfied with them deductions?"

<P>The poet replied with a barbarous rhyme and went below.

<P>"'Pears that <I>he</I> can't qualify, neither. Well, I didn't expect
nothing out of <I>him. </I>I never see one of them poets yet that knowed
anything. He'll go down now and grind out about four reams of the awfullest
slush about that old rock and give it to a consul, or a pilot, or a nigger,
or anybody he comes across first which he can impose on. Pity but somebody'd
take that poor old lunatic and dig all that poetry rubbage out of him.
Why can't a man put his intellect onto things that's some value? Gibbons,
and Hippocratus, and Sarcophagus, and all them old ancient philosophers
was down on poets--"

<P>"Doctor," I said, "you are going to invent authorities now and I'll
leave you, too. I always enjoy your conversation, notwithstanding the luxuriance
of your syllables, when the philosophy you offer rests on your own responsibility;
but when you begin to soar--when you begin to support it with the evidence
of authorities who are the creations of your own fancy--I lose confidence."

<P>That was the way to flatter the doctor. He considered it a sort of acknowledgment
on my part of a fear to argue with him. He was always persecuting the passengers
with abstruse propositions framed in language that no man could understand,
and they endured the exquisite torture a minute or two and then abandoned
the field. A triumph like this over half a dozen antagonists was sufficient
for one day; from that time forward he would patrol the decks beaming blandly
upon all comers, and so tranquilly, blissfully happy!

<P>But I digress. The thunder of our two brave cannon announced the Fourth
of July, at daylight, to all who were awake. But many of us got our information
at a later hour, from the almanac. All the flags were sent aloft except
half a dozen that were needed to decorate portions of the ship below, and
in a short time the vessel assumed a holiday appearance. During the morning,
meetings were held and all manner of committees set to work on the celebration
ceremonies. in the afternoon the ship's company assembled aft, on deck,
under the awnings; the flute, the asthmatic melodeon, and the consumptive
clarinet crippled "The Star-Spangled Banner," the choir chased it to cover,
and George came in with a peculiarly lacerating screech on the final note
and slaughtered it. Nobody mourned.

<P>We carried out the corpse on three cheers (that joke was not intentional
and I do not endorse it), and then the President, throned behind a cable
locker with a national flag spread over it, announced the "Reader," who
rose up and read that same old Declaration of Independence which we have
all listened to so often without paying any attention to what it said;
and after that the President piped the Orator of the Day to quarters and
he made that same old speech about our national greatness which we so religiously
believe and so fervently applaud. Now came the choir into court again,
with the complaining instruments, and assaulted "Hail Columbia"; and when
victory hung wavering in the scale, George returned with his dreadful wild-goose
stop turned on and the choir won, of course. A minister pronounced the
benediction, and the patriotic little gathering disbanded. The Fourth of
July was safe, as far as the Mediterranean was concerned.

<P>At dinner in the evening, a well-written original poem was recited with
spirit by one of the ship's captains, and thirteen regular toasts were
washed down with several baskets of champagne. The speeches were bad execrable
almost without exception. In fact, without <I>any</I> exception but one.
Captain Duncan made a good speech; he made the only good speech of the
evening. He said:

<P>"Ladies and gentlemen: May we all live to a green old age and be prosperous
and happy. Steward, bring up another basket of champagne."

<P>It was regarded as a very able effort.

<P>The festivities, so to speak, closed with another of those miraculous
balls on the promenade deck. We were not used to dancing on an even keel,
though, and it was only a questionable success. But take it all together,
it was a bright, cheerful, pleasant Fourth.

<P>Toward nightfall the next evening, we steamed into the great artificial
harbor of this noble city of Marseilles, and saw the dying sunlight gild
its clustering spires and ramparts, and flood its leagues of environing
verdure with a mellow radiance that touched with an added charm the white
villas that flecked the landscape far and near. [Copyright secured according

<P>There were no stages out, and we could not get on the pier from the
ship. It was annoying. We were full of enthusiasm--we wanted to see France!
Just at nightfall our party of three contracted with a waterman for the
privilege of using his boat as a bridge--its stern was at our companion
ladder and its bow touched the pier. We got in and the fellow backed out
into the harbor. I told him in French that all we wanted was to walk over
his thwarts and step ashore, and asked him what he went away out there
for. He said he could not understand me. I repeated. Still he could not
understand. He appeared to be very ignorant of French. The doctor tried
him, but he could not understand the doctor. I asked this boatman to explain
his conduct, which he did; and then I couldn't understand <I>him</I>. Dan
said:

<P>"Oh, go to the pier, you old fool--that's where we want to go!"

<P>We reasoned calmly with Dan that it was useless to speak to this foreigner
in English--that he had better let us conduct this business in the French
language and not let the stranger see how uncultivated he was.

<P>"Well, go on, go on," he said, "don't mind me. I don't wish to interfere.
Only, if you go on telling him in your kind of French, he never will find
out where we want to go to. That is what I think about it."

<P>We rebuked him severely for this remark and said we never knew an ignorant
person yet but was prejudiced. The Frenchman spoke again, and the doctor
said:

<P>"There now, Dan, he says he is going to <I>allez </I>to the <I>douain.
</I>Means he is going to the hotel. Oh, certainly--<I>we</I> don't know
the French language."

<P>This was a crusher, as Jack would say. It silenced further criticism
from the disaffected member. We coasted past the sharp bows of a navy of
great steamships and stopped at last at a government building on a stone
pier. It was easy to remember then that the <I>douain </I>was the customhouse
and not the hotel. We did not mention it, however. With winning French
politeness the officers merely opened and closed our satchels, declined
to examine our passports, and sent us on our way. We stopped at the first
caf&eacute; we came to and entered. An old woman seated us at a table and
waited for orders. The doctor said:

<P><I>"Avez-vous du vin?"</I>

<P>The dame looked perplexed. The doctor said again, with elaborate distinctness
of articulation:

<P><I>"Avez-vous du--vin!"</I>

<P>The dame looked more perplexed than before. I said:

<P>"Doctor, there is a flaw in your pronunciation somewhere. Let me try
her. <I>Madame, avez-vous du vin? </I>It isn't any use, Doctor--take the
witness."

<P><I>"Madame, avez-vous du vin--du fromage--pain--</I>pickled pigs' feet<I>--beurre--des
oeufs--du boeuf</I>--horseradish, sauerkraut, hog and hominy--anything,
anything in the world that can stay a Christian stomach!"

<P>She said:

<P>"Bless you, why didn't you speak English before? I don't know anything
about your plagued French!"

<P>The humiliating taunts of the disaffected member spoiled the supper,
and we dispatched it in angry silence and got away as soon as we could.
Here we were in beautiful France--in a vast stone house of quaint architecture--surrounded
by all manner of curiously worded French signs--stared at by strangely
habited, bearded French people--everything gradually and surely forcing
upon us the coveted consciousness that at last, and beyond all question,
we <I>were </I>in beautiful France and absorbing its nature to the forgetfulness
of everything else, and coming to feel the happy romance of the thing in
all its enchanting delightfulness--and to think of this skinny veteran
intruding with her vile English, at such a moment, to blow the fair vision
to the winds! It was exasperating.

<P>We set out to find the center of the city, inquiring the direction every
now. and then. We never did succeed in making anybody understand just exactly
what we wanted, and neither did we ever succeed in comprehending just exactly
what they said in reply, but then they always pointed--they always did
that--and we bowed politely and said, "<I>Merci, monsieur</I>," and so
it was a blighting triumph over the disaffected member anyway. He was restive
under these victories and often asked:

<P>"What did that pirate say?"

<P>"Why, he told us which way to go to find the Grand Casino."

<P>"Yes, but what did he <I>say</I>?"

<P>"Oh, it don't matter what he said--we understood him. These are educated
people not like that absurd boatman."

<P>"Well, I wish they were educated enough to tell a man a direction that
goes <I>some</I>where--for we've been going around in a circle for an hour.
I've passed this same old drugstore seven times."

<P>We said it was a low, disreputable falsehood (but we knew it was not).
It was plain that it would not do to pass that drugstore again, though--we
might go on asking directions, but we must cease from following finger-pointings
if we hoped to check the suspicions of the disaffected member.

<P>A long walk through smooth, asphaltum-paved streets bordered by blocks
of vast new mercantile houses of cream-colored stone every house and every
block precisely like all the other houses and all the other blocks for
a mile, and all brilliantly lighted--brought us at last to the principal
thoroughfare. On every hand were bright colors, flashing constellations
of gas burners, gaily dressed men and women thronging the sidewalks--hurry,
life, activity, cheerfulness, conversation, and laughter everywhere! We
found the Grand Hotel du Louvre et de la Paix, and wrote down who we were,
where we were born, what our occupations were, the place we came from last,
whether we were married or single, how we liked it, how old we were, where
we were bound for and when we expected to get there, and a great deal of
information of similar importance--all for the benefit of the landlord
and the secret police. We hired a guide and began the business of sightseeing
immediately. That first night on French soil was a stirring one. I cannot
think of half the places we went to or what we particularly saw; we had
no disposition to examine carefully into anything at all--we only wanted
to glance and go--to move, keep moving! The spirit of the country was upon
us. We sat down, finally, at a late hour, in the great Casino, and called
for unstinted champagne. It is so easy to be bloated aristocrats where
it costs nothing of consequence! There were about five hundred people in
that dazzling place, I suppose, though the walls being papered entirely
with mirrors, so to speak, one could not really tell but that there were
a hundred thousand. Young, daintily dressed exquisites and young, stylishly
dressed women, and also old gentlemen and old ladies, sat in couples and
groups about innumerable marble-topped tables and ate fancy suppers, drank
wine, and kept up a chattering din of conversation that was dazing to the
senses. There was a stage at the far end and a large orchestra; and every
now and then actors and actresses in preposterous comic dresses came out
and sang the most extravagantly funny songs, to judge by their absurd actions;
but that audience merely suspended its chatter, stared cynically, and never
once smiled, never once applauded! I had always thought that Frenchmen
were ready to laugh at anything.
