"Now, then, Maria," said Zerkow, his cracked, strained voice

just rising above a whisper, hitching his chair closer to

the table, "now, then, my girl, let's have it all over

again.  Tell us about the gold plate--the service.  Begin

with, 'There were over a hundred pieces and every one of

them gold.'"



"I don't know what you're talking about, Zerkow," answered

Maria.  "There never was no gold plate, no gold service.  I

guess you must have dreamed it."



Maria and the red-headed Polish Jew had been married about a

month after the McTeague's picnic which had ended in such

lamentable fashion.  Zerkow had taken Maria home to his

wretched hovel in the alley back of the flat, and the flat

had been obliged to get another maid of all work.  Time

passed, a month, six months, a whole year went by.  At

length Maria gave birth to a child, a wretched, sickly

child, with not even strength enough nor wits enough to

cry.  At the time of its birth Maria was out of her mind,

and continued in a state of dementia for nearly ten days. 

She recovered just in time to make the arrangements for the

baby's burial.  Neither Zerkow nor Maria was much affected

by either the birth or the death of this little child. 

Zerkow had welcomed it with pronounced disfavor, since it

had a mouth to be fed and wants to be provided for.  Maria

was out of her head so much of the time that she could

scarcely remember how it looked when alive.  The child was a

mere incident in their lives, a thing that had come

undesired and had gone unregretted.  It had not even a name;

a strange, hybrid little being, come and gone within a

fortnight's time, yet combining in its puny little body the

blood of the Hebrew, the Pole, and the Spaniard.



But the birth of this child had peculiar consequences. 

Maria came out of her dementia, and in a few days the

household settled itself again to its sordid regime and

Maria went about her duties as usual.  Then one evening,

about a week after the child's burial, Zerkow had asked

Maria to tell him the story of the famous service of gold

plate for the hundredth time.



Zerkow had come to believe in this story infallibly.  He was

immovably persuaded that at one time Maria or Maria's people

had possessed these hundred golden dishes.  In his perverted

mind the hallucination had developed still further.  Not

only had that service of gold plate once existed, but it

existed now, entire, intact; not a single burnished golden

piece of it was missing.  It was somewhere, somebody had it,

locked away in that leather trunk with its quilted lining

and round brass locks.  It was to be searched for and

secured, to be fought for, to be gained at all hazards. 

Maria must know where it was; by dint of questioning, Zerkow

would surely get the information from her. Some day, if only

he was persistent, he would hit upon the right combination

of questions, the right suggestion that would disentangle

Maria's confused recollections.  Maria would tell him where

the thing was kept, was concealed, was buried, and he would

go to that place and secure it, and all that wonderful gold

would be his forever and forever.  This service of plate had

come to be Zerkow's mania.



On this particular evening, about a week after the

child's burial, in the wretched back room of the Junk shop,

Zerkow had made Maria sit down to the table opposite him--

the whiskey bottle and the red glass tumbler with its broken

base between them--and had said:



"Now, then, Maria, tell us that story of the gold dishes

again."



Maria stared at him, an expression of perplexity coming into

her face.



"What gold dishes?" said she.



"The ones your people used to own in Central America.  Come

on, Maria, begin, begin."  The Jew craned himself forward,

his lean fingers clawing eagerly at his lips.



"What gold plate?" said Maria, frowning at him as she drank

her whiskey.  "What gold plate?  I don' know what you're

talking about, Zerkow."



Zerkow sat back in his chair, staring at her.



"Why, your people's gold dishes, what they used to eat off

of. You've told me about it a hundred times."



"You're crazy, Zerkow," said Maria.  "Push the bottle here,

will you?"



"Come, now," insisted Zerkow, sweating with desire, "come,

now, my girl, don't be a fool; let's have it, let's have it. 

Begin now, 'There were more'n a hundred pieces, and every

one of 'em gold.'  Oh, YOU know; come on, come on."



"I don't remember nothing of the kind," protested Maria,

reaching for the bottle.  Zerkow snatched it from her.



"You fool!" he wheezed, trying to raise his broken voice to

a shout.  "You fool!  Don't you dare try an' cheat ME, or

I'll DO for you.  You know about the gold plate, and you

know where it is."  Suddenly he pitched his voice at the

prolonged rasping shout with which he made his street cry. 

He rose to his feet, his long, prehensile fingers curled

into fists.  He was menacing, terrible in his rage.  He

leaned over Maria, his fists in her face.



"I believe you've got it!" he yelled.  "I believe you've got

it, an' are hiding it from me.  Where is it, where is it? Is

it here?" he rolled his eyes wildly about the room.

"Hey? hey?" he went on, shaking Maria by the shoulders. 

"Where is it?  Is it here?  Tell me where it is.  Tell me,

or I'll do for you!"



"It ain't here," cried Maria, wrenching from him.  "It ain't

anywhere.  What gold plate?  What are you talking about?  I

don't remember nothing about no gold plate at all."



No, Maria did not remember.  The trouble and turmoil of her

mind consequent upon the birth of her child seemed to have

readjusted her disordered ideas upon this point.  Her mania

had come to a crisis, which in subsiding had cleared her

brain of its one illusion.  She did not remember.  Or it was

possible that the gold plate she had once remembered had had

some foundation in fact, that her recital of its splendors

had been truth, sound and sane.  It was possible that now

her FORGETFULNESS of it was some form of brain trouble,

a relic of the dementia of childbirth.  At all events Maria

did not remember; the idea of the gold plate had passed

entirely out of her mind, and it was now Zerkow who labored

under its hallucination.  It was now Zerkow, the raker of

the city's muck heap, the searcher after gold, that saw that

wonderful service in the eye of his perverted mind.  It was

he who could now describe it in a language almost eloquent. 

Maria had been content merely to remember it; but Zerkow's

avarice goaded him to a belief that it was still in

existence, hid somewhere, perhaps in that very house, stowed

away there by Maria.  For it stood to reason, didn't it,

that Maria could not have described it with such wonderful

accuracy and such careful detail unless she had seen it

recently--the day before, perhaps, or that very day, or that

very hour, that very HOUR?



"Look out for yourself," he whispered, hoarsely, to his

wife. "Look out for yourself, my girl.  I'll hunt for it,

and hunt for it, and hunt for it, and some day I'll find it

--I will, you'll see--I'll find it, I'll find it; and if

I don't, I'll find a way that'll make you tell me where it

is.  I'll make you speak--believe me, I will, I will, my

girl--trust me for that."



And at night Maria would sometimes wake to find Zerkow

gone from the bed, and would see him burrowing into

some corner by the light of his dark-lantern and would hear

him mumbling to himself: "There were more'n a hundred

pieces, and every one of 'em gold--when the leather trunk

was opened it fair dazzled your eyes--why, just that punch-

bowl was worth a fortune, I guess; solid, solid, heavy,

rich, pure gold, nothun but gold, gold, heaps and heaps of

it--what a glory!  I'll find it yet, I'll find it.  It's

here somewheres, hid somewheres in this house."



At length his continued ill success began to exasperate him.

One day he took his whip from his junk wagon and thrashed

Maria with it, gasping the while, "Where is it, you beast? 

Where is it?  Tell me where it is; I'll make you speak."



"I don' know, I don' know," cried Maria, dodging his blows.

"I'd tell you, Zerkow, if I knew; but I don' know nothing

about it.  How can I tell you if I don' know?"



Then one evening matters reached a crisis.  Marcus Schouler

was in his room, the room in the flat just over McTeague's

"Parlors" which he had always occupied.  It was between

eleven and twelve o'clock.  The vast house was quiet; Polk

Street outside was very still, except for the occasional

whirr and trundle of a passing cable car and the persistent

calling of ducks and geese in the deserted market directly

opposite.  Marcus was in his shirt sleeves, perspiring and

swearing with exertion as he tried to get all his belongings

into an absurdly inadequate trunk.  The room was in great

confusion.  It looked as though Marcus was about to move. 

He stood in front of his trunk, his precious silk hat in its

hat-box in his hand.  He was raging at the perverseness of a

pair of boots that refused to fit in his trunk, no matter

how he arranged them.



"I've tried you SO, and I've tried you SO," he

exclaimed fiercely, between his teeth, "and you won't go."  

He began to swear horribly, grabbing at the boots with his

free hand. "Pretty soon I won't take you at all; I won't,

for a fact."



He was interrupted by a rush of feet upon the back stairs

and a clamorous pounding upon his door.  He opened it to let

in Maria Macapa, her hair dishevelled and her eyes starting

with terror.



"Oh, MISTER Schouler," she gasped, "lock the door

quick. Don't let him get me.  He's got a knife, and he says

sure he's going to do for me, if I don't tell him where it

is."



"Who has?  What has?  Where is what?" shouted Marcus,

flaming with excitement upon the instant.  He opened the

door and peered down the dark hall, both fists clenched,

ready to fight--he did not know whom, and he did not know

why.



"It's Zerkow," wailed Maria, pulling him back into the room

and bolting the door, "and he's got a knife as long as

THAT. Oh, my Lord, here he comes now!  Ain't that him?

Listen."



Zerkow was coming up the stairs, calling for Maria.



"Don't you let him get me, will you, Mister Schouler?"

gasped Maria.



"I'll break him in two," shouted Marcus, livid with rage.

"Think I'm afraid of his knife?"



"I know where you are," cried Zerkow, on the landing

outside. "You're in Schouler's room.  What are you doing in

Schouler's room at this time of night?  Come outa there; you

oughta be ashamed.  I'll do for you yet, my girl.  Come outa

there once, an' see if I don't."



"I'll do for you myself, you dirty Jew," shouted Marcus,

unbolting the door and running out into the hall.



"I want my wife," exclaimed the Jew, backing down the

stairs. "What's she mean by running away from me and going

into your room?"



"Look out, he's got a knife!" cried Maria through the crack

of the door.



"Ah, there you are.  Come outa that, and come back home,"

exclaimed Zerkow.



"Get outa here yourself," cried Marcus, advancing on him

angrily.  "Get outa here."



"Maria's gota come too."



"Get outa here," vociferated Marcus, "an' put up that knife. 

I see it; you needn't try an' hide it behind your leg.

Give it to me, anyhow," he shouted suddenly, and before

Zerkow was aware, Marcus had wrenched it away.  "Now, get

outa here."



Zerkow backed away, peering and peeping over Marcus's

shoulder.



"I want Maria."



"Get outa here.  Get along out, or I'll PUT you out."

The street door closed.  The Jew was gone.



"Huh!" snorted Marcus, swelling with arrogance.  "Huh!  

Think I'm afraid of his knife?  I ain't afraid of

ANYBODY," he shouted pointedly, for McTeague and his wife,

roused by the clamor, were peering over the banisters from

the landing above. "Not of anybody," repeated Marcus.



Maria came out into the hall.



"Is he gone?  Is he sure gone?"



"What was the trouble?" inquired Marcus, suddenly.



"I woke up about an hour ago," Maria explained, "and Zerkow

wasn't in bed; maybe he hadn't come to bed at all.  He was

down on his knees by the sink, and he'd pried up some boards

off the floor and was digging there.  He had his dark-

lantern.  He was digging with that knife, I guess, and all

the time he kept mumbling to himself, 'More'n a hundred

pieces, an' every one of 'em gold; more'n a hundred pieces,

an' every one of 'em gold.' Then, all of a sudden, he caught

sight of me.  I was sitting up in bed, and he jumped up and

came at me with his knife, an' he says, 'Where is it?  Where

is it?  I know you got it hid somewhere.  Where is it?  Tell

me or I'll knife you.'  I kind of fooled him and kept him

off till I got my wrapper on, an' then I run out.  I didn't

dare stay."



"Well, what did you tell him about your gold dishes for in

the first place?" cried Marcus.



"I never told him," protested Maria, with the greatest

energy. "I never told him; I never heard of any gold dishes. 

I don' know where he got the idea; he must be crazy."



By this time Trina and McTeague, Old Grannis, and little

Miss Baker--all the lodgers on the upper floors of the flat

--had gathered about Maria.  Trina and the dentist, who had

gone to bed, were partially dressed, and Trina's enormous

mane of black hair was hanging in two thick braids far down

her back.  But, late as it was, Old Grannis and the

retired dressmaker had still been up and about when Maria

had aroused them.



"Why, Maria," said Trina, "you always used to tell us about

your gold dishes.  You said your folks used to have them."



"Never, never, never!" exclaimed Maria, vehemently.  "You

folks must all be crazy.  I never HEARD of any gold

dishes."



"Well," spoke up Miss Baker, "you're a queer girl, Maria;

that's all I can say."  She left the group and returned to

her room. Old Grannis watched her go from the corner of his

eye, and in a few moments followed her, leaving the group as

unnoticed as he had joined it.  By degrees the flat quieted

down again.  Trina and McTeague returned to their rooms.



"I guess I'll go back now," said Maria.  "He's all right

now.  I ain't afraid of him so long as he ain't got his

knife."



"Well, say," Marcus called to her as she went down stairs,

"if he gets funny again, you just yell out; I'LL hear

you.  I won't let him hurt you."



Marcus went into his room again and resumed his wrangle with

the refractory boots.  His eye fell on Zerkow's knife, a

long, keen-bladed hunting-knife, with a buckhorn handle. 

"I'll take you along with me," he exclaimed, suddenly. 

"I'll just need you where I'm going."



Meanwhile, old Miss Baker was making tea to calm her nerves

after the excitement of Maria's incursion.  This evening she

went so far as to make tea for two, laying an extra place on

the other side of her little teatable, setting out a cup and

saucer and one of the Gorham silver spoons.  Close upon the

other side of the partition Old Grannis bound uncut numbers

of the "Nation."



"Do you know what I think, Mac?" said Trina, when the couple

had returned to their rooms.  "I think Marcus is going

away."



"What?  What?" muttered the dentist, very sleepy and stupid,

"what you saying?  What's that about Marcus?"



"I believe Marcus has been packing up, the last two or three

days.  I wonder if he's going away."



"Who's going away?" said McTeague, blinking at her.



"Oh, go to bed," said Trina, pushing him goodnaturedly.

"Mac, you're the stupidest man I ever knew."



But it was true.  Marcus was going away.  Trina received a

letter the next morning from her mother.  The carpet-

cleaning and upholstery business in which Mr. Sieppe had

involved himself was going from bad to worse.  Mr. Sieppe

had even been obliged to put a mortgage upon their house. 

Mrs. Sieppe didn't know what was to become of them all.  Her

husband had even begun to talk of emigrating to New Zealand. 

Meanwhile, she informed Trina that Mr. Sieppe had finally

come across a man with whom Marcus could "go in with on a

ranch," a cattle ranch in the southeastern portion of the

State.  Her ideas were vague upon the subject, but she knew

that Marcus was wildly enthusiastic at the prospect, and was

expected down before the end of the month.  In the meantime,

could Trina send them fifty dollars?



"Marcus IS going away, after all, Mac," said Trina to

her husband that day as he came out of his "Parlors" and sat

down to the lunch of sausages, mashed potatoes, and

chocolate in the sitting-room.



"Huh?" said the dentist, a little confused.  "Who's going

away? Schouler going away?  Why's Schouler going away?"



Trina explained.  "Oh!" growled McTeague, behind his thick

mustache, "he can go far before I'LL stop him."



"And, say, Mac," continued Trina, pouring the chocolate,

"what do you think?  Mamma wants me--wants us to send her

fifty dollars.  She says they're hard up."



"Well," said the dentist, after a moment, "well, I guess we

can send it, can't we?"



"Oh, that's easy to say," complained Trina, her little chin

in the air, her small pale lips pursed.  "I wonder if mamma

thinks we're millionaires?"



"Trina, you're getting to be regular stingy," muttered

McTeague.  "You're getting worse and worse every day."



"But fifty dollars is fifty dollars, Mac.  Just think how

long it takes you to earn fifty dollars.  Fifty dollars!  

That's two months of our interest."



"Well," said McTeague, easily, his mouth full of mashed

potato, "you got a lot saved up."



Upon every reference to that little hoard in the brass

match-safe and chamois-skin bag at the bottom of her trunk,

Trina bridled on the instant.



"Don't TALK that way, Mac.  'A lot of money.'  What do

you call a lot of money?  I don't believe I've got fifty

dollars saved."



"Hoh!" exclaimed McTeague.  "Hoh!  I guess you got nearer a

hundred AN' fifty.  That's what I guess YOU got."



"I've NOT, I've NOT," declared Trina, "and you know

I've not.  I wish mamma hadn't asked me for any money.  Why

can't she be a little more economical?  I manage all

right.  No, no, I can't possibly afford to send her fifty."



"Oh, pshaw!  What WILL you do, then?" grumbled her

husband.



"I'll send her twenty-five this month, and tell her I'll

send the rest as soon as I can afford it."



"Trina, you're a regular little miser," said McTeague.



"I don't care," answered Trina, beginning to laugh.  "I

guess I am, but I can't help it, and it's a good fault."



Trina put off sending this money for a couple of weeks, and

her mother made no mention of it in her next letter.  "Oh, I

guess if she wants it so bad," said Trina, "she'll speak

about it again."  So she again postponed the sending of it. 

Day by day she put it off.  When her mother asked her for it

a second time, it seemed harder than ever for Trina to part

with even half the sum requested.  She answered her mother,

telling her that they were very hard up themselves for that

month, but that she would send down the amount in a few

weeks.



"I'll tell you what we'll do, Mac," she said to her husband,

"you send half and I'll send half; we'll send twenty-five

dollars altogether.  Twelve and a half apiece.  That's an

idea. How will that do?"



"Sure, sure," McTeague had answered, giving her the money.

Trina sent McTeague's twelve dollars, but never sent the

twelve that was to be her share.  One day the dentist

happened to ask her about it.



"You sent that twenty-five to your mother, didn't you?" said

he.



"Oh, long ago," answered Trina, without thinking.



In fact, Trina never allowed herself to think very much of

this affair.  And, in fact, another matter soon came to

engross her attention.



One Sunday evening Trina and her husband were in their

sitting-room together.  It was dark, but the lamp had not

been lit.  McTeague had brought up some bottles of beer from

the "Wein Stube" on the ground floor, where the branch post-

office used to be.  But they had not opened the beer.  It

was a warm evening in summer.  Trina was sitting on

McTeague's lap in the bay window, and had looped back the

Nottingham curtains so the two could look out into the

darkened street and watch the moon coming up over the glass

roof of the huge public baths.  On occasions they sat like

this for an hour or so, "philandering," Trina cuddling

herself down upon McTeague's enormous body, rubbing her

cheek against the grain of his unshaven chin, kissing the

bald spot on the top of his head, or putting her fingers

into his ears and eyes.  At times, a brusque access of

passion would seize upon her, and, with a nervous little

sigh, she would clasp his thick red neck in both her small

arms and whisper in his ear:



"Do you love me, Mac, dear?  Love me BIG, BIG?

Sure, do you love me as much as you did when we were

married?"



Puzzled, McTeague would answer: "Well, you know it, don't

you, Trina?"



"But I want you to SAY so; say so always and always."



"Well, I do, of course I do."



"Say it, then."



"Well, then, I love you."



"But you don't say it of your own accord."



"Well, what--what--what--I don't understand," stammered the

dentist, bewildered.



There was a knock on the door.  Confused and

embarrassed, as if they were not married, Trina scrambled

off McTeague's lap, hastening to light the lamp, whispering,

"Put on your coat, Mac, and smooth your hair," and making

gestures for him to put the beer bottles out of sight.  She

opened the door and uttered an exclamation.



"Why, Cousin Mark!" she said.  McTeague glared at him,

struck speechless, confused beyond expression.  Marcus

Schouler, perfectly at his ease, stood in the doorway,

smiling with great affability.



"Say," he remarked, "can I come in?"



Taken all aback, Trina could only answer:



"Why--I suppose so.  Yes, of course--come in."



"Yes, yes, come in," exclaimed the dentist, suddenly,

speaking without thought.  "Have some beer?" he added,

struck with an idea.



"No, thanks, Doctor," said Marcus, pleasantly.



McTeague and Trina were puzzled.  What could it all mean? 

Did Marcus want to become reconciled to his enemy?  "I

know."  Trina said to herself.  "He's going away, and he

wants to borrow some money.  He won't get a penny, not a

penny."  She set her teeth together hard.



"Well," said Marcus, "how's business, Doctor?"



"Oh," said McTeague, uneasily, "oh, I don' know.  I guess--I

guess," he broke off in helpless embarrassment.  They had

all sat down by now.  Marcus continued, holding his hat and

his cane--the black wand of ebony with the gold top

presented to him by the "Improvement Club."



"Ah!" said he, wagging his head and looking about the

sitting-room, "you people have got the best fixed rooms in

the whole flat.  Yes, sir; you have, for a fact."  He

glanced from the lithograph framed in gilt and red plush--

the two little girls at their prayers--to the "I'm Grandpa"

and "I'm Grandma" pictures, noted the clean white matting

and the gay worsted tidies over the chair backs, and

appeared to contemplate in ecstasy the framed

photograph of McTeague and Trina in their wedding finery.



"Well, you two are pretty happy together, ain't you?" said

he, smiling good-humoredly.



"Oh, we don't complain," answered Trina.



"Plenty of money, lots to do, everything fine, hey?"



"We've got lots to do," returned Trina, thinking to head him

off, "but we've not got lots of money."



But evidently Marcus wanted no money.



"Well, Cousin Trina," he said, rubbing his knee, "I'm going

away."



"Yes, mamma wrote me; you're going on a ranch."



"I'm going in ranching with an English duck," corrected

Marcus. "Mr. Sieppe has fixed things.  We'll see if we can't

raise some cattle.  I know a lot about horses, and he's

ranched some before--this English duck.  And then I'm going

to keep my eye open for a political chance down there.  I

got some introductions from the President of the Improvement

Club.  I'll work things somehow, oh, sure."



"How long you going to be gone?" asked Trina.



Marcus stared.



"Why, I ain't EVER coming back," he vociferated.  "I'm

going to-morrow, and I'm going for good.  I come to say

good-by."



Marcus stayed for upwards of an hour that evening.  He

talked on easily and agreeably, addressing himself as much

to McTeague as to Trina.  At last he rose.



"Well, good-by, Doc."



"Good-by, Marcus," returned McTeague.  The two shook hands.



"Guess we won't ever see each other again," continued

Marcus. "But good luck to you, Doc.  Hope some day you'll

have the patients standing in line on the stairs."



"Huh!  I guess so, I guess so," said the dentist.



"Good-by, Cousin Trina."



"Good-by, Marcus," answered Trina.  "You be sure to

remember me to mamma, and papa, and everybody.  I'm

going to make two great big sets of Noah's ark animals for

the twins on their next birthday; August is too old for

toys.  But you can tell the twins that I'll make them some

great big animals.  Good-by, success to you, Marcus."



"Good-by, good-by.  Good luck to you both."



"Good-by, Cousin Mark."



"Good-by, Marcus."



He was gone.
