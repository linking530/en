"What nonsense!" answered Trina.



"Ach Gott!  What is ut?" cried Mrs. Sieppe,

misunderstanding, supposing a calamity.



"What--what--what," stammered the dentist, confused by the

lights, the crowded stairway, the medley of voices.  The

party reached the landing.  The others surrounded them. 

Marcus alone seemed to rise to the occasion.



"Le' me be the first to congratulate you," he cried,

catching Trina's hand.  Every one was talking at once.



"Miss Sieppe, Miss Sieppe, your ticket has won five thousand

dollars," cried Maria.  "Don't you remember the lottery

ticket I sold you in Doctor McTeague's office?"



"Trina!" almost screamed her mother.  "Five tausend thalers!

five tausend thalers!  If popper were only here!"



"What is it--what is it?" exclaimed McTeague, rolling his

eyes.



"What are you going to do with it, Trina?" inquired Marcus.



"You're a rich woman, my dear," said Miss Baker, her little

false curls quivering with excitement, "and I'm glad for

your sake.  Let me kiss you.  To think I was in the room

when you bought the ticket!"



"Oh, oh!" interrupted Trina, shaking her head, "there is a

mistake.  There must be.  Why--why should I win five

thousand dollars?  It's nonsense!"



"No mistake, no mistake," screamed Maria.  "Your number was

400,012.  Here it is in the paper this evening.  I remember

it well, because I keep an account."



"But I know you're wrong," answered Trina, beginning to

tremble in spite of herself.  "Why should I win?"



"Eh?  Why shouldn't you?" cried her mother.



In fact, why shouldn't she?  The idea suddenly occurred to

Trina.  After all, it was not a question of effort or merit

on her part.  Why should she suppose a mistake? What if it

were true, this wonderful fillip of fortune striking in

there like some chance-driven bolt?



"Oh, do you think so?" she gasped.



The stranger in the drab overcoat came forward.



"It's the agent," cried two or three voices, simultaneously.



"I guess you're one of the lucky ones, Miss Sieppe," he

said.  I suppose you have kept your ticket."



"Yes, yes; four three oughts twelve--I remember."



"That's right," admitted the other.  "Present your ticket at

the local branch office as soon as possible--the address is

printed on the back of the ticket--and you'll receive a

check on our bank for five thousand dollars.  Your number

will have to be verified on our official list, but there's

hardly a chance of a mistake.  I congratulate you."



All at once a great shrill of gladness surged up in Trina. 

She was to possess five thousand dollars.  She was carried

away with the joy of her good fortune, a natural,

spontaneous joy--the gaiety of a child with a new and

wonderful toy.



"Oh, I've won, I've won, I've won!" she cried, clapping her

hands.  "Mamma, think of it.  I've won five thousand

dollars, just by buying a ticket.  Mac, what do you say to

that?  I've got five thousand dollars.  August, do you hear

what's happened to sister?"



"Kiss your mommer, Trina," suddenly commanded Mrs. Sieppe.

"What efer will you do mit all dose money, eh, Trina?"



"Huh!" exclaimed Marcus.  "Get married on it for one thing.

Thereat they all shouted with laughter.  McTeague grinned,

and looked about sheepishly.  "Talk about luck," muttered

Marcus, shaking his head at the dentist; then suddenly he

added:



"Well, are we going to stay talking out here in the hall all

night?  Can't we all come into your 'Parlors,' Mac?"



"Sure, sure," exclaimed McTeague, hastily unlocking his

door.



"Efery botty gome," cried Mrs. Sieppe, genially. "Ain't ut

so, Doktor?"



"Everybody," repeated the dentist.  "There's--there's some

beer."



"We'll celebrate, by damn!" exclaimed Marcus.  "It ain't

every day you win five thousand dollars.  It's only Sundays

and legal holidays."  Again he set the company off into a

gale of laughter.  Anything was funny at a time like this. 

In some way every one of them felt elated.  The wheel of

fortune had come spinning close to them.  They were near to

this great sum of money.  It was as though they too had won.



"Here's right where I sat when I bought that ticket," cried

Trina, after they had come into the "Parlors," and Marcus

had lit the gas.  "Right here in this chair."  She sat down

in one of the rigid chairs under the steel engraving.

"And, Marcus, you sat here----"



"And I was just getting out of the operating chair,"

interposed Miss Baker.



"Yes, yes.  That's so; and you," continued Trina, pointing

to Maria, "came up and said, 'Buy a ticket in the lottery;

just a dollar.'  Oh, I remember it just as plain as though

it was yesterday, and I wasn't going to at first----"



"And don't you know I told Maria it was against the law?"



"Yes, I remember, and then I gave her a dollar and put the

ticket in my pocketbook.  It's in my pocketbook now at home

in the top drawer of my bureau--oh, suppose it should be

stolen now," she suddenly exclaimed.



"It's worth big money now," asserted Marcus.



"Five thousand dollars.  Who would have thought it?  It's

wonderful."  Everybody started and turned.  It was McTeague. 

He stood in the middle of the floor, wagging his huge head. 

He seemed to have just realized what had happened.



"Yes, sir, five thousand dollars!" exclaimed Marcus, with a

sudden unaccountable mirthlessness.  "Five thousand dollars!  

Do you get on to that?  Cousin Trina and you will be rich

people."



"At six per cent, that's twenty-five dollars a month,"

hazarded the agent.



"Think of it.  Think of it," muttered McTeague.  He went

aimlessly about the room, his eyes wide, his enormous hands

dangling.



"A cousin of mine won forty dollars once," observed Miss

Baker. "But he spent every cent of it buying more tickets,

and never won anything."



Then the reminiscences began.  Maria told about the butcher

on the next block who had won twenty dollars the last

drawing. Mrs. Sieppe knew a gasfitter in Oakland who had won

several times; once a hundred dollars.  Little Miss Baker

announced that she had always believed that lotteries were

wrong; but, just the same, five thousand was five thousand.



"It's all right when you win, ain't it, Miss Baker?"

observed Marcus, with a certain sarcasm.  What was the

matter with Marcus? At moments he seemed singularly out of

temper.



But the agent was full of stories.  He told his experiences,

the legends and myths that had grown up around the history

of the lottery; he told of the poor newsboy with a dying

mother to support who had drawn a prize of fifteen thousand;

of the man who was driven to suicide through want, but who

held (had he but known it) the number that two days after

his death drew the capital prize of thirty thousand dollars;

of the little milliner who for ten years had played the

lottery without success, and who had one day declared that

she would buy but one more ticket and then give up trying,

and of how this last ticket had brought her a fortune upon

which she could retire; of tickets that had been lost or

destroyed, and whose numbers had won fabulous sums at the

drawing; of criminals, driven to vice by poverty, and who

had reformed after winning competencies; of gamblers who

played the lottery as they would play a faro bank, turning

in their winnings again as soon as made, buying thousands of

tickets all over the country; of superstitions as to

terminal and initial numbers, and as to lucky days of

purchase; of marvellous coincidences--three capital prizes

drawn consecutively by the same town; a ticket bought by a

millionaire and given to his boot-black, who won a thousand

dollars upon it; the same number winning the same amount an

indefinite number of times; and so on to infinity. 

Invariably it was the needy who won, the destitute and

starving woke to wealth and plenty, the virtuous toiler

suddenly found his reward in a ticket bought at a hazard;

the lottery was a great charity, the friend of the people, a

vast beneficent machine that recognized neither rank nor

wealth nor station.



The company began to be very gay.  Chairs and tables were

brought in from the adjoining rooms, and Maria was sent out

for more beer and tamales, and also commissioned to buy a

bottle of wine and some cake for Miss Baker, who abhorred

beer.



The "Dental Parlors" were in great confusion.  Empty beer

bottles stood on the movable rack where the instruments were

kept; plates and napkins were upon the seat of the

operating chair and upon the stand of shelves in the corner,

side by side with the concertina and the volumes of "Allen's

Practical Dentist."  The canary woke and chittered crossly,

his feathers puffed out; the husks of tamales littered the

floor; the stone pug dog sitting before the little stove

stared at the unusual scene, his glass eyes starting from

their sockets.



They drank and feasted in impromptu fashion.  Marcus

Schouler assumed the office of master of ceremonies; he was

in a lather of excitement, rushing about here and there,

opening beer bottles, serving the tamales, slapping McTeague

upon the back, laughing and joking continually.  He made

McTeague sit at the head of the table, with Trina at his

right and the agent at his left; he--when he sat down at

all--occupied the foot, Maria Macapa at his left, while next

to her was Mrs. Sieppe, opposite Miss Baker.  Owgooste had

been put to bed upon the bed-lounge.



"Where's Old Grannis?" suddenly exclaimed Marcus.  Sure

enough, where had the old Englishman gone?  He had been

there at first.



"I called him down with everybody else," cried Maria Macapa,

"as soon as I saw in the paper that Miss Sieppe had won.  We

all came down to Mr. Schouler's room and waited for you to

come home.  I think he must have gone back to his room.  

I'll bet you'll find him sewing up his books."



"No, no," observed Miss Baker, "not at this hour."



Evidently the timid old gentleman had taken advantage of the

confusion to slip unobtrusively away.



"I'll go bring him down," shouted Marcus; "he's got to join

us."



Miss Baker was in great agitation.



"I--I hardly think you'd better," she murmured; "he--he--I

don't think he drinks beer."



"He takes his amusement in sewin' up books," cried Maria.



Marcus brought him down, nevertheless, having found him just

preparing for bed.



"I--I must apologize," stammered Old Grannis, as he stood

in the doorway.  "I had not quite expected--I--find--

find myself a little unprepared."  He was without collar and

cravat, owing to Marcus Schouler's precipitate haste.  He

was annoyed beyond words that Miss Baker saw him thus. 

Could anything be more embarrassing?



Old Grannis was introduced to Mrs. Sieppe and to Trina as

Marcus's employer.  They shook hands solemnly.



"I don't believe that he an' Miss Baker have ever been

introduced," cried Maria Macapa, shrilly, "an' they've been

livin' side by side for years."



The two old people were speechless, avoiding each other's

gaze. It had come at last; they were to know each other, to

talk together, to touch each other's hands.



Marcus brought Old Grannis around the table to little Miss

Baker, dragging him by the coat sleeve, exclaiming: "Well, I

thought you two people knew each other long ago.  Miss

Baker, this is Mr. Grannis; Mr. Grannis, this is Miss

Baker."  Neither spoke.  Like two little children they faced

each other, awkward, constrained, tongue-tied with

embarrassment.  Then Miss Baker put out her hand shyly.  Old

Grannis touched it for an instant and let it fall.



"Now you know each other," cried Marcus, "and it's about

time."  For the first time their eyes met; Old Grannis

trembled a little, putting his hand uncertainly to his chin. 

Miss Baker flushed ever so slightly, but Maria Macapa passed

suddenly between them, carrying a half empty beer bottle. 

The two old people fell back from one another, Miss Baker

resuming her seat.



"Here's a place for you over here, Mr. Grannis," cried

Marcus, making room for him at his side.  Old Grannis

slipped into the chair, withdrawing at once from the

company's notice.  He stared fixedly at his plate and did

not speak again.  Old Miss Baker began to talk volubly

across the table to Mrs. Sieppe about hot-house flowers and

medicated flannels.



It was in the midst of this little impromptu supper that the

engagement of Trina and the dentist was announced.  In a

pause in the chatter of conversation Mrs. Sieppe leaned

forward and, speaking to the agent, said:



"Vell, you know also my daughter Trina get married bretty

soon. She and der dentist, Doktor McTeague, eh, yes?"



There was a general exclamation.



"I thought so all along," cried Miss Baker, excitedly.  "The

first time I saw them together I said, 'What a pair!'"



"Delightful!" exclaimed the agent, "to be married and win a

snug little fortune at the same time."



"So--So," murmured Old Grannis, nodding at his plate.



"Good luck to you," cried Maria.



"He's lucky enough already," growled Marcus under his

breath, relapsing for a moment into one of those strange

moods of sullenness which had marked him throughout the

evening.



Trina flushed crimson, drawing shyly nearer her mother.

McTeague grinned from ear to ear, looking around from one to

another, exclaiming "Huh!  Huh!"



But the agent rose to his feet, a newly filled beer glass in

his hand.  He was a man of the world, this agent.  He knew

life.  He was suave and easy.  A diamond was on his little

finger.



"Ladies and gentlemen," he began.  There was an instant

silence. "This is indeed a happy occasion.  I--I am glad to

be here to-night; to be a witness to such good fortune; to

partake in these--in this celebration. Why, I feel almost as

glad as if I had held four three oughts twelve myself; as if

the five thousand were mine instead of belonging to our

charming hostess. The good wishes of my humble self go out

to Miss Sieppe in this moment of her good fortune, and I

think--in fact, I am sure I can speak for the great

institution, the great company I represent.  The company

congratulates Miss Sieppe. We--they--ah--They wish her every

happiness her new fortune can procure her.  It has been my

duty, my--ah--cheerful duty to call upon the winners of

large prizes and to offer the felicitation of the company. 

I have, in my experience, called upon many such; but never

have I seen fortune so happily bestowed as in this case. 

The company have dowered the prospective bride.  I am

sure I but echo the sentiments of this assembly when I wish

all joy and happiness to this happy pair, happy in the

possession of a snug little fortune, and happy--happy in--"

he finished with a sudden inspiration--"in the possession of

each other; I drink to the health, wealth, and happiness of

the future bride and groom.  Let us drink standing up."  

They drank with enthusiasm.  Marcus was carried away with

the excitement of the moment.



"Outa sight, outa sight," he vociferated, clapping his

hands. "Very well said.  To the health of the bride. 

McTeague, McTeague, speech, speech!"



In an instant the whole table was clamoring for the dentist

to speak.  McTeague was terrified; he gripped the table with

both hands, looking wildly about him.



"Speech, speech!" shouted Marcus, running around the table

and endeavoring to drag McTeague up.



"No--no--no," muttered the other.  "No speech."  The company

rattled upon the table with their beer glasses, insisting

upon a speech.  McTeague settled obstinately into his chair,

very red in the face, shaking his head energetically.



"Ah, go on!" he exclaimed; "no speech."



"Ah, get up and say somethun, anyhow," persisted Marcus;

"you ought to do it.  It's the proper caper."



McTeague heaved himself up; there was a burst of applause;

he looked slowly about him, then suddenly sat down again,

shaking his head hopelessly.



"Oh, go on, Mac," cried Trina.



"Get up, say somethun, anyhow, cried Marcus, tugging at his

arm; "you GOT to."



Once more McTeague rose to his feet.



"Huh!" he exclaimed, looking steadily at the table. Then he

began:



"I don' know what to say--I--I--I ain't never made a speech

before; I--I ain't never made a speech before.  But I'm glad

Trina's won the prize--"



"Yes, I'll bet you are," muttered Marcus.



"I--I--I'm glad Trina's won, and I--I want to--I want

to--I want to--want to say that--you're--all--welcome, an'

drink hearty, an' I'm much obliged to the agent.  Trina and

I are goin' to be married, an' I'm glad everybody's here to-

night, an' you're--all--welcome, an' drink hearty, an' I

hope you'll come again, an' you're always welcome--an'--I--

an'--an'--That's--about--all--I--gotta say."  He sat down,

wiping his forehead, amidst tremendous applause.



Soon after that the company pushed back from the table and

relaxed into couples and groups.  The men, with the

exception of Old Grannis, began to smoke, the smell of their

tobacco mingling with the odors of ether, creosote, and

stale bedding, which pervaded the "Parlors."  Soon the

windows had to be lowered from the top.  Mrs.  Sieppe and

old Miss Baker sat together in the bay window exchanging

confidences.  Miss Baker had turned back the overskirt of

her dress; a plate of cake was in her lap; from time to time

she sipped her wine with the delicacy of a white cat.  The

two women were much interested in each other.  Miss Baker

told Mrs. Sieppe all about Old Grannis, not forgetting the

fiction of the title and the unjust stepfather.



"He's quite a personage really," said Miss Baker.



Mrs.  Sieppe led the conversation around to her children. 

"Ach, Trina is sudge a goote girl," she said; "always gay,

yes, und sing from morgen to night.  Und Owgooste, he is soh

smart also, yes, eh?  He has der genius for machines, always

making somethun mit wheels und sbrings."



"Ah, if--if--I had children," murmured the little old maid a

trifle wistfully, "one would have been a sailor; he would

have begun as a midshipman on my brother's ship; in time he

would have been an officer.  The other would have been a

landscape gardener."



"Oh, Mac!" exclaimed Trina, looking up into the dentist's

face, "think of all this money coming to us just at this

very moment. Isn't it wonderful?  Don't it kind of scare

you?"



"Wonderful, wonderful!" muttered McTeague, shaking his head.

"Let's buy a lot of tickets," he added, struck with an idea.



"Now, that's how you can always tell a good cigar,"

observed the agent to Marcus as the two sat smoking at the

end of the table. "The light end should be rolled to a

point."



"Ah, the Chinese cigar-makers," cried Marcus, in a passion,

brandishing his fist.  "It's them as is ruining the cause of

white labor.  They are, they are for a FACT.  Ah, the

rat-eaters!  Ah, the white-livered curs!"



Over in the corner, by the stand of shelves, Old Grannis was

listening to Maria Macapa.  The Mexican woman had been

violently stirred over Trina's sudden wealth; Maria's mind

had gone back to her younger days. She leaned forward, her

elbows on her knees, her chin in her hands, her eyes wide

and fixed.  Old Grannis listened to her attentively.



"There wa'n't a piece that was so much as scratched," Maria

was saying.  "Every piece was just like a mirror, smooth and

bright; oh, bright as a little sun.  Such a service as that

was--platters and soup tureens and an immense big punch-

bowl. Five thousand dollars, what does that amount to?  Why,

that punch-bowl alone was worth a fortune."



"What a wonderful story!" exclaimed Old Grannis, never for

an instant doubting its truth.  "And it's all lost now, you

say?"



"Lost, lost," repeated Maria.



"Tut, tut!  What a pity!  What a pity!"



Suddenly the agent rose and broke out with:



"Well, I must be going, if I'm to get any car."



He shook hands with everybody, offered a parting cigar to

Marcus, congratulated McTeague and Trina a last time, and

bowed himself out.



"What an elegant gentleman," commented Miss Baker.



"Ah," said Marcus, nodding his head, "there's a man of the

world for you.  Right on to himself, by damn!"



The company broke up.



"Come along, Mac," cried Marcus; "we're to sleep with the

dogs to-night, you know."



The two friends said "Good-night" all around and departed

for the little dog hospital.



Old Grannis hurried to his room furtively, terrified

lest he should again be brought face to face with Miss

Baker.  He bolted himself in and listened until he heard her

foot in the hall and the soft closing of her door.  She was

there close beside him; as one might say, in the same room;

for he, too, had made the discovery as to the similarity of

the wallpaper.  At long intervals he could hear a faint

rustling as she moved about. What an evening that had been

for him!  He had met her, had spoken to her, had touched her

hand; he was in a tremor of excitement.  In a like manner

the little old dressmaker listened and quivered.  HE was

there in that same room which they shared in common,

separated only by the thinnest board partition.  He was

thinking of her, she was almost sure of it. They were

strangers no longer; they were acquaintances, friends. What

an event that evening had been in their lives!



Late as it was, Miss Baker brewed a cup of tea and sat down

in her rocking chair close to the partition; she rocked

gently, sipping her tea, calming herself after the emotions

of that wonderful evening.



Old Grannis heard the clinking of the tea things and smelt

the faint odor of the tea.  It seemed to him a signal, an

invitation.  He drew his chair close to his side of the

partition, before his work-table.  A pile of half-bound

"Nations" was in the little binding apparatus; he threaded

his huge upholsterer's needle with stout twine and set to

work.



It was their tete-a-tete.  Instinctively they felt each

other's presence, felt each other's thought coming to them

through the thin partition.  It was charming; they were

perfectly happy.  There in the stillness that settled over

the flat in the half hour after midnight the two old people

"kept company," enjoying after their fashion their little

romance that had come so late into the lives of each.



On the way to her room in the garret Maria Macapa paused

under the single gas-jet that burned at the top of the well

of the staircase; she assured herself that she was alone,

and then drew from her pocket one of McTeague's "tapes" of

non-cohesive gold. It was the most valuable steal she

had ever yet made in the dentist's "Parlors."  She told

herself that it was worth at least a couple of dollars. 

Suddenly an idea occurred to her, and she went hastily to a

window at the end of the hall, and, shading her face with

both hands, looked down into the little alley just back of

the flat.  On some nights Zerkow, the red-headed Polish Jew,

sat up late, taking account of the week's ragpicking.  There

was a dim light in his window now.



Maria went to her room, threw a shawl around her head, and

descended into the little back yard of the flat by the back

stairs.  As she let herself out of the back gate into the

alley, Alexander, Marcus's Irish setter, woke suddenly with

a gruff bark.  The collie who lived on the other side of the

fence, in the back yard of the branch post-office, answered

with a snarl. Then in an instant the endless feud between

the two dogs was resumed.  They dragged their respective

kennels to the fence, and through the cracks raged at each

other in a frenzy of hate; their teeth snapped and gleamed;

the hackles on their backs rose and stiffened.  Their

hideous clamor could have been heard for blocks around. What

a massacre should the two ever meet!



Meanwhile, Maria was knocking at Zerkow's miserable hovel.



"Who is it?  Who is it?" cried the rag-picker from within,

in his hoarse voice, that was half whisper, starting

nervously, and sweeping a handful of silver into his drawer.



"It's me, Maria Macapa;" then in a lower voice, and as if

speaking to herself, "had a flying squirrel an' let him go."



"Ah, Maria," cried Zerkow, obsequiously opening the door. 

"Come in, come in, my girl; you're always welcome, even as

late as this.  No junk, hey?  But you're welcome for all

that.  You'll have a drink, won't you?"  He led her into his

back room and got down the whiskey bottle and the broken red

tumbler.



After the two had drunk together Maria produced the gold

"tape."  Zerkow's eyes glittered on the instant. The sight

of gold invariably sent a qualm all through him; try as he

would, he could not repress it.  His fingers trembled and

clawed at his mouth; his breath grew short.



"Ah, ah, ah!" he exclaimed, "give it here, give it here;

give it to me, Maria.  That's a good girl, come give it to

me."



They haggled as usual over the price, but to-night Maria was

too excited over other matters to spend much time in

bickering over a few cents.



"Look here, Zerkow," she said as soon as the transfer was

made, "I got something to tell you.  A little while ago I

sold a lottery ticket to a girl at the flat; the drawing was

in this evening's papers.  How much do you suppose that girl

has won?"



"I don't know.  How much?  How much?"



"Five thousand dollars."



It was as though a knife had been run through the Jew; a

spasm of an almost physical pain twisted his face--his

entire body. He raised his clenched fists into the air, his

eyes shut, his teeth gnawing his lip.



"Five thousand dollars," he whispered; "five thousand

dollars. For what? For nothing, for simply buying a ticket;

and I have worked so hard for it, so hard, so hard.  Five

thousand dollars, five thousand dollars.  Oh, why couldn't

it have come to me?" he cried, his voice choking, the tears

starting to his eyes; "why couldn't it have come to me?  To

come so close, so close, and yet to miss me--me who have

worked for it, fought for it, starved for it, am dying for

it every day.  Think of it, Maria, five thousand dollars,

all bright, heavy pieces----"



"Bright as a sunset," interrupted Maria, her chin propped on

her hands.  "Such a glory, and heavy.  Yes, every piece was

heavy, and it was all you could do to lift the punch-bowl. 

Why, that punch-bowl was worth a fortune alone----"



"And it rang when you hit it with your knuckles, didn't it?"

prompted Zerkow, eagerly, his lips trembling, his fingers

hooking themselves into claws.



"Sweeter'n any church bell," continued Maria.



"Go on, go on, go on," cried Zerkow, drawing his chair

closer, and shutting his eyes in ecstasy.



"There were more than a hundred pieces, and every one of

them gold----"



"Ah, every one of them gold."



"You should have seen the sight when the leather trunk was

opened.  There wa'n't a piece that was so much as scratched;

every one was like a mirror, smooth and bright, polished so

that it looked black--you know how I mean."



"Oh, I know, I know," cried Zerkow, moistening his lips.



Then he plied her with questions--questions that covered

every detail of that service of plate.  It was soft, wasn't

it?  You could bite into a plate and leave a dent?  The

handles of the knives, now, were they gold, too?  All the

knife was made from one piece of gold, was it?  And the

forks the same?  The interior of the trunk was quilted, of

course?  Did Maria ever polish the plates herself?  When the

company ate off this service, it must have made a fine

noise--these gold knives and forks clinking together upon

these gold plates.



"Now, let's have it all over again, Maria," pleaded Zerkow.

"Begin now with 'There were more than a hundred pieces, and

every one of them gold.'  Go on, begin, begin, begin!"



The red-headed Pole was in a fever of excitement. Maria's

recital had become a veritable mania with him.  As he

listened, with closed eyes and trembling lips, he fancied he

could see that wonderful plate before him, there on the

table, under his eyes, under his hand, ponderous, massive,

gleaming.  He tormented Maria into a second repetition of

the story--into a third.  The more his mind dwelt upon it,

the sharper grew his desire.  Then, with Maria's refusal to

continue the tale, came the reaction.  Zerkow awoke as from

some ravishing dream.  The plate was gone, was irretrievably

lost.  There was nothing in that miserable room but grimy

rags and rust-corroded iron.  What torment! what agony! to

be so near--so near, to see it in one's distorted fancy as

plain as in a mirror.  To know every individual piece as an

old friend; to feel its weight; to be dazzled by its

glitter; to call it one's own, own; to have it to oneself,

hugged to the breast; and then to start, to wake, to come

down to the horrible reality.



"And you, YOU had it once," gasped Zerkow, clawing at

her arm; "you had it once, all your own.  Think of it,

and now it's gone."



"Gone for good and all."



"Perhaps it's buried near your old place somewhere."



"It's gone--gone--gone," chanted Maria in a monotone.



Zerkow dug his nails into his scalp, tearing at his red

hair.



"Yes, yes, it's gone, it's gone--lost forever!  Lost

forever!"



Marcus and the dentist walked up the silent street and

reached the little dog hospital.  They had hardly spoken on

the way. McTeague's brain was in a whirl; speech failed him. 

He was busy thinking of the great thing that had happened

that night, and was trying to realize what its effect would

be upon his life--his life and Trina's.  As soon as they had

found themselves in the street, Marcus had relapsed at once

to a sullen silence, which McTeague was too abstracted to

notice.



They entered the tiny office of the hospital with its red

carpet, its gas stove, and its colored prints of famous dogs

hanging against the walls.  In one corner stood the iron bed

which they were to occupy.



"You go on an' get to bed, Mac," observed Marcus. "I'll take

a look at the dogs before I turn in."



He went outside and passed along into the yard, that was

bounded on three sides by pens where the dogs were kept.  A

bull terrier dying of gastritis recognized him and began to

whimper feebly.



Marcus paid no attention to the dogs.  For the first time

that evening he was alone and could give vent to his

thoughts.  He took a couple of turns up and down the yard,

then suddenly in a low voice exclaimed:



"You fool, you fool, Marcus Schouler!  If you'd kept Trina

you'd have had that money.  You might have had it yourself. 

You've thrown away your chance in life--to give up the girl,

yes--but this," he stamped his foot with rage--"to throw

five thousand dollars out of the window--to stuff it into

the pockets of someone else, when it might have been

yours, when you might have had Trina AND the money--and

all for what? Because we were pals . Oh, 'pals' is all

right--but five thousand dollars--to have played it right

into his hands--God DAMN the luck!"
