A week passed, then a fortnight, then a month.  It was a

month of the greatest anxiety and unquietude for Trina. 

McTeague was out of a job, could find nothing to do; and

Trina, who saw the impossibility of saving as much money as

usual out of her earnings under the present conditions, was

on the lookout for cheaper quarters.  In spite of his

outcries and sulky resistance Trina had induced her husband

to consent to such a move, bewildering him with a torrent of

phrases and marvellous columns of figures by which she

proved conclusively that they were in a condition but one

remove from downright destitution.



The dentist continued idle.  Since his ill success with the

manufacturers of surgical instruments he had made but two

attempts to secure a job.  Trina had gone to see Uncle

Oelbermann and had obtained for McTeague a position in the

shipping department of the wholesale toy store.  However, it

was a position that involved a certain amount of ciphering,

and McTeague had been obliged to throw it up in two days.



Then for a time they had entertained a wild idea that a

place on the police force could be secured for McTeague.  He

could pass the physical examination with flying colors, and

Ryer, who had become the secretary of the Polk Street

Improvement Club, promised the requisite political "pull."  

If McTeague had shown a certain energy in the matter the

attempt might have been successful; but he was too

stupid, or of late had become too listless to exert himself

greatly, and the affair resulted only in a violent quarrel

with Ryer.



McTeague had lost his ambition.  He did not care to better

his situation.  All he wanted was a warm place to sleep and

three good meals a day.  At the first--at the very first--he

had chafed at his idleness and had spent the days with his

wife in their one narrow room, walking back and forth with

the restlessness of a caged brute, or sitting motionless for

hours, watching Trina at her work, feeling a dull glow of

shame at the idea that she was supporting him.  This feeling

had worn off quickly, however.  Trina's work was only hard

when she chose to make it so, and as a rule she supported

their misfortunes with a silent fortitude.



Then, wearied at his inaction and feeling the need of

movement and exercise, McTeague would light his pipe and

take a turn upon the great avenue one block above Polk

Street.  A gang of laborers were digging the foundations for

a large brownstone house, and McTeague found interest and

amusement in leaning over the barrier that surrounded the

excavations and watching the progress of the work.  He came

to see it every afternoon; by and by he even got to know the

foreman who superintended the job, and the two had long

talks together.  Then McTeague would return to Polk Street

and find Heise in the back room of the harness shop, and

occasionally the day ended with some half dozen drinks of

whiskey at Joe Frenna's saloon.



It was curious to note the effect of the alcohol upon the

dentist.  It did not make him drunk, it made him vicious. 

So far from being stupefied, he became, after the fourth

glass, active, alert, quick-witted, even talkative; a

certain wickedness stirred in him then; he was intractable,

mean; and when he had drunk a little more heavily than

usual, he found a certain pleasure in annoying and

exasperating Trina, even in abusing and hurting her.



It had begun on the evening of Thanksgiving Day, when Heise

had taken McTeague out to dinner with him.  The dentist on

this occasion had drunk very freely.  He and Heise had

returned to Polk Street towards ten o'clock, and Heise

at once suggested a couple of drinks at Frenna's.



"All right, all right," said McTeague.  "Drinks, that's the

word.  I'll go home and get some money and meet you at

Joe's."



Trina was awakened by her husband pinching her arm.



"Oh, Mac," she cried, jumping up in bed with a little

scream, "how you hurt!  Oh, that hurt me dreadfully."



"Give me a little money," answered the dentist, grinning,

and pinching her again.



"I haven't a cent.  There's not a--oh, MAC, will you

stop? I won't have you pinch me that way."



"Hurry up," answered her husband, calmly, nipping the flesh

of her shoulder between his thumb and finger.  "Heise's

waiting for me."  Trina wrenched from him with a sharp

intake of breath, frowning with pain, and caressing her

shoulder.



"Mac, you've no idea how that hurts.  Mac, STOP!"



"Give me some money, then."



In the end Trina had to comply.  She gave him half a dollar

from her dress pocket, protesting that it was the only piece

of money she had.



"One more, just for luck," said McTeague, pinching her

again; "and another."



"How can you--how CAN you hurt a woman so!" exclaimed

Trina, beginning to cry with the pain.



"Ah, now, CRY," retorted the dentist.  "That's right,

CRY.  I never saw such a little fool."  He went out,

slamming the door in disgust.



But McTeague never became a drunkard in the generally

received sense of the term.  He did not drink to excess more

than two or three times in a month, and never upon any

occasion did he become maudlin or staggering.  Perhaps his

nerves were naturally too dull to admit of any excitation;

perhaps he did not really care for the whiskey, and only

drank because Heise and the other men at Frenna's did. 

Trina could often reproach him with drinking too much; she

never could say that he was drunk.  The alcohol had its

effect for all that.  It roused the man, or rather the brute

in the man, and now not only roused it, but goaded it to

evil.  McTeague's nature changed.  It was not only the

alcohol, it was idleness and a general throwing off of the

good influence his wife had had over him in the days of

their prosperity.  McTeague disliked Trina.  She was a

perpetual irritation to him.  She annoyed him because she

was so small, so prettily made, so invariably correct and

precise.  Her avarice incessantly harassed him.  Her

industry was a constant reproach to him.  She seemed to

flaunt her work defiantly in his face. It was the red flag

in the eyes of the bull.  One time when he had just come

back from Frenna's and had been sitting in the chair near

her, silently watching her at her work, he exclaimed all of

a sudden:



"Stop working.  Stop it, I tell you.  Put 'em away. Put 'em

all away, or I'll pinch you."



"But why--why?" Trina protested.



The dentist cuffed her ears.  "I won't have you work."  He

took her knife and her paint-pots away, and made her sit

idly in the window the rest of the afternoon.



It was, however, only when his wits had been stirred with

alcohol that the dentist was brutal to his wife.  At other

times, say three weeks of every month, she was merely an

incumbrance to him.  They often quarrelled about Trina's

money, her savings.  The dentist was bent upon having at

least a part of them.  What he would do with the money once

he had it, he did not precisely know.  He would spend it in

royal fashion, no doubt, feasting continually, buying

himself wonderful clothes. The miner's idea of money quickly

gained and lavishly squandered, persisted in his mind.  As

for Trina, the more her husband stormed, the tighter she

drew the strings of the little chamois-skin bag that she hid

at the bottom of her trunk underneath her bridal dress. Her

five thousand dollars invested in Uncle Oelbermann's

business was a glittering, splendid dream which came to her

almost every hour of the day as a solace and a compensation

for all her unhappiness.



At times, when she knew that McTeague was far from

home, she would lock her door, open her trunk, and pile all

her little hoard on her table.  By now it was four hundred

and seven dollars and fifty cents.  Trina would play with

this money by the hour, piling it, and repiling it, or

gathering it all into one heap, and drawing back to the

farthest corner of the room to note the effect, her head on

one side.  She polished the gold pieces with a mixture of

soap and ashes until they shone, wiping them carefully on

her apron.  Or, again, she would draw the heap lovingly

toward her and bury her face in it, delighted at the smell

of it and the feel of the smooth, cool metal on her cheeks. 

She even put the smaller gold pieces in her mouth, and

jingled them there.  She loved her money with an intensity

that she could hardly express.  She would plunge her small

fingers into the pile with little murmurs of affection, her

long, narrow eyes half closed and shining, her breath coming

in long sighs.



"Ah, the dear money, the dear money," she would whisper.  "I

love you so!  All mine, every penny of it.  No one shall

ever, ever get you.  How I've worked for you!  How I've

slaved and saved for you!  And I'm going to get more; I'm

going to get more, more, more; a little every day."



She was still looking for cheaper quarters.  Whenever she

could spare a moment from her work, she would put on her hat

and range up and down the entire neighborhood from Sutter to

Sacramento Streets, going into all the alleys and bystreets,

her head in the air, looking for the "Rooms-to-let" sign. 

But she was in despair.  All the cheaper tenements were

occupied.  She could find no room more reasonable than the

one she and the dentist now occupied.



As time went on, McTeague's idleness became habitual. He

drank no more whiskey than at first, but his dislike for

Trina increased with every day of their poverty, with every

day of Trina's persistent stinginess.  At times--fortunately

rare he was more than ever brutal to her.  He would box her

ears or hit her a great blow with the back of a hair-brush,

or even with his closed fist.  His old-time affection

for his "little woman," unable to stand the test of

privation, had lapsed by degrees, and what little of it was

left was changed, distorted, and made monstrous by the

alcohol.



The people about the house and the clerks at the provision

stores often remarked that Trina's fingertips were swollen

and the nails purple as though they had been shut in a door.

Indeed, this was the explanation she gave.  The fact of the

matter was that McTeague, when he had been drinking, used to

bite them, crunching and grinding them with his immense

teeth, always ingenious enough to remember which were the

sorest. Sometimes he extorted money from her by this means,

but as often as not he did it for his own satisfaction.



And in some strange, inexplicable way this brutality made

Trina all the more affectionate; aroused in her a morbid,

unwholesome love of submission, a strange, unnatural

pleasure in yielding, in surrendering herself to the will of

an irresistible, virile power.



Trina's emotions had narrowed with the narrowing of her

daily life.  They reduced themselves at last to but two, her

passion for her money and her perverted love for her husband

when he was brutal.  She was a strange woman during these

days.



Trina had come to be on very intimate terms with Maria

Macapa, and in the end the dentist's wife and the maid of

all work became great friends.  Maria was constantly in and

out of Trina's room, and, whenever she could, Trina threw a

shawl over her head and returned Maria's calls.  Trina could

reach Zerkow's dirty house without going into the street. 

The back yard of the flat had a gate that opened into a

little inclosure where Zerkow kept his decrepit horse and

ramshackle wagon, and from thence Trina could enter directly

into Maria's kitchen.  Trina made long visits to Maria

during the morning in her dressing-gown and curl papers, and

the two talked at great length over a cup of tea served on

the edge of the sink or a corner of the laundry table.  The

talk was all of their husbands and of what to do when they

came home in aggressive moods.



"You never ought to fight um," advised Maria.  "It only

makes um worse.  Just hump your back, and it's soonest

over."



They told each other of their husbands' brutalities, taking

a strange sort of pride in recounting some particularly

savage blow, each trying to make out that her own husband

was the most cruel.  They critically compared each other's

bruises, each one glad when she could exhibit the worst. 

They exaggerated, they invented details, and, as if proud of

their beatings, as if glorying in their husbands'

mishandling, lied to each other, magnifying their own

maltreatment.  They had long and excited arguments as to

which were the most effective means of punishment, the

rope's ends and cart whips such as Zerkow used, or the fists

and backs of hair-brushes affected by McTeague. Maria

contended that the lash of the whip hurt the most; Trina,

that the butt did the most injury.



Maria showed Trina the holes in the walls and the loosened

boards in the flooring where Zerkow had been searching for

the gold plate.  Of late he had been digging in the back

yard and had ransacked the hay in his horse-shed for the

concealed leather chest he imagined he would find.  But he

was becoming impatient, evidently.



"The way he goes on," Maria told Trina, "is somethun

dreadful. He's gettun regularly sick with it--got a fever

every night--don't sleep, and when he does, talks to

himself.  Says 'More'n a hundred pieces, an' every one of

'em gold.  More'n a hundred pieces, an' every one of 'em

gold.' Then he'll whale me with his whip, and shout, 'You

know where it is.  Tell me, tell me, you swine, or I'll do

for you.'  An' then he'll get down on his knees and whimper,

and beg me to tell um where I've hid it. He's just gone plum

crazy.  Sometimes he has regular fits, he gets so mad, and

rolls on the floor and scratches himself."



One morning in November, about ten o'clock, Trina pasted a

"Made in France" label on the bottom of a Noah's ark, and

leaned back in her chair with a long sigh of relief.  She

had just finished a large Christmas order for Uncle

Oelbermann, and there was nothing else she could do that

morning.  The bed had not yet been made, nor had the

breakfast things been washed.  Trina hesitated for a moment,

then put her chin in the air indifferently.



"Bah!" she said, "let them go till this afternoon.  I don't

care WHEN the room is put to rights, and I know Mac

don't."  She determined that instead of making the bed or

washing the dishes she would go and call on Miss Baker on

the floor below.  The little dressmaker might ask her to

stay to lunch, and that would be something saved, as the

dentist had announced his intention that morning of taking a

long walk out to the Presidio to be gone all day.



But Trina rapped on Miss Baker's door in vain that morning. 

She was out.  Perhaps she was gone to the florist's to buy

some geranium seeds.  However, Old Grannis's door stood a

little ajar, and on hearing Trina at Miss Baker's room, the

old Englishman came out into the hall.



"She's gone out," he said, uncertainly, and in a half

whisper, "went out about half an hour ago.  I--I think she

went to the drug store to get some wafers for the goldfish."



"Don't you go to your dog hospital any more, Mister

Grannis?" said Trina, leaning against the balustrade in the

hall, willing to talk a moment.



Old Grannis stood in the doorway of his room, in his carpet

slippers and faded corduroy jacket that he wore when at

home.



"Why--why," he said, hesitating, tapping his chin

thoughtfully. "You see I'm thinking of giving up the little

hospital."



"Giving it up?"



"You see, the people at the book store where I buy my

pamphlets have found out--I told them of my contrivance for

binding books, and one of the members of the firm came up to

look at it.  He offered me quite a sum if I would sell him

the right of it--the--patent of it--quite a sum.  In fact--

in fact--yes, quite a sum, quite."  He rubbed his chin

tremulously and looked about him on the floor.



"Why, isn't that fine?" said Trina, good-naturedly. "I'm

very glad, Mister Grannis.  Is it a good price?"



"Quite a sum--quite.  In fact, I never dreamed of

having so much money."



"Now, see here, Mister Grannis," said Trina, decisively, "I

want to give you a good piece of advice.  Here are you and

Miss Baker----"  The old Englishman started nervously--"You

and Miss Baker, that have been in love with each other for----"



"Oh, Mrs. McTeague, that subject--if you would please--Miss

Baker is such an estimable lady."



"Fiddlesticks!" said Trina.  "You're in love with each

other, and the whole flat knows it; and you two have been

living here side by side year in and year out, and you've

never said a word to each other.  It's all nonsense.  Now, I

want you should go right in and speak to her just as soon as

she comes home, and say you've come into money and you want

her to marry you."



"Impossible--impossible!" exclaimed the old Englishman,

alarmed and perturbed.  "It's quite out of the question.  I

wouldn't presume."



"Well, do you love her, or not?"



"Really, Mrs. McTeague, I--I--you must excuse me.  It's a

matter so personal--so--I--Oh, yes, I love her.  Oh, yes,

indeed," he exclaimed, suddenly.



"Well, then, she loves you.  She told me so."



"Oh!"



"She did.  She said those very words."



Miss Baker had said nothing of the kind--would have died

sooner than have made such a confession; but Trina had drawn

her own conclusions, like every other lodger of the flat,

and thought the time was come for decided action.



"Now you do just as I tell you, and when she comes home, go

right in and see her, and have it over with.  Now, don't say

another word.  I'm going; but you do just as I tell you."



Trina turned about and went down-stairs.  She had decided,

since Miss Baker was not at home, that she would run over

and see Maria; possibly she could have lunch there.  At any

rate, Maria would offer her a cup of tea.



Old Grannis stood for a long time just as Trina had

left him, his hands trembling, the blood coming and going in

his withered cheeks.



"She said, she--she--she told her--she said that--that----"

he could get no farther.



Then he faced about and entered his room, closing the door

behind him.  For a long time he sat in his armchair, drawn

close to the wall in front of the table on which stood his

piles of pamphlets and his little binding apparatus.



"I wonder," said Trina, as she crossed the yard back of

Zerkow's house, "I wonder what rent Zerkow and Maria pay for

this place. I'll bet it's cheaper than where Mac and I are."



Trina found Maria sitting in front of the kitchen stove, her

chin upon her breast.  Trina went up to her. She was dead. 

And as Trina touched her shoulder, her head rolled sideways

and showed a fearful gash in her throat under her ear.  All

the front of her dress was soaked through and through.



Trina backed sharply away from the body, drawing her hands

up to her very shoulders, her eyes staring and wide, an

expression of unutterable horror twisting her face.



"Oh-h-h!" she exclaimed in a long breath, her voice hardly

rising above a whisper.  "Oh-h, isn't that horrible!" 

Suddenly she turned and fled through the front part of the

house to the street door, that opened upon the little alley. 

She looked wildly about her.  Directly across the way a

butcher's boy was getting into his two-wheeled cart drawn up

in front of the opposite house, while near by a peddler of

wild game was coming down the street, a brace of ducks in

his hand.



"Oh, say--say," gasped Trina, trying to get her voice, "say,

come over here quick."



The butcher's boy paused, one foot on the wheel, and stared.

Trina beckoned frantically.



"Come over here, come over here quick."



The young fellow swung himself into his seat.



"What's the matter with that woman?" he said, half aloud.



"There's a murder been done," cried Trina, swaying in

the doorway.



The young fellow drove away, his head over his shoulder,

staring at Trina with eyes that were fixed and absolutely

devoid of expression.



"What's the matter with that woman?" he said again to

himself as he turned the corner.



Trina wondered why she didn't scream, how she could keep

from it--how, at such a moment as this, she could remember

that it was improper to make a disturbance and create a

scene in the street.  The peddler of wild game was looking

at her suspiciously.  It would not do to tell him.  He would

go away like the butcher's boy.



"Now, wait a minute," Trina said to herself, speaking aloud.

She put her hands to her head.  "Now, wait a minute.  It

won't do for me to lose my wits now.  What must I do?"  She

looked about her.  There was the same familiar aspect of

Polk Street. She could see it at the end of the alley.  The

big market opposite the flat, the delivery carts rattling up

and down, the great ladies from the avenue at their morning

shopping, the cable cars trundling past, loaded with

passengers.  She saw a little boy in a flat leather cap

whistling and calling for an unseen dog, slapping his small

knee from time to time.  Two men came out of Frenna's

saloon, laughing heartily.  Heise the harness-maker stood in

the vestibule of his shop, a bundle of whittlings in his

apron of greasy ticking.  And all this was going on, people

were laughing and living, buying and selling, walking about

out there on the sunny sidewalks, while behind her in there

--in there--in there----



Heise started back from the sudden apparition of a white-

lipped woman in a blue dressing-gown that seemed to rise up

before him from his very doorstep.



"Well, Mrs. McTeague, you did scare me, for----"



"Oh, come over here quick."  Trina put her hand to her neck;

swallowing something that seemed to be choking her. 

"Maria's killed--Zerkow's wife--I found her."



"Get out!" exclaimed Heise, "you're joking."



"Come over here--over into the house--I found her--she's

dead."



Heise dashed across the street on the run, with Trina at his

heels, a trail of spilled whittlings marking his course. 

The two ran down the alley.  The wild-game peddler, a woman

who had been washing down the steps in a neighboring house,

and a man in a broad-brimmed hat stood at Zerkow's doorway,

looking in from time to time, and talking together.  They

seemed puzzled.



"Anything wrong in here?" asked the wild-game peddler as

Heise and Trina came up.  Two more men stopped on the corner

of the alley and Polk Street and looked at the group.  A

woman with a towel round her head raised a window opposite

Zerkow's house and called to the woman who had been washing

the steps, "What is it, Mrs. Flint?"



Heise was already inside the house.  He turned to Trina,

panting from his run.



"Where did you say--where was it--where?"



"In there," said Trina, "farther in--the next room."  They

burst into the kitchen.



"LORD!" ejaculated Heise, stopping a yard or so from the

body, and bending down to peer into the gray face with its

brown lips.



"By God! he's killed her."



"Who?"



"Zerkow, by God! he's killed her.  Cut her throat.  He

always said he would."



"Zerkow?"



"He's killed her.  Her throat's cut.  Good Lord, how she did

bleed!  By God! he's done for her in good shape this time."



"Oh, I told her--I TOLD her," cried Trina.



"He's done for her SURE this time."



"She said she could always manage--Oh-h!  It's horrible."



"He's done for her sure this trip.  Cut her throat. 

LORD, how she has BLED!  Did you ever see so much--

that's murder--that's cold-blooded murder.  He's killed

her.  Say, we must get a policeman.  Come on."



They turned back through the house.  Half a dozen people--

the wild-game peddler, the man with the broad-brimmed hat,

the washwoman, and three other men--were in the front room

of the junk shop, a bank of excited faces surged at the

door.  Beyond this, outside, the crowd was packed solid from

one end of the alley to the other.  Out in Polk Street the

cable cars were nearly blocked and were bunting a way slowly

through the throng with clanging bells.  Every window had

its group.  And as Trina and the harness-maker tried to

force the way from the door of the junk shop the throng

suddenly parted right and left before the passage of two

blue-coated policemen who clove a passage through the press,

working their elbows energetically.  They were accompanied

by a third man in citizen's clothes.



Heise and Trina went back into the kitchen with the two

policemen, the third man in citizen's clothes cleared the

intruders from the front room of the junk shop and kept the

crowd back, his arm across the open door.



"Whew!" whistled one of the officers as they came out into

the kitchen, "cutting scrape?  By George!  SOMEBODY'S

been using his knife all right."  He turned to the other

officer.  "Better get the wagon.  There's a box on the

second corner south.  Now, then," he continued, turning to

Trina and the harness-maker and taking out his note-book and

pencil, "I want your names and addresses."



It was a day of tremendous excitement for the entire street.

Long after the patrol wagon had driven away, the crowd

remained.  In fact, until seven o'clock that evening groups

collected about the door of the junk shop, where a policeman

stood guard, asking all manner of questions, advancing all

manner of opinions.



"Do you think they'll get him?" asked Ryer of the policeman. 

A dozen necks craned forward eagerly.



"Hoh, we'll get him all right, easy enough," answered the

other, with a grand air.



"What?  What's that?  What did he say?" asked the

people on the outskirts of the group.  Those in front passed

the answer back.



"He says they'll get him all right, easy enough."



The group looked at the policeman admiringly.



"He's skipped to San Jose."



Where the rumor started, and how, no one knew.  But every

one seemed persuaded that Zerkow had gone to San Jose.



"But what did he kill her for?  Was he drunk?"



"No, he was crazy, I tell you--crazy in the head.  Thought

she was hiding some money from him."



Frenna did a big business all day long.  The murder was the

one subject of conversation.  Little parties were made up in

his saloon--parties of twos and threes--to go over and have

a look at the outside of the junk shop.  Heise was the most

important man the length and breadth of Polk Street; almost

invariably he accompanied these parties, telling again and

again of the part he had played in the affair.



"It was about eleven o'clock.  I was standing in front of

the shop, when Mrs. McTeague--you know, the dentist's wife--

came running across the street," and so on and so on.



The next day came a fresh sensation.  Polk Street read of it

in the morning papers.  Towards midnight on the day of the

murder Zerkow's body had been found floating in the bay near

Black Point.  No one knew whether he had drowned himself or

fallen from one of the wharves.  Clutched in both his hands

was a sack full of old and rusty pans, tin dishes--fully a

hundred of them--tin cans, and iron knives and forks,

collected from some dump heap.



"And all this," exclaimed Trina, "on account of a set of

gold dishes that never existed."
