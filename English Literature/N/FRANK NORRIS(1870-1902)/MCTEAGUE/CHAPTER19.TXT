One can hold a scrubbing-brush with two good fingers and the

stumps of two others even if both joints of the thumb are

gone, but it takes considerable practice to get used to it.



Trina became a scrub-woman.  She had taken council of

Selina, and through her had obtained the position of care-

taker in a little memorial kindergarten over on Pacific

Street.  Like Polk Street, it was an accommodation street,

but running through a much poorer and more sordid quarter. 

Trina had a little room over the kindergarten schoolroom.

It was not an unpleasant room.  It looked out upon a sunny

little court floored with boards and used as the children's

playground.  Two great cherry trees grew here, the leaves

almost brushing against the window of Trina's room and

filtering the sunlight so that it fell in round golden spots

upon the floor of the room.  "Like gold pieces," Trina said

to herself.



Trina's work consisted in taking care of the kindergarten

rooms, scrubbing the floors, washing the windows, dusting

and airing, and carrying out the ashes.  Besides this she

earned some five dollars a month by washing down the front

steps of some big flats on Washington Street, and by

cleaning out vacant houses after the tenants had left.  She

saw no one.  Nobody knew her. She went about her work from

dawn to dark, and often entire days passed when she did not

hear the sound of her own voice.  She was alone, a solitary,

abandoned woman, lost in the lowest eddies of the great

city's tide--the tide that always ebbs.



When Trina had been discharged from the hospital after the

operation on her fingers, she found herself alone in the

world, alone with her five thousand dollars.  The interest

of this would support her, and yet allow her to save a

little.



But for a time Trina had thought of giving up the fight

altogether and of joining her family in the southern part of

the State.  But even while she hesitated about this she

received a long letter from her mother, an answer to one she

herself had written just before the amputation of her right-

hand fingers--the last letter she would ever be able to

write.  Mrs. Sieppe's letter was one long lamentation; she

had her own misfortunes to bewail as well as those of her

daughter.  The carpet-cleaning and upholstery business had

failed. Mr. Sieppe and Owgooste had left for New Zealand

with a colonization company, whither Mrs. Sieppe and the

twins were to follow them as soon as the colony established

itself.  So far from helping Trina in her ill fortune, it

was she, her mother, who might some day in the near future

be obliged to turn to Trina for aid.  So Trina had given up

the idea of any help from her family.  For that matter she

needed none.  She still had her five thousand, and Uncle

Oelbermann paid her the interest with a machine-like

regularity.  Now that McTeague had left her, there was one

less mouth to feed; and with this saving, together with the

little she could earn as scrub-woman, Trina could

almost manage to make good the amount she lost by being

obliged to cease work upon the Noah's ark animals.



Little by little her sorrow over the loss of her precious

savings overcame the grief of McTeague's desertion of her. 

Her avarice had grown to be her one dominant passion; her

love of money for the money's sake brooded in her heart,

driving out by degrees every other natural affection.  She

grew thin and meagre; her flesh clove tight to her small

skeleton; her small pale mouth and little uplifted chin grew

to have a certain feline eagerness of expression; her long,

narrow eyes glistened continually, as if they caught and

held the glint of metal.  One day as she sat in her room,

the empty brass match-box and the limp chamois bag in her

hands, she suddenly exclaimed:



"I could have forgiven him if he had only gone away and left

me my money.  I could have--yes, I could have forgiven him

even THIS"--she looked at the stumps of her fingers.

"But now," her teeth closed tight and her eyes flashed,

"now--I'll--never--forgive--him--as-long--as--I--live."



The empty bag and the hollow, light match-box troubled her. 

Day after day she took them from her trunk and wept over

them as other women weep over a dead baby's shoe.  Her four

hundred dollars were gone, were gone, were gone.  She would

never see them again.  She could plainly see her husband

spending her savings by handfuls; squandering her beautiful

gold pieces that she had been at such pains to polish with

soap and ashes.  The thought filled her with an unspeakable

anguish.  She would wake at night from a dream of McTeague

revelling down her money, and ask of the darkness, "How much

did he spend to-day?  How many of the gold pieces are left? 

Has he broken either of the two twenty-dollar pieces yet? 

What did he spend it for?"



The instant she was out of the hospital Trina had begun to

save again, but now it was with an eagerness that amounted

at times to a veritable frenzy.  She even denied herself

lights and fuel in order to put by a quarter or so, grudging

every penny she was obliged to spend.  She did her own

washing and cooking.  Finally she sold her wedding dress,

that had hitherto lain in the bottom of her trunk.



The day she moved from Zerkow's old house, she came suddenly

upon the dentist's concertina under a heap of old clothes in

the closet.  Within twenty minutes she had sold it to the

dealer in second-hand furniture, returning to her room with

seven dollars in her pocket, happy for the first time since

McTeague had left her.



But for all that the match-box and the bag refused to fill

up; after three weeks of the most rigid economy they

contained but eighteen dollars and some small change.  What

was that compared with four hundred?  Trina told herself

that she must have her money in hand.  She longed to see

again the heap of it upon her work-table, where she could

plunge her hands into it, her face into it, feeling the

cool, smooth metal upon her cheeks.  At such moments she

would see in her imagination her wonderful five thousand

dollars piled in columns, shining and gleaming somewhere at

the bottom of Uncle Oelbermann's vault.  She would look at

the paper that Uncle Oelbermann had given her, and tell

herself that it represented five thousand dollars.  But in

the end this ceased to satisfy her, she must have the money

itself. She must have her four hundred dollars back again,

there in her trunk, in her bag and her match-box, where she

could touch it and see it whenever she desired.



At length she could stand it no longer, and one day

presented herself before Uncle Oelbermann as he sat in his

office in the wholesale toy store, and told him she wanted

to have four hundred dollars of her money.



"But this is very irregular, you know, Mrs. McTeague," said

the great man.  "Not business-like at all."



But his niece's misfortunes and the sight of her poor maimed

hand appealed to him.  He opened his check-book.  "You

understand, of course," he said, "that this will reduce the

amount of your interest by just so much."



"I know, I know.  I've thought of that," said Trina.



"Four hundred, did you say?" remarked Uncle Oelbermann,

taking the cap from his fountain pen.



"Yes, four hundred," exclaimed Trina, quickly, her eyes

glistening.



Trina cashed the check and returned home with the money--all

in twenty-dollar pieces as she had desired--in an ecstasy of

delight.  For half of that night she sat up playing with her

money, counting it and recounting it, polishing the duller

pieces until they shone.  Altogether there were twenty

twenty-dollar gold pieces.



"Oh-h, you beauties!" murmured Trina, running her palms over

them, fairly quivering with pleasure.  "You beauties!  

IS there anything prettier than a twenty-dollar gold piece?

You dear, dear money!  Oh, don't I LOVE you!  Mine, mine,

mine--all of you mine."



She laid them out in a row on the ledge of the table, or

arranged them in patterns--triangles, circles, and squares--

or built them all up into a pyramid which she afterward

overthrew for the sake of hearing the delicious clink of the

pieces tumbling against each other.  Then at last she put

them away in the brass match-box and chamois bag, delighted

beyond words that they were once more full and heavy.



Then, a few days after, the thought of the money still

remaining in Uncle Oelbermann's keeping returned to her.  It

was hers, all hers--all that four thousand six hundred.  She

could have as much of it or as little of it as she chose. 

She only had to ask.  For a week Trina resisted, knowing

very well that taking from her capital was proportionately

reducing her monthly income.  Then at last she yielded.



"Just to make it an even five hundred, anyhow," she told

herself.  That day she drew a hundred dollars more, in

twenty-dollar gold pieces as before.  From that time Trina

began to draw steadily upon her capital, a little at a time. 

It was a passion with her, a mania, a veritable mental

disease; a temptation such as drunkards only know.



It would come upon her all of a sudden.  While she was about

her work, scrubbing the floor of some vacant house; or in

her room, in the morning, as she made her coffee on the oil

stove, or when she woke in the night, a brusque access

of cupidity would seize upon her.  Her cheeks flushed, her

eyes glistened, her breath came short.  At times she would

leave her work just as it was, put on her old bonnet of

black straw, throw her shawl about her, and go straight to

Uncle Oelbermann's store and draw against her money.  Now it

would be a hundred dollars, now sixty; now she would content

herself with only twenty; and once, after a fortnight's

abstinence, she permitted herself a positive debauch of five

hundred.  Little by little she drew her capital from Uncle

Oelbermann, and little by little her original interest of

twenty-five dollars a month dwindled.



One day she presented herself again in the office of the

whole-sale toy store.



"Will you let me have a check for two hundred dollars, Uncle

Oelbermann?" she said.



The great man laid down his fountain pen and leaned back in

his swivel chair with great deliberation.



"I don't understand, Mrs. McTeague," he said.  "Every week

you come here and draw out a little of your money. I've told

you that it is not at all regular or business-like for me to

let you have it this way.  And more than this, it's a great

inconvenience to me to give you these checks at unstated

times. If you wish to draw out the whole amount let's have

some understanding.  Draw it in monthly installments of,

say, five hundred dollars, or else," he added, abruptly,

"draw it all at once, now, to-day.  I would even prefer it

that way.  Otherwise it's--it's annoying.  Come, shall I

draw you a check for thirty-seven hundred, and have it over

and done with?"



"No, no," cried Trina, with instinctive apprehension,

refusing, she did not know why.  "No, I'll leave it with

you.  I won't draw out any more."



She took her departure, but paused on the pavement outside

the store, and stood for a moment lost in thought, her eyes

beginning to glisten and her breath coming short.  Slowly

she turned about and reentered the store; she came back into

the office, and stood trembling at the corner of Uncle

Oelbermann's desk.  He looked up sharply.  Twice Trina

tried to get her voice, and when it did come to her, she

could hardly recognize it.  Between breaths she said:



"Yes, all right--I'll--you can give me--will you give me a

check for thirty-seven hundred?  Give me ALL of my

money."



A few hours later she entered her little room over the

kindergarten, bolted the door with shaking fingers, and

emptied a heavy canvas sack upon the middle of her bed.

Then she opened her trunk, and taking thence the brass

match-box and chamois-skin bag added their contents to the

pile.  Next she laid herself upon the bed and gathered the

gleaming heaps of gold pieces to her with both arms, burying

her face in them with long sighs of unspeakable delight.



It was a little past noon, and the day was fine and warm. 

The leaves of the huge cherry trees threw off a certain

pungent aroma that entered through the open window, together

with long thin shafts of golden sunlight.  Below, in the

kindergarten, the children were singing gayly and marching

to the jangling of the piano.  Trina heard nothing, saw

nothing.  She lay on her bed, her eyes closed, her face

buried in a pile of gold that she encircled with both her

arms.



Trina even told herself at last that she was happy once

more. McTeague became a memory--a memory that faded a little

every day--dim and indistinct in the golden splendor of five

thousand dollars.



"And yet," Trina would say, "I did love Mac, loved him

dearly, only a little while ago.  Even when he hurt me, it

only made me love him more.  How is it I've changed so

sudden?  How COULD I forget him so soon? It must be

because he stole my money. That is it.  I couldn't forgive

anyone that--no, not even my MOTHER.  And I never--

never--will forgive him."



What had become of her husband Trina did not know.  She

never saw any of the old Polk Street people.  There was no

way she could have news of him, even if she had cared to

have it.  She had her money, that was the main thing.  Her

passion for it excluded every other sentiment.  There it was

in the bottom of her trunk, in the canvas sack, the

chamois-skin bag, and the little brass match-safe.  Not a

day passed that Trina did not have it out where she could

see and touch it.  One evening she had even spread all the

gold pieces between the sheets, and had then gone to bed,

stripping herself, and had slept all night upon the money,

taking a strange and ecstatic pleasure in the touch of the

smooth flat pieces the length of her entire body.



One night, some three months after she had come to live at

the kindergarten, Trina was awakened by a sharp tap on the

pane of the window.  She sat up quickly in bed, her heart

beating thickly, her eyes rolling wildly in the direction of

her trunk. The tap was repeated. Trina rose and went

fearfully to the window.  The little court below was bright

with moonlight, and standing just on the edge of the shadow

thrown by one of the cherry trees was McTeague.  A bunch of

half-ripe cherries was in his hand.  He was eating them and

throwing the pits at the window.  As he caught sight of her,

he made an eager sign for her to raise the sash.  Reluctant

and wondering, Trina obeyed, and the dentist came quickly

forward.  He was wearing a pair of blue overalls; a navy-

blue flannel shirt without a cravat; an old coat, faded,

rain-washed, and ripped at the seams; and his woollen cap.



"Say, Trina," he exclaimed, his heavy bass voice pitched

just above a whisper, "let me in, will you, huh?  Say, will

you?  I'm regularly starving, and I haven't slept in a

Christian bed for two weeks."



At sight at him standing there in the moonlight, Trina could

only think of him as the man who had beaten and bitten her,

had deserted her and stolen her money, had made her suffer

as she had never suffered before in all her life.  Now that

he had spent the money that he had stolen from her, he was

whining to come back--so that he might steal more, no doubt. 

Once in her room he could not help but smell out her five

thousand dollars. Her indignation rose.



"No," she whispered back at him.  "No, I will not let you

in."



"But listen here, Trina, I tell you I am starving,

regularly----"



"Hoh!" interrupted Trina scornfully.  "A man can't

starve with four hundred dollars, I guess."



"Well--well--I--well--" faltered the dentist.  "Never mind

now. Give me something to eat, an' let me in an' sleep.

I've been sleeping in the Plaza for the last ten nights, and

say, I--Damn it, Trina, I ain't had anything to eat since--"



"Where's the four hundred dollars you robbed me of when you

deserted me?" returned Trina, coldly.



"Well, I've spent it," growled the dentist.  "But you

CAN'T see me starve, Trina, no matter what's happened.

Give me a little money, then."



"I'll see you starve before you get any more of MY

money."



The dentist stepped back a pace and stared up at her wonder-

stricken.  His face was lean and pinched.  Never had the jaw

bone looked so enormous, nor the square-cut head so huge.

The moonlight made deep black shadows in the shrunken

cheeks.



"Huh?" asked the dentist, puzzled.  "What did you say?"



"I won't give you any money--never again--not a cent."



"But do you know that I'm hungry?"



"Well, I've been hungry myself.  Besides, I DON'T

believe you."



"Trina, I ain't had a thing to eat since yesterday morning;

that's God's truth.  Even if I did get off with your money,

you CAN'T see me starve, can you?  You can't see me walk

the streets all night because I ain't got a place to sleep. 

Will you let me in?  Say, will you?  Huh?"



"No."



"Well, will you give me some money then--just a little? 

Give me a dollar.  Give me half a dol--Say, give me a

DIME, an' I can get a cup of coffee."



"No."



The dentist paused and looked at her with curious

intentness, bewildered, nonplussed.



"Say, you--you must be crazy, Trina.  I--I--wouldn't let a

DOG go hungry."



"Not even if he'd bitten you, perhaps."



The dentist stared again.



There was another pause.  McTeague looked up at her in

silence, a mean and vicious twinkle coming into his small

eyes.  He uttered a low exclamation, and then checked

himself.



"Well, look here, for the last time.  I'm starving. I've got

nowhere to sleep.  Will you give me some money, or something

to eat?  Will you let me in?"



"No--no--no."



Trina could fancy she almost saw the brassy glint in her

husband's eyes.  He raised one enormous lean fist. Then he

growled:



"If I had hold of you for a minute, by God, I'd make you

dance. An' I will yet, I will yet.  Don't you be afraid of

that."



He turned about, the moonlight showing like a layer of snow

upon his massive shoulders.  Trina watched him as he passed

under the shadow of the cherry trees and crossed the little

court.  She heard his great feet grinding on the board

flooring.  He disappeared.



Miser though she was, Trina was only human, and the echo of

the dentist's heavy feet had not died away before she began

to he sorry for what she had done.  She stood by the open

window in her nightgown, her finger upon her lips.



"He did looked pinched," she said half aloud.  "Maybe he

WAS hungry.  I ought to have given him something.  I wish I

had, I WISH I had.  Oh," she cried, suddenly, with a

frightened gesture of both hands, "what have I come to be

that I would see Mac--my husband--that I would see him

starve rather than give him money?  No, no.  It's too

dreadful.  I WILL give him some.  I'll send it to him

to-morrow.  Where?--well, he'll come back."  She leaned from

the window and called as loudly as she dared, "Mac, oh,

Mac."  There was no answer.



When McTeague had told Trina he had been without food for

nearly two days he was speaking the truth.  The week before

he had spent the last of the four hundred dollars in the bar

of a sailor's lodging-house near the water front, and since

that time had lived a veritable hand-to-mouth existence.



He had spent her money here and there about the city in

royal fashion, absolutely reckless of the morrow, feasting

and drinking for the most part with companions he

picked up heaven knows where, acquaintances of twenty-four

hours, whose names he forgot in two days.  Then suddenly he

found himself at the end of his money.  He no longer had any

friends.  Hunger rode him and rowelled him.  He was no

longer well fed, comfortable. There was no longer a warm

place for him to sleep.  He went back to Polk Street in the

evening, walking on the dark side of the street, lurking in

the shadows, ashamed to have any of his old-time friends see

him.  He entered Zerkow's old house and knocked at the door

of the room Trina and he had occupied.  It was empty.



Next day he went to Uncle Oelbermann's store and asked news

of Trina.  Trina had not told Uncle Oelbermann of McTeague's

brutalities, giving him other reasons to explain the loss of

her fingers; neither had she told him of her husband's

robbery.  So when the dentist had asked where Trina could be

found, Uncle Oelbermann, believing that McTeague was seeking

a reconciliation, had told him without hesitation, and, he

added:



"She was in here only yesterday and drew out the balance of

her money.  She's been drawing against her money for the

last month or so.  She's got it all now, I guess."



"Ah, she's got it all."



The dentist went away from his bootless visit to his wife

shaking with rage, hating her with all the strength of a

crude and primitive nature.  He clenched his fists till his

knuckles whitened, his teeth ground furiously upon one

another.



"Ah, if I had hold of you once, I'd make you dance. She had

five thousand dollars in that room, while I stood there, not

twenty feet away, and told her I was starving, and she

wouldn't give me a dime to get a cup of coffee with; not a

dime to get a cup of coffee. Oh, if I once get my hands on

you!"  His wrath strangled him.  He clutched at the darkness

in front of him, his breath fairly whistling between his

teeth.



That night he walked the streets until the morning,

wondering what now he was to do to fight the wolf away.  The

morning of the next day towards ten o'clock he was on

Kearney Street, still walking, still tramping the streets,

since there was nothing else for him to do.  By and by

he paused on a corner near a music store, finding a

momentary amusement in watching two or three men loading a

piano upon a dray.  Already half its weight was supported by

the dray's backboard. One of the men, a big mulatto, almost

hidden under the mass of glistening rosewood, was guiding

its course, while the other two heaved and tugged in the 

rear. Something in the street frightened the horses and they

shied abruptly.  The end of the piano was twitched sharply

from the backboard.  There was a cry, the mulatto staggered

and fell with the falling piano, and its weight dropped

squarely upon his thigh, which broke with a resounding

crack.



An hour later McTeague had found his job.  The music store

engaged him as handler at six dollars a week.  McTeague's

enormous strength, useless all his life, stood him in good

stead at last.



He slept in a tiny back room opening from the storeroom of

the music store.  He was in some sense a watchman as well as

handler, and went the rounds of the store twice every night.

His room was a box of a place that reeked with odors of

stale tobacco smoke.  The former occupant had papered the

walls with newspapers and had pasted up figures cut out from

the posters of some Kiralfy ballet, very gaudy.  By the one

window, chittering all day in its little gilt prison, hung

the canary bird, a tiny atom of life that McTeague still

clung to with a strange obstinacy.



McTeague drank a good deal of whiskey in these days, but the

only effect it had upon him was to increase the viciousness

and bad temper that had developed in him since the beginning

of his misfortunes.  He terrorized his fellow-handlers,

powerful men though they were.  For a gruff word, for an

awkward movement in lading the pianos, for a surly look or a

muttered oath, the dentist's elbow would crook and his hand

contract to a mallet-like fist.  As often as not the blow

followed, colossal in its force, swift as the leap of the

piston from its cylinder.



His hatred of Trina increased from day to day.  He'd make

her dance yet.  Wait only till he got his hands upon her. 

She'd let him starve, would she?  She'd turn him out of

doors while she hid her five thousand dollars in the bottom

of her trunk.  Aha, he would see about that some day.

She couldn't make small of him.  Ah, no.  She'd dance all

right--all right. McTeague was not an imaginative man by

nature, but he would lie awake nights, his clumsy wits

galloping and frisking under the lash of the alcohol, and

fancy himself thrashing his wife, till a sudden frenzy of

rage would overcome him, and he would shake all over,

rolling upon the bed and biting the mattress.



On a certain day, about a week after Christmas of that year,

McTeague was on one of the top floors of the music store,

where the second-hand instruments were kept, helping to move

about and rearrange some old pianos.  As he passed by one of

the counters he paused abruptly, his eye caught by an object

that was strangely familiar.



"Say," he inquired, addressing the clerk in charge, "say,

where'd this come from?"



"Why, let's see.  We got that from a second-hand store up on

Polk Street, I guess.  It's a fairly good machine; a little

tinkering with the stops and a bit of shellac, and we'll

make it about's good as new.  Good tone.  See."  And the

clerk drew a long, sonorous wail from the depths of

McTeague's old concertina.



"Well, it's mine," growled the dentist.



The other laughed.  "It's yours for eleven dollars."



"It's mine," persisted McTeague.  "I want it."



"Go 'long with you, Mac.  What do you mean?"



"I mean that it's mine, that's what I mean.  You got no

right to it.  It was STOLEN from me, that's what I

mean," he added, a sullen anger flaming up in his little

eyes.



The clerk raised a shoulder and put the concertina on an

upper shelf.



"You talk to the boss about that; t'ain't none of my affair. 

If you want to buy it, it's eleven dollars."



The dentist had been paid off the day before and had four

dollars in his wallet at the moment.  He gave the money to

the clerk.



"Here, there's part of the money.  You--you put that

concertina aside for me, an' I'll give you the rest in a

week or so--I'll give it to you tomorrow," he

exclaimed, struck with a sudden idea.



McTeague had sadly missed his concertina.  Sunday afternoons

when there was no work to be done, he was accustomed to lie

flat on his back on his springless bed in the little room in

the rear of the music store, his coat and shoes off, reading

the paper, drinking steam beer from a pitcher, and smoking

his pipe.  But he could no longer play his six lugubrious

airs upon his concertina, and it was a deprivation.  He

often wondered where it was gone.  It had been lost, no

doubt, in the general wreck of his fortunes.  Once, even,

the dentist had taken a concertina from the lot kept by the

music store.  It was a Sunday and no one was about.  But he

found he could not play upon it. The stops were arranged

upon a system he did not understand.



Now his own concertina was come back to him.  He would buy

it back.  He had given the clerk four dollars.  He knew

where he would get the remaining seven.



The clerk had told him the concertina had been sold on Polk

Street to the second-hand store there.  Trina had sold it.

McTeague knew it.  Trina had sold his concertina--had stolen

it and sold it--his concertina, his beloved concertina, that

he had had all his life.  Why, barring the canary, there was

not one of all his belongings that McTeague had cherished

more dearly.  His steel engraving of "Lorenzo de' Medici and

his Court" might be lost, his stone pug dog might go, but

his concertina!



"And she sold it--stole it from me and sold it.  Just

because I happened to forget to take it along with me. Well,

we'll just see about that.  You'll give me the money to buy

it back, or----"



His rage loomed big within him.  His hatred of Trina came

back upon him like a returning surge.  He saw her small,

prim mouth, her narrow blue eyes, her black mane of hair,

and up-tilted chin, and hated her the more because of them. 

Aha, he'd show her; he'd make her dance.  He'd get that

seven dollars from her, or he'd know the reason why.  He

went through his work that day, heaving and hauling at the

ponderous pianos, handling them with the ease of a lifting

crane, impatient for the coming of evening, when he could be

left to his own devices.  As often as he had a moment

to spare he went down the street to the nearest saloon and

drank a pony of whiskey.  Now and then as he fought and

struggled with the vast masses of ebony, rosewood, and

mahogany on the upper floor of the music store, raging and

chafing at their inertness and unwillingness, while the

whiskey pirouetted in his brain, he would mutter to himself:



"An' I got to do this.  I got to work like a dray horse

while she sits at home by her stove and counts her money--

and sells my concertina."



Six o'clock came.  Instead of supper, McTeague drank some

more whiskey, five ponies in rapid succession.  After supper

he was obliged to go out with the dray to deliver a concert

grand at the Odd Fellows' Hall, where a piano "recital" was

to take place.



"Ain't you coming back with us?" asked one of the handlers

as he climbed upon the driver's seat after the piano had

been put in place.



"No, no," returned the dentist; "I got something else to

do."  The brilliant lights of a saloon near the City Hall

caught his eye.  He decided he would have another drink of

whiskey.  It was about eight o'clock.



The following day was to be a fete day at the

kindergarten, the Christmas and New Year festivals combined. 

All that afternoon the little two-story building on Pacific

Street had been filled with a number of grand ladies of the

Kindergarten Board, who were hanging up ropes of evergreen

and sprays of holly, and arranging a great Christmas tree

that stood in the centre of the ring in the schoolroom.  The

whole place was pervaded with a pungent, piney odor.  Trina

had been very busy since the early morning, coming and going

at everybody's call, now running down the street after

another tack-hammer or a fresh supply of cranberries, now

tying together the ropes of evergreen and passing them up to

one of the grand ladies as she carefully balanced herself on

a step-ladder.  By evening everything was in place.  As the

last grand lady left the school, she gave Trina an extra

dollar for her work, and said:



"Now, if you'll just tidy up here, Mrs. McTeague, I think

that will be all.  Sweep up the pine needles here--you

see they are all over the floor--and look through all the

rooms, and tidy up generally.  Good night--and a Happy New

Year," she cried pleasantly as she went out.



Trina put the dollar away in her trunk before she did

anything else and cooked herself a bit of supper. Then she

came downstairs again.



The kindergarten was not large.  On the lower floor were but

two rooms, the main schoolroom and another room, a

cloakroom, very small, where the children hung their hats

and coats.  This cloakroom opened off the back of the main

schoolroom.  Trina cast a critical glance into both of these

rooms.  There had been a great deal of going and coming in

them during the day, and she decided that the first thing to

do would be to scrub the floors. She went up again to her

room overhead and heated some water over her oil stove;

then, re-descending, set to work vigorously.



By nine o'clock she had almost finished with the schoolroom.

She was down on her hands and knees in the midst of a

steaming muck of soapy water.  On her feet were a pair of

man's shoes fastened with buckles; a dirty cotton gown, damp

with the water, clung about her shapeless, stunted figure. 

From time to time she sat back on her heels to ease the

strain of her position, and with one smoking hand, white and

parboiled with the hot water, brushed her hair, already

streaked with gray, out of her weazened, pale face and the

corners of her mouth.



It was very quiet.  A gas-jet without a globe lit up the

place with a crude, raw light.  The cat who lived on the

premises, preferring to be dirty rather than to be wet, had

got into the coal scuttle, and over its rim watched her

sleepily with a long, complacent purr.



All at once he stopped purring, leaving an abrupt silence in

the air like the sudden shutting off of a stream of water,

while his eyes grew wide, two lambent disks of yellow in the

heap of black fur.



"Who is there?" cried Trina, sitting back on her heels. In

the stillness that succeeded, the water dripped from her

hands with the steady tick of a clock.  Then a brutal

fist swung open the street door of the schoolroom and

McTeague came in.  He was drunk; not with that drunkenness

which is stupid, maudlin, wavering on its feet, but with

that which is alert, unnaturally intelligent, vicious,

perfectly steady, deadly wicked.  Trina only had to look

once at him, and in an instant, with some strange sixth

sense, born of the occasion, knew what she had to expect.



She jumped up and ran from him into the little cloakroom. 

She locked and bolted the door after her, and leaned her

weight against it, panting and trembling, every nerve

shrinking and quivering with the fear of him.



McTeague put his hand on the knob of the door outside and

opened it, tearing off the lock and bolt guard, and sending

her staggering across the room.



"Mac," she cried to him, as he came in, speaking with horrid

rapidity, cringing and holding out her hands, "Mac, listen.

Wait a minute--look here--listen here. It wasn't my fault. 

I'll give you some money.  You can come back.  I'll do

ANYTHING you want.  Won't you just LISTEN to me?  Oh,

don't!  I'll scream.  I can't help it, you know.  The people

will hear."



McTeague came towards her slowly, his immense feet dragging

and grinding on the floor; his enormous fists, hard as

wooden mallets, swinging at his sides. Trina backed from him

to the corner of the room, cowering before him, holding her

elbow crooked in front of her face, watching him with

fearful intentness, ready to dodge.



"I want that money," he said, pausing in front of her.



"What money?" cried Trina.



"I want that money.  You got it--that five thousand dollars. 

I want every nickel of it!  You understand?"



"I haven't it.  It isn't here.  Uncle Oelbermann's got it."



"That's a lie.  He told me that you came and got it. You've

had it long enough; now I want it.  Do you hear?"



"Mac, I can't give you that money.  I--I WON'T give it

to you," Trina cried, with sudden resolution.



"Yes, you will.  You'll give me every nickel of it."



"No, NO."



"You ain't going to make small of me this time.  Give me

that money."



"NO."



"For the last time, will you give me that money?"



"No."



"You won't, huh?  You won't give me it?  For the last time."



"No, NO."



Usually the dentist was slow in his movements, but now the

alcohol had awakened in him an ape-like agility.  He kept

his small eyes upon her, and all at once sent his fist into

the middle of her face with the suddenness of a relaxed

spring.



Beside herself with terror, Trina turned and fought him

back; fought for her miserable life with the exasperation

and strength of a harassed cat; and with such energy and

such wild, unnatural force, that even McTeague for the

moment drew back from her. But her resistance was the one

thing to drive him to the top of his fury.  He came back at

her again, his eyes drawn to two fine twinkling points, and

his enormous fists, clenched till the knuckles whitened,

raised in the air.



Then it became abominable.



In the schoolroom outside, behind the coal scuttle, the cat

listened to the sounds of stamping and struggling and the

muffled noise of blows, wildly terrified, his eyes bulging

like brass knobs.  At last the sounds stopped on a sudden;

he heard nothing more.  Then McTeague came out, closing the

door.  The cat followed him with distended eyes as he

crossed the room and disappeared through the street door.



The dentist paused for a moment on the sidewalk, looking

carefully up and down the street.  It was deserted and

quiet. He turned sharply to the right and went down a narrow

passage that led into the little court yard behind the

school.  A candle was burning in Trina's room.  He went up

by the outside stairway and entered.



The trunk stood locked in one corner of the room.  The

dentist took the lid-lifter from the little oil stove, put

it underneath the lock-clasp and wrenched it open.

Groping beneath a pile of dresses he found the chamois-skin

bag, the little brass match-box, and, at the very bottom,

carefully thrust into one corner, the canvas sack crammed to

the mouth with twenty-dollar gold pieces.  He emptied the

chamois-skin bag and the matchbox into the pockets of his

trousers.  But the canvas sack was too bulky to hide about

his clothes.  "I guess I'll just naturally have to carry

YOU," he muttered.  He blew out the candle, closed the

door, and gained the street again.



The dentist crossed the city, going back to the music store. 

It was a little after eleven o'clock.  The night was

moonless, filled with a gray blur of faint light that seemed

to come from all quarters of the horizon at once.  From time

to time there were sudden explosions of a southeast wind at

the street corners. McTeague went on, slanting his head

against the gusts, to keep his cap from blowing off,

carrying the sack close to his side.  Once he looked

critically at the sky.



"I bet it'll rain to-morrow," he muttered, "if this wind

works round to the south."



Once in his little den behind the music store, he washed his

hands and forearms, and put on his working clothes, blue

overalls and a jumper, over cheap trousers and vest.  Then

he got together his small belongings--an old campaign hat, a

pair of boots, a tin of tobacco, and a pinchbeck bracelet

which he had found one Sunday in the Park, and which he

believed to be valuable.  He stripped his blanket from his

bed and rolled up in it all these objects, together with the

canvas sack, fastening the roll with a half hitch such as

miners use, the instincts of the old-time car-boy coming

back to him in his present confusion of mind. He changed his

pipe and his knife--a huge jackknife with a yellowed bone

handle--to the pockets of his overalls.



Then at last he stood with his hand on the door, holding up

the lamp before blowing it out, looking about to make sure

he was ready to go.  The wavering light woke his canary.  It

stirred and began to chitter feebly, very sleepy and cross

at being awakened. McTeague started, staring at it, and

reflecting.  He believed that it would be a long time before

anyone came into that room again.  The canary would be days

without food; it was likely it would starve, would die

there, hour by hour, in its little gilt prison.  McTeague

resolved to take it with him.  He took down the cage,

touching it gently with his enormous hands, and tied a

couple of sacks about it to shelter the little bird from the

sharp night wind.



Then he went out, locking all the doors behind him, and

turned toward the ferry slips.  The boats had ceased running

hours ago, but he told himself that by waiting till four

o'clock he could get across the bay on the tug that took

over the morning papers.



*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *



Trina lay unconscious, just as she had fallen under the last

of McTeague's blows, her body twitching with an occasional

hiccough that stirred the pool of blood in which she lay

face downward. Towards morning she died with a rapid series

of hiccoughs that sounded like a piece of clockwork running

down.



The thing had been done in the cloakroom where the

kindergarten children hung their hats and coats. There was

no other entrance except by going through the main

schoolroom.  McTeague going out had shut the door of the

cloakroom, but had left the street door open; so when the

children arrived in the morning, they entered as usual.



About half-past eight, two or three five-year-olds, one a

little colored girl, came into the schoolroom of the

kindergarten with a great chatter of voices, going across to

the cloakroom to hang up their hats and coats as they had

been taught.



Half way across the room one of them stopped and put her

small nose in the air, crying, "Um-o-o, what a funnee

smell!"  The others began to sniff the air as well, and one,

the daughter of a butcher, exclaimed, "'Tsmells like my pa's

shop," adding in the next breath, "Look, what's the matter

with the kittee?"



In fact, the cat was acting strangely.  He lay quite flat on

the floor, his nose pressed close to the crevice under the

door of the little cloakroom, winding his tail slowly

back and forth, excited, very eager. At times he would draw

back and make a strange little clacking noise down in his

throat.



"Ain't he funnee?" said the little girl again.  The cat

slunk swiftly away as the children came up.  Then the

tallest of the little girls swung the door of the little

cloakroom wide open and they all ran in.
