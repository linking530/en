<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>WHAT purpose I had in view when I was hot on tracing out and proving
Estella's parentage, I cannot say. It will presently be seen that the question
was not before me in a distinct shape, until it was put before me by a
wiser head than my own.

<P>But, when Herbert and I had held our momentous conversation, I was seized
with a feverish conviction that I ought to hunt the matter down - that
I ought not to let it rest, but that I ought to see Mr Jaggers, and come
at the bare truth. I really do not know whether I felt that I did this
for Estella's sake, or whether I was glad to transfer to the man in whose
preservation I was so much concerned, some rays of the romantic interest
that had so long surrounded her. Perhaps the latter possibility may be
the nearer to the truth.

<P>Any way, I could scarcely be withheld from going out to Gerrard-street
that night. Herbert's representations that if I did, I should probably
be laid up and stricken useless, when our fugitive's safety would depend
upon me, alone restrained my impatience. On the understanding, again and
again reiterated, that come what would, I was to go to Mr Jaggers to-morrow,
I at length submitted to keep quiet, and to have my hurts looked after,
and to stay at home. Early next morning we went out together, and at the
corner of Giltspur-street by Smithfield, I left Herbert to go his way into
the City, and took my way to Little Britain.

<P>There were periodical occasions when Mr Jaggers and Wemmick went over
the office accounts, and checked off the vouchers, and put all things straight.
On these occasions Wemmick took his books and papers into Mr Jaggers's
room, and one of the up-stairs clerks came down into the outer office.
Finding such clerk on Wemmick's post that morning, I knew what was going
on; but, I was not sorry to have Mr Jaggers and Wemmick together, as Wemmick
would then hear for himself that I said nothing to compromise him.

<P>My appearance with my arm bandaged and my coat loose over my shoulders,
favoured my object. Although I had sent Mr Jaggers a brief account of the
accident as soon as I had arrived in town, yet I had to give him all the
details now; and the speciality of the occasion caused our talk to be less
dry and hard, and less strictly regulated by the rules of evidence, than
it had been before. While I described the disaster, Mr Jaggers stood, according
to his wont, before the fire. Wemmick leaned back in his chair, staring
at me, with his hands in the pockets of his trousers, and his pen put horizontally
into the post. The two brutal casts, always inseparable in my mind from
the official proceedings, seemed to be congestively considering whether
they didn't smell fire at the present moment.

<P>My narrative finished, and their questions exhausted, I then produced
Miss Havisham's authority to receive the nine hundred pounds for Herbert.
Mr Jaggers's eyes retired a little deeper into his head when I handed him
the tablets, but he presently handed them over to Wemmick, with instructions
to draw the cheque for his signature. While that was in course of being
done, I looked on at Wemmick as he wrote, and Mr Jaggers, poising and swaying
himself on his well-polished boots, looked on at me. `I am sorry, Pip,'
said he, as I put the cheque in my pocket, when he had signed it, `that
we do nothing for <I>you</I>.'

<P>`Miss Havisham was good enough to ask me,' I returned, `whether she
could do nothing for me, and I told her No.'

<P>`Everybody should know his own business,' said Mr Jaggers. And I saw
Wemmick's lips form the words `portable property.'

<P>`I should <I>not</I> have told her No, if I had been you,' said Mr Jaggers;
`but every man ought to know his own business best.'

<P>`Every man's business,' said Wemmick, rather reproachfully towards me,
`is portable property.'

<P>As I thought the time was now come for pursuing the theme I had at heart,
I said, turning on Mr Jaggers:

<P>`I did ask something of Miss Havisham, however, sir. I asked her to
give me some information relative to her adopted daughter, and she gave
me all she possessed.'

<P>`Did she?' said Mr Jaggers, bending forward to look at his boots and
then straightening himself. `Hah! I don't think I should have done so,
if I had been Miss Havisham. But <I>she</I> ought to know her own business
best.'

<P>`I know more of the history of Miss Havisham's adopted child, than Miss
Havisham herself does, sir. I know her mother.'

<P>Mr Jaggers looked at me inquiringly, and repeated `Mother?'

<P>`I have seen her mother within these three days.'

<P>`Yes?' said Mr Jaggers.

<P>`And so have you, sir. And you have seen her still more recently.'

<P>`Yes?' said Mr Jaggers.

<P>`Perhaps I know more of Estella's history than even you do,' said I.
`I know her father too.'

<P>A certain stop that Mr Jaggers came to in his manner - he was too self-possessed
to change his manner, but he could not help its being brought to an indefinably
attentive stop - assured me that he did not know who her father was. This
I had strongly suspected from Provis's account (as Herbert had repeated
it) of his having kept himself dark; which I pieced on to the fact that
he himself was not Mr Jaggers's client until some four years later, and
when he could have no reason for claiming his identity. But, I could not
be sure of this unconsciousness on Mr Jaggers's part before, though I was
quite sure of it now.

<P>`So! You know the young lady's father, Pip?' said Mr Jaggers.

<P>`Yes,' I replied, `and his name is Provis - from New South Wales.'

<P>Even Mr Jaggers started when I said those words. It was the slightest
start that could escape a man, the most carefully repressed and the soonest
checked, but he did start, though he made it a part of the action of taking
out his pocket-handkerchief. How Wemmick received the announcement I am
unable to say, for I was afraid to look at him just then, lest Mr Jaggers's
sharpness should detect that there had been some communication unknown
to him between us.

<P>`And on what evidence, Pip,' asked Mr. Jaggers, very coolly, as he paused
with his handkerchief half way to his nose, `does Provis make this claim?'

<P>`He does not make it,' said I, `and has never made it, and has no knowledge
or belief that his daughter is in existence.'

<P>For once, the powerful pocket-handkerchief failed. My reply was so unexpected
that Mr Jaggers put the handkerchief back into his pocket without completing
the usual performance, folded his arms, and looked with stern attention
at me, though with an immovable face.

<P>Then I told him all I knew, and how I knew it; with the one reservation
that I left him to infer that I knew from Miss Havisham what I in fact
knew from Wemmick. I was very careful indeed as to that. Nor, did I look
towards Wemmick until I had finished all I had to tell, and had been for
some time silently meeting Mr Jaggers's look. When I did at last turn my
eyes in Wemmick's direction, I found that he had unposted his pen, and
was intent upon the table before him.

<P>`Hah!' said Mr Jaggers at last, as he moved towards the papers on the
table, ` - What item was it you were at, Wemmick, when Mr. Pip came in?'

<P>But I could not submit to be thrown off in that way, and I made a passionate,
almost an indignant, appeal to him to be more frank and manly with me.
I reminded him of the false hopes into which I had lapsed, the length of
time they had lasted, and the discovery I had made: and I hinted at the
danger that weighed upon my spirits. I represented myself as being surely
worthy of some little confidence from him, in return for the confidence
I had just now imparted. I said that I did not blame him, or suspect him,
or mistrust him, but I wanted assurance of the truth from him. And if he
asked me why I wanted it and why I thought I had any right to it, I would
tell him, little as he cared for such poor dreams, that I had loved Estella
dearly and long, and that, although I had lost her and must live a bereaved
life, whatever concerned her was still nearer and dearer to me than anything
else in the world. And seeing that Mr Jaggers stood quite still and silent,
and apparently quite obdurate, under this appeal, I turned to Wemmick,
and said, `Wemmick, I know you to be a man with a gentle heart. I have
seen your pleasant home, and your old father, and all the innocent cheerful
playful ways with which you refresh your business life. And I entreat you
to say a word for me to Mr Jaggers, and to represent to him that, all circumstances
considered, he ought to be more open with me!'

<P>I have never seen two men look more oddly at one another than Mr Jaggers
and Wemmick did after this apostrophe. At first, a misgiving crossed me
that Wemmick would be instantly dismissed from his employment; but, it
melted as I saw Mr Jaggers relax into something like a smile, and Wemmick
become bolder.

<P>`What's all this?' said Mr Jaggers. `You with an old father, and you
with pleasant and playful ways?'

<P>`Well!' returned Wemmick. `If I don't bring 'em here, what does it matter?'

<P>`Pip,' said Mr Jaggers, laying his hand upon my arm, and smiling openly,
`this man must be the most cunning impostor in all London.'

<P>`Not a bit of it,' returned Wemmick, growing bolder and bolder. `I think
you're another.'

<P>Again they exchanged their former odd looks, each apparently still distrustful
that the other was taking him in.

<P>`<I>You</I> with a pleasant home?' said Mr Jaggers.

<P>`Since it don't interfere with business,' returned Wemmick, `let it
be so. Now, I look at you, sir, I shouldn't wonder if <I>you</I> might
be planning and contriving to have a pleasant home of your own, one of
these days, when you're tired of all this work.'

<P>Mr Jaggers nodded his head retrospectively two or three times, and actually
drew a sigh. `Pip,' said he, `we won't talk about "poor dreams;" you know
more about such things than I, having much fresher experience of that kind.
But now, about this other matter. I'll put a case to you. Mind! I admit
nothing.'

<P>He waited for me to declare that I quite understood that he expressly
said that he admitted nothing.

<P>`Now, Pip,' said Mr Jaggers, `put this case. Put the case that a woman,
under such circumstances as you have mentioned, held her child concealed,
and was obliged to communicate the fact to her legal adviser, on his representing
to her that he must know, with an eye to the latitude of his defence, how
the fact stood about that child. Put the case that at the same time he
held a trust to find a child for an eccentric rich lady to adopt and bring
up.'

<P>`I follow you, sir.'

<P>`Put the case that he lived in an atmosphere of evil, and that all he
saw of children, was, their being generated in great numbers for certain
destruction. Put the case that he often saw children solemnly tried at
a criminal bar, where they were held up to be seen; put the case that he
habitually knew of their being imprisoned, whipped, transported, neglected,
cast out, qualified in all ways for the hangman, and growing up to be hanged.
Put the case that pretty nigh all the children he saw in his daily business
life, he had reason to look upon as so much spawn, to develop into the
fish that were to come to his net - to be prosecuted, defended, forsworn,
made orphans, bedevilled somehow.'

<P>`I follow you, sir.'

<P>`Put the case, Pip, that here was one pretty little child out of the
heap, who could be saved; whom the father believed dead, and dared make
no stir about; as to whom, over the mother, the legal adviser had this
power: "I know what you did, and how you did it. You came so and so, this
was your manner of attack and this the manner of resistance, you went so
and so, you did such and such things to divert suspicion. I have tracked
you through it all, and I tell it you all. Part with the child, unless
it should be necessary to produce it to clear you, and then it shall be
produced. Give the child into my hands, and I will do my best to bring
you off. If you are saved, your child is saved too; if you are lost, your
child is still saved." Put the case that this was done, and that the woman
was cleared.'

<P>`I understand you perfectly.'

<P>`But that I make no admissions?'

<P>`That you make no admissions.' And Wemmick repeated, `No admissions.'

<P>`Put the case, Pip, that passion and the terror of death had a little
shaken the woman's intellects, and that when she was set at liberty, she
was scared out of the ways of the world and went to him to be sheltered.
Put the case that he took her in, and that he kept down the old wild violent
nature whenever he saw an inkling of its breaking out, by asserting his
power over her in the old way. Do you comprehend the imaginary case?'

<P>`Quite.'

<P>`Put the case that the child grew up, and was married for money. That
the mother was still living. That the father was still living. That the
mother and father unknown to one another, were dwelling within so many
miles, furlongs, yards if you like, of one another. That the secret was
still a secret, except that you had got wind of it. Put that last case
to yourself very carefully.'

<P>`I do.'

<P>`I ask Wemmick to put it to <I>him</I>self very carefully.'

<P>And Wemmick said, `I do.'

<P>`For whose sake would you reveal the secret? For the father's? I think
he would not be much the better for the mother. For the mother's? I think
if she had done such a deed she would be safer where she was. For the daughter's?
I think it would hardly serve her, to establish her parentage for the information
of her husband, and to drag her back to disgrace, after an escape of twenty
years, pretty secure to last for life. But, add the case that you had loved
her, Pip, and had made her the subject of those "poor dreams" which have,
at one time or another, been in the heads of more men than you think likely,
then I tell you that you had better - and would much sooner when you had
thought well of it - chop off that bandaged left hand of yours with your
bandaged right hand, and then pass the chopper on to Wemmick there, to
cut <I>that</I> off, too.'

<P>I looked at Wemmick, whose face was very grave. He gravely touched his
lips with his forefinger. I did the same. Mr Jaggers did the same. `Now,
Wemmick,' said the latter then, resuming his usual manner, `what item was
it you were at, when Mr Pip came in?'

<P>Standing by for a little, while they were at work, I observed that the
odd looks they had cast at one another were repeated several times: with
this difference now, that each of them seemed suspicious, not to say conscious,
of having shown himself in a weak and unprofessional light to the other.
For this reason, I suppose, they were now inflexible with one another;
Mr Jaggers being highly dictatorial, and Wemmick obstinately justifying
himself whenever there was the smallest point in abeyance for a moment.
I had never seen them on such ill terms; for generally they got on very
well indeed together.

<P>But, they were both happily relieved by the opportune appearance of
Mike, the client with the fur cap and the habit of wiping his nose on his
sleeve, whom I had seen on the very first day of my appearance within those
walls. This individual, who, either in his own person or in that of some
member of his family, seemed to be always in trouble (which in that place
meant Newgate), called to announce that his eldest daughter was taken up
on suspicion of shop-lifting. As he imparted this melancholy circumstance
to Wemmick, Mr Jaggers standing magisterially before the fire and taking
no share in the proceedings, Mike's eye happened to twinkle with a tear.

<P>`What are you about?' demanded Wemmick, with the utmost indignation.
`What do you come snivelling here for?'

<P>`I didn't go to do it, Mr Wemmick.'

<P>`You did,' said Wemmick. `How dare you? You're not in a fit state to
come here, if you can't come here without spluttering like a bad pen. What
do you mean by it?'

<P>`A man can't help his feelings, Mr Wemmick,' pleaded Mike.

<P>`His what?' demanded Wemmick, quite savagely. `Say that again!'

<P>`Now, look here my man,' said Mr Jaggers, advancing a step, and pointing
to the door. `Get out of this office. I'll have no feelings here. Get out.'

<P>`It serves you right,' said Wemmick, `Get out.'

<P>So the unfortunate Mike very humbly withdrew, and Mr Jaggers and Wemmick
appeared to have re-established their good understanding, and went to work
again with an air of refreshment upon them as if they had just had lunch.
