Breaking the silence they had hitherto preserved, they raised a 

great cry as soon as they were ranged before the jail, and demanded 

to speak to the governor.  This visit was not wholly unexpected, 

for his house, which fronted the street, was strongly barricaded, 

the wicket-gate of the prison was closed up, and at no loophole or 

grating was any person to be seen.  Before they had repeated their 

summons many times, a man appeared upon the roof of the governor's 

house, and asked what it was they wanted.



Some said one thing, some another, and some only groaned and 

hissed.  It being now nearly dark, and the house high, many persons 

in the throng were not aware that any one had come to answer them, 

and continued their clamour until the intelligence was gradually 

diffused through the whole concourse.  Ten minutes or more elapsed 

before any one voice could be heard with tolerable distinctness; 

during which interval the figure remained perched alone, against 

the summer-evening sky, looking down into the troubled street.



'Are you,' said Hugh at length, 'Mr Akerman, the head jailer here?'



'Of course he is, brother,' whispered Dennis.  But Hugh, without 

minding him, took his answer from the man himself.



'Yes,' he said.  'I am.'



'You have got some friends of ours in your custody, master.'



'I have a good many people in my custody.'  He glanced downward, as 

he spoke, into the jail: and the feeling that he could see into 

the different yards, and that he overlooked everything which was 

hidden from their view by the rugged walls, so lashed and goaded 

the mob, that they howled like wolves.



'Deliver up our friends,' said Hugh, 'and you may keep the rest.'



'It's my duty to keep them all.  I shall do my duty.'



'If you don't throw the doors open, we shall break 'em down,' said 

Hugh; 'for we will have the rioters out.'



'All I can do, good people,' Akerman replied, 'is to exhort you to 

disperse; and to remind you that the consequences of any 

disturbance in this place, will be very severe, and bitterly 

repented by most of you, when it is too late.'



He made as though he would retire when he said these words, but he 

was checked by the voice of the locksmith.



'Mr Akerman,' cried Gabriel, 'Mr Akerman.'



'I will hear no more from any of you,' replied the governor, 

turning towards the speaker, and waving his hand.



'But I am not one of them,' said Gabriel.  'I am an honest man, 

Mr Akerman; a respectable tradesman--Gabriel Varden, the locksmith.  

You know me?' 



'You among the crowd!' cried the governor in an altered voice.



'Brought here by force--brought here to pick the lock of the great 

door for them,' rejoined the locksmith.  'Bear witness for me, Mr 

Akerman, that I refuse to do it; and that I will not do it, come 

what may of my refusal.  If any violence is done to me, please to 

remember this.'



'Is there no way (if helping you?' said the governor.



'None, Mr Akerman.  You'll do your duty, and I'll do mine.  Once 

again, you robbers and cut-throats,' said the locksmith, turning 

round upon them, 'I refuse.  Ah!  Howl till you're hoarse.  I 

refuse.'



'Stay--stay!' said the jailer, hastily.  'Mr Varden, I know you for 

a worthy man, and one who would do no unlawful act except upon 

compulsion--'



'Upon compulsion, sir,' interposed the locksmith, who felt that the 

tone in which this was said, conveyed the speaker's impression that 

he had ample excuse for yielding to the furious multitude who beset 

and hemmed him in, on every side, and among whom he stood, an old 

man, quite alone; 'upon compulsion, sir, I'll do nothing.'



'Where is that man,' said the keeper, anxiously, 'who spoke to me 

just now?'



'Here!' Hugh replied.



'Do you know what the guilt of murder is, and that by keeping that 

honest tradesman at your side you endanger his life!'



'We know it very well,' he answered, 'for what else did we bring 

him here?  Let's have our friends, master, and you shall have your 

friend.  Is that fair, lads?'



The mob replied to him with a loud Hurrah!



'You see how it is, sir?' cried Varden.  'Keep 'em out, in King 

George's name.  Remember what I have said.  Good night!'



There was no more parley.  A shower of stones and other missiles 

compelled the keeper of the jail to retire; and the mob, pressing 

on, and swarming round the walls, forced Gabriel Varden close up to 

the door.



In vain the basket of tools was laid upon the ground before him, 

and he was urged in turn by promises, by blows, by offers of 

reward, and threats of instant death, to do the office for which 

they had brought him there.  'No,' cried the sturdy locksmith, 'I 

will not!'



He had never loved his life so well as then, but nothing could move 

him.  The savage faces that glared upon him, look where he would; 

the cries of those who thirsted, like wild animals, for his blood; 

the sight of men pressing forward, and trampling down their 

fellows, as they strove to reach him, and struck at him above the 

heads of other men, with axes and with iron bars; all failed to 

daunt him.  He looked from man to man, and face to face, and still, 

with quickened breath and lessening colour, cried firmly, 'I will 

not!'



Dennis dealt him a blow upon the face which felled him to the 

ground.  He sprung up again like a man in the prime of life, and 

with blood upon his forehead, caught him by the throat.



'You cowardly dog!' he said: 'Give me my daughter.  Give me my 

daughter.'



They struggled together.  Some cried 'Kill him,' and some (but they 

were not near enough) strove to trample him to death.  Tug as he 

would at the old man's wrists, the hangman could not force him to 

unclench his hands.



'Is this all the return you make me, you ungrateful monster?' he 

articulated with great difficulty, and with many oaths.



'Give me my daughter!' cried the locksmith, who was now as fierce 

as those who gathered round him: 'Give me my daughter!'



He was down again, and up, and down once more, and buffeting with a 

score of them, who bandied him from hand to hand, when one tall 

fellow, fresh from a slaughter-house, whose dress and great thigh-

boots smoked hot with grease and blood, raised a pole-axe, and 

swearing a horrible oath, aimed it at the old man's uncovered head.  

At that instant, and in the very act, he fell himself, as if struck 

by lightning, and over his body a one-armed man came darting to the 

locksmith's side.  Another man was with him, and both caught the 

locksmith roughly in their grasp.



'Leave him to us!' they cried to Hugh--struggling, as they spoke, 

to force a passage backward through the crowd.  'Leave him to us.  

Why do you waste your whole strength on such as he, when a couple 

of men can finish him in as many minutes!  You lose time.  Remember 

the prisoners! remember Barnaby!'



The cry ran through the mob.  Hammers began to rattle on the walls; 

and every man strove to reach the prison, and be among the foremost 

rank.  Fighting their way through the press and struggle, as 

desperately as if they were in the midst of enemies rather than 

their own friends, the two men retreated with the locksmith between 

them, and dragged him through the very heart of the concourse.



And now the strokes began to fall like hail upon the gate, and on 

the strong building; for those who could not reach the door, spent 

their fierce rage on anything--even on the great blocks of stone, 

which shivered their weapons into fragments, and made their hands 

and arms to tingle as if the walls were active in their stout 

resistance, and dealt them back their blows.  The clash of iron 

ringing upon iron, mingled with the deafening tumult and sounded 

high above it, as the great sledge-hammers rattled on the nailed 

and plated door: the sparks flew off in showers; men worked in 

gangs, and at short intervals relieved each other, that all their 

strength might be devoted to the work; but there stood the portal 

still, as grim and dark and strong as ever, and, saving for the 

dints upon its battered surface, quite unchanged.



While some brought all their energies to bear upon this toilsome 

task; and some, rearing ladders against the prison, tried to 

clamber to the summit of the walls they were too short to scale; 

and some again engaged a body of police a hundred strong, and beat 

them back and trod them under foot by force of numbers; others 

besieged the house on which the jailer had appeared, and driving in 

the door, brought out his furniture, and piled it up against the 

prison-gate, to make a bonfire which should burn it down.  As soon 

as this device was understood, all those who had laboured hitherto, 

cast down their tools and helped to swell the heap; which reached 

half-way across the street, and was so high, that those who threw 

more fuel on the top, got up by ladders.  When all the keeper's 

goods were flung upon this costly pile, to the last fragment, they 

smeared it with the pitch, and tar, and rosin they had brought, and 

sprinkled it with turpentine.  To all the woodwork round the 

prison-doors they did the like, leaving not a joist or beam 

untouched.  This infernal christening performed, they fired the 

pile with lighted matches and with blazing tow, and then stood by, 

awaiting the result.



The furniture being very dry, and rendered more combustible by wax 

and oil, besides the arts they had used, took fire at once.  The 

flames roared high and fiercely, blackening the prison-wall, and 

twining up its loftly front like burning serpents.  At first they 

crowded round the blaze, and vented their exultation only in their 

looks: but when it grew hotter and fiercer--when it crackled, 

leaped, and roared, like a great furnace--when it shone upon the 

opposite houses, and lighted up not only the pale and wondering 

faces at the windows, but the inmost corners of each habitation--

when through the deep red heat and glow, the fire was seen sporting 

and toying with the door, now clinging to its obdurate surface, now 

gliding off with fierce inconstancy and soaring high into the sky, 

anon returning to fold it in its burning grasp and lure it to its 

ruin--when it shone and gleamed so brightly that the church clock 

of St Sepulchre's so often pointing to the hour of death, was 

legible as in broad day, and the vane upon its steeple-top 

glittered in the unwonted light like something richly jewelled--

when blackened stone and sombre brick grew ruddy in the deep 

reflection, and windows shone like burnished gold, dotting the 

longest distance in the fiery vista with their specks of 

brightness--when wall and tower, and roof and chimney-stack, seemed 

drunk, and in the flickering glare appeared to reel and stagger--

when scores of objects, never seen before, burst out upon the view, 

and things the most familiar put on some new aspect--then the mob 

began to join the whirl, and with loud yells, and shouts, and 

clamour, such as happily is seldom heard, bestirred themselves to 

feed the fire, and keep it at its height.



Although the heat was so intense that the paint on the houses over 

against the prison, parched and crackled up, and swelling into 

boils, as it were from excess of torture, broke and crumbled away; 

although the glass fell from the window-sashes, and the lead and 

iron on the roofs blistered the incautious hand that touched them, 

and the sparrows in the eaves took wing, and rendered giddy by the 

smoke, fell fluttering down upon the blazing pile; still the fire 

was tended unceasingly by busy hands, and round it, men were going 

always.  They never slackened in their zeal, or kept aloof, but 

pressed upon the flames so hard, that those in front had much ado 

to save themselves from being thrust in; if one man swooned or 

dropped, a dozen struggled for his place, and that although they 

knew the pain, and thirst, and pressure to be unendurable.  Those 

who fell down in fainting-fits, and were not crushed or burnt, 

were carried to an inn-yard close at hand, and dashed with water 

from a pump; of which buckets full were passed from man to man 

among the crowd; but such was the strong desire of all to drink, 

and such the fighting to be first, that, for the most part, the 

whole contents were spilled upon the ground, without the lips of 

one man being moistened.



Meanwhile, and in the midst of all the roar and outcry, those who 

were nearest to the pile, heaped up again the burning fragments 

that came toppling down, and raked the fire about the door, which, 

although a sheet of flame, was still a door fast locked and barred, 

and kept them out.  Great pieces of blazing wood were passed, 

besides, above the people's heads to such as stood about the 

ladders, and some of these, climbing up to the topmost stave, and 

holding on with one hand by the prison wall, exerted all their 

skill and force to cast these fire-brands on the roof, or down into 

the yards within.  In many instances their efforts were successful; 

which occasioned a new and appalling addition to the horrors of the 

scene: for the prisoners within, seeing from between their bars 

that the fire caught in many places and thrived fiercely, and being 

all locked up in strong cells for the night, began to know that 

they were in danger of being burnt alive.  This terrible fear, 

spreading from cell to cell and from yard to yard, vented itself in 

such dismal cries and wailings, and in such dreadful shrieks for 

help, that the whole jail resounded with the noise; which was 

loudly heard even above the shouting of the mob and roaring of the 

flames, and was so full of agony and despair, that it made the 

boldest tremble.



It was remarkable that these cries began in that quarter of the 

jail which fronted Newgate Street, where, it was well known, the 

men who were to suffer death on Thursday were confined.  And not 

only were these four who had so short a time to live, the first to 

whom the dread of being burnt occurred, but they were, throughout, 

the most importunate of all: for they could be plainly heard, 

notwithstanding the great thickness of the walls, crying that the 

wind set that way, and that the flames would shortly reach them; 

and calling to the officers of the jail to come and quench the 

fire from a cistern which was in their yard, and full of water.  

Judging from what the crowd outside the walls could hear from time 

to time, these four doomed wretches never ceased to call for help; 

and that with as much distraction, and in as great a frenzy of 

attachment to existence, as though each had an honoured, happy 

life before him, instead of eight-and-forty hours of miserable 

imprisonment, and then a violent and shameful death.



But the anguish and suffering of the two sons of one of these men, 

when they heard, or fancied that they heard, their father's voice, 

is past description.  After wringing their hands and rushing to and 

fro as if they were stark mad, one mounted on the shoulders of his 

brother, and tried to clamber up the face of the high wall, guarded 

at the top with spikes and points of iron.  And when he fell among 

the crowd, he was not deterred by his bruises, but mounted up 

again, and fell again, and, when he found the feat impossible, 

began to beat the stones and tear them with his hands, as if he 

could that way make a breach in the strong building, and force a 

passage in.  At last, they cleft their way among the mob about the 

door, though many men, a dozen times their match, had tried in vain 

to do so, and were seen, in--yes, in--the fire, striving to prize 

it down, with crowbars.



Nor were they alone affected by the outcry from within the prison.  

The women who were looking on, shrieked loudly, beat their hands 

together, stopped their ears; and many fainted: the men who were 

not near the walls and active in the siege, rather than do nothing, 

tore up the pavement of the street, and did so with a haste and 

fury they could not have surpassed if that had been the jail, and 

they were near their object.  Not one living creature in the throng 

was for an instant still.  The whole great mass were mad.



A shout!  Another!  Another yet, though few knew why, or what it 

meant.  But those around the gate had seen it slowly yield, and 

drop from its topmost hinge.  It hung on that side by but one, but 

it was upright still, because of the bar, and its having sunk, of 

its own weight, into the heap of ashes at its foot.  There was now 

a gap at the top of the doorway, through which could be descried a 

gloomy passage, cavernous and dark.  Pile up the fire!



It burnt fiercely.  The door was red-hot, and the gap wider.  They 

vainly tried to shield their faces with their hands, and standing 

as if in readiness for a spring, watched the place.  Dark figures, 

some crawling on their hands and knees, some carried in the arms of 

others, were seen to pass along the roof.  It was plain the jail 

could hold out no longer.  The keeper, and his officers, and their 

wives and children, were escaping.  Pile up the fire!



The door sank down again: it settled deeper in the cinders--

tottered--yielded--was down!



As they shouted again, they fell back, for a moment, and left a 

clear space about the fire that lay between them and the jail 

entry.  Hugh leapt upon the blazing heap, and scattering a train of 

sparks into the air, and making the dark lobby glitter with those 

that hung upon his dress, dashed into the jail.



The hangman followed.  And then so many rushed upon their track, 

that the fire got trodden down and thinly strewn about the street; 

but there was no need of it now, for, inside and out, the prison 

was in flames.
