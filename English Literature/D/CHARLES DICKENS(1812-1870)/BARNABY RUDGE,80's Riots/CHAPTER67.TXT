When darkness broke away and morning began to dawn, the town wore a 

strange aspect indeed.



Sleep had hardly been thought of all night.  The general alarm was 

so apparent in the faces of the inhabitants, and its expression was 

so aggravated by want of rest (few persons, with any property to 

lose, having dared go to bed since Monday), that a stranger coming 

into the streets would have supposed some mortal pest or plague to 

have been raging.  In place of the usual cheerfulness and animation 

of morning, everything was dead and silent.  The shops remained 

closed, offices and warehouses were shut, the coach and chair 

stands were deserted, no carts or waggons rumbled through the 

slowly waking streets, the early cries were all hushed; a universal 

gloom prevailed.  Great numbers of people were out, even at 

daybreak, but they flitted to and fro as though they shrank from 

the sound of their own footsteps; the public ways were haunted 

rather than frequented; and round the smoking ruins people stood 

apart from one another and in silence, not venturing to condemn 

the rioters, or to be supposed to do so, even in whispers.



At the Lord President's in Piccadilly, at Lambeth Palace, at the 

Lord Chancellor's in Great Ormond Street, in the Royal Exchange, 

the Bank, the Guildhall, the Inns of Court, the Courts of Law, and 

every chamber fronting the streets near Westminster Hall and the 

Houses of Parliament, parties of soldiers were posted before 

daylight.  A body of Horse Guards paraded Palace Yard; an 

encampment was formed in the Park, where fifteen hundred men and 

five battalions of Militia were under arms; the Tower was 

fortified, the drawbridges were raised, the cannon loaded and 

pointed, and two regiments of artillery busied in strengthening the 

fortress and preparing it for defence.  A numerous detachment of 

soldiers were stationed to keep guard at the New River Head, which 

the people had threatened to attack, and where, it was said, they 

meant to cut off the main-pipes, so that there might be no water 

for the extinction of the flames.  In the Poultry, and on Cornhill, 

and at several other leading points, iron chains were drawn across 

the street; parties of soldiers were distributed in some of the old 

city churches while it was yet dark; and in several private houses 

(among them, Lord Rockingham's in Grosvenor Square); which were 

blockaded as though to sustain a siege, and had guns pointed from 

the windows.  When the sun rose, it shone into handsome apartments 

filled with armed men; the furniture hastily heaped away in 

corners, and made of little or no account, in the terror of the 

time--on arms glittering in city chambers, among desks and stools, 

and dusty books--into little smoky churchyards in odd lanes and by-

ways, with soldiers lying down among the tombs, or lounging under 

the shade of the one old tree, and their pile of muskets sparkling 

in the light--on solitary sentries pacing up and down in 

courtyards, silent now, but yesterday resounding with the din and 

hum of business--everywhere on guard-rooms, garrisons, and 

threatening preparations.



As the day crept on, still more unusual sights were witnessed in 

the streets.  The gates of the King's Bench and Fleet Prisons 

being opened at the usual hour, were found to have notices affixed 

to them, announcing that the rioters would come that night to burn 

them down.  The wardens, too well knowing the likelihood there was 

of this promise being fulfilled, were fain to set their prisoners 

at liberty, and give them leave to move their goods; so, all day, 

such of them as had any furniture were occupied in conveying it, 

some to this place, some to that, and not a few to the brokers' 

shops, where they gladly sold it, for any wretched price those 

gentry chose to give.  There were some broken men among these 

debtors who had been in jail so long, and were so miserable and 

destitute of friends, so dead to the world, and utterly forgotten 

and uncared for, that they implored their jailers not to set them 

free, and to send them, if need were, to some other place of 

custody.  But they, refusing to comply, lest they should incur the 

anger of the mob, turned them into the streets, where they wandered 

up and down hardly remembering the ways untrodden by their feet so 

long, and crying--such abject things those rotten-hearted jails had 

made them--as they slunk off in their rags, and dragged their 

slipshod feet along the pavement.



Even of the three hundred prisoners who had escaped from Newgate, 

there were some--a few, but there were some--who sought their 

jailers out and delivered themselves up: preferring imprisonment 

and punishment to the horrors of such another night as the last.  

Many of the convicts, drawn back to their old place of captivity by 

some indescribable attraction, or by a desire to exult over it in 

its downfall and glut their revenge by seeing it in ashes, actually 

went back in broad noon, and loitered about the cells.  Fifty were 

retaken at one time on this next day, within the prison walls; but 

their fate did not deter others, for there they went in spite of 

everything, and there they were taken in twos and threes, twice or 

thrice a day, all through the week.  Of the fifty just mentioned, 

some were occupied in endeavouring to rekindle the fire; but in 

general they seemed to have no object in view but to prowl and 

lounge about the old place: being often found asleep in the ruins, 

or sitting talking there, or even eating and drinking, as in a 

choice retreat.



Besides the notices on the gates of the Fleet and the King's Bench, 

many similar announcements were left, before one o'clock at noon, 

at the houses of private individuals; and further, the mob 

proclaimed their intention of seizing on the Bank, the Mint, the 

Arsenal at Woolwich, and the Royal Palaces.  The notices were 

seldom delivered by more than one man, who, if it were at a shop, 

went in, and laid it, with a bloody threat perhaps, upon the 

counter; or if it were at a private house, knocked at the door, and 

thrust it in the servant's hand.  Notwithstanding the presence of 

the military in every quarter of the town, and the great force in 

the Park, these messengers did their errands with impunity all 

through the day.  So did two boys who went down Holborn alone, 

armed with bars taken from the railings of Lord Mansfield's house, 

and demanded money for the rioters.  So did a tall man on horseback 

who made a collection for the same purpose in Fleet Street, and 

refused to take anything but gold.



A rumour had now got into circulation, too, which diffused a 

greater dread all through London, even than these publicly 

announced intentions of the rioters, though all men knew that if 

they were successfully effected, there must ensue a national 

bankruptcy and general ruin.  It was said that they meant to throw 

the gates of Bedlam open, and let all the madmen loose.  This 

suggested such dreadful images to the people's minds, and was 

indeed an act so fraught with new and unimaginable horrors in the 

contemplation, that it beset them more than any loss or cruelty of 

which they could foresee the worst, and drove many sane men nearly 

mad themselves.



So the day passed on: the prisoners moving their goods; people 

running to and fro in the streets, carrying away their property; 

groups standing in silence round the ruins; all business suspended; 

and the soldiers disposed as has been already mentioned, remaining 

quite inactive.  So the day passed on, and dreaded night drew near 

again.



At last, at seven o'clock in the evening, the Privy Council issued 

a solemn proclamation that it was now necessary to employ the 

military, and that the officers had most direct and effectual 

orders, by an immediate exertion of their utmost force, to repress 

the disturbances; and warning all good subjects of the King to keep 

themselves, their servants, and apprentices, within doors that 

night.  There was then delivered out to every soldier on duty, 

thirty-six rounds of powder and ball; the drums beat; and the whole 

force was under arms at sunset.



The City authorities, stimulated by these vigorous measures, held a 

Common Council; passed a vote thanking the military associations 

who had tendered their aid to the civil authorities; accepted it; 

and placed them under the direction of the two sheriffs.  At the 

Queen's palace, a double guard, the yeomen on duty, the groom-

porters, and all other attendants, were stationed in the passages 

and on the staircases at seven o'clock, with strict instructions to 

be watchful on their posts all night; and all the doors were 

locked.  The gentlemen of the Temple, and the other Inns, mounted 

guard within their gates, and strengthened them with the great 

stones of the pavement, which they took up for the purpose.  In 

Lincoln's Inn, they gave up the hall and commons to the 

Northumberland Militia, under the command of Lord Algernon Percy; 

in some few of the city wards, the burgesses turned out, and 

without making a very fierce show, looked brave enough.  Some 

hundreds of stout gentlemen threw themselves, armed to the teeth, 

into the halls of the different companies, double-locked and bolted 

all the gates, and dared the rioters (among themselves) to come on 

at their peril.  These arrangements being all made simultaneously, 

or nearly so, were completed by the time it got dark; and then the 

streets were comparatively clear, and were guarded at all the great 

corners and chief avenues by the troops: while parties of the 

officers rode up and down in all directions, ordering chance 

stragglers home, and admonishing the residents to keep within their 

houses, and, if any firing ensued, not to approach the windows.  

More chains were drawn across such of the thoroughfares as were of 

a nature to favour the approach of a great crowd, and at each of 

these points a considerable force was stationed.  All these 

precautions having been taken, and it being now quite dark, those 

in command awaited the result in some anxiety: and not without a 

hope that such vigilant demonstrations might of themselves 

dishearten the populace, and prevent any new outrages.



But in this reckoning they were cruelly mistaken, for in half an 

hour, or less, as though the setting in of night had been their 

preconcerted signal, the rioters having previously, in small 

parties, prevented the lighting of the street lamps, rose like a 

great sea; and that in so many places at once, and with such 

inconceivable fury, that those who had the direction of the troops 

knew not, at first, where to turn or what to do.  One after 

another, new fires blazed up in every quarter of the town, as 

though it were the intention of the insurgents to wrap the city in 

a circle of flames, which, contracting by degrees, should burn the 

whole to ashes; the crowd swarmed and roared in every street; and 

none but rioters and soldiers being out of doors, it seemed to the 

latter as if all London were arrayed against them, and they stood 

alone against the town.



In two hours, six-and-thirty fires were raging--six-and-thirty 

great conflagrations: among them the Borough Clink in Tooley 

Street, the King's Bench, the Fleet, and the New Bridewell.  In 

almost every street, there was a battle; and in every quarter the 

muskets of the troops were heard above the shouts and tumult of the 

mob.  The firing began in the Poultry, where the chain was drawn 

across the road, where nearly a score of people were killed on the 

first discharge.  Their bodies having been hastily carried into St 

Mildred's Church by the soldiers, the latter fired again, and 

following fast upon the crowd, who began to give way when they saw 

the execution that was done, formed across Cheapside, and charged 

them at the point of the bayonet.



The streets were now a dreadful spectacle.  The shouts of the 

rabble, the shrieks of women, the cries of the wounded, and the 

constant firing, formed a deafening and an awful accompaniment to 

the sights which every corner presented.  Wherever the road was 

obstructed by the chains, there the fighting and the loss of life 

were greatest; but there was hot work and bloodshed in almost every 

leading thoroughfare.



At Holborn Bridge, and on Holborn Hill, the confusion was greater 

than in any other part; for the crowd that poured out of the city 

in two great streams, one by Ludgate Hill, and one by Newgate 

Street, united at that spot, and formed a mass so dense, that at 

every volley the people seemed to fall in heaps.  At this place a 

large detachment of soldiery were posted, who fired, now up Fleet 

Market, now up Holborn, now up Snow Hill--constantly raking the 

streets in each direction.  At this place too, several large fires 

were burning, so that all the terrors of that terrible night seemed 

to be concentrated in one spot.



Full twenty times, the rioters, headed by one man who wielded an 

axe in his right hand, and bestrode a brewer's horse of great size 

and strength, caparisoned with fetters taken out of Newgate, which 

clanked and jingled as he went, made an attempt to force a passage 

at this point, and fire the vintner's house.  Full twenty times 

they were repulsed with loss of life, and still came back again; 

and though the fellow at their head was marked and singled out by 

all, and was a conspicuous object as the only rioter on horseback, 

not a man could hit him.  So surely as the smoke cleared away, so 

surely there was he; calling hoarsely to his companions, 

brandishing his axe above his head, and dashing on as though he 

bore a charmed life, and was proof against ball and powder.



This man was Hugh; and in every part of the riot, he was seen.  He 

headed two attacks upon the Bank, helped to break open the Toll-

houses on Blackfriars Bridge, and cast the money into the street: 

fired two of the prisons with his own hand: was here, and there, 

and everywhere--always foremost--always active--striking at the 

soldiers, cheering on the crowd, making his horse's iron music 

heard through all the yell and uproar: but never hurt or stopped.  

Turn him at one place, and he made a new struggle in anotlter; 

force him to retreat at this point, and he advanced on that, 

directly.  Driven from Holborn for the twentieth time, he rode at 

the head of a great crowd straight upon Saint Paul's, attacked a 

guard of soldiers who kept watch over a body of prisoners within 

the iron railings, forced them to retreat, rescued the men they had 

in custody, and with this accession to his party, came back again, 

mad with liquor and excitement, and hallooing them on like a 

demon.



It would have been no easy task for the most careful rider to sit a 

horse in the midst of such a throng and tumult; but though this 

madman rolled upon his back (he had no saddle) like a boat upon the 

sea, he never for an instant lost his seat, or failed to guide him 

where he would.  Through the very thickest of the press, over dead 

bodies and burning fragments, now on the pavement, now in the road, 

now riding up a flight of steps to make himself the more 

conspicuous to his party, and now forcing a passage through a mass 

of human beings, so closely squeezed together that it seemed as if 

the edge of a knife would scarcely part them,--on he went, as 

though he could surmount all obstacles by the mere exercise of his 

will.  And perhaps his not being shot was in some degree 

attributable to this very circumstance; for his extreme audacity, 

and the conviction that he must be one of those to whom the 

proclamation referred, inspired the soldiers with a desire to take 

him alive, and diverted many an aim which otherwise might have been 

more near the mark.



The vintner and Mr Haredale, unable to sit quietly listening to the 

noise without seeing what went on, had climbed to the roof of the 

house, and hiding behind a stack of chimneys, were looking 

cautiously down into the street, almost hoping that after so many 

repulses the rioters would be foiled, when a great shout proclaimed 

that a parry were coming round the other way; and the dismal 

jingling of those accursed fetters warned them next moment that 

they too were led by Hugh.  The soldiers had advanced into Fleet 

Market and were dispersing the people there; so that they came on 

with hardly any check, and were soon before the house.



'All's over now,' said the vintner.  'Fifty thousand pounds will be 

scattered in a minute.  We must save ourselves.  We can do no 

more, and shall have reason to be thankful if we do as much.'



Their first impulse was, to clamber along the roofs of the houses, 

and, knocking at some garret window for admission, pass down that 

way into the street, and so escape.  But another fierce cry from 

below, and a general upturning of the faces of the crowd, apprised 

them that they were discovered, and even that Mr Haredale was 

recognised; for Hugh, seeing him plainly in the bright glare of 

the fire, which in that part made it as light as day, called to him 

by his name, and swore to have his life.



'Leave me here,' said Mr Haredale, 'and in Heaven's name, my good 

friend, save yourself!  Come on!' he muttered, as he turned towards 

Hugh and faced him without any further effort at concealment: 'This 

roof is high, and if we close, we will die together!'



'Madness,' said the honest vintner, pulling him back, 'sheer 

madness.  Hear reason, sir.  My good sir, hear reason.  I could 

never make myself heard by knocking at a window now; and even if I 

could, no one would be bold enough to connive at my escape.  

Through the cellars, there's a kind of passage into the back street 

by which we roll casks in and out.  We shall have time to get down 

there before they can force an entry.  Do not delay an instant, but 

come with me--for both our sakes--for mine--my dear good sir!'



As he spoke, and drew Mr Haredale back, they had both a glimpse of 

the street.  It was but a glimpse, but it showed them the crowd, 

gathering and clustering round the house: some of the armed men 

pressing to the front to break down the doors and windows, some 

bringing brands from the nearest fire, some with lifted faces 

following their course upon the roof and pointing them out to their 

companions: all raging and roaring like the flames they lighted up.  

They saw some men thirsting for the treasures of strong liquor 

which they knew were stored within; they saw others, who had been 

wounded, sinking down into the opposite doorways and dying, 

solitary wretches, in the midst of all the vast assemblage; here a 

frightened woman trying to escape; and there a lost child; and 

there a drunken ruffian, unconscious of the death-wound on his 

head, raving and fighting to the last.  All these things, and even 

such trivial incidents as a man with his hat off, or turning round, 

or stooping down, or shaking hands with another, they marked 

distinctly; yet in a glance so brief, that, in the act of stepping 

back, they lost the whole, and saw but the pale faces of each 

other, and the red sky above them.



Mr Haredale yielded to the entreaties of his companion--more 

because he was resolved to defend him, than for any thought he had 

of his own life, or any care he entertained for his own safety--and 

quickly re-entering the house, they descended the stairs together.  

Loud blows were thundering on the shutters, crowbars were already 

thrust beneath the door, the glass fell from the sashes, a deep 

light shone through every crevice, and they heard the voices of the 

foremost in the crowd so close to every chink and keyhole, that 

they seemed to be hoarsely whispering their threats into their very 

ears.  They had but a moment reached the bottom of the cellar-steps 

and shut the door behind them, when the mob broke in.



The vaults were profoundly dark, and having no torch or candle--for 

they had been afraid to carry one, lest it should betray their 

place of refuge--they were obliged to grope with their hands.  But 

they were not long without light, for they had not gone far when 

they heard the crowd forcing the door; and, looking back among the 

low-arched passages, could see them in the distance, hurrying to 

and fro with flashing links, broaching the casks, staving the great 

vats, turning off upon the right hand and the left, into the 

different cellars, and lying down to drink at the channels of 

strong spirits which were already flowing on the ground.



They hurried on, not the less quickly for this; and had reached the 

only vault which lay between them and the passage out, when 

suddenly, from the direction in which they were going, a strong 

light gleamed upon their faces; and before they could slip aside, 

or turn back, or hide themselves, two men (one bearing a torch) 

came upon them, and cried in an astonished whisper, 'Here they 

are!'



At the same instant they pulled off what they wore upon their 

heads.  Mr Haredale saw before him Edward Chester, and then saw, 

when the vintner gasped his name, Joe Willet.



Ay, the same Joe, though with an arm the less, who used to make the 

quarterly journey on the grey mare to pay the bill to the purple-

faced vintner; and that very same purple-faced vintner, formerly 

of Thames Street, now looked him in the face, and challenged him by 

name.



'Give me your hand,' said Joe softly, taking it whether the 

astonished vintner would or no.  'Don't fear to shake it; it's a 

friendly one and a hearty one, though it has no fellow.  Why, how 

well you look and how bluff you are!  And you--God bless you, sir.  

Take heart, take heart.  We'll find them.  Be of good cheer; we 

have not been idle.'



There was something so honest and frank in Joe's speech, that Mr 

Haredale put his hand in his involuntarily, though their meeting 

was suspicious enough.  But his glance at Edward Chester, and that 

gentleman's keeping aloof, were not lost upon Joe, who said 

bluntly, glancing at Edward while he spoke:



'Times are changed, Mr Haredale, and times have come when we ought 

to know friends from enemies, and make no confusion of names.  Let 

me tell you that but for this gentleman, you would most likely 

have been dead by this time, or badly wounded at the best.'



'What do you say?' cried Mr Haredale.



'I say,' said Joe, 'first, that it was a bold thing to be in the 

crowd at all disguised as one of them; though I won't say much 

about that, on second thoughts, for that's my case too.  Secondly, 

that it was a brave and glorious action--that's what I call it--to 

strike that fellow off his horse before their eyes!'



'What fellow!  Whose eyes!'



'What fellow, sir!' cried Joe: 'a fellow who has no goodwill to 

you, and who has the daring and devilry in him of twenty fellows.  

I know him of old.  Once in the house, HE would have found you, 

here or anywhere.  The rest owe you no particular grudge, and, 

unless they see you, will only think of drinking themselves dead.  

But we lose time.  Are you ready?'



'Quite,' said Edward.  'Put out the torch, Joe, and go on.  And be 

silent, there's a good fellow.'



'Silent or not silent,' murmured Joe, as he dropped the flaring 

link upon the ground, crushed it with his foot, and gave his hand 

to Mr Haredale, 'it was a brave and glorious action;--no man can 

alter that.'



Both Mr Haredale and the worthy vintner were too amazed and too 

much hurried to ask any further questions, so followed their 

conductors in silence.  It seemed, from a short whispering which 

presently ensued between them and the vintner relative to the best 

way of escape, that they had entered by the back-door, with the 

connivance of John Grueby, who watched outside with the key in his 

pocket, and whom they had taken into their confidence.  A party of 

the crowd coming up that way, just as they entered, John had 

double-locked the door again, and made off for the soldiers, so 

that means of retreat was cut off from under them.



However, as the front-door had been forced, and this minor crowd, 

being anxious to get at the liquor, had no fancy for losing time in 

breaking down another, but had gone round and got in from Holborn 

with the rest, the narrow lane in the rear was quite free of 

people.  So, when they had crawled through the passage indicated by 

the vintner (which was a mere shelving-trap for the admission of 

casks), and had managed with some difficulty to unchain and raise 

the door at the upper end, they emerged into the street without 

being observed or interrupted.  Joe still holding Mr Haredale 

tight, and Edward taking the same care of the vintner, they hurried 

through the streets at a rapid pace; occasionally standing aside to 

let some fugitives go by, or to keep out of the way of the soldiers 

who followed them, and whose questions, when they halted to put 

any, were speedily stopped by one whispered word from Joe.
