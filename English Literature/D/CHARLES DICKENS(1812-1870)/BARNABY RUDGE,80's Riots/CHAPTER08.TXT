Clear of the locksmith's house, Sim Tappertit laid aside his 

cautious manner, and assuming in its stead that of a ruffling, 

swaggering, roving blade, who would rather kill a man than 

otherwise, and eat him too if needful, made the best of his way 

along the darkened streets.



Half pausing for an instant now and then to smite his pocket and 

assure himself of the safety of his master key, he hurried on to 

Barbican, and turning into one of the narrowest of the narrow 

streets which diverged from that centre, slackened his pace and 

wiped his heated brow, as if the termination of his walk were near 

at hand.



It was not a very choice spot for midnight expeditions, being in 

truth one of more than questionable character, and of an appearance 

by no means inviting.  From the main street he had entered, itself 

little better than an alley, a low-browed doorway led into a blind 

court, or yard, profoundly dark, unpaved, and reeking with stagnant 

odours.  Into this ill-favoured pit, the locksmith's vagrant 

'prentice groped his way; and stopping at a house from whose 

defaced and rotten front the rude effigy of a bottle swung to and 

fro like some gibbeted malefactor, struck thrice upon an iron 

grating with his foot.  After listening in vain for some response 

to his signal, Mr Tappertit became impatient, and struck the 

grating thrice again.



A further delay ensued, but it was not of long duration.  The 

ground seemed to open at his feet, and a ragged head appeared.



'Is that the captain?' said a voice as ragged as the head.



'Yes,' replied Mr Tappertit haughtily, descending as he spoke, 'who 

should it be?'



'It's so late, we gave you up,' returned the voice, as its owner 

stopped to shut and fasten the grating.  'You're late, sir.'



'Lead on,' said Mr Tappertit, with a gloomy majesty, 'and make 

remarks when I require you.  Forward!'



This latter word of command was perhaps somewhat theatrical and 

unnecessary, inasmuch as the descent was by a very narrow, steep, 

and slippery flight of steps, and any rashness or departure from 

the beaten track must have ended in a yawning water-butt.  But Mr 

Tappertit being, like some other great commanders, favourable to 

strong effects, and personal display, cried 'Forward!' again, in 

the hoarsest voice he could assume; and led the way, with folded 

arms and knitted brows, to the cellar down below, where there was a 

small copper fixed in one corner, a chair or two, a form and table, 

a glimmering fire, and a truckle-bed, covered with a ragged 

patchwork rug.



'Welcome, noble captain!' cried a lanky figure, rising as from a 

nap.



The captain nodded.  Then, throwing off his outer coat, he stood 

composed in all his dignity, and eyed his follower over.



'What news to-night?' he asked, when he had looked into his very 

soul.



'Nothing particular,' replied the other, stretching himself--and he 

was so long already that it was quite alarming to see him do it--

'how come you to be so late?'



'No matter,' was all the captain deigned to say in answer.  'Is the 

room prepared?'



'It is,' replied the follower.



'The comrade--is he here?'



'Yes.  And a sprinkling of the others--you hear 'em?'



'Playing skittles!' said the captain moodily.  'Light-hearted 

revellers!'



There was no doubt respecting the particular amusement in which 

these heedless spirits were indulging, for even in the close and 

stifling atmosphere of the vault, the noise sounded like distant 

thunder.  It certainly appeared, at first sight, a singular spot to 

choose, for that or any other purpose of relaxation, if the other 

cellars answered to the one in which this brief colloquy took 

place; for the floors were of sodden earth, the walls and roof of 

damp bare brick tapestried with the tracks of snails and slugs; the 

air was sickening, tainted, and offensive.  It seemed, from one 

strong flavour which was uppermost among the various odours of the 

place, that it had, at no very distant period, been used as a 

storehouse for cheeses; a circumstance which, while it accounted 

for the greasy moisture that hung about it, was agreeably 

suggestive of rats.  It was naturally damp besides, and little 

trees of fungus sprung from every mouldering corner.



The proprietor of this charming retreat, and owner of the ragged 

head before mentioned--for he wore an old tie-wig as bare and 

frowzy as a stunted hearth-broom--had by this time joined them; and 

stood a little apart, rubbing his hands, wagging his hoary bristled 

chin, and smiling in silence.  His eyes were closed; but had they 

been wide open, it would have been easy to tell, from the attentive 

expression of the face he turned towards them--pale and unwholesome 

as might be expected in one of his underground existence--and from 

a certain anxious raising and quivering of the lids, that he was 

blind.



'Even Stagg hath been asleep,' said the long comrade, nodding 

towards this person.



'Sound, captain, sound!' cried the blind man; 'what does my noble 

captain drink--is it brandy, rum, usquebaugh?  Is it soaked 

gunpowder, or blazing oil?  Give it a name, heart of oak, and we'd 

get it for you, if it was wine from a bishop's cellar, or melted 

gold from King George's mint.'



'See,' said Mr Tappertit haughtily, 'that it's something strong, 

and comes quick; and so long as you take care of that, you may 

bring it from the devil's cellar, if you like.'



'Boldly said, noble captain!' rejoined the blind man.  'Spoken like 

the 'Prentices' Glory.  Ha, ha!  From the devil's cellar!  A brave 

joke!  The captain joketh.  Ha, ha, ha!'



'I'll tell you what, my fine feller,' said Mr Tappertit, eyeing the 

host over as he walked to a closet, and took out a bottle and glass 

as carelessly as if he had been in full possession of his sight, 

'if you make that row, you'll find that the captain's very far from 

joking, and so I tell you.'



'He's got his eyes on me!' cried Stagg, stopping short on his way 

back, and affecting to screen his face with the bottle.  'I feel 

'em though I can't see 'em.  Take 'em off, noble captain.  Remove 

'em, for they pierce like gimlets.'



Mr Tappertit smiled grimly at his comrade; and twisting out one 

more look--a kind of ocular screw--under the influence of which the 

blind man feigned to undergo great anguish and torture, bade him, 

in a softened tone, approach, and hold his peace.



'I obey you, captain,' cried Stagg, drawing close to him and 

filling out a bumper without spilling a drop, by reason that he 

held his little finger at the brim of the glass, and stopped at the 

instant the liquor touched it, 'drink, noble governor.  Death to 

all masters, life to all 'prentices, and love to all fair damsels.  

Drink, brave general, and warm your gallant heart!'



Mr Tappertit condescended to take the glass from his outstretched 

hand.  Stagg then dropped on one knee, and gently smoothed the 

calves of his legs, with an air of humble admiration.



'That I had but eyes!' he cried, 'to behold my captain's 

symmetrical proportions!  That I had but eyes, to look upon these 

twin invaders of domestic peace!'



'Get out!' said Mr Tappertit, glancing downward at his favourite 

limbs.  'Go along, will you, Stagg!'



'When I touch my own afterwards,' cried the host, smiting them 

reproachfully, 'I hate 'em.  Comparatively speaking, they've no 

more shape than wooden legs, beside these models of my noble 

captain's.'



'Yours!' exclaimed Mr Tappertit.  'No, I should think not.  Don't 

talk about those precious old toothpicks in the same breath with 

mine; that's rather too much.  Here.  Take the glass.  Benjamin.  

Lead on.  To business!'



With these words, he folded his arms again; and frowning with a 

sullen majesty, passed with his companion through a little door at 

the upper end of the cellar, and disappeared; leaving Stagg to his 

private meditations.



The vault they entered, strewn with sawdust and dimly lighted, was 

between the outer one from which they had just come, and that in 

which the skittle-players were diverting themselves; as was 

manifested by the increased noise and clamour of tongues, which was 

suddenly stopped, however, and replaced by a dead silence, at a 

signal from the long comrade.  Then, this young gentleman, going to 

a little cupboard, returned with a thigh-bone, which in former 

times must have been part and parcel of some individual at least as 

long as himself, and placed the same in the hands of Mr Tappertit; 

who, receiving it as a sceptre and staff of authority, cocked his 

three-cornered hat fiercely on the top of his head, and mounted a 

large table, whereon a chair of state, cheerfully ornamented with a 

couple of skulls, was placed ready for his reception.



He had no sooner assumed this position, than another young 

gentleman appeared, bearing in his arms a huge clasped book, who 

made him a profound obeisance, and delivering it to the long 

comrade, advanced to the table, and turning his back upon it, stood 

there Atlas-wise.  Then, the long comrade got upon the table too; 

and seating himself in a lower chair than Mr Tappertit's, with much 

state and ceremony, placed the large book on the shoulders of their 

mute companion as deliberately as if he had been a wooden desk, and 

prepared to make entries therein with a pen of corresponding size.



When the long comrade had made these preparations, he looked 

towards Mr Tappertit; and Mr Tappertit, flourishing the bone, 

knocked nine times therewith upon one of the skulls.  At the ninth 

stroke, a third young gentleman emerged from the door leading to 

the skittle ground, and bowing low, awaited his commands.



'Prentice!' said the mighty captain, 'who waits without?'



The 'prentice made answer that a stranger was in attendance, who 

claimed admission into that secret society of 'Prentice Knights, 

and a free participation in their rights, privileges, and 

immunities.  Thereupon Mr Tappertit flourished the bone again, and 

giving the other skull a prodigious rap on the nose, exclaimed 

'Admit him!'  At these dread words the 'prentice bowed once more, 

and so withdrew as he had come.



There soon appeared at the same door, two other 'prentices, having 

between them a third, whose eyes were bandaged, and who was attired 

in a bag-wig, and a broad-skirted coat, trimmed with tarnished 

lace; and who was girded with a sword, in compliance with the laws 

of the Institution regulating the introduction of candidates, which 

required them to assume this courtly dress, and kept it constantly 

in lavender, for their convenience.  One of the conductors of this 

novice held a rusty blunderbuss pointed towards his ear, and the 

other a very ancient sabre, with which he carved imaginary 

offenders as he came along in a sanguinary and anatomical manner.



As this silent group advanced, Mr Tappertit fixed his hat upon his 

head.  The novice then laid his hand upon his breast and bent 

before him.  When he had humbled himself sufficiently, the captain 

ordered the bandage to be removed, and proceeded to eye him over.



'Ha!' said the captain, thoughtfully, when he had concluded this 

ordeal.  'Proceed.'



The long comrade read aloud as follows:--'Mark Gilbert.  Age, 

nineteen.  Bound to Thomas Curzon, hosier, Golden Fleece, Aldgate.  

Loves Curzon's daughter.  Cannot say that Curzon's daughter loves 

him.  Should think it probable.  Curzon pulled his ears last 

Tuesday week.'



'How!' cried the captain, starting.



'For looking at his daughter, please you,' said the novice.



'Write Curzon down, Denounced,' said the captain.  'Put a black 

cross against the name of Curzon.'



'So please you,' said the novice, 'that's not the worst--he calls 

his 'prentice idle dog, and stops his beer unless he works to his 

liking.  He gives Dutch cheese, too, eating Cheshire, sir, himself; 

and Sundays out, are only once a month.'



'This,' said Mr Tappert;t gravely, 'is a flagrant case.  Put two 

black crosses to the name of Curzon.'



'If the society,' said the novice, who was an ill-looking, one-

sided, shambling lad, with sunken eyes set close together in his 

head--'if the society would burn his house down--for he's not 

insured--or beat him as he comes home from his club at night, or 

help me to carry off his daughter, and marry her at the Fleet, 

whether she gave consent or no--'



Mr Tappertit waved his grizzly truncheon as an admonition to him 

not to interrupt, and ordered three black crosses to the name of 

Curzon.



'Which means,' he said in gracious explanation, 'vengeance, 

complete and terrible.  'Prentice, do you love the Constitution?'



To which the novice (being to that end instructed by his attendant 

sponsors) replied 'I do!'



'The Church, the State, and everything established--but the 

masters?' quoth the captain.



Again the novice said 'I do.'



Having said it, he listened meekly to the captain, who in an 

address prepared for such occasions, told him how that under that 

same Constitution (which was kept in a strong box somewhere, but 

where exactly he could not find out, or he would have endeavoured 

to procure a copy of it), the 'prentices had, in times gone by, 

had frequent holidays of right, broken people's heads by scores, 

defied their masters, nay, even achieved some glorious murders in 

the streets, which privileges had gradually been wrested from them, 

and in all which noble aspirations they were now restrained; how 

the degrading checks imposed upon them were unquestionably 

attributable to the innovating spirit of the times, and how they 

united therefore to resist all change, except such change as would 

restore those good old English customs, by which they would stand 

or fall.  After illustrating the wisdom of going backward, by 

reference to that sagacious fish, the crab, and the not unfrequent 

practice of the mule and donkey, he described their general 

objects; which were briefly vengeance on their Tyrant Masters (of 

whose grievous and insupportable oppression no 'prentice could 

entertain a moment's doubt) and the restoration, as aforesaid, of 

their ancient rights and holidays; for neither of which objects 

were they now quite ripe, being barely twenty strong, but which 

they pledged themselves to pursue with fire and sword when needful.  

Then he described the oath which every member of that small remnant 

of a noble body took, and which was of a dreadful and impressive 

kind; binding him, at the bidding of his chief, to resist and 

obstruct the Lord Mayor, sword-bearer, and chaplain; to despise the 

authority of the sheriffs; and to hold the court of aldermen as 

nought; but not on any account, in case the fulness of time should 

bring a general rising of 'prentices, to damage or in any way 

disfigure Temple Bar, which was strictly constitutional and always 

to be approached with reverence.  Having gone over these several 

heads with great eloquence and force, and having further informed 

the novice that this society had its origin in his own teeming 

brain, stimulated by a swelling sense of wrong and outrage, Mr 

Tappertit demanded whether he had strength of heart to take the 

mighty pledge required, or whether he would withdraw while retreat 

was yet in his power.



To this the novice made rejoinder, that he would take the vow, 

though it should choke him; and it was accordingly administered 

with many impressive circumstances, among which the lighting up of 

the two skulls with a candle-end inside of each, and a great many 

flourishes with the bone, were chiefly conspicuous; not to mention 

a variety of grave exercises with the blunderbuss and sabre, and 

some dismal groaning by unseen 'prentices without.  All these dark 

and direful ceremonies being at length completed, the table was put 

aside, the chair of state removed, the sceptre locked up in its 

usual cupboard, the doors of communication between the three 

cellars thrown freely open, and the 'Prentice Knights resigned 

themselves to merriment.



But Mr Tappertit, who had a soul above the vulgar herd, and who, on 

account of his greatness, could only afford to be merry now and 

then, threw himself on a bench with the air of a man who was faint 

with dignity.  He looked with an indifferent eye, alike on 

skittles, cards, and dice, thinking only of the locksmith's 

daughter, and the base degenerate days on which he had fallen.



'My noble captain neither games, nor sings, nor dances,' said his 

host, taking a seat beside him.  'Drink, gallant general!'



Mr Tappertit drained the proffered goblet to the dregs; then thrust 

his hands into his pockets, and with a lowering visage walked among 

the skittles, while his followers (such is the influence of 

superior genius) restrained the ardent ball, and held his little 

shins in dumb respect.



'If I had been born a corsair or a pirate, a brigand, genteel 

highwayman or patriot--and they're the same thing,' thought Mr 

Tappertit, musing among the nine-pins, 'I should have been all 

right.  But to drag out a ignoble existence unbeknown to mankind in 

general--patience!  I will be famous yet.  A voice within me keeps 

on whispering Greatness.  I shall burst out one of these days, and 

when I do, what power can keep me down?  I feel my soul getting 

into my head at the idea.  More drink there!'



'The novice,' pursued Mr Tappertit, not exactly in a voice of 

thunder, for his tones, to say the truth were rather cracked and 

shrill--but very impressively, notwithstanding--'where is he?'



'Here, noble captain!' cried Stagg.  'One stands beside me who I 

feel is a stranger.'



'Have you,' said Mr Tappertit, letting his gaze fall on the party 

indicated, who was indeed the new knight, by this time restored to 

his own apparel; 'Have you the impression of your street-door key 

in wax?'



The long comrade anticipated the reply, by producing it from the 

shelf on which it had been deposited.



'Good,' said Mr Tappertit, scrutinising it attentively, while a 

breathless silence reigned around; for he had constructed secret 

door-keys for the whole society, and perhaps owed something of his 

influence to that mean and trivial circumstance--on such slight 

accidents do even men of mind depend!--'This is easily made.  Come 

hither, friend.'



With that, he beckoned the new knight apart, and putting the 

pattern in his pocket, motioned to him to walk by his side.



'And so,' he said, when they had taken a few turns up and down, 

you--you love your master's daughter?'



'I do,' said the 'prentice.  'Honour bright.  No chaff, you know.'



'Have you,' rejoined Mr Tappertit, catching him by the wrist, and 

giving him a look which would have been expressive of the most 

deadly malevolence, but for an accidental hiccup that rather 

interfered with it; 'have you a--a rival?'



'Not as I know on,' replied the 'prentice.



'If you had now--' said Mr Tappertit--'what would you--eh?--'



The 'prentice looked fierce and clenched his fists.



'It is enough,' cried Mr Tappertit hastily, 'we understand each 

other.  We are observed.  I thank you.'



So saying, he cast him off again; and calling the long comrade 

aside after taking a few hasty turns by himself, bade him 

immediately write and post against the wall, a notice, proscribing 

one Joseph Willet (commonly known as Joe) of Chigwell; forbidding 

all 'Prentice Knights to succour, comfort, or hold communion with 

him; and requiring them, on pain of excommunication, to molest, 

hurt, wrong, annoy, and pick quarrels with the said Joseph, 

whensoever and wheresoever they, or any of them, should happen to 

encounter him.



Having relieved his mind by this energetic proceeding, he 

condescended to approach the festive board, and warming by degrees, 

at length deigned to preside, and even to enchant the company with 

a song.  After this, he rose to such a pitch as to consent to 

regale the society with a hornpipe, which be actually performed to 

the music of a fiddle (played by an ingenious member) with such 

surpassing agility and brilliancy of execution, that the spectators 

could not be sufficiently enthusiastic in their admiration; and 

their host protested, with tears in his eyes, that he had never 

truly felt his blindness until that moment.



But the host withdrawing--probably to weep in secret--soon returned 

with the information that it wanted little more than an hour of 

day, and that all the cocks in Barbican had already begun to crow, 

as if their lives depended on it.  At this intelligence, the 

'Prentice Knights arose in haste, and marshalling into a line, 

filed off one by one and dispersed with all speed to their several 

homes, leaving their leader to pass the grating last.



'Good night, noble captain,' whispered the blind man as he held it 

open for his passage out; 'Farewell, brave general.  Bye, bye, 

illustrious commander.  Good luck go with you for a--conceited, 

bragging, empty-headed, duck-legged idiot.'



With which parting words, coolly added as he listened to his 

receding footsteps and locked the grate upon himself, he descended 

the steps, and lighting the fire below the little copper, 

prepared, without any assistance, for his daily occupation; which 

was to retail at the area-head above pennyworths of broth and soup, 

and savoury puddings, compounded of such scraps as were to be 

bought in the heap for the least money at Fleet Market in the 

evening time; and for the sale of which he had need to have 

depended chiefly on his private connection, for the court had no 

thoroughfare, and was not that kind of place in which many people 

were likely to take the air, or to frequent as an agreeable 

promenade.
