On this same day, and about this very hour, Mr Willet the elder sat 

smoking his pipe in a chamber at the Black Lion.  Although it was 

hot summer weather, Mr Willet sat close to the fire.  He was in a 

state of profound cogitation, with his own thoughts, and it was his 

custom at such times to stew himself slowly, under the impression 

that that process of cookery was favourable to the melting out of 

his ideas, which, when he began to simmer, sometimes oozed forth so 

copiously as to astonish even himself.



Mr Willet had been several thousand times comforted by his friends 

and acquaintance, with the assurance that for the loss he had 

sustained in the damage done to the Maypole, he could 'come upon 

the county.'  But as this phrase happened to bear an unfortunate 

resemblance to the popular expression of 'coming on the parish,' it 

suggested to Mr Willet's mind no more consolatory visions than 

pauperism on an extensive scale, and ruin in a capacious aspect.  

Consequently, he had never failed to receive the intelligence with 

a rueful shake of the head, or a dreary stare, and had been always 

observed to appear much more melancholy after a visit of condolence 

than at any other time in the whole four-and-twenty hours.



It chanced, however, that sitting over the fire on this particular 

occasion--perhaps because he was, as it were, done to a turn; 

perhaps because he was in an unusually bright state of mind; 

perhaps because he had considered the subject so long; perhaps 

because of all these favouring circumstances, taken together--it 

chanced that, sitting over the fire on this particular occasion, Mr 

Willet did, afar off and in the remotest depths of his intellect, 

perceive a kind of lurking hint or faint suggestion, that out of 

the public purse there might issue funds for the restoration of the 

Maypole to its former high place among the taverns of the earth.  

And this dim ray of light did so diffuse itself within him, and did 

so kindle up and shine, that at last he had it as plainly and 

visibly before him as the blaze by which he sat; and, fully 

persuaded that he was the first to make the discovery, and that he 

had started, hunted down, fallen upon, and knocked on the head, a 

perfectly original idea which had never presented itself to any 

other man, alive or dead, he laid down his pipe, rubbed his hands, 

and chuckled audibly.



'Why, father!' cried Joe, entering at the moment, 'you're in 

spirits to-day!'



'It's nothing partickler,' said Mr Willet, chuckling again.  'It's 

nothing at all partickler, Joseph.  Tell me something about the 

Salwanners.'  Having preferred this request, Mr Willet chuckled a 

third time, and after these unusual demonstrations of levity, he 

put his pipe in his mouth again.



'What shall I tell you, father?' asked Joe, laying his hand upon 

his sire's shoulder, and looking down into his face.  'That I have 

come back, poorer than a church mouse?  You know that.  That I have 

come back, maimed and crippled?  You know that.'



'It was took off,' muttered Mr Willet,with his eyes upon the fire, 

'at the defence of the Salwanners, in America, where the war is.'



'Quite right,' returned Joe, smiling, and leaning with his 

remaining elbow on the back of his father's chair; 'the very 

subject I came to speak to you about.  A man with one arm, father, 

is not of much use in the busy world.'



This was one of those vast propositions which Mr Willet had never 

considered for an instant, and required time to 'tackle.'  

Wherefore he made no answer.



'At all events,' said Joe, 'he can't pick and choose his means of 

earning a livelihood, as another man may.  He can't say "I will 

turn my hand to this," or "I won't turn my hand to that," but must 

take what he can do, and be thankful it's no worse.--What did you 

say?'



Mr Willet had been softly repeating to himself, in a musing tone, 

the words 'defence of the Salwanners:' but he seemed embarrassed at 

having been overheard, and answered 'Nothing.'



'Now look here, father.--Mr Edward has come to England from the 

West Indies.  When he was lost sight of (I ran away on the same 

day, father), he made a voyage to one of the islands, where a 

school-friend of his had settled; and, finding him, wasn't too 

proud to be employed on his estate, and--and in short, got on well, 

and is prospering, and has come over here on business of his own, 

and is going back again speedily.  Our returning nearly at the 

same time, and meeting in the course of the late troubles, has been 

a good thing every way; for it has not only enabled us to do old 

friends some service, but has opened a path in life for me which I 

may tread without being a burden upon you.  To be plain, father, he 

can employ me; I have satisfied myself that I can be of real use to 

him; and I am going to carry my one arm away with him, and to make 

the most of it.



In the mind's eye of Mr Willet, the West Indies, and indeed all 

foreign countries, were inhabited by savage nations, who were 

perpetually burying pipes of peace, flourishing tomahawks, and 

puncturing strange patterns in their bodies.  He no sooner heard 

this announcement, therefore, than he leaned back in his chair, 

took his pipe from his lips, and stared at his son with as much 

dismay as if he already beheld him tied to a stake, and tortured 

for the entertainment of a lively population.  In what form of 

expression his feelings would have found a vent, it is impossible 

to say.  Nor is it necessary: for, before a syllable occurred to 

him, Dolly Varden came running into the room, in tears, threw 

herself on Joe's breast without a word of explanation, and clasped 

her white arms round his neck.



'Dolly!' cried Joe.  'Dolly!'



'Ay, call me that; call me that always,' exclaimed the locksmith's 

little daughter; 'never speak coldly to me, never be distant, never 

again reprove me for the follies I have long repented, or I shall 

die, Joe.'



'I reprove you!' said Joe.



'Yes--for every kind and honest word you uttered, went to my heart.  

For you, who have borne so much from me--for you, who owe your 

sufferings and pain to my caprice--for you to be so kind--so noble 

to me, Joe--'



He could say nothing to her.  Not a syllable.  There was an odd 

sort of eloquence in his one arm, which had crept round her waist: 

but his lips were mute.



'If you had reminded me by a word--only by one short word,' sobbed 

Dolly, clinging yet closer to him, 'how little I deserved that you 

should treat me with so much forbearance; if you had exulted only 

for one moment in your triumph, I could have borne it better.'



'Triumph!' repeated Joe, with a smile which seemed to say, 'I am a 

pretty figure for that.'



'Yes, triumph,' she cried, with her whole heart and soul in her 

earnest voice, and gushing tears; 'for it is one.  I am glad to 

think and know it is.  I wouldn't be less humbled, dear--I wouldn't 

be without the recollection of that last time we spoke together in 

this place--no, not if I could recall the past, and make our 

parting, yesterday.'



Did ever lover look as Joe looked now!



'Dear Joe,' said Dolly, 'I always loved you--in my own heart I 

always did, although I was so vain and giddy.  I hoped you would 

come back that night.  I made quite sure you would.  I prayed for 

it on my knees.  Through all these long, long years, I have never 

once forgotten you, or left off hoping that this happy time might 

come.'



The eloquence of Joe's arm surpassed the most impassioned language; 

and so did that of his lips--yet he said nothing, either.



'And now, at last,' cried Dolly, trembling with the fervour of her 

speech, 'if you were sick, and shattered in your every limb; if you 

were ailing, weak, and sorrowful; if, instead of being what you 

are, you were in everybody's eyes but mine the wreck and ruin of a 

man; I would be your wife, dear love, with greater pride and joy, 

than if you were the stateliest lord in England!'



'What have I done,' cried Joe, 'what have I done to meet with this 

reward?'



'You have taught me,' said Dolly, raising her pretty face to his, 

'to know myself, and your worth; to be something better than I 

was; to be more deserving of your true and manly nature.  In years 

to come, dear Joe, you shall find that you have done so; for I will 

be, not only now, when we are young and full of hope, but when we 

have grown old and weary, your patient, gentle, never-tiring 

wife.  I will never know a wish or care beyond our home and you, 

and I will always study how to please you with my best affection 

and my most devoted love.  I will: indeed I will!'



Joe could only repeat his former eloquence--but it was very much to 

the purpose.



'They know of this, at home,' said Dolly.  'For your sake, I would 

leave even them; but they know it, and are glad of it, and are as 

proud of you as I am, and as full of gratitude.--You'll not come 

and see me as a poor friend who knew me when I was a girl, will 

you, dear Joe?'



Well, well!  It don't matter what Joe said in answer, but he said a 

great deal; and Dolly said a great deal too: and he folded Dolly in 

his one arm pretty tight, considering that it was but one; and 

Dolly made no resistance: and if ever two people were happy in this 

world--which is not an utterly miserable one, with all its faults--

we may, with some appearance of certainty, conclude that they 

were.



To say that during these proceedings Mr Willet the elder underwent 

the greatest emotions of astonishment of which our common nature is 

susceptible--to say that he was in a perfect paralysis of surprise, 

and that he wandered into the most stupendous and theretofore 

unattainable heights of complicated amazement--would be to shadow 

forth his state of mind in the feeblest and lamest terms.  If a 

roc, an eagle, a griffin, a flying elephant, a winged sea-horse, 

had suddenly appeared, and, taking him on its back, carried him 

bodily into the heart of the 'Salwanners,' it would have been to 

him as an everyday occurrence, in comparison with what he now 

beheld.  To be sitting quietly by, seeing and hearing these things; 

to be completely overlooked, unnoticed, and disregarded, while his 

son and a young lady were talking to each other in the most 

impassioned manner, kissing each other, and making themselves in 

all respects perfectly at home; was a position so tremendous, so 

inexplicable, so utterly beyond the widest range of his capacity of 

comprehension, that he fell into a lethargy of wonder, and could no 

more rouse himself than an enchanted sleeper in the first year of 

his fairy lease, a century long.



'Father,' said Joe, presenting Dolly.  'You know who this is?'



Mr Willet looked first at her, then at his son, then back again at 

Dolly, and then made an ineffectual effort to extract a whiff from 

his pipe, which had gone out long ago.



'Say a word, father, if it's only "how d'ye do,"' urged Joe.



'Certainly, Joseph,' answered Mr Willet.  'Oh yes!  Why not?'



'To be sure,' said Joe.  'Why not?'



'Ah!' replied his father.  'Why not?' and with this remark, which 

he uttered in a low voice as though he were discussing some grave 

question with himself, he used the little finger--if any of his 

fingers can be said to have come under that denomination--of his 

right hand as a tobacco-stopper, and was silent again.



And so he sat for half an hour at least, although Dolly, in the 

most endearing of manners, hoped, a dozen times, that he was not 

angry with her.  So he sat for half an hour, quite motionless, and 

looking all the while like nothing so much as a great Dutch Pin or 

Skittle.  At the expiration of that period, he suddenly, and 

without the least notice, burst (to the great consternation of the 

young people) into a very loud and very short laugh; and 

repeating, 'Certainly, Joseph.  Oh yes!  Why not?' went out for a 

walk.
