Twilight had given place to night some hours, and it was high noon 

in those quarters of the town in which 'the world' condescended to 

dwell--the world being then, as now, of very limited dimensions and 

easily lodged--when Mr Chester reclined upon a sofa in his 

dressing-room in the Temple, entertaining himself with a book.



He was dressing, as it seemed, by easy stages, and having performed 

half the journey was taking a long rest.  Completely attired as to 

his legs and feet in the trimmest fashion of the day, he had yet 

the remainder of his toilet to perform.  The coat was stretched, 

like a refined scarecrow, on its separate horse; the waistcoat was 

displayed to the best advantage; the various ornamental articles of 

dress were severally set out in most alluring order; and yet he lay 

dangling his legs between the sofa and the ground, as intent upon 

his book as if there were nothing but bed before him.



'Upon my honour,' he said, at length raising his eyes to the 

ceiling with the air of a man who was reflecting seriously on what 

he had read; 'upon my honour, the most masterly composition, the 

most delicate thoughts, the finest code of morality, and the most 

gentlemanly sentiments in the universe!  Ah Ned, Ned, if you would 

but form your mind by such precepts, we should have but one common 

feeling on every subject that could possibly arise between us!'



This apostrophe was addressed, like the rest of his remarks, to 

empty air: for Edward was not present, and the father was quite 

alone.



'My Lord Chesterfield,' he said, pressing his hand tenderly upon 

the book as he laid it down, 'if I could but have profited by your 

genius soon enough to have formed my son on the model you have left 

to all wise fathers, both he and I would have been rich men.  

Shakespeare was undoubtedly very fine in his way; Milton good, 

though prosy; Lord Bacon deep, and decidedly knowing; but the 

writer who should be his country's pride, is my Lord Chesterfield.'



He became thoughtful again, and the toothpick was in requisition.



'I thought I was tolerably accomplished as a man of the world,' he 

continued, 'I flattered myself that I was pretty well versed in all 

those little arts and graces which distinguish men of the world 

from boors and peasants, and separate their character from those 

intensely vulgar sentiments which are called the national 

character.  Apart from any natural prepossession in my own favour, 

I believed I was.  Still, in every page of this enlightened writer, 

I find some captivating hypocrisy which has never occurred to me 

before, or some superlative piece of selfishness to which I was 

utterly a stranger.  I should quite blush for myself before this 

stupendous creature, if remembering his precepts, one might blush 

at anything.  An amazing man! a nobleman indeed! any King or Queen 

may make a Lord, but only the Devil himself--and the Graces--can 

make a Chesterfield.'



Men who are thoroughly false and hollow, seldom try to hide those 

vices from themselves; and yet in the very act of avowing them, 

they lay claim to the virtues they feign most to despise.  'For,' 

say they, 'this is honesty, this is truth.  All mankind are like 

us, but they have not the candour to avow it.'  The more they 

affect to deny the existence of any sincerity in the world, the 

more they would be thought to possess it in its boldest shape; and 

this is an unconscious compliment to Truth on the part of these 

philosophers, which will turn the laugh against them to the Day of 

Judgment.



Mr Chester, having extolled his favourite author, as above recited, 

took up the book again in the excess of his admiration and was 

composing himself for a further perusal of its sublime morality, 

when he was disturbed by a noise at the outer door; occasioned as 

it seemed by the endeavours of his servant to obstruct the entrance 

of some unwelcome visitor.



'A late hour for an importunate creditor,' he said, raising his 

eyebrows with as indolent an expression of wonder as if the noise 

were in the street, and one with which he had not the smallest 

possible concern.  'Much after their accustomed time.  The usual 

pretence I suppose.  No doubt a heavy payment to make up tomorrow.  

Poor fellow, he loses time, and time is money as the good proverb 

says--I never found it out though.  Well.  What now?  You know I am 

not at home.'



'A man, sir,' replied the servant, who was to the full as cool and 

negligent in his way as his master, 'has brought home the riding-

whip you lost the other day.  I told him you were out, but he said 

he was to wait while I brought it in, and wouldn't go till I did.'



'He was quite right,' returned his master, 'and you're a blockhead, 

possessing no judgment or discretion whatever.  Tell him to come 

in, and see that he rubs his shoes for exactly five minutes first.'



The man laid the whip on a chair, and withdrew.  The master, who 

had only heard his foot upon the ground and had not taken the 

trouble to turn round and look at him, shut his book, and pursued 

the train of ideas his entrance had disturbed.



'If time were money,' he said, handling his snuff-box, 'I would 

compound with my creditors, and give them--let me see--how much a 

day?  There's my nap after dinner--an hour--they're extremely 

welcome to that, and to make the most of it.  In the morning, 

between my breakfast and the paper, I could spare them another 

hour; in the evening before dinner say another.  Three hours a day.  

They might pay themselves in calls, with interest, in twelve 

months.  I think I shall propose it to them.  Ah, my centaur, are 

you there?'



'Here I am,' replied Hugh, striding in, followed by a dog, as rough 

and sullen as himself; 'and trouble enough I've had to get here.  

What do you ask me to come for, and keep me out when I DO come?'



'My good fellow,' returned the other, raising his head a little 

from the cushion and carelessly surveying him from top to toe, 'I 

am delighted to see you, and to have, in your being here, the very 

best proof that you are not kept out.  How are you?'



'I'm well enough,' said Hugh impatiently.



'You look a perfect marvel of health.  Sit down.'



'I'd rather stand,' said Hugh.



'Please yourself my good fellow,' returned Mr Chester rising, 

slowly pulling off the loose robe he wore, and sitting down before 

the dressing-glass.  'Please yourself by all means.'



Having said this in the politest and blandest tone possible, he 

went on dressing, and took no further notice of his guest, who 

stood in the same spot as uncertain what to do next, eyeing him 

sulkily from time to time.



'Are you going to speak to me, master?' he said, after a long 

silence.



'My worthy creature,' returned Mr Chester, 'you are a little 

ruffled and out of humour.  I'll wait till you're quite yourself 

again.  I am in no hurry.'



This behaviour had its intended effect.  It humbled and abashed the 

man, and made him still more irresolute and uncertain.  Hard words 

he could have returned, violence he would have repaid with 

interest; but this cool, complacent, contemptuous, self-possessed 

reception, caused him to feel his inferiority more completely than 

the most elaborate arguments.  Everything contributed to this 

effect.  His own rough speech, contrasted with the soft persuasive 

accents of the other; his rude bearing, and Mr Chester's polished 

manner; the disorder and negligence of his ragged dress, and the 

elegant attire he saw before him; with all the unaccustomed 

luxuries and comforts of the room, and the silence that gave him 

leisure to observe these things, and feel how ill at ease they made 

him; all these influences, which have too often some effect on 

tutored minds and become of almost resistless power when brought to 

bear on such a mind as his, quelled Hugh completely.  He moved by 

little and little nearer to Mr Chester's chair, and glancing over 

his shoulder at the reflection of his face in the glass, as if 

seeking for some encouragement in its expression, said at length, 

with a rough attempt at conciliation,



'ARE you going to speak to me, master, or am I to go away?'



'Speak you,' said Mr Chester, 'speak you, good fellow.  I have 

spoken, have I not?  I am waiting for you.'



'Why, look'ee, sir,' returned Hugh with increased embarrassment, 

'am I the man that you privately left your whip with before you 

rode away from the Maypole, and told to bring it back whenever he 

might want to see you on a certain subject?'



'No doubt the same, or you have a twin brother,' said Mr Chester, 

glancing at the reflection of his anxious face; 'which is not 

probable, I should say.'



'Then I have come, sir,' said Hugh, 'and I have brought it back, 

and something else along with it.  A letter, sir, it is, that I 

took from the person who had charge of it.'  As he spoke, he laid 

upon the dressing-table, Dolly's lost epistle.  The very letter 

that had cost her so much trouble.



'Did you obtain this by force, my good fellow?' said Mr Chester, 

casting his eye upon it without the least perceptible surprise or 

pleasure.



'Not quite,' said Hugh.  'Partly.'



'Who was the messenger from whom you took it?'



'A woman.  One Varden's daughter.'



'Oh indeed!' said Mr Chester gaily.  'What else did you take from 

her?'



'What else?'



'Yes,' said the other, in a drawling manner, for he was fixing a 

very small patch of sticking plaster on a very small pimple near 

the corner of his mouth.  'What else?'



'Well a kiss,' replied Hugh, after some hesitation.



'And what else?'



'Nothing.'



'I think,' said Mr Chester, in the same easy tone, and smiling 

twice or thrice to try if the patch adhered--'I think there was 

something else.  I have heard a trifle of jewellery spoken of--a 

mere trifle--a thing of such little value, indeed, that you may 

have forgotten it.  Do you remember anything of the kind--such as a 

bracelet now, for instance?'



Hugh with a muttered oath thrust his hand into his breast, and 

drawing the bracelet forth, wrapped in a scrap of hay, was about to 

lay it on the table likewise, when his patron stopped his hand and 

bade him put it up again.



'You took that for yourself my excellent friend,' he said, 'and may 

keep it.  I am neither a thief nor a receiver.  Don't show it to 

me.  You had better hide it again, and lose no time.  Don't let me 

see where you put it either,' he added, turning away his head.



'You're not a receiver!' said Hugh bluntly, despite the increasing 

awe in which he held him.  'What do you call THAT, master?' 

striking the letter with his heavy hand.



'I call that quite another thing,' said Mr Chester coolly.  'I 

shall prove it presently, as you will see.  You are thirsty, I 

suppose?'



Hugh drew his sleeve across his lips, and gruffly answered yes.



'Step to that closet and bring me a bottle you will see there, and 

a glass.'



He obeyed.  His patron followed him with his eyes, and when his 

back was turned, smiled as he had never done when he stood beside 

the mirror.  On his return he filled the glass, and bade him drink.  

That dram despatched, he poured him out another, and another.



'How many can you bear?' he said, filling the glass again.



'As many as you like to give me.  Pour on.  Fill high.  A bumper 

with a bead in the middle!  Give me enough of this,' he added, as 

he tossed it down his hairy throat, 'and I'll do murder if you ask 

me!'



'As I don't mean to ask you, and you might possibly do it without 

being invited if you went on much further,' said Mr Chester with 

great composure, we will stop, if agreeable to you, my good friend, 

at the next glass.  You were drinking before you came here.'



'I always am when I can get it,' cried Hugh boisterously, waving 

the empty glass above his head, and throwing himself into a rude 

dancing attitude.  'I always am.  Why not?  Ha ha ha!  What's so 

good to me as this?  What ever has been?  What else has kept away 

the cold on bitter nights, and driven hunger off in starving times?  

What else has given me the strength and courage of a man, when men 

would have left me to die, a puny child?  I should never have had a 

man's heart but for this.  I should have died in a ditch.  Where's 

he who when I was a weak and sickly wretch, with trembling legs and 

fading sight, bade me cheer up, as this did?  I never knew him; not 

I.  I drink to the drink, master.  Ha ha ha!'



'You are an exceedingly cheerful young man,' said Mr Chester, 

putting on his cravat with great deliberation, and slightly moving 

his head from side to side to settle his chin in its proper place.  

'Quite a boon companion.'



'Do you see this hand, master,' said Hugh, 'and this arm?' baring 

the brawny limb to the elbow.  'It was once mere skin and bone, and 

would have been dust in some poor churchyard by this time, but for 

the drink.'



'You may cover it,' said Mr Chester, 'it's sufficiently real in 

your sleeve.'



'I should never have been spirited up to take a kiss from the proud 

little beauty, master, but for the drink,' cried Hugh.  'Ha ha ha!  

It was a good one.  As sweet as honeysuckle, I warrant you.  I 

thank the drink for it.  I'll drink to the drink again, master.  

Fill me one more.  Come.  One more!'



'You are such a promising fellow,' said his patron, putting on his 

waistcoat with great nicety, and taking no heed of this request, 

'that I must caution you against having too many impulses from the 

drink, and getting hung before your time.  What's your age?'



'I don't know.'



'At any rate,' said Mr Chester, 'you are young enough to escape 

what I may call a natural death for some years to come.  How can 

you trust yourself in my hands on so short an acquaintance, with a 

halter round your neck?  What a confiding nature yours must be!'



Hugh fell back a pace or two and surveyed him with a look of 

mingled terror, indignation, and surprise.  Regarding himself in 

the glass with the same complacency as before, and speaking as 

smoothly as if he were discussing some pleasant chit-chat of the 

town, his patron went on:



'Robbery on the king's highway, my young friend, is a very 

dangerous and ticklish occupation.  It is pleasant, I have no 

doubt, while it lasts; but like many other pleasures in this 

transitory world, it seldom lasts long.  And really if in the 

ingenuousness of youth, you open your heart so readily on the 

subject, I am afraid your career will be an extremely short one.'



'How's this?' said Hugh.  'What do you talk of master?  Who was it 

set me on?'



'Who?' said Mr Chester, wheeling sharply round, and looking full 

at him for the first time.  'I didn't hear you.  Who was it?'



Hugh faltered, and muttered something which was not audible.



'Who was it?  I am curious to know,' said Mr Chester, with 

surpassing affability.  'Some rustic beauty perhaps?  But be 

cautious, my good friend.  They are not always to be trusted.  Do 

take my advice now, and be careful of yourself.'  With these words 

he turned to the glass again, and went on with his toilet.



Hugh would have answered him that he, the questioner himself had 

set him on, but the words stuck in his throat.  The consummate art 

with which his patron had led him to this point, and managed the 

whole conversation, perfectly baffled him.  He did not doubt that 

if he had made the retort which was on his lips when Mr Chester 

turned round and questioned him so keenly, he would straightway 

have given him into custody and had him dragged before a justice 

with the stolen property upon him; in which case it was as certain 

he would have been hung as it was that he had been born.  The 

ascendency which it was the purpose of the man of the world to 

establish over this savage instrument, was gained from that time.  

Hugh's submission was complete.  He dreaded him beyond description; 

and felt that accident and artifice had spun a web about him, which 

at a touch from such a master-hand as his, would bind him to the 

gallows.



With these thoughts passing through his mind, and yet wondering at 

the very same time how he who came there rioting in the confidence 

of this man (as he thought), should be so soon and so thoroughly 

subdued, Hugh stood cowering before him, regarding him uneasily 

from time to time, while he finished dressing.  When he had done 

so, he took up the letter, broke the seal, and throwing himself 

back in his chair, read it leisurely through.



'Very neatly worded upon my life!  Quite a woman's letter, full of 

what people call tenderness, and disinterestedness, and heart, and 

all that sort of thing!'



As he spoke, he twisted it up, and glancing lazily round at Hugh as 

though he would say 'You see this?' held it in the flame of the 

candle.  When it was in a full blaze, he tossed it into the grate, 

and there it smouldered away.



'It was directed to my son,' he said, turning to Hugh, 'and you did 

quite right to bring it here.  I opened it on my own 

responsibility, and you see what I have done with it.  Take this, 

for your trouble.'



Hugh stepped forward to receive the piece of money he held out to 

him.  As he put it in his hand, he added:



'If you should happen to find anything else of this sort, or to 

pick up any kind of information you may think I would like to have, 

bring it here, will you, my good fellow?'



This was said with a smile which implied--or Hugh thought it did--

'fail to do so at your peril!'  He answered that he would.



'And don't,' said his patron, with an air of the very kindest 

patronage, 'don't be at all downcast or uneasy respecting that 

little rashness we have been speaking of.  Your neck is as safe in 

my hands, my good fellow, as though a baby's fingers clasped it, I 

assure you.--Take another glass.  You are quieter now.'



Hugh accepted it from his hand, and looking stealthily at his 

smiling face, drank the contents in silence.



'Don't you--ha, ha!--don't you drink to the drink any more?' said 

Mr Chester, in his most winning manner.



'To you, sir,' was the sullen answer, with something approaching to 

a bow.  'I drink to you.'



'Thank you.  God bless you.  By the bye, what is your name, my good 

soul?  You are called Hugh, I know, of course--your other name?'



'I have no other name.'



'A very strange fellow!  Do you mean that you never knew one, or 

that you don't choose to tell it?  Which?'



'I'd tell it if I could,' said Hugh, quickly.  'I can't.  I have 

been always called Hugh; nothing more.  I never knew, nor saw, nor 

thought about a father; and I was a boy of six--that's not very 

old--when they hung my mother up at Tyburn for a couple of thousand 

men to stare at.  They might have let her live.  She was poor 

enough.'



'How very sad!' exclaimed his patron, with a condescending smile.  

'I have no doubt she was an exceedingly fine woman.'



'You see that dog of mine?' said Hugh, abruptly.



'Faithful, I dare say?' rejoined his patron, looking at him through 

his glass; 'and immensely clever?  Virtuous and gifted animals, 

whether man or beast, always are so very hideous.'



'Such a dog as that, and one of the same breed, was the only living 

thing except me that howled that day,' said Hugh.  'Out of the two 

thousand odd--there was a larger crowd for its being a woman--the 

dog and I alone had any pity.  If he'd have been a man, he'd have 

been glad to be quit of her, for she had been forced to keep him 

lean and half-starved; but being a dog, and not having a man's 

sense, he was sorry.'



'It was dull of the brute, certainly,' said Mr Chester, 'and very 

like a brute.'



Hugh made no rejoinder, but whistling to his dog, who sprung up at 

the sound and came jumping and sporting about him, bade his 

sympathising friend good night.



'Good night; he returned.  'Remember; you're safe with me--quite 

safe.  So long as you deserve it, my good fellow, as I hope you 

always will, you have a friend in me, on whose silence you may 

rely.  Now do be careful of yourself, pray do, and consider what 

jeopardy you might have stood in.  Good night! bless you!'



Hugh truckled before the hidden meaning of these words as much as 

such a being could, and crept out of the door so submissively and 

subserviently--with an air, in short, so different from that with 

which he had entered--that his patron on being left alone, smiled 

more than ever.



'And yet,' he said, as he took a pinch of snuff, 'I do not like 

their having hanged his mother.  The fellow has a fine eye, and I 

am sure she was handsome.  But very probably she was coarse--red-

nosed perhaps, and had clumsy feet.  Aye, it was all for the best, 

no doubt.'



With this comforting reflection, he put on his coat, took a 

farewell glance at the glass, and summoned his man, who promptly 

attended, followed by a chair and its two bearers.



'Foh!' said Mr Chester.  'The very atmosphere that centaur has 

breathed, seems tainted with the cart and ladder.  Here, Peak.  

Bring some scent and sprinkle the floor; and take away the chair he 

sat upon, and air it; and dash a little of that mixture upon me.  I 

am stifled!'



The man obeyed; and the room and its master being both purified, 

nothing remained for Mr Chester but to demand his hat, to fold it 

jauntily under his arm, to take his seat in the chair and be 

carried off; humming a fashionable tune.
