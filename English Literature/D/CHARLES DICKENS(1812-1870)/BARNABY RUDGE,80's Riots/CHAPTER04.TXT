In the venerable suburb--it was a suburb once--of Clerkenwell, 

towards that part of its confines which is nearest to the Charter 

House, and in one of those cool, shady Streets, of which a few, 

widely scattered and dispersed, yet remain in such old parts of the 

metropolis,--each tenement quietly vegetating like an ancient 

citizen who long ago retired from business, and dozing on in its 

infirmity until in course of time it tumbles down, and is replaced 

by some extravagant young heir, flaunting in stucco and ornamental 

work, and all the vanities of modern days,--in this quarter, and in 

a street of this description, the business of the present chapter 

lies.



At the time of which it treats, though only six-and-sixty years 

ago, a very large part of what is London now had no existence.  

Even in the brains of the wildest speculators, there had sprung up 

no long rows of streets connecting Highgate with Whitechapel, no 

assemblages of palaces in the swampy levels, nor little cities in 

the open fields.  Although this part of town was then, as now, 

parcelled out in streets, and plentifully peopled, it wore a 

different aspect.  There were gardens to many of the houses, and 

trees by the pavement side; with an air of freshness breathing up 

and down, which in these days would be sought in vain.  Fields were 

nigh at hand, through which the New River took its winding course, 

and where there was merry haymaking in the summer time.  Nature was 

not so far removed, or hard to get at, as in these days; and 

although there were busy trades in Clerkenwell, and working 

jewellers by scores, it was a purer place, with farm-houses nearer 

to it than many modern Londoners would readily believe, and lovers' 

walks at no great distance, which turned into squalid courts, long 

before the lovers of this age were born, or, as the phrase goes, 

thought of.



In one of these streets, the cleanest of them all, and on the shady 

side of the way--for good housewives know that sunlight damages 

their cherished furniture, and so choose the shade rather than its 

intrusive glare--there stood the house with which we have to deal.  

It was a modest building, not very straight, not large, not tall; 

not bold-faced, with great staring windows, but a shy, blinking 

house, with a conical roof going up into a peak over its garret 

window of four small panes of glass, like a cocked hat on the head 

of an elderly gentleman with one eye.  It was not built of brick or 

lofty stone, but of wood and plaster; it was not planned with a 

dull and wearisome regard to regularity, for no one window matched 

the other, or seemed to have the slightest reference to anything 

besides itself.



The shop--for it had a shop--was, with reference to the first 

floor, where shops usually are; and there all resemblance between 

it and any other shop stopped short and ceased.  People who went in 

and out didn't go up a flight of steps to it, or walk easily in 

upon a level with the street, but dived down three steep stairs, 

as into a cellar.  Its floor was paved with stone and brick, as 

that of any other cellar might be; and in lieu of window framed and 

glazed it had a great black wooden flap or shutter, nearly breast 

high from the ground, which turned back in the day-time, admitting 

as much cold air as light, and very often more.  Behind this shop 

was a wainscoted parlour, looking first into a paved yard, and 

beyond that again into a little terrace garden, raised some feet 

above it.  Any stranger would have supposed that this wainscoted 

parlour, saving for the door of communication by which he had 

entered, was cut off and detached from all the world; and indeed 

most strangers on their first entrance were observed to grow 

extremely thoughtful, as weighing and pondering in their minds 

whether the upper rooms were only approachable by ladders from 

without; never suspecting that two of the most unassuming and 

unlikely doors in existence, which the most ingenious mechanician 

on earth must of necessity have supposed to be the doors of 

closets, opened out of this room--each without the smallest 

preparation, or so much as a quarter of an inch of passage--upon 

two dark winding flights of stairs, the one upward, the other 

downward, which were the sole means of communication between that 

chamber and the other portions of the house.



With all these oddities, there was not a neater, more scrupulously 

tidy, or more punctiliously ordered house, in Clerkenwell, in 

London, in all England.  There were not cleaner windows, or whiter 

floors, or brighter Stoves, or more highly shining articles of 

furniture in old mahogany; there was not more rubbing, scrubbing, 

burnishing and polishing, in the whole street put together.  Nor 

was this excellence attained without some cost and trouble and 

great expenditure of voice, as the neighbours were frequently 

reminded when the good lady of the house overlooked and assisted in 

its being put to rights on cleaning days--which were usually from 

Monday morning till Saturday night, both days inclusive.



Leaning against the door-post of this, his dwelling, the locksmith 

stood early on the morning after he had met with the wounded man, 

gazing disconsolately at a great wooden emblem of a key, painted in 

vivid yellow to resemble gold, which dangled from the house-front, 

and swung to and fro with a mournful creaking noise, as if 

complaining that it had nothing to unlock.  Sometimes, he looked 

over his shoulder into the shop, which was so dark and dingy with 

numerous tokens of his trade, and so blackened by the smoke of a 

little forge, near which his 'prentice was at work, that it would 

have been difficult for one unused to such espials to have 

distinguished anything but various tools of uncouth make and shape, 

great bunches of rusty keys, fragments of iron, half-finished 

locks, and such like things, which garnished the walls and hung in 

clusters from the ceiling.



After a long and patient contemplation of the golden key, and many 

such backward glances, Gabriel stepped into the road, and stole a 

look at the upper windows.  One of them chanced to be thrown open 

at the moment, and a roguish face met his; a face lighted up by the 

loveliest pair of sparkling eyes that ever locksmith looked upon; 

the face of a pretty, laughing, girl; dimpled and fresh, and 

healthful--the very impersonation of good-humour and blooming 

beauty.



'Hush!' she whispered, bending forward and pointing archly to the 

window underneath.  'Mother is still asleep.'



'Still, my dear,' returned the locksmith in the same tone.  'You 

talk as if she had been asleep all night, instead of little more 

than half an hour.  But I'm very thankful.  Sleep's a blessing--no 

doubt about it.'  The last few words he muttered to himself.



'How cruel of you to keep us up so late this morning, and never 

tell us where you were, or send us word!' said the girl.



'Ah Dolly, Dolly!' returned the locksmith, shaking his head, and 

smiling, 'how cruel of you to run upstairs to bed!  Come down to 

breakfast, madcap, and come down lightly, or you'll wake your 

mother.  She must be tired, I am sure--I am.'



Keeping these latter words to himself, and returning his 

daughter's nod, he was passing into the workshop, with the smile 

she had awakened still beaming on his face, when he just caught 

sight of his 'prentice's brown paper cap ducking down to avoid 

observation, and shrinking from the window back to its former 

place, which the wearer no sooner reached than he began to hammer 

lustily.



'Listening again, Simon!' said Gabriel to himself.  'That's bad.  

What in the name of wonder does he expect the girl to say, that I 

always catch him listening when SHE speaks, and never at any other 

time!  A bad habit, Sim, a sneaking, underhanded way.  Ah! you may 

hammer, but you won't beat that out of me, if you work at it till 

your time's up!'



So saying, and shaking his head gravely, he re-entered the 

workshop, and confronted the subject of these remarks.



'There's enough of that just now,' said the locksmith.  'You 

needn't make any more of that confounded clatter.  Breakfast's 

ready.'



'Sir,' said Sim, looking up with amazing politeness, and a peculiar 

little bow cut short off at the neck, 'I shall attend you 

immediately.'



'I suppose,' muttered Gabriel, 'that's out of the 'Prentice's 

Garland or the 'Prentice's Delight, or the 'Prentice's Warbler, or 

the Prentice's Guide to the Gallows, or some such improving 

textbook.  Now he's going to beautify himself--here's a precious 

locksmith!'



Quite unconscious that his master was looking on from the dark 

corner by the parlour door, Sim threw off the paper cap, sprang 

from his seat, and in two extraordinary steps, something between 

skating and minuet dancing, bounded to a washing place at the other 

end of the shop, and there removed from his face and hands all 

traces of his previous work--practising the same step all the time 

with the utmost gravity.  This done, he drew from some concealed 

place a little scrap of looking-glass, and with its assistance 

arranged his hair, and ascertained the exact state of a little 

carbuncle on his nose.  Having now completed his toilet, he placed 

the fragment of mirror on a low bench, and looked over his shoulder 

at so much of his legs as could be reflected in that small compass, 

with the greatest possible complacency and satisfaction.



Sim, as he was called in the locksmith's family, or Mr Simon 

Tappertit, as he called himself, and required all men to style him 

out of doors, on holidays, and Sundays out,--was an old-fashioned, 

thin-faced, sleek-haired, sharp-nosed, small-eyed little fellow, 

very little more than five feet high, and thoroughly convinced in 

his own mind that he was above the middle size; rather tall, in 

fact, than otherwise.  Of his figure, which was well enough formed, 

though somewhat of the leanest, he entertained the highest 

admiration; and with his legs, which, in knee-breeches, were 

perfect curiosities of littleness, he was enraptured to a degree 

amounting to enthusiasm.  He also had some majestic, shadowy ideas, 

which had never been quite fathomed by his intimate friends, 

concerning the power of his eye.  Indeed he had been known to go so 

far as to boast that he could utterly quell and subdue the 

haughtiest beauty by a simple process, which he termed 'eyeing her 

over;' but it must be added, that neither of this faculty, nor of 

the power he claimed to have, through the same gift, of vanquishing 

and heaving down dumb animals, even in a rabid state, had he ever 

furnished evidence which could be deemed quite satisfactory and 

conclusive.



It may be inferred from these premises, that in the small body of 

Mr Tappertit there was locked up an ambitious and aspiring soul.  

As certain liquors, confined in casks too cramped in their 

dimensions, will ferment, and fret, and chafe in their 

imprisonment, so the spiritual essence or soul of Mr Tappertit 

would sometimes fume within that precious cask, his body, until, 

with great foam and froth and splutter, it would force a vent, and 

carry all before it.  It was his custom to remark, in reference to 

any one of these occasions, that his soul had got into his head; 

and in this novel kind of intoxication many scrapes and mishaps 

befell him, which he had frequently concealed with no small 

difficulty from his worthy master.



Sim Tappertit, among the other fancies upon which his before-

mentioned soul was for ever feasting and regaling itself (and which 

fancies, like the liver of Prometheus, grew as they were fed 

upon), had a mighty notion of his order; and had been heard by the 

servant-maid openly expressing his regret that the 'prentices no 

longer carried clubs wherewith to mace the citizens: that was his 

strong expression.  He was likewise reported to have said that in 

former times a stigma had been cast upon the body by the execution 

of George Barnwell, to which they should not have basely 

submitted, but should have demanded him of the legislature--

temperately at first; then by an appeal to arms, if necessary--to 

be dealt with as they in their wisdom might think fit.  These 

thoughts always led him to consider what a glorious engine the 

'prentices might yet become if they had but a master spirit at 

their head; and then he would darkly, and to the terror of his 

hearers, hint at certain reckless fellows that he knew of, and at a 

certain Lion Heart ready to become their captain, who, once afoot, 

would make the Lord Mayor tremble on his throne.



In respect of dress and personal decoration, Sim Tappertit was no 

less of an adventurous and enterprising character.  He had been 

seen, beyond dispute, to pull off ruffles of the finest quality at 

the corner of the street on Sunday nights, and to put them 

carefully in his pocket before returning home; and it was quite 

notorious that on all great holiday occasions it was his habit to 

exchange his plain steel knee-buckles for a pair of glittering 

paste, under cover of a friendly post, planted most conveniently 

in that same spot.  Add to this that he was in years just twenty, 

in his looks much older, and in conceit at least two hundred; that 

he had no objection to be jested with, touching his admiration of 

his master's daughter; and had even, when called upon at a certain 

obscure tavern to pledge the lady whom he honoured with his love, 

toasted, with many winks and leers, a fair creature whose Christian 

name, he said, began with a D--;--and as much is known of Sim 

Tappertit, who has by this time followed the locksmith in to 

breakfast, as is necessary to be known in making his acquaintance.



It was a substantial meal; for, over and above the ordinary tea 

equipage, the board creaked beneath the weight of a jolly round of 

beef, a ham of the first magnitude, and sundry towers of buttered 

Yorkshire cake, piled slice upon slice in most alluring order.  

There was also a goodly jug of well-browned clay, fashioned into 

the form of an old gentleman, not by any means unlike the 

locksmith, atop of whose bald head was a fine white froth answering 

to his wig, indicative, beyond dispute, of sparkling home-brewed 

ale.  But, better far than fair home-brewed, or Yorkshire cake, or 

ham, or beef, or anything to eat or drink that earth or air or 

water can supply, there sat, presiding over all, the locksmith's 

rosy daughter, before whose dark eyes even beef grew insignificant, 

and malt became as nothing.



Fathers should never kiss their daughters when young men are by.  

It's too much.  There are bounds to human endurance.  So thought 

Sim Tappertit when Gabriel drew those rosy lips to his--those lips 

within Sim's reach from day to day, and yet so far off.  He had a 

respect for his master, but he wished the Yorkshire cake might 

choke him.



'Father,' said the locksmith's daughter, when this salute was over, 

and they took their seats at table, 'what is this I hear about last 

night?'



'All true, my dear; true as the Gospel, Doll.'



'Young Mr Chester robbed, and lying wounded in the road, when you 

came up!'



'Ay--Mr Edward.  And beside him, Barnaby, calling for help with all 

his might.  It was well it happened as it did; for the road's a 

lonely one, the hour was late, and, the night being cold, and poor 

Barnaby even less sensible than usual from surprise and fright, the 

young gentleman might have met his death in a very short time.'



'I dread to think of it!' cried his daughter with a shudder.  'How 

did you know him?'



'Know him!' returned the locksmith.  'I didn't know him--how could 

I?  I had never seen him, often as I had heard and spoken of him.  

I took him to Mrs Rudge's; and she no sooner saw him than the truth 

came out.'



'Miss Emma, father--If this news should reach her, enlarged upon as 

it is sure to be, she will go distracted.'



'Why, lookye there again, how a man suffers for being good-

natured,' said the locksmith.  'Miss Emma was with her uncle at the 

masquerade at Carlisle House, where she had gone, as the people at 

the Warren told me, sorely against her will.  What does your 

blockhead father when he and Mrs Rudge have laid their heads 

together, but goes there when he ought to be abed, makes interest 

with his friend the doorkeeper, slips him on a mask and domino, 

and mixes with the masquers.'



'And like himself to do so!' cried the girl, putting her fair arm 

round his neck, and giving him a most enthusiastic kiss.



'Like himself!' repeated Gabriel, affecting to grumble, but 

evidently delighted with the part he had taken, and with her 

praise.  'Very like himself--so your mother said.  However, he 

mingled with the crowd, and prettily worried and badgered he was, I 

warrant you, with people squeaking, "Don't you know me?" and "I've 

found you out," and all that kind of nonsense in his ears.  He 

might have wandered on till now, but in a little room there was a 

young lady who had taken off her mask, on account of the place 

being very warm, and was sitting there alone.'



'And that was she?' said his daughter hastily.



'And that was she,' replied the locksmith; 'and I no sooner 

whispered to her what the matter was--as softly, Doll, and with 

nearly as much art as you could have used yourself--than she gives 

a kind of scream and faints away.'



'What did you do--what happened next?' asked his daughter.  'Why, 

the masks came flocking round, with a general noise and hubbub, and 

I thought myself in luck to get clear off, that's all,' rejoined 

the locksmith.  'What happened when I reached home you may guess, 

if you didn't hear it.  Ah!  Well, it's a poor heart that never 

rejoices.--Put Toby this way, my dear.'



This Toby was the brown jug of which previous mention has been 

made.  Applying his lips to the worthy old gentleman's benevolent 

forehead, the locksmith, who had all this time been ravaging among 

the eatables, kept them there so long, at the same time raising the 

vessel slowly in the air, that at length Toby stood on his head 

upon his nose, when he smacked his lips, and set him on the table 

again with fond reluctance.



Although Sim Tappertit had taken no share in this conversation, no 

part of it being addressed to him, he had not been wanting in such 

silent manifestations of astonishment, as he deemed most compatible 

with the favourable display of his eyes.  Regarding the pause which 

now ensued, as a particularly advantageous opportunity for doing 

great execution with them upon the locksmith's daughter (who he had 

no doubt was looking at him in mute admiration), he began to screw 

and twist his face, and especially those features, into such 

extraordinary, hideous, and unparalleled contortions, that Gabriel, 

who happened to look towards him, was stricken with amazement.



'Why, what the devil's the matter with the lad?' cried the 

locksmith.  'Is he choking?'



'Who?' demanded Sim, with some disdain.



'Who?  Why, you,' returned his master.  'What do you mean by making 

those horrible faces over your breakfast?'



'Faces are matters of taste, sir,' said Mr Tappertit, rather 

discomfited; not the less so because he saw the locksmith's 

daughter smiling.



'Sim,' rejoined Gabriel, laughing heartily.  'Don't be a fool, for 

I'd rather see you in your senses.  These young fellows,' he added, 

turning to his daughter, 'are always committing some folly or 

another.  There was a quarrel between Joe Willet and old John last 

night though I can't say Joe was much in fault either.  He'll be 

missing one of these mornings, and will have gone away upon some 

wild-goose errand, seeking his fortune.--Why, what's the matter, 

Doll?  YOU are making faces now.  The girls are as bad as the boys 

every bit!'



'It's the tea,' said Dolly, turning alternately very red and very 

white, which is no doubt the effect of a slight scald--'so very hot.'



Mr Tappertit looked immensely big at a quartern loaf on the table, 

and breathed hard.



'Is that all?' returned the locksmith.  'Put some more milk in it.--

Yes, I am sorry for Joe, because he is a likely young fellow, and 

gains upon one every time one sees him.  But he'll start off, 

you'll find.  Indeed he told me as much himself!'



'Indeed!' cried Dolly in a faint voice.  'In-deed!'



'Is the tea tickling your throat still, my dear?' said the 

locksmith.



But, before his daughter could make him any answer, she was taken 

with a troublesome cough, and it was such a very unpleasant cough, 

that, when she left off, the tears were starting in her bright 

eyes.  The good-natured locksmith was still patting her on the back 

and applying such gentle restoratives, when a message arrived from 

Mrs Varden, making known to all whom it might concern, that she 

felt too much indisposed to rise after her great agitation and 

anxiety of the previous night; and therefore desired to be 

immediately accommodated with the little black teapot of strong 

mixed tea, a couple of rounds of buttered toast, a middling-sized 

dish of beef and ham cut thin, and the Protestant Manual in two 

volumes post octavo.  Like some other ladies who in remote ages 

flourished upon this globe, Mrs Varden was most devout when most 

ill-tempered.  Whenever she and her husband were at unusual 

variance, then the Protestant Manual was in high feather.



Knowing from experience what these requests portended, the 

triumvirate broke up; Dolly, to see the orders executed with all 

despatch; Gabriel, to some out-of-door work in his little chaise; 

and Sim, to his daily duty in the workshop, to which retreat he 

carried the big look, although the loaf remained behind.



Indeed the big look increased immensely, and when he had tied his 

apron on, became quite gigantic.  It was not until he had several 

times walked up and down with folded arms, and the longest strides 

be could take, and had kicked a great many small articles out of 

his way, that his lip began to curl.  At length, a gloomy derision 

came upon his features, and he smiled; uttering meanwhile with 

supreme contempt the monosyllable 'Joe!'



'I eyed her over, while he talked about the fellow,' he said, 'and 

that was of course the reason of her being confused.  Joe!'



He walked up and down again much quicker than before, and if 

possible with longer strides; sometimes stopping to take a glance 

at his legs, and sometimes to jerk out, and cast from him, another 

'Joe!'  In the course of a quarter of an hour or so he again 

assumed the paper cap and tried to work.  No.  It could not be 

done.



'I'll do nothing to-day,' said Mr Tappertit, dashing it down again, 

'but grind.  I'll grind up all the tools.  Grinding will suit my 

present humour well.  Joe!'



Whirr-r-r-r.  The grindstone was soon in motion; the sparks were 

flying off in showers.  This was the occupation for his heated 

spirit.



Whirr-r-r-r-r-r-r.



'Something will come of this!' said Mr Tappertit, pausing as if in 

triumph, and wiping his heated face upon his sleeve.  'Something 

will come of this.  I hope it mayn't be human gore!'



Whirr-r-r-r-r-r-r-r.
