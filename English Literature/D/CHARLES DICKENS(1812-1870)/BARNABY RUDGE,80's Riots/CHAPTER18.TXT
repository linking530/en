Gliding along the silent streets, and holding his course where they 

were darkest and most gloomy, the man who had left the widow's 

house crossed London Bridge, and arriving in the City, plunged into 

the backways, lanes, and courts, between Cornhill and Smithfield; 

with no more fixedness of purpose than to lose himself among their 

windings, and baffle pursuit, if any one were dogging his steps.



It was the dead time of the night, and all was quiet.  Now and then 

a drowsy watchman's footsteps sounded on the pavement, or the 

lamplighter on his rounds went flashing past, leaving behind a 

little track of smoke mingled with glowing morsels of his hot red 

link.  He hid himself even from these partakers of his lonely walk, 

and, shrinking in some arch or doorway while they passed, issued 

forth again when they were gone and so pursued his solitary way.



To be shelterless and alone in the open country, hearing the wind 

moan and watching for day through the whole long weary night; to 

listen to the falling rain, and crouch for warmth beneath the lee 

of some old barn or rick, or in the hollow of a tree; are dismal 

things--but not so dismal as the wandering up and down where 

shelter is, and beds and sleepers are by thousands; a houseless 

rejected creature.  To pace the echoing stones from hour to hour, 

counting the dull chimes of the clocks; to watch the lights 

twinkling in chamber windows, to think what happy forgetfulness 

each house shuts in; that here are children coiled together in 

their beds, here youth, here age, here poverty, here wealth, all 

equal in their sleep, and all at rest; to have nothing in common 

with the slumbering world around, not even sleep, Heaven's gift to 

all its creatures, and be akin to nothing but despair; to feel, by 

the wretched contrast with everything on every hand, more utterly 

alone and cast away than in a trackless desert; this is a kind of 

suffering, on which the rivers of great cities close full many a 

time, and which the solitude in crowds alone awakens.



The miserable man paced up and down the streets--so long, so 

wearisome, so like each other--and often cast a wistful look 

towards the east, hoping to see the first faint streaks of day.  

But obdurate night had yet possession of the sky, and his disturbed 

and restless walk found no relief.



One house in a back street was bright with the cheerful glare of 

lights; there was the sound of music in it too, and the tread of 

dancers, and there were cheerful voices, and many a burst of 

laughter.  To this place--to be near something that was awake and 

glad--he returned again and again; and more than one of those who 

left it when the merriment was at its height, felt it a check upon 

their mirthful mood to see him flitting to and fro like an uneasy 

ghost.  At last the guests departed, one and all; and then the 

house was close shut up, and became as dull and silent as the rest.



His wanderings brought him at one time to the city jail.  Instead 

of hastening from it as a place of ill omen, and one he had cause 

to shun, he sat down on some steps hard by, and resting his chin 

upon his hand, gazed upon its rough and frowning walls as though 

even they became a refuge in his jaded eyes.  He paced it round and 

round, came back to the same spot, and sat down again.  He did this 

often, and once, with a hasty movement, crossed to where some men 

were watching in the prison lodge, and had his foot upon the steps 

as though determined to accost them.  But looking round, he saw 

that the day began to break, and failing in his purpose, turned and 

fled.



He was soon in the quarter he had lately traversed, and pacing to 

and fro again as he had done before.  He was passing down a mean 

street, when from an alley close at hand some shouts of revelry 

arose, and there came straggling forth a dozen madcaps, whooping 

and calling to each other, who, parting noisily, took different 

ways and dispersed in smaller groups.



Hoping that some low place of entertainment which would afford him 

a safe refuge might be near at hand, he turned into this court when 

they were all gone, and looked about for a half-opened door, or 

lighted window, or other indication of the place whence they had 

come.  It was so profoundly dark, however, and so ill-favoured, 

that he concluded they had but turned up there, missing their way, 

and were pouring out again when he observed them.  With this 

impression, and finding there was no outlet but that by which he 

had entered, he was about to turn, when from a grating near his 

feet a sudden stream of light appeared, and the sound of talking 

came.  He retreated into a doorway to see who these talkers were, 

and to listen to them.



The light came to the level of the pavement as he did this, and a 

man ascended, bearing in his hand a torch.  This figure unlocked 

and held open the grating as for the passage of another, who 

presently appeared, in the form of a young man of small stature and 

uncommon self-importance, dressed in an obsolete and very gaudy 

fashion.



'Good night, noble captain,' said he with the torch.  'Farewell, 

commander.  Good luck, illustrious general!'



In return to these compliments the other bade him hold his tongue, 

and keep his noise to himself, and laid upon him many similar 

injunctions, with great fluency of speech and sternness of manner.



'Commend me, captain, to the stricken Miggs,' returned the torch-

bearer in a lower voice.  'My captain flies at higher game than 

Miggses.  Ha, ha, ha!  My captain is an eagle, both as respects his 

eye and soaring wings.  My captain breaketh hearts as other 

bachelors break eggs at breakfast.'



'What a fool you are, Stagg!' said Mr Tappertit, stepping on the 

pavement of the court, and brushing from his legs the dust he had 

contracted in his passage upward.



'His precious limbs!' cried Stagg, clasping one of his ankles.  

'Shall a Miggs aspire to these proportions!  No, no, my captain.  

We will inveigle ladies fair, and wed them in our secret cavern.  

We will unite ourselves with blooming beauties, captain.'



'I'll tell you what, my buck,' said Mr Tappertit, releasing his 

leg; 'I'll trouble you not to take liberties, and not to broach 

certain questions unless certain questions are broached to you.  

Speak when you're spoke to on particular subjects, and not 

otherways.  Hold the torch up till I've got to the end of the 

court, and then kennel yourself, do you hear?'



'I hear you, noble captain.'



'Obey then,' said Mr Tappertit haughtily.  'Gentlemen, lead on!'  

With which word of command (addressed to an imaginary staff or 

retinue) he folded his arms, and walked with surpassing dignity 

down the court.



His obsequious follower stood holding the torch above his head, and 

then the observer saw for the first time, from his place of 

concealment, that he was blind.  Some involuntary motion on his 

part caught the quick ear of the blind man, before he was conscious 

of having moved an inch towards him, for he turned suddenly and 

cried, 'Who's there?'



'A man,' said the other, advancing.  'A friend.'



'A stranger!' rejoined the blind man.  'Strangers are not my 

friends.  What do you do there?'



'I saw your company come out, and waited here till they were gone.  

I want a lodging.'



'A lodging at this time!' returned Stagg, pointing towards the dawn 

as though he saw it.  'Do you know the day is breaking?'



'I know it,' rejoined the other, 'to my cost.  I have been 

traversing this iron-hearted town all night.'



'You had better traverse it again,' said the blind man, preparing 

to descend, 'till you find some lodgings suitable to your taste.  I 

don't let any.'



'Stay!' cried the other, holding him by the arm.



'I'll beat this light about that hangdog face of yours (for hangdog 

it is, if it answers to your voice), and rouse the neighbourhood 

besides, if you detain me,' said the blind man.  'Let me go.  Do 

you hear?'



'Do YOU hear!' returned the other, chinking a few shillings 

together, and hurriedly pressing them into his hand.  'I beg 

nothing of you.  I will pay for the shelter you give me.  Death!  

Is it much to ask of such as you!  I have come from the country, 

and desire to rest where there are none to question me.  I am 

faint, exhausted, worn out, almost dead.  Let me lie down, like a 

dog, before your fire.  I ask no more than that.  If you would be 

rid of me, I will depart to-morrow.'



'If a gentleman has been unfortunate on the road,' muttered Stagg, 

yielding to the other, who, pressing on him, had already gained a 

footing on the steps--'and can pay for his accommodation--'



'I will pay you with all I have.  I am just now past the want of 

food, God knows, and wish but to purchase shelter.  What companion 

have you below?'



'None.'



'Then fasten your grate there, and show me the way.  Quick!'



The blind man complied after a moment's hesitation, and they 

descended together.  The dialogue had passed as hurriedly as the 

words could be spoken, and they stood in his wretched room before 

he had had time to recover from his first surprise.



'May I see where that door leads to, and what is beyond?' said the 

man, glancing keenly round.  'You will not mind that?'



'I will show you myself.  Follow me, or go before.  Take your 

choice.'



He bade him lead the way, and, by the light of the torch which his 

conductor held up for the purpose, inspected all three cellars 

narrowly.  Assured that the blind man had spoken truth, and that he 

lived there alone, the visitor returned with him to the first, in 

which a fire was burning, and flung himself with a deep groan upon 

the ground before it.



His host pursued his usual occupation without seeming to heed him 

any further.  But directly he fell asleep--and he noted his falling 

into a slumber, as readily as the keenest-sighted man could have 

done--he knelt down beside him, and passed his hand lightly but 

carefully over his face and person.



His sleep was checkered with starts and moans, and sometimes with a 

muttered word or two.  His hands were clenched, his brow bent, and 

his mouth firmly set.  All this, the blind man accurately marked; 

and as if his curiosity were strongly awakened, and he had already 

some inkling of his mystery, he sat watching him, if the expression 

may be used, and listening, until it was broad day.
