A month has elapsed,--and we stand in the bedchamber of Sir John 

Chester.  Through the half-opened window, the Temple Garden looks 

green and pleasant; the placid river, gay with boat and barge, and 

dimpled with the plash of many an oar, sparkles in the distance; 

the sky is blue and clear; and the summer air steals gently in, 

filling the room with perfume.  The very town, the smoky town, is 

radiant.  High roofs and steeple-tops, wont to look black and 

sullen, smile a cheerful grey; every old gilded vane, and ball, and 

cross, glitters anew in the bright morning sun; and, high among 

them all, St Paul's towers up, showing its lofty crest in burnished 

gold.



Sir John was breakfasting in bed.  His chocolate and toast stood 

upon a little table at his elbow; books and newspapers lay ready to 

his hand, upon the coverlet; and, sometimes pausing to glance with 

an air of tranquil satisfaction round the well-ordered room, and 

sometimes to gaze indolently at the summer sky, he ate, and drank, 

and read the news luxuriously.



The cheerful influence of the morning seemed to have some effect, 

even upon his equable temper.  His manner was unusually gay; his 

smile more placid and agreeable than usual; his voice more clear 

and pleasant.  He laid down the newspaper he had been reading; 

leaned back upon his pillow with the air of one who resigned 

himself to a train of charming recollections; and after a pause, 

soliloquised as follows:



'And my friend the centaur, goes the way of his mamma!  I am not 

surprised.  And his mysterious friend Mr Dennis, likewise!  I am 

not surprised.  And my old postman, the exceedingly free-and-easy 

young madman of Chigwell!  I am quite rejoiced.  It's the very best 

thing that could possibly happen to him.'



After delivering himself of these remarks, he fell again into his 

smiling train of reflection; from which he roused himself at length 

to finish his chocolate, which was getting cold, and ring the bell 

for more.



The new supply arriving, he took the cup from his servant's hand; 

and saying, with a charming affability, 'I am obliged to you, 

Peak,' dismissed him.



'It is a remarkable circumstance,' he mused, dallying lazily with 

the teaspoon, 'that my friend the madman should have been within an 

ace of escaping, on his trial; and it was a good stroke of chance 

(or, as the world would say, a providential occurrence) that the 

brother of my Lord Mayor should have been in court, with other 

country justices, into whose very dense heads curiosity had 

penetrated.  For though the brother of my Lord Mayor was decidedly 

wrong; and established his near relationship to that amusing person 

beyond all doubt, in stating that my friend was sane, and had, to 

his knowledge, wandered about the country with a vagabond parent, 

avowing revolutionary and rebellious sentiments; I am not the less 

obliged to him for volunteering that evidence.  These insane 

creatures make such very odd and embarrassing remarks, that they 

really ought to be hanged for the comfort of society.'



The country justice had indeed turned the wavering scale against 

poor Barnaby, and solved the doubt that trembled in his favour.  

Grip little thought how much he had to answer for.



'They will be a singular party,' said Sir John, leaning his head 

upon his hand, and sipping his chocolate; 'a very curious party.  

The hangman himself; the centaur; and the madman.  The centaur 

would make a very handsome preparation in Surgeons' Hall, and 

would benefit science extremely.  I hope they have taken care to 

bespeak him.--Peak, I am not at home, of course, to anybody but the 

hairdresser.'



This reminder to his servant was called forth by a knock at the 

door, which the man hastened to open.  After a prolonged murmur of 

question and answer, he returned; and as he cautiously closed the 

room-door behind him, a man was heard to cough in the passage.



'Now, it is of no use, Peak,' said Sir John, raising his hand in 

deprecation of his delivering any message; 'I am not at home.  I 

cannot possibly hear you.  I told you I was not at home, and my 

word is sacred.  Will you never do as you are desired?'



Having nothing to oppose to this reproof, the man was about to 

withdraw, when the visitor who had given occasion to it, probably 

rendered impatient by delay, knocked with his knuckles at the 

chamber-door, and called out that he had urgent business with Sir 

John Chester, which admitted of no delay.



'Let him in,' said Sir John.  'My good fellow,' he added, when the 

door was opened, 'how come you to intrude yourself in this 

extraordinary manner upon the privacy of a gentleman?  How can you 

be so wholly destitute of self-respect as to be guilty of such 

remarkable ill-breeding?'



'My business, Sir John, is not of a common kind, I do assure you,' 

returned the person he addressed.  'If I have taken any uncommon 

course to get admission to you, I hope I shall be pardoned on that 

account.'



'Well! we shall see; we shall see,' returned Sir John, whose face 

cleared up when he saw who it was, and whose prepossessing smile 

was now restored.  'I am sure we have met before,' he added in his 

winning tone, 'but really I forget your name?'



'My name is Gabriel Varden, sir.'



'Varden, of course, Varden,' returned Sir John, tapping his 

forehead.  'Dear me, how very defective my memory becomes!  Varden 

to be sure--Mr Varden the locksmith.  You have a charming wife, Mr 

Varden, and a most beautiful daughter.  They are well?'



Gabriel thanked him, and said they were.



'I rejoice to hear it,' said Sir John.  'Commend me to them when 

you return, and say that I wished I were fortunate enough to 

convey, myself, the salute which I entrust you to deliver.  And 

what,' he asked very sweetly, after a moment's pause, 'can I do for 

you?  You may command me freely.'



'I thank you, Sir John,' said Gabriel, with some pride in his 

manner, 'but I have come to ask no favour of you, though I come on 

business.--Private,' he added, with a glance at the man who stood 

looking on, 'and very pressing business.'



'I cannot say you are the more welcome for being independent, and 

having nothing to ask of me,' returned Sir John, graciously, 'for I 

should have been happy to render you a service; still, you are 

welcome on any terms.  Oblige me with some more chocolate, Peak, 

and don't wait.'



The man retired, and left them alone.



'Sir John,' said Gabriel, 'I am a working-man, and have been so, 

all my life.  If I don't prepare you enough for what I have to 

tell; if I come to the point too abruptly; and give you a shock, 

which a gentleman could have spared you, or at all events lessened 

very much; I hope you will give me credit for meaning well.  I wish 

to be careful and considerate, and I trust that in a straightforward 

person like me, you'll take the will for the deed.'



'Mr Varden,' returned the other, perfectly composed under this 

exordium; 'I beg you'll take a chair.  Chocolate, perhaps, you 

don't relish?  Well! it IS an acquired taste, no doubt.'



'Sir John,' said Gabriel, who had acknowledged with a bow the 

invitation to be seated, but had not availed himself of it.  'Sir 

John'--he dropped his voice and drew nearer to the bed--'I am just 

now come from Newgate--'



'Good Gad!' cried Sir John, hastily sitting up in bed; 'from 

Newgate, Mr Varden!  How could you be so very imprudent as to come 

from Newgate!  Newgate, where there are jail-fevers, and ragged 

people, and bare-footed men and women, and a thousand horrors!  

Peak, bring the camphor, quick!  Heaven and earth, Mr Varden, my 

dear, good soul, how COULD you come from Newgate?'



Gabriel returned no answer, but looked on in silence while Peak 

(who had entered with the hot chocolate) ran to a drawer, and 

returning with a bottle, sprinkled his master's dressing-gown and 


the bedding; and besides moistening the locksmith himself, 

plentifully, described a circle round about him on the carpet.  

When he had done this, he again retired; and Sir John, reclining in 

an easy attitude upon his pillow, once more turned a smiling face 

towards his visitor.



'You will forgive me, Mr Varden, I am sure, for being at first a 

little sensitive both on your account and my own.  I confess I was 

startled, notwithstanding your delicate exordium.  Might I ask you 

to do me the favour not to approach any nearer?--You have really 

come from Newgate!'



The locksmith inclined his head.



'In-deed!  And now, Mr Varden, all exaggeration and embellishment 

apart,' said Sir John Chester, confidentially, as he sipped his 

chocolate, 'what kind of place IS Newgate?'



'A strange place, Sir John,' returned the locksmith, 'of a sad and 

doleful kind.  A strange place, where many strange things are heard 

and seen; but few more strange than that I come to tell you of.  

The case is urgent.  I am sent here.'



'Not--no, no--not from the jail?'



'Yes, Sir John; from the jail.'



'And my good, credulous, open-hearted friend,' said Sir John, 

setting down his cup, and laughing,--'by whom?'



'By a man called Dennis--for many years the hangman, and to-morrow 

morning the hanged,' returned the locksmith.



Sir John had expected--had been quite certain from the first--that 

he would say he had come from Hugh, and was prepared to meet him on 

that point.  But this answer occasioned him a degree of 

astonishment, which, for the moment, he could not, with all his 

command of feature, prevent his face from expressing.  He quickly 

subdued it, however, and said in the same light tone:



'And what does the gentleman require of me?  My memory may be at 

fault again, but I don't recollect that I ever had the pleasure of 

an introduction to him, or that I ever numbered him among my 

personal friends, I do assure you, Mr Varden.'



'Sir John,' returned the locksmith, gravely, 'I will tell you, as 

nearly as I can, in the words he used to me, what he desires that 

you should know, and what you ought to know without a moment's loss 

of time.'



Sir John Chester settled himself in a position of greater repose, 

and looked at his visitor with an expression of face which seemed 

to say, 'This is an amusing fellow!  I'll hear him out.'



'You may have seen in the newspapers, sir,' said Gabriel, pointing 

to the one which lay by his side, 'that I was a witness against 

this man upon his trial some days since; and that it was not his 

fault I was alive, and able to speak to what I knew.'



'MAY have seen!' cried Sir John.  'My dear Mr Varden, you are quite 

a public character, and live in all men's thoughts most deservedly.  

Nothing can exceed the interest with which I read your testimony, 

and remembered that I had the pleasure of a slight acquaintance 

with you.---I hope we shall have your portrait published?'



'This morning, sir,' said the locksmith, taking no notice of these 

compliments, 'early this morning, a message was brought to me from 

Newgate, at this man's request, desiring that I would go and see 

him, for he had something particular to communicate.  I needn't 

tell you that he is no friend of mine, and that I had never seen 

him, until the rioters beset my house.'



Sir John fanned himself gently with the newspaper, and nodded.



'I knew, however, from the general report,' resumed Gabriel, 'that 

the order for his execution to-morrow, went down to the prison 

last night; and looking upon him as a dying man, I complied with 

his request.'



'You are quite a Christian, Mr Varden,' said Sir John; 'and in that 

amiable capacity, you increase my desire that you should take a 

chair.'



'He said,' continued Gabriel, looking steadily at the knight, 'that 

he had sent to me, because he had no friend or companion in the 

whole world (being the common hangman), and because he believed, 

from the way in which I had given my evidence, that I was an honest 

man, and would act truly by him.  He said that, being shunned by 

every one who knew his calling, even by people of the lowest and 

most wretched grade, and finding, when he joined the rioters, that 

the men he acted with had no suspicion of it (which I believe is 

true enough, for a poor fool of an old 'prentice of mine was one of 

them), he had kept his own counsel, up to the time of his being 

taken and put in jail.'



'Very discreet of Mr Dennis,' observed Sir John with a slight yawn, 

though still with the utmost affability, 'but--except for your 

admirable and lucid manner of telling it, which is perfect--not 

very interesting to me.'



'When,' pursued the locksmith, quite unabashed and wholly 

regardless of these interruptions, 'when he was taken to the jail, 

he found that his fellow-prisoner, in the same room, was a young 

man, Hugh by name, a leader in the riots, who had been betrayed and 

given up by himself.  From something which fell from this unhappy 

creature in the course of the angry words they had at meeting, he 

discovered that his mother had suffered the death to which they 

both are now condemned.--The time is very short, Sir John.'



The knight laid down his paper fan, replaced his cup upon the table 

at his side, and, saving for the smile that lurked about his mouth, 

looked at the locksmith with as much steadiness as the locksmith 

looked at him.



'They have been in prison now, a month.  One conversation led to 

many more; and the hangman soon found, from a comparison of time, 

and place, and dates, that he had executed the sentence of the law 

upon this woman, himself.  She had been tempted by want--as so many 

people are--into the easy crime of passing forged notes.  She was 

young and handsome; and the traders who employ men, women, and 

children in this traffic, looked upon her as one who was well 

adapted for their business, and who would probably go on without 

suspicion for a long time.  But they were mistaken; for she was 

stopped in the commission of her very first offence, and died for 

it.  She was of gipsy blood, Sir John--'



It might have been the effect of a passing cloud which obscured the 

sun, and cast a shadow on his face; but the knight turned deadly 

pale.  Still he met the locksmith's eye, as before.



'She was of gipsy blood, Sir John,' repeated Gabriel, 'and had a 

high, free spirit.  This, and her good looks, and her lofty manner, 

interested some gentlemen who were easily moved by dark eyes; and 

efforts were made to save her.  They might have been successful, if 

she would have given them any clue to her history.  But she never 

would, or did.  There was reason to suspect that she would make an 

attempt upon her life.  A watch was set upon her night and day; and 

from that time she never spoke again--'



Sir John stretched out his hand towards his cup.  The locksmith 

going on, arrested it half-way.



--'Until she had but a minute to live.  Then she broke silence, and 

said, in a low firm voice which no one heard but this executioner, 

for all other living creatures had retired and left her to her 

fate, "If I had a dagger within these fingers and he was within my 

reach, I would strike him dead before me, even now!"  The man asked 

"Who?"  She said, "The father of her boy."'



Sir John drew back his outstretched hand, and seeing that the 

locksmith paused, signed to him with easy politeness and without 

any new appearance of emotion, to proceed.



'It was the first word she had ever spoken, from which it could be 

understood that she had any relative on earth.  "Was the child 

alive?" he asked.  "Yes."  He asked her where it was, its name, and 

whether she had any wish respecting it.  She had but one, she said.  

It was that the boy might live and grow, in utter ignorance of his 

father, so that no arts might teach him to be gentle and 

forgiving.  When he became a man, she trusted to the God of their 

tribe to bring the father and the son together, and revenge her 

through her child.  He asked her other questions, but she spoke no 

more.  Indeed, he says, she scarcely said this much, to him, but 

stood with her face turned upwards to the sky, and never looked 

towards him once.'



Sir John took a pinch of snuff; glanced approvingly at an elegant 

little sketch, entitled 'Nature,' on the wall; and raising his eyes 

to the locksmith's face again, said, with an air of courtesy and 

patronage, 'You were observing, Mr Varden--'



'That she never,' returned the locksmith, who was not to be 

diverted by any artifice from his firm manner, and his steady gaze, 

'that she never looked towards him once, Sir John; and so she died, 

and he forgot her.  But, some years afterwards, a man was 

sentenced to die the same death, who was a gipsy too; a sunburnt, 

swarthy fellow, almost a wild man; and while he lay in prison, 

under sentence, he, who had seen the hangman more than once while 

he was free, cut an image of him on his stick, by way of braving 

death, and showing those who attended on him, how little he cared 

or thought about it.  He gave this stick into his hands at Tyburn, 

and told him then, that the woman I have spoken of had left her own 

people to join a fine gentleman, and that, being deserted by him, 

and cast off by her old friends, she had sworn within her own proud 

breast, that whatever her misery might be, she would ask no help of 

any human being.  He told him that she had kept her word to the 

last; and that, meeting even him in the streets--he had been fond 

of her once, it seems--she had slipped from him by a trick, and he 

never saw her again, until, being in one of the frequent crowds at 

Tyburn, with some of his rough companions, he had been driven 

almost mad by seeing, in the criminal under another name, whose 

death he had come to witness, herself.  Standing in the same place 

in which she had stood, he told the hangman this, and told him, 

too, her real name, which only her own people and the gentleman for 

whose sake she had left them, knew.  That name he will tell again, 

Sir John, to none but you.'



'To none but me!' exclaimed the knight, pausing in the act of 

raising his cup to his lips with a perfectly steady hand, and 

curling up his little finger for the better display of a brilliant 

ring with which it was ornamented: 'but me!--My dear Mr Varden, 

how very preposterous, to select me for his confidence!  With you 

at his elbow, too, who are so perfectly trustworthy!'



'Sir John, Sir John,' returned the locksmith, 'at twelve tomorrow, 

these men die.  Hear the few words I have to add, and do not hope 

to deceive me; for though I am a plain man of humble station, and 

you are a gentleman of rank and learning, the truth raises me to 

your level, and I KNOW that you anticipate the disclosure with 

which I am about to end, and that you believe this doomed man, 

Hugh, to be your son.'



'Nay,' said Sir John, bantering him with a gay air; 'the wild 

gentleman, who died so suddenly, scarcely went as far as that, I 

think?'



'He did not,' returned the locksmith, 'for she had bound him by 

some pledge, known only to these people, and which the worst among 

them respect, not to tell your name: but, in a fantastic pattern on 

the stick, he had carved some letters, and when the hangman asked 

it, he bade him, especially if he should ever meet with her son in 

after life, remember that place well.'



'What place?'



'Chester.'



The knight finished his cup of chocolate with an appearance of 

infinite relish, and carefully wiped his lips upon his 

handkerchief.



'Sir John,' said the locksmith, 'this is all that has been told to 

me; but since these two men have been left for death, they have 

conferred together closely.  See them, and hear what they can add.  

See this Dennis, and learn from him what he has not trusted to me.  

If you, who hold the clue to all, want corroboration (which you do 

not), the means are easy.'



'And to what,' said Sir John Chester, rising on his elbow, after 

smoothing the pillow for its reception; 'my dear, good-natured, 

estimable Mr Varden--with whom I cannot be angry if I would--to 

what does all this tend?'



'I take you for a man, Sir John, and I suppose it tends to some 

pleading of natural affection in your breast,' returned the 

locksmith.  'I suppose to the straining of every nerve, and the 

exertion of all the influence you have, or can make, in behalf of 

your miserable son, and the man who has disclosed his existence to 

you.  At the worst, I suppose to your seeing your son, and 

awakening him to a sense of his crime and danger.  He has no such 

sense now.  Think what his life must have been, when he said in my 

hearing, that if I moved you to anything, it would be to hastening 

his death, and ensuring his silence, if you had it in your power!'



'And have you, my good Mr Varden,' said Sir John in a tone of mild 

reproof, 'have you really lived to your present age, and remained 

so very simple and credulous, as to approach a gentleman of 

established character with such credentials as these, from 

desperate men in their last extremity, catching at any straw?  Oh 

dear!  Oh fie, fie!'



The locksmith was going to interpose, but he stopped him:



'On any other subject, Mr Varden, I shall be delighted--I shall be 

charmed--to converse with you, but I owe it to my own character not 

to pursue this topic for another moment.'



'Think better of it, sir, when I am gone,' returned the locksmith; 

'think better of it, sir.  Although you have, thrice within as many 

weeks, turned your lawful son, Mr Edward, from your door, you may 

have time, you may have years to make your peace with HIM, Sir 

John: but that twelve o'clock will soon be here, and soon be past 

for ever.'



'I thank you very much,' returned the knight, kissing his delicate 

hand to the locksmith, 'for your guileless advice; and I only wish, 

my good soul, although your simplicity is quite captivating, that 

you had a little more worldly wisdom.  I never so much regretted 

the arrival of my hairdresser as I do at this moment.  God bless 

you!  Good morning!  You'll not forget my message to the ladies, Mr 

Varden?  Peak, show Mr Varden to the door.'



Gabriel said no more, but gave the knight a parting look, and left 

him.  As he quitted the room, Sir John's face changed; and the 

smile gave place to a haggard and anxious expression, like that of 

a weary actor jaded by the performance of a difficult part.  He 

rose from his bed with a heavy sigh, and wrapped himself in his 

morning-gown.



'So she kept her word,' he said, 'and was constant to her threat!  

I would I had never seen that dark face of hers,--I might have read 

these consequences in it, from the first.  This affair would make a 

noise abroad, if it rested on better evidence; but, as it is, and 

by not joining the scattered links of the chain, I can afford to 

slight it.--Extremely distressing to be the parent of such an 

uncouth creature!  Still, I gave him very good advice.  I told him 

he would certainly be hanged.  I could have done no more if I had 

known of our relationship; and there are a great many fathers who 

have never done as much for THEIR natural children.--The 

hairdresser may come in, Peak!'



The hairdresser came in; and saw in Sir John Chester (whose 

accommodating conscience was soon quieted by the numerous 

precedents that occurred to him in support of his last 

observation), the same imperturbable, fascinating, elegant 

gentleman he had seen yesterday, and many yesterdays before.
