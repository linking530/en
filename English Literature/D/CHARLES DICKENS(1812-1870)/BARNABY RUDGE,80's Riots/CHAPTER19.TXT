Dolly Varden's pretty little head was yet bewildered by various 

recollections of the party, and her bright eyes were yet dazzled by 

a crowd of images, dancing before them like motes in the sunbeams, 

among which the effigy of one partner in particular did especially 

figure, the same being a young coachmaker (a master in his own 

right) who had given her to understand, when he handed her into the 

chair at parting, that it was his fixed resolve to neglect his 

business from that time, and die slowly for the love of her--

Dolly's head, and eyes, and thoughts, and seven senses, were all in 

a state of flutter and confusion for which the party was 

accountable, although it was now three days old, when, as she was 

sitting listlessly at breakfast, reading all manner of fortunes 

(that is to say, of married and flourishing fortunes) in the 

grounds of her teacup, a step was heard in the workshop, and Mr 

Edward Chester was descried through the glass door, standing among 

the rusty locks and keys, like love among the roses--for which apt 

comparison the historian may by no means take any credit to 

himself, the same being the invention, in a sentimental mood, of 

the chaste and modest Miggs, who, beholding him from the doorsteps 

she was then cleaning, did, in her maiden meditation, give 

utterance to the simile.



The locksmith, who happened at the moment to have his eyes thrown 

upward and his head backward, in an intense communing with Toby, 

did not see his visitor, until Mrs Varden, more watchful than the 

rest, had desired Sim Tappertit to open the glass door and give him 

admission--from which untoward circumstance the good lady argued 

(for she could deduce a precious moral from the most trifling 

event) that to take a draught of small ale in the morning was to 

observe a pernicious, irreligious, and Pagan custom, the relish 

whereof should be left to swine, and Satan, or at least to Popish 

persons, and should be shunned by the righteous as a work of sin 

and evil.  She would no doubt have pursued her admonition much 

further, and would have founded on it a long list of precious 

precepts of inestimable value, but that the young gentleman 

standing by in a somewhat uncomfortable and discomfited manner 

while she read her spouse this lecture, occasioned her to bring it 

to a premature conclusion.



'I'm sure you'll excuse me, sir,' said Mrs Varden, rising and 

curtseying.  'Varden is so very thoughtless, and needs so much 

reminding--Sim, bring a chair here.'



Mr Tappertit obeyed, with a flourish implying that he did so, 

under protest.



'And you can go, Sim,' said the locksmith.



Mr Tappertit obeyed again, still under protest; and betaking 

himself to the workshop, began seriously to fear that he might find 

it necessary to poison his master, before his time was out.



In the meantime, Edward returned suitable replies to Mrs Varden's 

courtesies, and that lady brightened up very much; so that when he 

accepted a dish of tea from the fair hands of Dolly, she was 

perfectly agreeable.



'I am sure if there's anything we can do,--Varden, or I, or Dolly 

either,--to serve you, sir, at any time, you have only to say it, 

and it shall be done,' said Mrs V.



'I am much obliged to you, I am sure,' returned Edward.  'You 

encourage me to say that I have come here now, to beg your good 

offices.'



Mrs Varden was delighted beyond measure.



'It occurred to me that probably your fair daughter might be going 

to the Warren, either to-day or to-morrow,' said Edward, glancing 

at Dolly; 'and if so, and you will allow her to take charge of this 

letter, ma'am, you will oblige me more than I can tell you.  The 

truth is, that while I am very anxious it should reach its 

destination, I have particular reasons for not trusting it to any 

other conveyance; so that without your help, I am wholly at a loss.'



'She was not going that way, sir, either to-day, or to-morrow, nor 

indeed all next week,' the lady graciously rejoined, 'but we shall 

be very glad to put ourselves out of the way on your account, and 

if you wish it, you may depend upon its going to-day.  You might 

suppose,' said Mrs Varden, frowning at her husband, 'from Varden's 

sitting there so glum and silent, that he objected to this 

arrangement; but you must not mind that, sir, if you please.  It's 

his way at home.  Out of doors, he can be cheerful and talkative 

enough.'



Now, the fact was, that the unfortunate locksmith, blessing his 

stars to find his helpmate in such good humour, had been sitting 

with a beaming face, hearing this discourse with a joy past all 

expression.  Wherefore this sudden attack quite took him by 

surprise.



'My dear Martha--' he said.



'Oh yes, I dare say,' interrupted Mrs Varden, with a smile of 

mingled scorn and pleasantry.  'Very dear!  We all know that.'



'No, but my good soul,' said Gabriel, 'you are quite mistaken.  You 

are indeed.  I was delighted to find you so kind and ready.  I 

waited, my dear, anxiously, I assure you, to hear what you would 

say.'



'You waited anxiously,' repeated Mrs V.  'Yes!  Thank you, Varden.  

You waited, as you always do, that I might bear the blame, if any 

came of it.  But I am used to it,' said the lady with a kind of 

solemn titter, 'and that's my comfort!'



'I give you my word, Martha--' said Gabriel.



'Let me give you MY word, my dear,' interposed his wife with a 

Christian smile, 'that such discussions as these between married 

people, are much better left alone.  Therefore, if you please, 

Varden, we'll drop the subject.  I have no wish to pursue it.  I 

could.  I might say a great deal.  But I would rather not.  Pray 

don't say any more.'



'I don't want to say any more,' rejoined the goaded locksmith.



'Well then, don't,' said Mrs Varden.



'Nor did I begin it, Martha,' added the locksmith, good-humouredly, 

'I must say that.'



'You did not begin it, Varden!' exclaimed his wife, opening her 

eyes very wide and looking round upon the company, as though she 

would say, You hear this man!  'You did not begin it, Varden!  But 

you shall not say I was out of temper.  No, you did not begin it, 

oh dear no, not you, my dear!'



'Well, well,' said the locksmith.  'That's settled then.'



'Oh yes,' rejoined his wife, 'quite.  If you like to say Dolly 

began it, my dear, I shall not contradict you.  I know my duty.  I 

need know it, I am sure.  I am often obliged to bear it in mind, 

when my inclination perhaps would be for the moment to forget it.  

Thank you, Varden.'  And so, with a mighty show of humility and 

forgiveness, she folded her hands, and looked round again, with a 

smile which plainly said, 'If you desire to see the first and 

foremost among female martyrs, here she is, on view!'



This little incident, illustrative though it was of Mrs Varden's 

extraordinary sweetness and amiability, had so strong a tendency to 

check the conversation and to disconcert all parties but that 

excellent lady, that only a few monosyllables were uttered until 

Edward withdrew; which he presently did, thanking the lady of the 

house a great many times for her condescension, and whispering in 

Dolly's ear that he would call on the morrow, in case there should 

happen to be an answer to the note--which, indeed, she knew without 

his telling, as Barnaby and his friend Grip had dropped in on the 

previous night to prepare her for the visit which was then 

terminating.



Gabriel, who had attended Edward to the door, came back with his 

hands in his pockets; and, after fidgeting about the room in a very 

uneasy manner, and casting a great many sidelong looks at Mrs 

Varden (who with the calmest countenance in the world was five 

fathoms deep in the Protestant Manual), inquired of Dolly how she 

meant to go.  Dolly supposed by the stage-coach, and looked at her 

lady mother, who finding herself silently appealed to, dived down 

at least another fathom into the Manual, and became unconscious of 

all earthly things.



'Martha--' said the locksmith.



'I hear you, Varden,' said his wife, without rising to the surface.



'I am sorry, my dear, you have such an objection to the Maypole and 

old John, for otherways as it's a very fine morning, and Saturday's 

not a busy day with us, we might have all three gone to Chigwell in 

the chaise, and had quite a happy day of it.'



Mrs Varden immediately closed the Manual, and bursting into tears, 

requested to be led upstairs.



'What is the matter now, Martha?' inquired the locksmith.



To which Martha rejoined, 'Oh! don't speak to me,' and protested in 

agony that if anybody had told her so, she wouldn't have believed 

it.



'But, Martha,' said Gabriel, putting himself in the way as she was 

moving off with the aid of Dolly's shoulder, 'wouldn't have 

believed what?  Tell me what's wrong now.  Do tell me.  Upon my 

soul I don't know.  Do you know, child?  Damme!' cried the 

locksmith, plucking at his wig in a kind of frenzy, 'nobody does 

know, I verily believe, but Miggs!'



'Miggs,' said Mrs Varden faintly, and with symptoms of approaching 

incoherence, 'is attached to me, and that is sufficient to draw 

down hatred upon her in this house.  She is a comfort to me, 

whatever she may be to others.'



'She's no comfort to me,' cried Gabriel, made bold by despair.  

'She's the misery of my life.  She's all the plagues of Egypt in 

one.'



'She's considered so, I have no doubt,' said Mrs Varden.  'I was 

prepared for that; it's natural; it's of a piece with the rest.  

When you taunt me as you do to my face, how can I wonder that you 

taunt her behind her back!'  And here the incoherence coming on 

very strong, Mrs Varden wept, and laughed, and sobbed, and 

shivered, and hiccoughed, and choked; and said she knew it was very 

foolish but she couldn't help it; and that when she was dead and 

gone, perhaps they would be sorry for it--which really under the 

circumstances did not appear quite so probable as she seemed to 

think--with a great deal more to the same effect.  In a word, she 

passed with great decency through all the ceremonies incidental to 

such occasions; and being supported upstairs, was deposited in a 

highly spasmodic state on her own bed, where Miss Miggs shortly 

afterwards flung herself upon the body.



The philosophy of all this was, that Mrs Varden wanted to go to 

Chigwell; that she did not want to make any concession or 

explanation; that she would only go on being implored and entreated 

so to do; and that she would accept no other terms.  Accordingly, 

after a vast amount of moaning and crying upstairs, and much 

damping of foreheads, and vinegaring of temples, and hartshorning 

of noses, and so forth; and after most pathetic adjurations from 

Miggs, assisted by warm brandy-and-water not over-weak, and divers 

other cordials, also of a stimulating quality, administered at 

first in teaspoonfuls and afterwards in increasing doses, and of 

which Miss Miggs herself partook as a preventive measure (for 

fainting is infectious); after all these remedies, and many more 

too numerous to mention, but not to take, had been applied; and 

many verbal consolations, moral, religious, and miscellaneous, had 

been super-added thereto; the locksmith humbled himself, and the 

end was gained.



'If it's only for the sake of peace and quietness, father,' said 

Dolly, urging him to go upstairs.



'Oh, Doll, Doll,' said her good-natured father.  'If you ever have 

a husband of your own--'



Dolly glanced at the glass.



'--Well, WHEN you have,' said the locksmith, 'never faint, my 

darling.  More domestic unhappiness has come of easy fainting, 

Doll, than from all the greater passions put together.  Remember 

that, my dear, if you would be really happy, which you never can 

be, if your husband isn't.  And a word in your ear, my precious.  

Never have a Miggs about you!'



With this advice he kissed his blooming daughter on the cheek, and 

slowly repaired to Mrs Varden's room; where that lady, lying all 

pale and languid on her couch, was refreshing herself with a sight 

of her last new bonnet, which Miggs, as a means of calming her 

scattered spirits, displayed to the best advantage at her bedside.



'Here's master, mim,' said Miggs.  'Oh, what a happiness it is 

when man and wife come round again!  Oh gracious, to think that him 

and her should ever have a word together!'  In the energy of these 

sentiments, which were uttered as an apostrophe to the Heavens in 

general, Miss Miggs perched the bonnet on the top of her own head, 

and folding her hands, turned on her tears.



'I can't help it,' cried Miggs.  'I couldn't, if I was to be 

drownded in 'em.  She has such a forgiving spirit!  She'll forget 

all that has passed, and go along with you, sir--Oh, if it was to 

the world's end, she'd go along with you.'



Mrs Varden with a faint smile gently reproved her attendant for 

this enthusiasm, and reminded her at the same time that she was far 

too unwell to venture out that day.



'Oh no, you're not, mim, indeed you're not,' said Miggs; 'I repeal 

to master; master knows you're not, mim.  The hair, and motion of 

the shay, will do you good, mim, and you must not give way, you 

must not raly.  She must keep up, mustn't she, sir, for all out 

sakes?  I was a telling her that, just now.  She must remember us, 

even if she forgets herself.  Master will persuade you, mim, I'm 

sure.  There's Miss Dolly's a-going you know, and master, and you, 

and all so happy and so comfortable.  Oh!' cried Miggs, turning on 

the tears again, previous to quitting the room in great emotion, 'I 

never see such a blessed one as she is for the forgiveness of her 

spirit, I never, never, never did.  Not more did master neither; 

no, nor no one--never!'



For five minutes or thereabouts, Mrs Varden remained mildly opposed 

to all her husband's prayers that she would oblige him by taking a 

day's pleasure, but relenting at length, she suffered herself to be 

persuaded, and granting him her free forgiveness (the merit 

whereof, she meekly said, rested with the Manual and not with her), 

desired that Miggs might come and help her dress.  The handmaid 

attended promptly, and it is but justice to their joint exertions 

to record that, when the good lady came downstairs in course of 

time, completely decked out for the journey, she really looked as 

if nothing had happened, and appeared in the very best health 

imaginable.



As to Dolly, there she was again, the very pink and pattern of good 

looks, in a smart little cherry-coloured mantle, with a hood of 

the same drawn over her head, and upon the top of that hood, a 

little straw hat trimmed with cherry-coloured ribbons, and worn the 

merest trifle on one side--just enough in short to make it the 

wickedest and most provoking head-dress that ever malicious 

milliner devised.  And not to speak of the manner in which these 

cherry-coloured decorations brightened her eyes, or vied with her 

lips, or shed a new bloom on her face, she wore such a cruel little 

muff, and such a heart-rending pair of shoes, and was so 

surrounded and hemmed in, as it were, by aggravations of all kinds, 

that when Mr Tappettit, holding the horse's head, saw her come out 

of the house alone, such impulses came over him to decoy her into 

the chaise and drive off like mad, that he would unquestionably 

have done it, but for certain uneasy doubts besetting him as to the 

shortest way to Gretna Green; whether it was up the street or 

down, or up the right-hand turning or the left; and whether, 

supposing all the turnpikes to be carried by storm, the blacksmith 

in the end would marry them on credit; which by reason of his 

clerical office appeared, even to his excited imagination, so 

unlikely, that he hesitated.  And while he stood hesitating, and 

looking post-chaises-and-six at Dolly, out came his master and his 

mistress, and the constant Miggs, and the opportunity was gone for 

ever.  For now the chaise creaked upon its springs, and Mrs Varden 

was inside; and now it creaked again, and more than ever, and the 

locksmith was inside; and now it bounded once, as if its heart beat 

lightly, and Dolly was inside; and now it was gone and its place 

was empty, and he and that dreary Miggs were standing in the street 

together.



The hearty locksmith was in as good a humour as if nothing had 

occurred for the last twelve months to put him out of his way, 

Dolly was all smiles and graces, and Mrs Varden was agreeable 

beyond all precedent.  As they jogged through the streets talking 

of this thing and of that, who should be descried upon the pavement 

but that very coachmaker, looking so genteel that nobody would have 

believed he had ever had anything to do with a coach but riding in 

it, and bowing like any nobleman.  To be sure Dolly was confused 

when she bowed again, and to be sure the cherry-coloured ribbons 

trembled a little when she met his mournful eye, which seemed to 

say, 'I have kept my word, I have begun, the business is going to 

the devil, and you're the cause of it.'  There he stood, rooted to 

the ground: as Dolly said, like a statue; and as Mrs Varden said, 

like a pump; till they turned the corner: and when her father 

thought it was like his impudence, and her mother wondered what he 

meant by it, Dolly blushed again till her very hood was pale.



But on they went, not the less merrily for this, and there was the 

locksmith in the incautious fulness of his heart 'pulling-up' at 

all manner of places, and evincing a most intimate acquaintance 

with all the taverns on the road, and all the landlords and all the 

landladies, with whom, indeed, the little horse was on equally 

friendly terms, for he kept on stopping of his own accord.  Never 

were people so glad to see other people as these landlords and 

landladies were to behold Mr Varden and Mrs Varden and Miss Varden; 

and wouldn't they get out, said one; and they really must walk 

upstairs, said another; and she would take it ill and be quite 

certain they were proud if they wouldn't have a little taste of 

something, said a third; and so on, that it was really quite a 

Progress rather than a ride, and one continued scene of hospitality 

from beginning to end.  It was pleasant enough to be held in such 

esteem, not to mention the refreshments; so Mrs Varden said nothing 

at the time, and was all affability and delight--but such a body of 

evidence as she collected against the unfortunate locksmith that 

day, to be used thereafter as occasion might require, never was got 

together for matrimonial purposes.



In course of time--and in course of a pretty long time too, for 

these agreeable interruptions delayed them not a little,--they 

arrived upon the skirts of the Forest, and riding pleasantly on 

among the trees, came at last to the Maypole, where the locksmith's 

cheerful 'Yoho!' speedily brought to the porch old John, and after 

him young Joe, both of whom were so transfixed at sight of the 

ladies, that for a moment they were perfectly unable to give them 

any welcome, and could do nothing but stare.



It was only for a moment, however, that Joe forgot himself, for 

speedily reviving he thrust his drowsy father aside--to Mr Willet's 

mighty and inexpressible indignation--and darting out, stood ready 

to help them to alight.  It was necessary for Dolly to get out 

first.  Joe had her in his arms;--yes, though for a space of time 

no longer than you could count one in, Joe had her in his arms.  

Here was a glimpse of happiness!



It would be difficult to describe what a flat and commonplace 

affair the helping Mrs Varden out afterwards was, but Joe did it, 

and did it too with the best grace in the world.  Then old John, 

who, entertaining a dull and foggy sort of idea that Mrs Varden 

wasn't fond of him, had been in some doubt whether she might not 

have come for purposes of assault and battery, took courage, hoped 

she was well, and offered to conduct her into the house.  This 

tender being amicably received, they marched in together; Joe and 

Dolly followed, arm-in-arm, (happiness again!) and Varden brought 

up the rear.



Old John would have it that they must sit in the bar, and nobody 

objecting, into the bar they went.  All bars are snug places, but 

the Maypole's was the very snuggest, cosiest, and completest bar, 

that ever the wit of man devised.  Such amazing bottles in old 

oaken pigeon-holes; such gleaming tankards dangling from pegs at 

about the same inclination as thirsty men would hold them to their 

lips; such sturdy little Dutch kegs ranged in rows on shelves; so 

many lemons hanging in separate nets, and forming the fragrant 

grove already mentioned in this chronicle, suggestive, with goodly 

loaves of snowy sugar stowed away hard by, of punch, idealised 

beyond all mortal knowledge; such closets, such presses, such 

drawers full of pipes, such places for putting things away in 

hollow window-seats, all crammed to the throat with eatables, 

drinkables, or savoury condiments; lastly, and to crown all, as 

typical of the immense resources of the establishment, and its 

defiances to all visitors to cut and come again, such a stupendous 

cheese!



It is a poor heart that never rejoices--it must have been the 

poorest, weakest, and most watery heart that ever beat, which would 

not have warmed towards the Maypole bar.  Mrs Varden's did 

directly.  She could no more have reproached John Willet among 

those household gods, the kegs and bottles, lemons, pipes, and 

cheese, than she could have stabbed him with his own bright 

carving-knife.  The order for dinner too--it might have soothed a 

savage.  'A bit of fish,' said John to the cook, 'and some lamb 

chops (breaded, with plenty of ketchup), and a good salad, and a 

roast spring chicken, with a dish of sausages and mashed potatoes, 

or something of that sort.'  Something of that sort!  The resources 

of these inns!  To talk carelessly about dishes, which in 

themselves were a first-rate holiday kind of dinner, suitable to 

one's wedding-day, as something of that sort: meaning, if you can't 

get a spring chicken, any other trifle in the way of poultry will 

do--such as a peacock, perhaps!  The kitchen too, with its great 

broad cavernous chimney; the kitchen, where nothing in the way of 

cookery seemed impossible; where you could believe in anything to 

eat, they chose to tell you of.  Mrs Varden returned from the 

contemplation of these wonders to the bar again, with a head quite 

dizzy and bewildered.  Her housekeeping capacity was not large 

enough to comprehend them.  She was obliged to go to sleep.  Waking 

was pain, in the midst of such immensity.



Dolly in the meanwhile, whose gay heart and head ran upon other 

matters, passed out at the garden door, and glancing back now and 

then (but of course not wondering whether Joe saw her), tripped 

away by a path across the fields with which she was well 

acquainted, to discharge her mission at the Warren; and this 

deponent hath been informed and verily believes, that you might 

have seen many less pleasant objects than the cherry-coloured 

mantle and ribbons, as they went fluttering along the green meadows 

in the bright light of the day, like giddy things as they were.
