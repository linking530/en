Joe Willet rode leisurely along in his desponding mood, picturing 

the locksmith's daughter going down long country-dances, and 

poussetting dreadfully with bold strangers--which was almost too 

much to bear--when he heard the tramp of a horse's feet behind him, 

and looking back, saw a well-mounted gentleman advancing at a 

smart canter.  As this rider passed, he checked his steed, and 

called him of the Maypole by his name.  Joe set spurs to the grey 

mare, and was at his side directly.



'I thought it was you, sir,' he said, touching his hat.  'A fair 

evening, sir.  Glad to see you out of doors again.'



The gentleman smiled and nodded.  'What gay doings have been going 

on to-day, Joe?  Is she as pretty as ever?  Nay, don't blush, man.'



'If I coloured at all, Mr Edward,' said Joe, 'which I didn't know I 

did, it was to think I should have been such a fool as ever to have 

any hope of her.  She's as far out of my reach as--as Heaven is.'



'Well, Joe, I hope that's not altogether beyond it,' said Edward, 

good-humouredly.  'Eh?'



'Ah!' sighed Joe.  'It's all very fine talking, sir.  Proverbs are 

easily made in cold blood.  But it can't be helped.  Are you bound 

for our house, sir?'



'Yes.  As I am not quite strong yet, I shall stay there to-night, 

and ride home coolly in the morning.'



'If you're in no particular hurry,' said Joe after a short silence, 

'and will bear with the pace of this poor jade, I shall be glad to 

ride on with you to the Warren, sir, and hold your horse when you 

dismount.  It'll save you having to walk from the Maypole, there 

and back again.  I can spare the time well, sir, for I am too soon.'



'And so am I,' returned Edward, 'though I was unconsciously riding 

fast just now, in compliment I suppose to the pace of my thoughts, 

which were travelling post.  We will keep together, Joe, willingly, 

and be as good company as may be.  And cheer up, cheer up, think of 

the locksmith's daughter with a stout heart, and you shall win her 

yet.'



Joe shook his head; but there was something so cheery in the 

buoyant hopeful manner of this speech, that his spirits rose under 

its influence, and communicated as it would seem some new impulse 

even to the grey mare, who, breaking from her sober amble into a 

gentle trot, emulated the pace of Edward Chester's horse, and 

appeared to flatter herself that he was doing his very best.



It was a fine dry night, and the light of a young moon, which was 

then just rising, shed around that peace and tranquillity which 

gives to evening time its most delicious charm.  The lengthened 

shadows of the trees, softened as if reflected in still water, 

threw their carpet on the path the travellers pursued, and the 

light wind stirred yet more softly than before, as though it were 

soothing Nature in her sleep.  By little and little they ceased 

talking, and rode on side by side in a pleasant silence.



'The Maypole lights are brilliant to-night,' said Edward, as they 

rode along the lane from which, while the intervening trees were 

bare of leaves, that hostelry was visible.



'Brilliant indeed, sir,' returned Joe, rising in his stirrups to 

get a better view.  'Lights in the large room, and a fire 

glimmering in the best bedchamber?  Why, what company can this be 

for, I wonder!'



'Some benighted horseman wending towards London, and deterred from 

going on to-night by the marvellous tales of my friend the 

highwayman, I suppose,' said Edward.



'He must be a horseman of good quality to have such accommodations.  

Your bed too, sir--!'



'No matter, Joe.  Any other room will do for me.  But come--there's 

nine striking.  We may push on.'



They cantered forward at as brisk a pace as Joe's charger could 

attain, and presently stopped in the little copse where he had left 

her in the morning.  Edward dismounted, gave his bridle to his 

companion, and walked with a light step towards the house.



A female servant was waiting at a side gate in the garden-wall, and 

admitted him without delay.  He hurried along the terrace-walk, and 

darted up a flight of broad steps leading into an old and gloomy 

hall, whose walls were ornamented with rusty suits of armour, 

antlers, weapons of the chase, and suchlike garniture.  Here he 

paused, but not long; for as he looked round, as if expecting the 

attendant to have followed, and wondering she had not done so, a 

lovely girl appeared, whose dark hair next moment rested on his 

breast.  Almost at the same instant a heavy hand was laid upon her 

arm, Edward felt himself thrust away, and Mr Haredale stood between 

them.



He regarded the young man sternly without removing his hat; with 

one hand clasped his niece, and with the other, in which he held 

his riding-whip, motioned him towards the door.  The young man drew 

himself up, and returned his gaze.



'This is well done of you, sir, to corrupt my servants, and enter 

my house unbidden and in secret, like a thief!' said Mr Haredale.  

'Leave it, sir, and return no more.'



'Miss Haredale's presence,' returned the young man, 'and your 

relationship to her, give you a licence which, if you are a brave 

man, you will not abuse.  You have compelled me to this course, 

and the fault is yours--not mine.'



'It is neither generous, nor honourable, nor the act of a true 

man, sir,' retorted the other, 'to tamper with the affections of a 

weak, trusting girl, while you shrink, in your unworthiness, from 

her guardian and protector, and dare not meet the light of day.  

More than this I will not say to you, save that I forbid you this 

house, and require you to be gone.'



'It is neither generous, nor honourable, nor the act of a true man 

to play the spy,' said Edward.  'Your words imply dishonour, and I 

reject them with the scorn they merit.'



'You will find,' said Mr Haredale, calmly, 'your trusty go-between 

in waiting at the gate by which you entered.  I have played no 

spy's part, sir.  I chanced to see you pass the gate, and 

followed.  You might have heard me knocking for admission, had you 

been less swift of foot, or lingered in the garden.  Please to 

withdraw.  Your presence here is offensive to me and distressful to 

my niece.'  As he said these words, he passed his arm about the 

waist of the terrified and weeping girl, and drew her closer to 

him; and though the habitual severity of his manner was scarcely 

changed, there was yet apparent in the action an air of kindness 

and sympathy for her distress.



'Mr Haredale,' said Edward, 'your arm encircles her on whom I have 

set my every hope and thought, and to purchase one minute's 

happiness for whom I would gladly lay down my life; this house is 

the casket that holds the precious jewel of my existence.  Your 

niece has plighted her faith to me, and I have plighted mine to 

her.  What have I done that you should hold me in this light 

esteem, and give me these discourteous words?'



'You have done that, sir,' answered Mr Haredale, 'which must he 

undone.  You have tied a lover'-knot here which must be cut 

asunder.  Take good heed of what I say.  Must.  I cancel the bond 

between ye.  I reject you, and all of your kith and kin--all the 

false, hollow, heartless stock.'



'High words, sir,' said Edward, scornfully.



'Words of purpose and meaning, as you will find,' replied the 

other.  'Lay them to heart.'



'Lay you then, these,' said Edward.  'Your cold and sullen temper, 

which chills every breast about you, which turns affection into 

fear, and changes duty into dread, has forced us on this secret 

course, repugnant to our nature and our wish, and far more foreign, 

sir, to us than you.  I am not a false, a hollow, or a heartless 

man; the character is yours, who poorly venture on these injurious 

terms, against the truth, and under the shelter whereof I reminded 

you just now.  You shall not cancel the bond between us.  I will 

not abandon this pursuit.  I rely upon your niece's truth and 

honour, and set your influence at nought.  I leave her with a 

confidence in her pure faith, which you will never weaken, and with 

no concern but that I do not leave her in some gentler care.'



With that, he pressed her cold hand to his lips, and once more 

encountering and returning Mr Haredale's steady look, withdrew.



A few words to Joe as he mounted his horse sufficiently explained 

what had passed, and renewed all that young gentleman's despondency 

with tenfold aggravation.  They rode back to the Maypole without 

exchanging a syllable, and arrived at the door with heavy hearts.



Old John, who had peeped from behind the red curtain as they rode 

up shouting for Hugh, was out directly, and said with great 

importance as he held the young man's stirrup,



'He's comfortable in bed--the best bed.  A thorough gentleman; the 

smilingest, affablest gentleman I ever had to do with.'



'Who, Willet?' said Edward carelessly, as he dismounted.



'Your worthy father, sir,' replied John.  'Your honourable, 

venerable father.'



'What does he mean?' said Edward, looking with a mixture of alarm 

and doubt, at Joe.



'What DO you mean?' said Joe.  'Don't you see Mr Edward doesn't 

understand, father?'



'Why, didn't you know of it, sir?' said John, opening his eyes 

wide.  'How very singular!  Bless you, he's been here ever since 

noon to-day, and Mr Haredale has been having a long talk with him, 

and hasn't been gone an hour.'



'My father, Willet!'



'Yes, sir, he told me so--a handsome, slim, upright gentleman, in 

green-and-gold.  In your old room up yonder, sir.  No doubt you 

can go in, sir,' said John, walking backwards into the road and 

looking up at the window.  'He hasn't put out his candles yet, I 

see.'



Edward glanced at the window also, and hastily murmuring that he 

had changed his mind--forgotten something--and must return to 

London, mounted his horse again and rode away; leaving the Willets, 

father and son, looking at each other in mute astonishment.
