At noon next day, John Willet's guest sat lingering over his 

breakfast in his own home, surrounded by a variety of comforts, 

which left the Maypole's highest flight and utmost stretch of 

accommodation at an infinite distance behind, and suggested 

comparisons very much to the disadvantage and disfavour of that 

venerable tavern.



In the broad old-fashioned window-seat--as capacious as many modern 

sofas, and cushioned to serve the purpose of a luxurious settee--in 

the broad old-fashioned window-seat of a roomy chamber, Mr Chester 

lounged, very much at his ease, over a well-furnished breakfast-

table.  He had exchanged his riding-coat for a handsome morning-

gown, his boots for slippers; had been at great pains to atone for 

the having been obliged to make his toilet when he rose without the 

aid of dressing-case and tiring equipage; and, having gradually 

forgotten through these means the discomforts of an indifferent 

night and an early ride, was in a state of perfect complacency, 

indolence, and satisfaction.



The situation in which he found himself, indeed, was particularly 

favourable to the growth of these feelings; for, not to mention the 

lazy influence of a late and lonely breakfast, with the additional 

sedative of a newspaper, there was an air of repose about his place 

of residence peculiar to itself, and which hangs about it, even in 

these times, when it is more bustling and busy than it was in days 

of yore.



There are, still, worse places than the Temple, on a sultry day, 

for basking in the sun, or resting idly in the shade.  There is yet 

a drowsiness in its courts, and a dreamy dulness in its trees and 

gardens; those who pace its lanes and squares may yet hear the 

echoes of their footsteps on the sounding stones, and read upon its 

gates, in passing from the tumult of the Strand or Fleet Street, 

'Who enters here leaves noise behind.'  There is still the plash of 

falling water in fair Fountain Court, and there are yet nooks and 

corners where dun-haunted students may look down from their dusty 

garrets, on a vagrant ray of sunlight patching the shade of the 

tall houses, and seldom troubled to reflect a passing stranger's 

form.  There is yet, in the Temple, something of a clerkly monkish 

atmosphere, which public offices of law have not disturbed, and 

even legal firms have failed to scare away.  In summer time, its 

pumps suggest to thirsty idlers, springs cooler, and more 

sparkling, and deeper than other wells; and as they trace the 

spillings of full pitchers on the heated ground, they snuff the 

freshness, and, sighing, cast sad looks towards the Thames, and 

think of baths and boats, and saunter on, despondent.



It was in a room in Paper Buildings--a row of goodly tenements, 

shaded in front by ancient trees, and looking, at the back, upon 

the Temple Gardens--that this, our idler, lounged; now taking up 

again the paper he had laid down a hundred times; now trifling with 

the fragments of his meal; now pulling forth his golden toothpick, 

and glancing leisurely about the room, or out at window into the 

trim garden walks, where a few early loiterers were already pacing 

to and fro.  Here a pair of lovers met to quarrel and make up; 

there a dark-eyed nursery-maid had better eyes for Templars than 

her charge; on this hand an ancient spinster, with her lapdog in a 

string, regarded both enormities with scornful sidelong looks; on 

that a weazen old gentleman, ogling the nursery-maid, looked with 

like scorn upon the spinster, and wondered she didn't know she was 

no longer young.  Apart from all these, on the river's margin two 

or three couple of business-talkers walked slowly up and down in 

earnest conversation; and one young man sat thoughtfully on a 

bench, alone.



'Ned is amazingly patient!' said Mr Chester, glancing at this last-

named person as he set down his teacup and plied the golden 

toothpick, 'immensely patient!  He was sitting yonder when I began 

to dress, and has scarcely changed his posture since.  A most 

eccentric dog!'



As he spoke, the figure rose, and came towards him with a rapid 

pace.



'Really, as if he had heard me,' said the father, resuming his 

newspaper with a yawn.  'Dear Ned!'



Presently the room-door opened, and the young man entered; to whom 

his father gently waved his hand, and smiled.



'Are you at leisure for a little conversation, sir?' said Edward.



'Surely, Ned.  I am always at leisure.  You know my constitution.--

Have you breakfasted?'



'Three hours ago.'



'What a very early dog!' cried his father, contemplating him from 

behind the toothpick, with a languid smile.



'The truth is,' said Edward, bringing a chair forward, and seating 

himself near the table, 'that I slept but ill last night, and was 

glad to rise.  The cause of my uneasiness cannot but be known to 

you, sir; and it is upon that I wish to speak.'



'My dear boy,' returned his father, 'confide in me, I beg.  But you 

know my constitution--don't be prosy, Ned.'



'I will be plain, and brief,' said Edward.



'Don't say you will, my good fellow,' returned his father, crossing 

his legs, 'or you certainly will not.  You are going to tell me'--



'Plainly this, then,' said the son, with an air of great concern, 

'that I know where you were last night--from being on the spot, 

indeed--and whom you saw, and what your purpose was.'



'You don't say so!' cried his father.  'I am delighted to hear it.  

It saves us the worry, and terrible wear and tear of a long 

explanation, and is a great relief for both.  At the very house!  

Why didn't you come up?  I should have been charmed to see you.'



'I knew that what I had to say would be better said after a night's 

reflection, when both of us were cool,' returned the son.



''Fore Gad, Ned,' rejoined the father, 'I was cool enough last 

night.  That detestable Maypole!  By some infernal contrivance of 

the builder, it holds the wind, and keeps it fresh.  You remember 

the sharp east wind that blew so hard five weeks ago?  I give you 

my honour it was rampant in that old house last night, though out 

of doors there was a dead calm.  But you were saying'--



'I was about to say, Heaven knows how seriously and earnestly, that 

you have made me wretched, sir.  Will you hear me gravely for a 

moment?'



'My dear Ned,' said his father, 'I will hear you with the patience 

of an anchorite.  Oblige me with the milk.'



'I saw Miss Haredale last night,' Edward resumed, when he had 

complied with this request; 'her uncle, in her presence, 

immediately after your interview, and, as of course I know, in 

consequence of it, forbade me the house, and, with circumstances of 

indignity which are of your creation I am sure, commanded me to 

leave it on the instant.'



'For his manner of doing so, I give you my honour, Ned, I am not 

accountable,' said his father.  'That you must excuse.  He is a 

mere boor, a log, a brute, with no address in life.--Positively a 

fly in the jug.  The first I have seen this year.'



Edward rose, and paced the room.  His imperturbable parent sipped 

his tea.



'Father,' said the young man, stopping at length before him, 'we 

must not trifle in this matter.  We must not deceive each other, or 

ourselves.  Let me pursue the manly open part I wish to take, and 

do not repel me by this unkind indifference.'



'Whether I am indifferent or no,' returned the other, 'I leave you, 

my dear boy, to judge.  A ride of twenty-five or thirty miles, 

through miry roads--a Maypole dinner--a tete-a-tete with Haredale, 

which, vanity apart, was quite a Valentine and Orson business--a 

Maypole bed--a Maypole landlord, and a Maypole retinue of idiots 

and centaurs;--whether the voluntary endurance of these things 

looks like indifference, dear Ned, or like the excessive anxiety, 

and devotion, and all that sort of thing, of a parent, you shall 

determine for yourself.'



'I wish you to consider, sir,' said Edward, 'in what a cruel 

situation I am placed.  Loving Miss Haredale as I do'--



'My dear fellow,' interrupted his father with a compassionate 

smile, 'you do nothing of the kind.  You don't know anything about 

it.  There's no such thing, I assure you.  Now, do take my word for 

it.  You have good sense, Ned,--great good sense.  I wonder you 

should be guilty of such amazing absurdities.  You really surprise 

me.'



'I repeat,' said his son firmly, 'that I love her.  You have 

interposed to part us, and have, to the extent I have just now told 

you of, succeeded.  May I induce you, sir, in time, to think more 

favourably of our attachment, or is it your intention and your 

fixed design to hold us asunder if you can?'



'My dear Ned,' returned his father, taking a pinch of snuff and 

pushing his box towards him, 'that is my purpose most undoubtedly.'



'The time that has elapsed,' rejoined his son, 'since I began to 

know her worth, has flown in such a dream that until now I have 

hardly once paused to reflect upon my true position.  What is it?  

From my childhood I have been accustomed to luxury and idleness, 

and have been bred as though my fortune were large, and my 

expectations almost without a limit.  The idea of wealth has been 

familiarised to me from my cradle.  I have been taught to look upon 

those means, by which men raise themselves to riches and 

distinction, as being beyond my heeding, and beneath my care.  I 

have been, as the phrase is, liberally educated, and am fit for 

nothing.  I find myself at last wholly dependent upon you, with no 

resource but in your favour.  In this momentous question of my life 

we do not, and it would seem we never can, agree.  I have shrunk 

instinctively alike from those to whom you have urged me to pay 

court, and from the motives of interest and gain which have 

rendered them in your eyes visible objects for my suit.  If there 

never has been thus much plain-speaking between us before, sir, the 

fault has not been mine, indeed.  If I seem to speak too plainly 

now, it is, believe me father, in the hope that there may be a 

franker spirit, a worthier reliance, and a kinder confidence 

between us in time to come.'



'My good fellow,' said his smiling father, 'you quite affect me.  

Go on, my dear Edward, I beg.  But remember your promise.  There is 

great earnestness, vast candour, a manifest sincerity in all you 

say, but I fear I observe the faintest indications of a tendency to 

prose.'



'I am very sorry, sir.'



'I am very sorry, too, Ned, but you know that I cannot fix my mind 

for any long period upon one subject.  If you'll come to the point 

at once, I'll imagine all that ought to go before, and conclude it 

said.  Oblige me with the milk again.  Listening, invariably makes 

me feverish.'



'What I would say then, tends to this,' said Edward.  'I cannot 

bear this absolute dependence, sir, even upon you.  Time has been 

lost and opportunity thrown away, but I am yet a young man, and may 

retrieve it.  Will you give me the means of devoting such abilities 

and energies as I possess, to some worthy pursuit?  Will you let me 

try to make for myself an honourable path in life?  For any term 

you please to name--say for five years if you will--I will pledge 

myself to move no further in the matter of our difference without 

your fall concurrence.  During that period, I will endeavour 

earnestly and patiently, if ever man did, to open some prospect for 

myself, and free you from the burden you fear I should become if I 

married one whose worth and beauty are her chief endowments.  Will 

you do this, sir?  At the expiration of the term we agree upon, let 

us discuss this subject again.  Till then, unless it is revived by 

you, let it never be renewed between us.'



'My dear Ned,' returned his father, laying down the newspaper at 

which he had been glancing carelessly, and throwing himself back in 

the window-seat, 'I believe you know how very much I dislike what 

are called family affairs, which are only fit for plebeian 

Christmas days, and have no manner of business with people of our 

condition.  But as you are proceeding upon a mistake, Ned--

altogether upon a mistake--I will conquer my repugnance to entering 

on such matters, and give you a perfectly plain and candid answer, 

if you will do me the favour to shut the door.'



Edward having obeyed him, he took an elegant little knife from his 

pocket, and paring his nails, continued:



'You have to thank me, Ned, for being of good family; for your 

mother, charming person as she was, and almost broken-hearted, and 

so forth, as she left me, when she was prematurely compelled to 

become immortal--had nothing to boast of in that respect.'



'Her father was at least an eminent lawyer, sir,' said Edward.



'Quite right, Ned; perfectly so.  He stood high at the bar, had a 

great name and great wealth, but having risen from nothing--I have 

always closed my eyes to the circumstance and steadily resisted its 

contemplation, but I fear his father dealt in pork, and that his 

business did once involve cow-heel and sausages--he wished to marry 

his daughter into a good family.  He had his heart's desire, Ned.  

I was a younger son's younger son, and I married her.  We each had 

our object, and gained it.  She stepped at once into the politest 

and best circles, and I stepped into a fortune which I assure you 

was very necessary to my comfort--quite indispensable.  Now, my 

good fellow, that fortune is among the things that have been.  It 

is gone, Ned, and has been gone--how old are you?  I always 

forget.'



'Seven-and-twenty, sir.'



'Are you indeed?' cried his father, raising his eyelids in a 

languishing surprise.  'So much!  Then I should say, Ned, that as 

nearly as I remember, its skirts vanished from human knowledge, 

about eighteen or nineteen years ago.  It was about that time when 

I came to live in these chambers (once your grandfather's, and 

bequeathed by that extremely respectable person to me), and 

commenced to live upon an inconsiderable annuity and my past 

reputation.'



'You are jesting with me, sir,' said Edward.



'Not in the slightest degree, I assure you,' returned his father 

with great composure.  'These family topics are so extremely dry, 

that I am sorry to say they don't admit of any such relief.  It is 

for that reason, and because they have an appearance of business, 

that I dislike them so very much.  Well!  You know the rest.  A 

son, Ned, unless he is old enough to be a companion--that is to 

say, unless he is some two or three and twenty--is not the kind of 

thing to have about one.  He is a restraint upon his father, his 

father is a restraint upon him, and they make each other mutually 

uncomfortable.  Therefore, until within the last four years or so--

I have a poor memory for dates, and if I mistake, you will correct 

me in your own mind--you pursued your studies at a distance, and 

picked up a great variety of accomplishments.  Occasionally we 

passed a week or two together here, and disconcerted each other as 

only such near relations can.  At last you came home.  I candidly 

tell you, my dear boy, that if you had been awkward and overgrown, 

I should have exported you to some distant part of the world.'



'I wish with all my soul you had, sir,' said Edward.



'No you don't, Ned,' said his father coolly; 'you are mistaken, I 

assure you.  I found you a handsome, prepossessing, elegant 

fellow, and I threw you into the society I can still command.  

Having done that, my dear fellow, I consider that I have provided 

for you in life, and rely upon your doing something to provide for 

me in return.'



'I do not understand your meaning, sir.'



'My meaning, Ned, is obvious--I observe another fly in the cream-

jug, but have the goodness not to take it out as you did the first, 

for their walk when their legs are milky, is extremely ungraceful 

and disagreeable--my meaning is, that you must do as I did; that 

you must marry well and make the most of yourself.'



'A mere fortune-hunter!' cried the son, indignantly.



'What in the devil's name, Ned, would you be!' returned the father.  

'All men are fortune-hunters, are they not?  The law, the church, 

the court, the camp--see how they are all crowded with fortune-

hunters, jostling each other in the pursuit.  The stock-exchange, 

the pulpit, the counting-house, the royal drawing-room, the 

senate,--what but fortune-hunters are they filled with?  A fortune-

hunter!  Yes.  You ARE one; and you would be nothing else, my dear 

Ned, if you were the greatest courtier, lawyer, legislator, 

prelate, or merchant, in existence.  If you are squeamish and 

moral, Ned, console yourself with the reflection that at the very 

worst your fortune-hunting can make but one person miserable or 

unhappy.  How many people do you suppose these other kinds of 

huntsmen crush in following their sport--hundreds at a step?  Or 

thousands?'



The young man leant his head upon his hand, and made no answer.



'I am quite charmed,' said the father rising, and walking slowly to 

and fro--stopping now and then to glance at himself in the mirror, 

or survey a picture through his glass, with the air of a 

connoisseur, 'that we have had this conversation, Ned, unpromising 

as it was.  It establishes a confidence between us which is quite 

delightful, and was certainly necessary, though how you can ever 

have mistaken our positions and designs, I confess I cannot 

understand.  I conceived, until I found your fancy for this girl, 

that all these points were tacitly agreed upon between us.'



'I knew you were embarrassed, sir,' returned the son, raising his 

head for a moment, and then falling into his former attitude, 'but 

I had no idea we were the beggared wretches you describe.  How 

could I suppose it, bred as I have been; witnessing the life you 

have always led; and the appearance you have always made?'



'My dear child,' said the father--'for you really talk so like a 

child that I must call you one--you were bred upon a careful 

principle; the very manner of your education, I assure you, 

maintained my credit surprisingly.  As to the life I lead, I must 

lead it, Ned.  I must have these little refinements about me.  I 

have always been used to them, and I cannot exist without them.  

They must surround me, you observe, and therefore they are here.  

With regard to our circumstances, Ned, you may set your mind at 

rest upon that score.  They are desperate.  Your own appearance is 

by no means despicable, and our joint pocket-money alone devours 

our income.  That's the truth.'



'Why have I never known this before?  Why have you encouraged me, 

sir, to an expenditure and mode of life to which we have no right 

or title?'



'My good fellow,' returned his father more compassionately than 

ever, 'if you made no appearance, how could you possibly succeed in 

the pursuit for which I destined you?  As to our mode of life, 

every man has a right to live in the best way he can; and to make 

himself as comfortable as he can, or he is an unnatural scoundrel.  

Our debts, I grant, are very great, and therefore it the more 

behoves you, as a young man of principle and honour, to pay them 

off as speedily as possible.'



'The villain's part,' muttered Edward, 'that I have unconsciously 

played!  I to win the heart of Emma Haredale!  I would, for her 

sake, I had died first!'



'I am glad you see, Ned,' returned his father, 'how perfectly self-

evident it is, that nothing can be done in that quarter.  But apart 

from this, and the necessity of your speedily bestowing yourself 

on another (as you know you could to-morrow, if you chose), I wish 

you'd look upon it pleasantly.  In a religious point of view alone, 

how could you ever think of uniting yourself to a Catholic, unless 

she was amazingly rich?  You ought to be so very Protestant, 

coming of such a Protestant family as you do.  Let us be moral, 

Ned, or we are nothing.  Even if one could set that objection 

aside, which is impossible, we come to another which is quite 

conclusive.  The very idea of marrying a girl whose father was 

killed, like meat!  Good God, Ned, how disagreeable!  Consider the 

impossibility of having any respect for your father-in-law under 

such unpleasant circumstances--think of his having been "viewed" by 

jurors, and "sat upon" by coroners, and of his very doubtful 

position in the family ever afterwards.  It seems to me such an 

indelicate sort of thing that I really think the girl ought to have 

been put to death by the state to prevent its happening.  But I 

tease you perhaps.  You would rather be alone?  My dear Ned, most 

willingly.  God bless you.  I shall be going out presently, but we 

shall meet to-night, or if not to-night, certainly to-morrow.  

Take care of yourself in the mean time, for both our sakes.  You 

are a person of great consequence to me, Ned--of vast consequence 

indeed.  God bless you!'



With these words, the father, who had been arranging his cravat in 

the glass, while he uttered them in a disconnected careless manner, 

withdrew, humming a tune as he went.  The son, who had appeared so 

lost in thought as not to hear or understand them, remained quite 

still and silent.  After the lapse of half an hour or so, the elder 

Chester, gaily dressed, went out.  The younger still sat with his 

head resting on his hands, in what appeared to be a kind of stupor.
