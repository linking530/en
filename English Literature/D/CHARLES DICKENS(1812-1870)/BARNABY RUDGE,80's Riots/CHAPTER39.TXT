The applause which the performance of Hugh and his new friend 

elicited from the company at The Boot, had not yet subsided, and 

the two dancers were still panting from their exertions, which had 

been of a rather extreme and violent character, when the party was 

reinforced by the arrival of some more guests, who, being a 

detachment of United Bulldogs, were received with very flattering 

marks of distinction and respect.



The leader of this small party--for, including himself, they were 

but three in number--was our old acquaintance, Mr Tappertit, who 

seemed, physically speaking, to have grown smaller with years 

(particularly as to his legs, which were stupendously little), but 

who, in a moral point of view, in personal dignity and self-esteem, 

had swelled into a giant.  Nor was it by any means difficult for 

the most unobservant person to detect this state of feeling in the 

quondam 'prentice, for it not only proclaimed itself impressively 

and beyond mistake in his majestic walk and kindling eye, but found 

a striking means of revelation in his turned-up nose, which scouted 

all things of earth with deep disdain, and sought communion with 

its kindred skies.



Mr Tappertit, as chief or captain of the Bulldogs, was attended by 

his two lieutenants; one, the tall comrade of his younger life; the 

other, a 'Prentice Knight in days of yore--Mark Gilbert, bound in 

the olden time to Thomas Curzon of the Golden Fleece.  These 

gentlemen, like himself, were now emancipated from their 'prentice 

thraldom, and served as journeymen; but they were, in humble 

emulation of his great example, bold and daring spirits, and 

aspired to a distinguished state in great political events.  Hence 

their connection with the Protestant Association of England, 

sanctioned by the name of Lord George Gordon; and hence their 

present visit to The Boot.



'Gentlemen!' said Mr Tappertit, taking off his hat as a great 

general might in addressing his troops.  'Well met.  My lord does 

me and you the honour to send his compliments per self.'



'You've seen my lord too, have you?' said Dennis.  'I see him this 

afternoon.'



'My duty called me to the Lobby when our shop shut up; and I saw 

him there, sir,' Mr Tappertit replied, as he and his lieutenants 

took their seats.  'How do YOU do?'



'Lively, master, lively,' said the fellow.  'Here's a new brother, 

regularly put down in black and white by Muster Gashford; a credit 

to the cause; one of the stick-at-nothing sort; one arter my own 

heart.  D'ye see him?  Has he got the looks of a man that'll do, do 

you think?' he cried, as he slapped Hugh on the back.



'Looks or no looks,' said Hugh, with a drunken flourish of his arm, 

'I'm the man you want.  I hate the Papists, every one of 'em.  They 

hate me and I hate them.  They do me all the harm they can, and 

I'll do them all the harm I can.  Hurrah!'



'Was there ever,' said Dennis, looking round the room, when the 

echo of his boisterous voice bad died away; 'was there ever such a 

game boy!  Why, I mean to say, brothers, that if Muster Gashford 

had gone a hundred mile and got together fifty men of the common 

run, they wouldn't have been worth this one.'



The greater part of the company implicitly subscribed to this 

opinion, and testified their faith in Hugh by nods and looks of 

great significance.  Mr Tappertit sat and contemplated him for a 

long time in silence, as if he suspended his judgment; then drew a 

little nearer to him, and eyed him over more carefully; then went 

close up to him, and took him apart into a dark corner.



'I say,' he began, with a thoughtful brow, 'haven't I seen you 

before?'



'It's like you may,' said Hugh, in his careless way.  'I don't 

know; shouldn't wonder.'



'No, but it's very easily settled,' returned Sim.  'Look at me.  

Did you ever see ME before?  You wouldn't be likely to forget it, 

you know, if you ever did.  Look at me.  Don't be afraid; I won't 

do you any harm.  Take a good look--steady now.'



The encouraging way in which Mr Tappertit made this request, and 

coupled it with an assurance that he needn't be frightened, amused 

Hugh mightily--so much indeed, that be saw nothing at all of the 

small man before him, through closing his eyes in a fit of hearty 

laughter, which shook his great broad sides until they ached again.



'Come!' said Mr Tappertit, growing a little impatient under this 

disrespectful treatment.  'Do you know me, feller?'



'Not I,' cried Hugh.  'Ha ha ha!  Not I!  But I should like to.'



'And yet I'd have wagered a seven-shilling piece," said Mr 

Tappertit, folding his arms, and confronting him with his legs wide 

apart and firmly planted on the ground, 'that you once were hostler 

at the Maypole.'



Hugh opened his eyes on hearing this, and looked at him in great 

surprise.



'--And so you were, too,' said Mr Tappertit, pushing him away with 

a condescending playfulness.  'When did MY eyes ever deceive--

unless it was a young woman!  Don't you know me now?'



'Why it an't--' Hugh faltered.



'An't it?' said Mr Tappertit.  'Are you sure of that?  You remember 

G. Varden, don't you?'



Certainly Hugh did, and he remembered D. Varden too; but that he 

didn't tell him.



'You remember coming down there, before I was out of my time, to 

ask after a vagabond that had bolted off, and left his disconsolate 

father a prey to the bitterest emotions, and all the rest of it--

don't you?' said Mr Tappertit.



'Of course I do!' cried Hugh.  'And I saw you there.'



'Saw me there!' said Mr Tappertit.  'Yes, I should think you did 

see me there.  The place would be troubled to go on without me.  

Don't you remember my thinking you liked the vagabond, and on that 

account going to quarrel with you; and then finding you detested 

him worse than poison, going to drink with you?  Don't you remember 

that?'



'To be sure!' cried Hugh.



'Well! and are you in the same mind now?' said Mr Tappertit.



'Yes!' roared Hugh.



'You speak like a man,' said Mr Tappertit, 'and I'll shake hands 

with you.'  With these conciliatory expressions he suited the 

action to the word; and Hugh meeting his advances readily, they 

performed the ceremony with a show of great heartiness.



'I find,' said Mr Tappertit, looking round on the assembled guests, 

'that brother What's-his-name and I are old acquaintance.--You 

never heard anything more of that rascal, I suppose, eh?'



'Not a syllable,' replied Hugh.  'I never want to.  I don't believe 

I ever shall.  He's dead long ago, I hope.'



'It's to be hoped, for the sake of mankind in general and the 

happiness of society, that he is,' said Mr Tappertit, rubbing his 

palm upon his legs, and looking at it between whiles.  'Is your 

other hand at all cleaner?  Much the same.  Well, I'll owe you 

another shake.  We'll suppose it done, if you've no objection.'



Hugh laughed again, and with such thorough abandonment to his mad 

humour, that his limbs seemed dislocated, and his whole frame in 

danger of tumbling to pieces; but Mr Tappertit, so far from 

receiving this extreme merriment with any irritation, was pleased 

to regard it with the utmost favour, and even to join in it, so far 

as one of his gravity and station could, with any regard to that 

decency and decorum which men in high places are expected to 

maintain.



Mr Tappertit did not stop here, as many public characters might 

have done, but calling up his brace of lieutenants, introduced Hugh 

to them with high commendation; declaring him to be a man who, at 

such times as those in which they lived, could not be too much 

cherished.  Further, he did him the honour to remark, that he would 

be an acquisition of which even the United Bulldogs might be proud; 

and finding, upon sounding him, that he was quite ready and willing 

to enter the society (for he was not at all particular, and would 

have leagued himself that night with anything, or anybody, for any 

purpose whatsoever), caused the necessary preliminaries to be gone 

into upon the spot.  This tribute to his great merit delighted no 

man more than Mr Dennis, as he himself proclaimed with several rare 

and surprising oaths; and indeed it gave unmingled satisfaction to 

the whole assembly.



'Make anything you like of me!' cried Hugh, flourishing the can he 

had emptied more than once.  'Put me on any duty you please.  I'm 

your man.  I'll do it.  Here's my captain--here's my leader.  Ha ha 

ha!  Let him give me the word of command, and I'll fight the whole 

Parliament House single-handed, or set a lighted torch to the 

King's Throne itself!'  With that, he smote Mr Tappertit on the 

back, with such violence that his little body seemed to shrink into 

a mere nothing; and roared again until the very foundlings near at 

hand were startled in their beds.



In fact, a sense of something whimsical in their companionship 

seemed to have taken entire possession of his rude brain.  The bare 

fact of being patronised by a great man whom he could have crushed 

with one hand, appeared in his eyes so eccentric and humorous, that 

a kind of ferocious merriment gained the mastery over him, and 

quite subdued his brutal nature.  He roared and roared again; 

toasted Mr Tappertit a hundred times; declared himself a Bulldog to 

the core; and vowed to be faithful to him to the last drop of blood 

in his veins.



All these compliments Mr Tappertit received as matters of course--

flattering enough in their way, but entirely attributable to his 

vast superiority.  His dignified self-possession only delighted 

Hugh the more; and in a word, this giant and dwarf struck up a 

friendship which bade fair to be of long continuance, as the one 

held it to be his right to command, and the other considered it an 

exquisite pleasantry to obey.  Nor was Hugh by any means a passive 

follower, who scrupled to act without precise and definite orders; 

for when Mr Tappertit mounted on an empty cask which stood by way 

of rostrum in the room, and volunteered a speech upon the alarming 

crisis then at hand, he placed himself beside the orator, and 

though he grinned from ear to ear at every word he said, threw out 

such expressive hints to scoffers in the management of his cudgel, 

that those who were at first the most disposed to interrupt, became 

remarkably attentive, and were the loudest in their approbation.



It was not all noise and jest, however, at The Boot, nor were the 

whole party listeners to the speech.  There were some men at the 

other end of the room (which was a long, low-roofed chamber) in 

earnest conversation all the time; and when any of this group went 

out, fresh people were sure to come in soon afterwards and sit down 

in their places, as though the others had relieved them on some 

watch or duty; which it was pretty clear they did, for these 

changes took place by the clock, at intervals of half an hour.  

These persons whispered very much among themselves, and kept aloof, 

and often looked round, as jealous of their speech being overheard; 

some two or three among them entered in books what seemed to be 

reports from the others; when they were not thus employed) one of 

them would turn to the newspapers which were strewn upon the table, 

and from the St James's Chronicle, the Herald, Chronicle, or 

Public Advertiser, would read to the rest in a low voice some 

passage having reference to the topic in which they were all so 

deeply interested.  But the great attraction was a pamphlet called 

The Thunderer, which espoused their own opinions, and was supposed 

at that time to emanate directly from the Association.  This was 

always in request; and whether read aloud, to an eager knot of 

listeners, or by some solitary man, was certain to be followed by 

stormy talking and excited looks.



In the midst of all his merriment, and admiration of his captain, 

Hugh was made sensible by these and other tokens, of the presence 

of an air of mystery, akin to that which had so much impressed him 

out of doors.  It was impossible to discard a sense that something 

serious was going on, and that under the noisy revel of the public-

house, there lurked unseen and dangerous matter.  Little affected 

by this, however, he was perfectly satisfied with his quarters and 

would have remained there till morning, but that his conductor rose 

soon after midnight, to go home; Mr Tappertit following his 

example, left him no excuse to stay.  So they all three left the 

house together: roaring a No-Popery song until the fields 

resounded with the dismal noise.



Cheer up, captain!' cried Hugh, when they had roared themselves out 

of breath.  'Another stave!'



Mr Tappertit, nothing loath, began again; and so the three went 

staggering on, arm-in-arm, shouting like madmen, and defying the 

watch with great valour.  Indeed this did not require any unusual 

bravery or boldness, as the watchmen of that time, being selected 

for the office on account of excessive age and extraordinary 

infirmity, had a custom of shutting themselves up tight in their 

boxes on the first symptoms of disturbance, and remaining there 

until they disappeared.  In these proceedings, Mr Dennis, who had a 

gruff voice and lungs of considerable power, distinguished himself 

very much, and acquired great credit with his two companions.



'What a queer fellow you are!' said Mr Tappertit.  'You're so 

precious sly and close.  Why don't you ever tell what trade you're 

of?'



'Answer the captain instantly,' cried Hugh, beating his hat down on 

his head; 'why don't you ever tell what trade you're of?'



'I'm of as gen-teel a calling, brother, as any man in England--as 

light a business as any gentleman could desire.'



'Was you 'prenticed to it?' asked Mr Tappertit.



'No.  Natural genius,' said Mr Dennis.  'No 'prenticing.  It come 

by natur'.  Muster Gashford knows my calling.  Look at that hand of 

mine--many and many a job that hand has done, with a neatness and 

dex-terity, never known afore.  When I look at that hand,' said Mr 

Dennis, shaking it in the air, 'and remember the helegant bits of 

work it has turned off, I feel quite molloncholy to think it should 

ever grow old and feeble.  But sich is life!'



He heaved a deep sigh as he indulged in these reflections, and 

putting his fingers with an absent air on Hugh's throat, and 

particularly under his left ear, as if he were studying the 

anatomical development of that part of his frame, shook his head in 

a despondent manner and actually shed tears.



'You're a kind of artist, I suppose--eh!' said Mr Tappertit.



'Yes,' rejoined Dennis; 'yes--I may call myself a artist--a fancy 

workman--art improves natur'--that's my motto.'



'And what do you call this?' said Mr Tappertit taking his stick out 

of his hand.



'That's my portrait atop,' Dennis replied; 'd'ye think it's like?'



'Why--it's a little too handsome,' said Mr Tappertit.  'Who did it?  

You?'



'I!' repeated Dennis, gazing fondly on his image.  'I wish I had 

the talent.  That was carved by a friend of mine, as is now no 

more.  The very day afore he died, he cut that with his pocket-

knife from memory!  "I'll die game," says my friend, "and my last 

moments shall be dewoted to making Dennis's picter."  That's it.'



'That was a queer fancy, wasn't it?' said Mr Tappertit.



'It WAS a queer fancy,' rejoined the other, breathing on his 

fictitious nose, and polishing it with the cuff of his coat, 'but 

he was a queer subject altogether--a kind of gipsy--one of the 

finest, stand-up men, you ever see.  Ah!  He told me some things 

that would startle you a bit, did that friend of mine, on the 

morning when he died.'



'You were with him at the time, were you?' said Mr Tappertit.



'Yes,' he answered with a curious look, 'I was there.  Oh! yes 

certainly, I was there.  He wouldn't have gone off half as 

comfortable without me.  I had been with three or four of his 

family under the same circumstances.  They were all fine fellows.'



'They must have been fond of you,' remarked Mr Tappertit, looking 

at him sideways.



'I don't know that they was exactly fond of me,' said Dennis, with 

a little hesitation, 'but they all had me near 'em when they 

departed.  I come in for their wardrobes too.  This very handkecher 

that you see round my neck, belonged to him that I've been speaking 

of--him as did that likeness.'



Mr Tappertit glanced at the article referred to, and appeared to 

think that the deceased's ideas of dress were of a peculiar and by 

no means an expensive kind.  He made no remark upon the point, 

however, and suffered his mysterious companion to proceed without 

interruption.



'These smalls,' said Dennis, rubbing his legs; 'these very smalls--

they belonged to a friend of mine that's left off sich incumbrances 

for ever: this coat too--I've often walked behind this coat, in the 

street, and wondered whether it would ever come to me: this pair of 

shoes have danced a hornpipe for another man, afore my eyes, full 

half-a-dozen times at least: and as to my hat,' he said, taking it 

off, and whirling it round upon his fist--'Lord! I've seen this hat 

go up Holborn on the box of a hackney-coach--ah, many and many a 

day!'



'You don't mean to say their old wearers are ALL dead, I hope?' 

said Mr Tappertit, falling a little distance from him as he spoke.



'Every one of 'em,' replied Dennis.  'Every man Jack!'



There was something so very ghastly in this circumstance, and it 

appeared to account, in such a very strange and dismal manner, for 

his faded dress--which, in this new aspect, seemed discoloured by 

the earth from graves--that Mr Tappertit abruptly found he was 

going another way, and, stopping short, bade him good night with 

the utmost heartiness.  As they happened to be near the Old Bailey, 

and Mr Dennis knew there were turnkeys in the lodge with whom he 

could pass the night, and discuss professional subjects of common 

interest among them before a rousing fire, and over a social glass, 

he separated from his companions without any great regret, and 

warmly shaking hands with Hugh, and making an early appointment for 

their meeting at The Boot, left them to pursue their road.



'That's a strange sort of man,' said Mr Tappertit, watching the 

hackney-coachman's hat as it went bobbing down the street.  'I 

don't know what to make of him.  Why can't he have his smalls made 

to order, or wear live clothes at any rate?'



'He's a lucky man, captain,' cried Hugh.  'I should like to have 

such friends as his.'



'I hope he don't get 'em to make their wills, and then knock 'em on 

the head,' said Mr Tappertit, musing.  'But come.  The United B.'s 

expect me.  On!--What's the matter?'



'I quite forgot,' said Hugh, who had started at the striking of a 

neighbouring clock.  'I have somebody to see to-night--I must turn 

back directly.  The drinking and singing put it out of my head.  

It's well I remembered it!'



Mr Tappertit looked at him as though he were about to give 

utterance to some very majestic sentiments in reference to this act 

of desertion, but as it was clear, from Hugh's hasty manner, that 

the engagement was one of a pressing nature, he graciously forbore, 

and gave him his permission to depart immediately, which Hugh 

acknowledged with a roar of laughter.



'Good night, captain!' he cried.  'I am yours to the death, 

remember!'



'Farewell!' said Mr Tappertit, waving his hand.  'Be bold and 

vigilant!'



'No Popery, captain!' roared Hugh.



'England in blood first!' cried his desperate leader.  Whereat Hugh 

cheered and laughed, and ran off like a greyhound.



'That man will prove a credit to my corps,' said Simon, turning 

thoughtfully upon his heel.  'And let me see.  In an altered state 

of society--which must ensue if we break out and are victorious--

when the locksmith's child is mine, Miggs must be got rid of 

somehow, or she'll poison the tea-kettle one evening when I'm out.  

He might marry Miggs, if he was drunk enough.  It shall be done.  

I'll make a note of it.'
