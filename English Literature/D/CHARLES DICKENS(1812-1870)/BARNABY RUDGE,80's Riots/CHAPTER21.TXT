It was for the moment an inexpressible relief to Dolly, to 

recognise in the person who forced himself into the path so 

abruptly, and now stood directly in her way, Hugh of the Maypole, 

whose name she uttered in a tone of delighted surprise that came 

from her heart.



'Was it you?' she said, 'how glad I am to see you! and how could 

you terrify me so!'



In answer to which, he said nothing at all, but stood quite still, 

looking at her.



'Did you come to meet me?' asked Dolly.



Hugh nodded, and muttered something to the effect that he had been 

waiting for her, and had expected her sooner.



'I thought it likely they would send,' said Dolly, greatly 

reassured by this.



'Nobody sent me,' was his sullen answer.  'I came of my own 

accord.'



The rough bearing of this fellow, and his wild, uncouth appearance, 

had often filled the girl with a vague apprehension even when other 

people were by, and had occasioned her to shrink from him 

involuntarily.  The having him for an unbidden companion in so 

solitary a place, with the darkness fast gathering about them, 

renewed and even increased the alarm she had felt at first.



If his manner had been merely dogged and passively fierce, as 

usual, she would have had no greater dislike to his company than 

she always felt--perhaps, indeed, would have been rather glad to 

have had him at hand.  But there was something of coarse bold 

admiration in his look, which terrified her very much.  She glanced 

timidly towards him, uncertain whether to go forward or retreat, 

and he stood gazing at her like a handsome satyr; and so they 

remained for some short time without stirring or breaking silence.  

At length Dolly took courage, shot past him, and hurried on.



'Why do you spend so much breath in avoiding me?' said Hugh, 

accommodating his pace to hers, and keeping close at her side.



'I wish to get back as quickly as I can, and you walk too near me, 

answered Dolly.'



'Too near!' said Hugh, stooping over her so that she could feel his 

breath upon her forehead.  'Why too near?  You're always proud to 

ME, mistress.'



'I am proud to no one.  You mistake me,' answered Dolly.  'Fall 

back, if you please, or go on.'



'Nay, mistress,' he rejoined, endeavouring to draw her arm through 

his, 'I'll walk with you.'



She released herself and clenching her little hand, struck him with 

right good will.  At this, Maypole Hugh burst into a roar of 

laughter, and passing his arm about her waist, held her in his 

strong grasp as easily as if she had been a bird.



'Ha ha ha!  Well done, mistress!  Strike again.  You shall beat my 

face, and tear my hair, and pluck my beard up by the roots, and 

welcome, for the sake of your bright eyes.  Strike again, mistress.  

Do.  Ha ha ha!  I like it.'



'Let me go,' she cried, endeavouring with both her hands to push 

him off.  'Let me go this moment.'



'You had as good be kinder to me, Sweetlips,' said Hugh.  'You had, 

indeed.  Come.  Tell me now.  Why are you always so proud?  I 

don't quarrel with you for it.  I love you when you're proud.  Ha 

ha ha!  You can't hide your beauty from a poor fellow; that's a 

comfort!'



She gave him no answer, but as he had not yet checked her progress, 

continued to press forward as rapidly as she could.  At length, 

between the hurry she had made, her terror, and the tightness of 

his embrace, her strength failed her, and she could go no further.



'Hugh,' cried the panting girl, 'good Hugh; if you will leave me I 

will give you anything--everything I have--and never tell one word 

of this to any living creature.'



'You had best not,' he answered.  'Harkye, little dove, you had 

best not.  All about here know me, and what I dare do if I have a 

mind.  If ever you are going to tell, stop when the words are on 

your lips, and think of the mischief you'll bring, if you do, upon 

some innocent heads that you wouldn't wish to hurt a hair of.  

Bring trouble on me, and I'll bring trouble and something more on 

them in return.  I care no more for them than for so many dogs; not 

so much--why should I?  I'd sooner kill a man than a dog any day.  

I've never been sorry for a man's death in all my life, and I have 

for a dog's.'



There was something so thoroughly savage in the manner of these 

expressions, and the looks and gestures by which they were 

accompanied, that her great fear of him gave her new strength, and 

enabled her by a sudden effort to extricate herself and run fleetly 

from him.  But Hugh was as nimble, strong, and swift of foot, as 

any man in broad England, and it was but a fruitless expenditure of 

energy, for he had her in his encircling arms again before she had 

gone a hundred yards.



'Softly, darling--gently--would you fly from rough Hugh, that loves 

you as well as any drawing-room gallant?'



'I would,' she answered, struggling to free herself again.  'I 

will.  Help!'



'A fine for crying out,' said Hugh.  'Ha ha ha!  A fine, pretty 

one, from your lips.  I pay myself!  Ha ha ha!'



'Help! help! help!'  As she shrieked with the utmost violence she 

could exert, a shout was heard in answer, and another, and another.



'Thank Heaven!' cried the girl in an ecstasy.  'Joe, dear Joe, this 

way.  Help!'



Her assailant paused, and stood irresolute for a moment, but the 

shouts drawing nearer and coming quick upon them, forced him to a 

speedy decision.  He released her, whispered with a menacing look, 

'Tell HIM: and see what follows!' and leaping the hedge, was gone 

in an instant.  Dolly darted off, and fairly ran into Joe Willet's 

open arms.



'What is the matter? are you hurt? what was it? who was it? where 

is he? what was he like?' with a great many encouraging expressions 

and assurances of safety, were the first words Joe poured forth.  

But poor little Dolly was so breathless and terrified that for some 

time she was quite unable to answer him, and hung upon his 

shoulder, sobbing and crying as if her heart would break.



Joe had not the smallest objection to have her hanging on his 

shoulder; no, not the least, though it crushed the cherry-coloured 

ribbons sadly, and put the smart little hat out of all shape.  But 

he couldn't bear to see her cry; it went to his very heart.  He 

tried to console her, bent over her, whispered to her--some say 

kissed her, but that's a fable.  At any rate he said all the kind 

and tender things he could think of and Dolly let him go on and 

didn't interrupt him once, and it was a good ten minutes before she 

was able to raise her head and thank him.



'What was it that frightened you?' said Joe.



A man whose person was unknown to her had followed her, she 

answered; he began by begging, and went on to threats of robbery, 

which he was on the point of carrying into execution, and would 

have executed, but for Joe's timely aid.  The hesitation and 

confusion with which she said this, Joe attributed to the fright 

she had sustained, and no suspicion of the truth occurred to him 

for a moment.



'Stop when the words are on your lips.'  A hundred times that 

night, and very often afterwards, when the disclosure was rising 

to her tongue, Dolly thought of that, and repressed it.  A deeply 

rooted dread of the man; the conviction that his ferocious nature, 

once roused, would stop at nothing; and the strong assurance that 

if she impeached him, the full measure of his wrath and vengeance 

would be wreaked on Joe, who had preserved her; these were 

considerations she had not the courage to overcome, and inducements 

to secrecy too powerful for her to surmount.



Joe, for his part, was a great deal too happy to inquire very 

curiously into the matter; and Dolly being yet too tremulous to 

walk without assistance, they went forward very slowly, and in his 

mind very pleasantly, until the Maypole lights were near at hand, 

twinkling their cheerful welcome, when Dolly stopped suddenly and 

with a half scream exclaimed,



'The letter!'



'What letter?' cried Joe.



'That I was carrying--I had it in my hand.  My bracelet too,' she 

said, clasping her wrist.  'I have lost them both.'



'Do you mean just now?' said Joe.



'Either I dropped them then, or they were taken from me,' answered 

Dolly, vainly searching her pocket and rustling her dress.  'They 

are gone, both gone.  What an unhappy girl I am!'  With these words 

poor Dolly, who to do her justice was quite as sorry for the loss 

of the letter as for her bracelet, fell a-crying again, and 

bemoaned her fate most movingly.



Joe tried to comfort her with the assurance that directly he had 

housed her in the Maypole, he would return to the spot with a 

lantern (for it was now quite dark) and make strict search for the 

missing articles, which there was great probability of his finding, 

as it was not likely that anybody had passed that way since, and 

she was not conscious that they had been forcibly taken from her.  

Dolly thanked him very heartily for this offer, though with no 

great hope of his quest being successful; and so with many 

lamentations on her side, and many hopeful words on his, and much 

weakness on the part of Dolly and much tender supporting on the 

part of Joe, they reached the Maypole bar at last, where the 

locksmith and his wife and old John were yet keeping high festival.



Mr Willet received the intelligence of Dolly's trouble with that 

surprising presence of mind and readiness of speech for which he 

was so eminently distinguished above all other men.  Mrs Varden 

expressed her sympathy for her daughter's distress by scolding her 

roundly for being so late; and the honest locksmith divided himself 

between condoling with and kissing Dolly, and shaking hands 

heartily with Joe, whom he could not sufficiently praise or thank.



In reference to this latter point, old John was far from agreeing 

with his friend; for besides that he by no means approved of an 

adventurous spirit in the abstract, it occurred to him that if his 

son and heir had been seriously damaged in a scuffle, the 

consequences would assuredly have been expensive and inconvenient, 

and might perhaps have proved detrimental to the Maypole business.  

Wherefore, and because he looked with no favourable eye upon young 

girls, but rather considered that they and the whole female sex 

were a kind of nonsensical mistake on the part of Nature, he took 

occasion to retire and shake his head in private at the boiler; 

inspired by which silent oracle, he was moved to give Joe various 

stealthy nudges with his elbow, as a parental reproof and gentle 

admonition to mind his own business and not make a fool of himself.



Joe, however, took down the lantern and lighted it; and arming 

himself with a stout stick, asked whether Hugh was in the stable.



'He's lying asleep before the kitchen fire, sir,' said Mr Willet.  

'What do you want him for?'



'I want him to come with me to look after this bracelet and 

letter,' answered Joe.  'Halloa there!  Hugh!'



Dolly turned pale as death, and felt as if she must faint 

forthwith.  After a few moments, Hugh came staggering in, 

stretching himself and yawning according to custom, and presenting 

every appearance of having been roused from a sound nap.



'Here, sleepy-head,' said Joe, giving him the lantern.  'Carry 

this, and bring the dog, and that small cudgel of yours.  And woe 

betide the fellow if we come upon him.'



'What fellow?' growled Hugh, rubbing his eyes and shaking himself.



'What fellow?' returned Joe, who was in a state of great valour and 

bustle; 'a fellow you ought to know of and be more alive about.  

It's well for the like of you, lazy giant that you are, to be 

snoring your time away in chimney-corners, when honest men's 

daughters can't cross even our quiet meadows at nightfall without 

being set upon by footpads, and frightened out of their precious 

lives.'



'They never rob me,' cried Hugh with a laugh.  'I have got nothing 

to lose.  But I'd as lief knock them at head as any other men.  How 

many are there?'



'Only one,' said Dolly faintly, for everybody looked at her.



'And what was he like, mistress?' said Hugh with a glance at young 

Willet, so slight and momentary that the scowl it conveyed was lost 

on all but her.  'About my height?'



'Not--not so tall,' Dolly replied, scarce knowing what she said.



'His dress,' said Hugh, looking at her keenly, 'like--like any of 

ours now?  I know all the people hereabouts, and maybe could give a 

guess at the man, if I had anything to guide me.'



Dolly faltered and turned paler yet; then answered that he was 

wrapped in a loose coat and had his face hidden by a handkerchief 

and that she could give no other description of him.



'You wouldn't know him if you saw him then, belike?' said Hugh with 

a malicious grin.



'I should not,' answered Dolly, bursting into tears again.  'I 

don't wish to see him.  I can't bear to think of him.  I can't talk 

about him any more.  Don't go to look for these things, Mr Joe, 

pray don't.  I entreat you not to go with that man.'



'Not to go with me!' cried Hugh.  'I'm too rough for them all.  

They're all afraid of me.  Why, bless you mistress, I've the 

tenderest heart alive.  I love all the ladies, ma'am,' said Hugh, 

turning to the locksmith's wife.



Mrs Varden opined that if he did, he ought to be ashamed of 

himself; such sentiments being more consistent (so she argued) with 

a benighted Mussulman or wild Islander than with a stanch 

Protestant.  Arguing from this imperfect state of his morals, Mrs 

Varden further opined that he had never studied the Manual.  Hugh 

admitting that he never had, and moreover that he couldn't read, 

Mrs Varden declared with much severity, that he ought to he even 

more ashamed of himself than before, and strongly recommended him 

to save up his pocket-money for the purchase of one, and further to 

teach himself the contents with all convenient diligence.  She was 

still pursuing this train of discourse, when Hugh, somewhat 

unceremoniously and irreverently, followed his young master out, 

and left her to edify the rest of the company.  This she proceeded 

to do, and finding that Mr Willet's eyes were fixed upon her with 

an appearance of deep attention, gradually addressed the whole of 

her discourse to him, whom she entertained with a moral and 

theological lecture of considerable length, in the conviction that 

great workings were taking place in his spirit.  The simple truth 

was, however, that Mr Willet, although his eyes were wide open and 

he saw a woman before him whose head by long and steady looking at 

seemed to grow bigger and bigger until it filled the whole bar, was 

to all other intents and purposes fast asleep; and so sat leaning 

back in his chair with his hands in his pockets until his son's 

return caused him to wake up with a deep sigh, and a faint 

impression that he had been dreaming about pickled pork and greens--

a vision of his slumbers which was no doubt referable to the 

circumstance of Mrs Varden's having frequently pronounced the word 

'Grace' with much emphasis; which word, entering the portals of Mr 

Willet's brain as they stood ajar, and coupling itself with the 

words 'before meat,' which were there ranging about, did in time 

suggest a particular kind of meat together with that description of 

vegetable which is usually its companion.



The search was wholly unsuccessful.  Joe had groped along the path 

a dozen times, and among the grass, and in the dry ditch, and in 

the hedge, but all in vain.  Dolly, who was quite inconsolable for 

her loss, wrote a note to Miss Haredale giving her the same account 

of it that she had given at the Maypole, which Joe undertook to 

deliver as soon as the family were stirring next day.  That done, 

they sat down to tea in the bar, where there was an uncommon 

display of buttered toast, and--in order that they might not grow 

faint for want of sustenance, and might have a decent halting-

place or halfway house between dinner and supper--a few savoury 

trifles in the shape of great rashers of broiled ham, which being 

well cured, done to a turn, and smoking hot, sent forth a tempting 

and delicious fragrance.



Mrs Varden was seldom very Protestant at meals, unless it happened 

that they were underdone, or overdone, or indeed that anything 

occurred to put her out of humour.  Her spirits rose considerably 

on beholding these goodly preparations, and from the nothingness of 

good works, she passed to the somethingness of ham and toast with 

great cheerfulness.  Nay, under the influence of these wholesome 

stimulants, she sharply reproved her daughter for being low and 

despondent (which she considered an unacceptable frame of mind), 

and remarked, as she held her own plate for a fresh supply, that it 

would be well for Dolly, who pined over the loss of a toy and a 

sheet of paper, if she would reflect upon the voluntary sacrifices 

of the missionaries in foreign parts who lived chiefly on salads.



The proceedings of such a day occasion various fluctuations in the 

human thermometer, and especially in instruments so sensitively and 

delicately constructed as Mrs Varden.  Thus, at dinner Mrs V. stood 

at summer heat; genial, smiling, and delightful.  After dinner, in 

the sunshine of the wine, she went up at least half-a-dozen 

degrees, and was perfectly enchanting.  As its effect subsided, she 

fell rapidly, went to sleep for an hour or so at temperate, and 

woke at something below freezing.  Now she was at summer heat 

again, in the shade; and when tea was over, and old John, producing 

a bottle of cordial from one of the oaken cases, insisted on her 

sipping two glasses thereof in slow succession, she stood steadily 

at ninety for one hour and a quarter.  Profiting by experience, the 

locksmith took advantage of this genial weather to smoke his pipe 

in the porch, and in consequence of this prudent management, he was 

fully prepared, when the glass went down again, to start homewards 

directly.



The horse was accordingly put in, and the chaise brought round to 

the door.  Joe, who would on no account be dissuaded from escorting 

them until they had passed the most dreary and solitary part of the 

road, led out the grey mare at the same time; and having helped 

Dolly into her seat (more happiness!) sprung gaily into the saddle.  

Then, after many good nights, and admonitions to wrap up, and 

glancing of lights, and handing in of cloaks and shawls, the chaise 

rolled away, and Joe trotted beside it--on Dolly's side, no doubt, 

and pretty close to the wheel too.
