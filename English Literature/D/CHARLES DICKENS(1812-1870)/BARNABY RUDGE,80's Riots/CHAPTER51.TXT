Promising as these outrages were to Gashford's view, and much like 

business as they looked, they extended that night no farther.  The 

soldiers were again called out, again they took half-a-dozen 

prisoners, and again the crowd dispersed after a short and 

bloodless scuffle.  Hot and drunken though they were, they had not 

yet broken all bounds and set all law and government at defiance.  

Something of their habitual deference to the authority erected by 

society for its own preservation yet remained among them, and had 

its majesty been vindicated in time, the secretary would have had 

to digest a bitter disappointment.



By midnight, the streets were clear and quiet, and, save that there 

stood in two parts of the town a heap of nodding walls and pile of 

rubbish, where there had been at sunset a rich and handsome 

building, everything wore its usual aspect.  Even the Catholic 

gentry and tradesmen, of whom there were many resident in different 

parts of the City and its suburbs, had no fear for their lives or 

property, and but little indignation for the wrong they had already 

sustained in the plunder and destruction of their temples of 

worship.  An honest confidence in the government under whose 

protection they had lived for many years, and a well-founded 

reliance on the good feeling and right thinking of the great mass 

of the community, with whom, notwithstanding their religious 

differences, they were every day in habits of confidential, 

affectionate, and friendly intercourse, reassured them, even under 

the excesses that had been committed; and convinced them that they 

who were Protestants in anything but the name, were no more to be 

considered as abettors of these disgraceful occurrences, than they 

themselves were chargeable with the uses of the block, the rack, 

the gibbet, and the stake in cruel Mary's reign.



The clock was on the stroke of one, when Gabriel Varden, with his 

lady and Miss Miggs, sat waiting in the little parlour.  This fact; 

the toppling wicks of the dull, wasted candles; the silence that 

prevailed; and, above all, the nightcaps of both maid and matron, 

were sufficient evidence that they had been prepared for bed some 

time ago, and had some reason for sitting up so far beyond their 

usual hour.



If any other corroborative testimony had been required, it would 

have been abundantly furnished in the actions of Miss Miggs, who, 

having arrived at that restless state and sensitive condition of 

the nervous system which are the result of long watching, did, by a 

constant rubbing and tweaking of her nose, a perpetual change of 

position (arising from the sudden growth of imaginary knots and 

knobs in her chair), a frequent friction of her eyebrows, the 

incessant recurrence of a small cough, a small groan, a gasp, a 

sigh, a sniff, a spasmodic start, and by other demonstrations of 

that nature, so file down and rasp, as it were, the patience of the 

locksmith, that after looking at her in silence for some time, he 

at last broke out into this apostrophe:--



'Miggs, my good girl, go to bed--do go to bed.  You're really worse 

than the dripping of a hundred water-butts outside the window, or 

the scratching of as many mice behind the wainscot.  I can't bear 

it.  Do go to bed, Miggs.  To oblige me--do.'



'You haven't got nothing to untie, sir,' returned Miss Miggs, 'and 

therefore your requests does not surprise me.  But missis has--and 

while you sit up, mim'--she added, turning to the locksmith's wife, 

'I couldn't, no, not if twenty times the quantity of cold water was 

aperiently running down my back at this moment, go to bed with a 

quiet spirit.'



Having spoken these words, Miss Miggs made divers efforts to rub 

her shoulders in an impossible place, and shivered from head to 

foot; thereby giving the beholders to understand that the imaginary 

cascade was still in full flow, but that a sense of duty upheld her 

under that and all other sufferings, and nerved her to endurance.



Mrs Varden being too sleepy to speak, and Miss Miggs having, as the 

phrase is, said her say, the locksmith had nothing for it but to 

sigh and be as quiet as he could.



But to be quiet with such a basilisk before him was impossible.  

If he looked another way, it was worse to feel that she was rubbing 

her cheek, or twitching her ear, or winking her eye, or making all 

kinds of extraordinary shapes with her nose, than to see her do it.  

If she was for a moment free from any of these complaints, it was 

only because of her foot being asleep, or of her arm having got the 

fidgets, or of her leg being doubled up with the cramp, or of some 

other horrible disorder which racked her whole frame.  If she did 

enjoy a moment's ease, then with her eyes shut and her mouth wide 

open, she would be seen to sit very stiff and upright in her chair; 

then to nod a little way forward, and stop with a jerk; then to nod 

a little farther forward, and stop with another jerk; then to 

recover herself; then to come forward again--lower--lower--lower--

by very slow degrees, until, just as it seemed impossible that she 

could preserve her balance for another instant, and the locksmith 

was about to call out in an agony, to save her from dashing down 

upon her forehead and fracturing her skull, then all of a sudden 

and without the smallest notice, she would come upright and rigid 

again with her eyes open, and in her countenance an expression of 

defiance, sleepy but yet most obstinate, which plainly said, 'I've 

never once closed 'em since I looked at you last, and I'll take my 

oath of it!'



At length, after the clock had struck two, there was a sound at the 

street door, as if somebody had fallen against the knocker by 

accident.  Miss Miggs immediately jumping up and clapping her 

hands, cried with a drowsy mingling of the sacred and profane, 

'Ally Looyer, mim! there's Simmuns's knock!'



'Who's there?' said Gabriel.



'Me!' cried the well-known voice of Mr Tappertit.  Gabriel opened 

the door, and gave him admission.



He did not cut a very insinuating figure, for a man of his stature 

suffers in a crowd; and having been active in yesterday morning's 

work, his dress was literally crushed from head to foot: his hat 

being beaten out of all shape, and his shoes trodden down at heel 

like slippers.  His coat fluttered in strips about him, the buckles 

were torn away both from his knees and feet, half his neckerchief 

was gone, and the bosom of his shirt was rent to tatters.  Yet 

notwithstanding all these personal disadvantages; despite his being 

very weak from heat and fatigue; and so begrimed with mud and dust 

that he might have been in a case, for anything of the real texture 

(either of his skin or apparel) that the eye could discern; he 

stalked haughtily into the parlour, and throwing himself into a 

chair, and endeavouring to thrust his hands into the pockets of his 

small-clothes, which were turned inside out and displayed upon his 

legs, like tassels, surveyed the household with a gloomy dignity.



'Simon,' said the locksmith gravely, 'how comes it that you return 

home at this time of night, and in this condition?  Give me an 

assurance that you have not been among the rioters, and I am 

satisfied.'



'Sir,' replied Mr Tappertit, with a contemptuous look, 'I wonder at 

YOUR assurance in making such demands.'



'You have been drinking,' said the locksmith.



'As a general principle, and in the most offensive sense of the 

words, sir,' returned his journeyman with great self-possession, 

'I consider you a liar.  In that last observation you have 

unintentionally--unintentionally, sir,--struck upon the truth.'



'Martha,' said the locksmith, turning to his wife, and shaking his 

head sorrowfully, while a smile at the absurd figure beside him 

still played upon his open face, 'I trust it may turn out that this 

poor lad is not the victim of the knaves and fools we have so often 

had words about, and who have done so much harm to-day.  If he has 

been at Warwick Street or Duke Street to-night--'



'He has been at neither, sir,' cried Mr Tappertit in a loud voice, 

which he suddenly dropped into a whisper as he repeated, with eyes 

fixed upon the locksmith, 'he has been at neither.'



'I am glad of it, with all my heart,' said the locksmith in a 

serious tone; 'for if he had been, and it could be proved against 

him, Martha, your Great Association would have been to him the cart 

that draws men to the gallows and leaves them hanging in the air.  

It would, as sure as we're alive!'



Mrs Varden was too much scared by Simon's altered manner and 

appearance, and by the accounts of the rioters which had reached 

her ears that night, to offer any retort, or to have recourse to 

her usual matrimonial policy.  Miss Miggs wrung her hands, and 

wept.



'He was not at Duke Street, or at Warwick Street, G. Varden,' said 

Simon, sternly; 'but he WAS at Westminster.  Perhaps, sir, he 

kicked a county member, perhaps, sir, he tapped a lord--you may 

stare, sir, I repeat it--blood flowed from noses, and perhaps he 

tapped a lord.  Who knows?  This,' he added, putting his hand into 

his waistcoat-pocket, and taking out a large tooth, at the sight of 

which both Miggs and Mrs Varden screamed, 'this was a bishop's.  

Beware, G. Varden!'



'Now, I would rather,' said the locksmith hastily, 'have paid five 

hundred pounds, than had this come to pass.  You idiot, do you know 

what peril you stand in?'



'I know it, sir,' replied his journeyman, 'and it is my glory.  I 

was there, everybody saw me there.  I was conspicuous, and 

prominent.  I will abide the consequences.'



The locksmith, really disturbed and agitated, paced to and fro in 

silence--glancing at his former 'prentice every now and then--and 

at length stopping before him, said:



'Get to bed, and sleep for a couple of hours that you may wake 

penitent, and with some of your senses about you.  Be sorry for 

what you have done, and we will try to save you.  If I call him by 

five o'clock,' said Varden, turning hurriedly to his wife, and he 

washes himself clean and changes his dress, he may get to the Tower 

Stairs, and away by the Gravesend tide-boat, before any search is 

made for him.  From there he can easily get on to Canterbury, 

where your cousin will give him work till this storm has blown 

over.  I am not sure that I do right in screening him from the 

punishment he deserves, but he has lived in this house, man and 

boy, for a dozen years, and I should be sorry if for this one day's 

work he made a miserable end.  Lock the front-door, Miggs, and show 

no light towards the street when you go upstairs.  Quick, Simon!  

Get to bed!'



'And do you suppose, sir,' retorted Mr Tappertit, with a thickness 

and slowness of speech which contrasted forcibly with the rapidity 

and earnestness of his kind-hearted master--'and do you suppose, 

sir, that I am base and mean enough to accept your servile 

proposition?--Miscreant!'



'Whatever you please, Sim, but get to bed.  Every minute is of 

consequence.  The light here, Miggs!'



'Yes yes, oh do!  Go to bed directly,' cried the two women 

together.



Mr Tappertit stood upon his feet, and pushing his chair away to 

show that he needed no assistance, answered, swaying himself to and 

fro, and managing his head as if it had no connection whatever with 

his body:



'You spoke of Miggs, sir--Miggs may be smothered!'



'Oh Simmun!' ejaculated that young lady in a faint voice.  'Oh mim!  

Oh sir!  Oh goodness gracious, what a turn he has give me!'



'This family may ALL be smothered, sir,' returned Mr Tappertit, 

after glancing at her with a smile of ineffable disdain, 'excepting 

Mrs V.  I have come here, sir, for her sake, this night.  Mrs 

Varden, take this piece of paper.  It's a protection, ma'am.  You 

may need it.'



With these words he held out at arm's length, a dirty, crumpled 

scrap of writing.  The locksmith took it from him, opened it, and 

read as follows:





'All good friends to our cause, I hope will be particular, and do 

no injury to the property of any true Protestant.  I am well 

assured that the proprietor of this house is a staunch and worthy 

friend to the cause.



GEORGE GORDON.'





'What's this!' said the locksmith, with an altered face.



'Something that'll do you good service, young feller,' replied his 

journeyman, 'as you'll find.  Keep that safe, and where you can 

lay your hand upon it in an instant.  And chalk "No Popery" on your 

door to-morrow night, and for a week to come--that's all.'



'This is a genuine document,' said the locksmith, 'I know, for I 

have seen the hand before.  What threat does it imply?  What devil 

is abroad?'



'A fiery devil,' retorted Sim; 'a flaming, furious devil.  Don't 

you put yourself in its way, or you're done for, my buck.  Be 

warned in time, G. Varden.  Farewell!'



But here the two women threw themselves in his way--especially Miss 

Miggs, who fell upon him with such fervour that she pinned him 

against the wall--and conjured him in moving words not to go forth 

till he was sober; to listen to reason; to think of it; to take 

some rest, and then determine.



'I tell you,' said Mr Tappertit, 'that my mind is made up.  My 

bleeding country calls me and I go!  Miggs, if you don't get out of 

the way, I'll pinch you.'



Miss Miggs, still clinging to the rebel, screamed once 

vociferously--but whether in the distraction of her mind, or 

because of his having executed his threat, is uncertain.



'Release me,' said Simon, struggling to free himself from her 

chaste, but spider-like embrace.  'Let me go!  I have made 

arrangements for you in an altered state of society, and mean to 

provide for you comfortably in life--there!  Will that satisfy 

you?'



'Oh Simmun!' cried Miss Miggs.  'Oh my blessed Simmun!  Oh mim! 

what are my feelings at this conflicting moment!'



Of a rather turbulent description, it would seem; for her nightcap 

had been knocked off in the scuffle, and she was on her knees upon 

the floor, making a strange revelation of blue and yellow curl-

papers, straggling locks of hair, tags of staylaces, and strings of 

it's impossible to say what; panting for breath, clasping her 

hands, turning her eyes upwards, shedding abundance of tears, and 

exhibiting various other symptoms of the acutest mental suffering.



'I leave,' said Simon, turning to his master, with an utter 

disregard of Miggs's maidenly affliction, 'a box of things 

upstairs.  Do what you like with 'em.  I don't want 'em.  I'm never 

coming back here, any more.  Provide yourself, sir, with a 

journeyman; I'm my country's journeyman; henceforward that's MY 

line of business.'



'Be what you like in two hours' time, but now go up to bed,' 

returned the locksmith, planting himself in the doorway.  'Do you 

hear me?  Go to bed!'



'I hear you, and defy you, Varden,' rejoined Simon Tappertit.  

'This night, sir, I have been in the country, planning an 

expedition which shall fill your bell-hanging soul with wonder and 

dismay.  The plot demands my utmost energy.  Let me pass!'



'I'll knock you down if you come near the door,' replied the 

locksmith.  'You had better go to bed!'



Simon made no answer, but gathering himself up as straight as he 

could, plunged head foremost at his old master, and the two went 

driving out into the workshop together, plying their hands and feet 

so briskly that they looked like half-a-dozen, while Miggs and Mrs 

Varden screamed for twelve.



It would have been easy for Varden to knock his old 'prentice down, 

and bind him hand and foot; but as he was loth to hurt him in his 

then defenceless state, he contented himself with parrying his 

blows when he could, taking them in perfect good part when he could 

not, and keeping between him and the door, until a favourable 

opportunity should present itself for forcing him to retreat up-

stairs, and shutting him up in his own room.  But, in the goodness 

of his heart, he calculated too much upon his adversary's weakness, 

and forgot that drunken men who have lost the power of walking 

steadily, can often run.  Watching his time, Simon Tappertit made a 

cunning show of falling back, staggered unexpectedly forward, 

brushed past him, opened the door (he knew the trick of that lock 

well), and darted down the street like a mad dog.  The locksmith 

paused for a moment in the excess of his astonishment, and then 

gave chase.



It was an excellent season for a run, for at that silent hour the 

streets were deserted, the air was cool, and the flying figure 

before him distinctly visible at a great distance, as it sped away, 

with a long gaunt shadow following at its heels.  But the short-

winded locksmith had no chance against a man of Sim's youth and 

spare figure, though the day had been when he could have run him 

down in no time.  The space between them rapidly increased, and as 

the rays of the rising sun streamed upon Simon in the act of 

turning a distant corner, Gabriel Varden was fain to give up, and 

sit down on a doorstep to fetch his breath.  Simon meanwhile, 

without once stopping, fled at the same degree of swiftness to The 

Boot, where, as he well knew, some of his company were lying, and 

at which respectable hostelry--for he had already acquired the 

distinction of being in great peril of the law--a friendly watch 

had been expecting him all night, and was even now on the look-out 

for his coming.



'Go thy ways, Sim, go thy ways,' said the locksmith, as soon as he 

could speak.  'I have done my best for thee, poor lad, and would 

have saved thee, but the rope is round thy neck, I fear.'



So saying, and shaking his head in a very sorrowful and 

disconsolate manner, he turned back, and soon re-entered his own 

house, where Mrs Varden and the faithful Miggs had been anxiously 

expecting his return.



Now Mrs Varden (and by consequence Miss Miggs likewise) was 

impressed with a secret misgiving that she had done wrong; that she 

had, to the utmost of her small means, aided and abetted the growth 

of disturbances, the end of which it was impossible to foresee; 

that she had led remotely to the scene which had just passed; and 

that the locksmith's time for triumph and reproach had now arrived 

indeed.  And so strongly did Mrs Varden feel this, and so 

crestfallen was she in consequence, that while her husband was 

pursuing their lost journeyman, she secreted under her chair the 

little red-brick dwelling-house with the yellow roof, lest it 

should furnish new occasion for reference to the painful theme; and 

now hid the same still more, with the skirts of her dress.



But it happened that the locksmith had been thinking of this very 

article on his way home, and that, coming into the room and not 

seeing it, he at once demanded where it was.



Mrs Varden had no resource but to produce it, which she did with 

many tears, and broken protestations that if she could have known--



'Yes, yes,' said Varden, 'of course--I know that.  I don't mean to 

reproach you, my dear.  But recollect from this time that all good 

things perverted to evil purposes, are worse than those which are 

naturally bad.  A thoroughly wicked woman, is wicked indeed.  When 

religion goes wrong, she is very wrong, for the same reason.  Let 

us say no more about it, my dear.'



So he dropped the red-brick dwelling-house on the floor, and 

setting his heel upon it, crushed it into pieces.  The halfpence, 

and sixpences, and other voluntary contributions, rolled about in 

all directions, but nobody offered to touch them, or to take them 

up.



'That,' said the locksmith, 'is easily disposed of, and I would to 

Heaven that everything growing out of the same society could be 

settled as easily.'



'It happens very fortunately, Varden,' said his wife, with her 

handkerchief to her eyes, 'that in case any more disturbances 

should happen--which I hope not; I sincerely hope not--'



'I hope so too, my dear.'



'--That in case any should occur, we have the piece of paper which 

that poor misguided young man brought.'



'Ay, to be sure,' said the locksmith, turning quickly round.  

'Where is that piece of paper?'



Mrs Varden stood aghast as he took it from her outstretched band, 

tore it into fragments, and threw them under the grate.



'Not use it?' she said.



'Use it!' cried the locksmith.  No!  Let them come and pull the 

roof about our ears; let them burn us out of house and home; I'd 

neither have the protection of their leader, nor chalk their howl 

upon my door, though, for not doing it, they shot me on my own 

threshold.  Use it!  Let them come and do their worst.  The first 

man who crosses my doorstep on such an errand as theirs, had better 

be a hundred miles away.  Let him look to it.  The others may have 

their will.  I wouldn't beg or buy them off, if, instead of every 

pound of iron in the place, there was a hundred weight of gold.  

Get you to bed, Martha.  I shall take down the shutters and go to 

work.'



'So early!' said his wife.



'Ay,' replied the locksmith cheerily, 'so early.  Come when they 

may, they shall not find us skulking and hiding, as if we feared to 

take our portion of the light of day, and left it all to them.  So 

pleasant dreams to you, my dear, and cheerful sleep!'



With that he gave his wife a hearty kiss, and bade her delay no 

longer, or it would be time to rise before she lay down to rest.  

Mrs Varden quite amiably and meekly walked upstairs, followed by 

Miggs, who, although a good deal subdued, could not refrain from 

sundry stimulative coughs and sniffs by the way, or from holding up 

her hands in astonishment at the daring conduct of master.
