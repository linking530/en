They were not long in reaching the barracks, for the officer who 

commanded the party was desirous to avoid rousing the people by the 

display of military force in the streets, and was humanely anxious 

to give as little opportunity as possible for any attempt at 

rescue; knowing that it must lead to bloodshed and loss of life, 

and that if the civil authorities by whom he was accompanied, 

empowered him to order his men to fire, many innocent persons would 

probably fall, whom curiosity or idleness had attracted to the 

spot.  He therefore led the party briskly on, avoiding with a 

merciful prudence the more public and crowded thoroughfares, and 

pursuing those which he deemed least likely to be infested by 

disorderly persons.  This wise proceeding not only enabled them to 

gain their quarters without any interruption, but completely 

baffled a body of rioters who had assembled in one of the main 

streets, through which it was considered certain they would pass, 

and who remained gathered together for the purpose of releasing the 

prisoner from their hands, long after they had deposited him in a 

place of security, closed the barrack-gates, and set a double guard 

at every entrance for its better protection.



Arrived at this place, poor Barnaby was marched into a stone-

floored room, where there was a very powerful smell of tobacco, a 

strong thorough draught of air, and a great wooden bedstead, large 

enough for a score of men.  Several soldiers in undress were 

lounging about, or eating from tin cans; military accoutrements 

dangled on rows of pegs along the whitewashed wall; and some half-

dozen men lay fast asleep upon their backs, snoring in concert.  

After remaining here just long enough to note these things, he was 

marched out again, and conveyed across the parade-ground to another 

portion of the building.



Perhaps a man never sees so much at a glance as when he is in a 

situation of extremity.  The chances are a hundred to one, that if 

Barnaby had lounged in at the gate to look about him, he would have 

lounged out again with a very imperfect idea of the place, and 

would have remembered very little about it.  But as he was taken 

handcuffed across the gravelled area, nothing escaped his notice.  

The dry, arid look of the dusty square, and of the bare brick 

building; the clothes hanging at some of the windows; and the men 

in their shirt-sleeves and braces, lolling with half their bodies 

out of the others; the green sun-blinds at the officers' quarters, 

and the little scanty trees in front; the drummer-boys practising 

in a distant courtyard; the men at drill on the parade; the two 

soldiers carrying a basket between them, who winked to each other 

as he went by, and slily pointed to their throats; the spruce 

serjeant who hurried past with a cane in his hand, and under his 

arm a clasped book with a vellum cover; the fellows in the ground-

floor rooms, furbishing and brushing up their different articles of 

dress, who stopped to look at him, and whose voices as they spoke 

together echoed loudly through the empty galleries and passages;--

everything, down to the stand of muskets before the guard-house, 

and the drum with a pipe-clayed belt attached, in one corner, 

impressed itself upon his observation, as though he had noticed 

them in the same place a hundred times, or had been a whole day 

among them, in place of one brief hurried minute.



He was taken into a small paved back yard, and there they opened a 

great door, plated with iron, and pierced some five feet above the 

ground with a few holes to let in air and light.  Into this dungeon 

he was walked straightway; and having locked him up there, and 

placed a sentry over him, they left him to his meditations.



The cell, or black hole, for it had those words painted on the 

door, was very dark, and having recently accommodated a drunken 

deserter, by no means clean.  Barnaby felt his way to some straw at 

the farther end, and looking towards the door, tried to accustom 

himself to the gloom, which, coming from the bright sunshine out of 

doors, was not an easy task.



There was a kind of portico or colonnade outside, and this 

obstructed even the little light that at the best could have found 

its way through the small apertures in the door.  The footsteps of 

the sentinel echoed monotonously as he paced its stone pavement to 

and fro (reminding Barnaby of the watch he had so lately kept 

himself); and as he passed and repassed the door, he made the cell 

for an instant so black by the interposition of his body, that his 

going away again seemed like the appearance of a new ray of light, 

and was quite a circumstance to look for.



When the prisoner had sat sometime upon the ground, gazing at the 

chinks, and listening to the advancing and receding footsteps of 

his guard, the man stood still upon his post.  Barnaby, quite 

unable to think, or to speculate on what would be done with him, 

had been lulled into a kind of doze by his regular pace; but his 

stopping roused him; and then he became aware that two men were in 

conversation under the colonnade, and very near the door of his 

cell.



How long they had been talking there, he could not tell, for he had 

fallen into an unconsciousness of his real position, and when the 

footsteps ceased, was answering aloud some question which seemed to 

have been put to him by Hugh in the stable, though of the fancied 

purport, either of question or reply, notwithstanding that he awoke 

with the latter on his lips, he had no recollection whatever.  The 

first words that reached his ears, were these:



'Why is he brought here then, if he has to be taken away again so 

soon?'



'Why where would you have him go!  Damme, he's not as safe anywhere 

as among the king's troops, is he?  What WOULD you do with him?  

Would you hand him over to a pack of cowardly civilians, that shake 

in their shoes till they wear the soles out, with trembling at the 

threats of the ragamuffins he belongs to?'



'That's true enough.'



'True enough!--I'll tell you what.  I wish, Tom Green, that I was a 

commissioned instead of a non-commissioned officer, and that I had 

the command of two companies--only two companies--of my own 

regiment.  Call me out to stop these riots--give me the needful 

authority, and half-a-dozen rounds of ball cartridge--'



'Ay!' said the other voice.  'That's all very well, but they won't 

give the needful authority.  If the magistrate won't give the 

word, what's the officer to do?'



Not very well knowing, as it seemed, how to overcome this 

difficulty, the other man contented himself with damning the 

magistrates.



'With all my heart,' said his friend.



'Where's the use of a magistrate?' returned the other voice.  

'What's a magistrate in this case, but an impertinent, unnecessary, 

unconstitutional sort of interference?  Here's a proclamation.  

Here's a man referred to in that proclamation.  Here's proof 

against him, and a witness on the spot.  Damme!  Take him out and 

shoot him, sir.  Who wants a magistrate?'



'When does he go before Sir John Fielding?' asked the man who had 

spoken first.



'To-night at eight o'clock,' returned the other.  'Mark what 

follows.  The magistrate commits him to Newgate.  Our people take 

him to Newgate.  The rioters pelt our people.  Our people retire 

before the rioters.  Stones are thrown, insults are offered, not a 

shot's fired.  Why?  Because of the magistrates.  Damn the 

magistrates!'



When he had in some degree relieved his mind by cursing the 

magistrates in various other forms of speech, the man was silent, 

save for a low growling, still having reference to those 

authorities, which from time to time escaped him.



Barnaby, who had wit enough to know that this conversation 

concerned, and very nearly concerned, himself, remained perfectly 

quiet until they ceased to speak, when he groped his way to the 

door, and peeping through the air-holes, tried to make out what 

kind of men they were, to whom he had been listening.



The one who condemned the civil power in such strong terms, was a 

serjeant--engaged just then, as the streaming ribands in his cap 

announced, on the recruiting service.  He stood leaning sideways 

against a pillar nearly opposite the door, and as he growled to 

himself, drew figures on the pavement with his cane.  The other 

man had his back towards the dungeon, and Barnaby could only see 

his form.  To judge from that, he was a gallant, manly, handsome 

fellow, but he had lost his left arm.  It had been taken off 

between the elbow and the shoulder, and his empty coat-sleeve hung 

across his breast.



It was probably this circumstance which gave him an interest beyond 

any that his companion could boast of, and attracted Barnaby's 

attention.  There was something soldierly in his bearing, and he 

wore a jaunty cap and jacket.  Perhaps he had been in the service 

at one time or other.  If he had, it could not have been very long 

ago, for he was but a young fellow now.



'Well, well,' he said thoughtfully; 'let the fault be where it may, 

it makes a man sorrowful to come back to old England, and see her 

in this condition.'



'I suppose the pigs will join 'em next,' said the serjeant, with an 

imprecation on the rioters, 'now that the birds have set 'em the 

example.'



'The birds!' repeated Tom Green.



'Ah--birds,' said the serjeant testily; 'that's English, an't it?'



'I don't know what you mean.'



'Go to the guard-house, and see.  You'll find a bird there, that's 

got their cry as pat as any of 'em, and bawls "No Popery," like a 

man--or like a devil, as he says he is.  I shouldn't wonder.  The 

devil's loose in London somewhere.  Damme if I wouldn't twist his 

neck round, on the chance, if I had MY way.'



The young man had taken two or three steps away, as if to go and 

see this creature, when he was arrested by the voice of Barnaby.



'It's mine,' he called out, half laughing and half weeping--'my 

pet, my friend Grip.  Ha ha ha!  Don't hurt him, he has done no 

harm.  I taught him; it's my fault.  Let me have him, if you 

please.  He's the only friend I have left now.  He'll not dance, or 

talk, or whistle for you, I know; but he will for me, because he 

knows me and loves me--though you wouldn't think it--very well.  

You wouldn't hurt a bird, I'm sure.  You're a brave soldier, sir, 

and wouldn't harm a woman or a child--no, no, nor a poor bird, I'm 

certain.'



This latter adjuration was addressed to the serjeant, whom Barnaby 

judged from his red coat to be high in office, and able to seal 

Grip's destiny by a word.  But that gentleman, in reply, surlily 

damned him for a thief and rebel as he was, and with many 

disinterested imprecations on his own eyes, liver, blood, and body, 

assured him that if it rested with him to decide, he would put a 

final stopper on the bird, and his master too.



'You talk boldly to a caged man,' said Barnaby, in anger.  'If I 

was on the other side of the door and there were none to part us, 

you'd change your note--ay, you may toss your head--you would!  

Kill the bird--do.  Kill anything you can, and so revenge yourself 

on those who with their bare hands untied could do as much to you!'



Having vented his defiance, he flung himself into the furthest 

corner of his prison, and muttering, 'Good bye, Grip--good bye, 

dear old Grip!' shed tears for the first time since he had been 

taken captive; and hid his face in the straw.



He had had some fancy at first, that the one-armed man would help 

him, or would give him a kind word in answer.  He hardly knew why, 

but he hoped and thought so.  The young fellow had stopped when he 

called out, and checking himself in the very act of turning round, 

stood listening to every word he said.  Perhaps he built his feeble 

trust on this; perhaps on his being young, and having a frank and 

honest manner.  However that might be, he built on sand.  The other 

went away directly he had finished speaking, and neither answered 

him, nor returned.  No matter.  They were all against him here: he 

might have known as much.  Good bye, old Grip, good bye!



After some time, they came and unlocked the door, and called to him 

to come out.  He rose directly, and complied, for he would not have 

THEM think he was subdued or frightened.  He walked out like a man, 

and looked from face to face.



None of them returned his gaze or seemed to notice it.  They 

marched him back to the parade by the way they had brought him, and 

there they halted, among a body of soldiers, at least twice as 

numerous as that which had taken him prisoner in the afternoon.  

The officer he had seen before, bade him in a few brief words take 

notice that if he attempted to escape, no matter how favourable a 

chance he might suppose he had, certain of the men had orders to 

fire upon him, that moment.  They then closed round him as before, 

and marched him off again.



In the same unbroken order they arrived at Bow Street, followed and 

beset on all sides by a crowd which was continually increasing.  

Here he was placed before a blind gentleman, and asked if he wished 

to say anything.  Not he.  What had he got to tell them?  After a 

very little talking, which he was careless of and quite indifferent 

to, they told him he was to go to Newgate, and took him away.



He went out into the street, so surrounded and hemmed in on every 

side by soldiers, that he could see nothing; but he knew there was 

a great crowd of people, by the murmur; and that they were not 

friendly to the soldiers, was soon rendered evident by their yells 

and hisses.  How often and how eagerly he listened for the voice of 

Hugh!  There was not a voice he knew among them all.  Was Hugh a 

prisoner too?  Was there no hope!



As they came nearer and nearer to the prison, the hootings of the 

people grew more violent; stones were thrown; and every now and 

then, a rush was made against the soldiers, which they staggered 

under.  One of them, close before him, smarting under a blow upon 

the temple, levelled his musket, but the officer struck it upwards 

with his sword, and ordered him on peril of his life to desist.  

This was the last thing he saw with any distinctness, for directly 

afterwards he was tossed about, and beaten to and fro, as though in 

a tempestuous sea.  But go where he would, there were the same 

guards about him.  Twice or thrice he was thrown down, and so were 

they; but even then, he could not elude their vigilance for a 

moment.  They were up again, and had closed about him, before he, 

with his wrists so tightly bound, could scramble to his feet.  

Fenced in, thus, he felt himself hoisted to the top of a low flight 

of steps, and then for a moment he caught a glimpse of the fighting 

in the crowd, and of a few red coats sprinkled together, here and 

there, struggling to rejoin their fellows.  Next moment, everything 

was dark and gloomy, and he was standing in the prison lobby; the 

centre of a group of men.



A smith was speedily in attendance, who riveted upon him a set of 

heavy irons.  Stumbling on as well as he could, beneath the unusual 

burden of these fetters, he was conducted to a strong stone cell, 

where, fastening the door with locks, and bolts, and chains, they 

left him, well secured; having first, unseen by him, thrust in 

Grip, who, with his head drooping and his deep black plumes rough 

and rumpled, appeared to comprehend and to partake, his master's 

fallen fortunes.
