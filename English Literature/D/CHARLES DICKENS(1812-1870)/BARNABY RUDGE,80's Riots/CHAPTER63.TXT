During the whole of this day, every regiment in or near the 

metropolis was on duty in one or other part of the town; and the 

regulars and militia, in obedience to the orders which were sent to 

every barrack and station within twenty-four hours' journey, began 

to pour in by all the roads.  But the disturbance had attained to 

such a formidable height, and the rioters had grown, with impunity, 

to be so audacious, that the sight of this great force, continually 

augmented by new arrivals, instead of operating as a check, 

stimulated them to outrages of greater hardihood than any they had 

yet committed; and helped to kindle a flame in London, the like of 

which had never been beheld, even in its ancient and rebellious 

times.



All yesterday, and on this day likewise, the commander-in-chief 

endeavoured to arouse the magistrates to a sense of their duty, and 

in particular the Lord Mayor, who was the faintest-hearted and most 

timid of them all.  With this object, large bodies of the soldiery 

were several times despatched to the Mansion House to await his 

orders: but as he could, by no threats or persuasions, be induced 

to give any, and as the men remained in the open street, 

fruitlessly for any good purpose, and thrivingly for a very bad 

one; these laudable attempts did harm rather than good.  For the 

crowd, becoming speedily acquainted with the Lord Mayor's temper, 

did not fail to take advantage of it by boasting that even the 

civil authorities were opposed to the Papists, and could not find 

it in their hearts to molest those who were guilty of no other 

offence.  These vaunts they took care to make within the hearing of 

the soldiers; and they, being naturally loth to quarrel with the 

people, received their advances kindly enough: answering, when 

they were asked if they desired to fire upon their countrymen, 'No, 

they would be damned if they did;' and showing much honest 

simplicity and good nature.  The feeling that the military were No-

Popery men, and were ripe for disobeying orders and joining the 

mob, soon became very prevalent in consequence.  Rumours of their 

disaffection, and of their leaning towards the popular cause, 

spread from mouth to mouth with astonishing rapidity; and whenever 

they were drawn up idly in the streets or squares, there was sure 

to be a crowd about them, cheering and shaking hands, and treating 

them with a great show of confidence and affection.



By this time, the crowd was everywhere; all concealment and 

disguise were laid aside, and they pervaded the whole town.  If 

any man among them wanted money, he had but to knock at the door of 

a dwelling-house, or walk into a shop, and demand it in the rioters 

name; and his demand was instantly complied with.  The peaceable 

citizens being afraid to lay hands upon them, singly and alone, it 

may be easily supposed that when gathered together in bodies, they 

were perfectly secure from interruption.  They assembled in the 

streets, traversed them at their will and pleasure, and publicly 

concerted their plans.  Business was quite suspended; the greater 

part of the shops were closed; most of the houses displayed a blue 

flag in token of their adherence to the popular side; and even the 

Jews in Houndsditch, Whitechapel, and those quarters, wrote upon 

their doors or window-shutters, 'This House is a True Protestant.'  

The crowd was the law, and never was the law held in greater dread, 

or more implicitly obeyed.



It was about six o'clock in the evening, when a vast mob poured 

into Lincoln's Inn Fields by every avenue, and divided--evidently 

in pursuance of a previous design--into several parties.  It must 

not be understood that this arrangement was known to the whole 

crowd, but that it was the work of a few leaders; who, mingling 

with the men as they came upon the ground, and calling to them to 

fall into this or that parry, effected it as rapidly as if it had 

been determined on by a council of the whole number, and every man 

had known his place.



It was perfectly notorious to the assemblage that the largest 

body, which comprehended about two-thirds of the whole, was 

designed for the attack on Newgate.  It comprehended all the 

rioters who had been conspicuous in any of their former 

proceedings; all those whom they recommended as daring hands and 

fit for the work; all those whose companions had been taken in the 

riots; and a great number of people who were relatives or friends 

of felons in the jail.  This last class included, not only the most 

desperate and utterly abandoned villains in London, but some who 

were comparatively innocent.  There was more than one woman there, 

disguised in man's attire, and bent upon the rescue of a child or 

brother.  There were the two sons of a man who lay under sentence 

of death, and who was to be executed along with three others, on 

the next day but one.  There was a great parry of boys whose 

fellow-pickpockets were in the prison; and at the skirts of all, 

a score of miserable women, outcasts from the world, seeking to 

release some other fallen creature as miserable as themselves, or 

moved by a general sympathy perhaps--God knows--with all who were 

without hope, and wretched.



Old swords, and pistols without ball or powder; sledge-hammers, 

knives, axes, saws, and weapons pillaged from the butchers' shops; 

a forest of iron bars and wooden clubs; long ladders for scaling 

the walls, each carried on the shoulders of a dozen men; lighted 

torches; tow smeared with pitch, and tar, and brimstone; staves 

roughly plucked from fence and paling; and even crutches taken from 

crippled beggars in the streets; composed their arms.  When all was 

ready, Hugh and Dennis, with Simon Tappertit between them, led the 

way.  Roaring and chafing like an angry sea, the crowd pressed 

after them.



Instead of going straight down Holborn to the jail, as all 

expected, their leaders took the way to Clerkenwell, and pouring 

down a quiet street, halted before a locksmith's house--the Golden 

Key.



'Beat at the door,' cried Hugh to the men about him.  'We want one 

of his craft to-night.  Beat it in, if no one answers.'



The shop was shut.  Both door and shutters were of a strong and 

sturdy kind, and they knocked without effect.  But the impatient 

crowd raising a cry of 'Set fire to the house!' and torches being 

passed to the front, an upper window was thrown open, and the stout 

old locksmith stood before them.



'What now, you villains!' he demanded.  'Where is my daughter?'



'Ask no questions of us, old man,' retorted Hugh, waving his 

comrades to be silent, 'but come down, and bring the tools of your 

trade.  We want you.'



'Want me!' cried the locksmith, glancing at the regimental dress he 

wore: 'Ay, and if some that I could name possessed the hearts of 

mice, ye should have had me long ago.  Mark me, my lad--and you 

about him do the same.  There are a score among ye whom I see now 

and know, who are dead men from this hour.  Begone! and rob an 

undertaker's while you can!  You'll want some coffins before long.'



'Will you come down?' cried Hugh.



'Will you give me my daughter, ruffian?' cried the locksmith.



'I know nothing of her,' Hugh rejoined.  'Burn the door!'



'Stop!' cried the locksmith, in a voice that made them falter--

presenting, as he spoke, a gun.  'Let an old man do that.  You can 

spare him better.'



The young fellow who held the light, and who was stooping down 

before the door, rose hastily at these words, and fell back.  The 

locksmith ran his eye along the upturned faces, and kept the weapon 

levelled at the threshold of his house.  It had no other rest than 

his shoulder, but was as steady as the house itself.



'Let the man who does it, take heed to his prayers,' he said 

firmly; 'I warn him.'



Snatching a torch from one who stood near him, Hugh was stepping 

forward with an oath, when he was arrested by a shrill and piercing 

shriek, and, looking upward, saw a fluttering garment on the house-

top.



There was another shriek, and another, and then a shrill voice 

cried, 'Is Simmun below!' At the same moment a lean neck was 

stretched over the parapet, and Miss Miggs, indistinctly seen in 

the gathering gloom of evening, screeched in a frenzied manner, 

'Oh! dear gentlemen, let me hear Simmuns's answer from his own 

lips.  Speak to me, Simmun.  Speak to me!'



Mr Tappertit, who was not at all flattered by this compliment, 

looked up, and bidding her hold her peace, ordered her to come down 

and open the door, for they wanted her master, and would take no 

denial.



'Oh good gentlemen!' cried Miss Miggs.  'Oh my own precious, 

precious Simmun--'



'Hold your nonsense, will you!' retorted Mr Tappertit; 'and come 

down and open the door.--G. Varden, drop that gun, or it will be 

worse for you.'



'Don't mind his gun,' screamed Miggs.  'Simmun and gentlemen, I 

poured a mug of table-beer right down the barrel.'



The crowd gave a loud shout, which was followed by a roar of 

laughter.



'It wouldn't go off, not if you was to load it up to the muzzle,' 

screamed Miggs.  'Simmun and gentlemen, I'm locked up in the front 

attic, through the little door on the right hand when you think 

you've got to the very top of the stairs--and up the flight of 

corner steps, being careful not to knock your heads against the 

rafters, and not to tread on one side in case you should fall into 

the two-pair bedroom through the lath and plasture, which do not 

bear, but the contrairy.  Simmun and gentlemen, I've been locked up 

here for safety, but my endeavours has always been, and always will 

be, to be on the right side--the blessed side and to prenounce the 

Pope of Babylon, and all her inward and her outward workings, which 

is Pagin.  My sentiments is of little consequences, I know,' cried 

Miggs, with additional shrillness, 'for my positions is but a 

servant, and as sich, of humilities, still I gives expressions to 

my feelings, and places my reliances on them which entertains my 

own opinions!'



Without taking much notice of these outpourings of Miss Miggs after 

she had made her first announcement in relation to the gun, the 

crowd raised a ladder against the window where the locksmith stood, 

and notwithstanding that he closed, and fastened, and defended it 

manfully, soon forced an entrance by shivering the glass and 

breaking in the frames.  After dealing a few stout blows about him, 

he found himself defenceless, in the midst of a furious crowd, 

which overflowed the room and softened off in a confused heap of 

faces at the door and window.



They were very wrathful with him (for he had wounded two men), and 

even called out to those in front, to bring him forth and hang him 

on a lamp-post.  But Gabriel was quite undaunted, and looked from 

Hugh and Dennis, who held him by either arm, to Simon Tappertit, 

who confronted him.



'You have robbed me of my daughter,' said the locksmith, 'who is 

far dearer to me than my life; and you may take my life, if you 

will.  I bless God that I have been enabled to keep my wife free of 

this scene; and that He has made me a man who will not ask mercy at 

such hands as yours.'



'And a wery game old gentleman you are,' said Mr Dennis, 

approvingly; 'and you express yourself like a man.  What's the 

odds, brother, whether it's a lamp-post to-night, or a feather-

bed ten year to come, eh?'



The locksmith glanced at him disdainfully, but returned no other 

answer.



'For my part,' said the hangman, who particularly favoured the 

lamp-post suggestion, 'I honour your principles.  They're mine 

exactly.  In such sentiments as them,' and here he emphasised his 

discourse with an oath, 'I'm ready to meet you or any man halfway.--

Have you got a bit of cord anywheres handy?  Don't put yourself 

out of the way, if you haven't.  A handkecher will do.'



'Don't be a fool, master,' whispered Hugh, seizing Varden roughly 

by the shoulder; 'but do as you're bid.  You'll soon hear what 

you're wanted for.  Do it!'



'I'll do nothing at your request, or that of any scoundrel here,' 

returned the locksmith.  'If you want any service from me, you may 

spare yourselves the pains of telling me what it is.  I tell you, 

beforehand, I'll do nothing for you.'



Mr Dennis was so affected by this constancy on the part of the 

staunch old man, that he protested--almost with tears in his eyes--

that to baulk his inclinations would be an act of cruelty and hard 

dealing to which he, for one, never could reconcile his conscience.  

The gentleman, he said, had avowed in so many words that he was 

ready for working off; such being the case, he considered it their 

duty, as a civilised and enlightened crowd, to work him off.  It 

was not often, he observed, that they had it in their power to 

accommodate themselves to the wishes of those from whom they had 

the misfortune to differ.  Having now found an individual who 

expressed a desire which they could reasonably indulge (and for 

himself he was free to confess that in his opinion that desire did 

honour to his feelings), he hoped they would decide to accede to 

his proposition before going any further.  It was an experiment 

which, skilfully and dexterously performed, would be over in five 

minutes, with great comfort and satisfaction to all parties; and 

though it did not become him (Mr Dennis) to speak well of himself 

he trusted he might be allowed to say that he had practical 

knowledge of the subject, and, being naturally of an obliging and 

friendly disposition, would work the gentleman off with a deal of 

pleasure.



These remarks, which were addressed in the midst of a frightful din 

and turmoil to those immediately about him, were received with 

great favour; not so much, perhaps, because of the hangman's 

eloquence, as on account of the locksmith's obstinacy.  Gabriel was 

in imminent peril, and he knew it; but he preserved a steady 

silence; and would have done so, if they had been debating whether 

they should roast him at a slow fire.



As the hangman spoke, there was some stir and confusion on the 

ladder; and directly he was silent--so immediately upon his holding 

his peace, that the crowd below had no time to learn what he had 

been saying, or to shout in response--some one at the window cried:



'He has a grey head.  He is an old man: Don't hurt him!'



The locksmith turned, with a start, towards the place from which 

the words had come, and looked hurriedly at the people who were 

hanging on the ladder and clinging to each other.



'Pay no respect to my grey hair, young man,' he said, answering the 

voice and not any one he saw.  'I don't ask it.  My heart is green 

enough to scorn and despise every man among you, band of robbers 

that you are!'



This incautious speech by no means tended to appease the ferocity 

of the crowd.  They cried again to have him brought out; and it 

would have gone hard with the honest locksmith, but that Hugh 

reminded them, in answer, that they wanted his services, and must 

have them.



'So, tell him what we want,' he said to Simon Tappertit, 'and 

quickly.  And open your ears, master, if you would ever use them 

after to-night.'



Gabriel folded his arms, which were now at liberty, and eyed his 

old 'prentice in silence.



'Lookye, Varden,' said Sim, 'we're bound for Newgate.'



'I know you are,' returned the locksmith.  'You never said a truer 

word than that.'



'To burn it down, I mean,' said Simon, 'and force the gates, and 

set the prisoners at liberty.  You helped to make the lock of the 

great door.'



'I did,' said the locksmith.  'You owe me no thanks for that--as 

you'll find before long.'



'Maybe,' returned his journeyman, 'but you must show us how to 

force it.'



'Must I!'



'Yes; for you know, and I don't.  You must come along with us, and 

pick it with your own hands.'



'When I do,' said the locksmith quietly, 'my hands shall drop off 

at the wrists, and you shall wear them, Simon Tappertit, on your 

shoulders for epaulettes.'



'We'll see that,' cried Hugh, interposing, as the indignation of 

the crowd again burst forth.  'You fill a basket with the tools 

he'll want, while I bring him downstairs.  Open the doors below, 

some of you.  And light the great captain, others!  Is there no 

business afoot, my lads, that you can do nothing but stand and 

grumble?'



They looked at one another, and quickly dispersing, swarmed over 

the house, plundering and breaking, according to their custom, and 

carrying off such articles of value as happened to please their 

fancy.  They had no great length of time for these proceedings, for 

the basket of tools was soon prepared and slung over a man's 

shoulders.  The preparations being now completed, and everything 

ready for the attack, those who were pillaging and destroying in 

the other rooms were called down to the workshop.  They were about 

to issue forth, when the man who had been last upstairs, stepped 

forward, and asked if the young woman in the garret (who was making 

a terrible noise, he said, and kept on screaming without the least 

cessation) was to be released?



For his own part, Simon Tappertit would certainly have replied in 

the negative, but the mass of his companions, mindful of the good 

service she had done in the matter of the gun, being of a different 

opinion, he had nothing for it but to answer, Yes.  The man, 

accordingly, went back again to the rescue, and presently returned 

with Miss Miggs, limp and doubled up, and very damp from much 

weeping.



As the young lady had given no tokens of consciousness on their way 

downstairs, the bearer reported her either dead or dying; and being 

at some loss what to do with her, was looking round for a 

convenient bench or heap of ashes on which to place her senseless 

form, when she suddenly came upon her feet by some mysterious 

means, thrust back her hair, stared wildly at Mr Tappertit, cried, 

'My Simmuns's life is not a wictim!' and dropped into his arms with 

such promptitude that he staggered and reeled some paces back, 

beneath his lovely burden.



'Oh bother!' said Mr Tappertit.  'Here.  Catch hold of her, 

somebody.  Lock her up again; she never ought to have been let out.'



'My Simmun!' cried Miss Miggs, in tears, and faintly.  'My for 

ever, ever blessed Simmun!'



'Hold up, will you,' said Mr Tappertit, in a very unresponsive 

tone, 'I'll let you fall if you don't.  What are you sliding your 

feet off the ground for?'



'My angel Simmuns!' murmured Miggs--'he promised--'



'Promised!  Well, and I'll keep my promise,' answered Simon, 

testily.  'I mean to provide for you, don't I?  Stand up!'



'Where am I to go?  What is to become of me after my actions of 

this night!' cried Miggs.  'What resting-places now remains but in 

the silent tombses!'



'I wish you was in the silent tombses, I do,' cried Mr Tappertit, 

'and boxed up tight, in a good strong one.  Here,' he cried to one 

of the bystanders, in whose ear he whispered for a moment: 'Take 

her off, will you.  You understand where?'



The fellow nodded; and taking her in his arms, notwithstanding her 

broken protestations, and her struggles (which latter species of 

opposition, involving scratches, was much more difficult of 

resistance), carried her away.  They who were in the house poured 

out into the street; the locksmith was taken to the head of the 

crowd, and required to walk between his two conductors; the whole 

body was put in rapid motion; and without any shouts or noise they 

bore down straight on Newgate, and halted in a dense mass before 

the prison-gate.
