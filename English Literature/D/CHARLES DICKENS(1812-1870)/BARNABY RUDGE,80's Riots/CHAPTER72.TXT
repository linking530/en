The Black Lion was so far off, and occupied such a length of time 

in the getting at, that notwithstanding the strong presumptive 

evidence she had about her of the late events being real and of 

actual occurrence, Dolly could not divest herself of the belief 

that she must be in a dream which was lasting all night.  Nor was 

she quite certain that she saw and heard with her own proper 

senses, even when the coach, in the fulness of time, stopped at the 

Black Lion, and the host of that tavern approached in a gush of 

cheerful light to help them to dismount, and give them hearty 

welcome.



There too, at the coach door, one on one side, one upon the other, 

were already Edward Chester and Joe Willet, who must have followed 

in another coach: and this was such a strange and unaccountable 

proceeding, that Dolly was the more inclined to favour the idea of 

her being fast asleep.  But when Mr Willet appeared--old John 

himself--so heavy-headed and obstinate, and with such a double 

chin as the liveliest imagination could never in its boldest 

flights have conjured up in all its vast proportions--then she 

stood corrected, and unwillingly admitted to herself that she was 

broad awake.



And Joe had lost an arm--he--that well-made, handsome, gallant 

fellow!  As Dolly glanced towards him, and thought of the pain he 

must have suffered, and the far-off places in which he had been 

wandering, and wondered who had been his nurse, and hoped that 

whoever it was, she had been as kind and gentle and considerate as 

she would have been, the tears came rising to her bright eyes, one 

by one, little by little, until she could keep them back no longer, 

and so before them all, wept bitterly.



'We are all safe now, Dolly,' said her father, kindly.  'We shall 

not be separated any more.  Cheer up, my love, cheer up!'



The locksmith's wife knew better perhaps, than he, what ailed her 

daughter.  But Mrs Varden being quite an altered woman--for the 

riots had done that good--added her word to his, and comforted her 

with similar representations.



'Mayhap,' said Mr Willet, senior, looking round upon the company, 

'she's hungry.  That's what it is, depend upon it--I am, myself.'



The Black Lion, who, like old John, had been waiting supper past 

all reasonable and conscionable hours, hailed this as a 

philosophical discovery of the profoundest and most penetrating 

kind; and the table being already spread, they sat down to supper 

straightway.



The conversation was not of the liveliest nature, nor were the 

appetites of some among them very keen.  But, in both these 

respects, old John more than atoned for any deficiency on the part 

of the rest, and very much distinguished himself.



It was not in point of actual conversation that Mr Willet shone so 

brilliantly, for he had none of his old cronies to 'tackle,' and 

was rather timorous of venturing on Joe; having certain vague 

misgivings within him, that he was ready on the shortest notice, 

and on receipt of the slightest offence, to fell the Black Lion to 

the floor of his own parlour, and immediately to withdraw to China 

or some other remote and unknown region, there to dwell for 

evermore, or at least until he had got rid of his remaining arm and 

both legs, and perhaps an eye or so, into the bargain.  It was with 

a peculiar kind of pantomime that Mr Willet filled up every pause; 

and in this he was considered by the Black Lion, who had been his 

familiar for some years, quite to surpass and go beyond himself, 

and outrun the expectations of his most admiring friends.



The subject that worked in Mr Willet's mind, and occasioned these 

demonstrations, was no other than his son's bodily disfigurement, 

which he had never yet got himself thoroughly to believe, or 

comprehend.  Shortly after their first meeting, he had been 

observed to wander, in a state of great perplexity, to the kitchen, 

and to direct his gaze towards the fire, as if in search of his 

usual adviser in all matters of doubt and difficulty.  But there 

being no boiler at the Black Lion, and the rioters having so beaten 

and battered his own that it was quite unfit for further service, 

he wandered out again, in a perfect bog of uncertainty and mental 

confusion, and in that state took the strangest means of resolving 

his doubts: such as feeling the sleeve of his son's greatcoat as 

deeming it possible that his arm might be there; looking at his own 

arms and those of everybody else, as if to assure himself that two 

and not one was the usual allowance; sitting by the hour together 

in a brown study, as if he were endeavouring to recall Joe's image 

in his younger days, and to remember whether he really had in those 

times one arm or a pair; and employing himself in many other 

speculations of the same kind.



Finding himself at this supper, surrounded by faces with which he 

had been so well acquainted in old times, Mr Willet recurred to the 

subject with uncommon vigour; apparently resolved to understand it 

now or never.  Sometimes, after every two or three mouthfuls, he 

laid down his knife and fork, and stared at his son with all his 

might--particularly at his maimed side; then, he looked slowly 

round the table until he caught some person's eye, when he shook 

his head with great solemnity, patted his shoulder, winked, or as 

one may say--for winking was a very slow process with him--went to 

sleep with one eye for a minute or two; and so, with another solemn 

shaking of his head, took up his knife and fork again, and went on 

eating.  Sometimes, he put his food into his mouth abstractedly, 

and, with all his faculties concentrated on Joe, gazed at him in a 

fit of stupefaction as he cut his meat with one hand, until he was 

recalled to himself by symptoms of choking on his own part, and was 

by that means restored to consciousness.  At other times he 

resorted to such small devices as asking him for the salt, the 

pepper, the vinegar, the mustard--anything that was on his maimed 

side--and watching him as he handed it.  By dint of these 

experiments, he did at last so satisfy and convince himself, that, 

after a longer silence than he had yet maintained, he laid down his 

knife and fork on either side his plate, drank a long draught from 

a tankard beside him (still keeping his eyes on Joe), and leaning 

backward in his chair and fetching a long breath, said, as he 

looked all round the board:



'It's been took off!'



'By George!' said the Black Lion, striking the table with his hand, 

'he's got it!'



'Yes, sir,' said Mr Willet, with the look of a man who felt that he 

had earned a compliment, and deserved it.  'That's where it is.  

It's been took off.'



'Tell him where it was done,' said the Black Lion to Joe.



'At the defence of the Savannah, father.'



'At the defence of the Salwanners,' repeated Mr Willet, softly; 

again looking round the table.



'In America, where the war is,' said Joe.



'In America, where the war is,' repeated Mr Willet.  'It was took 

off in the defence of the Salwanners in America where the war is.'  

Continuing to repeat these words to himself in a low tone of voice 

(the same information had been conveyed to him in the same terms, 

at least fifty times before), Mr Willet arose from table, walked 

round to Joe, felt his empty sleeve all the way up, from the cuff, 

to where the stump of his arm remained; shook his hand; lighted his 

pipe at the fire, took a long whiff, walked to the door, turned 

round once when he had reached it, wiped his left eye with the back 

of his forefinger, and said, in a faltering voice: 'My son's arm--

was took off--at the defence of the--Salwanners--in America--where 

the war is'--with which words he withdrew, and returned no more 

that night.



Indeed, on various pretences, they all withdrew one after another, 

save Dolly, who was left sitting there alone.  It was a great 

relief to be alone, and she was crying to her heart's content, when 

she heard Joe's voice at the end of the passage, bidding somebody 

good night.



Good night!  Then he was going elsewhere--to some distance, 

perhaps.  To what kind of home COULD he be going, now that it was 

so late!



She heard him walk along the passage, and pass the door.  But there 

was a hesitation in his footsteps.  He turned back--Dolly's heart 

beat high--he looked in.



'Good night!'--he didn't say Dolly, but there was comfort in his 

not saying Miss Varden.



'Good night!' sobbed Dolly.



'I am sorry you take on so much, for what is past and gone,' said 

Joe kindly.  'Don't.  I can't bear to see you do it.  Think of it 

no longer.  You are safe and happy now.'



Dolly cried the more.



'You must have suffered very much within these few days--and yet 

you're not changed, unless it's for the better.  They said you 

were, but I don't see it.  You were--you were always very 

beautiful,' said Joe, 'but you are more beautiful than ever, now.  

You are indeed.  There can be no harm in my saying so, for you must 

know it.  You are told so very often, I am sure.'



As a general principle, Dolly DID know it, and WAS told so, very 

often.  But the coachmaker had turned out, years ago, to be a 

special donkey; and whether she had been afraid of making similar 

discoveries in others, or had grown by dint of long custom to be 

careless of compliments generally, certain it is that although she 

cried so much, she was better pleased to be told so now, than ever 

she had been in all her life.



'I shall bless your name,' sobbed the locksmith's little daughter, 

'as long as I live.  I shall never hear it spoken without feeling 

as if my heart would burst.  I shall remember it in my prayers, 

every night and morning till I die!'



'Will you?' said Joe, eagerly.  'Will you indeed?  It makes me--

well, it makes me very glad and proud to hear you say so.'



Dolly still sobbed, and held her handkerchief to her eyes.  Joe 

still stood, looking at her.



'Your voice,' said Joe, 'brings up old times so pleasantly, that, 

for the moment, I feel as if that night--there can be no harm in 

talking of that night now--had come back, and nothing had happened 

in the mean time.  I feel as if I hadn't suffered any hardships, 

but had knocked down poor Tom Cobb only yesterday, and had come to 

see you with my bundle on my shoulder before running away.--You 

remember?'



Remember!  But she said nothing.  She raised her eyes for an 

instant.  It was but a glance; a little, tearful, timid glance.  It 

kept Joe silent though, for a long time.



'Well!' he said stoutly, 'it was to be otherwise, and was.  I have 

been abroad, fighting all the summer and frozen up all the winter, 

ever since.  I have come back as poor in purse as I went, and 

crippled for life besides.  But, Dolly, I would rather have lost 

this other arm--ay, I would rather have lost my head--than have 

come back to find you dead, or anything but what I always pictured 

you to myself, and what I always hoped and wished to find you.  

Thank God for all!'



Oh how much, and how keenly, the little coquette of five years ago, 

felt now!  She had found her heart at last.  Never having known its 

worth till now, she had never known the worth of his.  How 

priceless it appeared!



'I did hope once,' said Joe, in his homely way, 'that I might come 

back a rich man, and marry you.  But I was a boy then, and have 

long known better than that.  I am a poor, maimed, discharged 

soldier, and must be content to rub through life as I can.  I can't 

say, even now, that I shall be glad to see you married, Dolly; but 

I AM glad--yes, I am, and glad to think I can say so--to know that 

you are admired and courted, and can pick and choose for a happy 

life.  It's a comfort to me to know that you'll talk to your 

husband about me; and I hope the time will come when I may be able 


to like him, and to shake hands with him, and to come and see you 

as a poor friend who knew you when you were a girl.  God bless 

you!'



His hand DID tremble; but for all that, he took it away again, and 

left her.
