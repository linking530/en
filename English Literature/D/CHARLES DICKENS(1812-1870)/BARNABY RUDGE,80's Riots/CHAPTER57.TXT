Barnaby, armed as we have seen, continued to pace up and down 

before the stable-door; glad to be alone again, and heartily 

rejoicing in the unaccustomed silence and tranquillity.  After the 

whirl of noise and riot in which the last two days had been passed, 

the pleasures of solitude and peace were enhanced a thousandfold.  

He felt quite happy; and as he leaned upon his staff and mused, a 

bright smile overspread his face, and none but cheerful visions 

floated into his brain.



Had he no thoughts of her, whose sole delight he was, and whom he 

had unconsciously plunged in such bitter sorrow and such deep 

affliction?  Oh, yes.  She was at the heart of all his cheerful 

hopes and proud reflections.  It was she whom all this honour and 

distinction were to gladden; the joy and profit were for her.  What 

delight it gave her to hear of the bravery of her poor boy!  Ah!  

He would have known that, without Hugh's telling him.  And what a 

precious thing it was to know she lived so happily, and heard with 

so much pride (he pictured to himself her look when they told her) 

that he was in such high esteem: bold among the boldest, and 

trusted before them all!  And when these frays were over, and the 

good lord had conquered his enemies, and they were all at peace 

again, and he and she were rich, what happiness they would have in 

talking of these troubled times when he was a great soldier: and 

when they sat alone together in the tranquil twilight, and she had 

no longer reason to be anxious for the morrow, what pleasure would 

he have in the reflection that this was his doing--his--poor 

foolish Barnaby's; and in patting her on the cheek, and saying with 

a merry laugh, 'Am I silly now, mother--am I silly now?'



With a lighter heart and step, and eyes the brighter for the happy 

tear that dimmed them for a moment, Barnaby resumed his walk; and 

singing gaily to himself, kept guard upon his quiet post.



His comrade Grip, the partner of his watch, though fond of basking 

in the sunshine, preferred to-day to walk about the stable; having 

a great deal to do in the way of scattering the straw, hiding under 

it such small articles as had been casually left about, and 

haunting Hugh's bed, to which he seemed to have taken a particular 

attachment.  Sometimes Barnaby looked in and called him, and then 

he came hopping out; but he merely did this as a concession to his 

master's weakness, and soon returned again to his own grave 

pursuits: peering into the straw with his bill, and rapidly 

covering up the place, as if, Midas-like, he were whispering 

secrets to the earth and burying them; constantly busying himself 

upon the sly; and affecting, whenever Barnaby came past, to look up 

in the clouds and have nothing whatever on his mind: in short, 

conducting himself, in many respects, in a more than usually 

thoughtful, deep, and mysterious manner.



As the day crept on, Barnaby, who had no directions forbidding him 

to eat and drink upon his post, but had been, on the contrary, 

supplied with a bottle of beer and a basket of provisions, 

determined to break his fast, which he had not done since morning.  

To this end, he sat down on the ground before the door, and putting 

his staff across his knees in case of alarm or surprise, summoned 

Grip to dinner.



This call, the bird obeyed with great alacrity; crying, as he 

sidled up to his master, 'I'm a devil, I'm a Polly, I'm a kettle, 

I'm a Protestant, No Popery!'  Having learnt this latter sentiment 

from the gentry among whom he had lived of late, he delivered it 

with uncommon emphasis.



'Well said, Grip!' cried his master, as he fed him with the 

daintiest bits.  'Well said, old boy!'



'Never say die, bow wow wow, keep up your spirits, Grip Grip Grip, 

Holloa!  We'll all have tea, I'm a Protestant kettle, No Popery!' 

cried the raven.



'Gordon for ever, Grip!' cried Barnaby.



The raven, placing his head upon the ground, looked at his master 

sideways, as though he would have said, 'Say that again!'  

Perfectly understanding his desire, Barnaby repeated the phrase a 

great many times.  The bird listened with profound attention; 

sometimes repeating the popular cry in a low voice, as if to 

compare the two, and try if it would at all help him to this new 

accomplishment; sometimes flapping his wings, or barking; and 

sometimes in a kind of desperation drawing a multitude of corks, 

with extraordinary viciousness.



Barnaby was so intent upon his favourite, that he was not at first 

aware of the approach of two persons on horseback, who were riding 

at a foot-pace, and coming straight towards his post.  When he 

perceived them, however, which he did when they were within some 

fifty yards of him, he jumped hastily up, and ordering Grip within 

doors, stood with both hands on his staff, waiting until he should 

know whether they were friends or foes.



He had hardly done so, when he observed that those who advanced 

were a gentleman and his servant; almost at the same moment he 

recognised Lord George Gordon, before whom he stood uncovered, with 

his eyes turned towards the ground.



'Good day!' said Lord George, not reining in his horse until he was 

close beside him.  'Well!'



'All quiet, sir, all safe!' cried Barnaby.  'The rest are away--

they went by that path--that one.  A grand party!'



'Ay?' said Lord George, looking thoughtfully at him.  'And you?'



'Oh!  They left me here to watch--to mount guard--to keep 

everything secure till they come back.  I'll do it, sir, for your 

sake.  You're a good gentleman; a kind gentleman--ay, you are.  

There are many against you, but we'll be a match for them, never 

fear!'



'What's that?' said Lord George--pointing to the raven who was 

peeping out of the stable-door--but still looking thoughtfully, and 

in some perplexity, it seemed, at Barnaby.



'Why, don't you know!' retorted Barnaby, with a wondering laugh.  

'Not know what HE is!  A bird, to be sure.  My bird--my friend--

Grip.'



'A devil, a kettle, a Grip, a Polly, a Protestant, no Popery!' 

cried the raven.



'Though, indeed,' added Barnaby, laying his hand upon the neck of 

Lord George's horse, and speaking softly: 'you had good reason to 

ask me what he is, for sometimes it puzzles me--and I am used to 

him--to think he's only a bird.  He's my brother, Grip is--always 

with me--always talking--always merry--eh, Grip?'



The raven answered by an affectionate croak, and hopping on his 

master's arm, which he held downward for that purpose, submitted 

with an air of perfect indifference to be fondled, and turned his 

restless, curious eye, now upon Lord George, and now upon his man.



Lord George, biting his nails in a discomfited manner, regarded 

Barnaby for some time in silence; then beckoning to his servant, 

said:



'Come hither, John.'



John Grueby touched his hat, and came.



'Have you ever seen this young man before?' his master asked in a 

low voice.



'Twice, my lord,' said John.  'I saw him in the crowd last night 

and Saturday.'



'Did--did it seem to you that his manner was at all wild or 

strange?' Lord George demanded, faltering.



'Mad,' said John, with emphatic brevity.



'And why do you think him mad, sir?' said his master, speaking in a 

peevish tone.  'Don't use that word too freely.  Why do you think 

him mad?'



'My lord,' John Grueby answered, 'look at his dress, look at his 

eyes, look at his restless way, hear him cry "No Popery!"  Mad, my 

lord.'



'So because one man dresses unlike another,' returned his angry 

master, glancing at himself; 'and happens to differ from other men 

in his carriage and manner, and to advocate a great cause which the 

corrupt and irreligious desert, he is to be accounted mad, is he?'



'Stark, staring, raving, roaring mad, my lord,' returned the 

unmoved John.



'Do you say this to my face?' cried his master, turning sharply 

upon him.



'To any man, my lord, who asks me,' answered John.



'Mr Gashford, I find, was right,' said Lord George; 'I thought him 

prejudiced, though I ought to have known a man like him better than 

to have supposed it possible!'



'I shall never have Mr Gashford's good word, my lord,' replied 

John, touching his hat respectfully, 'and I don't covet it.'



'You are an ill-conditioned, most ungrateful fellow,' said Lord 

George: 'a spy, for anything I know.  Mr Gashford is perfectly 

correct, as I might have felt convinced he was.  I have done wrong 

to retain you in my service.  It is a tacit insult to him as my 

choice and confidential friend to do so, remembering the cause you 

sided with, on the day he was maligned at Westminster.  You will 

leave me to-night--nay, as soon as we reach home.  The sooner the 

better.'



'If it comes to that, I say so too, my lord.  Let Mr Gashford have 

his will.  As to my being a spy, my lord, you know me better than 

to believe it, I am sure.  I don't know much about causes.  My 

cause is the cause of one man against two hundred; and I hope it 

always will be.'



'You have said quite enough,' returned Lord George, motioning him 

to go back.  'I desire to hear no more.'



'If you'll let me have another word, my lord,' returned John 

Grueby, 'I'd give this silly fellow a caution not to stay here by 

himself.  The proclamation is in a good many hands already, and 

it's well known that he was concerned in the business it relates 

to.  He had better get to a place of safety if he can, poor 

creature.'



'You hear what this man says?' cried Lord George, addressing 

Barnaby, who had looked on and wondered while this dialogue passed.  

'He thinks you may be afraid to remain upon your post, and are kept 

here perhaps against your will.  What do you say?'



'I think, young man,' said John, in explanation, 'that the soldiers 

may turn out and take you; and that if they do, you will certainly 

be hung by the neck till you're dead--dead--dead.  And I think you 

had better go from here, as fast as you can.  That's what I think.'



'He's a coward, Grip, a coward!' cried Barnaby, putting the raven 

on the ground, and shouldering his staff.  'Let them come!  Gordon 

for ever!  Let them come!'



'Ay!' said Lord George, 'let them!  Let us see who will venture to 

attack a power like ours; the solemn league of a whole people.  

THIS a madman!  You have said well, very well.  I am proud to be 

the leader of such men as you.'



Bamaby's heart swelled within his bosom as he heard these words.  

He took Lord George's hand and carried it to his lips; patted his 

horse's crest, as if the affection and admiration he had conceived 

for the man extended to the animal he rode; then unfurling his 

flag, and proudly waving it, resumed his pacing up and down.



Lord George, with a kindling eye and glowing cheek, took off his 

hat, and flourishing it above his head, bade him exultingly 

Farewell!--then cantered off at a brisk pace; after glancing 

angrily round to see that his servant followed.  Honest John set 

spurs to his horse and rode after his master, but not before he had 

again warned Barnaby to retreat, with many significant gestures, 

which indeed he continued to make, and Barnaby to resist, until the 

windings of the road concealed them from each other's view.



Left to himself again with a still higher sense of the importance 

of his post, and stimulated to enthusiasm by the special notice and 

encouragement of his leader, Barnaby walked to and fro in a 

delicious trance rather than as a waking man.  The sunshine which 

prevailed around was in his mind.  He had but one desire 

ungratified.  If she could only see him now!



The day wore on; its heat was gently giving place to the cool of 

evening; a light wind sprung up, fanning his long hair, and making 

the banner rustle pleasantly above his head.  There was a freedom 

and freshness in the sound and in the time, which chimed exactly 

with his mood.  He was happier than ever.



He was leaning on his staff looking towards the declining sun, and 

reflecting with a smile that he stood sentinel at that moment over 

buried gold, when two or three figures appeared in the distance, 

making towards the house at a rapid pace, and motioning with their 

hands as though they urged its inmates to retreat from some 

approaching danger.  As they drew nearer, they became more earnest 

in their gestures; and they were no sooner within hearing, than the 

foremost among them cried that the soldiers were coming up.



At these words, Barnaby furled his flag, and tied it round the 

pole.  His heart beat high while he did so, but he had no more fear 

or thought of retreating than the pole itself.  The friendly 

stragglers hurried past him, after giving him notice of his danger, 

and quickly passed into the house, where the utmost confusion 

immediately prevailed.  As those within hastily closed the windows 

and the doors, they urged him by looks and signs to fly without 

loss of time, and called to him many times to do so; but he only 

shook his head indignantly in answer, and stood the firmer on his 

post.  Finding that he was not to be persuaded, they took care of 

themselves; and leaving the place with only one old woman in it, 

speedily withdrew.



As yet there had been no symptom of the news having any better 

foundation than in the fears of those who brought it, but The Boot 

had not been deserted five minutes, when there appeared, coming 

across the fields, a body of men who, it was easy to see, by the 

glitter of their arms and ornaments in the sun, and by their 

orderly and regular mode of advancing--for they came on as one 

man--were soldiers.  In a very little time, Barnaby knew that they 

were a strong detachment of the Foot Guards, having along with them 

two gentlemen in private clothes, and a small party of Horse; the 

latter brought up the rear, and were not in number more than six or 

eight.



They advanced steadily; neither quickening their pace as they came 

nearer, nor raising any cry, nor showing the least emotion or 

anxiety.  Though this was a matter of course in the case of regular 

troops, even to Barnaby, there was something particularly 

impressive and disconcerting in it to one accustomed to the noise 

and tumult of an undisciplined mob.  For all that, he stood his 

ground not a whit the less resolutely, and looked on undismayed.



Presently, they marched into the yard, and halted.  The 

commanding-officer despatched a messenger to the horsemen, one of 

whom came riding back.  Some words passed between them, and they 

glanced at Barnaby; who well remembered the man he had unhorsed at 

Westminster, and saw him now before his eyes.  The man being 

speedily dismissed, saluted, and rode back to his comrades, who 

were drawn up apart at a short distance.



The officer then gave the word to prime and load.  The heavy 

ringing of the musket-stocks upon the ground, and the sharp and 

rapid rattling of the ramrods in their barrels, were a kind of 

relief to Batnahy, deadly though he knew the purport of such sounds 

to be.  When this was done, other commands were given, and the 

soldiers instantaneously formed in single file all round the house 

and stables; completely encircling them in every part, at a 

distance, perhaps, of some half-dozen yards; at least that seemed 

in Barnaby's eyes to be about the space left between himself and 

those who confronted him.  The horsemen remained drawn up by 

themselves as before.



The two gentlemen in private clothes who had kept aloof, now rode 

forward, one on either side the officer.  The proclamation having 

been produced and read by one of them, the officer called on 

Barnaby to surrender.



He made no answer, but stepping within the door, before which he 

had kept guard, held his pole crosswise to protect it.  In the 

midst of a profound silence, he was again called upon to yield.



Still he offered no reply.  Indeed he had enough to do, to run his 

eye backward and forward along the half-dozen men who immediately 

fronted him, and settle hurriedly within himself at which of them 

he would strike first, when they pressed on him.  He caught the eye 

of one in the centre, and resolved to hew that fellow down, though 

he died for it.



Again there was a dead silence, and again the same voice called 

upon him to deliver himself up.



Next moment he was back in the stable, dealing blows about him like 

a madman.  Two of the men lay stretched at his feet: the one he 

had marked, dropped first--he had a thought for that, even in the 

hot blood and hurry of the struggle.  Another blow--another!  Down, 

mastered, wounded in the breast by a heavy blow from the butt-end 

of a gun (he saw the weapon in the act of falling)--breathless--and 

a prisoner.



An exclamation of surprise from the officer recalled him, in some 

degree, to himself.  He looked round.  Grip, after working in 

secret all the afternoon, and with redoubled vigour while 

everybody's attention was distracted, had plucked away the straw 

from Hugh's bed, and turned up the loose ground with his iron bill.  

The hole had been recklessly filled to the brim, and was merely 

sprinkled with earth.  Golden cups, spoons, candlesticks, coined 

guineas--all the riches were revealed.



They brought spades and a sack; dug up everything that was hidden 

there; and carried away more than two men could lift.  They 

handcuffed him and bound his arms, searched him, and took away all 

he had.  Nobody questioned or reproached him, or seemed to have 

much curiosity about him.  The two men he had stunned, were carried 

off by their companions in the same business-like way in which 

everything else was done.  Finally, he was left under a guard of 

four soldiers with fixed bayonets, while the officer directed in 

person the search of the house and the other buildings connected 

with it.



This was soon completed.  The soldiers formed again in the yard; he 

was marched out, with his guard about him; and ordered to fall in, 

where a space was left.  The others closed up all round, and so 

they moved away, with the prisoner in the centre.



When they came into the streets, he felt he was a sight; and 

looking up as they passed quickly along, could see people running 

to the windows a little too late, and throwing up the sashes to 

look after him.  Sometimes he met a staring face beyond the heads 

about him, or under the arms of his conductors, or peering down 

upon him from a waggon-top or coach-box; but this was all he saw, 

being surrounded by so many men.  The very noises of the streets 

seemed muffled and subdued; and the air came stale and hot upon 

him, like the sickly breath of an oven.



Tramp, tramp.  Tramp, tramp.  Heads erect, shoulders square, every 

man stepping in exact time--all so orderly and regular--nobody 

looking at him--nobody seeming conscious of his presence,--he could 

hardly believe he was a Prisoner.  But at the word, though only 

thought, not spoken, he felt the handcuffs galling his wrists, the 

cord pressing his arms to his sides: the loaded guns levelled at 

his head; and those cold, bright, sharp, shining points turned 

towards him: the mere looking down at which, now that he was bound 

and helpless, made the warm current of his life run cold.
