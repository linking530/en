Mr Haredale stood in the widow's parlour with the door-key in his 

hand, gazing by turns at Mr Chester and at Gabriel Varden, and 

occasionally glancing downward at the key as in the hope that of 

its own accord it would unlock the mystery; until Mr Chester, 

putting on his hat and gloves, and sweetly inquiring whether they 

were walking in the same direction, recalled him to himself.



'No,' he said.  'Our roads diverge--widely, as you know.  For the 

present, I shall remain here.'



'You will be hipped, Haredale; you will be miserable, melancholy, 

utterly wretched,' returned the other.  'It's a place of the very 

last description for a man of your temper.  I know it will make you 

very miserable.'



'Let it,' said Mr Haredale, sitting down; 'and thrive upon the 

thought.  Good night!'



Feigning to be wholly unconscious of the abrupt wave of the hand 

which rendered this farewell tantamount to a dismissal, Mr Chester 

retorted with a bland and heartfelt benediction, and inquired of 

Gabriel in what direction HE was going.



'Yours, sir, would be too much honour for the like of me,' replied 

the locksmith, hesitating.



'I wish you to remain here a little while, Varden,' said Mr 

Haredale, without looking towards them.  'I have a word or two to 

say to you.'



'I will not intrude upon your conference another moment,' said Mr 

Chester with inconceivable politeness.  'May it be satisfactory to 

you both!  God bless you!'  So saying, and bestowing upon the 

locksmith a most refulgent smile, he left them.



'A deplorably constituted creature, that rugged person,' he said, 

as he walked along the street; 'he is an atrocity that carries its 

own punishment along with it--a bear that gnaws himself.  And here 

is one of the inestimable advantages of having a perfect command 

over one's inclinations.  I have been tempted in these two short 

interviews, to draw upon that fellow, fifty times.  Five men in six 

would have yielded to the impulse.  By suppressing mine, I wound 

him deeper and more keenly than if I were the best swordsman in all 

Europe, and he the worst.  You are the wise man's very last 

resource,' he said, tapping the hilt of his weapon; 'we can but 

appeal to you when all else is said and done.  To come to you 

before, and thereby spare our adversaries so much, is a barbarian 

mode of warfare, quite unworthy of any man with the remotest 

pretensions to delicacy of feeling, or refinement.'



He smiled so very pleasantly as he communed with himself after this 

manner, that a beggar was emboldened to follow for alms, and to dog 

his footsteps for some distance.  He was gratified by the 

circumstance, feeling it complimentary to his power of feature, and 

as a reward suffered the man to follow him until he called a chair, 

when he graciously dismissed him with a fervent blessing.



'Which is as easy as cursing,' he wisely added, as he took his 

seat, 'and more becoming to the face.--To Clerkenwell, my good 

creatures, if you please!'  The chairmen were rendered quite 

vivacious by having such a courteous burden, and to Clerkenwell 

they went at a fair round trot.



Alighting at a certain point he had indicated to them upon the 

road, and paying them something less than they expected from a fare 

of such gentle speech, he turned into the street in which the 

locksmith dwelt, and presently stood beneath the shadow of the 

Golden Key.  Mr Tappertit, who was hard at work by lamplight, in a 

corner of the workshop, remained unconscious of his presence until 

a hand upon his shoulder made him start and turn his head.



'Industry,' said Mr Chester, 'is the soul of business, and the 

keystone of prosperity.  Mr Tappertit, I shall expect you to invite 

me to dinner when you are Lord Mayor of London.'



'Sir,' returned the 'prentice, laying down his hammer, and rubbing 

his nose on the back of a very sooty hand, 'I scorn the Lord Mayor 

and everything that belongs to him.  We must have another state of 

society, sir, before you catch me being Lord Mayor.  How de do, sir?'



'The better, Mr Tappertit, for looking into your ingenuous face 

once more.  I hope you are well.'



'I am as well, sir,' said Sim, standing up to get nearer to his 

ear, and whispering hoarsely, 'as any man can be under the 

aggrawations to which I am exposed.  My life's a burden to me.  If 

it wasn't for wengeance, I'd play at pitch and toss with it on the 

losing hazard.'



'Is Mrs Varden at home?' said Mr Chester.



'Sir,' returned Sim, eyeing him over with a look of concentrated 

expression,--'she is.  Did you wish to see her?'



Mr Chester nodded.



'Then come this way, sir,' said Sim, wiping his face upon his 

apron.  'Follow me, sir.--Would you permit me to whisper in your 

ear, one half a second?'



'By all means.'



Mr Tappertit raised himself on tiptoe, applied his lips to Mr 

Chester's ear, drew back his head without saying anything, looked 

hard at him, applied them to his ear again, again drew back, and 

finally whispered--'The name is Joseph Willet.  Hush!  I say no 

more.'



Having said that much, he beckoned the visitor with a mysterious 

aspect to follow him to the parlour-door, where he announced him 

in the voice of a gentleman-usher.  'Mr Chester.'



'And not Mr Ed'dard, mind,' said Sim, looking into the door again, 

and adding this by way of postscript in his own person; 'it's his 

father.'



'But do not let his father,' said Mr Chester, advancing hat in 

hand, as he observed the effect of this last explanatory 

announcement, 'do not let his father be any check or restraint on 

your domestic occupations, Miss Varden.'



'Oh!  Now!  There!  An't I always a-saying it!' exclaimed Miggs, 

clapping her hands.  'If he an't been and took Missis for her own 

daughter.  Well, she DO look like it, that she do.  Only think of 

that, mim!'



'Is it possible,' said Mr Chester in his softest tones, 'that this 

is Mrs Varden!  I am amazed.  That is not your daughter, Mrs 

Varden?  No, no.  Your sister.'



'My daughter, indeed, sir,' returned Mrs V., blushing with great 

juvenility.



'Ah, Mrs Varden!' cried the visitor.  'Ah, ma'am--humanity is 

indeed a happy lot, when we can repeat ourselves in others, and 

still be young as they.  You must allow me to salute you--the 

custom of the country, my dear madam--your daughter too.'



Dolly showed some reluctance to perform this ceremony, but was 

sharply reproved by Mrs Varden, who insisted on her undergoing it 

that minute.  For pride, she said with great severity, was one of 

the seven deadly sins, and humility and lowliness of heart were 

virtues.  Wherefore she desired that Dolly would be kissed 

immediately, on pain of her just displeasure; at the same time 

giving her to understand that whatever she saw her mother do, she 

might safely do herself, without being at the trouble of any 

reasoning or reflection on the subject--which, indeed, was 

offensive and undutiful, and in direct contravention of the church 

catechism.



Thus admonished, Dolly complied, though by no means willingly; for 

there was a broad, bold look of admiration in Mr Chester's face, 

refined and polished though it sought to be, which distressed her 

very much.  As she stood with downcast eyes, not liking to look up 

and meet his, he gazed upon her with an approving air, and then 

turned to her mother.



'My friend Gabriel (whose acquaintance I only made this very 

evening) should be a happy man, Mrs Varden.'



'Ah!' sighed Mrs V., shaking her head.



'Ah!' echoed Miggs.



'Is that the case?' said Mr Chester, compassionately.  'Dear me!'



'Master has no intentions, sir,' murmured Miggs as she sidled up 

to him, 'but to be as grateful as his natur will let him, for 

everythink he owns which it is in his powers to appreciate.  But we 

never, sir'--said Miggs, looking sideways at Mrs Varden, and 

interlarding her discourse with a sigh--'we never know the full 

value of SOME wines and fig-trees till we lose 'em.  So much the 

worse, sir, for them as has the slighting of 'em on their 

consciences when they're gone to be in full blow elsewhere.'  And 

Miss Miggs cast up her eyes to signify where that might be.



As Mrs Varden distinctly heard, and was intended to hear, all that 

Miggs said, and as these words appeared to convey in metaphorical 

terms a presage or foreboding that she would at some early period 

droop beneath her trials and take an easy flight towards the stars, 

she immediately began to languish, and taking a volume of the 

Manual from a neighbouring table, leant her arm upon it as though 

she were Hope and that her Anchor.  Mr Chester perceiving this, 

and seeing how the volume was lettered on the back, took it gently 

from her hand, and turned the fluttering leaves.



'My favourite book, dear madam.  How often, how very often in his 

early life--before he can remember'--(this clause was strictly 

true) 'have I deduced little easy moral lessons from its pages, for 

my dear son Ned!  You know Ned?'



Mrs Varden had that honour, and a fine affable young gentleman he 

was.



'You're a mother, Mrs Varden,' said Mr Chester, taking a pinch of 

snuff, 'and you know what I, as a father, feel, when he is praised.  

He gives me some uneasiness--much uneasiness--he's of a roving 

nature, ma'am--from flower to flower--from sweet to sweet--but his 

is the butterfly time of life, and we must not be hard upon such 

trifling.'



He glanced at Dolly.  She was attending evidently to what he said.  

Just what he desired!



'The only thing I object to in this little trait of Ned's, is,' 

said Mr Chester, '--and the mention of his name reminds me, by the 

way, that I am about to beg the favour of a minute's talk with you 

alone--the only thing I object to in it, is, that it DOES partake 

of insincerity.  Now, however I may attempt to disguise the fact 

from myself in my affection for Ned, still I always revert to this--

that if we are not sincere, we are nothing.  Nothing upon earth.  

Let us be sincere, my dear madam--'



'--and Protestant,' murmured Mrs Varden.



'--and Protestant above all things.  Let us be sincere and 

Protestant, strictly moral, strictly just (though always with a 

leaning towards mercy), strictly honest, and strictly true, and we 

gain--it is a slight point, certainly, but still it is something 

tangible; we throw up a groundwork and foundation, so to speak, of 

goodness, on which we may afterwards erect some worthy 

superstructure.'



Now, to be sure, Mrs Varden thought, here is a perfect character.  

Here is a meek, righteous, thoroughgoing Christian, who, having 

mastered all these qualities, so difficult of attainment; who, 

having dropped a pinch of salt on the tails of all the cardinal 

virtues, and caught them every one; makes light of their 

possession, and pants for more morality.  For the good woman never 

doubted (as many good men and women never do), that this slighting 

kind of profession, this setting so little store by great matters, 

this seeming to say, 'I am not proud, I am what you hear, but I 

consider myself no better than other people; let us change the 

subject, pray'--was perfectly genuine and true.  He so contrived 

it, and said it in that way that it appeared to have been forced 

from him, and its effect was marvellous.



Aware of the impression he had made--few men were quicker than he 

at such discoveries--Mr Chester followed up the blow by propounding 

certain virtuous maxims, somewhat vague and general in their 

nature, doubtless, and occasionally partaking of the character of 

truisms, worn a little out at elbow, but delivered in so charming a 

voice and with such uncommon serenity and peace of mind, that they 

answered as well as the best.  Nor is this to be wondered at; for 

as hollow vessels produce a far more musical sound in falling than 

those which are substantial, so it will oftentimes be found that 

sentiments which have nothing in them make the loudest ringing in 

the world, and are the most relished.



Mr Chester, with the volume gently extended in one hand, and with 

the other planted lightly on his breast, talked to them in the most 

delicious manner possible; and quite enchanted all his hearers, 

notwithstanding their conflicting interests and thoughts.  Even 

Dolly, who, between his keen regards and her eyeing over by Mr 

Tappertit, was put quite out of countenance, could not help owning 

within herself that he was the sweetest-spoken gentleman she had 

ever seen.  Even Miss Miggs, who was divided between admiration of 

Mr Chester and a mortal jealousy of her young mistress, had 

sufficient leisure to be propitiated.  Even Mr Tappertit, though 

occupied as we have seen in gazing at his heart's delight, could 

not wholly divert his thoughts from the voice of the other charmer.  

Mrs Varden, to her own private thinking, had never been so improved 

in all her life; and when Mr Chester, rising and craving permission 

to speak with her apart, took her by the hand and led her at arm's 

length upstairs to the best sitting-room, she almost deemed him 

something more than human.



'Dear madam,' he said, pressing her hand delicately to his lips; 

'be seated.'



Mrs Varden called up quite a courtly air, and became seated.



'You guess my object?' said Mr Chester, drawing a chair towards 

her.  'You divine my purpose?  I am an affectionate parent, my dear 

Mrs Varden.'



'That I am sure you are, sir,' said Mrs V.



'Thank you,' returned Mr Chester, tapping his snuff-box lid.  

'Heavy moral responsibilities rest with parents, Mrs Varden.'



Mrs Varden slightly raised her hands, shook her head, and looked at 

the ground as though she saw straight through the globe, out at the 

other end, and into the immensity of space beyond.



'I may confide in you,' said Mr Chester, 'without reserve.  I love 

my son, ma'am, dearly; and loving him as I do, I would save him 

from working certain misery.  You know of his attachment to Miss 

Haredale.  You have abetted him in it, and very kind of you it was 

to do so.  I am deeply obliged to you--most deeply obliged to you--

for your interest in his behalf; but my dear ma'am, it is a 

mistaken one, I do assure you.'



Mrs Varden stammered that she was sorry--'



'Sorry, my dear ma'am,' he interposed.  'Never be sorry for what is 

so very amiable, so very good in intention, so perfectly like 

yourself.  But there are grave and weighty reasons, pressing family 

considerations, and apart even from these, points of religious 

difference, which interpose themselves, and render their union 

impossible; utterly im-possible.  I should have mentioned these 

circumstances to your husband; but he has--you will excuse my 

saying this so freely--he has NOT your quickness of apprehension or 

depth of moral sense.  What an extremely airy house this is, and 

how beautifully kept!  For one like myself--a widower so long--

these tokens of female care and superintendence have inexpressible 

charms.'



Mrs Varden began to think (she scarcely knew why) that the young Mr 

Chester must be in the wrong and the old Mr Chester must he in the 

right.



'My son Ned,' resumed her tempter with his most winning air, 'has 

had, I am told, your lovely daughter's aid, and your open-hearted 

husband's.'



'--Much more than mine, sir,' said Mrs Varden; 'a great deal more.  

I have often had my doubts.  It's a--'



'A bad example,' suggested Mr Chester.  'It is.  No doubt it is.  

Your daughter is at that age when to set before her an 

encouragement for young persons to rebel against their parents on 

this most important point, is particularly injudicious.  You are 

quite right.  I ought to have thought of that myself, but it 

escaped me, I confess--so far superior are your sex to ours, dear 

madam, in point of penetration and sagacity.'



Mrs Varden looked as wise as if she had really said something to 

deserve this compliment--firmly believed she had, in short--and her 

faith in her own shrewdness increased considerably.



'My dear ma'am,' said Mr Chester, 'you embolden me to be plain 

with you.  My son and I are at variance on this point.  The young 

lady and her natural guardian differ upon it, also.  And the 

closing point is, that my son is bound by his duty to me, by his 

honour, by every solemn tie and obligation, to marry some one 

else.'



'Engaged to marry another lady!' quoth Mrs Varden, holding up her 

hands.



'My dear madam, brought up, educated, and trained, expressly for 

that purpose.  Expressly for that purpose.--Miss Haredale, I am 

told, is a very charming creature.'



'I am her foster-mother, and should know--the best young lady in 

the world,' said Mrs Varden.



'I have not the smallest doubt of it.  I am sure she is.  And you, 

who have stood in that tender relation towards her, are bound to 

consult her happiness.  Now, can I--as I have said to Haredale, who 

quite agrees--can I possibly stand by, and suffer her to throw 

herself away (although she IS of a Catholic family), upon a young 

fellow who, as yet, has no heart at all?  It is no imputation upon 

him to say he has not, because young men who have plunged deeply 

into the frivolities and conventionalities of society, very seldom 

have.  Their hearts never grow, my dear ma'am, till after thirty.  

I don't believe, no, I do NOT believe, that I had any heart myself 

when I was Ned's age.'



'Oh sir,' said Mrs Varden, 'I think you must have had.  It's 

impossible that you, who have so much now, can ever have been 

without any.'



'I hope,' he answered, shrugging his shoulders meekly, 'I have a 

little; I hope, a very little--Heaven knows!  But to return to Ned; 

I have no doubt you thought, and therefore interfered benevolently 

in his behalf, that I objected to Miss Haredale.  How very 

natural!  My dear madam, I object to him--to him--emphatically to 

Ned himself.'



Mrs Varden was perfectly aghast at the disclosure.



'He has, if he honourably fulfils this solemn obligation of which I 

have told you--and he must be honourable, dear Mrs Varden, or he is 

no son of mine--a fortune within his reach.  He is of most 

expensive, ruinously expensive habits; and if, in a moment of 

caprice and wilfulness, he were to marry this young lady, and so 

deprive himself of the means of gratifying the tastes to which he 

has been so long accustomed, he would--my dear madam, he would 

break the gentle creature's heart.  Mrs Varden, my good lady, my 

dear soul, I put it to you--is such a sacrifice to be endured?  Is 

the female heart a thing to be trifled with in this way?  Ask your 

own, my dear madam.  Ask your own, I beseech you.'



'Truly,' thought Mrs Varden, 'this gentleman is a saint.  But,' she 

added aloud, and not unnaturally, 'if you take Miss Emma's lover 

away, sir, what becomes of the poor thing's heart then?'



'The very point,' said Mr Chester, not at all abashed, 'to which I 

wished to lead you.  A marriage with my son, whom I should be 

compelled to disown, would be followed by years of misery; they 

would be separated, my dear madam, in a twelvemonth.  To break off 

this attachment, which is more fancied than real, as you and I know 

very well, will cost the dear girl but a few tears, and she is 

happy again.  Take the case of your own daughter, the young lady 

downstairs, who is your breathing image'--Mrs Varden coughed and 

simpered--'there is a young man (I am sorry to say, a dissolute 

fellow, of very indifferent character) of whom I have heard Ned 

speak--Bullet was it--Pullet--Mullet--'



'There is a young man of the name of Joseph Willet, sir,' said Mrs 

Varden, folding her hands loftily.



'That's he,' cried Mr Chester.  'Suppose this Joseph Willet now, 

were to aspire to the affections of your charming daughter, and 

were to engage them.'



'It would be like his impudence,' interposed Mrs Varden, bridling, 

'to dare to think of such a thing!'



'My dear madam, that's the whole case.  I know it would be like his 

impudence.  It is like Ned's impudence to do as he has done; but 

you would not on that account, or because of a few tears from your 

beautiful daughter, refrain from checking their inclinations in 

their birth.  I meant to have reasoned thus with your husband when 

I saw him at Mrs Rudge's this evening--'



'My husband,' said Mrs Varden, interposing with emotion, 'would be 

a great deal better at home than going to Mrs Rudge's so often.  I 

don't know what he does there.  I don't see what occasion he has to 

busy himself in her affairs at all, sir.'



'If I don't appear to express my concurrence in those last 

sentiments of yours,' returned Mr Chester, 'quite so strongly as 

you might desire, it is because his being there, my dear madam, and 

not proving conversational, led me hither, and procured me the 

happiness of this interview with one, in whom the whole management, 

conduct, and prosperity of her family are centred, I perceive.'



With that he took Mrs Varden's hand again, and having pressed it to 

his lips with the highflown gallantry of the day--a little 

burlesqued to render it the more striking in the good lady's 

unaccustomed eyes--proceeded in the same strain of mingled 

sophistry, cajolery, and flattery, to entreat that her utmost 

influence might be exerted to restrain her husband and daughter 

from any further promotion of Edward's suit to Miss Haredale, and 

from aiding or abetting either party in any way.  Mrs Varden was 

but a woman, and had her share of vanity, obstinacy, and love of 

power.  She entered into a secret treaty of alliance, offensive and 

defensive, with her insinuating visitor; and really did believe, as 

many others would have done who saw and heard him, that in so doing 

she furthered the ends of truth, justice, and morality, in a very 

uncommon degree.



Overjoyed by the success of his negotiation, and mightily amused 

within himself, Mr Chester conducted her downstairs in the same 

state as before; and having repeated the previous ceremony of 

salutation, which also as before comprehended Dolly, took his 

leave; first completing the conquest of Miss Miggs's heart, by 

inquiring if 'this young lady' would light him to the door.



'Oh, mim,' said Miggs, returning with the candle.  'Oh gracious me, 

mim, there's a gentleman!  Was there ever such an angel to talk as 

he is--and such a sweet-looking man!  So upright and noble, that he 

seems to despise the very ground he walks on; and yet so mild and 

condescending, that he seems to say "but I will take notice on it 

too."  And to think of his taking you for Miss Dolly, and Miss 

Dolly for your sister--Oh, my goodness me, if I was master wouldn't 

I be jealous of him!'



Mrs Varden reproved her handmaid for this vain-speaking; but very 

gently and mildly--quite smilingly indeed--remarking that she was a 

foolish, giddy, light-headed girl, whose spirits carried her 

beyond all bounds, and who didn't mean half she said, or she would 

be quite angry with her.



'For my part,' said Dolly, in a thoughtful manner, 'I half believe 

Mr Chester is something like Miggs in that respect.  For all his 

politeness and pleasant speaking, I am pretty sure he was making 

game of us, more than once.'



'If you venture to say such a thing again, and to speak ill of 

people behind their backs in my presence, miss,' said Mrs Varden, 

'I shall insist upon your taking a candle and going to bed 

directly.  How dare you, Dolly?  I'm astonished at you.  The 

rudeness of your whole behaviour this evening has been disgraceful.  

Did anybody ever hear,' cried the enraged matron, bursting into 

tears, 'of a daughter telling her own mother she has been made game 

of!'



What a very uncertain temper Mrs Varden's was!
