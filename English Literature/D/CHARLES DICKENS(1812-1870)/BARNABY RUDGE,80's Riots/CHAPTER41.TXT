From the workshop of the Golden Key, there issued forth a tinkling 

sound, so merry and good-humoured, that it suggested the idea of 

some one working blithely, and made quite pleasant music.  No man 

who hammered on at a dull monotonous duty, could have brought such 

cheerful notes from steel and iron; none but a chirping, healthy, 

honest-hearted fellow, who made the best of everything, and felt 

kindly towards everybody, could have done it for an instant.  He 

might have been a coppersmith, and still been musical.  If he had 

sat in a jolting waggon, full of rods of iron, it seemed as if he 

would have brought some harmony out of it.



Tink, tink, tink--clear as a silver bell, and audible at every 

pause of the streets' harsher noises, as though it said, 'I don't 

care; nothing puts me out; I am resolved to he happy.'  Women 

scolded, children squalled, heavy carts went rumbling by, horrible 

cries proceeded from the lungs of hawkers; still it struck in 

again, no higher, no lower, no louder, no softer; not thrusting 

itself on people's notice a bit the more for having been outdone by 

louder sounds--tink, tink, tink, tink, tink.



It was a perfect embodiment of the still small voice, free from all 

cold, hoarseness, huskiness, or unhealthiness of any kind; foot-

passengers slackened their pace, and were disposed to linger near 

it; neighbours who had got up splenetic that morning, felt good-

humour stealing on them as they heard it, and by degrees became 

quite sprightly; mothers danced their babies to its ringing; still 

the same magical tink, tink, tink, came gaily from the workshop of 

the Golden Key.



Who but the locksmith could have made such music!  A gleam of sun 

shining through the unsashed window, and chequering the dark 

workshop with a broad patch of light, fell full upon him, as though 

attracted by his sunny heart.  There he stood working at his anvil, 

his face all radiant with exercise and gladness, his sleeves turned 

up, his wig pushed off his shining forehead--the easiest, freest, 

happiest man in all the world.  Beside him sat a sleek cat, purring 

and winking in the light, and falling every now and then into an 

idle doze, as from excess of comfort.  Toby looked on from a tall 

bench hard by; one beaming smile, from his broad nut-brown face 

down to the slack-baked buckles in his shoes.  The very locks that 

hung around had something jovial in their rust, and seemed like 

gouty gentlemen of hearty natures, disposed to joke on their 

infirmities.  There was nothing surly or severe in the whole scene.  

It seemed impossible that any one of the innumerable keys could fit 

a churlish strong-box or a prison-door.  Cellars of beer and wine, 

rooms where there were fires, books, gossip, and cheering laughter--

these were their proper sphere of action.  Places of distrust and 

cruelty, and restraint, they would have left quadruple-locked for 

ever.



Tink, tink, tink.  The locksmith paused at last, and wiped his 

brow.  The silence roused the cat, who, jumping softly down, crept 

to the door, and watched with tiger eyes a bird-cage in an opposite 

window.  Gabriel lifted Toby to his mouth, and took a hearty 

draught.



Then, as he stood upright, with his head flung back, and his portly 

chest thrown out, you would have seen that Gabriel's lower man was 

clothed in military gear.  Glancing at the wall beyond, there might 

have been espied, hanging on their several pegs, a cap and feather, 

broadsword, sash, and coat of scarlet; which any man learned in 

such matters would have known from their make and pattern to be the 

uniform of a serjeant in the Royal East London Volunteers.



As the locksmith put his mug down, empty, on the bench whence it 

had smiled on him before, he glanced at these articles with a 

laughing eye, and looking at them with his head a little on one 

side, as though he would get them all into a focus, said, leaning 

on his hammer:



'Time was, now, I remember, when I was like to run mad with the 

desire to wear a coat of that colour.  If any one (except my 

father) had called me a fool for my pains, how I should have fired 

and fumed!  But what a fool I must have been, sure-ly!'



'Ah!' sighed Mrs Varden, who had entered unobserved.  'A fool 

indeed.  A man at your time of life, Varden, should know better 

now.'



'Why, what a ridiculous woman you are, Martha,' said the locksmith, 

turning round with a smile.



'Certainly,' replied Mrs V. with great demureness.  'Of course I 

am.  I know that, Varden.  Thank you.'



'I mean--' began the locksmith.



'Yes,' said his wife, 'I know what you mean.  You speak quite plain 

enough to be understood, Varden.  It's very kind of you to adapt 

yourself to my capacity, I am sure.'



'Tut, tut, Martha,' rejoined the locksmith; 'don't take offence at 

nothing.  I mean, how strange it is of you to run down 

volunteering, when it's done to defend you and all the other women, 

and our own fireside and everybody else's, in case of need.'



'It's unchristian,' cried Mrs Varden, shaking her head.



'Unchristian!' said the locksmith.  'Why, what the devil--'



Mrs Varden looked at the ceiling, as in expectation that the 

consequence of this profanity would be the immediate descent of the 

four-post bedstead on the second floor, together with the best 

sitting-room on the first; but no visible judgment occurring, she 

heaved a deep sigh, and begged her husband, in a tone of 

resignation, to go on, and by all means to blaspheme as much as 

possible, because he knew she liked it.



The locksmith did for a moment seem disposed to gratify her, but he 

gave a great gulp, and mildly rejoined:



'I was going to say, what on earth do you call it unchristian for?  

Which would be most unchristian, Martha--to sit quietly down and 

let our houses be sacked by a foreign army, or to turn out like men 

and drive 'em off?  Shouldn't I be a nice sort of a Christian, if I 

crept into a corner of my own chimney and looked on while a parcel 

of whiskered savages bore off Dolly--or you?'



When he said 'or you,' Mrs Varden, despite herself, relaxed into a 

smile.  There was something complimentary in the idea.  'In such a 

state of things as that, indeed--' she simpered.



'As that!' repeated the locksmith.  'Well, that would be the state 

of things directly.  Even Miggs would go.  Some black tambourine-

player, with a great turban on, would be bearing HER off, and, 

unless the tambourine-player was proof against kicking and 

scratching, it's my belief he'd have the worst of it.  Ha ha ha!  

I'd forgive the tambourine-player.  I wouldn't have him interfered 

with on any account, poor fellow.'  And here the locksmith laughed 

again so heartily, that tears came into his eyes--much to Mrs 

Varden's indignation, who thought the capture of so sound a 

Protestant and estimable a private character as Miggs by a pagan 

negro, a circumstance too shocking and awful for contemplation.



The picture Gabriel had drawn, indeed, threatened serious 

consequences, and would indubitably have led to them, but luckily 

at that moment a light footstep crossed the threshold, and Dolly, 

running in, threw her arms round her old father's neck and hugged 

him tight.



'Here she is at last!' cried Gabriel.  'And how well you look, 

Doll, and how late you are, my darling!'



How well she looked?  Well?  Why, if he had exhausted every 

laudatory adjective in the dictionary, it wouldn't have been praise 

enough.  When and where was there ever such a plump, roguish, 

comely, bright-eyed, enticing, bewitching, captivating, maddening 

little puss in all this world, as Dolly!  What was the Dolly of 

five years ago, to the Dolly of that day!  How many coachmakers, 

saddlers, cabinet-makers, and professors of other useful arts, had 

deserted their fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, and, most of 

all, their cousins, for the love of her!  How many unknown 

gentlemen--supposed to be of mighty fortunes, if not titles--had 

waited round the corner after dark, and tempted Miggs the 

incorruptible, with golden guineas, to deliver offers of marriage 

folded up in love-letters!  How many disconsolate fathers and 

substantial tradesmen had waited on the locksmith for the same 

purpose, with dismal tales of how their sons had lost their 

appetites, and taken to shut themselves up in dark bedrooms, and 

wandering in desolate suburbs with pale faces, and all because of 

Dolly Varden's loveliness and cruelty!  How many young men, in all 

previous times of unprecedented steadiness, had turned suddenly 

wild and wicked for the same reason, and, in an ecstasy of 

unrequited love, taken to wrench off door-knockers, and invert the 

boxes of rheumatic watchmen!  How had she recruited the king's 

service, both by sea and land, through rendering desperate his 

loving subjects between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five!  How 

many young ladies had publicly professed, with tears in their eyes, 

that for their tastes she was much too short, too tall, too bold, 

too cold, too stout, too thin, too fair, too dark--too everything 

but handsome!  How many old ladies, taking counsel together, had 

thanked Heaven their daughters were not like her, and had hoped she 

might come to no harm, and had thought she would come to no good, 

and had wondered what people saw in her, and had arrived at the 

conclusion that she was 'going off' in her looks, or had never come 

on in them, and that she was a thorough imposition and a popular 

mistake!



And yet here was this same Dolly Varden, so whimsical and hard to 

please that she was Dolly Varden still, all smiles and dimples and 

pleasant looks, and caring no more for the fifty or sixty young 

fellows who at that very moment were breaking their hearts to marry 

her, than if so many oysters had been crossed in love and opened 

afterwards.



Dolly hugged her father as has been already stated, and having 

hugged her mother also, accompanied both into the little parlour 

where the cloth was already laid for dinner, and where Miss Miggs--

a trifle more rigid and bony than of yore--received her with a sort 

of hysterical gasp, intended for a smile.  Into the hands of that 

young virgin, she delivered her bonnet and walking dress (all of a 

dreadful, artful, and designing kind), and then said with a laugh, 

which rivalled the locksmith's music, 'How glad I always am to be 

at home again!'



'And how glad we always are, Doll,' said her father, putting back 

the dark hair from her sparkling eyes, 'to have you at home.  Give 

me a kiss.'



If there had been anybody of the male kind there to see her do it--

but there was not--it was a mercy.



'I don't like your being at the Warren,' said the locksmith, 'I 

can't bear to have you out of my sight.  And what is the news over 

yonder, Doll?'



'What news there is, I think you know already,' replied his 

daughter.  'I am sure you do though.'



'Ay?' cried the locksmith.  'What's that?'



'Come, come,' said Dolly, 'you know very well.  I want you to tell 

me why Mr Haredale--oh, how gruff he is again, to be sure!--has 

been away from home for some days past, and why he is travelling 

about (we know he IS travelling, because of his letters) without 

telling his own niece why or wherefore.'



'Miss Emma doesn't want to know, I'll swear,' returned the 

locksmith.



'I don't know that,' said Dolly; 'but I do, at any rate.  Do tell 

me.  Why is he so secret, and what is this ghost story, which 

nobody is to tell Miss Emma, and which seems to be mixed up with 

his going away?  Now I see you know by your colouring so.'



'What the story means, or is, or has to do with it, I know no more 

than you, my dear,' returned the locksmith, 'except that it's some 

foolish fear of little Solomon's--which has, indeed, no meaning in 

it, I suppose.  As to Mr Haredale's journey, he goes, as I believe--'



'Yes,' said Dolly.



'As I believe,' resumed the locksmith, pinching her cheek, 'on 

business, Doll.  What it may be, is quite another matter.  Read 

Blue Beard, and don't be too curious, pet; it's no business of 

yours or mine, depend upon that; and here's dinner, which is much 

more to the purpose.'



Dolly might have remonstrated against this summary dismissal of the 

subject, notwithstanding the appearance of dinner, but at the 

mention of Blue Beard Mrs Varden interposed, protesting she could 

not find it in her conscience to sit tamely by, and hear her child 

recommended to peruse the adventures of a Turk and Mussulman--far 

less of a fabulous Turk, which she considered that potentate to be.  

She held that, in such stirring and tremendous times as those in 

which they lived, it would be much more to the purpose if Dolly 

became a regular subscriber to the Thunderer, where she would have 

an opportunity of reading Lord George Gordon's speeches word for 

word, which would be a greater comfort and solace to her, than a 

hundred and fifty Blue Beards ever could impart.  She appealed in 

support of this proposition to Miss Miggs, then in waiting, who 

said that indeed the peace of mind she had derived from the perusal 

of that paper generally, but especially of one article of the very 

last week as ever was, entitled 'Great Britain drenched in gore,' 

exceeded all belief; the same composition, she added, had also 

wrought such a comforting effect on the mind of a married sister of 

hers, then resident at Golden Lion Court, number twenty-sivin, 

second bell-handle on the right-hand door-post, that, being in a 

delicate state of health, and in fact expecting an addition to her 

family, she had been seized with fits directly after its perusal, 

and had raved of the Inquisition ever since; to the great 

improvement of her husband and friends.  Miss Miggs went on to say 

that she would recommend all those whose hearts were hardened to 

hear Lord George themselves, whom she commended first, in respect 

of his steady Protestantism, then of his oratory, then of his eyes, 

then of his nose, then of his legs, and lastly of his figure 

generally, which she looked upon as fit for any statue, prince, or 

angel, to which sentiment Mrs Varden fully subscribed.



Mrs Varden having cut in, looked at a box upon the mantelshelf, 

painted in imitation of a very red-brick dwelling-house, with a 

yellow roof; having at top a real chimney, down which voluntary 

subscribers dropped their silver, gold, or pence, into the parlour; 

and on the door the counterfeit presentment of a brass plate, 

whereon was legibly inscribed 'Protestant Association:'--and 

looking at it, said, that it was to her a source of poignant misery 

to think that Varden never had, of all his substance, dropped 

anything into that temple, save once in secret--as she afterwards 

discovered--two fragments of tobacco-pipe, which she hoped would 

not be put down to his last account.  That Dolly, she was grieved 

to say, was no less backward in her contributions, better loving, 

as it seemed, to purchase ribbons and such gauds, than to encourage 

the great cause, then in such heavy tribulation; and that she did 

entreat her (her father she much feared could not be moved) not to 

despise, but imitate, the bright example of Miss Miggs, who flung 

her wages, as it were, into the very countenance of the Pope, and 

bruised his features with her quarter's money.



'Oh, mim,' said Miggs, 'don't relude to that.  I had no intentions, 

mim, that nobody should know.  Such sacrifices as I can make, are 

quite a widder's mite.  It's all I have,' cried Miggs with a great 

burst of tears--for with her they never came on by degrees--'but 

it's made up to me in other ways; it's well made up.'



This was quite true, though not perhaps in the sense that Miggs 

intended.  As she never failed to keep her self-denial full in Mrs 

Varden's view, it drew forth so many gifts of caps and gowns and 

other articles of dress, that upon the whole the red-brick house 

was perhaps the best investment for her small capital she could 

possibly have hit upon; returning her interest, at the rate of 

seven or eight per cent in money, and fifty at least in personal 

repute and credit.



'You needn't cry, Miggs,' said Mrs Varden, herself in tears; 'you 

needn't be ashamed of it, though your poor mistress IS on the same 

side.'



Miggs howled at this remark, in a peculiarly dismal way, and said 

she knowed that master hated her.  That it was a dreadful thing to 

live in families and have dislikes, and not give satisfactions.  

That to make divisions was a thing she could not abear to think of, 

neither could her feelings let her do it.  That if it was master's 

wishes as she and him should part, it was best they should part, 

and she hoped he might be the happier for it, and always wished him 

well, and that he might find somebody as would meet his 

dispositions.  It would be a hard trial, she said, to part from 

such a missis, but she could meet any suffering when her conscience 

told her she was in the rights, and therefore she was willing even 

to go that lengths.  She did not think, she added, that she could 

long survive the separations, but, as she was hated and looked upon 

unpleasant, perhaps her dying as soon as possible would be the best 

endings for all parties.  With this affecting conclusion, Miss 

Miggs shed more tears, and sobbed abundantly.



'Can you bear this, Varden?' said his wife in a solemn voice, 

laying down her knife and fork.



'Why, not very well, my dear,' rejoined the locksmith, 'but I try 

to keep my temper.'



'Don't let there be words on my account, mim,' sobbed Miggs.  'It's 

much the best that we should part.  I wouldn't stay--oh, gracious 

me!--and make dissensions, not for a annual gold mine, and found in 

tea and sugar.'



Lest the reader should be at any loss to discover the cause of Miss 

Miggs's deep emotion, it may be whispered apart that, happening to 

be listening, as her custom sometimes was, when Gabriel and his 

wife conversed together, she had heard the locksmith's joke 

relative to the foreign black who played the tambourine, and 

bursting with the spiteful feelings which the taunt awoke in her 

fair breast, exploded in the manner we have witnessed.  Matters 

having now arrived at a crisis, the locksmith, as usual, and for 

the sake of peace and quietness, gave in.



'What are you crying for, girl?' he said.  'What's the matter with 

you?  What are you talking about hatred for?  I don't hate you; I 

don't hate anybody.  Dry your eyes and make yourself agreeable, in 

Heaven's name, and let us all be happy while we can.'



The allied powers deeming it good generalship to consider this a 

sufficient apology on the part of the enemy, and confession of 

having been in the wrong, did dry their eyes and take it in good 

part.  Miss Miggs observed that she bore no malice, no not to her 

greatest foe, whom she rather loved the more indeed, the greater 

persecution she sustained.  Mrs Varden approved of this meek and 

forgiving spirit in high terms, and incidentally declared as a 

closing article of agreement, that Dolly should accompany her to 

the Clerkenwell branch of the association, that very night.  This 

was an extraordinary instance of her great prudence and policy; 

having had this end in view from the first, and entertaining a 

secret misgiving that the locksmith (who was bold when Dolly was in 

question) would object, she had backed Miss Miggs up to this 

point, in order that she might have him at a disadvantage.  The 

manoeuvre succeeded so well that Gabriel only made a wry face, and 

with the warning he had just had, fresh in his mind, did not dare 

to say one word.



The difference ended, therefore, in Miggs being presented with a 

gown by Mrs Varden and half-a-crown by Dolly, as if she had 

eminently distinguished herself in the paths of morality and 

goodness.  Mrs V., according to custom, expressed her hope that 

Varden would take a lesson from what had passed and learn more 

generous conduct for the time to come; and the dinner being now 

cold and nobody's appetite very much improved by what had passed, 

they went on with it, as Mrs Varden said, 'like Christians.'



As there was to be a grand parade of the Royal East London 

Volunteers that afternoon, the locksmith did no more work; but sat 

down comfortably with his pipe in his mouth, and his arm round his 

pretty daughter's waist, looking lovingly on Mrs V., from time to 

time, and exhibiting from the crown of his head to the sole of his 

foot, one smiling surface of good humour.  And to be sure, when it 

was time to dress him in his regimentals, and Dolly, hanging about 

him in all kinds of graceful winning ways, helped to button and 

buckle and brush him up and get him into one of the tightest coats 

that ever was made by mortal tailor, he was the proudest father in 

all England.



'What a handy jade it is!' said the locksmith to Mrs Varden, who 

stood by with folded hands--rather proud of her husband too--while 

Miggs held his cap and sword at arm's length, as if mistrusting 

that the latter might run some one through the body of its own 

accord; 'but never marry a soldier, Doll, my dear.'



Dolly didn't ask why not, or say a word, indeed, but stooped her 

head down very low to tie his sash.



'I never wear this dress,' said honest Gabriel, 'but I think of 

poor Joe Willet.  I loved Joe; he was always a favourite of mine.  

Poor Joe!--Dear heart, my girl, don't tie me in so tight.'



Dolly laughed--not like herself at all--the strangest little laugh 

that could be--and held her head down lower still.



'Poor Joe!' resumed the locksmith, muttering to himself; 'I always 

wish he had come to me.  I might have made it up between them, if 

he had.  Ah! old John made a great mistake in his way of acting by 

that lad--a great mistake.--Have you nearly tied that sash, my 

dear?'



What an ill-made sash it was!  There it was, loose again and 

trailing on the ground.  Dolly was obliged to kneel down, and 

recommence at the beginning.



'Never mind young Willet, Varden,' said his wife frowning; 'you 

might find some one more deserving to talk about, I think.'



Miss Miggs gave a great sniff to the same effect.



'Nay, Martha,' cried the locksmith, 'don't let us bear too hard 

upon him.  If the lad is dead indeed, we'll deal kindly by his 

memory.'



'A runaway and a vagabond!' said Mrs Varden.



Miss Miggs expressed her concurrence as before.



'A runaway, my dear, but not a vagabond,' returned the locksmith in 

a gentle tone.  'He behaved himself well, did Joe--always--and was 

a handsome, manly fellow.  Don't call him a vagabond, Martha.'



Mrs Varden coughed--and so did Miggs.



'He tried hard to gain your good opinion, Martha, I can tell you,' 

said the locksmith smiling, and stroking his chin.  'Ah! that he 

did.  It seems but yesterday that he followed me out to the Maypole 

door one night, and begged me not to say how like a boy they used 

him--say here, at home, he meant, though at the time, I recollect, 

I didn't understand.  "And how's Miss Dolly, sir?" says Joe,' 

pursued the locksmith, musing sorrowfully, 'Ah!  Poor Joe!'



'Well, I declare,' cried Miggs.  'Oh! Goodness gracious me!'



'What's the matter now?' said Gabriel, turning sharply to her, 

'Why, if here an't Miss Dolly,' said the handmaid, stooping down to 

look into her face, 'a-giving way to floods of tears.  Oh mim! oh 

sir.  Raly it's give me such a turn,' cried the susceptible damsel, 

pressing her hand upon her side to quell the palpitation of her 

heart, 'that you might knock me down with a feather.'



The locksmith, after glancing at Miss Miggs as if he could have 

wished to have a feather brought straightway, looked on with a 

broad stare while Dolly hurried away, followed by that sympathising 

young woman: then turning to his wife, stammered out, 'Is Dolly 

ill?  Have I done anything?  Is it my fault?'



'Your fault!' cried Mrs V. reproachfully.  'There--you had better 

make haste out.'



'What have I done?' said poor Gabriel.  'It was agreed that Mr 

Edward's name was never to be mentioned, and I have not spoken of 

him, have I?'



Mrs Varden merely replied that she had no patience with him, and 

bounced off after the other two.  The unfortunate locksmith wound 

his sash about him, girded on his sword, put on his cap, and walked 

out.



'I am not much of a dab at my exercise,' he said under his breath, 

'but I shall get into fewer scrapes at that work than at this.  

Every man came into the world for something; my department seems to 

be to make every woman cry without meaning it.  It's rather hard!'



But he forgot it before he reached the end of the street, and went 

on with a shining face, nodding to the neighbours, and showering 

about his friendly greetings like mild spring rain.
