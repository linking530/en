'And you're not surprised to hear this, Varden?' said Mr Haredale.  

'Well!  You and she have always been the best friends, and you 

should understand her if anybody does.'



'I ask your pardon, sir,' rejoined the locksmith.  'I didn't say I 

understood her.  I wouldn't have the presumption to say that of any 

woman.  It's not so easily done.  But I am not so much surprised, 

sir, as you expected me to be, certainly.'



'May I ask why not, my good friend?'



'I have seen, sir,' returned the locksmith with evident reluctance, 

'I have seen in connection with her, something that has filled me 

with distrust and uneasiness.  She has made bad friends, how, or 

when, I don't know; but that her house is a refuge for one robber 

and cut-throat at least, I am certain.  There, sir!  Now it's out.'



'Varden!'



'My own eyes, sir, are my witnesses, and for her sake I would be 

willingly half-blind, if I could but have the pleasure of 

mistrusting 'em.  I have kept the secret till now, and it will go 

no further than yourself, I know; but I tell you that with my own 

eyes--broad awake--I saw, in the passage of her house one evening 

after dark, the highwayman who robbed and wounded Mr Edward 

Chester, and on the same night threatened me.'



'And you made no effort to detain him?' said Mr Haredale quickly.



'Sir,' returned the locksmith, 'she herself prevented me--held me, 

with all her strength, and hung about me until he had got clear 

off.'  And having gone so far, he related circumstantially all that 

had passed upon the night in question.



This dialogue was held in a low tone in the locksmith's little 

parlour, into which honest Gabriel had shown his visitor on his 

arrival.  Mr Haredale had called upon him to entreat his company to 

the widow's, that he might have the assistance of his persuasion 

and influence; and out of this circumstance the conversation had 

arisen.



'I forbore,' said Gabriel, 'from repeating one word of this to 

anybody, as it could do her no good and might do her great harm.  I 

thought and hoped, to say the truth, that she would come to me, and 

talk to me about it, and tell me how it was; but though I have 

purposely put myself in her way more than once or twice, she has 

never touched upon the subject--except by a look.  And indeed,' 

said the good-natured locksmith, 'there was a good deal in the 

look, more than could have been put into a great many words.  It 

said among other matters "Don't ask me anything" so imploringly, 

that I didn't ask her anything.  You'll think me an old fool, I 

know, sir.  If it's any relief to call me one, pray do.'



'I am greatly disturbed by what you tell me,' said Mr Haredale, 

after a silence.  'What meaning do you attach to it?'



The locksmith shook his head, and looked doubtfully out of window 

at the failing light.



'She cannot have married again,' said Mr Haredale.



'Not without our knowledge surely, sir.'



'She may have done so, in the fear that it would lead, if known, to 

some objection or estrangement.  Suppose she married incautiously--

it is not improbable, for her existence has been a lonely and 

monotonous one for many years--and the man turned out a ruffian, 

she would be anxious to screen him, and yet would revolt from his 

crimes.  This might be.  It bears strongly on the whole drift of 

her discourse yesterday, and would quite explain her conduct.  Do 

you suppose Barnaby is privy to these circumstances?'



'Quite impossible to say, sir,' returned the locksmith, shaking his 

head again: 'and next to impossible to find out from him.  If what 

you suppose is really the case, I tremble for the lad--a notable 

person, sir, to put to bad uses--'



'It is not possible, Varden,' said Mr Haredale, in a still lower 

tone of voice than he had spoken yet, 'that we have been blinded 

and deceived by this woman from the beginning?  It is not possible 

that this connection was formed in her husband's lifetime, and led 

to his and my brother's--'



'Good God, sir,' cried Gabriel, interrupting him, 'don't entertain 

such dark thoughts for a moment.  Five-and-twenty years ago, where 

was there a girl like her?  A gay, handsome, laughing, bright-eyed 

damsel!  Think what she was, sir.  It makes my heart ache now, even 

now, though I'm an old man, with a woman for a daughter, to think 

what she was and what she is.  We all change, but that's with Time; 

Time does his work honestly, and I don't mind him.  A fig for Time, 

sir.  Use him well, and he's a hearty fellow, and scorns to have 

you at a disadvantage.  But care and suffering (and those have 

changed her) are devils, sir--secret, stealthy, undermining devils--

who tread down the brightest flowers in Eden, and do more havoc in 

a month than Time does in a year.  Picture to yourself for one 

minute what Mary was before they went to work with her fresh heart 

and face--do her that justice--and say whether such a thing is 

possible.'



'You're a good fellow, Varden,' said Mr Haredale, 'and are quite 

right.  I have brooded on that subject so long, that every breath 

of suspicion carries me back to it.  You are quite right.'



'It isn't, sir,' cried the locksmith with brightened eyes, and 

sturdy, honest voice; 'it isn't because I courted her before Rudge, 

and failed, that I say she was too good for him.  She would have 

been as much too good for me.  But she WAS too good for him; he 

wasn't free and frank enough for her.  I don't reproach his memory 

with it, poor fellow; I only want to put her before you as she 

really was.  For myself, I'll keep her old picture in my mind; and 

thinking of that, and what has altered her, I'll stand her friend, 

and try to win her back to peace.  And damme, sir,' cried Gabriel, 

'with your pardon for the word, I'd do the same if she had married 

fifty highwaymen in a twelvemonth; and think it in the Protestant 

Manual too, though Martha said it wasn't, tooth and nail, till 

doomsday!'



If the dark little parlour had been filled with a dense fog, which, 

clearing away in an instant, left it all radiance and brightness, 

it could not have been more suddenly cheered than by this outbreak 

on the part of the hearty locksmith.  In a voice nearly as full and 

round as his own, Mr Haredale cried 'Well said!' and bade him come 

away without more parley.  The locksmith complied right willingly; 

and both getting into a hackney coach which was waiting at the 

door, drove off straightway.



They alighted at the street corner, and dismissing their 

conveyance, walked to the house.  To their first knock at the door 

there was no response.  A second met with the like result.  But in 

answer to the third, which was of a more vigorous kind, the parlour 

window-sash was gently raised, and a musical voice cried:



'Haredale, my dear fellow, I am extremely glad to see you.  How 

very much you have improved in your appearance since our last 

meeting!  I never saw you looking better.  HOW do you do?'



Mr Haredale turned his eyes towards the casement whence the voice 

proceeded, though there was no need to do so, to recognise the 

speaker, and Mr Chester waved his hand, and smiled a courteous 

welcome.



'The door will be opened immediately,' he said.  'There is nobody 

but a very dilapidated female to perform such offices.  You will 

excuse her infirmities?  If she were in a more elevated station of 

society, she would be gouty.  Being but a hewer of wood and drawer 

of water, she is rheumatic.  My dear Haredale, these are natural 

class distinctions, depend upon it.'



Mr Haredale, whose face resumed its lowering and distrustful look 

the moment he heard the voice, inclined his head stiffly, and 

turned his back upon the speaker.



'Not opened yet,' said Mr Chester.  'Dear me!  I hope the aged soul 

has not caught her foot in some unlucky cobweb by the way.  She is 

there at last!  Come in, I beg!'



Mr Haredale entered, followed by the locksmith.  Turning with a 

look of great astonishment to the old woman who had opened the 

door, he inquired for Mrs Rudge--for Barnaby.  They were both gone, 

she replied, wagging her ancient head, for good.  There was a 

gentleman in the parlour, who perhaps could tell them more.  That 

was all SHE knew.



'Pray, sir,' said Mr Haredale, presenting himself before this new 

tenant, 'where is the person whom I came here to see?'



'My dear friend,' he returned, 'I have not the least idea.'



'Your trifling is ill-timed,' retorted the other in a suppressed 

tone and voice, 'and its subject ill-chosen.  Reserve it for those 

who are your friends, and do not expend it on me.  I lay no claim 

to the distinction, and have the self-denial to reject it.'



'My dear, good sir,' said Mr Chester, 'you are heated with walking.  

Sit down, I beg.  Our friend is--'



'Is but a plain honest man,' returned Mr Haredale, 'and quite 

unworthy of your notice.'



'Gabriel Varden by name, sir,' said the locksmith bluntly.



'A worthy English yeoman!' said Mr Chester.  'A most worthy 

yeoman, of whom I have frequently heard my son Ned--darling fellow--

speak, and have often wished to see.  Varden, my good friend, I am 

glad to know you.  You wonder now,' he said, turning languidly to 

Mr Haredale, 'to see me here.  Now, I am sure you do.'



Mr Haredale glanced at him--not fondly or admiringly--smiled, and 

held his peace.



'The mystery is solved in a moment,' said Mr Chester; 'in a moment.  

Will you step aside with me one instant.  You remember our little 

compact in reference to Ned, and your dear niece, Haredale?  You 

remember the list of assistants in their innocent intrigue?  You 

remember these two people being among them?  My dear fellow, 

congratulate yourself, and me.  I have bought them off.'



'You have done what?' said Mr Haredale.



'Bought them off,' returned his smiling friend.  'I have found it 

necessary to take some active steps towards setting this boy and 

girl attachment quite at rest, and have begun by removing these two 

agents.  You are surprised?  Who CAN withstand the influence of a 

little money!  They wanted it, and have been bought off.  We have 

nothing more to fear from them.  They are gone.'



'Gone!' echoed Mr Haredale.  'Where?'



'My dear fellow--and you must permit me to say again, that you 

never looked so young; so positively boyish as you do to-night--the 

Lord knows where; I believe Columbus himself wouldn't find them.  

Between you and me they have their hidden reasons, but upon that 

point I have pledged myself to secrecy.  She appointed to see you 

here to-night, I know, but found it inconvenient, and couldn't 

wait.  Here is the key of the door.  I am afraid you'll find it 

inconveniently large; but as the tenement is yours, your good-

nature will excuse that, Haredale, I am certain!'
