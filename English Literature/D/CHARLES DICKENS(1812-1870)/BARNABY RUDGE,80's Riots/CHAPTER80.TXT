That afternoon, when he had slept off his fatigue; had shaved, and 

washed, and dressed, and freshened himself from top to toe; when he 

had dined, comforted himself with a pipe, an extra Toby, a nap in 

the great arm-chair, and a quiet chat with Mrs Varden on everything 

that had happened, was happening, or about to happen, within the 

sphere of their domestic concern; the locksmith sat himself down at 

the tea-table in the little back-parlour: the rosiest, cosiest, 

merriest, heartiest, best-contented old buck, in Great Britain or 

out of it.



There he sat, with his beaming eye on Mrs V., and his shining face 

suffused with gladness, and his capacious waistcoat smiling in 

every wrinkle, and his jovial humour peeping from under the table 

in the very plumpness of his legs; a sight to turn the vinegar of 

misanthropy into purest milk of human kindness.  There he sat, 

watching his wife as she decorated the room with flowers for the 

greater honour of Dolly and Joseph Willet, who had gone out 

walking, and for whom the tea-kettle had been singing gaily on the 

hob full twenty minutes, chirping as never kettle chirped before; 

for whom the best service of real undoubted china, patterned with 

divers round-faced mandarins holding up broad umbrellas, was now 

displayed in all its glory; to tempt whose appetites a clear, 

transparent, juicy ham, garnished with cool green lettuce-leaves 

and fragrant cucumber, reposed upon a shady table, covered with a 

snow-white cloth; for whose delight, preserves and jams, crisp 

cakes and other pastry, short to eat, with cunning twists, and 

cottage loaves, and rolls of bread both white and brown, were all 

set forth in rich profusion; in whose youth Mrs V.  herself had 

grown quite young, and stood there in a gown of red and white: 

symmetrical in figure, buxom in bodice, ruddy in cheek and lip, 

faultless in ankle, laughing in face and mood, in all respects 

delicious to behold--there sat the locksmith among all and every 

these delights, the sun that shone upon them all: the centre of the 

system: the source of light, heat, life, and frank enjoyment in the 

bright household world.



And when had Dolly ever been the Dolly of that afternoon?  To see 

how she came in, arm-in-arm with Joe; and how she made an effort 

not to blush or seem at all confused; and how she made believe she 

didn't care to sit on his side of the table; and how she coaxed the 

locksmith in a whisper not to joke; and how her colour came and 

went in a little restless flutter of happiness, which made her do 

everything wrong, and yet so charmingly wrong that it was better 

than right!--why, the locksmith could have looked on at this (as he 

mentioned to Mrs Varden when they retired for the night) for four-

and-twenty hours at a stretch, and never wished it done.



The recollections, too, with which they made merry over that long 

protracted tea!  The glee with which the locksmith asked Joe if he 

remembered that stormy night at the Maypole when he first asked 

after Dolly--the laugh they all had, about that night when she was 

going out to the party in the sedan-chair--the unmerciful manner in 

which they rallied Mrs Varden about putting those flowers outside 

that very window--the difficulty Mrs Varden found in joining the 

laugh against herself, at first, and the extraordinary perception 

she had of the joke when she overcame it--the confidential 

statements of Joe concerning the precise day and hour when he was 

first conscious of being fond of Dolly, and Dolly's blushing 

admissions, half volunteered and half extorted, as to the time from 

which she dated the discovery that she 'didn't mind' Joe--here was 

an exhaustless fund of mirth and conversation.



Then, there was a great deal to be said regarding Mrs Varden's 

doubts, and motherly alarms, and shrewd suspicions; and it appeared 

that from Mrs Varden's penetration and extreme sagacity nothing had 

ever been hidden.  She had known it all along.  She had seen it 

from the first.  She had always predicted it.  She had been aware 

of it before the principals.  She had said within herself (for she 

remembered the exact words) 'that young Willet is certainly 

looking after our Dolly, and I must look after HIM.'  Accordingly, 

she had looked after him, and had observed many little 

circumstances (all of which she named) so exceedingly minute that 

nobody else could make anything out of them even now; and had, it 

seemed from first to last, displayed the most unbounded tact and 

most consummate generalship.



Of course the night when Joe WOULD ride homeward by the side of the 

chaise, and when Mrs Varden WOULD insist upon his going back again, 

was not forgotten--nor the night when Dolly fainted on his name 

being mentioned--nor the times upon times when Mrs Varden, ever 

watchful and prudent, had found her pining in her own chamber.  In 

short, nothing was forgotten; and everything by some means or other 

brought them back to the conclusion, that that was the happiest 

hour in all their lives; consequently, that everything must have 

occurred for the best, and nothing could be suggested which would 

have made it better.



While they were in the full glow of such discourse as this, there 

came a startling knock at the door, opening from the street into 

the workshop, which had been kept closed all day that the house 

might be more quiet.  Joe, as in duty bound, would hear of nobody 

but himself going to open it; and accordingly left the room for 

that purpose.



It would have been odd enough, certainly, if Joe had forgotten the 

way to this door; and even if he had, as it was a pretty large one 

and stood straight before him, he could not easily have missed it.  

But Dolly, perhaps because she was in the flutter of spirits before 

mentioned, or perhaps because she thought he would not be able to 

open it with his one arm--she could have had no other reason--

hurried out after him; and they stopped so long in the passage--no 

doubt owing to Joe's entreaties that she would not expose herself 

to the draught of July air which must infallibly come rushing in on 

this same door being opened--that the knock was repeated, in a yet 

more startling manner than before.



'Is anybody going to open that door?' cried the locksmith.  'Or 

shall I come?'



Upon that, Dolly went running back into the parlour, all dimples 

and blushes; and Joe opened it with a mighty noise, and other 

superfluous demonstrations of being in a violent hurry.



'Well,' said the locksmith, when he reappeared: 'what is it?  eh 

Joe? what are you laughing at?'



'Nothing, sir.  It's coming in.'



'Who's coming in? what's coming in?'  Mrs Varden, as much at a loss 

as her husband, could only shake her head in answer to his 

inquiring look: so, the locksmith wheeled his chair round to 

command a better view of the room-door, and stared at it with his 

eyes wide open, and a mingled expression of curiosity and wonder 

shining in his jolly face.



Instead of some person or persons straightway appearing, divers 

remarkable sounds were heard, first in the workshop and afterwards 

in the little dark passage between it and the parlour, as though 

some unwieldy chest or heavy piece of furniture were being brought 

in, by an amount of human strength inadequate to the task.  At 

length after much struggling and humping, and bruising of the wall 

on both sides, the door was forced open as by a battering-ram; and 

the locksmith, steadily regarding what appeared beyond, smote his 

thigh, elevated his eyebrows, opened his mouth, and cried in a loud 

voice expressive of the utmost consternation:



'Damme, if it an't Miggs come back!'



The young damsel whom he named no sooner heard these words, than 

deserting a small boy and a very large box by which she was 

accompanied, and advancing with such precipitation that her bonnet 

flew off her head, burst into the room, clasped her hands (in which 

she held a pair of pattens, one in each), raised her eyes devotedly 

to the ceiling, and shed a flood of tears.



'The old story!' cried the locksmith, looking at her in 

inexpressible desperation.  'She was born to be a damper, this 

young woman! nothing can prevent it!'



'Ho master, ho mim!' cried Miggs, 'can I constrain my feelings in 

these here once agin united moments!  Ho Mr Warsen, here's 

blessedness among relations, sir!  Here's forgivenesses of 

injuries, here's amicablenesses!'



The locksmith looked from his wife to Dolly, and from Dolly to Joe, 

and from Joe to Miggs, with his eyebrows still elevated and his 

mouth still open.  When his eyes got back to Miggs, they rested on 

her; fascinated.



'To think,' cried Miggs with hysterical joy, 'that Mr Joe, and dear 

Miss Dolly, has raly come together after all as has been said and 

done contrairy!  To see them two a-settin' along with him and her, 

so pleasant and in all respects so affable and mild; and me not 

knowing of it, and not being in the ways to make no preparations 

for their teas.  Ho what a cutting thing it is, and yet what sweet 

sensations is awoke within me!'



Either in clasping her hands again, or in an ecstasy of pious joy, 

Miss Miggs clinked her pattens after the manner of a pair of 

cymbals, at this juncture; and then resumed, in the softest 

accents:



'And did my missis think--ho goodness, did she think--as her own 

Miggs, which supported her under so many trials, and understood her 

natur' when them as intended well but acted rough, went so deep 

into her feelings--did she think as her own Miggs would ever leave 

her?  Did she think as Miggs, though she was but a servant, and 

knowed that servitudes was no inheritances, would forgit that she 

was the humble instruments as always made it comfortable between 

them two when they fell out, and always told master of the meekness 

and forgiveness of her blessed dispositions!  Did she think as 

Miggs had no attachments!  Did she think that wages was her only 

object!'



To none of these interrogatories, whereof every one was more 

pathetically delivered than the last, did Mrs Varden answer one 

word: but Miggs, not at all abashed by this circumstance, turned to 

the small boy in attendance--her eldest nephew--son of her own 

married sister--born in Golden Lion Court, number twenty-sivin, 

and bred in the very shadow of the second bell-handle on the right-

hand door-post--and with a plentiful use of her pocket-

handkerchief, addressed herself to him: requesting that on his 

return home he would console his parents for the loss of her, his 

aunt, by delivering to them a faithful statement of his having left 

her in the bosom of that family, with which, as his aforesaid 

parents well knew, her best affections were incorporated; that he 

would remind them that nothing less than her imperious sense of 

duty, and devoted attachment to her old master and missis, likewise 

Miss Dolly and young Mr Joe, should ever have induced her to 

decline that pressing invitation which they, his parents, had, as 

he could testify, given her, to lodge and board with them, free of 

all cost and charge, for evermore; lastly, that he would help her 

with her box upstairs, and then repair straight home, bearing her 

blessing and her strong injunctions to mingle in his prayers a 

supplication that he might in course of time grow up a locksmith, 

or a Mr Joe, and have Mrs Vardens and Miss Dollys for his relations 

and friends.



Having brought this admonition to an end--upon which, to say the 

truth, the young gentleman for whose benefit it was designed, 

bestowed little or no heed, having to all appearance his faculties 

absorbed in the contemplation of the sweetmeats,--Miss Miggs 

signified to the company in general that they were not to be 

uneasy, for she would soon return; and, with her nephew's aid, 

prepared to bear her wardrobe up the staircase.



'My dear,' said the locksmith to his wife.  'Do you desire this?'



'I desire it!' she answered.  'I am astonished--I am amazed--at her 

audacity.  Let her leave the house this moment.'



Miggs, hearing this, let her end of the box fall heavily to the 

floor, gave a very loud sniff, crossed her arms, screwed down the 

corners of her mouth, and cried, in an ascending scale, 'Ho, good 

gracious!' three distinct times.



'You hear what your mistress says, my love,' remarked the 

locksmith.  'You had better go, I think.  Stay; take this with you, 

for the sake of old service.'



Miss Miggs clutched the bank-note he took from his pocket-book and 

held out to her; deposited it in a small, red leather purse; put 

the purse in her pocket (displaying, as she did so, a considerable 

portion of some under-garment, made of flannel, and more black 

cotton stocking than is commonly seen in public); and, tossing her 

head, as she looked at Mrs Varden, repeated--



'Ho, good gracious!'



'I think you said that once before, my dear,' observed the 

locksmith.



'Times is changed, is they, mim!' cried Miggs, bridling; 'you can 

spare me now, can you?  You can keep 'em down without me?  You're 

not in wants of any one to scold, or throw the blame upon, no 

longer, an't you, mim?  I'm glad to find you've grown so 

independent.  I wish you joy, I'm sure!'



With that she dropped a curtsey, and keeping her head erect, her 

ear towards Mrs Varden, and her eye on the rest of the company, as 

she alluded to them in her remarks, proceeded:



'I'm quite delighted, I'm sure, to find sich independency, feeling 

sorry though, at the same time, mim, that you should have been 

forced into submissions when you couldn't help yourself--he he he!  

It must be great vexations, 'specially considering how ill you 

always spoke of Mr Joe--to have him for a son-in-law at last; and 

I wonder Miss Dolly can put up with him, either, after being off 

and on for so many years with a coachmaker.  But I HAVE heerd say, 

that the coachmaker thought twice about it--he he he!--and that he 

told a young man as was a frind of his, that he hoped he knowed 

better than to be drawed into that; though she and all the family 

DID pull uncommon strong!'



Here she paused for a reply, and receiving none, went on as before.



'I HAVE heerd say, mim, that the illnesses of some ladies was all 

pretensions, and that they could faint away, stone dead, whenever 

they had the inclinations so to do.  Of course I never see sich 

cases with my own eyes--ho no!  He he he!  Nor master neither--ho 

no!  He he he!  I HAVE heerd the neighbours make remark as some one 

as they was acquainted with, was a poor good-natur'd mean-spirited 

creetur, as went out fishing for a wife one day, and caught a 

Tartar.  Of course I never to my knowledge see the poor person 

himself.  Nor did you neither, mim--ho no.  I wonder who it can 

be--don't you, mim?  No doubt you do, mim.  Ho yes.  He he he!'



Again Miggs paused for a reply; and none being offered, was so 

oppressed with teeming spite and spleen, that she seemed like to 

burst.



'I'm glad Miss Dolly can laugh,' cried Miggs with a feeble titter.  

'I like to see folks a-laughing--so do you, mim, don't you?  You 

was always glad to see people in spirits, wasn't you, mim?  And you 

always did your best to keep 'em cheerful, didn't you, mim?  

Though there an't such a great deal to laugh at now either; is 

there, mim?  It an't so much of a catch, after looking out so sharp 

ever since she was a little chit, and costing such a deal in dress 

and show, to get a poor, common soldier, with one arm, is it, mim?  

He he!  I wouldn't have a husband with one arm, anyways.  I would 

have two arms.  I would have two arms, if it was me, though instead 

of hands they'd only got hooks at the end, like our dustman!'



Miss Miggs was about to add, and had, indeed, begun to add, that, 

taking them in the abstract, dustmen were far more eligible matches 

than soldiers, though, to be sure, when people were past choosing 

they must take the best they could get, and think themselves well 

off too; but her vexation and chagrin being of that internally 

bitter sort which finds no relief in words, and is aggravated to 

madness by want of contradiction, she could hold out no longer, and 

burst into a storm of sobs and tears.



In this extremity she fell on the unlucky nephew, tooth and nail, 

and plucking a handful of hair from his head, demanded to know how 

long she was to stand there to be insulted, and whether or no he 

meant to help her to carry out the box again, and if he took a 

pleasure in hearing his family reviled: with other inquiries of 

that nature; at which disgrace and provocation, the small boy, who 

had been all this time gradually lashed into rebellion by the sight 

of unattainable pastry, walked off indignant, leaving his aunt and 

the box to follow at their leisure.  Somehow or other, by dint of 

pushing and pulling, they did attain the street at last; where Miss 

Miggs, all blowzed with the exertion of getting there, and with her 

sobs and tears, sat down upon her property to rest and grieve, 

until she could ensnare some other youth to help her home.



'It's a thing to laugh at, Martha, not to care for,' whispered the 

locksmith, as he followed his wife to the window, and good-

humouredly dried her eyes.  'What does it matter?  You had seen 

your fault before.  Come!  Bring up Toby again, my dear; Dolly 

shall sing us a song; and we'll be all the merrier for this 

interruption!'
