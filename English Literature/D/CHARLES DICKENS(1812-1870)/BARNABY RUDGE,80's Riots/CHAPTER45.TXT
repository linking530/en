While the worst passions of the worst men were thus working in the 

dark, and the mantle of religion, assumed to cover the ugliest 

deformities, threatened to become the shroud of all that was good 

and peaceful in society, a circumstance occurred which once more 

altered the position of two persons from whom this history has long 

been separated, and to whom it must now return.



In a small English country town, the inhabitants of which supported 

themselves by the labour of their hands in plaiting and preparing 

straw for those who made bonnets and other articles of dress and 

ornament from that material,--concealed under an assumed name, and 

living in a quiet poverty which knew no change, no pleasures, and 

few cares but that of struggling on from day to day in one great 

toil for bread,--dwelt Barnaby and his mother.  Their poor cottage 

had known no stranger's foot since they sought the shelter of its 

roof five years before; nor had they in all that time held any 

commerce or communication with the old world from which they had 

fled.  To labour in peace, and devote her labour and her life to 

her poor son, was all the widow sought.  If happiness can be said 

at any time to be the lot of one on whom a secret sorrow preys, she 

was happy now.  Tranquillity, resignation, and her strong love of 

him who needed it so much, formed the small circle of her quiet 

joys; and while that remained unbroken, she was contented.



For Barnaby himself, the time which had flown by, had passed him 

like the wind.  The daily suns of years had shed no brighter gleam 

of reason on his mind; no dawn had broken on his long, dark night.  

He would sit sometimes--often for days together on a low seat by 

the fire or by the cottage door, busy at work (for he had learnt 

the art his mother plied), and listening, God help him, to the 

tales she would repeat, as a lure to keep him in her sight.  He had 

no recollection of these little narratives; the tale of yesterday 

was new to him upon the morrow; but he liked them at the moment; 

and when the humour held him, would remain patiently within doors, 

hearing her stories like a little child, and working cheerfully 

from sunrise until it was too dark to see.



At other times,--and then their scanty earnings were barely 

sufficient to furnish them with food, though of the coarsest sort,--

he would wander abroad from dawn of day until the twilight 

deepened into night.  Few in that place, even of the children, 

could be idle, and he had no companions of his own kind.  Indeed 

there were not many who could have kept up with him in his rambles, 

had there been a legion.  But there were a score of vagabond dogs 

belonging to the neighbours, who served his purpose quite as well.  

With two or three of these, or sometimes with a full half-dozen 

barking at his heels, he would sally forth on some long expedition 

that consumed the day; and though, on their return at nightfall, 

the dogs would come home limping and sore-footed, and almost spent 

with their fatigue, Barnaby was up and off again at sunrise with 

some new attendants of the same class, with whom he would return in 

like manner.  On all these travels, Grip, in his little basket at 

his master's back, was a constant member of the party, and when 

they set off in fine weather and in high spirits, no dog barked 

louder than the raven.



Their pleasures on these excursions were simple enough.  A crust of 

bread and scrap of meat, with water from the brook or spring, 

sufficed for their repast.  Barnaby's enjoyments were, to walk, and 

run, and leap, till he was tired; then to lie down in the long 

grass, or by the growing corn, or in the shade of some tall tree, 

looking upward at the light clouds as they floated over the blue 

surface of the sky, and listening to the lark as she poured out her 

brilliant song.  There were wild-flowers to pluck--the bright red 

poppy, the gentle harebell, the cowslip, and the rose.  There were 

birds to watch; fish; ants; worms; hares or rabbits, as they darted 

across the distant pathway in the wood and so were gone: millions 

of living things to have an interest in, and lie in wait for, and 

clap hands and shout in memory of, when they had disappeared.  In 

default of these, or when they wearied, there was the merry 

sunlight to hunt out, as it crept in aslant through leaves and 

boughs of trees, and hid far down--deep, deep, in hollow places--

like a silver pool, where nodding branches seemed to bathe and 

sport; sweet scents of summer air breathing over fields of beans or 

clover; the perfume of wet leaves or moss; the life of waving 

trees, and shadows always changing.  When these or any of them 

tired, or in excess of pleasing tempted him to shut his eyes, there 

was slumber in the midst of all these soft delights, with the 

gentle wind murmuring like music in his ears, and everything around 

melting into one delicious dream.



Their hut--for it was little more--stood on the outskirts of the 

town, at a short distance from the high road, but in a secluded 

place, where few chance passengers strayed at any season of the 

year.  It had a plot of garden-ground attached, which Barnaby, in 

fits and starts of working, trimmed, and kept in order.  Within 

doors and without, his mother laboured for their common good; and 

hail, rain, snow, or sunshine, found no difference in her.



Though so far removed from the scenes of her past life, and with so 

little thought or hope of ever visiting them again, she seemed to 

have a strange desire to know what happened in the busy world.  Any 

old newspaper, or scrap of intelligence from London, she caught at 

with avidity.  The excitement it produced was not of a pleasurable 

kind, for her manner at such times expressed the keenest anxiety 

and dread; but it never faded in the least degree.  Then, and in 

stormy winter nights, when the wind blew loud and strong, the old 

expression came into her face, and she would be seized with a fit 

of trembling, like one who had an ague.  But Barnaby noted little 

of this; and putting a great constraint upon herself, she usually 

recovered her accustomed manner before the change had caught his 

observation.



Grip was by no means an idle or unprofitable member of the humble 

household.  Partly by dint of Barnaby's tuition, and partly by 

pursuing a species of self-instruction common to his tribe, and 

exerting his powers of observation to the utmost, he had acquired a 

degree of sagacity which rendered him famous for miles round.  His 

conversational powers and surprising performances were the 

universal theme: and as many persons came to see the wonderful 

raven, and none left his exertions unrewarded--when he condescended 

to exhibit, which was not always, for genius is capricious--his 

earnings formed an important item in the common stock.  Indeed, the 

bird himself appeared to know his value well; for though he was 

perfectly free and unrestrained in the presence of Barnaby and his 

mother, he maintained in public an amazing gravity, and never 

stooped to any other gratuitous performances than biting the ankles 

of vagabond boys (an exercise in which he much delighted), killing 

a fowl or two occasionally, and swallowing the dinners of various 

neighbouring dogs, of whom the boldest held him in great awe and 

dread.



Time had glided on in this way, and nothing had happened to disturb 

or change their mode of life, when, one summer's night in June, 

they were in their little garden, resting from the labours of the 

day.  The widow's work was yet upon her knee, and strewn upon the 

ground about her; and Barnaby stood leaning on his spade, gazing at 

the brightness in the west, and singing softly to himself.



'A brave evening, mother!  If we had, chinking in our pockets, but 

a few specks of that gold which is piled up yonder in the sky, we 

should be rich for life.'




'We are better as we are,' returned the widow with a quiet smile.  

'Let us be contented, and we do not want and need not care to have 

it, though it lay shining at our feet.'



'Ay!' said Barnaby, resting with crossed arms on his spade, and 

looking wistfully at the sunset, that's well enough, mother; but 

gold's a good thing to have.  I wish that I knew where to find it.  

Grip and I could do much with gold, be sure of that.'



'What would you do?' she asked.



'What!  A world of things.  We'd dress finely--you and I, I mean; 

not Grip--keep horses, dogs, wear bright colours and feathers, do 

no more work, live delicately and at our ease.  Oh, we'd find uses 

for it, mother, and uses that would do us good.  I would I knew 

where gold was buried.  How hard I'd work to dig it up!'



'You do not know,' said his mother, rising from her seat and laying 

her hand upon his shoulder, 'what men have done to win it, and how 

they have found, too late, that it glitters brightest at a 

distance, and turns quite dim and dull when handled.'



'Ay, ay; so you say; so you think,' he answered, still looking 

eagerly in the same direction.  'For all that, mother, I should 

like to try.'



'Do you not see,' she said, 'how red it is?  Nothing bears so many 

stains of blood, as gold.  Avoid it.  None have such cause to hate 

its name as we have.  Do not so much as think of it, dear love.  It 

has brought such misery and suffering on your head and mine as few 

have known, and God grant few may have to undergo.  I would rather 

we were dead and laid down in our graves, than you should ever come 

to love it.'



For a moment Barnaby withdrew his eyes and looked at her with 

wonder.  Then, glancing from the redness in the sky to the mark 

upon his wrist as if he would compare the two, he seemed about to 

question her with earnestness, when a new object caught his 

wandering attention, and made him quite forgetful of his purpose.



This was a man with dusty feet and garments, who stood, bare-

headed, behind the hedge that divided their patch of garden from 

the pathway, and leant meekly forward as if he sought to mingle 

with their conversation, and waited for his time to speak.  His 

face was turned towards the brightness, too, but the light that 

fell upon it showed that he was blind, and saw it not.



'A blessing on those voices!' said the wayfarer.  'I feel the 

beauty of the night more keenly, when I hear them.  They are like 

eyes to me.  Will they speak again, and cheer the heart of a poor 

traveller?'



'Have you no guide?' asked the widow, after a moment's pause.



'None but that,' he answered, pointing with his staff towards the 

sun; 'and sometimes a milder one at night, but she is idle now.'



'Have you travelled far?'



'A weary way and long,' rejoined the traveller as he shook his 

head.  'A weary, weary, way.  I struck my stick just now upon the 

bucket of your well--be pleased to let me have a draught of water, 

lady.'



'Why do you call me lady?' she returned.  'I am as poor as you.'



'Your speech is soft and gentle, and I judge by that,' replied the 

man.  'The coarsest stuffs and finest silks, are--apart from the 

sense of touch--alike to me.  I cannot judge you by your dress.'



'Come round this way,' said Barnaby, who had passed out at the 

garden-gate and now stood close beside him.  'Put your hand in 

mine.  You're blind and always in the dark, eh?  Are you frightened 

in the dark?  Do you see great crowds of faces, now?  Do they grin 

and chatter?'



'Alas!' returned the other, 'I see nothing.  Waking or sleeping, 

nothing.'



Barnaby looked curiously at his eyes, and touching them with his 

fingers, as an inquisitive child might, led him towards the house.



'You have come a long distance, 'said the widow, meeting him at the 

door.  'How have you found your way so far?'



'Use and necessity are good teachers, as I have heard--the best of 

any,' said the blind man, sitting down upon the chair to which 

Barnaby had led him, and putting his hat and stick upon the red-

tiled floor.  'May neither you nor your son ever learn under them.  

They are rough masters.'



'You have wandered from the road, too,' said the widow, in a tone 

of pity.



'Maybe, maybe,' returned the blind man with a sigh, and yet with 

something of a smile upon his face, 'that's likely.  Handposts and 

milestones are dumb, indeed, to me.  Thank you the more for this 

rest, and this refreshing drink!'



As he spoke, he raised the mug of water to his mouth.  It was 

clear, and cold, and sparkling, but not to his taste nevertheless, 

or his thirst was not very great, for he only wetted his lips and 

put it down again.



He wore, hanging with a long strap round his neck, a kind of scrip 

or wallet, in which to carry food.  The widow set some bread and 

cheese before him, but he thanked her, and said that through the 

kindness of the charitable he had broken his fast once since 

morning, and was not hungry.  When he had made her this reply, he 

opened his wallet, and took out a few pence, which was all it 

appeared to contain.



'Might I make bold to ask,' he said, turning towards where Barnaby 

stood looking on, 'that one who has the gift of sight, would lay 

this out for me in bread to keep me on my way?  Heaven's blessing 

on the young feet that will bestir themselves in aid of one so 

helpless as a sightless man!'



Barnaby looked at his mother, who nodded assent; in another moment 

he was gone upon his charitable errand.  The blind man sat 

listening with an attentive face, until long after the sound of his 

retreating footsteps was inaudible to the widow, and then said, 

suddenly, and in a very altered tone:



'There are various degrees and kinds of blindness, widow.  There 

is the connubial blindness, ma'am, which perhaps you may have 

observed in the course of your own experience, and which is a kind 

of wilful and self-bandaging blindness.  There is the blindness of 

party, ma'am, and public men, which is the blindness of a mad bull 

in the midst of a regiment of soldiers clothed in red.  There is 

the blind confidence of youth, which is the blindness of young 

kittens, whose eyes have not yet opened on the world; and there is 

that physical blindness, ma'am, of which I am, contrairy to my own 

desire, a most illustrious example.  Added to these, ma'am, is that 

blindness of the intellect, of which we have a specimen in your 

interesting son, and which, having sometimes glimmerings and 

dawnings of the light, is scarcely to be trusted as a total 

darkness.  Therefore, ma'am, I have taken the liberty to get him 

out of the way for a short time, while you and I confer together, 

and this precaution arising out of the delicacy of my sentiments 

towards yourself, you will excuse me, ma'am, I know.'



Having delivered himself of this speech with many flourishes of 

manner, he drew from beneath his coat a flat stone bottle, and 

holding the cork between his teeth, qualified his mug of water with 

a plentiful infusion of the liquor it contained.  He politely 

drained the bumper to her health, and the ladies, and setting it 

down empty, smacked his lips with infinite relish.



'I am a citizen of the world, ma'am,' said the blind man, corking 

his bottle, 'and if I seem to conduct myself with freedom, it is 

therefore.  You wonder who I am, ma'am, and what has brought me 

here.  Such experience of human nature as I have, leads me to that 

conclusion, without the aid of eyes by which to read the movements 

of your soul as depicted in your feminine features.  I will 

satisfy your curiosity immediately, ma'am; immediately.'  With 

that he slapped his bottle on its broad back, and having put it 

under his garment as before, crossed his legs and folded his hands, 

and settled himself in his chair, previous to proceeding any 

further.



The change in his manner was so unexpected, the craft and 

wickedness of his deportment were so much aggravated by his 

condition--for we are accustomed to see in those who have lost a 

human sense, something in its place almost divine--and this 

alteration bred so many fears in her whom he addressed, that she 

could not pronounce one word.  After waiting, as it seemed, for 

some remark or answer, and waiting in vain, the visitor resumed:



'Madam, my name is Stagg.  A friend of mine who has desired the 

honour of meeting with you any time these five years past, has 

commissioned me to call upon you.  I should be glad to whisper that 

gentleman's name in your ear.--Zounds, ma'am, are you deaf?  Do you 

hear me say that I should be glad to whisper my friend's name in 

your ear?'



'You need not repeat it,' said the widow, with a stifled groan; 'I 

see too well from whom you come.'



'But as a man of honour, ma'am,' said the blind man, striking 

himself on the breast, 'whose credentials must not be disputed, I 

take leave to say that I WILL mention that gentleman's name.  Ay, 

ay,' he added, seeming to catch with his quick ear the very motion 

of her hand, 'but not aloud.  With your leave, ma'am, I desire the 

favour of a whisper.'



She moved towards him, and stooped down.  He muttered a word in her 

ear; and, wringing her hands, she paced up and down the room like 

one distracted.  The blind man, with perfect composure, produced 

his bottle again, mixed another glassful; put it up as before; and, 

drinking from time to time, followed her with his face in silence.



'You are slow in conversation, widow,' he said after a time, 

pausing in his draught.  'We shall have to talk before your son.'



'What would you have me do?' she answered.  'What do you want?'



'We are poor, widow, we are poor,' he retorted, stretching out his 

right hand, and rubbing his thumb upon its palm.



'Poor!' she cried.  'And what am I?'



'Comparisons are odious,' said the blind man.  'I don't know, I 

don't care.  I say that we are poor.  My friend's circumstances are 

indifferent, and so are mine.  We must have our rights, widow, or 

we must be bought off.  But you know that, as well as I, so where 

is the use of talking?'



She still walked wildly to and fro.  At length, stopping abruptly 

before him, she said:



'Is he near here?'



'He is.  Close at hand.'



'Then I am lost!'



'Not lost, widow,' said the blind man, calmly; 'only found.  Shall 

I call him?'



'Not for the world,' she answered, with a shudder.



'Very good,' he replied, crossing his legs again, for he had made 

as though he would rise and walk to the door.  'As you please, 

widow.  His presence is not necessary that I know of.  But both he 

and I must live; to live, we must eat and drink; to eat and drink, 

we must have money:--I say no more.'



'Do you know how pinched and destitute I am?' she retorted.  'I do 

not think you do, or can.  If you had eyes, and could look around 

you on this poor place, you would have pity on me.  Oh! let your 

heart be softened by your own affliction, friend, and have some 

sympathy with mine.'



The blind man snapped his fingers as he answered:



'--Beside the question, ma'am, beside the question.  I have the 

softest heart in the world, but I can't live upon it.  Many a 

gentleman lives well upon a soft head, who would find a heart of 

the same quality a very great drawback.  Listen to me.  This is a 

matter of business, with which sympathies and sentiments have 

nothing to do.  As a mutual friend, I wish to arrange it in a 

satisfactory manner, if possible; and thus the case stands.--If you 

are very poor now, it's your own choice.  You have friends who, in 

case of need, are always ready to help you.  My friend is in a more 

destitute and desolate situation than most men, and, you and he 

being linked together in a common cause, he naturally looks to you 

to assist him.  He has boarded and lodged with me a long time (for 

as I said just now, I am very soft-hearted), and I quite approve of 

his entertaining this opinion.  You have always had a roof over 

your head; he has always been an outcast.  You have your son to 

comfort and assist you; he has nobody at all.  The advantages must 

not be all one side.  You are in the same boat, and we must divide 

the ballast a little more equally.'



She was about to speak, but he checked her, and went on.



'The only way of doing this, is by making up a little purse now and 

then for my friend; and that's what I advise.  He bears you no 

malice that I know of, ma'am: so little, that although you have 

treated him harshly more than once, and driven him, I may say, out 

of doors, he has that regard for you that I believe even if you 

disappointed him now, he would consent to take charge of your son, 

and to make a man of him.'



He laid a great stress on these latter words, and paused as if to 

find out what effect they had produced.  She only answered by her 

tears.



'He is a likely lad,' said the blind man, thoughtfully, 'for many 

purposes, and not ill-disposed to try his fortune in a little 

change and bustle, if I may judge from what I heard of his talk 

with you to-night.--Come.  In a word, my friend has pressing 

necessity for twenty pounds.  You, who can give up an annuity, can 

get that sum for him.  It's a pity you should be troubled.  You 

seem very comfortable here, and it's worth that much to remain so.  

Twenty pounds, widow, is a moderate demand.  You know where to 

apply for it; a post will bring it you.--Twenty pounds!'



She was about to answer him again, but again he stopped her.



'Don't say anything hastily; you might be sorry for it.  Think of 

it a little while.  Twenty pounds--of other people's money--how 

easy!  Turn it over in your mind.  I'm in no hurry.  Night's coming 

on, and if I don't sleep here, I shall not go far.  Twenty pounds!  

Consider of it, ma'am, for twenty minutes; give each pound a 

minute; that's a fair allowance.  I'll enjoy the air the while, 

which is very mild and pleasant in these parts.'



With these words he groped his way to the door, carrying his chair 

with him.  Then seating himself, under a spreading honeysuckle, and 

stretching his legs across the threshold so that no person could 

pass in or out without his knowledge, he took from his pocket a 

pipe, flint, steel and tinder-box, and began to smoke.  It was a 

lovely evening, of that gentle kind, and at that time of year, when 

the twilight is most beautiful.  Pausing now and then to let his 

smoke curl slowly off, and to sniff the grateful fragrance of the 

flowers, he sat there at his ease--as though the cottage were his 

proper dwelling, and he had held undisputed possession of it all 

his life--waiting for the widow's answer and for Barnaby's return.
