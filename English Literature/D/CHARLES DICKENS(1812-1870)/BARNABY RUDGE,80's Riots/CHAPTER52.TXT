A mob is usually a creature of very mysterious existence, 

particularly in a large city.  Where it comes from or whither it 

goes, few men can tell.  Assembling and dispersing with equal 

suddenness, it is as difficult to follow to its various sources as 

the sea itself; nor does the parallel stop here, for the ocean is 

not more fickle and uncertain, more terrible when roused, more 

unreasonable, or more cruel.



The people who were boisterous at Westminster upon the Friday 

morning, and were eagerly bent upon the work of devastation in Duke 

Street and Warwick Street at night, were, in the mass, the same.  

Allowing for the chance accessions of which any crowd is morally 

sure in a town where there must always be a large number of idle 

and profligate persons, one and the same mob was at both places.  

Yet they spread themselves in various directions when they 

dispersed in the afternoon, made no appointment for reassembling, 

had no definite purpose or design, and indeed, for anything they 

knew, were scattered beyond the hope of future union.



At The Boot, which, as has been shown, was in a manner the head-

quarters of the rioters, there were not, upon this Friday night, a 

dozen people.  Some slept in the stable and outhouses, some in the 

common room, some two or three in beds.  The rest were in their 

usual homes or haunts.  Perhaps not a score in all lay in the 

adjacent fields and lanes, and under haystacks, or near the warmth 

of brick-kilns, who had not their accustomed place of rest beneath 

the open sky.  As to the public ways within the town, they had 

their ordinary nightly occupants, and no others; the usual amount 

of vice and wretchedness, but no more.



The experience of one evening, however, had taught the reckless 

leaders of disturbance, that they had but to show themselves in the 

streets, to be immediately surrounded by materials which they could 

only have kept together when their aid was not required, at great 

risk, expense, and trouble.  Once possessed of this secret, they 

were as confident as if twenty thousand men, devoted to their will, 

had been encamped about them, and assumed a confidence which could 

not have been surpassed, though that had really been the case.  All 

day, Saturday, they remained quiet.  On Sunday, they rather studied 

how to keep their men within call, and in full hope, than to follow 

out, by any fierce measure, their first day's proceedings.



'I hope,' said Dennis, as, with a loud yawn, he raised his body 

from a heap of straw on which he had been sleeping, and supporting 

his head upon his hand, appealed to Hugh on Sunday morning, 'that 

Muster Gashford allows some rest?  Perhaps he'd have us at work 

again already, eh?'



'It's not his way to let matters drop, you may be sure of that,' 

growled Hugh in answer.  'I'm in no humour to stir yet, though.  

I'm as stiff as a dead body, and as full of ugly scratches as if I 

had been fighting all day yesterday with wild cats.'



'You've so much enthusiasm, that's it,' said Dennis, looking with 

great admiration at the uncombed head, matted beard, and torn hands 

and face of the wild figure before him; 'you're such a devil of a 

fellow.  You hurt yourself a hundred times more than you need, 

because you will be foremost in everything, and will do more than 

the rest.'



'For the matter of that,' returned Hugh, shaking back his ragged 

hair and glancing towards the door of the stable in which they lay; 

'there's one yonder as good as me.  What did I tell you about him?  

Did I say he was worth a dozen, when you doubted him?'



Mr Dennis rolled lazily over upon his breast, and resting his chin 

upon his hand in imitation of the attitude in which Hugh lay, said, 

as he too looked towards the door:



'Ay, ay, you knew him, brother, you knew him.  But who'd suppose to 

look at that chap now, that he could be the man he is!  Isn't it a 

thousand cruel pities, brother, that instead of taking his nat'ral 

rest and qualifying himself for further exertions in this here 

honourable cause, he should be playing at soldiers like a boy?  And 

his cleanliness too!' said Mr Dennis, who certainly had no reason 

to entertain a fellow feeling with anybody who was particular on 

that score; 'what weaknesses he's guilty of; with respect to his 

cleanliness!  At five o'clock this morning, there he was at the 

pump, though any one would think he had gone through enough, the 

day before yesterday, to be pretty fast asleep at that time.  But 

no--when I woke for a minute or two, there he was at the pump, and 

if you'd seen him sticking them peacock's feathers into his hat 

when he'd done washing--ah! I'm sorry he's such a imperfect 

character, but the best on us is incomplete in some pint of view or 

another.'



The subject of this dialogue and of these concluding remarks, which 

were uttered in a tone of philosophical meditation, was, as the 

reader will have divined, no other than Barnaby, who, with his flag 

in hand, stood sentry in the little patch of sunlight at the 

distant door, or walked to and fro outside, singing softly to 

himself; and keeping time to the music of some clear church bells.  

Whether he stood still, leaning with both hands on the flagstaff, 

or, bearing it upon his shoulder, paced slowly up and down, the 

careful arrangement of his poor dress, and his erect and lofty 

bearing, showed how high a sense he had of the great importance of 

his trust, and how happy and how proud it made him.  To Hugh and 

his companion, who lay in a dark corner of the gloomy shed, he, and 

the sunlight, and the peaceful Sabbath sound to which he made 

response, seemed like a bright picture framed by the door, and set 

off by the stable's blackness.  The whole formed such a contrast to 

themselves, as they lay wallowing, like some obscene animals, in 

their squalor and wickedness on the two heaps of straw, that for a 

few moments they looked on without speaking, and felt almost 

ashamed.



'Ah!'said Hugh at length, carrying it off with a laugh: 'He's a 

rare fellow is Barnaby, and can do more, with less rest, or meat, 

or drink, than any of us.  As to his soldiering, I put him on duty 

there.'



'Then there was a object in it, and a proper good one too, I'll be 

sworn,' retorted Dennis with a broad grin, and an oath of the same 

quality.  'What was it, brother?'



'Why, you see,' said Hugh, crawling a little nearer to him, 'that 

our noble captain yonder, came in yesterday morning rather the 

worse for liquor, and was--like you and me--ditto last night.'



Dennis looked to where Simon Tappertit lay coiled upon a truss of 

hay, snoring profoundly, and nodded.



'And our noble captain,' continued Hugh with another laugh, 'our 

noble captain and I, have planned for to-morrow a roaring 

expedition, with good profit in it.'



'Again the Papists?' asked Dennis, rubbing his hands.



'Ay, against the Papists--against one of 'em at least, that some of 

us, and I for one, owe a good heavy grudge to.'



'Not Muster Gashford's friend that he spoke to us about in my 

house, eh?' said Dennis, brimfull of pleasant expectation.



'The same man,' said Hugh.



'That's your sort,' cried Mr Dennis, gaily shaking hands with him, 

'that's the kind of game.  Let's have revenges and injuries, and 

all that, and we shall get on twice as fast.  Now you talk, 

indeed!'



'Ha ha ha!  The captain,' added Hugh, 'has thoughts of carrying off 

a woman in the bustle, and--ha ha ha!--and so have I!'



Mr Dennis received this part of the scheme with a wry face, 

observing that as a general principle he objected to women 

altogether, as being unsafe and slippery persons on whom there was 

no calculating with any certainty, and who were never in the same 

mind for four-and-twenty hours at a stretch.  He might have 

expatiated on this suggestive theme at much greater length, but 

that it occurred to him to ask what connection existed between the 

proposed expedition and Barnaby's being posted at the stable-door 

as sentry; to which Hugh cautiously replied in these words:



'Why, the people we mean to visit, were friends of his, once upon a 

time, and I know that much of him to feel pretty sure that if he 

thought we were going to do them any harm, he'd be no friend to our 

side, but would lend a ready hand to the other.  So I've persuaded 

him (for I know him of old) that Lord George has picked him out to 

guard this place to-morrow while we're away, and that it's a great 

honour--and so he's on duty now, and as proud of it as if he was a 

general.  Ha ha!  What do you say to me for a careful man as well 

as a devil of a one?'



Mr Dennis exhausted himself in compliments, and then added,



'But about the expedition itself--'



'About that,' said Hugh, 'you shall hear all particulars from me 

and the great captain conjointly and both together--for see, he's 

waking up.  Rouse yourself, lion-heart.  Ha ha!  Put a good face 

upon it, and drink again.  Another hair of the dog that bit you, 

captain!  Call for drink!  There's enough of gold and silver cups 

and candlesticks buried underneath my bed,' he added, rolling back 

the straw, and pointing to where the ground was newly turned, 'to 

pay for it, if it was a score of casks full.  Drink, captain!'



Mr Tappertit received these jovial promptings with a very bad 

grace, being much the worse, both in mind and body, for his two 

nights of debauch, and but indifferently able to stand upon his 

legs.  With Hugh's assistance, however, he contrived to stagger to 

the pump; and having refreshed himself with an abundant draught of 

cold water, and a copious shower of the same refreshing liquid on 

his head and face, he ordered some rum and milk to be served; and 

upon that innocent beverage and some biscuits and cheese made a 

pretty hearty meal.  That done, he disposed himself in an easy 

attitude on the ground beside his two companions (who were 

carousing after their own tastes), and proceeded to enlighten Mr 

Dennis in reference to to-morrow's project.



That their conversation was an interesting one, was rendered 

manifest by its length, and by the close attention of all three.  

That it was not of an oppressively grave character, but was 

enlivened by various pleasantries arising out of the subject, was 

clear from their loud and frequent roars of laughter, which 

startled Barnaby on his post, and made him wonder at their levity.  

But he was not summoned to join them, until they had eaten, and 

drunk, and slept, and talked together for some hours; not, indeed, 

until the twilight; when they informed him that they were about to 

make a slight demonstration in the streets--just to keep the 

people's hands in, as it was Sunday night, and the public might 

otherwise be disappointed--and that he was free to accompany them 

if he would.



Without the slightest preparation, saving that they carried clubs 

and wore the blue cockade, they sallied out into the streets; and, 

with no more settled design than that of doing as much mischief as 

they could, paraded them at random.  Their numbers rapidly 

increasing, they soon divided into parties; and agreeing to meet 

by-and-by, in the fields near Welbeck Street, scoured the town in 

various directions.  The largest body, and that which augmented 

with the greatest rapidity, was the one to which Hugh and Barnaby 

belonged.  This took its way towards Moorfields, where there was a 

rich chapel, and in which neighbourhood several Catholic families 

were known to reside.



Beginning with the private houses so occupied, they broke open the 

doors and windows; and while they destroyed the furniture and left 

but the bare walls, made a sharp search for tools and engines of 

destruction, such as hammers, pokers, axes, saws, and such like 

instruments.  Many of the rioters made belts of cord, of 

handkerchiefs, or any material they found at hand, and wore these 

weapons as openly as pioneers upon a field-day.  There was not the 

least disguise or concealment--indeed, on this night, very little 

excitement or hurry.  From the chapels, they tore down and took 

away the very altars, benches, pulpits, pews, and flooring; from 

the dwelling-houses, the very wainscoting and stairs.  This Sunday 

evening's recreation they pursued like mere workmen who had a 

certain task to do, and did it.  Fifty resolute men might have 

turned them at any moment; a single company of soldiers could have 

scattered them like dust; but no man interposed, no authority 

restrained them, and, except by the terrified persons who fled from 

their approach, they were as little heeded as if they were pursuing 

their lawful occupations with the utmost sobriety and good 

conduct.



In the same manner, they marched to the place of rendezvous agreed 

upon, made great fires in the fields, and reserving the most 

valuable of their spoils, burnt the rest.  Priestly garments, 

images of saints, rich stuffs and ornaments, altar-furniture and 

household goods, were cast into the flames, and shed a glare on the 

whole country round; but they danced and howled, and roared about 

these fires till they were tired, and were never for an instant 

checked.



As the main body filed off from this scene of action, and passed 

down Welbeck Street, they came upon Gashford, who had been a 

witness of their proceedings, and was walking stealthily along the 

pavement.  Keeping up with him, and yet not seeming to speak, Hugh 

muttered in his ear:



'Is this better, master?'



'No,' said Gashford.  'It is not.'



'What would you have?' said Hugh.  'Fevers are never at their 

height at once.  They must get on by degrees.'



'I would have you,' said Gashford, pinching his arm with such 

malevolence that his nails seemed to meet in the skin; 'I would 

have you put some meaning into your work.  Fools!  Can you make no 

better bonfires than of rags and scraps?  Can you burn nothing 

whole?'



'A little patience, master,' said Hugh.  'Wait but a few hours, and 

you shall see.  Look for a redness in the sky, to-morrow night.'



With that, he fell back into his place beside Barnaby; and when the 

secretary looked after him, both were lost in the crowd.
