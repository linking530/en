Little thinking of the plan for his happy settlement in life which 

had suggested itself to the teeming brain of his provident 

commander, Hugh made no pause until Saint Dunstan's giants struck 

the hour above him, when he worked the handle of a pump which stood 

hard by, with great vigour, and thrusting his head under the spout, 

let the water gush upon him until a little stream ran down from 

every uncombed hair, and he was wet to the waist.  Considerably 

refreshed by this ablution, both in mind and body, and almost 

sobered for the time, he dried himself as he best could; then 

crossed the road, and plied the knocker of the Middle Temple gate.



The night-porter looked through a small grating in the portal with 

a surly eye, and cried 'Halloa!' which greeting Hugh returned in 

kind, and bade him open quickly.



'We don't sell beer here,' cried the man; 'what else do you want?'



'To come in,' Hugh replied, with a kick at the door.



'Where to go?'



'Paper Buildings.'



'Whose chambers?'



'Sir John Chester's.'  Each of which answers, he emphasised with 

another kick.



After a little growling on the other side, the gate was opened, and 

he passed in: undergoing a close inspection from the porter as he 

did so.



'YOU wanting Sir John, at this time of night!' said the man.



'Ay!' said Hugh.  'I!  What of that?'



'Why, I must go with you and see that you do, for I don't believe 

it.'



'Come along then.'



Eyeing him with suspicious looks, the man, with key and lantern, 

walked on at his side, and attended him to Sir John Chester's door, 

at which Hugh gave one knock, that echoed through the dark 

staircase like a ghostly summons, and made the dull light tremble 

in the drowsy lamp.



'Do you think he wants me now?' said Hugh.



Before the man had time to answer, a footstep was heard within, a 

light appeared, and Sir John, in his dressing-gown and slippers, 

opened the door.



'I ask your pardon, Sir John,' said the porter, pulling off his 

hat.  'Here's a young man says he wants to speak to you.  It's late 

for strangers.  I thought it best to see that all was right.'



'Aha!' cried Sir John, raising his eyebrows.  'It's you, 

messenger, is it?  Go in.  Quite right, friend.  I commend your 

prudence highly.  Thank you.  God bless you.  Good night.'



To be commended, thanked, God-blessed, and bade good night by one 

who carried 'Sir' before his name, and wrote himself M.P. to boot, 

was something for a porter.  He withdrew with much humility and 

reverence.  Sir John followed his late visitor into the dressing-

room, and sitting in his easy-chair before the fire, and moving it 

so that he could see him as he stood, hat in hand, beside the door, 

looked at him from head to foot.



The old face, calm and pleasant as ever; the complexion, quite 

juvenile in its bloom and clearness; the same smile; the wonted 

precision and elegance of dress; the white, well-ordered teeth; the 

delicate hands; the composed and quiet manner; everything as it 

used to be: no mark of age or passion, envy, hate, or discontent: 

all unruffled and serene, and quite delightful to behold.



He wrote himself M.P.--but how?  Why, thus.  It was a proud family--

more proud, indeed, than wealthy.  He had stood in danger of 

arrest; of bailiffs, and a jail--a vulgar jail, to which the common 

people with small incomes went.  Gentlemen of ancient houses have 

no privilege of exemption from such cruel laws--unless they are of 

one great house, and then they have.  A proud man of his stock and 

kindred had the means of sending him there.  He offered--not indeed 

to pay his debts, but to let him sit for a close borough until his 

own son came of age, which, if he lived, would come to pass in 

twenty years.  It was quite as good as an Insolvent Act, and 

infinitely more genteel.  So Sir John Chester was a member of 

Parliament.



But how Sir John?  Nothing so simple, or so easy.  One touch with a 

sword of state, and the transformation was effected.  John Chester, 

Esquire, M.P., attended court--went up with an address--headed a 

deputation.  Such elegance of manner, so many graces of deportment, 

such powers of conversation, could never pass unnoticed.  Mr was 

too common for such merit.  A man so gentlemanly should have been--

but Fortune is capricious--born a Duke: just as some dukes should 

have been born labourers.  He caught the fancy of the king, knelt 

down a grub, and rose a butterfly.  John Chester, Esquire, was 

knighted and became Sir John.



'I thought when you left me this evening, my esteemed 

acquaintance,' said Sir John after a pretty long silence, 'that you 

intended to return with all despatch?'



'So I did, master.'



'And so you have?' he retorted, glancing at his watch.  'Is that 

what you would say?'



Instead of replying, Hugh changed the leg on which he leant, 

shuffled his cap from one hand to the other, looked at the ground, 

the wall, the ceiling, and finally at Sir John himself; before 

whose pleasant face he lowered his eyes again, and fixed them on 

the floor.



'And how have you been employing yourself in the meanwhile?' quoth 

Sir John, lazily crossing his legs.  'Where have you been? what 

harm have you been doing?'



'No harm at all, master,' growled Hugh, with humility.  'I have 

only done as you ordered.'



'As I WHAT?' returned Sir John.



'Well then,' said Hugh uneasily, 'as you advised, or said I ought, 

or said I might, or said that you would do, if you was me.  Don't 

be so hard upon me, master.'



Something like an expression of triumph in the perfect control he 

had established over this rough instrument appeared in the knight's 

face for an instant; but it vanished directly, as he said--paring 

his nails while speaking:



'When you say I ordered you, my good fellow, you imply that I 

directed you to do something for me--something I wanted done--

something for my own ends and purposes--you see?  Now I am sure I 

needn't enlarge upon the extreme absurdity of such an idea, however 

unintentional; so please--' and here he turned his eyes upon him--

'to be more guarded.  Will you?'



'I meant to give you no offence,' said Hugh.  'I don't know what to 

say.  You catch me up so very short.'



'You will be caught up much shorter, my good friend--infinitely 

shorter--one of these days, depend upon it,' replied his patron 

calmly.  'By-the-bye, instead of wondering why you have been so 

long, my wonder should be why you came at all.  Why did you?'



'You know, master,' said Hugh, 'that I couldn't read the bill I 

found, and that supposing it to be something particular from the 

way it was wrapped up, I brought it here.'



'And could you ask no one else to read it, Bruin?' said Sir John.



'No one that I could trust with secrets, master.  Since Barnaby 

Rudge was lost sight of for good and all--and that's five years 

ago--I haven't talked with any one but you.'



'You have done me honour, I am sure.'



'I have come to and fro, master, all through that time, when there 

was anything to tell, because I knew that you'd be angry with me if 

I stayed away,' said Hugh, blurting the words out, after an 

embarrassed silence; 'and because I wished to please you if I 

could, and not to have you go against me.  There.  That's the true 

reason why I came to-night.  You know that, master, I am sure.'



'You are a specious fellow,' returned Sir John, fixing his eyes 

upon him, 'and carry two faces under your hood, as well as the 

best.  Didn't you give me in this room, this evening, any other 

reason; no dislike of anybody who has slighted you lately, on all 

occasions, abused you, treated you with rudeness; acted towards 

you, more as if you were a mongrel dog than a man like himself?'



'To be sure I did!' cried Hugh, his passion rising, as the other 

meant it should; 'and I say it all over now, again.  I'd do 

anything to have some revenge on him--anything.  And when you told 

me that he and all the Catholics would suffer from those who joined 

together under that handbill, I said I'd make one of 'em, if their 

master was the devil himself.  I AM one of 'em.  See whether I am 

as good as my word and turn out to be among the foremost, or no.  I 

mayn't have much head, master, but I've head enough to remember 

those that use me ill.  You shall see, and so shall he, and so 

shall hundreds more, how my spirit backs me when the time comes.  

My bark is nothing to my bite.  Some that I know had better have a 

wild lion among 'em than me, when I am fairly loose--they had!'



The knight looked at him with a smile of far deeper meaning than 

ordinary; and pointing to the old cupboard, followed him with his 

eyes while he filled and drank a glass of liquor; and smiled when 

his back was turned, with deeper meaning yet.



'You are in a blustering mood, my friend,' he said, when Hugh 

confronted him again.



'Not I, master!' cried Hugh.  'I don't say half I mean.  I can't.  

I haven't got the gift.  There are talkers enough among us; I'll be 

one of the doers.'



'Oh! you have joined those fellows then?' said Sir John, with an 

air of most profound indifference.



'Yes.  I went up to the house you told me of; and got put down upon 

the muster.  There was another man there, named Dennis--'



'Dennis, eh!' cried Sir John, laughing.  'Ay, ay! a pleasant 

fellow, I believe?'



'A roaring dog, master--one after my own heart--hot upon the matter 

too--red hot.'



'So I have heard,' replied Sir John, carelessly.  'You don't happen 

to know his trade, do you?'



'He wouldn't say,' cried Hugh.  'He keeps it secret.'



'Ha ha!' laughed Sir John.  'A strange fancy--a weakness with some 

persons--you'll know it one day, I dare swear.'



'We're intimate already,' said Hugh.



'Quite natural!  And have been drinking together, eh?' pursued Sir 

John.  'Did you say what place you went to in company, when you 

left Lord George's?'



Hugh had not said or thought of saying, but he told him; and this 

inquiry being followed by a long train of questions, he related all 

that had passed both in and out of doors, the kind of people he had 

seen, their numbers, state of feeling, mode of conversation, 

apparent expectations and intentions.  His questioning was so 

artfully contrived, that he seemed even in his own eyes to 

volunteer all this information rather than to have it wrested from 

him; and he was brought to this state of feeling so naturally, that 

when Mr Chester yawned at length and declared himself quite wearied 

out, he made a rough kind of excuse for having talked so much.



'There--get you gone,' said Sir John, holding the door open in his 

hand.  'You have made a pretty evening's work.  I told you not to 

do this.  You may get into trouble.  You'll have an opportunity of 

revenging yourself on your proud friend Haredale, though, and for 

that, you'd hazard anything, I suppose?'



'I would,' retorted Hugh, stopping in his passage out and looking 

back; 'but what do I risk!  What do I stand a chance of losing, 

master?  Friends, home?  A fig for 'em all; I have none; they are 

nothing to me.  Give me a good scuffle; let me pay off old scores 

in a bold riot where there are men to stand by me; and then use me 

as you like--it don't matter much to me what the end is!'



'What have you done with that paper?' said Sir John.



'I have it here, master.'



'Drop it again as you go along; it's as well not to keep such 

things about you.'



Hugh nodded, and touching his cap with an air of as much respect as 

he could summon up, departed.



Sir John, fastening the doors behind him, went back to his 

dressing-room, and sat down once again before the fire, at which 

he gazed for a long time, in earnest meditation.



'This happens fortunately,' he said, breaking into a smile, 'and 

promises well.  Let me see.  My relative and I, who are the most 

Protestant fellows in the world, give our worst wishes to the Roman 

Catholic cause; and to Saville, who introduces their bill, I have 

a personal objection besides; but as each of us has himself for 

the first article in his creed, we cannot commit ourselves by 

joining with a very extravagant madman, such as this Gordon most 

undoubtedly is.  Now really, to foment his disturbances in secret, 

through the medium of such a very apt instrument as my savage 

friend here, may further our real ends; and to express at all 

becoming seasons, in moderate and polite terms, a disapprobation of 

his proceedings, though we agree with him in principle, will 

certainly be to gain a character for honesty and uprightness of 

purpose, which cannot fail to do us infinite service, and to raise 

us into some importance.  Good!  So much for public grounds.  As to 

private considerations, I confess that if these vagabonds WOULD 

make some riotous demonstration (which does not appear impossible), 

and WOULD inflict some little chastisement on Haredale as a not 

inactive man among his sect, it would be extremely agreeable to my 

feelings, and would amuse me beyond measure.  Good again!  Perhaps 

better!'



When he came to this point, he took a pinch of snuff; then 

beginning slowly to undress, he resumed his meditations, by saying 

with a smile:



'I fear, I DO fear exceedingly, that my friend is following fast in 

the footsteps of his mother.  His intimacy with Mr Dennis is very 

ominous.  But I have no doubt he must have come to that end any 

way.  If I lend him a helping hand, the only difference is, that he 

may, upon the whole, possibly drink a few gallons, or puncheons, or 

hogsheads, less in this life than he otherwise would.  It's no 

business of mine.  It's a matter of very small importance!'



So he took another pinch of snuff, and went to bed.
