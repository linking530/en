PREFACE



The late Mr Waterton having, some time ago, expressed his opinion 

that ravens are gradually becoming extinct in England, I offered 

the few following words about my experience of these birds.



The raven in this story is a compound of two great originals, of 

whom I was, at different times, the proud possessor.  The first was 

in the bloom of his youth, when he was discovered in a modest 

retirement in London, by a friend of mine, and given to me.  He had 

from the first, as Sir Hugh Evans says of Anne Page, 'good gifts', 

which he improved by study and attention in a most exemplary 

manner.  He slept in a stable--generally on horseback--and so 

terrified a Newfoundland dog by his preternatural sagacity, that he 

has been known, by the mere superiority of his genius, to walk off 

unmolested with the dog's dinner, from before his face.  He was 

rapidly rising in acquirements and virtues, when, in an evil hour, 

his stable was newly painted.  He observed the workmen closely, 

saw that they were careful of the paint, and immediately burned to 

possess it.  On their going to dinner, he ate up all they had left 

behind, consisting of a pound or two of white lead; and this 

youthful indiscretion terminated in death.



While I was yet inconsolable for his loss, another friend of mine 

in Yorkshire discovered an older and more gifted raven at a village 

public-house, which he prevailed upon the landlord to part with for 

a consideration, and sent up to me.  The first act of this Sage, 

was, to administer to the effects of his predecessor, by 

disinterring all the cheese and halfpence he had buried in the 

garden--a work of immense labour and research, to which he devoted 

all the energies of his mind.  When he had achieved this task, he 

applied himself to the acquisition of stable language, in which he 

soon became such an adept, that he would perch outside my window 

and drive imaginary horses with great skill, all day.  Perhaps 

even I never saw him at his best, for his former master sent his 

duty with him, 'and if I wished the bird to come out very strong, 

would I be so good as to show him a drunken man'--which I never 

did, having (unfortunately) none but sober people at hand.



But I could hardly have respected him more, whatever the 

stimulating influences of this sight might have been.  He had not 

the least respect, I am sorry to say, for me in return, or for 

anybody but the cook; to whom he was attached--but only, I fear, as 

a Policeman might have been.  Once, I met him unexpectedly, about 

half-a-mile from my house, walking down the middle of a public 

street, attended by a pretty large crowd, and spontaneously 

exhibiting the whole of his accomplishments.  His gravity under 

those trying circumstances, I can never forget, nor the 

extraordinary gallantry with which, refusing to be brought home, he 

defended himself behind a pump, until overpowered by numbers.  It 

may have been that he was too bright a genius to live long, or it 

may have been that he took some pernicious substance into his bill, 

and thence into his maw--which is not improbable, seeing that he 

new-pointed the greater part of the garden-wall by digging out the 

mortar, broke countless squares of glass by scraping away the putty 

all round the frames, and tore up and swallowed, in splinters, the 

greater part of a wooden staircase of six steps and a landing--but 

after some three years he too was taken ill, and died before the 

kitchen fire.  He kept his eye to the last upon the meat as it 

roasted, and suddenly.  turned over on his back with a sepulchral 

cry of 'Cuckoo!'  Since then I have been ravenless.



No account of the Gordon Riots having been to my knowledge 

introduced into any Work of Fiction, and the subject presenting 

very extraordinary and remarkable features, I was led to project 

this Tale.



It is unnecessary to say, that those shameful tumults, while they 

reflect indelible disgrace upon the time in which they occurred, 

and all who had act or part in them, teach a good lesson.  That 

what we falsely call a religious cry is easily raised by men who 

have no religion, and who in their daily practice set at nought the 

commonest principles of right and wrong; that it is begotten of 

intolerance and persecution; that it is senseless, besotted, 

inveterate and unmerciful; all History teaches us.  But perhaps we 

do not know it in our hearts too well, to profit by even so humble 

an example as the 'No Popery' riots of Seventeen Hundred and Eighty.



However imperfectly those disturbances are set forth in the 

following pages, they are impartially painted by one who has no 

sympathy with the Romish Church, though he acknowledges, as most 

men do, some esteemed friends among the followers of its creed.



In the description of the principal outrages, reference has been 

had to the best authorities of that time, such as they are; the 

account given in this Tale, of all the main features of the Riots, 

is substantially correct.



Mr Dennis's allusions to the flourishing condition of his trade in 

those days, have their foundation in Truth, and not in the 

Author's fancy.  Any file of old Newspapers, or odd volume of the 

Annual Register, will prove this with terrible ease.



Even the case of Mary Jones, dwelt upon with so much pleasure by 

the same character, is no effort of invention.  The facts were 

stated, exactly as they are stated here, in the House of Commons.  

Whether they afforded as much entertainment to the merry gentlemen 

assembled there, as some other most affecting circumstances of a 

similar nature mentioned by Sir Samuel Romilly, is not recorded.



That the case of Mary Jones may speak the more emphatically for 

itself, I subjoin it, as related by SIR WILLIAM MEREDITH in a 

speech in Parliament, 'on Frequent Executions', made in 1777.



'Under this act,' the Shop-lifting Act, 'one Mary Jones was 

executed, whose case I shall just mention; it was at the time when 

press warrants were issued, on the alarm about Falkland Islands.  

The woman's husband was pressed, their goods seized for some debts 

of his, and she, with two small children, turned into the streets 

a-begging.  It is a circumstance not to be forgotten, that she was 

very young (under nineteen), and most remarkably handsome.  She 

went to a linen-draper's shop, took some coarse linen off the 

counter, and slipped it under her cloak; the shopman saw her, and 

she laid it down: for this she was hanged.  Her defence was (I have 

the trial in my pocket), "that she had lived in credit, and wanted 

for nothing, till a press-gang came and stole her husband from her; 

but since then, she had no bed to lie on; nothing to give her 

children to eat; and they were almost naked; and perhaps she might 

have done something wrong, for she hardly knew what she did."  The 

parish officers testified the truth of this story; but it seems, 

there had been a good deal of shop-lifting about Ludgate; an 

example was thought necessary; and this woman was hanged for the 

comfort and satisfaction of shopkeepers in Ludgate Street.  When 

brought to receive sentence, she behaved in such a frantic manner, 

as proved her mind to he in a distracted and desponding state; and 

the child was sucking at her breast when she set out for Tyburn.'
