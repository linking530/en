During the whole course of the terrible scene which was now at its 

height, one man in the jail suffered a degree of fear and mental 

torment which had no parallel in the endurance, even of those who 

lay under sentence of death.



When the rioters first assembled before the building, the murderer 

was roused from sleep--if such slumbers as his may have that 

blessed name--by the roar of voices, and the struggling of a great 

crowd.  He started up as these sounds met his ear, and, sitting on 

his bedstead, listened.



After a short interval of silence the noise burst out again.  Still 

listening attentively, he made out, in course of time, that the 

jail was besieged by a furious multitude.  His guilty conscience 

instantly arrayed these men against himself, and brought the fear 

upon him that he would be singled out, and torn to pieces.



Once impressed with the terror of this conceit, everything tended 

to confirm and strengthen it.  His double crime, the circumstances 

under which it had been committed, the length of time that had 

elapsed, and its discovery in spite of all, made him, as it were, 

the visible object of the Almighty's wrath.  In all the crime and 

vice and moral gloom of the great pest-house of the capital, he 

stood alone, marked and singled out by his great guilt, a Lucifer 

among the devils.  The other prisoners were a host, hiding and 

sheltering each other--a crowd like that without the walls.  He was 

one man against the whole united concourse; a single, solitary, 

lonely man, from whom the very captives in the jail fell off and 

shrunk appalled.



It might be that the intelligence of his capture having been 

bruited abroad, they had come there purposely to drag him out and 

kill him in the street; or it might be that they were the rioters, 

and, in pursuance of an old design, had come to sack the prison.  

But in either case he had no belief or hope that they would spare 

him.  Every shout they raised, and every sound they made, was a 

blow upon his heart.  As the attack went on, he grew more wild and 

frantic in his terror: tried to pull away the bars that guarded the 

chimney and prevented him from climbing up: called loudly on the 

turnkeys to cluster round the cell and save him from the fury of 

the rabble; or put him in some dungeon underground, no matter of 

what depth, how dark it was, or loathsome, or beset with rats and 

creeping things, so that it hid him and was hard to find.



But no one came, or answered him.  Fearful, even while he cried to 

them, of attracting attention, he was silent.  By and bye, he saw, 

as he looked from his grated window, a strange glimmering on the 

stone walls and pavement of the yard.  It was feeble at first, and 

came and went, as though some officers with torches were passing to 

and fro upon the roof of the prison.  Soon it reddened, and lighted 

brands came whirling down, spattering the ground with fire, and 

burning sullenly in corners.  One rolled beneath a wooden bench, 

and set it in a blaze; another caught a water-spout, and so went 

climbing up the wall, leaving a long straight track of fire behind 

it.  After a time, a slow thick shower of burning fragments, from 

some upper portion of the prison which was blazing nigh, began to 

fall before his door.  Remembering that it opened outwards, he knew 

that every spark which fell upon the heap, and in the act lost its 

bright life, and died an ugly speck of dust and rubbish, helped to 

entomb him in a living grave.  Still, though the jail resounded 

with shrieks and cries for help,--though the fire bounded up as if 

each separate flame had had a tiger's life, and roared as though, 

in every one, there were a hungry voice--though the heat began to 

grow intense, and the air suffocating, and the clamour without 

increased, and the danger of his situation even from one merciless 

element was every moment more extreme,--still he was afraid to 

raise his voice again, lest the crowd should break in, and should, 

of their own ears or from the information given them by the other 

prisoners, get the clue to his place of confinement.  Thus fearful 

alike, of those within the prison and of those without; of noise 

and silence; light and darkness; of being released, and being left 

there to die; he was so tortured and tormented, that nothing man 

has ever done to man in the horrible caprice of power and cruelty, 

exceeds his self-inflicted punishment.



Now, now, the door was down.  Now they came rushing through the 

jail, calling to each other in the vaulted passages; clashing the 

iron gates dividing yard from yard; beating at the doors of cells 

and wards; wrenching off bolts and locks and bars; tearing down the 

door-posts to get men out; endeavouring to drag them by main force 

through gaps and windows where a child could scarcely pass; 

whooping and yelling without a moment's rest; and running through 

the heat and flames as if they were cased in metal.  By their legs, 

their arms, the hair upon their heads, they dragged the prisoners 

out.  Some threw themselves upon the captives as they got towards 

the door, and tried to file away their irons; some danced about 

them with a frenzied joy, and rent their clothes, and were ready, 

as it seemed, to tear them limb from limb.  Now a party of a dozen 

men came darting through the yard into which the murderer cast 

fearful glances from his darkened window; dragging a prisoner along 

the ground whose dress they had nearly torn from his body in their 

mad eagerness to set him free, and who was bleeding and senseless 

in their hands.  Now a score of prisoners ran to and fro, who had 

lost themselves in the intricacies of the prison, and were so 

bewildered with the noise and glare that they knew not where to 

turn or what to do, and still cried out for help, as loudly as 

before.  Anon some famished wretch whose theft had been a loaf of 

bread, or scrap of butcher's meat, came skulking past, barefooted--

going slowly away because that jail, his house, was burning; not 

because he had any other, or had friends to meet, or old haunts to 

revisit, or any liberty to gain, but liberty to starve and die.  

And then a knot of highwaymen went trooping by, conducted by the 

friends they had among the crowd, who muffled their fetters as they 

went along, with handkerchiefs and bands of hay, and wrapped them 

in coats and cloaks, and gave them drink from bottles, and held it 

to their lips, because of their handcuffs which there was no time 

to remove.  All this, and Heaven knows how much more, was done 

amidst a noise, a hurry, and distraction, like nothing that we know 

of, even in our dreams; which seemed for ever on the rise, and 

never to decrease for the space of a single instant.



He was still looking down from his window upon these things, when a 

band of men with torches, ladders, axes, and many kinds of weapons, 

poured into the yard, and hammering at his door, inquired if there 

were any prisoner within.  He left the window when he saw them 

coming, and drew back into the remotest corner of the cell; but 

although he returned them no answer, they had a fancy that some one 

was inside, for they presently set ladders against it, and began to 

tear away the bars at the casement; not only that, indeed, but with 

pickaxes to hew down the very stones in the wall.



As soon as they had made a breach at the window, large enough for 

the admission of a man's head, one of them thrust in a torch and 

looked all round the room.  He followed this man's gaze until it 

rested on himself, and heard him demand why he had not answered, 

but made him no reply.



In the general surprise and wonder, they were used to this; without 

saying anything more, they enlarged the breach until it was large 

enough to admit the body of a man, and then came dropping down upon 

the floor, one after another, until the cell was full.  They caught 


him up among them, handed him to the window, and those who stood 

upon the ladders passed him down upon the pavement of the yard.  

Then the rest came out, one after another, and, bidding him fly, 

and lose no time, or the way would be choked up, hurried away to 

rescue others.



It seemed not a minute's work from first to last.  He staggered to 

his feet, incredulous of what had happened, when the yard was 

filled again, and a crowd rushed on, hurrying Barnaby among them.  

In another minute--not so much: another minute! the same instant, 

with no lapse or interval between!--he and his son were being 

passed from hand to hand, through the dense crowd in the street, 

and were glancing backward at a burning pile which some one said 

was Newgate.



From the moment of their first entrance into the prison, the crowd 

dispersed themselves about it, and swarmed into every chink and 

crevice, as if they had a perfect acquaintance with its innermost 

parts, and bore in their minds an exact plan of the whole.  For 

this immediate knowledge of the place, they were, no doubt, in a 

great degree, indebted to the hangman, who stood in the lobby, 

directing some to go this way, some that, and some the other; and 

who materially assisted in bringing about the wonderful rapidity 

with which the release of the prisoners was effected.



But this functionary of the law reserved one important piece of 

intelligence, and kept it snugly to himself.  When he had issued 

his instructions relative to every other part of the building, and 

the mob were dispersed from end to end, and busy at their work, he 

took a bundle of keys from a kind of cupboard in the wall, and 

going by a kind of passage near the chapel (it joined the governors 

house, and was then on fire), betook himself to the condemned 

cells, which were a series of small, strong, dismal rooms, opening 

on a low gallery, guarded, at the end at which he entered, by a 

strong iron wicket, and at its opposite extremity by two doors and 

a thick grate.  Having double locked the wicket, and assured 

himself that the other entrances were well secured, he sat down on 

a bench in the gallery, and sucked the head of his stick with the 

utmost complacency, tranquillity, and contentment.



It would have been strange enough, a man's enjoying himself in this 

quiet manner, while the prison was burning, and such a tumult was 

cleaving the air, though he had been outside the walls.  But here, 

in the very heart of the building, and moreover with the prayers 

and cries of the four men under sentence sounding in his ears, and 

their hands, stretched our through the gratings in their cell-

doors, clasped in frantic entreaty before his very eyes, it was 

particularly remarkable.  Indeed, Mr Dennis appeared to think it an 

uncommon circumstance, and to banter himself upon it; for he thrust 

his hat on one side as some men do when they are in a waggish 

humour, sucked the head of his stick with a higher relish, and 

smiled as though he would say, 'Dennis, you're a rum dog; you're a 

queer fellow; you're capital company, Dennis, and quite a 

character!'



He sat in this way for some minutes, while the four men in the 

cells, who were certain that somebody had entered the gallery, but 

could not see who, gave vent to such piteous entreaties as wretches 

in their miserable condition may be supposed to have been inspired 

with: urging, whoever it was, to set them at liberty, for the love 

of Heaven; and protesting, with great fervour, and truly enough, 

perhaps, for the time, that if they escaped, they would amend their 

ways, and would never, never, never again do wrong before God or 

man, but would lead penitent and sober lives, and sorrowfully 

repent the crimes they had committed.  The terrible energy with 

which they spoke, would have moved any person, no matter how good 

or just (if any good or just person could have strayed into that 

sad place that night), to have set them at liberty: and, while he 

would have left any other punishment to its free course, to have 

saved them from this last dreadful and repulsive penalty; which 

never turned a man inclined to evil, and has hardened thousands who 

were half inclined to good.



Mr Dennis, who had been bred and nurtured in the good old school, 

and had administered the good old laws on the good old plan, always 

once and sometimes twice every six weeks, for a long time, bore 

these appeals with a deal of philosophy.  Being at last, however, 

rather disturbed in his pleasant reflection by their repetition, he 

rapped at one of the doors with his stick, and cried:



'Hold your noise there, will you?'



At this they all cried together that they were to be hanged on the 

next day but one; and again implored his aid.



'Aid! For what!' said Mr Dennis, playfully rapping the knuckles of 

the hand nearest him.



'To save us!' they cried.



'Oh, certainly,' said Mr Dennis, winking at the wall in the absence 

of any friend with whom he could humour the joke.  'And so you're 

to be worked off, are you, brothers?'



'Unless we are released to-night,' one of them cried, 'we are dead 

men!'



'I tell you what it is,' said the hangman, gravely; 'I'm afraid, my 

friend, that you're not in that 'ere state of mind that's suitable 

to your condition, then; you're not a-going to be released: don't 

think it--Will you leave off that 'ere indecent row?  I wonder you 

an't ashamed of yourselves, I do.'



He followed up this reproof by rapping every set of knuckles one 

after the other, and having done so, resumed his seat again with a 

cheerful countenance.



'You've had law,' he said, crossing his legs and elevating his 

eyebrows: 'laws have been made a' purpose for you; a wery handsome 

prison's been made a' purpose for you; a parson's kept a purpose 

for you; a constitootional officer's appointed a' purpose for you; 

carts is maintained a' purpose for you--and yet you're not 

contented!--WILL you hold that noise, you sir in the furthest?'



A groan was the only answer.



'So well as I can make out,' said Mr Dennis, in a tone of mingled 

badinage and remonstrance, 'there's not a man among you.  I begin 

to think I'm on the opposite side, and among the ladies; though for 

the matter of that, I've seen a many ladies face it out, in a 

manner that did honour to the sex.--You in number two, don't grind 

them teeth of yours.  Worse manners,' said the hangman, rapping at 

the door with his stick, 'I never see in this place afore.  I'm 

ashamed of you.  You're a disgrace to the Bailey.'



After pausing for a moment to hear if anything could be pleaded in 

justification, Mr Dennis resumed in a sort of coaxing tone:



'Now look'ee here, you four.  I'm come here to take care of you, 

and see that you an't burnt, instead of the other thing.  It's no 

use your making any noise, for you won't be found out by them as 

has broken in, and you'll only be hoarse when you come to the 

speeches,--which is a pity.  What I say in respect to the speeches 

always is, "Give it mouth."  That's my maxim.  Give it mouth.  I've 

heerd,' said the hangman, pulling off his hat to take his 

handkerchief from the crown and wipe his face, and then putting it 

on again a little more on one side than before, 'I've heerd a 

eloquence on them boards--you know what boards I mean--and have 

heerd a degree of mouth given to them speeches, that they was as 

clear as a bell, and as good as a play.  There's a pattern!  And 

always, when a thing of this natur's to come off, what I stand up 

for, is, a proper frame of mind.  Let's have a proper frame of 

mind, and we can go through with it, creditable--pleasant--

sociable.  Whatever you do (and I address myself in particular, to 

you in the furthest), never snivel.  I'd sooner by half, though I 

lose by it, see a man tear his clothes a' purpose to spile 'em 

before they come to me, than find him snivelling.  It's ten to one 

a better frame of mind, every way!'



While the hangman addressed them to this effect, in the tone and 

with the air of a pastor in familiar conversation with his flock, 

the noise had been in some degree subdued; for the rioters were 

busy in conveying the prisoners to the Sessions House, which was 

beyond the main walls of the prison, though connected with it, and 

the crowd were busy too, in passing them from thence along the 

street.  But when he had got thus far in his discourse, the sound 

of voices in the yard showed plainly that the mob had returned and 

were coming that way; and directly afterwards a violent crashing at 

the grate below, gave note of their attack upon the cells (as they 

were called) at last.



It was in vain the hangman ran from door to door, and covered the 

grates, one after another, with his hat, in futile efforts to 

stifle the cries of the four men within; it was in vain he dogged 

their outstretched hands, and beat them with his stick, or menaced 

them with new and lingering pains in the execution of his office; 

the place resounded with their cries.  These, together with the 

feeling that they were now the last men in the jail, so worked upon 

and stimulated the besiegers, that in an incredibly short space of 

time they forced the strong grate down below, which was formed of 

iron rods two inches square, drove in the two other doors, as if 

they had been but deal partitions, and stood at the end of the 

gallery with only a bar or two between them and the cells.



'Halloa!' cried Hugh, who was the first to look into the dusky 

passage: 'Dennis before us!  Well done, old boy.  Be quick, and 

open here, for we shall be suffocated in the smoke, going out.'



'Go out at once, then,' said Dennis.  'What do you want here?'



'Want!' echoed Hugh.  'The four men.'



'Four devils!' cried the hangman.  'Don't you know they're left for 

death on Thursday?  Don't you respect the law--the constitootion--

nothing?  Let the four men be.'



'Is this a time for joking?' cried Hugh.  'Do you hear 'em?  Pull 

away these bars that have got fixed between the door and the 

ground; and let us in.'



'Brother,' said the hangman, in a low voice, as he stooped under 

pretence of doing what Hugh desired, but only looked up in his 

face, 'can't you leave these here four men to me, if I've the whim!  

You do what you like, and have what you like of everything for your 

share,--give me my share.  I want these four men left alone, I tell 

you!'



'Pull the bars down, or stand out of the way,' was Hugh's reply.



'You can turn the crowd if you like, you know that well enough, 

brother,' said the hangman, slowly.  'What!  You WILL come in, will 

you?'



'Yes.'



'You won't let these men alone, and leave 'em to me?  You've no 

respect for nothing--haven't you?' said the hangman, retreating to 

the door by which he had entered, and regarding his companion with 

a scowl.  'You WILL come in, will you, brother!'



'I tell you, yes.  What the devil ails you?  Where are you going?'



'No matter where I'm going,' rejoined the hangman, looking in again 

at the iron wicket, which he had nearly shut upon himself, and 

held ajar.  'Remember where you're coming.  That's all!'



With that, he shook his likeness at Hugh, and giving him a grin, 

compared with which his usual smile was amiable, disappeared, and 

shut the door.



Hugh paused no longer, but goaded alike by the cries of the 

convicts, and by the impatience of the crowd, warned the man 

immediately behind him--the way was only wide enough for one 

abreast--to stand back, and wielded a sledge-hammer with such 

strength, that after a few blows the iron bent and broke, and gave 

them free admittance.



It the two sons of one of these men, of whom mention has been made, 

were furious in their zeal before, they had now the wrath and 

vigour of lions.  Calling to the man within each cell, to keep as 

far back as he could, lest the axes crashing through the door 

should wound him, a party went to work upon each one, to beat it in 

by sheer strength, and force the bolts and staples from their hold.  

But although these two lads had the weakest party, and the worst 

armed, and did not begin until after the others, having stopped to 

whisper to him through the grate, that door was the first open, and 

that man was the first out.  As they dragged him into the gallery 

to knock off his irons, he fell down among them, a mere heap of 

chains, and was carried out in that state on men's shoulders, with 

no sign of life.



The release of these four wretched creatures, and conveying them, 

astounded and bewildered, into the streets so full of life--a 

spectacle they had never thought to see again, until they emerged 

from solitude and silence upon that last journey, when the air 

should be heavy with the pent-up breath of thousands, and the 

streets and houses should be built and roofed with human faces, not 

with bricks and tiles and stones--was the crowning horror of the 

scene.  Their pale and haggard looks and hollow eyes; their 

staggering feet, and hands stretched out as if to save themselves 

from falling; their wandering and uncertain air; the way they 

heaved and gasped for breath, as though in water, when they were 

first plunged into the crowd; all marked them for the men.  No need 

to say 'this one was doomed to die;' for there were the words 

broadly stamped and branded on his face.  The crowd fell off, as if 

they had been laid out for burial, and had risen in their shrouds; 

and many were seen to shudder, as though they had been actually 

dead men, when they chanced to touch or brush against their 

garments.



At the bidding of the mob, the houses were all illuminated that 

night--lighted up from top to bottom as at a time of public gaiety 

and joy.  Many years afterwards, old people who lived in their 

youth near this part of the city, remembered being in a great glare 

of light, within doors and without, and as they looked, timid and 

frightened children, from the windows, seeing a FACE go by.  Though 

the whole great crowd and all its other terrors had faded from 

their recollection, this one object remained; alone, distinct, and 

well remembered.  Even in the unpractised minds of infants, one of 

these doomed men darting past, and but an instant seen, was an 

image of force enough to dim the whole concourse; to find itself an 

all-absorbing place, and hold it ever after.



When this last task had been achieved, the shouts and cries grew 

fainter; the clank of fetters, which had resounded on all sides as 

the prisoners escaped, was heard no more; all the noises of the 

crowd subsided into a hoarse and sullen murmur as it passed into 

the distance; and when the human tide had rolled away, a melancholy 

heap of smoking ruins marked the spot where it had lately chafed 

and roared.
