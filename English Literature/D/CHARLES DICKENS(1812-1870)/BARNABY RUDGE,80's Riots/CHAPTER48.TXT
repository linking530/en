Uncertain where to go next, and bewildered by the crowd of people 

who were already astir, they sat down in one of the recesses on the 

bridge, to rest.  They soon became aware that the stream of life 

was all pouring one way, and that a vast throng of persons were 

crossing the river from the Middlesex to the Surrey shore, in 

unusual haste and evident excitement.  They were, for the most 

part, in knots of two or three, or sometimes half-a-dozen; they 

spoke little together--many of them were quite silent; and hurried 

on as if they had one absorbing object in view, which was common to 

them all.



They were surprised to see that nearly every man in this great 

concourse, which still came pouring past, without slackening in the 

least, wore in his hat a blue cockade; and that the chance 

passengers who were not so decorated, appeared timidly anxious to 

escape observation or attack, and gave them the wall as if they 

would conciliate them.  This, however, was natural enough, 

considering their inferiority in point of numbers; for the 

proportion of those who wore blue cockades, to those who were 

dressed as usual, was at least forty or fifty to one.  There was no 

quarrelling, however: the blue cockades went swarming on, passing 

each other when they could, and making all the speed that was 

possible in such a multitude; and exchanged nothing more than 

looks, and very often not even those, with such of the passers-by 

as were not of their number.



At first, the current of people had been confined to the two 

pathways, and but a few more eager stragglers kept the road.  But 

after half an hour or so, the passage was completely blocked up by 

the great press, which, being now closely wedged together, and 

impeded by the carts and coaches it encountered, moved but slowly, 

and was sometimes at a stand for five or ten minutes together.



After the lapse of nearly two hours, the numbers began to diminish 

visibly, and gradually dwindling away, by little and little, left 

the bridge quite clear, save that, now and then, some hot and dusty 

man, with the cockade in his hat, and his coat thrown over his 

shoulder, went panting by, fearful of being too late, or stopped to 

ask which way his friends had taken, and being directed, hastened 

on again like one refreshed.  In this comparative solitude, which 

seemed quite strange and novel after the late crowd, the widow had 

for the first time an opportunity of inquiring of an old man who 

came and sat beside them, what was the meaning of that great 

assemblage.



'Why, where have you come from,' he returned, 'that you haven't 

heard of Lord George Gordon's great association?  This is the day 

that he presents the petition against the Catholics, God bless 

him!'



'What have all these men to do with that?' she said.



'What have they to do with it!' the old man replied.  'Why, how you 

talk!  Don't you know his lordship has declared he won't present it 

to the house at all, unless it is attended to the door by forty 

thousand good and true men at least?  There's a crowd for you!'



'A crowd indeed!' said Barnaby.  'Do you hear that, mother!'



'And they're mustering yonder, as I am told,' resumed the old man, 

'nigh upon a hundred thousand strong.  Ah!  Let Lord George alone.  

He knows his power.  There'll be a good many faces inside them 

three windows over there,' and he pointed to where the House of 

Commons overlooked the river, 'that'll turn pale when good Lord 

George gets up this afternoon, and with reason too!  Ay, ay.  Let 

his lordship alone.  Let him alone.  HE knows!'  And so, with much 

mumbling and chuckling and shaking of his forefinger, he rose, with 

the assistance of his stick, and tottered off.



'Mother!' said Barnaby, 'that's a brave crowd he talks of.  Come!'



'Not to join it!' cried his mother.



'Yes, yes,' he answered, plucking at her sleeve.  'Why not?  Come!'



'You don't know,' she urged, 'what mischief they may do, where they 

may lead you, what their meaning is.  Dear Barnaby, for my sake--'



'For your sake!' he cried, patting her hand.  'Well! It IS for your 

sake, mother.  You remember what the blind man said, about the 

gold.  Here's a brave crowd!  Come!  Or wait till I come back--yes, 

yes, wait here.'



She tried with all the earnestness her fears engendered, to turn 

him from his purpose, but in vain.  He was stooping down to buckle 

on his shoe, when a hackney-coach passed them rather quickly, and a 

voice inside called to the driver to stop.



'Young man,' said a voice within.



'Who's that?' cried Barnaby, looking up.



'Do you wear this ornament?' returned the stranger, holding out a 

blue cockade.



'In Heaven's name, no.  Pray do not give it him!' exclaimed the 

widow.



'Speak for yourself, woman,' said the man within the coach, coldly.  

'Leave the young man to his choice; he's old enough to make it, and 

to snap your apron-strings.  He knows, without your telling, 

whether he wears the sign of a loyal Englishman or not.'



Barnaby, trembling with impatience, cried, 'Yes! yes, yes, I do,' 

as he had cried a dozen times already.  The man threw him a 

cockade, and crying, 'Make haste to St George's Fields,' ordered 

the coachman to drive on fast; and left them.



With hands that trembled with his eagerness to fix the bauble in 

his hat, Barnaby was adjusting it as he best could, and hurriedly 

replying to the tears and entreaties of his mother, when two 

gentlemen passed on the opposite side of the way.  Observing them, 

and seeing how Barnaby was occupied, they stopped, whispered 

together for an instant, turned back, and came over to them.



'Why are you sitting here?' said one of them, who was dressed in a 

plain suit of black, wore long lank hair, and carried a great cane.  

'Why have you not gone with the rest?'



'I am going, sir,' replied Barnaby, finishing his task, and putting 

his hat on with an air of pride.  'I shall be there directly.'



'Say "my lord," young man, when his lordship does you the honour of 

speaking to you,' said the second gentleman mildly.  'If you don't 

know Lord George Gordon when you see him, it's high time you 

should.'



'Nay, Gashford,' said Lord George, as Barnaby pulled off his hat 

again and made him a low bow, 'it's no great matter on a day like 

this, which every Englishman will remember with delight and pride.  

Put on your hat, friend, and follow us, for you lag behind and are 

late.  It's past ten now.  Didn't you know that the hour for 

assembling was ten o'clock?'



Barnaby shook his head and looked vacantly from one to the other.



'You might have known it, friend,' said Gashford, 'it was perfectly 

understood.  How came you to be so ill informed?'



'He cannot tell you, sir,' the widow interposed.  'It's of no use 

to ask him.  We are but this morning come from a long distance in 

the country, and know nothing of these matters.'



'The cause has taken a deep root, and has spread its branches far 

and wide,' said Lord George to his secretary.  'This is a pleasant 

hearing.  I thank Heaven for it!'



'Amen!' cried Gashford with a solemn face.



'You do not understand me, my lord,' said the widow.  'Pardon me, 

but you cruelly mistake my meaning.  We know nothing of these 

matters.  We have no desire or right to join in what you are about 

to do.  This is my son, my poor afflicted son, dearer to me than my 

own life.  In mercy's name, my lord, go your way alone, and do not 

tempt him into danger!'



'My good woman,' said Gashford, 'how can you!--Dear me!--What do 

you mean by tempting, and by danger?  Do you think his lordship is 

a roaring lion, going about and seeking whom he may devour?  God 

bless me!'



'No, no, my lord, forgive me,' implored the widow, laying both her 

hands upon his breast, and scarcely knowing what she did, or said, 

in the earnestness of her supplication, 'but there are reasons why 

you should hear my earnest, mother's prayer, and leave my son with 

me.  Oh do!  He is not in his right senses, he is not, indeed!'



'It is a bad sign of the wickedness of these times,' said Lord 

George, evading her touch, and colouring deeply, 'that those who 

cling to the truth and support the right cause, are set down as 

mad.  Have you the heart to say this of your own son, unnatural 

mother!'



'I am astonished at you!' said Gashford, with a kind of meek 

severity.  'This is a very sad picture of female depravity.'



'He has surely no appearance,' said Lord George, glancing at 

Barnaby, and whispering in his secretary's ear, 'of being deranged?  

And even if he had, we must not construe any trifling peculiarity 

into madness.  Which of us'--and here he turned red again--'would 

be safe, if that were made the law!'



'Not one,' replied the secretary; 'in that case, the greater the 

zeal, the truth, and talent; the more direct the call from above; 

the clearer would be the madness.  With regard to this young man, 

my lord,' he added, with a lip that slightly curled as he looked at 

Barnaby, who stood twirling his hat, and stealthily beckoning them 

to come away, 'he is as sensible and self-possessed as any one I 

ever saw.'



'And you desire to make one of this great body?' said Lord George, 

addressing him; 'and intended to make one, did you?'



'Yes--yes,' said Barnaby, with sparkling eyes.  'To be sure I did!  

I told her so myself.'



'I see,' replied Lord George, with a reproachful glance at the 

unhappy mother.  'I thought so.  Follow me and this gentleman, and 

you shall have your wish.'



Barnaby kissed his mother tenderly on the cheek, and bidding her be 

of good cheer, for their fortunes were both made now, did as he was 

desired.  She, poor woman, followed too--with how much fear and 

grief it would be hard to tell.



They passed quickly through the Bridge Road, where the shops were 

all shut up (for the passage of the great crowd and the expectation 

of their return had alarmed the tradesmen for their goods and 

windows), and where, in the upper stories, all the inhabitants were 

congregated, looking down into the street below, with faces 

variously expressive of alarm, of interest, expectancy, and 

indignation.  Some of these applauded, and some hissed; but 

regardless of these interruptions--for the noise of a vast 

congregation of people at a little distance, sounded in his ears 

like the roaring of the sea--Lord George Gordon quickened his pace, 

and presently arrived before St George's Fields.



They were really fields at that time, and of considerable extent.  

Here an immense multitude was collected, bearing flags of various 

kinds and sizes, but all of the same colour--blue, like the 

cockades--some sections marching to and fro in military array, and 

others drawn up in circles, squares, and lines.  A large portion, 

both of the bodies which paraded the ground, and of those which 

remained stationary, were occupied in singing hymns or psalms.  

With whomsoever this originated, it was well done; for the sound of 

so many thousand voices in the air must have stirred the heart of 

any man within him, and could not fail to have a wonderful effect 

upon enthusiasts, however mistaken.



Scouts had been posted in advance of the great body, to give notice 

of their leader's coming.  These falling back, the word was quickly 

passed through the whole host, and for a short interval there 

ensued a profound and deathlike silence, during which the mass was 

so still and quiet, that the fluttering of a banner caught the eye, 

and became a circumstance of note.  Then they burst into a 

tremendous shout, into another, and another; and the air seemed 

rent and shaken, as if by the discharge of cannon.



'Gashford!' cried Lord George, pressing his secretary's arm tight 

within his own, and speaking with as much emotion in his voice, as 

in his altered face, 'I arn called indeed, now.  I feel and know 

it.  I am the leader of a host.  If they summoned me at this moment 

with one voice to lead them on to death, I'd do it--Yes, and fall 

first myself!'



'It is a proud sight,' said the secretary.  'It is a noble day for 

England, and for the great cause throughout the world.  Such 

homage, my lord, as I, an humble but devoted man, can render--'



'What are you doing?' cried his master, catching him by both hands; 

for he had made a show of kneeling at his feet.  'Do not unfit me, 

dear Gashford, for the solemn duty of this glorious day--' the 

tears stood in the eyes of the poor gentleman as he said the 

words.--'Let us go among them; we have to find a place in some 

division for this new recruit--give me your hand.'



Gashford slid his cold insidious palm into his master's grasp, and 

so, hand in hand, and followed still by Barnaby and by his mother 

too, they mingled with the concourse.



They had by this time taken to their singing again, and as their 

leader passed between their ranks, they raised their voices to 

their utmost.  Many of those who were banded together to support 

the religion of their country, even unto death, had never heard a 

hymn or psalm in all their lives.  But these fellows having for the 

most part strong lungs, and being naturally fond of singing, 

chanted any ribaldry or nonsense that occurred to them, feeling 

pretty certain that it would not be detected in the general chorus, 

and not caring much if it were.  Many of these voluntaries were 

sung under the very nose of Lord George Gordon, who, quite 

unconscious of their burden, passed on with his usual stiff and 

solemn deportment, very much edified and delighted by the pious 

conduct of his followers.



So they went on and on, up this line, down that, round the exterior 

of this circle, and on every side of that hollow square; and still 

there were lines, and squares, and circles out of number to review.  

The day being now intensely hot, and the sun striking down his 

fiercest rays upon the field, those who carried heavy banners began 

to grow faint and weary; most of the number assembled were fain to 

pull off their neckcloths, and throw their coats and waistcoats 

open; and some, towards the centre, quite overpowered by the 

excessive heat, which was of course rendered more unendurable by 

the multitude around them, lay down upon the grass, and offered all 

they had about them for a drink of water.  Still, no man left the 

ground, not even of those who were so distressed; still Lord 

George, streaming from every pore, went on with Gashford; and still 

Barnaby and his mother followed close behind them.



They had arrived at the top of a long line of some eight hundred 

men in single file, and Lord George had turned his head to look 

back, when a loud cry of recognition--in that peculiar and half-

stifled tone which a voice has, when it is raised in the open air 

and in the midst of a great concourse of persons--was heard, and a 

man stepped with a shout of laughter from the rank, and smote 

Barnaby on the shoulders with his heavy hand.



'How now!' he cried.  'Barnaby Rudge!  Why, where have you been 

hiding for these hundred years?'



Barnaby had been thinking within himself that the smell of the 

trodden grass brought back his old days at cricket, when he was a 

young boy and played on Chigwell Green.  Confused by this sudden 

and boisterous address, he stared in a bewildered manner at the 

man, and could scarcely say 'What! Hugh!'



'Hugh!' echoed the other; 'ay, Hugh--Maypole Hugh!  You remember my 

dog?  He's alive now, and will know you, I warrant.  What, you wear 

the colour, do you?  Well done!  Ha ha ha!'



'You know this young man, I see,' said Lord George.



'Know him, my lord! as well as I know my own right hand.  My 

captain knows him.  We all know him.'



'Will you take him into your division?'



'It hasn't in it a better, nor a nimbler, nor a more active man, 

than Barnaby Rudge,' said Hugh.  'Show me the man who says it has!  

Fall in, Barnaby.  He shall march, my lord, between me and Dennis; 

and he shall carry,' he added, taking a flag from the hand of a 

tired man who tendered it, 'the gayest silken streamer in this 

valiant army.'



'In the name of God, no!' shrieked the widow, darting forward.  

'Barnaby--my lord--see--he'll come back--Barnaby--Barnaby!'



'Women in the field!' cried Hugh, stepping between them, and 

holding her off.  'Holloa!  My captain there!'



'What's the matter here?' cried Simon Tappertit, bustling up in a 

great heat.  'Do you call this order?'



'Nothing like it, captain,' answered Hugh, still holding her back 

with his outstretched hand.  'It's against all orders.  Ladies are 

carrying off our gallant soldiers from their duty.  The word of 

command, captain!  They're filing off the ground.  Quick!'



'Close!' cried Simon, with the whole power of his lungs.  'Form!  

March!'



She was thrown to the ground; the whole field was in motion; 

Barnaby was whirled away into the heart of a dense mass of men, and 

she saw him no more.
