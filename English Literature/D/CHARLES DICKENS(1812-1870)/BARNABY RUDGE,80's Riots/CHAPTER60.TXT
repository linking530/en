The three worthies turned their faces towards The Boot, with the 

intention of passing the night in that place of rendezvous, and of 

seeking the repose they so much needed in the shelter of their old 

den; for now that the mischief and destruction they had purposed 

were achieved, and their prisoners were safely bestowed for the 

night, they began to be conscious of exhaustion, and to feel the 

wasting effects of the madness which had led to such deplorable 

results.



Notwithstanding the lassitude and fatigue which oppressed him now, 

in common with his two companions, and indeed with all who had 

taken an active share in that night's work, Hugh's boisterous 

merriment broke out afresh whenever he looked at Simon Tappertit, 

and vented itself--much to that gentleman's indignation--in such 

shouts of laughter as bade fair to bring the watch upon them, and 

involve them in a skirmish, to which in their present worn-out 

condition they might prove by no means equal.  Even Mr Dennis, who 

was not at all particular on the score of gravity or dignity, and 

who had a great relish for his young friend's eccentric humours, 

took occasion to remonstrate with him on this imprudent behaviour, 

which he held to be a species of suicide, tantamount to a man's 

working himself off without being overtaken by the law, than which 

he could imagine nothing more ridiculous or impertinent.



Not abating one jot of his noisy mirth for these remonstrances, 

Hugh reeled along between them, having an arm of each, until they 

hove in sight of The Boot, and were within a field or two of that 

convenient tavern.  He happened by great good luck to have roared 

and shouted himself into silence by this time.  They were 

proceeding onward without noise, when a scout who had been creeping 

about the ditches all night, to warn any stragglers from 

encroaching further on what was now such dangerous ground, peeped 

cautiously from his hiding-place, and called to them to stop.



'Stop! and why?' said Hugh.



Because (the scout replied) the house was filled with constables 

and soldiers; having been surprised that afternoon.  The inmates 

had fled or been taken into custody, he could not say which.  He 

had prevented a great many people from approaching nearer, and he 

believed they had gone to the markets and such places to pass the 

night.  He had seen the distant fires, but they were all out now.  

He had heard the people who passed and repassed, speaking of them 

too, and could report that the prevailing opinion was one of 

apprehension and dismay.  He had not heard a word of Barnaby--

didn't even know his name--but it had been said in his hearing that 

some man had been taken and carried off to Newgate.  Whether this 

was true or false, he could not affirm.



The three took counsel together, on hearing this, and debated what 

it might be best to do.  Hugh, deeming it possible that Barnaby was 

in the hands of the soldiers, and at that moment under detention at 

The Boot, was for advancing stealthily, and firing the house; but 

his companions, who objected to such rash measures unless they had 

a crowd at their backs, represented that if Barnaby were taken he 

had assuredly been removed to a stronger prison; they would never 

have dreamed of keeping him all night in a place so weak and open 

to attack.  Yielding to this reasoning, and to their persuasions, 

Hugh consented to turn back and to repair to Fleet Market; for 

which place, it seemed, a few of their boldest associates had 

shaped their course, on receiving the same intelligence.



Feeling their strength recruited and their spirits roused, now that 

there was a new necessity for action, they hurried away, quite 

forgetful of the fatigue under which they had been sinking but a 

few minutes before; and soon arrived at their new place of 

destination.



Fleet Market, at that time, was a long irregular row of wooden 

sheds and penthouses, occupying the centre of what is now called 

Farringdon Street.  They were jumbled together in a most unsightly 

fashion, in the middle of the road; to the great obstruction of the 

thoroughfare and the annoyance of passengers, who were fain to make 

their way, as they best could, among carts, baskets, barrows, 

trucks, casks, bulks, and benches, and to jostle with porters, 

hucksters, waggoners, and a motley crowd of buyers, sellers, pick-

pockets, vagrants, and idlers.  The air was perfumed with the 

stench of rotten leaves and faded fruit; the refuse of the 

butchers' stalls, and offal and garbage of a hundred kinds.  It was 

indispensable to most public conveniences in those days, that they 

should be public nuisances likewise; and Fleet Market maintained 

the principle to admiration.



To this place, perhaps because its sheds and baskets were a 

tolerable substitute for beds, or perhaps because it afforded the 

means of a hasty barricade in case of need, many of the rioters had 

straggled, not only that night, but for two or three nights before.  

It was now broad day, but the morning being cold, a group of them 

were gathered round a fire in a public-house, drinking hot purl, 

and smoking pipes, and planning new schemes for to-morrow.



Hugh and his two friends being known to most of these men, were 

received with signal marks of approbation, and inducted into the 

most honourable seats.  The room-door was closed and fastened to 

keep intruders at a distance, and then they proceeded to exchange 

news.



'The soldiers have taken possession of The Boot, I hear,' said 

Hugh.  'Who knows anything about it?'



Several cried that they did; but the majority of the company 

having been engaged in the assault upon the Warren, and all 

present having been concerned in one or other of the night's 

expeditions, it proved that they knew no more than Hugh himself; 

having been merely warned by each other, or by the scout, and 

knowing nothing of their own knowledge.



'We left a man on guard there to-day,' said Hugh, looking round 

him, 'who is not here.  You know who it is--Barnaby, who brought 

the soldier down, at Westminster.  Has any man seen or heard of 

him?'



They shook their heads, and murmured an answer in the negative, as 

each man looked round and appealed to his fellow; when a noise was 

heard without, and a man was heard to say that he wanted Hugh--that 

he must see Hugh.



'He is but one man,' cried Hugh to those who kept the door; 'let 

him come in.'



'Ay, ay!' muttered the others.  'Let him come in.  Let him come 

in.'



The door was accordingly unlocked and opened.  A one-armed man, 

with his head and face tied up with a bloody cloth, as though he 

had been severely beaten, his clothes torn, and his remaining hand 

grasping a thick stick, rushed in among them, and panting for 

breath, demanded which was Hugh.



'Here he is,' replied the person he inquired for.  'I am Hugh.  

What do you want with me?'



'I have a message for you,' said the man.  'You know one Barnaby.'



'What of him?  Did he send the message?'



'Yes.  He's taken.  He's in one of the strong cells in Newgate.  He 

defended himself as well as he could, but was overpowered by 

numbers.  That's his message.'



'When did you see him?' asked Hugh, hastily.



'On his way to prison, where he was taken by a party of soldiers.  

They took a by-road, and not the one we expected.  I was one of 

the few who tried to rescue him, and he called to me, and told me 

to tell Hugh where he was.  We made a good struggle, though it 

failed.  Look here!'



He pointed to his dress and to his bandaged head, and still panting 

for breath, glanced round the room; then faced towards Hugh again.



'I know you by sight,' he said, 'for I was in the crowd on Friday, 

and on Saturday, and yesterday, but I didn't know your name.  

You're a bold fellow, I know.  So is he.  He fought like a lion 

tonight, but it was of no use.  I did my best, considering that I 

want this limb.'



Again he glanced inquisitively round the room or seemed to do so, 

for his face was nearly hidden by the bandage--and again facing 

sharply towards Hugh, grasped his stick as if he half expected to 

be set upon, and stood on the defensive.



If he had any such apprehension, however, he was speedily reassured 

by the demeanour of all present.  None thought of the bearer of the 

tidings.  He was lost in the news he brought.  Oaths, threats, and 

execrations, were vented on all sides.  Some cried that if they 

bore this tamely, another day would see them all in jail; some, 

that they should have rescued the other prisoners, and this would 

not have happened.  One man cried in a loud voice, 'Who'll follow 

me to Newgate!' and there was a loud shout and general rush towards 

the door.



But Hugh and Dennis stood with their backs against it, and kept 

them back, until the clamour had so far subsided that their voices 

could be heard, when they called to them together that to go now, 

in broad day, would be madness; and that if they waited until night 

and arranged a plan of attack, they might release, not only their 

own companions, but all the prisoners, and burn down the jail.



'Not that jail alone,' cried Hugh, 'but every jail in London.  They 

shall have no place to put their prisoners in.  We'll burn them all 

down; make bonfires of them every one!  Here!' he cried, catching 

at the hangman's hand.  'Let all who're men here, join with us.  

Shake hands upon it.  Barnaby out of jail, and not a jail left 

standing!  Who joins?'



Every man there.  And they swore a great oath to release their 

friends from Newgate next night; to force the doors and burn the 

jail; or perish in the fire themselves.
