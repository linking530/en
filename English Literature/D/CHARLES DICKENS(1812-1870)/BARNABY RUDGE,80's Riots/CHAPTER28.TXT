Repairing to a noted coffee-house in Covent Garden when he left the 

locksmith's, Mr Chester sat long over a late dinner, entertaining 

himself exceedingly with the whimsical recollection of his recent 

proceedings, and congratulating himself very much on his great 

cleverness.  Influenced by these thoughts, his face wore an 

expression so benign and tranquil, that the waiter in immediate 

attendance upon him felt he could almost have died in his defence, 

and settled in his own mind (until the receipt of the bill, and a 

very small fee for very great trouble disabused it of the idea) 

that such an apostolic customer was worth half-a-dozen of the 

ordinary run of visitors, at least.



A visit to the gaming-table--not as a heated, anxious venturer, but 

one whom it was quite a treat to see staking his two or three 

pieces in deference to the follies of society, and smiling with 

equal benevolence on winners and losers--made it late before he 

reached home.  It was his custom to bid his servant go to bed at 

his own time unless he had orders to the contrary, and to leave a 

candle on the common stair.  There was a lamp on the landing by 

which he could always light it when he came home late, and having a 

key of the door about him he could enter and go to bed at his 

pleasure.



He opened the glass of the dull lamp, whose wick, burnt up and 

swollen like a drunkard's nose, came flying off in little 

carbuncles at the candle's touch, and scattering hot sparks about, 

rendered it matter of some difficulty to kindle the lazy taper; 

when a noise, as of a man snoring deeply some steps higher up, 

caused him to pause and listen.  It was the heavy breathing of a 

sleeper, close at hand.  Some fellow had lain down on the open 

staircase, and was slumbering soundly.  Having lighted the candle 

at length and opened his own door, he softly ascended, holding the 

taper high above his head, and peering cautiously about; curious to 

see what kind of man had chosen so comfortless a shelter for his 

lodging.



With his head upon the landing and his great limbs flung over half-

a-dozen stairs, as carelessly as though he were a dead man whom 

drunken bearers had thrown down by chance, there lay Hugh, face 

uppermost, his long hair drooping like some wild weed upon his 

wooden pillow, and his huge chest heaving with the sounds which so 

unwontedly disturbed the place and hour.



He who came upon him so unexpectedly was about to break his rest by 

thrusting him with his foot, when, glancing at his upturned face, 

he arrested himself in the very action, and stooping down and 

shading the candle with his hand, examined his features closely.  

Close as his first inspection was, it did not suffice, for he 

passed the light, still carefully shaded as before, across and 

across his face, and yet observed him with a searching eye.



While he was thus engaged, the sleeper, without any starting or 

turning round, awoke.  There was a kind of fascination in meeting 

his steady gaze so suddenly, which took from the other the presence 

of mind to withdraw his eyes, and forced him, as it were, to meet 

his look.  So they remained staring at each other, until Mr Chester 

at last broke silence, and asked him in a low voice, why he lay 

sleeping there.



'I thought,' said Hugh, struggling into a sitting posture and 

gazing at him intently, still, 'that you were a part of my dream.  

It was a curious one.  I hope it may never come true, master.'



'What makes you shiver?'



'The--the cold, I suppose,' he growled, as he shook himself and 

rose.  'I hardly know where I am yet.'



'Do you know me?' said Mr Chester.



'Ay, I know you,' he answered.  'I was dreaming of you--we're not 

where I thought we were.  That's a comfort.'



He looked round him as he spoke, and in particular looked above his 

head, as though he half expected to be standing under some object 

which had had existence in his dream.  Then he rubbed his eyes and 

shook himself again, and followed his conductor into his own rooms.



Mr Chester lighted the candles which stood upon his dressing-table, 

and wheeling an easy-chair towards the fire, which was yet 

burning, stirred up a cheerful blaze, sat down before it, and bade 

his uncouth visitor 'Come here,' and draw his boots off.



'You have been drinking again, my fine fellow,' he said, as Hugh 

went down on one knee, and did as he was told.



'As I'm alive, master, I've walked the twelve long miles, and 

waited here I don't know how long, and had no drink between my lips 

since dinner-time at noon.'



'And can you do nothing better, my pleasant friend, than fall 

asleep, and shake the very building with your snores?' said Mr 

Chester.  'Can't you dream in your straw at home, dull dog as you 

are, that you need come here to do it?--Reach me those slippers, 

and tread softly.'



Hugh obeyed in silence.



'And harkee, my dear young gentleman,' said Mr Chester, as he put 

them on, 'the next time you dream, don't let it be of me, but of 

some dog or horse with whom you are better acquainted.  Fill the 

glass once--you'll find it and the bottle in the same place--and 

empty it to keep yourself awake.'



Hugh obeyed again even more zealously--and having done so, 

presented himself before his patron.



'Now,' said Mr Chester, 'what do you want with me?'



'There was news to-day,' returned Hugh.  'Your son was at our 

house--came down on horseback.  He tried to see the young woman, 

but couldn't get sight of her.  He left some letter or some message 

which our Joe had charge of, but he and the old one quarrelled 

about it when your son had gone, and the old one wouldn't let it be 

delivered.  He says (that's the old one does) that none of his 

people shall interfere and get him into trouble.  He's a landlord, 

he says, and lives on everybody's custom.'



'He's a jewel,' smiled Mr Chester, 'and the better for being a dull 

one.--Well?'



'Varden's daughter--that's the girl I kissed--'



'--and stole the bracelet from upon the king's highway,' said Mr 

Chester, composedly.  'Yes; what of her?'



'She wrote a note at our house to the young woman, saying she lost 

the letter I brought to you, and you burnt.  Our Joe was to carry 

it, but the old one kept him at home all next day, on purpose that 

he shouldn't.  Next morning he gave it to me to take; and here it 

is.'



'You didn't deliver it then, my good friend?' said Mr Chester, 

twirling Dolly's note between his finger and thumb, and feigning to 

be surprised.



'I supposed you'd want to have it,' retorted Hugh.  'Burn one, burn 

all, I thought.'



'My devil-may-care acquaintance,' said Mr Chester--'really if you 

do not draw some nicer distinctions, your career will be cut short 

with most surprising suddenness.  Don't you know that the letter 

you brought to me, was directed to my son who resides in this very 

place?  And can you descry no difference between his letters and 

those addressed to other people?'



'If you don't want it,' said Hugh, disconcerted by this reproof, 

for he had expected high praise, 'give it me back, and I'll deliver 

it.  I don't know how to please you, master.'



'I shall deliver it,' returned his patron, putting it away after a 

moment's consideration, 'myself.  Does the young lady walk out, on 

fine mornings?'



'Mostly--about noon is her usual time.'



'Alone?'



'Yes, alone.'



'Where?'



'In the grounds before the house.--Them that the footpath crosses.'



'If the weather should be fine, I may throw myself in her way to-

morrow, perhaps,' said Mr Chester, as coolly as if she were one of 

his ordinary acquaintance.  'Mr Hugh, if I should ride up to the 

Maypole door, you will do me the favour only to have seen me once.  

You must suppress your gratitude, and endeavour to forget my 

forbearance in the matter of the bracelet.  It is natural it should 

break out, and it does you honour; but when other folks are by, you 

must, for your own sake and safety, be as like your usual self as 

though you owed me no obligation whatever, and had never stood 

within these walls.  You comprehend me?'



Hugh understood him perfectly.  After a pause he muttered that he 

hoped his patron would involve him in no trouble about this last 

letter; for he had kept it back solely with the view of pleasing 

him.  He was continuing in this strain, when Mr Chester with a 

most beneficent and patronising air cut him short by saying:



'My good fellow, you have my promise, my word, my sealed bond (for 

a verbal pledge with me is quite as good), that I will always 

protect you so long as you deserve it.  Now, do set your mind at 

rest.  Keep it at ease, I beg of you.  When a man puts himself in 

my power so thoroughly as you have done, I really feel as though he 

had a kind of claim upon me.  I am more disposed to mercy and 

forbearance under such circumstances than I can tell you, Hugh.  Do 

look upon me as your protector, and rest assured, I entreat you, 

that on the subject of that indiscretion, you may preserve, as long 

as you and I are friends, the lightest heart that ever beat within 

a human breast.  Fill that glass once more to cheer you on your 

road homewards--I am really quite ashamed to think how far you have 

to go--and then God bless you for the night.'



'They think,' said Hugh, when he had tossed the liquor down, 'that 

I am sleeping soundly in the stable.  Ha ha ha!  The stable door is 

shut, but the steed's gone, master.'



'You are a most convivial fellow,' returned his friend, 'and I love 

your humour of all things.  Good night!  Take the greatest 

possible care of yourself, for my sake!'



It was remarkable that during the whole interview, each had 

endeavoured to catch stolen glances of the other's face, and had 

never looked full at it.  They interchanged one brief and hasty 

glance as Hugh went out, averted their eyes directly, and so 

separated.  Hugh closed the double doors behind him, carefully and 

without noise; and Mr Chester remained in his easy-chair, with his 

gaze intently fixed upon the fire.



'Well!' he said, after meditating for a long time--and said with a 

deep sigh and an uneasy shifting of his attitude, as though he 

dismissed some other subject from his thoughts, and returned to 

that which had held possession of them all the day--the plot 

thickens; I have thrown the shell; it will explode, I think, in 

eight-and-forty hours, and should scatter these good folks 

amazingly.  We shall see!'



He went to bed and fell asleep, but had not slept long when he 

started up and thought that Hugh was at the outer door, calling in 

a strange voice, very different from his own, to be admitted.  The 

delusion was so strong upon him, and was so full of that vague 

terror of the night in which such visions have their being, that he 

rose, and taking his sheathed sword in his hand, opened the door, 

and looked out upon the staircase, and towards the spot where Hugh 

had lain asleep; and even spoke to him by name.  But all was dark 

and quiet, and creeping back to bed again, he fell, after an hour's 

uneasy watching, into a second sleep, and woke no more till 

morning.
