Although he had had no rest upon the previous night, and had 

watched with little intermission for some weeks past, sleeping only 

in the day by starts and snatches, Mr Haredale, from the dawn of 

morning until sunset, sought his niece in every place where he 

deemed it possible she could have taken refuge.  All day long, 

nothing, save a draught of water, passed his lips; though he 

prosecuted his inquiries far and wide, and never so much as sat 

down, once.



In every quarter he could think of; at Chigwell and in London; at 

the houses of the tradespeople with whom he dealt, and of the 

friends he knew; he pursued his search.  A prey to the most 

harrowing anxieties and apprehensions, he went from magistrate to 

magistrate, and finally to the Secretary of State.  The only 

comfort he received was from this minister, who assured him that 

the Government, being now driven to the exercise of the extreme 

prerogatives of the Crown, were determined to exert them; that a 

proclamation would probably be out upon the morrow, giving to the 

military, discretionary and unlimited power in the suppression of 

the riots; that the sympathies of the King, the Administration, and 

both Houses of Parliament, and indeed of all good men of every 

religious persuasion, were strongly with the injured Catholics; and 

that justice should be done them at any cost or hazard.  He told 

him, moreover, that other persons whose houses had been burnt, had 

for a time lost sight of their children or their relatives, but 

had, in every case, within his knowledge, succeeded in discovering 

them; that his complaint should be remembered, and fully stated in 

the instructions given to the officers in command, and to all the 

inferior myrmidons of justice; and that everything that could be 

done to help him, should be done, with a goodwill and in good 

faith.



Grateful for this consolation, feeble as it was in its reference to 

the past, and little hope as it afforded him in connection with the 

subject of distress which lay nearest to his heart; and really 

thankful for the interest the minister expressed, and seemed to 

feel, in his condition; Mr Haredale withdrew.  He found himself, 

with the night coming on, alone in the streets; and destitute of 

any place in which to lay his head.



He entered an hotel near Charing Cross, and ordered some 

refreshment and a bed.  He saw that his faint and worn appearance 

attracted the attention of the landlord and his waiters; and 

thinking that they might suppose him to be penniless, took out his 

purse, and laid it on the table.  It was not that, the landlord 

said, in a faltering voice.  If he were one of those who had 

suffered by the rioters, he durst not give him entertainment.  He 

had a family of children, and had been twice warned to be careful 

in receiving guests.  He heartily prayed his forgiveness, but what 

could he do?



Nothing.  No man felt that more sincerely than Mr Haredale.  He 

told the man as much, and left the house.



Feeling that he might have anticipated this occurrence, after what 

he had seen at Chigwell in the morning, where no man dared to touch 

a spade, though he offered a large reward to all who would come and 

dig among the ruins of his house, he walked along the Strand; too 

proud to expose himself to another refusal, and of too generous a 

spirit to involve in distress or ruin any honest tradesman who 

might be weak enough to give him shelter.  He wandered into one of 

the streets by the side of the river, and was pacing in a 

thoughtful manner up and down, thinking of things that had happened 

long ago, when he heard a servant-man at an upper window call to 

another on the opposite side of the street, that the mob were 

setting fire to Newgate.



To Newgate! where that man was!  His failing strength returned, 

his energies came back with tenfold vigour, on the instant.  If it 

were possible--if they should set the murderer free--was he, after 

all he had undergone, to die with the suspicion of having slain his 

own brother, dimly gathering about him--



He had no consciousness of going to the jail; but there he stood, 

before it.  There was the crowd wedged and pressed together in a 

dense, dark, moving mass; and there were the flames soaring up into 

the air.  His head turned round and round, lights flashed before 

his eyes, and he struggled hard with two men.



'Nay, nay,' said one.  'Be more yourself, my good sir.  We attract 

attention here.  Come away.  What can you do among so many men?'



'The gentleman's always for doing something,' said the other, 

forcing him along as he spoke.  'I like him for that.  I do like 

him for that.'



They had by this time got him into a court, hard by the prison.  He 

looked from one to the other, and as he tried to release himself, 

felt that he tottered on his feet.  He who had spoken first, was 

the old gentleman whom he had seen at the Lord Mayor's.  The other 

was John Grueby, who had stood by him so manfully at Westminster.



'What does this mean?' he asked them faintly.  'How came we 

together?'



'On the skirts of the crowd,' returned the distiller; 'but come 

with us.  Pray come with us.  You seem to know my friend here?'



'Surely,' said Mr Haredale, looking in a kind of stupor at John.



'He'll tell you then,' returned the old gentleman, 'that I am a man 

to be trusted.  He's my servant.  He was lately (as you know, I 

have no doubt) in Lord George Gordon's service; but he left it, and 

brought, in pure goodwill to me and others, who are marked by the 

rioters, such intelligence as he had picked up, of their designs.'



--'On one condition, please, sir,' said John, touching his hat.  No 

evidence against my lord--a misled man--a kind-hearted man, sir.  

My lord never intended this.'



'The condition will be observed, of course,' rejoined the old 

distiller.  'It's a point of honour.  But come with us, sir; pray 

come with us.'



John Grueby added no entreaties, but he adopted a different kind of 

persuasion, by putting his arm through one of Mr Haredale's, while 

his master took the other, and leading him away with all speed.



Sensible, from a strange lightness in his head, and a difficulty in 

fixing his thoughts on anything, even to the extent of bearing his 

companions in his mind for a minute together without looking at 

them, that his brain was affected by the agitation and suffering 

through which he had passed, and to which he was still a prey, Mr 

Haredale let them lead him where they would.  As they went along, 

he was conscious of having no command over what he said or thought, 

and that he had a fear of going mad.



The distiller lived, as he had told him when they first met, on 

Holborn Hill, where he had great storehouses and drove a large 

trade.  They approached his house by a back entrance, lest they 

should attract the notice of the crowd, and went into an upper 

room which faced towards the street; the windows, however, in 

common with those of every other room in the house, were boarded up 

inside, in order that, out of doors, all might appear quite dark.



They laid him on a sofa in this chamber, perfectly insensible; but 

John immediately fetching a surgeon, who took from him a large 

quantity of blood, he gradually came to himself.  As he was, for 

the time, too weak to walk, they had no difficulty in persuading 

him to remain there all night, and got him to bed without loss of a 

minute.  That done, they gave him cordial and some toast, and 

presently a pretty strong composing-draught, under the influence 

of which he soon fell into a lethargy, and, for a time, forgot his 

troubles.



The vintner, who was a very hearty old fellow and a worthy man, had 

no thoughts of going to bed himself, for he had received several 

threatening warnings from the rioters, and had indeed gone out that 

evening to try and gather from the conversation of the mob whether 

his house was to be the next attacked.  He sat all night in an 

easy-chair in the same room--dozing a little now and then--and 

received from time to time the reports of John Grueby and two or 

three other trustworthy persons in his employ, who went out into 

the streets as scouts; and for whose entertainment an ample 

allowance of good cheer (which the old vintner, despite his 

anxiety, now and then attacked himself) was set forth in an 

adjoining chamber.



These accounts were of a sufficiently alarming nature from the 

first; but as the night wore on, they grew so much worse, and 

involved such a fearful amount of riot and destruction, that in 

comparison with these new tidings all the previous disturbances 

sunk to nothing.



The first intelligence that came, was of the taking of Newgate, and 

the escape of all the prisoners, whose track, as they made up 

Holborn and into the adjacent streets, was proclaimed to those 

citizens who were shut up in their houses, by the rattling of 

their chains, which formed a dismal concert, and was heard in every 

direction, as though so many forges were at work.  The flames too, 

shone so brightly through the vintner's skylights, that the rooms 

and staircases below were nearly as light as in broad day; while 

the distant shouting of the mob seemed to shake the very walls and 

ceilings.



At length they were heard approaching the house, and some minutes 

of terrible anxiety ensued.  They came close up, and stopped before 

it; but after giving three loud yells, went on.  And although they 

returned several times that night, creating new alarms each time, 

they did nothing there; having their hands full.  Shortly after 

they had gone away for the first time, one of the scouts came 

running in with the news that they had stopped before Lord 

Mansfield's house in Bloomsbury Square.



Soon afterwards there came another, and another, and then the first 

returned again, and so, by little and little, their tale was this:--

That the mob gathering round Lord Mansfield's house, had called on 

those within to open the door, and receiving no reply (for Lord and 

Lady Mansfield were at that moment escaping by the backway), forced 

an entrance according to their usual custom.  That they then began 

to demolish the house with great fury, and setting fire to it in 

several parts, involved in a common ruin the whole of the costly 

furniture, the plate and jewels, a beautiful gallery of pictures, 

the rarest collection of manuscripts ever possessed by any one 

private person in the world, and worse than all, because nothing 

could replace this loss, the great Law Library, on almost every 

page of which were notes in the Judge's own hand, of inestimable 

value,--being the results of the study and experience of his whole 

life.  That while they were howling and exulting round the fire, a 

troop of soldiers, with a magistrate among them, came up, and being 

too late (for the mischief was by that time done), began to 

disperse the crowd.  That the Riot Act being read, and the crowd 

still resisting, the soldiers received orders to fire, and 

levelling their muskets shot dead at the first discharge six men 

and a woman, and wounded many persons; and loading again directly, 

fired another volley, but over the people's heads it was supposed, 

as none were seen to fall.  That thereupon, and daunted by the 

shrieks and tumult, the crowd began to disperse, and the soldiers 

went away, leaving the killed and wounded on the ground: which they 

had no sooner done than the rioters came back again, and taking up 

the dead bodies, and the wounded people, formed into a rude 

procession, having the bodies in the front.  That in this order 

they paraded off with a horrible merriment; fixing weapons in the 

dead men's hands to make them look as if alive; and preceded by a 

fellow ringing Lord Mansfield's dinner-bell with all his might.



The scouts reported further, that this party meeting with some 

others who had been at similar work elsewhere, they all united into 

one, and drafting off a few men with the killed and wounded, 

marched away to Lord Mansfield's country seat at Caen Wood, between 

Hampstead and Highgate; bent upon destroying that house likewise, 

and lighting up a great fire there, which from that height should 

be seen all over London.  But in this, they were disappointed, for 

a party of horse having arrived before them, they retreated faster 

than they went, and came straight back to town.



There being now a great many parties in the streets, each went to 

work according to its humour, and a dozen houses were quickly 

blazing, including those of Sir John Fielding and two other 

justices, and four in Holborn--one of the greatest thoroughfares in 

London--which were all burning at the same time, and burned until 

they went out of themselves, for the people cut the engine hose, 

and would not suffer the firemen to play upon the flames.  At one 

house near Moorfields, they found in one of the rooms some canary 

birds in cages, and these they cast into the fire alive.  The poor 

little creatures screamed, it was said, like infants, when they 

were flung upon the blaze; and one man was so touched that he tried 

in vain to save them, which roused the indignation of the crowd, 

and nearly cost him his life.



At this same house, one of the fellows who went through the rooms, 

breaking the furniture and helping to destroy the building, found a 

child's doll--a poor toy--which he exhibited at the window to the 

mob below, as the image of some unholy saint which the late 

occupants had worshipped.  While he was doing this, another man 

with an equally tender conscience (they had both been foremost in 

throwing down the canary birds for roasting alive), took his seat 

on the parapet of the house, and harangued the crowd from a 

pamphlet circulated by the Association, relative to the true 

principles of Christianity!  Meanwhile the Lord Mayor, with his 

hands in his pockets, looked on as an idle man might look at any 

other show, and seemed mightily satisfied to have got a good place.



Such were the accounts brought to the old vintner by his servants 

as he sat at the side of Mr Haredale's bed, having been unable even 

to doze, after the first part of the night; too much disturbed by 

his own fears; by the cries of the mob, the light of the fires, and 

the firing of the soldiers.  Such, with the addition of the release 

of all the prisoners in the New Jail at Clerkenwell, and as many 

robberies of passengers in the streets, as the crowd had leisure to 

indulge in, were the scenes of which Mr Haredale was happily 

unconscious, and which were all enacted before midnight.
