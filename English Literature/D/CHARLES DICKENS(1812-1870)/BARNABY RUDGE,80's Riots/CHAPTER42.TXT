The Royal East London Volunteers made a brilliant sight that day: 

formed into lines, squares, circles, triangles, and what not, to 

the beating of drums, and the streaming of flags; and performed a 

vast number of complex evolutions, in all of which Serjeant Varden 

bore a conspicuous share.  Having displayed their military prowess 

to the utmost in these warlike shows, they marched in glittering 

order to the Chelsea Bun House, and regaled in the adjacent taverns 

until dark.  Then at sound of drum they fell in again, and 

returned amidst the shouting of His Majesty's lieges to the place 

from whence they came.



The homeward march being somewhat tardy,--owing to the un-

soldierlike behaviour of certain corporals, who, being gentlemen of 

sedentary pursuits in private life and excitable out of doors, 

broke several windows with their bayonets, and rendered it 

imperative on the commanding officer to deliver them over to a 

strong guard, with whom they fought at intervals as they came 

along,--it was nine o'clock when the locksmith reached home.  A 

hackney-coach was waiting near his door; and as he passed it, Mr 

Haredale looked from the window and called him by his name.



'The sight of you is good for sore eyes, sir,' said the locksmith, 

stepping up to him.  'I wish you had walked in though, rather than 

waited here.'



'There is nobody at home, I find,' Mr Haredale answered; 'besides, 

I desired to be as private as I could.'



'Humph!' muttered the locksmith, looking round at his house.  

'Gone with Simon Tappertit to that precious Branch, no doubt.'



Mr Haredale invited him to come into the coach, and, if he were not 

tired or anxious to go home, to ride with him a little way that 

they might have some talk together.  Gabriel cheerfully complied, 

and the coachman mounting his box drove off.



'Varden,' said Mr Haredale, after a minute's pause, 'you will be 

amazed to hear what errand I am on; it will seem a very strange 

one.'



'I have no doubt it's a reasonable one, sir, and has a meaning in 

it,' replied the locksmith; 'or it would not be yours at all.  Have 

you just come back to town, sir?'



'But half an hour ago.'



'Bringing no news of Barnaby, or his mother?' said the locksmith 

dubiously.  'Ah! you needn't shake your head, sir.  It was a wild-

goose chase.  I feared that, from the first.  You exhausted all 

reasonable means of discovery when they went away.  To begin again 

after so long a time has passed is hopeless, sir--quite hopeless.'



'Why, where are they?' he returned impatiently.  'Where can they 

be?  Above ground?'



'God knows,' rejoined the locksmith, 'many that I knew above it 

five years ago, have their beds under the grass now.  And the world 

is a wide place.  It's a hopeless attempt, sir, believe me.  We 

must leave the discovery of this mystery, like all others, to time, 

and accident, and Heaven's pleasure.'



'Varden, my good fellow,' said Mr Haredale, 'I have a deeper 

meaning in my present anxiety to find them out, than you can 

fathom.  It is not a mere whim; it is not the casual revival of my 

old wishes and desires; but an earnest, solemn purpose.  My 

thoughts and dreams all tend to it, and fix it in my mind.  I have 

no rest by day or night; I have no peace or quiet; I am haunted.'



His voice was so altered from its usual tones, and his manner 

bespoke so much emotion, that Gabriel, in his wonder, could only 

sit and look towards him in the darkness, and fancy the expression 

of his face.



'Do not ask me,' continued Mr Haredale, 'to explain myself.  If I 

were to do so, you would think me the victim of some hideous fancy.  

It is enough that this is so, and that I cannot--no, I can not--lie 

quietly in my bed, without doing what will seem to you 

incomprehensible.'



'Since when, sir,' said the locksmith after a pause, 'has this 

uneasy feeling been upon you?'



Mr Haredale hesitated for some moments, and then replied: 'Since 

the night of the storm.  In short, since the last nineteenth of 

March.'



As though he feared that Varden might express surprise, or reason 

with him, he hastily went on:



'You will think, I know, I labour under some delusion.  Perhaps I 

do.  But it is not a morbid one; it is a wholesome action of the 

mind, reasoning on actual occurrences.  You know the furniture 

remains in Mrs Rudge's house, and that it has been shut up, by my 

orders, since she went away, save once a-week or so, when an old 

neighbour visits it to scare away the rats.  I am on my way there 

now.'



'For what purpose?' asked the locksmith.



'To pass the night there,' he replied; 'and not to-night alone, but 

many nights.  This is a secret which I trust to you in case of any 

unexpected emergency.  You will not come, unless in case of strong 

necessity, to me; from dusk to broad day I shall be there.  Emma, 

your daughter, and the rest, suppose me out of London, as I have 

been until within this hour.  Do not undeceive them.  This is the 

errand I am bound upon.  I know I may confide it to you, and I rely 

upon your questioning me no more at this time.'



With that, as if to change the theme, he led the astounded 

locksmith back to the night of the Maypole highwayman, to the 

robbery of Edward Chester, to the reappearance of the man at Mrs 

Rudge's house, and to all the strange circumstances which 

afterwards occurred.  He even asked him carelessly about the man's 

height, his face, his figure, whether he was like any one he had 

ever seen--like Hugh, for instance, or any man he had known at any 

time--and put many questions of that sort, which the locksmith, 

considering them as mere devices to engage his attention and 

prevent his expressing the astonishment he felt, answered pretty 

much at random.



At length, they arrived at the corner of the street in which the 

house stood, where Mr Haredale, alighting, dismissed the coach.  

'If you desire to see me safely lodged,' he said, turning to the 

locksmith with a gloomy smile, 'you can.'



Gabriel, to whom all former marvels had been nothing in comparison 

with this, followed him along the narrow pavement in silence.  When 

they reached the door, Mr Haredale softly opened it with a key he 

had about him, and closing it when Varden entered, they were left 

in thorough darkness.



They groped their way into the ground-floor room.  Here Mr 

Haredale struck a light, and kindled a pocket taper he had brought 

with him for the purpose.  It was then, when the flame was full 

upon him, that the locksmith saw for the first time how haggard, 

pale, and changed he looked; how worn and thin he was; how 

perfectly his whole appearance coincided with all that he had said 

so strangely as they rode along.  It was not an unnatural impulse 

in Gabriel, after what he had heard, to note curiously the 

expression of his eyes.  It was perfectly collected and rational;--

so much so, indeed, that he felt ashamed of his momentary 

suspicion, and drooped his own when Mr Haredale looked towards him, 

as if he feared they would betray his thoughts.



'Will you walk through the house?' said Mr Haredale, with a glance 

towards the window, the crazy shutters of which were closed and 

fastened.  'Speak low.'



There was a kind of awe about the place, which would have rendered 

it difficult to speak in any other manner.  Gabriel whispered 

'Yes,' and followed him upstairs.



Everything was just as they had seen it last.  There was a sense of 

closeness from the exclusion of fresh air, and a gloom and 

heaviness around, as though long imprisonment had made the very 

silence sad.  The homely hangings of the beds and windows had begun 

to droop; the dust lay thick upon their dwindling folds; and damps 

had made their way through ceiling, wall, and floor.  The boards 

creaked beneath their tread, as if resenting the unaccustomed 

intrusion; nimble spiders, paralysed by the taper's glare, checked 

the motion of their hundred legs upon the wall, or dropped like 

lifeless things upon the ground; the death-watch ticked; and the 

scampering feet of rats and mice rattled behind the wainscot.



As they looked about them on the decaying furniture, it was strange 

to find how vividly it presented those to whom it had belonged, and 

with whom it was once familiar.  Grip seemed to perch again upon 

his high-backed chair; Barnaby to crouch in his old favourite 

corner by the fire; the mother to resume her usual seat, and watch 

him as of old.  Even when they could separate these objects from 

the phantoms of the mind which they invoked, the latter only glided 

out of sight, but lingered near them still; for then they seemed to 

lurk in closets and behind the doors, ready to start out and 

suddenly accost them in well-remembered tones.



They went downstairs, and again into the room they had just now 

left.  Mr Haredale unbuckled his sword and laid it on the table, 

with a pair of pocket pistols; then told the locksmith he would 

light him to the door.



'But this is a dull place, sir,' said Gabriel lingering; 'may no 

one share your watch?'



He shook his head, and so plainly evinced his wish to be alone, 

that Gabriel could say no more.  In another moment the locksmith 

was standing in the street, whence he could see that the light once 

more travelled upstairs, and soon returning to the room below, 

shone brightly through the chinks of the shutters.



If ever man were sorely puzzled and perplexed, the locksmith was, 

that night.  Even when snugly seated by his own fireside, with Mrs 

Varden opposite in a nightcap and night-jacket, and Dolly beside 

him (in a most distracting dishabille) curling her hair, and 

smiling as if she had never cried in all her life and never could--

even then, with Toby at his elbow and his pipe in his mouth, and 

Miggs (but that perhaps was not much) falling asleep in the 

background, he could not quite discard his wonder and uneasiness.  

So in his dreams--still there was Mr Haredale, haggard and 

careworn, listening in the solitary house to every sound that 

stirred, with the taper shining through the chinks until the day 

should turn it pale and end his lonely watching.
