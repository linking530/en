The mob had been divided from its first assemblage into four 

divisions; the London, the Westminster, the Southwark, and the 

Scotch.  Each of these divisions being subdivided into various 

bodies, and these bodies being drawn up in various forms and 

figures, the general arrangement was, except to the few chiefs and 

leaders, as unintelligible as the plan of a great battle to the 

meanest soldier in the field.  It was not without its method, 

however; for, in a very short space of time after being put in 

motion, the crowd had resolved itself into three great parties, and 

were prepared, as had been arranged, to cross the river by 

different bridges, and make for the House of Commons in separate 

detachments.



At the head of that division which had Westminster Bridge for its 

approach to the scene of action, Lord George Gordon took his post; 

with Gashford at his right hand, and sundry ruffians, of most 

unpromising appearance, forming a kind of staff about him.  The 

conduct of a second party, whose route lay by Blackfriars, was 

entrusted to a committee of management, including perhaps a dozen 

men: while the third, which was to go by London Bridge, and through 

the main streets, in order that their numbers and their serious 

intentions might be the better known and appreciated by the 

citizens, were led by Simon Tappertit (assisted by a few 

subalterns, selected from the Brotherhood of United Bulldogs), 

Dennis the hangman, Hugh, and some others.



The word of command being given, each of these great bodies took 

the road assigned to it, and departed on its way, in perfect order 

and profound silence.  That which went through the City greatly 

exceeded the others in number, and was of such prodigious extent 

that when the rear began to move, the front was nearly four miles 

in advance, notwithstanding that the men marched three abreast and 

followed very close upon each other.



At the head of this party, in the place where Hugh, in the madness 

of his humour, had stationed him, and walking between that 

dangerous companion and the hangman, went Barnaby; as many a man 

among the thousands who looked on that day afterwards remembered 

well.  Forgetful of all other things in the ecstasy of the moment, 

his face flushed and his eyes sparkling with delight, heedless of 

the weight of the great banner he carried, and mindful only of its 

flashing in the sun and rustling in the summer breeze, on he went, 

proud, happy, elated past all telling:--the only light-hearted, 

undesigning creature, in the whole assembly.



'What do you think of this?' asked Hugh, as they passed through the 

crowded streets, and looked up at the windows which were thronged 

with spectators.  'They have all turned out to see our flags and 

streamers?  Eh, Barnaby?  Why, Barnaby's the greatest man of all 

the pack!  His flag's the largest of the lot, the brightest too.  

There's nothing in the show, like Barnaby.  All eyes are turned on 

him.  Ha ha ha!'



'Don't make that din, brother,' growled the hangman, glancing with 

no very approving eyes at Barnaby as he spoke: 'I hope he don't 

think there's nothing to be done, but carrying that there piece of 

blue rag, like a boy at a breaking up.  You're ready for action I 

hope, eh?  You, I mean,' he added, nudging Barnaby roughly with 

his elbow.  'What are you staring at?  Why don't you speak?'



Barnaby had been gazing at his flag, and looked vacantly from his 

questioner to Hugh.



'He don't understand your way,' said the latter.  'Here, I'll 

explain it to him.  Barnaby old boy, attend to me.'



'I'll attend,' said Barnaby, looking anxiously round; 'but I wish 

I could see her somewhere.'



'See who?' demanded Dennis in a gruff tone.  'You an't in love I 

hope, brother?  That an't the sort of thing for us, you know.  We 

mustn't have no love here.'



'She would be proud indeed to see me now, eh Hugh?' said Barnaby.  

'Wouldn't it make her glad to see me at the head of this large 

show?  She'd cry for joy, I know she would.  Where CAN she be?  She 

never sees me at my best, and what do I care to be gay and fine if 

SHE'S not by?'



'Why, what palaver's this?' asked Mr Dennis with supreme disdain.  

'We an't got no sentimental members among us, I hope.'



'Don't be uneasy, brother,' cried Hugh, 'he's only talking of his 

mother.'



'Of his what?' said Mr Dennis with a strong oath.



'His mother.'



'And have I combined myself with this here section, and turned out 

on this here memorable day, to hear men talk about their mothers!' 

growled Mr Dennis with extreme disgust.  'The notion of a man's 

sweetheart's bad enough, but a man's mother!'--and here his disgust 

was so extreme that he spat upon the ground, and could say no more.



'Barnaby's right,' cried Hugh with a grin, 'and I say it.  Lookee, 

bold lad.  If she's not here to see, it's because I've provided for 

her, and sent half-a-dozen gentlemen, every one of 'em with a 

blue flag (but not half as fine as yours), to take her, in state, 

to a grand house all hung round with gold and silver banners, and 

everything else you please, where she'll wait till you come, and 

want for nothing.'



'Ay!' said Barnaby, his face beaming with delight: 'have you 

indeed?  That's a good hearing.  That's fine!  Kind Hugh!'



'But nothing to what will come, bless you,' retorted Hugh, with a 

wink at Dennis, who regarded his new companion in arms with great 

astonishment.



'No, indeed?' cried Barnaby.



'Nothing at all,' said Hugh.  'Money, cocked hats and feathers, red 

coats and gold lace; all the fine things there are, ever were, or 

will be; will belong to us if we are true to that noble gentleman--

the best man in the world--carry our flags for a few days, and keep 

'em safe.  That's all we've got to do.'



'Is that all?' cried Barnaby with glistening eyes, as he clutched 

his pole the tighter; 'I warrant you I keep this one safe, then.  

You have put it in good hands.  You know me, Hugh.  Nobody shall 

wrest this flag away.'



'Well said!' cried Hugh.  'Ha ha!  Nobly said!  That's the old 

stout Barnaby, that I have climbed and leaped with, many and many a 

day--I knew I was not mistaken in Barnaby.--Don't you see, man,' he 

added in a whisper, as he slipped to the other side of Dennis, 

'that the lad's a natural, and can be got to do anything, if you 

take him the right way?  Letting alone the fun he is, he's worth a 

dozen men, in earnest, as you'd find if you tried a fall with him.  

Leave him to me.  You shall soon see whether he's of use or not.'



Mr Dennis received these explanatory remarks with many nods and 

winks, and softened his behaviour towards Barnaby from that moment.  

Hugh, laying his finger on his nose, stepped back into his former 

place, and they proceeded in silence.



It was between two and three o'clock in the afternoon when the 

three great parties met at Westminster, and, uniting into one huge 

mass, raised a tremendous shout.  This was not only done in token 

of their presence, but as a signal to those on whom the task 

devolved, that it was time to take possession of the lobbies of 

both Houses, and of the various avenues of approach, and of the 

gallery stairs.  To the last-named place, Hugh and Dennis, still 

with their pupil between them, rushed straightway; Barnaby having 

given his flag into the hands of one of their own party, who kept 

them at the outer door.  Their followers pressing on behind, they 

were borne as on a great wave to the very doors of the gallery, 

whence it was impossible to retreat, even if they had been so 

inclined, by reason of the throng which choked up the passages.  It 

is a familiar expression in describing a great crowd, that a person 

might have walked upon the people's heads.  In this case it was 

actually done; for a boy who had by some means got among the 

concourse, and was in imminent danger of suffocation, climbed to 

the shoulders of a man beside him and walked upon the people's hats 

and heads into the open street; traversing in his passage the whole 

length of two staircases and a long gallery.  Nor was the swarm 

without less dense; for a basket which had been tossed into the 

crowd, was jerked from head to head, and shoulder to shoulder, and 

went spinning and whirling on above them, until it was lost to 

view, without ever once falling in among them or coming near the 

ground.



Through this vast throng, sprinkled doubtless here and there with 

honest zealots, but composed for the most part of the very scum and 

refuse of London, whose growth was fostered by bad criminal laws, 

bad prison regulations, and the worst conceivable police, such of 

the members of both Houses of Parliament as had not taken the 

precaution to be already at their posts, were compelled to fight 

and force their way.  Their carriages were stopped and broken; the 

wheels wrenched off; the glasses shivered to atoms; the panels 

beaten in; drivers, footmen, and masters, pulled from their seats 

and rolled in the mud.  Lords, commoners, and reverend bishops, 

with little distinction of person or party, were kicked and pinched 

and hustled; passed from hand to hand through various stages of 

ill-usage; and sent to their fellow-senators at last with their 

clothes hanging in ribands about them, their bagwigs torn off, 

themselves speechless and breathless, and their persons covered 

with the powder which had been cuffed and beaten out of their hair.  

One lord was so long in the hands of the populace, that the Peers 

as a body resolved to sally forth and rescue him, and were in the 

act of doing so, when he happily appeared among them covered with 

dirt and bruises, and hardly to be recognised by those who knew him 

best.  The noise and uproar were on the increase every moment.  The 

air was filled with execrations, hoots, and howlings.  The mob 

raged and roared, like a mad monster as it was, unceasingly, and 

each new outrage served to swell its fury.



Within doors, matters were even yet more threatening.  Lord George--

preceded by a man who carried the immense petition on a porter's 

knot through the lobby to the door of the House of Commons, where 

it was received by two officers of the house who rolled it up to 

the table ready for presentation--had taken his seat at an early 

hour, before the Speaker went to prayers.  His followers pouring in 

at the same time, the lobby and all the avenues were immediately 

filled, as we have seen.  Thus the members were not only attacked 

in their passage through the streets, but were set upon within the 

very walls of Parliament; while the tumult, both within and 

without, was so great, that those who attempted to speak could 

scarcely hear their own voices: far less, consult upon the course 

it would be wise to take in such extremity, or animate each other 

to dignified and firm resistance.  So sure as any member, just 

arrived, with dress disordered and dishevelled hair, came 

struggling through the crowd in the lobby, it yelled and screamed 

in triumph; and when the door of the House, partially and 

cautiously opened by those within for his admission, gave them a 

momentary glimpse of the interior, they grew more wild and savage, 

like beasts at the sight of prey, and made a rush against the 

portal which strained its locks and bolts in their staples, and 

shook the very beams.



The strangers' gallery, which was immediately above the door of the 

House, had been ordered to be closed on the first rumour of 

disturbance, and was empty; save that now and then Lord George took 

his seat there, for the convenience of coming to the head of the 

stairs which led to it, and repeating to the people what had passed 

within.  It was on these stairs that Barnaby, Hugh, and Dennis were 

posted.  There were two flights, short, steep, and narrow, running 

parallel to each other, and leading to two little doors 

communicating with a low passage which opened on the gallery.  

Between them was a kind of well, or unglazed skylight, for the 

admission of light and air into the lobby, which might be some 

eighteen or twenty feet below.



Upon one of these little staircases--not that at the head of which 

Lord George appeared from time to time, but the other--Gashford 

stood with his elbow on the bannister, and his cheek resting on his 

hand, with his usual crafty aspect.  Whenever he varied this 

attitude in the slightest degree--so much as by the gentlest motion 

of his arm--the uproar was certain to increase, not merely there, 

but in the lobby below; from which place no doubt, some man who 

acted as fugleman to the rest, was constantly looking up and 

watching him.



'Order!' cried Hugh, in a voice which made itself heard even above 

the roar and tumult, as Lord George appeared at the top of the 

staircase.  'News!  News from my lord!'



The noise continued, notwithstanding his appearance, until Gashford 

looked round.  There was silence immediately--even among the people 

in the passages without, and on the other staircases, who could 

neither see nor hear, but to whom, notwithstanding, the signal was 

conveyed with marvellous rapidity.



'Gentlemen,' said Lord George, who was very pale and agitated, we 

must be firm.  They talk of delays, but we must have no delays.  

They talk of taking your petition into consideration next Tuesday, 

but we must have it considered now.  Present appearances look bad 

for our success, but we must succeed and will!'



'We must succeed and will!' echoed the crowd.  And so among their 

shouts and cheers and other cries, he bowed to them and retired, 

and presently came back again.  There was another gesture from 

Gashford, and a dead silence directly.



'I am afraid,' he said, this time, 'that we have little reason, 

gentlemen, to hope for any redress from the proceedings of 

Parliament.  But we must redress our own grievances, we must meet 

again, we must put our trust in Providence, and it will bless our 

endeavours.'



This speech being a little more temperate than the last, was not so 

favourably received.  When the noise and exasperation were at their 

height, he came back once more, and told them that the alarm had 

gone forth for many miles round; that when the King heard of their 

assembling together in that great body, he had no doubt, His 

Majesty would send down private orders to have their wishes 

complied with; and--with the manner of his speech as childish, 

irresolute, and uncertain as his matter--was proceeding in this 

strain, when two gentlemen suddenly appeared at the door where he 

stood, and pressing past him and coming a step or two lower down 

upon the stairs, confronted the people.



The boldness of this action quite took them by surprise.  They were 

not the less disconcerted, when one of the gentlemen, turning to 

Lord George, spoke thus--in a loud voice that they might hear him 

well, but quite coolly and collectedly:



'You may tell these people, if you please, my lord, that I am 

General Conway of whom they have heard; and that I oppose this 

petition, and all their proceedings, and yours.  I am a soldier, 

you may tell them, and I will protect the freedom of this place 

with my sword.  You see, my lord, that the members of this House 

are all in arms to-day; you know that the entrance to it is a 

narrow one; you cannot be ignorant that there are men within these 

walls who are determined to defend that pass to the last, and 

before whom many lives must fall if your adherents persevere.  Have 

a care what you do.'



'And my Lord George,' said the other gentleman, addressing him in 

like manner, 'I desire them to hear this, from me--Colonel Gordon--

your near relation.  If a man among this crowd, whose uproar 

strikes us deaf, crosses the threshold of the House of Commons, I 

swear to run my sword that moment--not into his, but into your 

body!'



With that, they stepped back again, keeping their faces towards the 

crowd; took each an arm of the misguided nobleman; drew him into 

the passage, and shut the door; which they directly locked and 

fastened on the inside.



This was so quickly done, and the demeanour of both gentlemen--who 

were not young men either--was so gallant and resolute, that the 

crowd faltered and stared at each other with irresolute and timid 

looks.  Many tried to turn towards the door; some of the faintest-

hearted cried they had best go back, and called to those behind to 

give way; and the panic and confusion were increasing rapidly, when 

Gashford whispered Hugh.



'What now!' Hugh roared aloud, turning towards them.  'Why go back?  

Where can you do better than here, boys!  One good rush against 

these doors and one below at the same time, will do the business.  

Rush on, then!  As to the door below, let those stand back who are 

afraid.  Let those who are not afraid, try who shall be the first 

to pass it.  Here goes!  Look out down there!'



Without the delay of an instant, he threw himself headlong over the 

bannisters into the lobby below.  He had hardly touched the ground 

when Barnaby was at his side.  The chaplain's assistant, and some 

members who were imploring the people to retire, immediately 

withdrew; and then, with a great shout, both crowds threw 

themselves against the doors pell-mell, and besieged the House in 

earnest.



At that moment, when a second onset must have brought them into 

collision with those who stood on the defensive within, in which 

case great loss of life and bloodshed would inevitably have 

ensued,--the hindmost portion of the crowd gave way, and the rumour 

spread from mouth to mouth that a messenger had been despatched by 

water for the military, who were forming in the street.  Fearful of 

sustaining a charge in the narrow passages in which they were so 

closely wedged together, the throng poured out as impetuously as 

they had flocked in.  As the whole stream turned at once, Barnaby 

and Hugh went with it: and so, fighting and struggling and 

trampling on fallen men and being trampled on in turn themselves, 

they and the whole mass floated by degrees into the open street, 

where a large detachment of the Guards, both horse and foot, came 

hurrying up; clearing the ground before them so rapidly that the 

people seemed to melt away as they advanced.



The word of command to halt being given, the soldiers formed across 

the street; the rioters, breathless and exhausted with their late 

exertions, formed likewise, though in a very irregular and 

disorderly manner.  The commanding officer rode hastily into the 

open space between the two bodies, accompanied by a magistrate and 

an officer of the House of Commons, for whose accommodation a 

couple of troopers had hastily dismounted.  The Riot Act was read, 

but not a man stirred.



In the first rank of the insurgents, Barnaby and Hugh stood side by 

side.  Somebody had thrust into Barnaby's hands when he came out 

into the street, his precious flag; which, being now rolled up and 

tied round the pole, looked like a giant quarter-staff as he 

grasped it firmly and stood upon his guard.  If ever man believed 

with his whole heart and soul that he was engaged in a just cause, 

and that he was bound to stand by his leader to the last, poor 

Barnaby believed it of himself and Lord George Gordon.



After an ineffectual attempt to make himself heard, the magistrate 

gave the word and the Horse Guards came riding in among the crowd.  

But, even then, he galloped here and there, exhorting the people to 

disperse; and, although heavy stones were thrown at the men, and 

some were desperately cut and bruised, they had no orders but to 

make prisoners of such of the rioters as were the most active, and 

to drive the people back with the flat of their sabres.  As the 

horses came in among them, the throng gave way at many points, and 

the Guards, following up their advantage, were rapidly clearing the 

ground, when two or three of the foremost, who were in a manner cut 

off from the rest by the people closing round them, made straight 

towards Barnaby and Hugh, who had no doubt been pointed out as the 

two men who dropped into the lobby: laying about them now with some 

effect, and inflicting on the more turbulent of their opponents, a 

few slight flesh wounds, under the influence of which a man 

dropped, here and there, into the arms of his fellows, amid much 

groaning and confusion.



At the sight of gashed and bloody faces, seen for a moment in the 

crowd, then hidden by the press around them, Barnaby turned pale 

and sick.  But he stood his ground, and grasping his pole more 

firmly yet, kept his eye fixed upon the nearest soldier--nodding 

his head meanwhile, as Hugh, with a scowling visage, whispered in 

his ear.



The soldier came spurring on, making his horse rear as the people 

pressed about him, cutting at the hands of those who would have 

grasped his rein and forced his charger back, and waving to his 

comrades to follow--and still Barnaby, without retreating an inch, 

waited for his coming.  Some called to him to fly, and some were in 

the very act of closing round him, to prevent his being taken, when 

the pole swept into the air above the people's heads, and the man's 

saddle was empty in an instant.



Then, he and Hugh turned and fled, the crowd opening to let them 

pass, and closing up again so quickly that there was no clue to the 

course they had taken.  Panting for breath, hot, dusty, and 

exhausted with fatigue, they reached the riverside in safety, and 

getting into a boat with all despatch were soon out of any 

immediate danger.



As they glided down the river, they plainly heard the people 

cheering; and supposing they might have forced the soldiers to 

retreat, lay upon their oars for a few minutes, uncertain whether 

to return or not.  But the crowd passing along Westminster Bridge, 

soon assured them that the populace were dispersing; and Hugh 

rightly guessed from this, that they had cheered the magistrate for 

offering to dismiss the military on condition of their immediate 

departure to their several homes, and that he and Barnaby were 

better where they were.  He advised, therefore, that they should 

proceed to Blackfriars, and, going ashore at the bridge, make the 

best of their way to The Boot; where there was not only good 

entertainment and safe lodging, but where they would certainly be 

joined by many of their late companions.  Barnaby assenting, they 

decided on this course of action, and pulled for Blackfriars 

accordingly.



They landed at a critical time, and fortunately for themselves at 

the right moment.  For, coming into Fleet Street, they found it in 

an unusual stir; and inquiring the cause, were told that a body of 

Horse Guards had just galloped past, and that they were escorting 

some rioters whom they had made prisoners, to Newgate for safety.  

Not at all ill-pleased to have so narrowly escaped the cavalcade, 

they lost no more time in asking questions, but hurried to The Boot 

with as much speed as Hugh considered it prudent to make, without 

appearing singular or attracting an inconvenient share of public 

notice.
