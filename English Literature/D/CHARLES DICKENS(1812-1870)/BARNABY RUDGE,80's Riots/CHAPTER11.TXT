There was great news that night for the regular Maypole customers, 

to each of whom, as he straggled in to occupy his allotted seat in 

the chimney-corner, John, with a most impressive slowness of 

delivery, and in an apoplectic whisper, communicated the fact that 

Mr Chester was alone in the large room upstairs, and was waiting 

the arrival of Mr Geoffrey Haredale, to whom he had sent a letter 

(doubtless of a threatening nature) by the hands of Barnaby, then 

and there present.



For a little knot of smokers and solemn gossips, who had seldom any 

new topics of discussion, this was a perfect Godsend.  Here was a 

good, dark-looking mystery progressing under that very roof--

brought home to the fireside, as it were, and enjoyable without the 

smallest pains or trouble.  It is extraordinary what a zest and 

relish it gave to the drink, and how it heightened the flavour of 

the tobacco.  Every man smoked his pipe with a face of grave and 

serious delight, and looked at his neighbour with a sort of quiet 

congratulation.  Nay, it was felt to be such a holiday and special 

night, that, on the motion of little Solomon Daisy, every man 

(including John himself) put down his sixpence for a can of flip, 

which grateful beverage was brewed with all despatch, and set down 

in the midst of them on the brick floor; both that it might simmer 

and stew before the fire, and that its fragrant steam, rising up 

among them, and mixing with the wreaths of vapour from their pipes, 

might shroud them in a delicious atmosphere of their own, and shut 

out all the world.  The very furniture of the room seemed to 

mellow and deepen in its tone; the ceiling and walls looked 

blacker and more highly polished, the curtains of a ruddier red; 

the fire burnt clear and high, and the crickets in the hearthstone 

chirped with a more than wonted satisfaction.



There were present two, however, who showed but little interest in 

the general contentment.  Of these, one was Barnaby himself, who 

slept, or, to avoid being beset with questions, feigned to sleep, 

in the chimney-corner; the other, Hugh, who, sleeping too, lay 

stretched upon the bench on the opposite side, in the full glare of 

the blazing fire.



The light that fell upon this slumbering form, showed it in all its 

muscular and handsome proportions.  It was that of a young man, of 

a hale athletic figure, and a giant's strength, whose sunburnt face 

and swarthy throat, overgrown with jet black hair, might have 

served a painter for a model.  Loosely attired, in the coarsest and 

roughest garb, with scraps of straw and hay--his usual bed--

clinging here and there, and mingling with his uncombed locks, he 

had fallen asleep in a posture as careless as his dress.  The 

negligence and disorder of the whole man, with something fierce and 

sullen in his features, gave him a picturesque appearance, that 

attracted the regards even of the Maypole customers who knew him 

well, and caused Long Parkes to say that Hugh looked more like a 

poaching rascal to-night than ever he had seen him yet.



'He's waiting here, I suppose,' said Solomon, 'to take Mr 

Haredale's horse.'



'That's it, sir,' replied John Willet.  'He's not often in the 

house, you know.  He's more at his ease among horses than men.  I 

look upon him as a animal himself.'



Following up this opinion with a shrug that seemed meant to say, 

'we can't expect everybody to be like us,' John put his pipe into 

his mouth again, and smoked like one who felt his superiority over 

the general run of mankind.



'That chap, sir,' said John, taking it out again after a time, and 

pointing at him with the stem, 'though he's got all his faculties 

about him--bottled up and corked down, if I may say so, somewheres 

or another--'



'Very good!' said Parkes, nodding his head.  'A very good 

expression, Johnny.  You'll be a tackling somebody presently.  

You're in twig to-night, I see.'



'Take care,' said Mr Willet, not at all grateful for the 

compliment, 'that I don't tackle you, sir, which I shall certainly 

endeavour to do, if you interrupt me when I'm making observations.--

That chap, I was a saying, though he has all his faculties about 

him, somewheres or another, bottled up and corked down, has no more 

imagination than Barnaby has.  And why hasn't he?'



The three friends shook their heads at each other; saying by that 

action, without the trouble of opening their lips, 'Do you observe 

what a philosophical mind our friend has?'



'Why hasn't he?' said John, gently striking the table with his open 

hand.  'Because they was never drawed out of him when he was a 

boy.  That's why.  What would any of us have been, if our fathers 

hadn't drawed our faculties out of us?  What would my boy Joe have 

been, if I hadn't drawed his faculties out of him?--Do you mind 

what I'm a saying of, gentlemen?'



'Ah!  we mind you,' cried Parkes.  'Go on improving of us, Johnny.'



'Consequently, then,' said Mr Willet, 'that chap, whose mother was 

hung when he was a little boy, along with six others, for passing 

bad notes--and it's a blessed thing to think how many people are 

hung in batches every six weeks for that, and such like offences, 

as showing how wide awake our government is--that chap that was 

then turned loose, and had to mind cows, and frighten birds away, 

and what not, for a few pence to live on, and so got on by degrees 

to mind horses, and to sleep in course of time in lofts and litter, 

instead of under haystacks and hedges, till at last he come to be 

hostler at the Maypole for his board and lodging and a annual 

trifle--that chap that can't read nor write, and has never had much 

to do with anything but animals, and has never lived in any way but 

like the animals he has lived among, IS a animal.  And,' said Mr 

Willet, arriving at his logical conclusion, 'is to be treated 

accordingly.'



'Willet,' said Solomon Daisy, who had exhibited some impatience at 

the intrusion of so unworthy a subject on their more interesting 

theme, 'when Mr Chester come this morning, did he order the large 

room?'



'He signified, sir,' said John, 'that he wanted a large apartment.  

Yes.  Certainly.'



'Why then, I'll tell you what,' said Solomon, speaking softly and 

with an earnest look.  'He and Mr Haredale are going to fight a 

duel in it.'



Everybody looked at Mr Willet, after this alarming suggestion.  Mr 

Willet looked at the fire, weighing in his own mind the effect 

which such an occurrence would be likely to have on the establishment.



'Well,' said John, 'I don't know--I am sure--I remember that when I 

went up last, he HAD put the lights upon the mantel-shelf.'



'It's as plain,' returned Solomon, 'as the nose on Parkes's face'--

Mr Parkes, who had a large nose, rubbed it, and looked as if he 

considered this a personal allusion--'they'll fight in that room.  

You know by the newspapers what a common thing it is for gentlemen 

to fight in coffee-houses without seconds.  One of 'em will be 

wounded or perhaps killed in this house.'



'That was a challenge that Barnaby took then, eh?' said John.



'--Inclosing a slip of paper with the measure of his sword upon it, 

I'll bet a guinea,' answered the little man.  'We know what sort of 

gentleman Mr Haredale is.  You have told us what Barnaby said about 

his looks, when he came back.  Depend upon it, I'm right.  Now, 

mind.'



The flip had had no flavour till now.  The tobacco had been of mere 

English growth, compared with its present taste.  A duel in that 

great old rambling room upstairs, and the best bed ordered already 

for the wounded man!



'Would it be swords or pistols, now?' said John.



'Heaven knows.  Perhaps both,' returned Solomon.  'The gentlemen 

wear swords, and may easily have pistols in their pockets--most 

likely have, indeed.  If they fire at each other without effect, 

then they'll draw, and go to work in earnest.'



A shade passed over Mr Willet's face as he thought of broken 

windows and disabled furniture, but bethinking himself that one of 

the parties would probably be left alive to pay the damage, he 

brightened up again.



'And then,' said Solomon, looking from face to face, 'then we shall 

have one of those stains upon the floor that never come out.  If Mr 

Haredale wins, depend upon it, it'll be a deep one; or if he loses, 

it will perhaps be deeper still, for he'll never give in unless 

he's beaten down.  We know him better, eh?'



'Better indeed!' they whispered all together.



'As to its ever being got out again,' said Solomon, 'I tell you it 

never will, or can be.  Why, do you know that it has been tried, at 

a certain house we are acquainted with?'



'The Warren!' cried John.  'No, sure!'



'Yes, sure--yes.  It's only known by very few.  It has been 

whispered about though, for all that.  They planed the board away, 

but there it was.  They went deep, but it went deeper.  They put 

new boards down, but there was one great spot that came through 

still, and showed itself in the old place.  And--harkye--draw 

nearer--Mr Geoffrey made that room his study, and sits there, 

always, with his foot (as I have heard) upon it; and he believes, 

through thinking of it long and very much, that it will never fade 

until he finds the man who did the deed.'



As this recital ended, and they all drew closer round the fire, the 

tramp of a horse was heard without.



'The very man!' cried John, starting up.  'Hugh!  Hugh!'



The sleeper staggered to his feet, and hurried after him.  John 

quickly returned, ushering in with great attention and deference 

(for Mr Haredale was his landlord) the long-expected visitor, who 

strode into the room clanking his heavy boots upon the floor; and 

looking keenly round upon the bowing group, raised his hat in 

acknowledgment of their profound respect.



'You have a stranger here, Willet, who sent to me,' he said, in a 

voice which sounded naturally stern and deep.  'Where is he?'



'In the great room upstairs, sir,' answered John.



'Show the way.  Your staircase is dark, I know.  Gentlemen, good 

night.'



With that, he signed to the landlord to go on before; and went 

clanking out, and up the stairs; old John, in his agitation, 

ingeniously lighting everything but the way, and making a stumble 

at every second step.



'Stop!' he said, when they reached the landing.  'I can announce 

myself.  Don't wait.'



He laid his hand upon the door, entered, and shut it heavily.  Mr 

Willet was by no means disposed to stand there listening by 

himself, especially as the walls were very thick; so descended, 

with much greater alacrity than he had come up, and joined his 

friends below.
