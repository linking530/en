How the accomplished gentleman spent the evening in the midst of a 

dazzling and brilliant circle; how he enchanted all those with 

whom he mingled by the grace of his deportment, the politeness of 

his manner, the vivacity of his conversation, and the sweetness of 

his voice; how it was observed in every corner, that Chester was a 

man of that happy disposition that nothing ruffled him, that he was 

one on whom the world's cares and errors sat lightly as his dress, 

and in whose smiling face a calm and tranquil mind was constantly 

reflected; how honest men, who by instinct knew him better, 

bowed down before him nevertheless, deferred to his every word, and 

courted his favourable notice; how people, who really had good in 

them, went with the stream, and fawned and flattered, and approved, 

and despised themselves while they did so, and yet had not the 

courage to resist; how, in short, he was one of those who are 

received and cherished in society (as the phrase is) by scores who 

individually would shrink from and be repelled by the object of 

their lavish regard; are things of course, which will suggest 

themselves.  Matter so commonplace needs but a passing glance, and 

there an end.



The despisers of mankind--apart from the mere fools and mimics, of 

that creed--are of two sorts.  They who believe their merit 

neglected and unappreciated, make up one class; they who receive 

adulation and flattery, knowing their own worthlessness, compose 

the other.  Be sure that the coldest-hearted misanthropes are ever 

of this last order.



Mr Chester sat up in bed next morning, sipping his coffee, and 

remembering with a kind of contemptuous satisfaction how he had 

shone last night, and how he had been caressed and courted, when 

his servant brought in a very small scrap of dirty paper, tightly 

sealed in two places, on the inside whereof was inscribed in pretty 

large text these words: 'A friend.  Desiring of a conference.  

Immediate.  Private.  Burn it when you've read it.'



'Where in the name of the Gunpowder Plot did you pick up this?' 

said his master.



It was given him by a person then waiting at the door, the man 

replied.



'With a cloak and dagger?' said Mr Chester.



With nothing more threatening about him, it appeared, than a 

leather apron and a dirty face.  'Let him come in.'  In he came--Mr 

Tappertit; with his hair still on end, and a great lock in his 

hand, which he put down on the floor in the middle of the chamber 

as if he were about to go through some performances in which it was 

a necessary agent.



'Sir,' said Mr Tappertit with a low bow, 'I thank you for this 

condescension, and am glad to see you.  Pardon the menial office in 

which I am engaged, sir, and extend your sympathies to one, who, 

humble as his appearance is, has inn'ard workings far above his 

station.'



Mr Chester held the bed-curtain farther back, and looked at him 

with a vague impression that he was some maniac, who had not only 

broken open the door of his place of confinement, but had brought 

away the lock.  Mr Tappertit bowed again, and displayed his legs to 

the best advantage.



'You have heard, sir,' said Mr Tappertit, laying his hand upon his 

breast, 'of G. Varden Locksmith and bell-hanger and repairs neatly 

executed in town and country, Clerkenwell, London?'



'What then?' asked Mr Chester.



'I'm his 'prentice, sir.'



'What THEN?'



'Ahem!' said Mr Tappertit.  'Would you permit me to shut the door, 

sir, and will you further, sir, give me your honour bright, that 

what passes between us is in the strictest confidence?'



Mr Chester laid himself calmly down in bed again, and turning a 

perfectly undisturbed face towards the strange apparition, which 

had by this time closed the door, begged him to speak out, and to 

be as rational as he could, without putting himself to any very 

great personal inconvenience.



'In the first place, sir,' said Mr Tappertit, producing a small 

pocket-handkerchief and shaking it out of the folds, 'as I have not 

a card about me (for the envy of masters debases us below that 

level) allow me to offer the best substitute that circumstances 

will admit of.  If you will take that in your own hand, sir, and 

cast your eye on the right-hand corner,' said Mr Tappertit, 

offering it with a graceful air, 'you will meet with my 

credentials.'



'Thank you,' answered Mr Chester, politely accepting it, and 

turning to some blood-red characters at one end.  '"Four.  Simon 

Tappertit.  One."  Is that the--'



'Without the numbers, sir, that is my name,' replied the 'prentice.  

'They are merely intended as directions to the washerwoman, and 

have no connection with myself or family.  YOUR name, sir,' said Mr 

Tappertit, looking very hard at his nightcap, 'is Chester, I 

suppose?  You needn't pull it off, sir, thank you.  I observe E. C. 

from here.  We will take the rest for granted.'



'Pray, Mr Tappertit,' said Mr Chester, 'has that complicated piece 

of ironmongery which you have done me the favour to bring with you, 

any immediate connection with the business we are to discuss?'



'It has not, sir,' rejoined the 'prentice.  'It's going to be 

fitted on a ware'us-door in Thames Street.'



'Perhaps, as that is the case,' said Mr Chester, 'and as it has a 

stronger flavour of oil than I usually refresh my bedroom with, you 

will oblige me so far as to put it outside the door?'



'By all means, sir,' said Mr Tappertit, suiting the action to the 

word.



'You'll excuse my mentioning it, I hope?'



'Don't apologise, sir, I beg.  And now, if you please, to 

business.'



During the whole of this dialogue, Mr Chester had suffered nothing 

but his smile of unvarying serenity and politeness to appear upon 

his face.  Sim Tappertit, who had far too good an opinion of 

himself to suspect that anybody could be playing upon him, thought 

within himself that this was something like the respect to which he 

was entitled, and drew a comparison from this courteous demeanour 

of a stranger, by no means favourable to the worthy locksmith.



'From what passes in our house,' said Mr Tappertit, 'I am aware, 

sir, that your son keeps company with a young lady against your 

inclinations.  Sir, your son has not used me well.'



'Mr Tappertit,' said the other, 'you grieve me beyond description.'



'Thank you, sir,' replied the 'prentice.  'I'm glad to hear you say 

so.  He's very proud, sir, is your son; very haughty.'



'I am afraid he IS haughty,' said Mr Chester.  'Do you know I was 

really afraid of that before; and you confirm me?'



'To recount the menial offices I've had to do for your son, sir,' 

said Mr Tappertit; 'the chairs I've had to hand him, the coaches 

I've had to call for him, the numerous degrading duties, wholly 

unconnected with my indenters, that I've had to do for him, would 

fill a family Bible.  Besides which, sir, he is but a young man 

himself and I do not consider "thank'ee Sim," a proper form of 

address on those occasions.'



'Mr Tappertit, your wisdom is beyond your years.  Pray go on.'



'I thank you for your good opinion, sir,' said Sim, much gratified, 

'and will endeavour so to do.  Now sir, on this account (and 

perhaps for another reason or two which I needn't go into) I am on 

your side.  And what I tell you is this--that as long as our people 

go backwards and forwards, to and fro, up and down, to that there 

jolly old Maypole, lettering, and messaging, and fetching and 

carrying, you couldn't help your son keeping company with that 

young lady by deputy,--not if he was minded night and day by all 

the Horse Guards, and every man of 'em in the very fullest 

uniform.'



Mr Tappertit stopped to take breath after this, and then started 

fresh again.



'Now, sir, I am a coming to the point.  You will inquire of me, 

"how is this to he prevented?"  I'll tell you how.  If an honest, 


civil, smiling gentleman like you--'



'Mr Tappertit--really--'



'No, no, I'm serious,' rejoined the 'prentice, 'I am, upon my soul.  

If an honest, civil, smiling gentleman like you, was to talk but 

ten minutes to our old woman--that's Mrs Varden--and flatter her up 

a bit, you'd gain her over for ever.  Then there's this point got--

that her daughter Dolly,'--here a flush came over Mr Tappertit's 

face--'wouldn't be allowed to be a go-between from that time 

forward; and till that point's got, there's nothing ever will 

prevent her.  Mind that.'



'Mr Tappertit, your knowledge of human nature--'



'Wait a minute,' said Sim, folding his arms with a dreadful 

calmness.  'Now I come to THE point.  Sir, there is a villain at 

that Maypole, a monster in human shape, a vagabond of the deepest 

dye, that unless you get rid of and have kidnapped and carried off 

at the very least--nothing less will do--will marry your son to 

that young woman, as certainly and as surely as if he was the 

Archbishop of Canterbury himself.  He will, sir, for the hatred and 

malice that he bears to you; let alone the pleasure of doing a bad 

action, which to him is its own reward.  If you knew how this chap, 

this Joseph Willet--that's his name--comes backwards and forwards 

to our house, libelling, and denouncing, and threatening you, and 

how I shudder when I hear him, you'd hate him worse than I do,--

worse than I do, sir,' said Mr Tappertit wildly, putting his hair 

up straighter, and making a crunching noise with his teeth; 'if 

sich a thing is possible.'



'A little private vengeance in this, Mr Tappertit?'



'Private vengeance, sir, or public sentiment, or both combined--

destroy him,' said Mr Tappertit.  'Miggs says so too.  Miggs and me 

both say so.  We can't bear the plotting and undermining that takes 

place.  Our souls recoil from it.  Barnaby Rudge and Mrs Rudge are 

in it likewise; but the villain, Joseph Willet, is the ringleader.  

Their plottings and schemes are known to me and Miggs.  If you want 

information of 'em, apply to us.  Put Joseph Willet down, sir.  

Destroy him.  Crush him.  And be happy.'



With these words, Mr Tappertit, who seemed to expect no reply, and 

to hold it as a necessary consequence of his eloquence that his 

hearer should be utterly stunned, dumbfoundered, and overwhelmed, 

folded his arms so that the palm of each hand rested on the 

opposite shoulder, and disappeared after the manner of those 

mysterious warners of whom he had read in cheap story-books.



'That fellow,' said Mr Chester, relaxing his face when he was 

fairly gone, 'is good practice.  I HAVE some command of my 

features, beyond all doubt.  He fully confirms what I suspected, 

though; and blunt tools are sometimes found of use, where sharper 

instruments would fail.  I fear I may be obliged to make great 

havoc among these worthy people.  A troublesome necessity!  I 

quite feel for them.'



With that he fell into a quiet slumber:--subsided into such a 

gentle, pleasant sleep, that it was quite infantine.
