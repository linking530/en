A parting glance at such of the actors in this little history as 

it has not, in the course of its events, dismissed, will bring it 

to an end.



Mr Haredale fled that night.  Before pursuit could be begun, indeed 

before Sir John was traced or missed, he had left the kingdom.  

Repairing straight to a religious establishment, known throughout 

Europe for the rigour and severity of its discipline, and for the 

merciless penitence it exacted from those who sought its shelter as 

a refuge from the world, he took the vows which thenceforth shut 

him out from nature and his kind, and after a few remorseful years 

was buried in its gloomy cloisters.



Two days elapsed before the body of Sir John was found.  As soon as 

it was recognised and carried home, the faithful valet, true to his 

master's creed, eloped with all the cash and movables he could lay 

his hands on, and started as a finished gentleman upon his own 

account.  In this career he met with great success, and would 

certainly have married an heiress in the end, but for an unlucky 

check which led to his premature decease.  He sank under a 

contagious disorder, very prevalent at that time, and vulgarly 

termed the jail fever.



Lord George Gordon, remaining in his prison in the Tower until 

Monday the fifth of February in the following year, was on that 

day solemnly tried at Westminster for High Treason.  Of this crime 

he was, after a patient investigation, declared Not Guilty; upon 

the ground that there was no proof of his having called the 

multitude together with any traitorous or unlawful intentions.  Yet 

so many people were there, still, to whom those riots taught no 

lesson of reproof or moderation, that a public subscription was set 

on foot in Scotland to defray the cost of his defence.



For seven years afterwards he remained, at the strong intercession 

of his friends, comparatively quiet; saving that he, every now and 

then, took occasion to display his zeal for the Protestant faith in 

some extravagant proceeding which was the delight of its enemies; 

and saving, besides, that he was formally excommunicated by the 

Archbishop of Canterbury, for refusing to appear as a witness in 

the Ecclesiastical Court when cited for that purpose.  In the year 

1788 he was stimulated by some new insanity to write and publish 

an injurious pamphlet, reflecting on the Queen of France, in very 

violent terms.  Being indicted for the libel, and (after various 

strange demonstrations in court) found guilty, he fled into Holland 

in place of appearing to receive sentence: from whence, as the 

quiet burgomasters of Amsterdam had no relish for his company, 

he was sent home again with all speed.  Arriving in the month of 

July at Harwich, and going thence to Birmingham, he made in the 

latter place, in August, a public profession of the Jewish 

religion; and figured there as a Jew until he was arrested, and 

brought back to London to receive the sentence he had evaded.  By 

virtue of this sentence he was, in the month of December, cast 

into Newgate for five years and ten months, and required besides to 

pay a large fine, and to furnish heavy securities for his future 

good behaviour.



After addressing, in the midsummer of the following year, an appeal 

to the commiseration of the National Assembly of France, which the 

English minister refused to sanction, he composed himself to 

undergo his full term of punishment; and suffering his beard to 

grow nearly to his waist, and conforming in all respects to the 

ceremonies of his new religion, he applied himself to the study of 

history, and occasionally to the art of painting, in which, in his 

younger days, he had shown some skill.  Deserted by his former 

friends, and treated in all respects like the worst criminal in the 

jail, he lingered on, quite cheerful and resigned, until the 1st 

of November 1793, when he died in his cell, being then only three-

and-forty years of age.



Many men with fewer sympathies for the distressed and needy, with 

less abilities and harder hearts, have made a shining figure and 

left a brilliant fame.  He had his mourners.  The prisoners 

bemoaned his loss, and missed him; for though his means were not 

large, his charity was great, and in bestowing alms among them he 

considered the necessities of all alike, and knew no distinction of 

sect or creed.  There are wise men in the highways of the world who 

may learn something, even from this poor crazy lord who died in 

Newgate.



To the last, he was truly served by bluff John Grueby.  John was at 

his side before he had been four-and-twenty hours in the Tower, and 

never left him until he died.  He had one other constant attendant, 

in the person of a beautiful Jewish girl; who attached herself to 

him from feelings half religious, half romantic, but whose virtuous 

and disinterested character appears to have been beyond the censure 

even of the most censorious.



Gashford deserted him, of course.  He subsisted for a time upon his 

traffic in his master's secrets; and, this trade failing when the 

stock was quite exhausted, procured an appointment in the 

honourable corps of spies and eavesdroppers employed by the 

government.  As one of these wretched underlings, he did his 

drudgery, sometimes abroad, sometimes at home, and long endured the 

various miseries of such a station.  Ten or a dozen years ago--not 

more--a meagre, wan old man, diseased and miserably poor, was found 

dead in his bed at an obscure inn in the Borough, where he was 

quite unknown.  He had taken poison.  There was no clue to his 

name; but it was discovered from certain entries in a pocket-book 

he carried, that he had been secretary to Lord George Gordon in the 

time of the famous riots.



Many months after the re-establishment of peace and order, and even 

when it had ceased to be the town-talk, that every military 

officer, kept at free quarters by the City during the late alarms, 

had cost for his board and lodging four pounds four per day, and 

every private soldier two and twopence halfpenny; many months after 

even this engrossing topic was forgotten, and the United Bulldogs 

were to a man all killed, imprisoned, or transported, Mr Simon 

Tappertit, being removed from a hospital to prison, and thence to 

his place of trial, was discharged by proclamation, on two wooden 

legs.  Shorn of his graceful limbs, and brought down from his high 

estate to circumstances of utter destitution, and the deepest 

misery, he made shift to stump back to his old master, and beg for 

some relief.  By the locksmith's advice and aid, he was established 

in business as a shoeblack, and opened shop under an archway near 

the Horse Guards.  This being a central quarter, he quickly made a 

very large connection; and on levee days, was sometimes known to 

have as many as twenty half-pay officers waiting their turn for 

polishing.  Indeed his trade increased to that extent, that in 

course of time he entertained no less than two apprentices, besides 

taking for his wife the widow of an eminent bone and rag collector, 

formerly of MilIbank.  With this lady (who assisted in the 

business) he lived in great domestic happiness, only chequered by 

those little storms which serve to clear the atmosphere of wedlock, 

and brighten its horizon.  In some of these gusts of bad weather, 

Mr Tappertit would, in the assertion of his prerogative, so far 

forget himself, as to correct his lady with a brush, or boot, or 

shoe; while she (but only in extreme cases) would retaliate by 

taking off his legs, and leaving him exposed to the derision of 

those urchins who delight in mischief.



Miss Miggs, baffled in all her schemes, matrimonial and otherwise, 

and cast upon a thankless, undeserving world, turned very sharp and 

sour; and did at length become so acid, and did so pinch and slap 

and tweak the hair and noses of the youth of Golden Lion Court, 

that she was by one consent expelled that sanctuary, and desired to 

bless some other spot of earth, in preference.  It chanced at that 

moment, that the justices of the peace for Middlesex proclaimed by 

public placard that they stood in need of a female turnkey for the 

County Bridewell, and appointed a day and hour for the inspection 

of candidates.  Miss Miggs attending at the time appointed, was 

instantly chosen and selected from one hundred and twenty-four 

competitors, and at once promoted to the office; which she held 

until her decease, more than thirty years afterwards, remaining 

single all that time.  It was observed of this lady that while she 

was inflexible and grim to all her female flock, she was 

particularly so to those who could establish any claim to beauty: 

and it was often remarked as a proof of her indomitable virtue and 

severe chastity, that to such as had been frail she showed no 

mercy; always falling upon them on the slightest occasion, or on no 

occasion at all, with the fullest measure of her wrath.  Among 

other useful inventions which she practised upon this class of 

offenders and bequeathed to posterity, was the art of inflicting an 

exquisitely vicious poke or dig with the wards of a key in the 

small of the back, near the spine.  She likewise originated a mode 

of treading by accident (in pattens) on such as had small feet; 

also very remarkable for its ingenuity, and previously quite 

unknown.



It was not very long, you may be sure, before Joe Willet and Dolly 

Varden were made husband and wife, and with a handsome sum in bank 

(for the locksmith could afford to give his daughter a good dowry), 

reopened the Maypole.  It was not very long, you may be sure, 

before a red-faced little boy was seen staggering about the Maypole 

passage, and kicking up his heels on the green before the door.  It 

was not very long, counting by years, before there was a red-faced 

little girl, another red-faced little boy, and a whole troop of 

girls and boys: so that, go to Chigwell when you would, there would 

surely be seen, either in the village street, or on the green, or 

frolicking in the farm-yard--for it was a farm now, as well as a 

tavern--more small Joes and small Dollys than could be easily 

counted.  It was not a very long time before these appearances 

ensued; but it WAS a VERY long time before Joe looked five years 

older, or Dolly either, or the locksmith either, or his wife 

either: for cheerfulness and content are great beautifiers, and 

are famous preservers of youthful looks, depend upon it.



It was a long time, too, before there was such a country inn as the 

Maypole, in all England: indeed it is a great question whether 

there has ever been such another to this hour, or ever will be.  It 

was a long time too--for Never, as the proverb says, is a long day--

before they forgot to have an interest in wounded soldiers at the 

Maypole, or before Joe omitted to refresh them, for the sake of his 

old campaign; or before the serjeant left off looking in there, now 

and then; or before they fatigued themselves, or each other, by 

talking on these occasions of battles and sieges, and hard weather 

and hard service, and a thousand things belonging to a soldier's 

life.  As to the great silver snuff-box which the King sent Joe 

with his own hand, because of his conduct in the Riots, what guest 

ever went to the Maypole without putting finger and thumb into that 

box, and taking a great pinch, though he had never taken a pinch of 

snuff before, and almost sneezed himself into convulsions even 

then?  As to the purple-faced vintner, where is the man who lived 

in those times and never saw HIM at the Maypole: to all appearance 

as much at home in the best room, as if he lived there?  And as to 

the feastings and christenings, and revellings at Christmas, and 

celebrations of birthdays, wedding-days, and all manner of days, 

both at the Maypole and the Golden Key,--if they are not notorious, 

what facts are?



Mr Willet the elder, having been by some extraordinary means 

possessed with the idea that Joe wanted to be married, and that it 

would be well for him, his father, to retire into private life, and 

enable him to live in comfort, took up his abode in a small cottage 

at Chigwell; where they widened and enlarged the fireplace for him, 

hung up the boiler, and furthermore planted in the little garden 

outside the front-door, a fictitious Maypole; so that he was quite 

at home directly.  To this, his new habitation, Tom Cobb, Phil 

Parkes, and Solomon Daisy went regularly every night: and in the 

chimney-corner, they all four quaffed, and smoked, and prosed, and 

dozed, as they had done of old.  It being accidentally discovered 

after a short time that Mr Willet still appeared to consider 

himself a landlord by profession, Joe provided him with a slate, 

upon which the old man regularly scored up vast accounts for meat, 

drink, and tobacco.  As he grew older this passion increased upon 

him; and it became his delight to chalk against the name of each of 

his cronies a sum of enormous magnitude, and impossible to be paid: 

and such was his secret joy in these entries, that he would be 

perpetually seen going behind the door to look at them, and coming 

forth again, suffused with the liveliest satisfaction.



He never recovered the surprise the Rioters had given him, and 

remained in the same mental condition down to the last moment of 

his life.  It was like to have been brought to a speedy 

termination by the first sight of his first grandchild, which 

appeared to fill him with the belief that some alarming miracle had 

happened to Joe.  Being promptly blooded, however, by a skilful 

surgeon, he rallied; and although the doctors all agreed, on his 

being attacked with symptoms of apoplexy six months afterwards, 

that he ought to die, and took it very ill that he did not, he 

remained alive--possibly on account of his constitutional slowness--

for nearly seven years more, when he was one morning found 

speechless in his bed.  He lay in this state, free from all tokens 

of uneasiness, for a whole week, when he was suddenly restored to 

consciousness by hearing the nurse whisper in his son's ear that he 

was going.  'I'm a-going, Joseph,' said Mr Willet, turning round 

upon the instant, 'to the Salwanners'--and immediately gave up 

the ghost.



He left a large sum of money behind him; even more than he was 

supposed to have been worth, although the neighbours, according to 

the custom of mankind in calculating the wealth that other people 

ought to have saved, had estimated his property in good round 

numbers.  Joe inherited the whole; so that he became a man of great 

consequence in those parts, and was perfectly independent.



Some time elapsed before Barnaby got the better of the shock he had 

sustained, or regained his old health and gaiety.  But he recovered 

by degrees: and although he could never separate his condemnation 

and escape from the idea of a terrific dream, he became, in other 

respects, more rational.  Dating from the time of his recovery, he 

had a better memory and greater steadiness of purpose; but a dark 

cloud overhung his whole previous existence, and never cleared 

away.



He was not the less happy for this, for his love of freedom and 

interest in all that moved or grew, or had its being in the 

elements, remained to him unimpaired.  He lived with his mother on 

the Maypole farm, tending the poultry and the cattle, working in a 

garden of his own, and helping everywhere.  He was known to every 

bird and beast about the place, and had a name for every one.  

Never was there a lighter-hearted husbandman, a creature more 

popular with young and old, a blither or more happy soul than 

Barnaby; and though he was free to ramble where he would, he never 

quitted Her, but was for evermore her stay and comfort.



It was remarkable that although he had that dim sense of the past, 

he sought out Hugh's dog, and took him under his care; and that he 

never could be tempted into London.  When the Riots were many years 

old, and Edward and his wife came back to England with a family 

almost as numerous as Dolly's, and one day appeared at the Maypole 

porch, he knew them instantly, and wept and leaped for joy.  But 

neither to visit them, nor on any other pretence, no matter how 

full of promise and enjoyment, could he be persuaded to set foot in 

the streets: nor did he ever conquer this repugnance or look upon 

the town again.



Grip soon recovered his looks, and became as glossy and sleek as 

ever.  But he was profoundly silent.  Whether he had forgotten the 

art of Polite Conversation in Newgate, or had made a vow in those 

troubled times to forego, for a period, the display of his 

accomplishments, is matter of uncertainty; but certain it is that 

for a whole year he never indulged in any other sound than a grave, 

decorous croak.  At the expiration of that term, the morning being 

very bright and sunny, he was heard to address himself to the 

horses in the stable, upon the subject of the Kettle, so often 

mentioned in these pages; and before the witness who overheard him 

could run into the house with the intelligence, and add to it upon 

his solemn affirmation the statement that he had heard him laugh, 

the bird himself advanced with fantastic steps to the very door of 

the bar, and there cried, 'I'm a devil, I'm a devil, I'm a devil!' 

with extraordinary rapture.



From that period (although he was supposed to be much affected by 

the death of Mr Willet senior), he constantly practised and 

improved himself in the vulgar tongue; and, as he was a mere infant 

for a raven when Barnaby was grey, he has very probably gone on 

talking to the present time.
