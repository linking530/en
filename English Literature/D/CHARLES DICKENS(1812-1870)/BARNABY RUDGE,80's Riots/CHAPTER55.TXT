John Willet, left alone in his dismantled bar, continued to sit 

staring about him; awake as to his eyes, certainly, but with all 

his powers of reason and reflection in a sound and dreamless 

sleep.  He looked round upon the room which had been for years, 

and was within an hour ago, the pride of his heart; and not a 

muscle of his face was moved.  The night, without, looked black and 

cold through the dreary gaps in the casement; the precious liquids, 

now nearly leaked away, dripped with a hollow sound upon the floor; 

the Maypole peered ruefully in through the broken window, like the 

bowsprit of a wrecked ship; the ground might have been the bottom 

of the sea, it was so strewn with precious fragments.  Currents of 

air rushed in, as the old doors jarred and creaked upon their 

hinges; the candles flickered and guttered down, and made long 

winding-sheets; the cheery deep-red curtains flapped and fluttered 

idly in the wind; even the stout Dutch kegs, overthrown and lying 

empty in dark corners, seemed the mere husks of good fellows whose 

jollity had departed, and who could kindle with a friendly glow no 

more.  John saw this desolation, and yet saw it not.  He was 

perfectly contented to sit there, staring at it, and felt no more 

indignation or discomfort in his bonds than if they had been robes 

of honour.  So far as he was personally concerned, old Time lay 

snoring, and the world stood still.



Save for the dripping from the barrels, the rustling of such light 

fragments of destruction as the wind affected, and the dull 

creaking of the open doors, all was profoundly quiet: indeed, 

these sounds, like the ticking of the death-watch in the night, 

only made the silence they invaded deeper and more apparent.  But 

quiet or noisy, it was all one to John.  If a train of heavy 

artillery could have come up and commenced ball practice outside 

the window, it would have been all the same to him.  He was a long 

way beyond surprise.  A ghost couldn't have overtaken him.



By and by he heard a footstep--a hurried, and yet cautious 

footstep--coming on towards the house.  It stopped, advanced again, 

then seemed to go quite round it.  Having done that, it came 

beneath the window, and a head looked in.



It was strongly relieved against the darkness outside by the glare 

of the guttering candles.  A pale, worn, withered face; the eyes--

but that was owing to its gaunt condition--unnaturally large and 

bright; the hair, a grizzled black.  It gave a searching glance all 

round the room, and a deep voice said:



'Are you alone in this house?'



John made no sign, though the question was repeated twice, and he 

heard it distinctly.  After a moment's pause, the man got in at the 

window.  John was not at all surprised at this, either.  There had 

been so much getting in and out of window in the course of the last 

hour or so, that he had quite forgotten the door, and seemed to 

have lived among such exercises from infancy.



The man wore a large, dark, faded cloak, and a slouched hat; he 

walked up close to John, and looked at him.  John returned the 

compliment with interest.



'How long have you been sitting thus?' said the man.



John considered, but nothing came of it.



'Which way have the party gone?'



Some wandering speculations relative to the fashion of the 

stranger's boots, got into Mr Willet's mind by some accident or 

other, but they got out again in a hurry, and left him in his 

former state.



'You would do well to speak,' said the man; 'you may keep a whole 

skin, though you have nothing else left that can be hurt.  Which 

way have the party gone?'



'That!' said John, finding his voice all at once, and nodding with 

perfect good faith--he couldn't point; he was so tightly bound--in 

exactly the opposite direction to the right one.



'You lie!' said the man angrily, and with a threatening gesture.  

'I came that way.  You would betray me.'



It was so evident that John's imperturbability was not assumed, but 

was the result of the late proceedings under his roof, that the man 

stayed his hand in the very act of striking him, and turned away.



John looked after him without so much as a twitch in a single nerve 

of his face.  He seized a glass, and holding it under one of the 

little casks until a few drops were collected, drank them greedily 

off; then throwing it down upon the floor impatiently, he took the 

vessel in his hands and drained it into his throat.  Some scraps of 

bread and meat were scattered about, and on these he fell next; 

eating them with voracity, and pausing every now and then to 

listen for some fancied noise outside.  When he had refreshed 

himself in this manner with violent haste, and raised another 

barrel to his lips, he pulled his hat upon his brow as though he 

were about to leave the house, and turned to John.



'Where are your servants?'



Mr Willet indistinctly remembered to have heard the rioters calling 

to them to throw the key of the room in which they were, out of 

window, for their keeping.  He therefore replied, 'Locked up.'



'Well for them if they remain quiet, and well for you if you do the 

like,' said the man.  'Now show me the way the party went.'



This time Mr Willet indicated it correctly.  The man was hurrying 

to the door, when suddenly there came towards them on the wind, the 

loud and rapid tolling of an alarm-bell, and then a bright and 

vivid glare streamed up, which illumined, not only the whole 

chamber, but all the country.



It was not the sudden change from darkness to this dreadful light, 

it was not the sound of distant shrieks and shouts of triumph, it 

was not this dread invasion of the serenity and peace of night, 

that drove the man back as though a thunderbolt had struck him.  It 

was the Bell.  If the ghastliest shape the human mind has ever 

pictured in its wildest dreams had risen up before him, he could 

not have staggered backward from its touch, as he did from the 

first sound of that loud iron voice.  With eyes that started from 

his head, his limbs convulsed, his face most horrible to see, he 

raised one arm high up into the air, and holding something 

visionary back and down, with his other hand, drove at it as though 

he held a knife and stabbed it to the heart.  He clutched his hair, 

and stopped his ears, and travelled madly round and round; then 

gave a frightful cry, and with it rushed away: still, still, the 

Bell tolled on and seemed to follow him--louder and louder, hotter 

and hotter yet.  The glare grew brighter, the roar of voices 

deeper; the crash of heavy bodies falling, shook the air; bright 

streams of sparks rose up into the sky; but louder than them all--

rising faster far, to Heaven--a million times more fierce and 

furious--pouring forth dreadful secrets after its long silence--

speaking the language of the dead--the Bell--the Bell!



What hunt of spectres could surpass that dread pursuit and flight!  

Had there been a legion of them on his track, he could have better 

borne it.  They would have had a beginning and an end, but here all 

space was full.  The one pursuing voice was everywhere: it sounded 

in the earth, the air; shook the long grass, and howled among the 

trembling trees.  The echoes caught it up, the owls hooted as it 

flew upon the breeze, the nightingale was silent and hid herself 

among the thickest boughs: it seemed to goad and urge the angry 

fire, and lash it into madness; everything was steeped in one 

prevailing red; the glow was everywhere; nature was drenched in 

blood: still the remorseless crying of that awful voice--the Bell, 

the Bell!



It ceased; but not in his ears.  The knell was at his heart.  No 

work of man had ever voice like that which sounded there, and 

warned him that it cried unceasingly to Heaven.  Who could hear 

that hell, and not know what it said!  There was murder in its 

every note--cruel, relentless, savage murder--the murder of a 

confiding man, by one who held his every trust.  Its ringing 

summoned phantoms from their graves.  What face was that, in which 

a friendly smile changed to a look of half incredulous horror, 

which stiffened for a moment into one of pain, then changed again 

into an imploring glance at Heaven, and so fell idly down with 

upturned eyes, like the dead stags' he had often peeped at when a 

little child: shrinking and shuddering--there was a dreadful thing 

to think of now!--and clinging to an apron as he looked!  He sank 

upon the ground, and grovelling down as if he would dig himself a 

place to hide in, covered his face and ears: but no, no, no,--a 

hundred walls and roofs of brass would not shut out that bell, for 

in it spoke the wrathful voice of God, and from that voice, the 

whole wide universe could not afford a refuge!



While he rushed up and down, not knowing where to turn, and while 

he lay crouching there, the work went briskly on indeed.  When 

they left the Maypole, the rioters formed into a solid body, and 

advanced at a quick pace towards the Warren.  Rumour of their 

approach having gone before, they found the garden-doors fast 

closed, the windows made secure, and the house profoundly dark: not 

a light being visible in any portion of the building.  After some 

fruitless ringing at the bells, and beating at the iron gates, they 

drew off a few paces to reconnoitre, and confer upon the course it 

would be best to take.



Very little conference was needed, when all were bent upon one 

desperate purpose, infuriated with liquor, and flushed with 

successful riot.  The word being given to surround the house, some 

climbed the gates, or dropped into the shallow trench and scaled 

the garden wall, while others pulled down the solid iron fence, and 

while they made a breach to enter by, made deadly weapons of the 

bars.  The house being completely encircled, a small number of men 

were despatched to break open a tool-shed in the garden; and during 

their absence on this errand, the remainder contented themselves 

with knocking violently at the doors, and calling to those within, 

to come down and open them on peril of their lives.



No answer being returned to this repeated summons, and the 

detachment who had been sent away, coming back with an accession of 

pickaxes, spades, and hoes, they,--together with those who had such 

arms already, or carried (as many did) axes, poles, and crowbars,--

struggled into the foremost rank, ready to beset the doors and 

windows.  They had not at this time more than a dozen lighted 

torches among them; but when these preparations were completed, 

flaming links were distributed and passed from hand to hand with 

such rapidity, that, in a minute's time, at least two-thirds of the 

whole roaring mass bore, each man in his hand, a blazing brand.  

Whirling these about their heads they raised a loud shout, and fell 

to work upon the doors and windows.



Amidst the clattering of heavy blows, the rattling of broken glass, 

the cries and execrations of the mob, and all the din and turmoil 

of the scene, Hugh and his friends kept together at the turret-door 

where Mr Haredale had last admitted him and old John Willet; and 

spent their united force on that.  It was a strong old oaken door, 

guarded by good bolts and a heavy bar, but it soon went crashing in 

upon the narrow stairs behind, and made, as it were, a platform to 

facilitate their tearing up into the rooms above.  Almost at the 

same moment, a dozen other points were forced, and at every one the 

crowd poured in like water.



A few armed servant-men were posted in the hall, and when the 

rioters forced an entrance there, they fired some half-a-dozen 

shots.  But these taking no effect, and the concourse coming on 

like an army of devils, they only thought of consulting their own 

safety, and retreated, echoing their assailants' cries, and hoping 

in the confusion to be taken for rioters themselves; in which 

stratagem they succeeded, with the exception of one old man who was 

never heard of again, and was said to have had his brains beaten 

out with an iron bar (one of his fellows reported that he had seen 

the old man fall), and to have been afterwards burnt in the flames.



The besiegers being now in complete possession of the house, spread 

themselves over it from garret to cellar, and plied their demon 

labours fiercely.  While some small parties kindled bonfires 

underneath the windows, others broke up the furniture and cast the 

fragments down to feed the flames below; where the apertures in 

the wall (windows no longer) were large enough, they threw out 

tables, chests of drawers, beds, mirrors, pictures, and flung them 

whole into the fire; while every fresh addition to the blazing 

masses was received with shouts, and howls, and yells, which added 

new and dismal terrors to the conflagration.  Those who had axes 

and had spent their fury on the movables, chopped and tore down the 

doors and window frames, broke up the flooring, hewed away the 

rafters, and buried men who lingered in the upper rooms, in heaps 

of ruins.  Some searched the drawers, the chests, the boxes, 

writing-desks, and closets, for jewels, plate, and money; while 

others, less mindful of gain and more mad for destruction, cast 

their whole contents into the courtyard without examination, and 

called to those below, to heap them on the blaze.  Men who had 

been into the cellars, and had staved the casks, rushed to and fro 

stark mad, setting fire to all they saw--often to the dresses of 

their own friends--and kindling the building in so many parts that 

some had no time for escape, and were seen, with drooping hands and 

blackened faces, hanging senseless on the window-sills to which 

they had crawled, until they were sucked and drawn into the 

burning gulf.  The more the fire crackled and raged, the wilder and 

more cruel the men grew; as though moving in that element they 

became fiends, and changed their earthly nature for the qualities 

that give delight in hell.



The burning pile, revealing rooms and passages red hot, through 

gaps made in the crumbling walls; the tributary fires that licked 

the outer bricks and stones, with their long forked tongues, and 

ran up to meet the glowing mass within; the shining of the flames 

upon the villains who looked on and fed them; the roaring of the 

angry blaze, so bright and high that it seemed in its rapacity to 

have swallowed up the very smoke; the living flakes the wind bore 

rapidly away and hurried on with, like a storm of fiery snow; the 

noiseless breaking of great beams of wood, which fell like feathers 

on the heap of ashes, and crumbled in the very act to sparks and 

powder; the lurid tinge that overspread the sky, and the darkness, 

very deep by contrast, which prevailed around; the exposure to the 

coarse, common gaze, of every little nook which usages of home had 

made a sacred place, and the destruction by rude hands of every 

little household favourite which old associations made a dear and 

precious thing: all this taking place--not among pitying looks and 

friendly murmurs of compassion, but brutal shouts and exultations, 

which seemed to make the very rats who stood by the old house too 

long, creatures with some claim upon the pity and regard of those 

its roof had sheltered:--combined to form a scene never to be 

forgotten by those who saw it and were not actors in the work, so 

long as life endured.



And who were they?  The alarm-bell rang--and it was pulled by no 

faint or hesitating hands--for a long time; but not a soul was 

seen.  Some of the insurgents said that when it ceased, they heard 

the shrieks of women, and saw some garments fluttering in the air, 

as a party of men bore away no unresisting burdens.  No one could 

say that this was true or false, in such an uproar; but where was 

Hugh?  Who among them had seen him, since the forcing of the doors?  

The cry spread through the body.  Where was Hugh!



'Here!' he hoarsely cried, appearing from the darkness; out of 

breath, and blackened with the smoke.  'We have done all we can; 

the fire is burning itself out; and even the corners where it 

hasn't spread, are nothing but heaps of ruins.  Disperse, my lads, 

while the coast's clear; get back by different ways; and meet as 

usual!'  With that, he disappeared again,--contrary to his wont, 

for he was always first to advance, and last to go away,--leaving 

them to follow homewards as they would.



It was not an easy task to draw off such a throng.  If Bedlam gates 

had been flung wide open, there would not have issued forth such 

maniacs as the frenzy of that night had made.  There were men 

there, who danced and trampled on the beds of flowers as though 

they trod down human enemies, and wrenched them from the stalks, 

like savages who twisted human necks.  There were men who cast 

their lighted torches in the air, and suffered them to fall upon 

their heads and faces, blistering the skin with deep unseemly 

burns.  There were men who rushed up to the fire, and paddled in it 

with their hands as if in water; and others who were restrained by 

force from plunging in, to gratify their deadly longing.  On the 

skull of one drunken lad--not twenty, by his looks--who lay upon 

the ground with a bottle to his mouth, the lead from the roof came 

streaming down in a shower of liquid fire, white hot; melting his 

head like wax.  When the scattered parties were collected, men--

living yet, but singed as with hot irons--were plucked out of the 

cellars, and carried off upon the shoulders of others, who strove 

to wake them as they went along, with ribald jokes, and left them, 

dead, in the passages of hospitals.  But of all the howling throng 

not one learnt mercy from, or sickened at, these sights; nor was 

the fierce, besotted, senseless rage of one man glutted.



Slowly, and in small clusters, with hoarse hurrahs and repetitions 

of their usual cry, the assembly dropped away.  The last few red-

eyed stragglers reeled after those who had gone before; the distant 

noise of men calling to each other, and whistling for others whom 

they missed, grew fainter and fainter; at length even these sounds 

died away, and silence reigned alone.



Silence indeed!  The glare of the flames had sunk into a fitful, 

flashing light; and the gentle stars, invisible till now, looked 

down upon the blackening heap.  A dull smoke hung upon the ruin, as 

though to hide it from those eyes of Heaven; and the wind forbore 

to move it.  Bare walls, roof open to the sky--chambers, where the 

beloved dead had, many and many a fair day, risen to new life and 

energy; where so many dear ones had been sad and merry; which were 

connected with so many thoughts and hopes, regrets and changes--all 

gone.  Nothing left but a dull and dreary blank--a smouldering heap 

of dust and ashes--the silence and solitude of utter desolation.
