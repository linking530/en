The time wore on.  The noises in the streets became less frequent 

by degrees, until silence was scarcely broken save by the bells in 

church towers, marking the progress--softer and more stealthy 

while the city slumbered--of that Great Watcher with the hoary 

head, who never sleeps or rests.  In the brief interval of darkness 

and repose which feverish towns enjoy, all busy sounds were hushed; 

and those who awoke from dreams lay listening in their beds, and 

longed for dawn, and wished the dead of the night were past.



Into the street outside the jail's main wall, workmen came 

straggling at this solemn hour, in groups of two or three, and 

meeting in the centre, cast their tools upon the ground and spoke 

in whispers.  Others soon issued from the jail itself, bearing on 

their shoulders planks and beams: these materials being all brought 

forth, the rest bestirred themselves, and the dull sound of hammers 

began to echo through the stillness.



Here and there among this knot of labourers, one, with a lantern or 

a smoky link, stood by to light his fellows at their work; and by 

its doubtful aid, some might be dimly seen taking up the pavement 

of the road, while others held great upright posts, or fixed them 

in the holes thus made for their reception.  Some dragged slowly 

on, towards the rest, an empty cart, which they brought rumbling 

from the prison-yard; while others erected strong barriers across 

the street.  All were busily engaged.  Their dusky figures moving 

to and fro, at that unusual hour, so active and so silent, might 

have been taken for those of shadowy creatures toiling at midnight 

on some ghostly unsubstantial work, which, like themselves, would 

vanish with the first gleam of day, and leave but morning mist and 

vapour.



While it was yet dark, a few lookers-on collected, who had plainly 

come there for the purpose and intended to remain: even those who 

had to pass the spot on their way to some other place, lingered, 

and lingered yet, as though the attraction of that were 

irresistible.  Meanwhile the noise of saw and mallet went on 

briskly, mingled with the clattering of boards on the stone 

pavement of the road, and sometimes with the workmen's voices as 

they called to one another.  Whenever the chimes of the 

neighbouring church were heard--and that was every quarter of an 

hour--a strange sensation, instantaneous and indescribable, but 

perfectly obvious, seemed to pervade them all.



Gradually, a faint brightness appeared in the east, and the air, 

which had been very warm all through the night, felt cool and 

chilly.  Though there was no daylight yet, the darkness was 

diminished, and the stars looked pale.  The prison, which had been 

a mere black mass with little shape or form, put on its usual 

aspect; and ever and anon a solitary watchman could be seen upon 

its roof, stopping to look down upon the preparations in the 

street.  This man, from forming, as it were, a part of the jail, 

and knowing or being supposed to know all that was passing within, 

became an object of as much interest, and was as eagerly looked 

for, and as awfully pointed out, as if he had been a spirit.



By and by, the feeble light grew stronger, and the houses with 

their signboards and inscriptions, stood plainly out, in the dull 

grey morning.  Heavy stage waggons crawled from the inn-yard 

opposite; and travellers peeped out; and as they rolled sluggishly 

away, cast many a backward look towards the jail.  And now, the 

sun's first beams came glancing into the street; and the night's 

work, which, in its various stages and in the varied fancies of the 

lookers-on had taken a hundred shapes, wore its own proper form--a 

scaffold, and a gibbet.



As the warmth of the cheerful day began to shed itself upon the 

scanty crowd, the murmur of tongues was heard, shutters were thrown 

open, and blinds drawn up, and those who had slept in rooms over 

against the prison, where places to see the execution were let at 

high prices, rose hastily from their beds.  In some of the houses, 

people were busy taking out the window-sashes for the better 

accommodation of spectators; in others, the spectators were already 

seated, and beguiling the time with cards, or drink, or jokes among 

themselves.  Some had purchased seats upon the house-tops, and 

were already crawling to their stations from parapet and garret-

window.  Some were yet bargaining for good places, and stood in 

them in a state of indecision: gazing at the slowly-swelling crowd, 

and at the workmen as they rested listlessly against the scaffold--

affecting to listen with indifference to the proprietor's eulogy of 

the commanding view his house afforded, and the surpassing 

cheapness of his terms.



A fairer morning never shone.  From the roofs and upper stories of 

these buildings, the spires of city churches and the great 

cathedral dome were visible, rising up beyond the prison, into the 

blue sky, and clad in the colour of light summer clouds, and 

showing in the clear atmosphere their every scrap of tracery and 

fretwork, and every niche and loophole.  All was brightness and 

promise, excepting in the street below, into which (for it yet lay 

in shadow) the eye looked down as into a dark trench, where, in the 

midst of so much life, and hope, and renewal of existence, stood 

the terrible instrument of death.  It seemed as if the very sun 

forbore to look upon it.



But it was better, grim and sombre in the shade, than when, the day 

being more advanced, it stood confessed in the full glare and glory 

of the sun, with its black paint blistering, and its nooses 

dangling in the light like loathsome garlands.  It was better in 

the solitude and gloom of midnight with a few forms clustering 

about it, than in the freshness and the stir of morning: the centre 

of an eager crowd.  It was better haunting the street like a 

spectre, when men were in their beds, and influencing perchance the 

city's dreams, than braving the broad day, and thrusting its 

obscene presence upon their waking senses.



Five o'clock had struck--six--seven--and eight.  Along the two main 

streets at either end of the cross-way, a living stream had now 

set in, rolling towards the marts of gain and business.  Carts, 

coaches, waggons, trucks, and barrows, forced a passage through the 

outskirts of the throng, and clattered onward in the same 

direction.  Some of these which were public conveyances and had 

come from a short distance in the country, stopped; and the driver 

pointed to the gibbet with his whip, though he might have spared 

himself the pains, for the heads of all the passengers were turned 

that way without his help, and the coach-windows were stuck full of 

staring eyes.  In some of the carts and waggons, women might be 

seen, glancing fearfully at the same unsightly thing; and even 

little children were held up above the people's heads to see what 

kind of a toy a gallows was, and learn how men were hanged.



Two rioters were to die before the prison, who had been concerned 

in the attack upon it; and one directly afterwards in Bloomsbury 

Square.  At nine o'clock, a strong body of military marched into 

the street, and formed and lined a narrow passage into Holborn, 

which had been indifferently kept all night by constables.  Through 

this, another cart was brought (the one already mentioned had been 

employed in the construction of the scaffold), and wheeled up to 

the prison-gate.  These preparations made, the soldiers stood at 

ease; the officers lounged to and fro, in the alley they had made, 

or talked together at the scaffold's foot; and the concourse, 

which had been rapidly augmenting for some hours, and still 

received additions every minute, waited with an impatience which 

increased with every chime of St Sepulchre's clock, for twelve at 

noon.



Up to this time they had been very quiet, comparatively silent, 

save when the arrival of some new party at a window, hitherto 

unoccupied, gave them something new to look at or to talk of.  But, 

as the hour approached, a buzz and hum arose, which, deepening 

every moment, soon swelled into a roar, and seemed to fill the air.  

No words or even voices could be distinguished in this clamour, nor 

did they speak much to each other; though such as were better 

informed upon the topic than the rest, would tell their neighbours, 

perhaps, that they might know the hangman when he came out, by his 

being the shorter one: and that the man who was to suffer with him 

was named Hugh: and that it was Barnaby Rudge who would be hanged 

in Bloomsbury Square.



The hum grew, as the time drew near, so loud, that those who were 

at the windows could not hear the church-clock strike, though it 

was close at hand.  Nor had they any need to hear it, either, for 

they could see it in the people's faces.  So surely as another 

quarter chimed, there was a movement in the crowd--as if something 

had passed over it--as if the light upon them had been changed--in 

which the fact was readable as on a brazen dial, figured by a 

giant's hand.



Three quarters past eleven!  The murmur now was deafening, yet 

every man seemed mute.  Look where you would among the crowd, you 

saw strained eyes and lips compressed; it would have been difficult 

for the most vigilant observer to point this way or that, and say 

that yonder man had cried out.  It were as easy to detect the 

motion of lips in a sea-shell.



Three quarters past eleven!  Many spectators who had retired from 

the windows, came back refreshed, as though their watch had just 

begun.  Those who had fallen asleep, roused themselves; and every 

person in the crowd made one last effort to better his position--

which caused a press against the sturdy barriers that made them 

bend and yield like twigs.  The officers, who until now had kept 

together, fell into their several positions, and gave the words of 

command.  Swords were drawn, muskets shouldered, and the bright 

steel winding its way among the crowd, gleamed and glittered in the 

sun like a river.  Along this shining path, two men came hurrying 

on, leading a horse, which was speedily harnessed to the cart at 

the prison-door.  Then, a profound silence replaced the tumult that 

had so long been gathering, and a breathless pause ensued.  Every 

window was now choked up with heads; the house-tops teemed with 

people--clinging to chimneys, peering over gable-ends, and holding 

on where the sudden loosening of any brick or stone would dash them 

down into the street.  The church tower, the church roof, the 

church yard, the prison leads, the very water-spouts and 

lampposts--every inch of room--swarmed with human life.



At the first stroke of twelve the prison-bell began to toll.  Then 

the roar--mingled now with cries of 'Hats off!' and 'Poor fellows!' 

and, from some specks in the great concourse, with a shriek or 

groan--burst forth again.  It was terrible to see--if any one in 

that distraction of excitement could have seen--the world of eager 

eyes, all strained upon the scaffold and the beam.



The hollow murmuring was heard within the jail as plainly as 

without.  The three were brought forth into the yard, together, as 

it resounded through the air.  They knew its import well.



'D'ye hear?' cried Hugh, undaunted by the sound.  'They expect us!  

I heard them gathering when I woke in the night, and turned over on 

t'other side and fell asleep again.  We shall see how they welcome 

the hangman, now that it comes home to him.  Ha, ha, ha!'



The Ordinary coming up at this moment, reproved him for his 

indecent mirth, and advised him to alter his demeanour.



'And why, master?' said Hugh.  'Can I do better than bear it 

easily?  YOU bear it easily enough.  Oh! never tell me,' he cried, 

as the other would have spoken, 'for all your sad look and your 


solemn air, you think little enough of it!  They say you're the 

best maker of lobster salads in London.  Ha, ha!  I've heard that, 

you see, before now.  Is it a good one, this morning--is your hand 

in?  How does the breakfast look?  I hope there's enough, and to 

spare, for all this hungry company that'll sit down to it, when the 

sight's over.'



'I fear,' observed the clergyman, shaking his head, 'that you are 

incorrigible.'



'You're right.  I am,' rejoined Hugh sternly.  'Be no hypocrite, 

master!  You make a merry-making of this, every month; let me be 

merry, too.  If you want a frightened fellow there's one that'll 

suit you.  Try your hand upon him.'



He pointed, as he spoke, to Dennis, who, with his legs trailing on 

the ground, was held between two men; and who trembled so, that all 

his joints and limbs seemed racked by spasms.  Turning from this 

wretched spectacle, he called to Barnaby, who stood apart.



'What cheer, Barnaby?  Don't be downcast, lad.  Leave that to HIM.'



'Bless you,' cried Barnaby, stepping lightly towards him, 'I'm not 

frightened, Hugh.  I'm quite happy.  I wouldn't desire to live now, 

if they'd let me.  Look at me!  Am I afraid to die?  Will they see 

ME tremble?'



Hugh gazed for a moment at his face, on which there was a strange, 

unearthly smile; and at his eye, which sparkled brightly; and 

interposing between him and the Ordinary, gruffly whispered to the 

latter:



'I wouldn't say much to him, master, if I was you.  He may spoil 

your appetite for breakfast, though you ARE used to it.'



He was the only one of the three who had washed or trimmed himself 

that morning.  Neither of the others had done so, since their doom 

was pronounced.  He still wore the broken peacock's feathers in his 

hat; and all his usual scraps of finery were carefully disposed 

about his person.  His kindling eye, his firm step, his proud and 

resolute bearing, might have graced some lofty act of heroism; some 

voluntary sacrifice, born of a noble cause and pure enthusiasm; 

rather than that felon's death.



But all these things increased his guilt.  They were mere 

assumptions.  The law had declared it so, and so it must be.  The 

good minister had been greatly shocked, not a quarter of an hour 

before, at his parting with Grip.  For one in his condition, to 

fondle a bird!--The yard was filled with people; bluff civic 

functionaries, officers of justice, soldiers, the curious in such 

matters, and guests who had been bidden as to a wedding.  Hugh 

looked about him, nodded gloomily to some person in authority, who 

indicated with his hand in what direction he was to proceed; and 

clapping Barnaby on the shoulder, passed out with the gait of a 

lion.



They entered a large room, so near to the scaffold that the voices 

of those who stood about it, could be plainly heard: some 

beseeching the javelin-men to take them out of the crowd: others 

crying to those behind, to stand back, for they were pressed to 

death, and suffocating for want of air.



In the middle of this chamber, two smiths, with hammers, stood 

beside an anvil.  Hugh walked straight up to them, and set his foot 

upon it with a sound as though it had been struck by a heavy 

weapon.  Then, with folded arms, he stood to have his irons knocked 

off: scowling haughtily round, as those who were present eyed him 

narrowly and whispered to each other.



It took so much time to drag Dennis in, that this ceremony was over 

with Hugh, and nearly over with Barnaby, before he appeared.  He no 

sooner came into the place he knew so well, however, and among 

faces with which he was so familiar, than he recovered strength and 

sense enough to clasp his hands and make a last appeal.



'Gentlemen, good gentlemen,' cried the abject creature, grovelling 

down upon his knees, and actually prostrating himself upon the 

stone floor: 'Governor, dear governor--honourable sheriffs--worthy 

gentlemen--have mercy upon a wretched man that has served His 

Majesty, and the Law, and Parliament, for so many years, and don't--

don't let me die--because of a mistake.'



'Dennis,' said the governor of the jail, 'you know what the course 

is, and that the order came with the rest.  You know that we could 

do nothing, even if we would.'



'All I ask, sir,--all I want and beg, is time, to make it sure,' 

cried the trembling wretch, looking wildly round for sympathy.  

'The King and Government can't know it's me; I'm sure they can't 

know it's me; or they never would bring me to this dreadful 

slaughterhouse.  They know my name, but they don't know it's the 

same man.  Stop my execution--for charity's sake stop my execution, 

gentlemen--till they can be told that I've been hangman here, nigh 

thirty year.  Will no one go and tell them?' he implored, clenching 

his hands and glaring round, and round, and round again--'will no 

charitable person go and tell them!'



'Mr Akerman,' said a gentleman who stood by, after a moment's 

pause, 'since it may possibly produce in this unhappy man a better 

frame of mind, even at this last minute, let me assure him that he 

was well known to have been the hangman, when his sentence was 

considered.'



'--But perhaps they think on that account that the punishment's not 

so great,' cried the criminal, shuffling towards this speaker on 

his knees, and holding up his folded hands; 'whereas it's worse, 

it's worse a hundred times, to me than any man.  Let them know 

that, sir.  Let them know that.  They've made it worse to me by 

giving me so much to do.  Stop my execution till they know that!'



The governor beckoned with his hand, and the two men, who had 

supported him before, approached.  He uttered a piercing cry:



'Wait!  Wait.  Only a moment--only one moment more!  Give me a last 

chance of reprieve.  One of us three is to go to Bloomsbury Square.  

Let me be the one.  It may come in that time; it's sure to come.  

In the Lord's name let me be sent to Bloomsbury Square.  Don't hang 

me here.  It's murder.'



They took him to the anvil: but even then he could he heard above 

the clinking of the smiths' hammers, and the hoarse raging of the 

crowd, crying that he knew of Hugh's birth--that his father was 

living, and was a gentleman of influence and rank--that he had 

family secrets in his possession--that he could tell nothing unless 

they gave him time, but must die with them on his mind; and he 

continued to rave in this sort until his voice failed him, and he 

sank down a mere heap of clothes between the two attendants.



It was at this moment that the clock struck the first stroke of 

twelve, and the bell began to toll.  The various officers, with the 

two sheriffs at their head, moved towards the door.  All was ready 

when the last chime came upon the ear.



They told Hugh this, and asked if he had anything to say.



'To say!' he cried.  'Not I.  I'm ready.--Yes,' he added, as his 

eye fell upon Barnaby, 'I have a word to say, too.  Come hither, 

lad.'



There was, for the moment, something kind, and even tender, 

struggling in his fierce aspect, as he wrung his poor companion by 

the hand.



'I'll say this,' he cried, looking firmly round, 'that if I had ten 

lives to lose, and the loss of each would give me ten times the 

agony of the hardest death, I'd lay them all down--ay, I would, 

though you gentlemen may not believe it--to save this one.  This 

one,' he added, wringing his hand again, 'that will be lost through 

me.'



'Not through you,' said the idiot, mildly.  'Don't say that.  You 

were not to blame.  You have always been very good to me.--Hugh, we 

shall know what makes the stars shine, NOW!'



'I took him from her in a reckless mood, and didn't think what harm 

would come of it,' said Hugh, laying his hand upon his head, and 

speaking in a lower voice.  'I ask her pardon; and his.--Look 

here,' he added roughly, in his former tone.  'You see this lad?'



They murmured 'Yes,' and seemed to wonder why he asked.



'That gentleman yonder--' pointing to the clergyman--'has often in 

the last few days spoken to me of faith, and strong belief.  You 

see what I am--more brute than man, as I have been often told--but 

I had faith enough to believe, and did believe as strongly as any 

of you gentlemen can believe anything, that this one life would be 

spared.  See what he is!--Look at him!'



Barnaby had moved towards the door, and stood beckoning him to 

follow.



'If this was not faith, and strong belief!' cried Hugh, raising 

his right arm aloft, and looking upward like a savage prophet whom 

the near approach of Death had filled with inspiration, 'where are 

they!  What else should teach me--me, born as I was born, and 

reared as I have been reared--to hope for any mercy in this 

hardened, cruel, unrelenting place!  Upon these human shambles, I, 

who never raised this hand in prayer till now, call down the wrath 

of God!  On that black tree, of which I am the ripened fruit, I do 

invoke the curse of all its victims, past, and present, and to 

come.  On the head of that man, who, in his conscience, owns me for 

his son, I leave the wish that he may never sicken on his bed of 

down, but die a violent death as I do now, and have the night-wind 

for his only mourner.  To this I say, Amen, amen!'



His arm fell downward by his side; he turned; and moved towards 

them with a steady step, the man he had been before.



'There is nothing more?' said the governor.



Hugh motioned Barnaby not to come near him (though without looking 

in the direction where he stood) and answered, 'There is nothing 

more.'



'Move forward!'



'--Unless,' said Hugh, glancing hurriedly back,--'unless any 

person here has a fancy for a dog; and not then, unless he means to 

use him well.  There's one, belongs to me, at the house I came 

from, and it wouldn't be easy to find a better.  He'll whine at 

first, but he'll soon get over that.--You wonder that I think about 

a dog just now, he added, with a kind of laugh.  'If any man 

deserved it of me half as well, I'd think of HIM.'



He spoke no more, but moved onward in his place, with a careless 

air, though listening at the same time to the Service for the Dead, 

with something between sullen attention, and quickened curiosity.  

As soon as he had passed the door, his miserable associate was 

carried out; and the crowd beheld the rest.



Barnaby would have mounted the steps at the same time--indeed he 

would have gone before them, but in both attempts he was 

restrained, as he was to undergo the sentence elsewhere.  In a few 

minutes the sheriffs reappeared, the same procession was again 

formed, and they passed through various rooms and passages to 

another door--that at which the cart was waiting.  He held down his 

head to avoid seeing what he knew his eyes must otherwise 

encounter, and took his seat sorrowfully,--and yet with something 

of a childish pride and pleasure,--in the vehicle.  The officers 

fell into their places at the sides, in front and in the rear; the 

sheriffs' carriages rolled on; a guard of soldiers surrounded the 

whole; and they moved slowly forward through the throng and 

pressure toward Lord Mansfield's ruined house.



It was a sad sight--all the show, and strength, and glitter, 

assembled round one helpless creature--and sadder yet to note, as 

he rode along, how his wandering thoughts found strange 

encouragement in the crowded windows and the concourse in the 

streets; and how, even then, he felt the influence of the bright 

sky, and looked up, smiling, into its deep unfathomable blue.  But 

there had been many such sights since the riots were over--some so 

moving in their nature, and so repulsive too, that they were far 

more calculated to awaken pity for the sufferers, than respect for 

that law whose strong arm seemed in more than one case to be as 

wantonly stretched forth now that all was safe, as it had been 

basely paralysed in time of danger.



Two cripples--both mere boys--one with a leg of wood, one who 

dragged his twisted limbs along by the help of a crutch, were 

hanged in this same Bloomsbury Square.  As the cart was about to 

glide from under them, it was observed that they stood with their 

faces from, not to, the house they had assisted to despoil; and 

their misery was protracted that this omission might be remedied.  

Another boy was hanged in Bow Street; other young lads in various 

quarters of the town.  Four wretched women, too, were put to 

death.  In a word, those who suffered as rioters were, for the most 

part, the weakest, meanest, and most miserable among them.  It was 

a most exquisite satire upon the false religious cry which had led 

to so much misery, that some of these people owned themselves to be 

Catholics, and begged to be attended by their own priests.



One young man was hanged in Bishopsgate Street, whose aged grey-

headed father waited for him at the gallows, kissed him at its foot 

when he arrived, and sat there, on the ground, till they took him 

down.  They would have given him the body of his child; but he had 

no hearse, no coffin, nothing to remove it in, being too poor--and 

walked meekly away beside the cart that took it back to prison, 

trying, as he went, to touch its lifeless hand.



But the crowd had forgotten these matters, or cared little about 

them if they lived in their memory: and while one great multitude 

fought and hustled to get near the gibbet before Newgate, for a 

parting look, another followed in the train of poor lost Barnaby, 

to swell the throng that waited for him on the spot.
