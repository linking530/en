Leaving the favoured, and well-received, and flattered of the 

world; him of the world most worldly, who never compromised himself 

by an ungentlemanly action, and never was guilty of a manly one; to 

lie smilingly asleep--for even sleep, working but little change in 

his dissembling face, became with him a piece of cold, conventional 

hypocrisy--we follow in the steps of two slow travellers on foot, 

making towards Chigwell.



Barnaby and his mother.  Grip in their company, of course.



The widow, to whom each painful mile seemed longer than the last, 

toiled wearily along; while Barnaby, yielding to every inconstant 

impulse, fluttered here and there, now leaving her far behind, now 

lingering far behind himself, now darting into some by-lane or path 

and leaving her to pursue her way alone, until he stealthily 

emerged again and came upon her with a wild shout of merriment, as 

his wayward and capricious nature prompted.  Now he would call to 

her from the topmost branch of some high tree by the roadside; now 

using his tall staff as a leaping-pole, come flying over ditch or 

hedge or five-barred gate; now run with surprising swiftness for a 

mile or more on the straight road, and halting, sport upon a patch 

of grass with Grip till she came up.  These were his delights; and 

when his patient mother heard his merry voice, or looked into his 

flushed and healthy face, she would not have abated them by one sad 

word or murmur, though each had been to her a source of suffering 

in the same degree as it was to him of pleasure.



It is something to look upon enjoyment, so that it be free and 

wild and in the face of nature, though it is but the enjoyment of 

an idiot.  It is something to know that Heaven has left the 

capacity of gladness in such a creature's breast; it is something 

to be assured that, however lightly men may crush that faculty in 

their fellows, the Great Creator of mankind imparts it even to his 

despised and slighted work.  Who would not rather see a poor idiot 

happy in the sunlight, than a wise man pining in a darkened jail!



Ye men of gloom and austerity, who paint the face of Infinite 

Benevolence with an eternal frown; read in the Everlasting Book, 

wide open to your view, the lesson it would teach.  Its pictures 

are not in black and sombre hues, but bright and glowing tints; its 

music--save when ye drown it--is not in sighs and groans, but songs 

and cheerful sounds.  Listen to the million voices in the summer 

air, and find one dismal as your own.  Remember, if ye can, the 

sense of hope and pleasure which every glad return of day awakens 

in the breast of all your kind who have not changed their nature; 

and learn some wisdom even from the witless, when their hearts are 

lifted up they know not why, by all the mirth and happiness it 

brings.



The widow's breast was full of care, was laden heavily with secret 

dread and sorrow; but her boy's gaiety of heart gladdened her, and 

beguiled the long journey.  Sometimes he would bid her lean upon 

his arm, and would keep beside her steadily for a short distance; 

but it was more his nature to be rambling to and fro, and she 

better liked to see him free and happy, even than to have him near 

her, because she loved him better than herself.



She had quitted the place to which they were travelling, directly 

after the event which had changed her whole existence; and for two-

and-twenty years had never had courage to revisit it.  It was her 

native village.  How many recollections crowded on her mind when it 

appeared in sight!



Two-and-twenty years.  Her boy's whole life and history.  The last 

time she looked back upon those roofs among the trees, she carried 

him in her arms, an infant.  How often since that time had she sat 

beside him night and day, watching for the dawn of mind that never 

came; how had she feared, and doubted, and yet hoped, long after 

conviction forced itself upon her!  The little stratagems she had 

devised to try him, the little tokens he had given in his childish 

way--not of dulness but of something infinitely worse, so ghastly 

and unchildlike in its cunning--came back as vividly as if but 

yesterday had intervened.  The room in which they used to be; the 

spot in which his cradle stood; he, old and elfin-like in face, but 

ever dear to her, gazing at her with a wild and vacant eye, and 

crooning some uncouth song as she sat by and rocked him; every 

circumstance of his infancy came thronging back, and the most 

trivial, perhaps, the most distinctly.



His older childhood, too; the strange imaginings he had; his terror 

of certain senseless things--familiar objects he endowed with life; 

the slow and gradual breaking out of that one horror, in which, 

before his birth, his darkened intellect began; how, in the midst 

of all, she had found some hope and comfort in his being unlike 

another child, and had gone on almost believing in the slow 

development of his mind until he grew a man, and then his childhood 

was complete and lasting; one after another, all these old thoughts 

sprung up within her, strong after their long slumber and bitterer 

than ever.



She took his arm and they hurried through the village street.  It 

was the same as it was wont to be in old times, yet different too, 

and wore another air.  The change was in herself, not it; but she 

never thought of that, and wondered at its alteration, and where it 

lay, and what it was.



The people all knew Barnaby, and the children of the place came 

flocking round him--as she remembered to have done with their 

fathers and mothers round some silly beggarman, when a child 

herself.  None of them knew her; they passed each well-remembered 

house, and yard, and homestead; and striking into the fields, were 

soon alone again.



The Warren was the end of their journey.  Mr Haredale was walking 

in the garden, and seeing them as they passed the iron gate, 

unlocked it, and bade them enter that way.



'At length you have mustered heart to visit the old place,' he said 

to the widow.  'I am glad you have.'



'For the first time, and the last, sir,' she replied.



'The first for many years, but not the last?'



'The very last.'



'You mean,' said Mr Haredale, regarding her with some surprise, 

'that having made this effort, you are resolved not to persevere 

and are determined to relapse?  This is unworthy of you.  I have 

often told you, you should return here.  You would be happier here 

than elsewhere, I know.  As to Barnaby, it's quite his home.'



'And Grip's,' said Barnaby, holding the basket open.  The raven 

hopped gravely out, and perching on his shoulder and addressing 

himself to Mr Haredale, cried--as a hint, perhaps, that some 

temperate refreshment would be acceptable--'Polly put the ket-tle 

on, we'll all have tea!'



'Hear me, Mary,' said Mr Haredale kindly, as he motioned her to 

walk with him towards the house.  'Your life has been an example of 

patience and fortitude, except in this one particular which has 

often given me great pain.  It is enough to know that you were 

cruelly involved in the calamity which deprived me of an only 

brother, and Emma of her father, without being obliged to suppose 

(as I sometimes am) that you associate us with the author of our 

joint misfortunes.'



'Associate you with him, sir!' she cried.



'Indeed,' said Mr Haredale, 'I think you do.  I almost believe 

that because your husband was bound by so many ties to our 

relation, and died in his service and defence, you have come in 

some sort to connect us with his murder.'



'Alas!' she answered.  'You little know my heart, sir.  You little 

know the truth!'



'It is natural you should do so; it is very probable you may, 

without being conscious of it,' said Mr Haredale, speaking more to 

himself than her.  'We are a fallen house.  Money, dispensed with 

the most lavish hand, would be a poor recompense for sufferings 

like yours; and thinly scattered by hands so pinched and tied as 

ours, it becomes a miserable mockery.  I feel it so, God knows,' he 

added, hastily.  'Why should I wonder if she does!'



'You do me wrong, dear sir, indeed,' she rejoined with great 

earnestness; 'and yet when you come to hear what I desire your 

leave to say--'



'I shall find my doubts confirmed?' he said, observing that she 

faltered and became confused.  'Well!'



He quickened his pace for a few steps, but fell back again to her 

side, and said:



'And have you come all this way at last, solely to speak to me?'



She answered, 'Yes.'



'A curse,' he muttered, 'upon the wretched state of us proud 

beggars, from whom the poor and rich are equally at a distance; the 

one being forced to treat us with a show of cold respect; the other 

condescending to us in their every deed and word, and keeping more 

aloof, the nearer they approach us.--Why, if it were pain to you 

(as it must have been) to break for this slight purpose the chain 

of habit forged through two-and-twenty years, could you not let me 

know your wish, and beg me to come to you?'



'There was not time, sir,' she rejoined.  'I took my resolution 

but last night, and taking it, felt that I must not lose a day--a 

day! an hour--in having speech with you.'



They had by this time reached the house.  Mr Haredale paused for a 

moment, and looked at her as if surprised by the energy of her 

manner.  Observing, however, that she took no heed of him, but 

glanced up, shuddering, at the old walls with which such horrors 

were connected in her mind, he led her by a private stair into his 

library, where Emma was seated in a window, reading.



The young lady, seeing who approached, hastily rose and laid aside 

her book, and with many kind words, and not without tears, gave her 

a warm and earnest welcome.  But the widow shrunk from her embrace 

as though she feared her, and sunk down trembling on a chair.



'It is the return to this place after so long an absence,' said 

Emma gently.  'Pray ring, dear uncle--or stay--Barnaby will run 

himself and ask for wine--'



'Not for the world,' she cried.  'It would have another taste--I 

could not touch it.  I want but a minute's rest.  Nothing but 

that.'



Miss Haredale stood beside her chair, regarding her with silent 

pity.  She remained for a little time quite still; then rose and 

turned to Mr Haredale, who had sat down in his easy chair, and was 

contemplating her with fixed attention.



The tale connected with the mansion borne in mind, it seemed, as 

has been already said, the chosen theatre for such a deed as it had 

known.  The room in which this group were now assembled--hard by 

the very chamber where the act was done--dull, dark, and sombre; 

heavy with worm-eaten books; deadened and shut in by faded 

hangings, muffling every sound; shadowed mournfully by trees whose 

rustling boughs gave ever and anon a spectral knocking at the 

glass; wore, beyond all others in the house, a ghostly, gloomy air.  

Nor were the group assembled there, unfitting tenants of the spot.  

The widow, with her marked and startling face and downcast eyes; Mr 

Haredale stern and despondent ever; his niece beside him, like, yet 

most unlike, the picture of her father, which gazed reproachfully 

down upon them from the blackened wall; Barnaby, with his vacant 

look and restless eye; were all in keeping with the place, and 

actors in the legend.  Nay, the very raven, who had hopped upon the 

table and with the air of some old necromancer appeared to be 

profoundly studying a great folio volume that lay open on a desk, 

was strictly in unison with the rest, and looked like the embodied 

spirit of evil biding his time of mischief.



'I scarcely know,' said the widow, breaking silence, 'how to begin.  

You will think my mind disordered.'



'The whole tenor of your quiet and reproachless life since you were 

last here,' returned Mr Haredale, mildly, 'shall bear witness for 

you.  Why do you fear to awaken such a suspicion?  You do not speak 

to strangers.  You have not to claim our interest or consideration 

for the first time.  Be more yourself.  Take heart.  Any advice or 

assistance that I can give you, you know is yours of right, and 

freely yours.'



'What if I came, sir,' she rejoined, 'I who have but one other 

friend on earth, to reject your aid from this moment, and to say 

that henceforth I launch myself upon the world, alone and 

unassisted, to sink or swim as Heaven may decree!'



'You would have, if you came to me for such a purpose,' said Mr 

Haredale calmly, 'some reason to assign for conduct so 

extraordinary, which--if one may entertain the possibility of 

anything so wild and strange--would have its weight, of course.'



'That, sir,' she answered, 'is the misery of my distress.  I can 

give no reason whatever.  My own bare word is all that I can offer.  

It is my duty, my imperative and bounden duty.  If I did not 

discharge it, I should be a base and guilty wretch.  Having said 

that, my lips are sealed, and I can say no more.'



As though she felt relieved at having said so much, and had nerved 

herself to the remainder of her task, she spoke from this time with 

a firmer voice and heightened courage.



'Heaven is my witness, as my own heart is--and yours, dear young 

lady, will speak for me, I know--that I have lived, since that time 

we all have bitter reason to remember, in unchanging devotion, and 

gratitude to this family.  Heaven is my witness that go where I 

may, I shall preserve those feelings unimpaired.  And it is my 

witness, too, that they alone impel me to the course I must take, 

and from which nothing now shall turn me, as I hope for mercy.'



'These are strange riddles,' said Mr Haredale.



'In this world, sir,' she replied, 'they may, perhaps, never be 

explained.  In another, the Truth will be discovered in its own 

good time.  And may that time,' she added in a low voice, 'be far 

distant!'



'Let me be sure,' said Mr Haredale, 'that I understand you, for I 

am doubtful of my own senses.  Do you mean that you are resolved 

voluntarily to deprive yourself of those means of support you have 

received from us so long--that you are determined to resign the 

annuity we settled on you twenty years ago--to leave house, and 

home, and goods, and begin life anew--and this, for some secret 

reason or monstrous fancy which is incapable of explanation, which 

only now exists, and has been dormant all this time?  In the name 

of God, under what delusion are you labouring?'



'As I am deeply thankful,' she made answer, 'for the kindness of 

those, alive and dead, who have owned this house; and as I would 

not have its roof fall down and crush me, or its very walls drip 

blood, my name being spoken in their hearing; I never will again 

subsist upon their bounty, or let it help me to subsistence.  You 

do not know,' she added, suddenly, 'to what uses it may be applied; 

into what hands it may pass.  I do, and I renounce it.'



'Surely,' said Mr Haredale, 'its uses rest with you.'



'They did.  They rest with me no longer.  It may be--it IS--devoted 

to purposes that mock the dead in their graves.  It never can 

prosper with me.  It will bring some other heavy judgement on the 

head of my dear son, whose innocence will suffer for his mother's 

guilt.'



'What words are these!' cried Mr Haredale, regarding her with 

wonder.  'Among what associates have you fallen?  Into what guilt 

have you ever been betrayed?'



'I am guilty, and yet innocent; wrong, yet right; good in 

intention, though constrained to shield and aid the bad.  Ask me no 

more questions, sir; but believe that I am rather to be pitied than 

condemned.  I must leave my house to-morrow, for while I stay 

there, it is haunted.  My future dwelling, if I am to live in 

peace, must be a secret.  If my poor boy should ever stray this 

way, do not tempt him to disclose it or have him watched when he 

returns; for if we are hunted, we must fly again.  And now this 

load is off my mind, I beseech you--and you, dear Miss Haredale, 

too--to trust me if you can, and think of me kindly as you have 

been used to do.  If I die and cannot tell my secret even then (for 

that may come to pass), it will sit the lighter on my breast in 

that hour for this day's work; and on that day, and every day until 

it comes, I will pray for and thank you both, and trouble you no 

more.



With that, she would have left them, but they detained her, and 

with many soothing words and kind entreaties, besought her to 

consider what she did, and above all to repose more freely upon 

them, and say what weighed so sorely on her mind.  Finding her deaf 

to their persuasions, Mr Haredale suggested, as a last resource, 

that she should confide in Emma, of whom, as a young person and one 

of her own sex, she might stand in less dread than of himself.  

From this proposal, however, she recoiled with the same 

indescribable repugnance she had manifested when they met.  The 

utmost that could be wrung from her was, a promise that she would 

receive Mr Haredale at her own house next evening, and in the mean 

time reconsider her determination and their dissuasions--though any 

change on her part, as she told them, was quite hopeless.  This 

condition made at last, they reluctantly suffered her to depart, 

since she would neither eat nor drink within the house; and she, 

and Barnaby, and Grip, accordingly went out as they had come, by 

the private stair and garden-gate; seeing and being seen of no one 

by the way.



It was remarkable in the raven that during the whole interview he 

had kept his eye on his book with exactly the air of a very sly 

human rascal, who, under the mask of pretending to read hard, was 

listening to everything.  He still appeared to have the 

conversation very strongly in his mind, for although, when they 

were alone again, he issued orders for the instant preparation of 

innumerable kettles for purposes of tea, he was thoughtful, and 

rather seemed to do so from an abstract sense of duty, than with 

any regard to making himself agreeable, or being what is commonly 

called good company.



They were to return by the coach.  As there was an interval of 

full two hours before it started, and they needed rest and some 

refreshment, Barnaby begged hard for a visit to the Maypole.  But 

his mother, who had no wish to be recognised by any of those who 

had known her long ago, and who feared besides that Mr Haredale 

might, on second thoughts, despatch some messenger to that place of 

entertainment in quest of her, proposed to wait in the churchyard 

instead.  As it was easy for Barnaby to buy and carry thither such 

humble viands as they required, he cheerfully assented, and in the 

churchyard they sat down to take their frugal dinner.



Here again, the raven was in a highly reflective state; walking up 

and down when he had dined, with an air of elderly complacency 

which was strongly suggestive of his having his hands under his 

coat-tails; and appearing to read the tombstones with a very 

critical taste.  Sometimes, after a long inspection of an epitaph, 

he would strop his beak upon the grave to which it referred, and 

cry in his hoarse tones, 'I'm a devil, I'm a devil, I'm a devil!' 

but whether he addressed his observations to any supposed person 

below, or merely threw them off as a general remark, is matter of 

uncertainty.



It was a quiet pretty spot, but a sad one for Barnaby's mother; for 

Mr Reuben Haredale lay there, and near the vault in which his ashes 

rested, was a stone to the memory of her own husband, with a brief 

inscription recording how and when he had lost his life.  She sat 

here, thoughtful and apart, until their time was out, and the 

distant horn told that the coach was coming.



Barnaby, who had been sleeping on the grass, sprung up quickly at 

the sound; and Grip, who appeared to understand it equally well, 

walked into his basket straightway, entreating society in general 

(as though he intended a kind of satire upon them in connection 

with churchyards) never to say die on any terms.  They were soon on 

the coach-top and rolling along the road.



It went round by the Maypole, and stopped at the door.  Joe was 

from home, and Hugh came sluggishly out to hand up the parcel that 

it called for.  There was no fear of old John coming out.  They 

could see him from the coach-roof fast asleep in his cosy bar.  It 

was a part of John's character.  He made a point of going to sleep 

at the coach's time.  He despised gadding about; he looked upon 

coaches as things that ought to be indicted; as disturbers of the 

peace of mankind; as restless, bustling, busy, horn-blowing 

contrivances, quite beneath the dignity of men, and only suited to 

giddy girls that did nothing but chatter and go a-shopping.  'We 

know nothing about coaches here, sir,' John would say, if any 

unlucky stranger made inquiry touching the offensive vehicles; 'we 

don't book for 'em; we'd rather not; they're more trouble than 

they're worth, with their noise and rattle.  If you like to wait 

for 'em you can; but we don't know anything about 'em; they may 

call and they may not--there's a carrier--he was looked upon as 

quite good enough for us, when I was a boy.'



She dropped her veil as Hugh climbed up, and while he hung behind, 

and talked to Barnaby in whispers.  But neither he nor any other 

person spoke to her, or noticed her, or had any curiosity about 

her; and so, an alien, she visited and left the village where she 

had been born, and had lived a merry child, a comely girl, a happy 

wife--where she had known all her enjoyment of life, and had 

entered on its hardest sorrows.
