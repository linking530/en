In the year 1775, there stood upon the borders of Epping Forest, 

at a distance of about twelve miles from London--measuring from the 

Standard in Cornhill,' or rather from the spot on or near to which 

the Standard used to be in days of yore--a house of public 

entertainment called the Maypole; which fact was demonstrated to 

all such travellers as could neither read nor write (and at that 

time a vast number both of travellers and stay-at-homes were in 

this condition) by the emblem reared on the roadside over against 

the house, which, if not of those goodly proportions that Maypoles 

were wont to present in olden times, was a fair young ash, thirty 

feet in height, and straight as any arrow that ever English yeoman 

drew.



The Maypole--by which term from henceforth is meant the house, and 

not its sign--the Maypole was an old building, with more gable ends 

than a lazy man would care to count on a sunny day; huge zig-zag 

chimneys, out of which it seemed as though even smoke could not 

choose but come in more than naturally fantastic shapes, imparted 

to it in its tortuous progress; and vast stables, gloomy, ruinous, 

and empty.  The place was said to have been built in the days of 

King Henry the Eighth; and there was a legend, not only that Queen 

Elizabeth had slept there one night while upon a hunting excursion, 

to wit, in a certain oak-panelled room with a deep bay window, but 

that next morning, while standing on a mounting block before the 

door with one foot in the stirrup, the virgin monarch had then and 

there boxed and cuffed an unlucky page for some neglect of duty.  

The matter-of-fact and doubtful folks, of whom there were a few 

among the Maypole customers, as unluckily there always are in every 

little community, were inclined to look upon this tradition as 

rather apocryphal; but, whenever the landlord of that ancient 

hostelry appealed to the mounting block itself as evidence, and 

triumphantly pointed out that there it stood in the same place to 

that very day, the doubters never failed to be put down by a large 

majority, and all true believers exulted as in a victory.



Whether these, and many other stories of the like nature, were true 

or untrue, the Maypole was really an old house, a very old house, 

perhaps as old as it claimed to be, and perhaps older, which will 

sometimes happen with houses of an uncertain, as with ladies of a 

certain, age.  Its windows were old diamond-pane lattices, its 

floors were sunken and uneven, its ceilings blackened by the hand 

of time, and heavy with massive beams.  Over the doorway was an 

ancient porch, quaintly and grotesquely carved; and here on summer 

evenings the more favoured customers smoked and drank--ay, and 

sang many a good song too, sometimes--reposing on two grim-looking 

high-backed settles, which, like the twin dragons of some fairy 

tale, guarded the entrance to the mansion.



In the chimneys of the disused rooms, swallows had built their 

nests for many a long year, and from earliest spring to latest 

autumn whole colonies of sparrows chirped and twittered in the 

eaves.  There were more pigeons about the dreary stable-yard and 

out-buildings than anybody but the landlord could reckon up.  The 

wheeling and circling flights of runts, fantails, tumblers, and 

pouters, were perhaps not quite consistent with the grave and sober 

character of the building, but the monotonous cooing, which never 

ceased to be raised by some among them all day long, suited it 

exactly, and seemed to lull it to rest.  With its overhanging 

stories, drowsy little panes of glass, and front bulging out and 

projecting over the pathway, the old house looked as if it were 

nodding in its sleep.  Indeed, it needed no very great stretch of 

fancy to detect in it other resemblances to humanity.  The bricks 

of which it was built had originally been a deep dark red, but had 

grown yellow and discoloured like an old man's skin; the sturdy 

timbers had decayed like teeth; and here and there the ivy, like a 

warm garment to comfort it in its age, wrapt its green leaves 

closely round the time-worn walls.



It was a hale and hearty age though, still: and in the summer or 

autumn evenings, when the glow of the setting sun fell upon the oak 

and chestnut trees of the adjacent forest, the old house, partaking 

of its lustre, seemed their fit companion, and to have many good 

years of life in him yet.



The evening with which we have to do, was neither a summer nor an 

autumn one, but the twilight of a day in March, when the wind 

howled dismally among the bare branches of the trees, and rumbling 

in the wide chimneys and driving the rain against the windows of 

the Maypole Inn, gave such of its frequenters as chanced to be 

there at the moment an undeniable reason for prolonging their stay, 

and caused the landlord to prophesy that the night would certainly 

clear at eleven o'clock precisely,--which by a remarkable 

coincidence was the hour at which he always closed his house.



The name of him upon whom the spirit of prophecy thus descended was 

John Willet, a burly, large-headed man with a fat face, which 

betokened profound obstinacy and slowness of apprehension, 

combined with a very strong reliance upon his own merits.  It was 

John Willet's ordinary boast in his more placid moods that if he 

were slow he was sure; which assertion could, in one sense at 

least, be by no means gainsaid, seeing that he was in everything 

unquestionably the reverse of fast, and withal one of the most 

dogged and positive fellows in existence--always sure that what he 

thought or said or did was right, and holding it as a thing quite 

settled and ordained by the laws of nature and Providence, that 

anybody who said or did or thought otherwise must be inevitably and 

of necessity wrong.



Mr Willet walked slowly up to the window, flattened his fat nose 

against the cold glass, and shading his eyes that his sight might 

not be affected by the ruddy glow of the fire, looked abroad.  Then 

he walked slowly back to his old seat in the chimney-corner, and, 

composing himself in it with a slight shiver, such as a man might 

give way to and so acquire an additional relish for the warm blaze, 

said, looking round upon his guests:



'It'll clear at eleven o'clock.  No sooner and no later.  Not 

before and not arterwards.'



'How do you make out that?' said a little man in the opposite 

corner.  'The moon is past the full, and she rises at nine.'



John looked sedately and solemnly at his questioner until he had 

brought his mind to bear upon the whole of his observation, and 

then made answer, in a tone which seemed to imply that the moon was 

peculiarly his business and nobody else's:



'Never you mind about the moon.  Don't you trouble yourself about 

her.  You let the moon alone, and I'll let you alone.'



'No offence I hope?' said the little man.



Again John waited leisurely until the observation had thoroughly 

penetrated to his brain, and then replying, 'No offence as YET,' 

applied a light to his pipe and smoked in placid silence; now and 

then casting a sidelong look at a man wrapped in a loose riding-

coat with huge cuffs ornamented with tarnished silver lace and 

large metal buttons, who sat apart from the regular frequenters of 

the house, and wearing a hat flapped over his face, which was still 

further shaded by the hand on which his forehead rested, looked 

unsociable enough.



There was another guest, who sat, booted and spurred, at some 

distance from the fire also, and whose thoughts--to judge from his 

folded arms and knitted brows, and from the untasted liquor before 

him--were occupied with other matters than the topics under 

discussion or the persons who discussed them.  This was a young man 

of about eight-and-twenty, rather above the middle height, and 

though of somewhat slight figure, gracefully and strongly made.  He 

wore his own dark hair, and was accoutred in a riding dress, which 

together with his large boots (resembling in shape and fashion 

those worn by our Life Guardsmen at the present day), showed 

indisputable traces of the bad condition of the roads.  But travel-

stained though he was, he was well and even richly attired, and 

without being overdressed looked a gallant gentleman.



Lying upon the table beside him, as he had carelessly thrown them 

down, were a heavy riding-whip and a slouched hat, the latter worn 

no doubt as being best suited to the inclemency of the weather.  

There, too, were a pair of pistols in a holster-case, and a short 

riding-cloak.  Little of his face was visible, except the long dark 

lashes which concealed his downcast eyes, but an air of careless 

ease and natural gracefulness of demeanour pervaded the figure, and 

seemed to comprehend even those slight accessories, which were all 

handsome, and in good keeping.



Towards this young gentleman the eyes of Mr Willet wandered but 

once, and then as if in mute inquiry whether he had observed his 

silent neighbour.  It was plain that John and the young gentleman 

had often met before.  Finding that his look was not returned, or 

indeed observed by the person to whom it was addressed, John 

gradually concentrated the whole power of his eyes into one focus, 

and brought it to bear upon the man in the flapped hat, at whom he 

came to stare in course of time with an intensity so remarkable, 

that it affected his fireside cronies, who all, as with one accord, 

took their pipes from their lips, and stared with open mouths at 

the stranger likewise.



The sturdy landlord had a large pair of dull fish-like eyes, and 

the little man who had hazarded the remark about the moon (and who 

was the parish-clerk and bell-ringer of Chigwell, a village hard 

by) had little round black shiny eyes like beads; moreover this 

little man wore at the knees of his rusty black breeches, and on 

his rusty black coat, and all down his long flapped waistcoat, 

little queer buttons like nothing except his eyes; but so like 

them, that as they twinkled and glistened in the light of the fire, 

which shone too in his bright shoe-buckles, he seemed all eyes from 

head to foot, and to be gazing with every one of them at the 

unknown customer.  No wonder that a man should grow restless under 

such an inspection as this, to say nothing of the eyes belonging to 

short Tom Cobb the general chandler and post-office keeper, and 

long Phil Parkes the ranger, both of whom, infected by the example 

of their companions, regarded him of the flapped hat no less 

attentively.



The stranger became restless; perhaps from being exposed to this 

raking fire of eyes, perhaps from the nature of his previous 

meditations--most probably from the latter cause, for as he changed 

his position and looked hastily round, he started to find himself 

the object of such keen regard, and darted an angry and suspicious 

glance at the fireside group.  It had the effect of immediately 

diverting all eyes to the chimney, except those of John Willet, who 

finding himself as it were, caught in the fact, and not being (as 

has been already observed) of a very ready nature, remained staring 

at his guest in a particularly awkward and disconcerted manner.



'Well?' said the stranger.



Well.  There was not much in well.  It was not a long speech.  'I 

thought you gave an order,' said the landlord, after a pause of two 

or three minutes for consideration.



The stranger took off his hat, and disclosed the hard features of a 

man of sixty or thereabouts, much weatherbeaten and worn by time, 

and the naturally harsh expression of which was not improved by a 

dark handkerchief which was bound tightly round his head, and, 

while it served the purpose of a wig, shaded his forehead, and 

almost hid his eyebrows.  If it were intended to conceal or divert 

attention from a deep gash, now healed into an ugly seam, which 

when it was first inflicted must have laid bare his cheekbone, the 

object was but indifferently attained, for it could scarcely fail 

to be noted at a glance.  His complexion was of a cadaverous hue, 

and he had a grizzly jagged beard of some three weeks' date.  Such 

was the figure (very meanly and poorly clad) that now rose from the 

seat, and stalking across the room sat down in a corner of the 

chimney, which the politeness or fears of the little clerk very 

readily assigned to him.



'A highwayman!' whispered Tom Cobb to Parkes the ranger.



'Do you suppose highwaymen don't dress handsomer than that?' 

replied Parkes.  'It's a better business than you think for, Tom, 

and highwaymen don't need or use to be shabby, take my word for it.'



Meanwhile the subject of their speculations had done due honour to 

the house by calling for some drink, which was promptly supplied by 

the landlord's son Joe, a broad-shouldered strapping young fellow 

of twenty, whom it pleased his father still to consider a little 

boy, and to treat accordingly.  Stretching out his hands to warm 

them by the blazing fire, the man turned his head towards the 

company, and after running his eye sharply over them, said in a 

voice well suited to his appearance:



'What house is that which stands a mile or so from here?'



'Public-house?' said the landlord, with his usual deliberation.



'Public-house, father!' exclaimed Joe, 'where's the public-house 

within a mile or so of the Maypole?  He means the great house--the 

Warren--naturally and of course.  The old red brick house, sir, 

that stands in its own grounds--?'



'Aye,' said the stranger.



'And that fifteen or twenty years ago stood in a park five times as 

broad, which with other and richer property has bit by bit changed 

hands and dwindled away--more's the pity!' pursued the young man.



'Maybe,' was the reply.  'But my question related to the owner.  

What it has been I don't care to know, and what it is I can see for 

myself.'



The heir-apparent to the Maypole pressed his finger on his lips, 

and glancing at the young gentleman already noticed, who had 

changed his attitude when the house was first mentioned, replied in 

a lower tone:



'The owner's name is Haredale, Mr Geoffrey Haredale, and'--again he 

glanced in the same direction as before--'and a worthy gentleman 

too--hem!'



Paying as little regard to this admonitory cough, as to the 

significant gesture that had preceded it, the stranger pursued his 

questioning.



'I turned out of my way coming here, and took the footpath that 

crosses the grounds.  Who was the young lady that I saw entering a 

carriage?  His daughter?'



'Why, how should I know, honest man?' replied Joe, contriving in 

the course of some arrangements about the hearth, to advance close 

to his questioner and pluck him by the sleeve, 'I didn't see the 

young lady, you know.  Whew!  There's the wind again--AND rain--

well it IS a night!'



Rough weather indeed!' observed the strange man.



'You're used to it?' said Joe, catching at anything which seemed to 

promise a diversion of the subject.



'Pretty well,' returned the other.  'About the young lady--has Mr 

Haredale a daughter?'



'No, no,' said the young fellow fretfully, 'he's a single 

gentleman--he's--be quiet, can't you, man?  Don't you see this 

talk is not relished yonder?'



Regardless of this whispered remonstrance, and affecting not to 

hear it, his tormentor provokingly continued:



'Single men have had daughters before now.  Perhaps she may be his 

daughter, though he is not married.'



'What do you mean?' said Joe, adding in an undertone as he 

approached him again, 'You'll come in for it presently, I know you 

will!'



'I mean no harm'--returned the traveller boldly, 'and have said 

none that I know of.  I ask a few questions--as any stranger may, 

and not unnaturally--about the inmates of a remarkable house in a 

neighbourhood which is new to me, and you are as aghast and 

disturbed as if I were talking treason against King George.  

Perhaps you can tell me why, sir, for (as I say) I am a stranger, 

and this is Greek to me?'



The latter observation was addressed to the obvious cause of Joe 

Willet's discomposure, who had risen and was adjusting his riding-

cloak preparatory to sallying abroad.  Briefly replying that he 

could give him no information, the young man beckoned to Joe, and 

handing him a piece of money in payment of his reckoning, hurried 

out attended by young Willet himself, who taking up a candle 

followed to light him to the house-door.



While Joe was absent on this errand, the elder Willet and his three 

companions continued to smoke with profound gravity, and in a deep 

silence, each having his eyes fixed on a huge copper boiler that 

was suspended over the fire.  After some time John Willet slowly 

shook his head, and thereupon his friends slowly shook theirs; but 

no man withdrew his eyes from the boiler, or altered the solemn 

expression of his countenance in the slightest degree.



At length Joe returned--very talkative and conciliatory, as though 

with a strong presentiment that he was going to be found fault 

with.



'Such a thing as love is!' he said, drawing a chair near the fire, 

and looking round for sympathy.  'He has set off to walk to 

London,--all the way to London.  His nag gone lame in riding out 

here this blessed afternoon, and comfortably littered down in our 

stable at this minute; and he giving up a good hot supper and our 

best bed, because Miss Haredale has gone to a masquerade up in 

town, and he has set his heart upon seeing her!  I don't think I 

could persuade myself to do that, beautiful as she is,--but then 

I'm not in love (at least I don't think I am) and that's the whole 

difference.'



'He is in love then?' said the stranger.



'Rather,' replied Joe.  'He'll never be more in love, and may very 

easily be less.'



'Silence, sir!' cried his father.



'What a chap you are, Joe!' said Long Parkes.



'Such a inconsiderate lad!' murmured Tom Cobb.



'Putting himself forward and wringing the very nose off his own 

father's face!' exclaimed the parish-clerk, metaphorically.



'What HAVE I done?' reasoned poor Joe.



'Silence, sir!' returned his father, 'what do you mean by talking, 

when you see people that are more than two or three times your age, 

sitting still and silent and not dreaming of saying a word?'



'Why that's the proper time for me to talk, isn't it?' said Joe 

rebelliously.



'The proper time, sir!' retorted his father, 'the proper time's no 

time.'



'Ah to be sure!' muttered Parkes, nodding gravely to the other two 

who nodded likewise, observing under their breaths that that was 

the point.



'The proper time's no time, sir,' repeated John Willet; 'when I was 

your age I never talked, I never wanted to talk.  I listened and 

improved myself that's what I did.'



'And you'd find your father rather a tough customer in argeyment, 

Joe, if anybody was to try and tackle him,' said Parkes.



'For the matter o' that, Phil!' observed Mr Willet, blowing a long, 

thin, spiral cloud of smoke out of the corner of his mouth, and 

staring at it abstractedly as it floated away; 'For the matter o' 

that, Phil, argeyment is a gift of Natur.  If Natur has gifted a 

man with powers of argeyment, a man has a right to make the best of 

'em, and has not a right to stand on false delicacy, and deny that 

he is so gifted; for that is a turning of his back on Natur, a 

flouting of her, a slighting of her precious caskets, and a proving 

of one's self to be a swine that isn't worth her scattering pearls 

before.'



The landlord pausing here for a very long time, Mr Parkes naturally 

concluded that he had brought his discourse to an end; and 

therefore, turning to the young man with some austerity, 

exclaimed:



'You hear what your father says, Joe?  You wouldn't much like to 

tackle him in argeyment, I'm thinking, sir.'



'IF,' said John Willet, turning his eyes from the ceiling to the 

face of his interrupter, and uttering the monosyllable in capitals, 

to apprise him that he had put in his oar, as the vulgar say, with 

unbecoming and irreverent haste; 'IF, sir, Natur has fixed upon me 

the gift of argeyment, why should I not own to it, and rather glory 

in the same?  Yes, sir, I AM a tough customer that way.  You are 

right, sir.  My toughness has been proved, sir, in this room many 

and many a time, as I think you know; and if you don't know,' added 

John, putting his pipe in his mouth again, 'so much the better, for 

I an't proud and am not going to tell you.'



A general murmur from his three cronies, and a general shaking of 

heads at the copper boiler, assured John Willet that they had had 

good experience of his powers and needed no further evidence to 

assure them of his superiority.  John smoked with a little more 

dignity and surveyed them in silence.



'It's all very fine talking,' muttered Joe, who had been fidgeting 

in his chair with divers uneasy gestures.  'But if you mean to tell 

me that I'm never to open my lips--'



'Silence, sir!' roared his father.  'No, you never are.  When your 

opinion's wanted, you give it.  When you're spoke to, you speak.  

When your opinion's not wanted and you're not spoke to, don't you 

give an opinion and don't you speak.  The world's undergone a nice 

alteration since my time, certainly.  My belief is that there an't 

any boys left--that there isn't such a thing as a boy--that there's 

nothing now between a male baby and a man--and that all the boys 

went out with his blessed Majesty King George the Second.'



'That's a very true observation, always excepting the young 

princes,' said the parish-clerk, who, as the representative of 

church and state in that company, held himself bound to the nicest 

loyalty.  'If it's godly and righteous for boys, being of the ages 

of boys, to behave themselves like boys, then the young princes 

must be boys and cannot be otherwise.'



'Did you ever hear tell of mermaids, sir?' said Mr Willet.



'Certainly I have,' replied the clerk.



'Very good,' said Mr Willet.  'According to the constitution of 

mermaids, so much of a mermaid as is not a woman must be a fish.  

According to the constitution of young princes, so much of a young 

prince (if anything) as is not actually an angel, must be godly and 

righteous.  Therefore if it's becoming and godly and righteous in 

the young princes (as it is at their ages) that they should be 

boys, they are and must be boys, and cannot by possibility be 

anything else.'



This elucidation of a knotty point being received with such marks 

of approval as to put John Willet into a good humour, he contented 

himself with repeating to his son his command of silence, and 

addressing the stranger, said:



'If you had asked your questions of a grown-up person--of me or any 

of these gentlemen--you'd have had some satisfaction, and wouldn't 

have wasted breath.  Miss Haredale is Mr Geoffrey Haredale's 

niece.'



'Is her father alive?' said the man, carelessly.



'No,' rejoined the landlord, 'he is not alive, and he is not dead--'



'Not dead!' cried the other.



'Not dead in a common sort of way,' said the landlord.



The cronies nodded to each other, and Mr Parkes remarked in an 

undertone, shaking his head meanwhile as who should say, 'let no 

man contradict me, for I won't believe him,' that John Willet was 

in amazing force to-night, and fit to tackle a Chief Justice.



The stranger suffered a short pause to elapse, and then asked 

abruptly, 'What do you mean?'



'More than you think for, friend,' returned John Willet.  'Perhaps 

there's more meaning in them words than you suspect.'



'Perhaps there is,' said the strange man, gruffly; 'but what the 

devil do you speak in such mysteries for?  You tell me, first, that 

a man is not alive, nor yet dead--then, that he's not dead in a 

common sort of way--then, that you mean a great deal more than I 

think for.  To tell you the truth, you may do that easily; for so 

far as I can make out, you mean nothing.  What DO you mean, I ask 

again?'



'That,' returned the landlord, a little brought down from his 

dignity by the stranger's surliness, 'is a Maypole story, and has 

been any time these four-and-twenty years.  That story is Solomon 

Daisy's story.  It belongs to the house; and nobody but Solomon 

Daisy has ever told it under this roof, or ever shall--that's 

more.'



The man glanced at the parish-clerk, whose air of consciousness 

and importance plainly betokened him to be the person referred to, 

and, observing that he had taken his pipe from his lips, after a 

very long whiff to keep it alight, and was evidently about to tell 

his story without further solicitation, gathered his large coat 

about him, and shrinking further back was almost lost in the gloom 

of the spacious chimney-corner, except when the flame, struggling 

from under a great faggot, whose weight almost crushed it for the 

time, shot upward with a strong and sudden glare, and illumining 

his figure for a moment, seemed afterwards to cast it into deeper 

obscurity than before.



By this flickering light, which made the old room, with its heavy 

timbers and panelled walls, look as if it were built of polished 

ebony--the wind roaring and howling without, now rattling the latch 

and creaking the hinges of the stout oaken door, and now driving at 

the casement as though it would beat it in--by this light, and 

under circumstances so auspicious, Solomon Daisy began his tale:



'It was Mr Reuben Haredale, Mr Geoffrey's elder brother--'



Here he came to a dead stop, and made so long a pause that even 

John Willet grew impatient and asked why he did not proceed.



'Cobb,' said Solomon Daisy, dropping his voice and appealing to the 

post-office keeper; 'what day of the month is this?'



'The nineteenth.'



'Of March,' said the clerk, bending forward, 'the nineteenth of 

March; that's very strange.'



In a low voice they all acquiesced, and Solomon went on:



'It was Mr Reuben Haredale, Mr Geoffrey's elder brother, that 

twenty-two years ago was the owner of the Warren, which, as Joe 

has said--not that you remember it, Joe, for a boy like you can't 

do that, but because you have often heard me say so--was then a 

much larger and better place, and a much more valuable property 

than it is now.  His lady was lately dead, and he was left with one 

child--the Miss Haredale you have been inquiring about--who was 

then scarcely a year old.'



Although the speaker addressed himself to the man who had shown so 

much curiosity about this same family, and made a pause here as if 

expecting some exclamation of surprise or encouragement, the latter 

made no remark, nor gave any indication that he heard or was 

interested in what was said.  Solomon therefore turned to his old 

companions, whose noses were brightly illuminated by the deep red 

glow from the bowls of their pipes; assured, by long experience, of 

their attention, and resolved to show his sense of such indecent 

behaviour.



'Mr Haredale,' said Solomon, turning his back upon the strange man, 

'left this place when his lady died, feeling it lonely like, and 

went up to London, where he stopped some months; but finding that 

place as lonely as this--as I suppose and have always heard say--he 

suddenly came back again with his little girl to the Warren, 

bringing with him besides, that day, only two women servants, and 

his steward, and a gardener.'



Mr Daisy stopped to take a whiff at his pipe, which was going out, 

and then proceeded--at first in a snuffling tone, occasioned by 

keen enjoyment of the tobacco and strong pulling at the pipe, and 

afterwards with increasing distinctness:



'--Bringing with him two women servants, and his steward, and a 

gardener.  The rest stopped behind up in London, and were to follow 

next day.  It happened that that night, an old gentleman who lived 

at Chigwell Row, and had long been poorly, deceased, and an order 

came to me at half after twelve o'clock at night to go and toll the 

passing-bell.'



There was a movement in the little group of listeners, sufficiently 

indicative of the strong repugnance any one of them would have felt 

to have turned out at such a time upon such an errand.  The clerk 

felt and understood it, and pursued his theme accordingly.



'It WAS a dreary thing, especially as the grave-digger was laid up 

in his bed, from long working in a damp soil and sitting down to 

take his dinner on cold tombstones, and I was consequently under 

obligation to go alone, for it was too late to hope to get any 

other companion.  However, I wasn't unprepared for it; as the old 

gentleman had often made it a request that the bell should be 

tolled as soon as possible after the breath was out of his body, 

and he had been expected to go for some days.  I put as good a face 

upon it as I could, and muffling myself up (for it was mortal 

cold), started out with a lighted lantern in one hand and the key 

of the church in the other.'



At this point of the narrative, the dress of the strange man 

rustled as if he had turned himself to hear more distinctly.  

Slightly pointing over his shoulder, Solomon elevated his eyebrows 

and nodded a silent inquiry to Joe whether this was the case.  Joe 

shaded his eyes with his hand and peered into the corner, but could 

make out nothing, and so shook his head.



'It was just such a night as this; blowing a hurricane, raining 

heavily, and very dark--I often think now, darker than I ever saw 

it before or since; that may be my fancy, but the houses were all 

close shut and the folks in doors, and perhaps there is only one 

other man who knows how dark it really was.  I got into the church, 

chained the door back so that it should keep ajar--for, to tell the 

truth, I didn't like to be shut in there alone--and putting my 

lantern on the stone seat in the little corner where the bell-rope 

is, sat down beside it to trim the candle.



'I sat down to trim the candle, and when I had done so I could not 

persuade myself to get up again, and go about my work.  I don't 

know how it was, but I thought of all the ghost stories I had ever 

heard, even those that I had heard when I was a boy at school, and 

had forgotten long ago; and they didn't come into my mind one after 

another, but all crowding at once, like.  I recollected one story 

there was in the village, how that on a certain night in the year 

(it might be that very night for anything I knew), all the dead 

people came out of the ground and sat at the heads of their own 

graves till morning.  This made me think how many people I had 

known, were buried between the church-door and the churchyard gate, 

and what a dreadful thing it would be to have to pass among them 

and know them again, so earthy and unlike themselves.  I had known 

all the niches and arches in the church from a child; still, I 

couldn't persuade myself that those were their natural shadows 

which I saw on the pavement, but felt sure there were some ugly 

figures hiding among 'em and peeping out.  Thinking on in this 

way, I began to think of the old gentleman who was just dead, and I 

could have sworn, as I looked up the dark chancel, that I saw him 

in his usual place, wrapping his shroud about him and shivering as 

if he felt it cold.  All this time I sat listening and listening, 

and hardly dared to breathe.  At length I started up and took the 

bell-rope in my hands.  At that minute there rang--not that bell, 

for I had hardly touched the rope--but another!



'I heard the ringing of another bell, and a deep bell too, plainly.  

It was only for an instant, and even then the wind carried the 

sound away, but I heard it.  I listened for a long time, but it 

rang no more.  I had heard of corpse candles, and at last I 

persuaded myself that this must be a corpse bell tolling of itself 

at midnight for the dead.  I tolled my bell--how, or how long, I 

don't know--and ran home to bed as fast as I could touch the 

ground.



'I was up early next morning after a restless night, and told the 

story to my neighbours.  Some were serious and some made light of 

it; I don't think anybody believed it real.  But, that morning, Mr 

Reuben Haredale was found murdered in his bedchamber; and in his 

hand was a piece of the cord attached to an alarm-bell outside the 

roof, which hung in his room and had been cut asunder, no doubt by 

the murderer, when he seized it.



'That was the bell I heard.



'A bureau was found opened, and a cash-box, which Mr Haredale had 

brought down that day, and was supposed to contain a large sum of 

money, was gone.  The steward and gardener were both missing and 

both suspected for a long time, but they were never found, though 

hunted far and wide.  And far enough they might have looked for 

poor Mr Rudge the steward, whose body--scarcely to be recognised by 

his clothes and the watch and ring he wore--was found, months 

afterwards, at the bottom of a piece of water in the grounds, with 

a deep gash in the breast where he had been stabbed with a knife.  

He was only partly dressed; and people all agreed that he had been 

sitting up reading in his own room, where there were many traces of 

blood, and was suddenly fallen upon and killed before his master.



Everybody now knew that the gardener must be the murderer, and 

though he has never been heard of from that day to this, he will 

be, mark my words.  The crime was committed this day two-and-twenty 

years--on the nineteenth of March, one thousand seven hundred and 

fifty-three.  On the nineteenth of March in some year--no matter 

when--I know it, I am sure of it, for we have always, in some 

strange way or other, been brought back to the subject on that day 

ever since--on the nineteenth of March in some year, sooner or 

later, that man will be discovered.'
