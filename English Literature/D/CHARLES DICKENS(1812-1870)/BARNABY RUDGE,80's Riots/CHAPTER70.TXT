Mr Dennis having despatched this piece of business without any 

personal hurt or inconvenience, and having now retired into the 

tranquil respectability of private life, resolved to solace himself 

with half an hour or so of female society.  With this amiable 

purpose in his mind, he bent his steps towards the house where 

Dolly and Miss Haredale were still confined, and whither Miss Miggs 

had also been removed by order of Mr Simon Tappertit.



As he walked along the streets with his leather gloves clasped 

behind him, and his face indicative of cheerful thought and 

pleasant calculation, Mr Dennis might have been likened unto a 

farmer ruminating among his crops, and enjoying by anticipation the 

bountiful gifts of Providence.  Look where he would, some heap of 

ruins afforded him rich promise of a working off; the whole town 

appeared to have been ploughed and sown, and nurtured by most 

genial weather; and a goodly harvest was at hand.



Having taken up arms and resorted to deeds of violence, with the 

great main object of preserving the Old Bailey in all its purity, 

and the gallows in all its pristine usefulness and moral grandeur, 

it would perhaps be going too far to assert that Mr Dennis had ever 

distinctly contemplated and foreseen this happy state of things.  

He rather looked upon it as one of those beautiful dispensations 

which are inscrutably brought about for the behoof and advantage of 

good men.  He felt, as it were, personally referred to, in this 

prosperous ripening for the gibbet; and had never considered 

himself so much the pet and favourite child of Destiny, or loved 

that lady so well or with such a calm and virtuous reliance, in 

all his life.



As to being taken up, himself, for a rioter, and punished with the 

rest, Mr Dennis dismissed that possibility from his thoughts as an 

idle chimera; arguing that the line of conduct he had adopted at 

Newgate, and the service he had rendered that day, would be more 

than a set-off against any evidence which might identify him as a 

member of the crowd.  That any charge of companionship which might 

be made against him by those who were themselves in danger, would 

certainly go for nought.  And that if any trivial indiscretion on 

his part should unluckily come out, the uncommon usefulness of his 

office, at present, and the great demand for the exercise of its 

functions, would certainly cause it to be winked at, and passed 

over.  In a word, he had played his cards throughout, with great 

care; had changed sides at the very nick of time; had delivered up 

two of the most notorious rioters, and a distinguished felon to 

boot; and was quite at his ease.



Saving--for there is a reservation; and even Mr Dennis was not 

perfectly happy--saving for one circumstance; to wit, the forcible 

detention of Dolly and Miss Haredale, in a house almost adjoining 

his own.  This was a stumbling-block; for if they were discovered 

and released, they could, by the testimony they had it in their 

power to give, place him in a situation of great jeopardy; and to 

set them at liberty, first extorting from them an oath of secrecy 

and silence, was a thing not to be thought of.  It was more, 

perhaps, with an eye to the danger which lurked in this quarter, 

than from his abstract love of conversation with the sex, that the 

hangman, quickening his steps, now hastened into their society, 

cursing the amorous natures of Hugh and Mr Tappertit with great 

heartiness, at every step he took.



When be entered the miserable room in which they were confined, 

Dolly and Miss Haredale withdrew in silence to the remotest corner.  

But Miss Miggs, who was particularly tender of her reputation, 

immediately fell upon her knees and began to scream very loud, 

crying, 'What will become of me!'--'Where is my Simmuns!'--'Have 

mercy, good gentlemen, on my sex's weaknesses!'--with other doleful 

lamentations of that nature, which she delivered with great 

propriety and decorum.



'Miss, miss,' whispered Dennis, beckoning to her with his 

forefinger, 'come here--I won't hurt you.  Come here, my lamb, will 

you?'



On hearing this tender epithet, Miss Miggs, who had left off 

screaming when he opened his lips, and had listened to him 

attentively, began again, crying: 'Oh I'm his lamb!  He says I'm 

his lamb!  Oh gracious, why wasn't I born old and ugly!  Why was I 

ever made to be the youngest of six, and all of 'em dead and in 

their blessed graves, excepting one married sister, which is 

settled in Golden Lion Court, number twenty-sivin, second bell-

handle on the--!'



'Don't I say I an't a-going to hurt you?' said Dennis, pointing to 

a chair.  'Why miss, what's the matter?'



'I don't know what mayn't be the matter!' cried Miss Miggs, 

clasping her hands distractedly.  'Anything may be the matter!'



'But nothing is, I tell you,' said the hangman.  'First stop that 

noise and come and sit down here, will you, chuckey?'



The coaxing tone in which he said these latter words might have 

failed in its object, if he had not accompanied them with sundry 

sharp jerks of his thumb over one shoulder, and with divers winks 

and thrustings of his tongue into his cheek, from which signals the 

damsel gathered that he sought to speak to her apart, concerning 

Miss Haredale and Dolly.  Her curiosity being very powerful, and 

her jealousy by no means inactive, she arose, and with a great deal 

of shivering and starting back, and much muscular action among all 

the small bones in her throat, gradually approached him.



'Sit down,' said the hangman.



Suiting the action to the word, he thrust her rather suddenly and 

prematurely into a chair, and designing to reassure her by a little 

harmless jocularity, such as is adapted to please and fascinate 

the sex, converted his right forefinger into an ideal bradawl or 

gimlet, and made as though he would screw the same into her side--

whereat Miss Miggs shrieked again, and evinced symptoms of 

faintness.



'Lovey, my dear,' whispered Dennis, drawing his chair close to 

hers.  'When was your young man here last, eh?'



'MY young man, good gentleman!' answered Miggs in a tone of 

exquisite distress.



'Ah!  Simmuns, you know--him?' said Dennis.



'Mine indeed!' cried Miggs, with a burst of bitterness--and as she 

said it, she glanced towards Dolly.  'MINE, good gentleman!'



This was just what Mr Dennis wanted, and expected.



'Ah!' he said, looking so soothingly, not to say amorously on 

Miggs, that she sat, as she afterwards remarked, on pins and 

needles of the sharpest Whitechapel kind, not knowing what 

intentions might be suggesting that expression to his features: 

'I was afraid of that.  I saw as much myself.  It's her fault.  She 

WILL entice 'em.'



'I wouldn't,' cried Miggs, folding her hands and looking upwards 

with a kind of devout blankness, 'I wouldn't lay myself out as she 

does; I wouldn't be as bold as her; I wouldn't seem to say to all 

male creeturs "Come and kiss me"'--and here a shudder quite 

convulsed her frame--'for any earthly crowns as might be offered.  

Worlds,' Miggs added solemnly, 'should not reduce me.  No.  Not if 

I was Wenis.'



'Well, but you ARE Wenus, you know,' said Mr Dennis, 

confidentially.



'No, I am not, good gentleman,' answered Miggs, shaking her head 

with an air of self-denial which seemed to imply that she might be 

if she chose, but she hoped she knew better.  'No, I am not, good 

gentleman.  Don't charge me with it.'



Up to this time she had turned round, every now and then, to where 

Dolly and Miss Haredale had retired and uttered a scream, or groan, 

or laid her hand upon her heart and trembled excessively, with a 

view of keeping up appearances, and giving them to understand that 

she conversed with the visitor, under protest and on compulsion, 

and at a great personal sacrifice, for their common good.  But at 

this point, Mr Dennis looked so very full of meaning, and gave such 

a singularly expressive twitch to his face as a request to her to 

come still nearer to him, that she abandoned these little arts, and 

gave him her whole and undivided attention.



'When was Simmuns here, I say?' quoth Dennis, in her ear.



'Not since yesterday morning; and then only for a few minutes.  Not 

all day, the day before.'



'You know he meant all along to carry off that one!' said Dennis, 

indicating Dolly by the slightest possible jerk of his head:--'And 

to hand you over to somebody else.'



Miss Miggs, who had fallen into a terrible state of grief when the 

first part of this sentence was spoken, recovered a little at the 

second, and seemed by the sudden check she put upon her tears, to 

intimate that possibly this arrangement might meet her views; and 

that it might, perhaps, remain an open question.



'--But unfort'nately,' pursued Dennis, who observed this: 'somebody 

else was fond of her too, you see; and even if he wasn't, somebody 

else is took for a rioter, and it's all over with him.'



Miss Miggs relapsed.



'Now I want,' said Dennis, 'to clear this house, and to see you 

righted.  What if I was to get her off, out of the way, eh?'



Miss Miggs, brightening again, rejoined, with many breaks and 

pauses from excess of feeling, that temptations had been Simmuns's 

bane.  That it was not his faults, but hers (meaning Dolly's).  

That men did not see through these dreadful arts as women did, and 

therefore was caged and trapped, as Simmun had been.  That she had 

no personal motives to serve--far from it--on the contrary, her 

intentions was good towards all parties.  But forasmuch as she 

knowed that Simmun, if united to any designing and artful minxes 

(she would name no names, for that was not her dispositions)--to 

ANY designing and artful minxes--must be made miserable and unhappy 

for life, she DID incline towards prewentions.  Such, she added, 

was her free confessions.  But as this was private feelings, and 

might perhaps be looked upon as wengeance, she begged the gentleman 

would say no more.  Whatever he said, wishing to do her duty by all 

mankind, even by them as had ever been her bitterest enemies, she 

would not listen to him.  With that she stopped her ears, and shook 

her head from side to side, to intimate to Mr Dennis that though he 

talked until he had no breath left, she was as deaf as any adder.



'Lookee here, my sugar-stick,' said Mr Dennis, 'if your view's the 

same as mine, and you'll only be quiet and slip away at the right 

time, I can have the house clear to-morrow, and be out of this 

trouble.--Stop though! there's the other.'



'Which other, sir?' asked Miggs--still with her fingers in her ears 

and her head shaking obstinately.



'Why, the tallest one, yonder,' said Dennis, as he stroked his 

chin, and added, in an undertone to himself, something about not 

crossing Muster Gashford.



Miss Miggs replied (still being profoundly deaf) that if Miss 

Haredale stood in the way at all, he might make himself quite easy 

on that score; as she had gathered, from what passed between Hugh 

and Mr Tappertit when they were last there, that she was to be 

removed alone (not by them, but by somebody else), to-morrow night.



Mr Dennis opened his eyes very wide at this piece of information, 

whistled once, considered once, and finally slapped his head once 

and nodded once, as if he had got the clue to this mysterious 

removal, and so dismissed it.  Then he imparted his design 

concerning Dolly to Miss Miggs, who was taken more deaf than 

before, when he began; and so remained, all through.



The notable scheme was this.  Mr Dennis was immediately to seek out 

from among the rioters, some daring young fellow (and he had one in 

his eye, he said), who, terrified by the threats he could hold out 

to him, and alarmed by the capture of so many who were no better 

and no worse than he, would gladly avail himself of any help to get 

abroad, and out of harm's way, with his plunder, even though his 

journey were incumbered by an unwilling companion; indeed, the 

unwilling companion being a beautiful girl, would probably be an 

additional inducement and temptation.  Such a person found, he 

proposed to bring him there on the ensuing night, when the tall one 

was taken off, and Miss Miggs had purposely retired; and then that 

Dolly should be gagged, muffled in a cloak, and carried in any 

handy conveyance down to the river's side; where there were 

abundant means of getting her smuggled snugly off in any small 

craft of doubtful character, and no questions asked.  With regard 

to the expense of this removal, he would say, at a rough 

calculation, that two or three silver tea or coffee-pots, with 

something additional for drink (such as a muffineer, or toast-

rack), would more than cover it.  Articles of plate of every kind 

having been buried by the rioters in several lonely parts of 

London, and particularly, as he knew, in St James's Square, which, 

though easy of access, was little frequented after dark, and had a 

convenient piece of water in the midst, the needful funds were 

close at hand, and could be had upon the shortest notice.  With 

regard to Dolly, the gentleman would exercise his own discretion.  

He would be bound to do nothing but to take her away, and keep her 

away.  All other arrangements and dispositions would rest entirely 

with himself.



If Miss Miggs had had her hearing, no doubt she would have been 

greatly shocked by the indelicacy of a young female's going away 

with a stranger by night (for her moral feelings, as we have said, 

were of the tenderest kind); but directly Mr Dennis ceased to 

speak, she reminded him that he had only wasted breath.  She then 

went on to say (still with her fingers in her ears) that nothing 

less than a severe practical lesson would save the locksmith's 

daughter from utter ruin; and that she felt it, as it were, a moral 

obligation and a sacred duty to the family, to wish that some one 

would devise one for her reformation.  Miss Miggs remarked, and 

very justly, as an abstract sentiment which happened to occur to 

her at the moment, that she dared to say the locksmith and his wife 

would murmur, and repine, if they were ever, by forcible abduction, 

or otherwise, to lose their child; but that we seldom knew, in this 

world, what was best for us: such being our sinful and imperfect 

natures, that very few arrived at that clear understanding.



Having brought their conversation to this satisfactory end, they 

parted: Dennis, to pursue his design, and take another walk about 

his farm; Miss Miggs, to launch, when he left her, into such a 

burst of mental anguish (which she gave them to understand was 

occasioned by certain tender things he had had the presumption and 

audacity to say), that little Dolly's heart was quite melted.  

Indeed, she said and did so much to soothe the outraged feelings of 

Miss Miggs, and looked so beautiful while doing so, that if that 

young maid had not had ample vent for her surpassing spite, in a 

knowledge of the mischief that was brewing, she must have scratched 

her features, on the spot.
