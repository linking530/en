Beyond all measure astonished by the strange occurrences which had 

passed with so much violence and rapidity, the locksmith gazed upon 

the shuddering figure in the chair like one half stupefied, and 

would have gazed much longer, had not his tongue been loosened by 

compassion and humanity.



'You are ill,' said Gabriel.  'Let me call some neighbour in.'



'Not for the world,' she rejoined, motioning to him with her 

trembling hand, and holding her face averted.  'It is enough that 

you have been by, to see this.'



'Nay, more than enough--or less,' said Gabriel.



'Be it so,' she returned.  'As you like.  Ask me no questions, I 

entreat you.'



'Neighbour,' said the locksmith, after a pause.  'Is this fair, or 

reasonable, or just to yourself?  Is it like you, who have known me 

so long and sought my advice in all matters--like you, who from a 

girl have had a strong mind and a staunch heart?'



'I have need of them,' she replied.  'I am growing old, both in 

years and care.  Perhaps that, and too much trial, have made them 

weaker than they used to be.  Do not speak to me.'



'How can I see what I have seen, and hold my peace!' returned the 

locksmith.  'Who was that man, and why has his coming made this 

change in you?'



She was silent, but held to the chair as though to save herself 

from falling on the ground.



'I take the licence of an old acquaintance, Mary,' said the 

locksmith, 'who has ever had a warm regard for you, and maybe has 

tried to prove it when he could.  Who is this ill-favoured man, and 

what has he to do with you?  Who is this ghost, that is only seen 

in the black nights and bad weather?  How does he know, and why 

does he haunt, this house, whispering through chinks and crevices, 

as if there was that between him and you, which neither durst so 

much as speak aloud of?  Who is he?'



'You do well to say he haunts this house,' returned the widow, 

faintly.  'His shadow has been upon it and me, in light and 

darkness, at noonday and midnight.  And now, at last, he has come 

in the body!'



'But he wouldn't have gone in the body,' returned the locksmith 

with some irritation, 'if you had left my arms and legs at liberty.  

What riddle is this?'



'It is one,' she answered, rising as she spoke, 'that must remain 

for ever as it is.  I dare not say more than that.'



'Dare not!' repeated the wondering locksmith.



'Do not press me,' she replied.  'I am sick and faint, and every 

faculty of life seems dead within me.--No!--Do not touch me, 

either.'



Gabriel, who had stepped forward to render her assistance, fell 

back as she made this hasty exclamation, and regarded her in silent 

wonder.



'Let me go my way alone,' she said in a low voice, 'and let the 

hands of no honest man touch mine to-night.'  When she had 

tottered to the door, she turned, and added with a stronger effort, 

'This is a secret, which, of necessity, I trust to you.  You are a 

true man.  As you have ever been good and kind to me,--keep it.  If 

any noise was heard above, make some excuse--say anything but what 

you really saw, and never let a word or look between us, recall 

this circumstance.  I trust to you.  Mind, I trust to you.  How 

much I trust, you never can conceive.'



Casting her eyes upon him for an instant, she withdrew, and left 

him there alone.



Gabriel, not knowing what to think, stood staring at the door with 

a countenance full of surprise and dismay.  The more he pondered on 

what had passed, the less able he was to give it any favourable 

interpretation.  To find this widow woman, whose life for so many 

years had been supposed to be one of solitude and retirement, and 

who, in her quiet suffering character, had gained the good opinion 

and respect of all who knew her--to find her linked mysteriously 

with an ill-omened man, alarmed at his appearance, and yet 

favouring his escape, was a discovery that pained as much as 

startled him.  Her reliance on his secrecy, and his tacit 

acquiescence, increased his distress of mind.  If he had spoken 

boldly, persisted in questioning her, detained her when she rose to 

leave the room, made any kind of protest, instead of silently 

compromising himself, as he felt he had done, he would have been 

more at ease.



'Why did I let her say it was a secret, and she trusted it to me!' 

said Gabriel, putting his wig on one side to scratch his head with 

greater ease, and looking ruefully at the fire.  'I have no more 

readiness than old John himself.  Why didn't I say firmly, "You 

have no right to such secrets, and I demand of you to tell me what 

this means," instead of standing gaping at her, like an old moon-

calf as I am!  But there's my weakness.  I can be obstinate enough 

with men if need be, but women may twist me round their fingers at 

their pleasure.'



He took his wig off outright as he made this reflection, and, 

warming his handkerchief at the fire began to rub and polish his 

bald head with it, until it glistened again.



'And yet,' said the locksmith, softening under this soothing 

process, and stopping to smile, 'it MAY be nothing.  Any drunken 

brawler trying to make his way into the house, would have alarmed a 

quiet soul like her.  But then'--and here was the vexation--'how 

came it to be that man; how comes he to have this influence over 

her; how came she to favour his getting away from me; and, more 

than all, how came she not to say it was a sudden fright, and 

nothing more?  It's a sad thing to have, in one minute, reason to 

mistrust a person I have known so long, and an old sweetheart into 

the bargain; but what else can I do, with all this upon my mind!--

Is that Barnaby outside there?'



'Ay!' he cried, looking in and nodding.  'Sure enough it's 

Barnaby--how did you guess?'



'By your shadow,' said the locksmith.



'Oho!' cried Barnaby, glancing over his shoulder, 'He's a merry 

fellow, that shadow, and keeps close to me, though I AM silly.  We 

have such pranks, such walks, such runs, such gambols on the grass!  

Sometimes he'll be half as tall as a church steeple, and sometimes 

no bigger than a dwarf.  Now, he goes on before, and now behind, 

and anon he'll be stealing on, on this side, or on that, stopping 

whenever I stop, and thinking I can't see him, though I have my eye 

on him sharp enough.  Oh! he's a merry fellow.  Tell me--is he 

silly too?  I think he is.'



'Why?' asked Gabriel.



'Because be never tires of mocking me, but does it all day long.--

Why don't you come?'



'Where?'



'Upstairs.  He wants you.  Stay--where's HIS shadow?  Come.  You're 

a wise man; tell me that.'



'Beside him, Barnaby; beside him, I suppose,' returned the locksmith.



'No!' he replied, shaking his head.  'Guess again.'



'Gone out a walking, maybe?'



'He has changed shadows with a woman,' the idiot whispered in his 

ear, and then fell back with a look of triumph.  'Her shadow's 

always with him, and his with her.  That's sport I think, eh?'



'Barnaby,' said the locksmith, with a grave look; 'come hither, 

lad.'



'I know what you want to say.  I know!' he replied, keeping away 

from him.  'But I'm cunning, I'm silent.  I only say so much to 

you--are you ready?'  As he spoke, he caught up the light, and 

waved it with a wild laugh above his head.



'Softly--gently,' said the locksmith, exerting all his influence to 

keep him calm and quiet.  'I thought you had been asleep.'



'So I HAVE been asleep,' he rejoined, with widely-opened eyes.  

'There have been great faces coming and going--close to my face, 

and then a mile away--low places to creep through, whether I would 

or no--high churches to fall down from--strange creatures crowded 

up together neck and heels, to sit upon the bed--that's sleep, eh?'



'Dreams, Barnaby, dreams,' said the locksmith.



'Dreams!' he echoed softly, drawing closer to him.  'Those are not 

dreams.'



'What are,' replied the locksmith, 'if they are not?'



'I dreamed,' said Barnaby, passing his arm through Varden's, and 

peering close into his face as he answered in a whisper, 'I dreamed 

just now that something--it was in the shape of a man--followed me--

came softly after me--wouldn't let me be--but was always hiding 

and crouching, like a cat in dark corners, waiting till I should 

pass; when it crept out and came softly after me.--Did you ever see 

me run?'



'Many a time, you know.'



'You never saw me run as I did in this dream.  Still it came 

creeping on to worry me.  Nearer, nearer, nearer--I ran faster--

leaped--sprung out of bed, and to the window--and there, in the 

street below--but he is waiting for us.  Are you coming?'



'What in the street below, Barnaby?' said Varden, imagining that he 

traced some connection between this vision and what had actually 

occurred.



Barnaby looked into his face, muttered incoherently, waved the 

light above his head again, laughed, and drawing the locksmith's 

arm more tightly through his own, led him up the stairs in silence.



They entered a homely bedchamber, garnished in a scanty way with 

chairs, whose spindle-shanks bespoke their age, and other furniture 

of very little worth; but clean and neatly kept.  Reclining in an 

easy-chair before the fire, pale and weak from waste of blood, was 

Edward Chester, the young gentleman who had been the first to quit 

the Maypole on the previous night, and who, extending his hand to 

the locksmith, welcomed him as his preserver and friend.



'Say no more, sir, say no more,' said Gabriel.  'I hope I would 

have done at least as much for any man in such a strait, and most 

of all for you, sir.  A certain young lady,' he added, with some 

hesitation, 'has done us many a kind turn, and we naturally feel--I 

hope I give you no offence in saying this, sir?'



The young man smiled and shook his head; at the same time moving in 

his chair as if in pain.



'It's no great matter,' he said, in answer to the locksmith's 

sympathising look, 'a mere uneasiness arising at least as much from 

being cooped up here, as from the slight wound I have, or from the 

loss of blood.  Be seated, Mr Varden.'



'If I may make so bold, Mr Edward, as to lean upon your chair,' 

returned the locksmith, accommodating his action to his speech, and 

bending over him, 'I'll stand here for the convenience of speaking 

low.  Barnaby is not in his quietest humour to-night, and at such 

times talking never does him good.'



They both glanced at the subject of this remark, who had taken a 

seat on the other side of the fire, and, smiling vacantly, was 

making puzzles on his fingers with a skein of string.



'Pray, tell me, sir,' said Varden, dropping his voice still lower, 

'exactly what happened last night.  I have my reason for inquiring.  

You left the Maypole, alone?'



'And walked homeward alone, until I had nearly reached the place 

where you found me, when I heard the gallop of a horse.'



'Behind you?' said the locksmith.



'Indeed, yes--behind me.  It was a single rider, who soon overtook 

me, and checking his horse, inquired the way to London.'



'You were on the alert, sir, knowing how many highwaymen there are, 

scouring the roads in all directions?' said Varden.



'I was, but I had only a stick, having imprudently left my pistols 

in their holster-case with the landlord's son.  I directed him as 

he desired.  Before the words had passed my lips, he rode upon me 

furiously, as if bent on trampling me down beneath his horse's 

hoofs.  In starting aside, I slipped and fell.  You found me with 

this stab and an ugly bruise or two, and without my purse--in which 

he found little enough for his pains.  And now, Mr Varden,' he 

added, shaking the locksmith by the hand, 'saving the extent of my 

gratitude to you, you know as much as I.'



'Except,' said Gabriel, bending down yet more, and looking 

cautiously towards their silent neighhour, 'except in respect of 

the robber himself.  What like was he, sir?  Speak low, if you 

please.  Barnaby means no harm, but I have watched him oftener than 

you, and I know, little as you would think it, that he's listening 

now.'



It required a strong confidence in the locksmith's veracity to 

lead any one to this belief, for every sense and faculty that 

Barnahy possessed, seemed to be fixed upon his game, to the 

exclusion of all other things.  Something in the young man's face 

expressed this opinion, for Gabriel repeated what he had just said, 

more earnestly than before, and with another glance towards 

Barnaby, again asked what like the man was.



'The night was so dark,' said Edward, 'the attack so sudden, and 

he so wrapped and muffled up, that I can hardly say.  It seems 

that--'



'Don't mention his name, sir,' returned the locksmith, following 

his look towards Barnaby; 'I know HE saw him.  I want to know what 

YOU saw.'



'All I remember is,' said Edward, 'that as he checked his horse his 

hat was blown off.  He caught it, and replaced it on his head, 

which I observed was bound with a dark handkerchief.  A stranger 

entered the Maypole while I was there, whom I had not seen--for I 

had sat apart for reasons of my own--and when I rose to leave the 

room and glanced round, he was in the shadow of the chimney and 

hidden from my sight.  But, if he and the robber were two different 

persons, their voices were strangely and most remarkably alike; for 

directly the man addressed me in the road, I recognised his speech 

again.'



'It is as I feared.  The very man was here to-night,' thought the 

locksmith, changing colour.  'What dark history is this!'



'Halloa!' cried a hoarse voice in his ear.  'Halloa, halloa, 

halloa!  Bow wow wow.  What's the matter here!  Hal-loa!'



The speaker--who made the locksmith start as if he had been some 

supernatural agent--was a large raven, who had perched upon the top 

of the easy-chair, unseen by him and Edward, and listened with a 

polite attention and a most extraordinary appearance of 

comprehending every word, to all they had said up to this point; 

turning his head from one to the other, as if his office were to 

judge between them, and it were of the very last importance that he 

should not lose a word.



'Look at him!' said Varden, divided between admiration of the bird 

and a kind of fear of him.  'Was there ever such a knowing imp as 

that!  Oh he's a dreadful fellow!'



The raven, with his head very much on one side, and his bright eye 

shining like a diamond, preserved a thoughtful silence for a few 

seconds, and then replied in a voice so hoarse and distant, that it 

seemed to come through his thick feathers rather than out of his 

mouth.



'Halloa, halloa, halloa!  What's the matter here!  Keep up your 

spirits.  Never say die.  Bow wow wow.  I'm a devil, I'm a devil, 

I'm a devil.  Hurrah!'--And then, as if exulting in his infernal 

character, he began to whistle.



'I more than half believe he speaks the truth.  Upon my word I do,' 

said Varden.  'Do you see how he looks at me, as if he knew what I 

was saying?'



To which the bird, balancing himself on tiptoe, as it were, and 

moving his body up and down in a sort of grave dance, rejoined, 

'I'm a devil, I'm a devil, I'm a devil,' and flapped his wings 

against his sides as if he were bursting with laughter.  Barnaby 

clapped his hands, and fairly rolled upon the ground in an ecstasy 

of delight.



'Strange companions, sir,' said the locksmith, shaking his head, 

and looking from one to the other.  'The bird has all the wit.'



'Strange indeed!' said Edward, holding out his forefinger to the 

raven, who, in acknowledgment of the attention, made a dive at it 

immediately with his iron bill.  'Is he old?'



'A mere boy, sir,' replied the locksmith.  'A hundred and twenty, 

or thereabouts.  Call him down, Barnaby, my man.'



'Call him!' echoed Barnaby, sitting upright upon the floor, and 

staring vacantly at Gabriel, as he thrust his hair back from his 

face.  'But who can make him come!  He calls me, and makes me go 

where he will.  He goes on before, and I follow.  He's the master, 

and I'm the man.  Is that the truth, Grip?'



The raven gave a short, comfortable, confidential kind of croak;--a 

most expressive croak, which seemed to say, 'You needn't let these 

fellows into our secrets.  We understand each other.  It's all 

right.'



'I make HIM come?' cried Barnaby, pointing to the bird.  'Him, who 

never goes to sleep, or so much as winks!--Why, any time of night, 

you may see his eyes in my dark room, shining like two sparks.  And 

every night, and all night too, he's broad awake, talking to 

himself, thinking what he shall do to-morrow, where we shall go, 

and what he shall steal, and hide, and bury.  I make HIM come!  

Ha ha ha!'



On second thoughts, the bird appeared disposed to come of himself.  

After a short survey of the ground, and a few sidelong looks at the 

ceiling and at everybody present in turn, he fluttered to the 

floor, and went to Barnaby--not in a hop, or walk, or run, but in a 

pace like that of a very particular gentleman with exceedingly 

tight boots on, trying to walk fast over loose pebbles.  Then, 

stepping into his extended hand, and condescending to be held out 

at arm's length, he gave vent to a succession of sounds, not unlike 

the drawing of some eight or ten dozen of long corks, and again 

asserted his brimstone birth and parentage with great distinctness.



The locksmith shook his head--perhaps in some doubt of the 

creature's being really nothing but a bird--perhaps in pity for 

Bamaby, who by this time had him in his arms, and was rolling 

about, with him, on the ground.  As he raised his eyes from the 

poor fellow he encountered those of his mother, who had entered the 

room, and was looking on in silence.



She was quite white in the face, even to her lips, but had wholly 

subdued her emotion, and wore her usual quiet look.  Varden fancied 

as he glanced at her that she shrunk from his eye; and that she 

busied herself about the wounded gentleman to avoid him the better.



It was time he went to bed, she said.  He was to be removed to his 

own home on the morrow, and he had already exceeded his time for 

sitting up, by a full hour.  Acting on this hint, the locksmith 

prepared to take his leave.



'By the bye,' said Edward, as he shook him by the hand, and looked 

from him to Mrs Rudge and back again, 'what noise was that below?  

I heard your voice in the midst of it, and should have inquired 

before, but our other conversation drove it from my memory.  What 

was it?'



The locksmith looked towards her, and bit his lip.  She leant 

against the chair, and bent her eyes upon the ground.  Barnaby too--

he was listening.



--'Some mad or drunken fellow, sir,' Varden at length made answer, 

looking steadily at the widow as he spoke.  'He mistook the house, 

and tried to force an entrance.'



She breathed more freely, but stood quite motionless.  As the 

locksmith said 'Good night,' and Barnaby caught up the candle to 

light him down the stairs, she took it from him, and charged him--

with more haste and earnestness than so slight an occasion appeared 

to warrant--not to stir.  The raven followed them to satisfy 

himself that all was right below, and when they reached the street-

door, stood on the bottom stair drawing corks out of number.



With a trembling hand she unfastened the chain and bolts, and 

turned the key.  As she had her hand upon the latch, the locksmith 

said in a low voice,



'I have told a lie to-night, for your sake, Mary, and for the sake 

of bygone times and old acquaintance, when I would scorn to do so 

for my own.  I hope I may have done no harm, or led to none.  I 

can't help the suspicions you have forced upon me, and I am loth, I 

tell you plainly, to leave Mr Edward here.  Take care he comes to 

no hurt.  I doubt the safety of this roof, and am glad he leaves it 

so soon.  Now, let me go.'



For a moment she hid her face in her hands and wept; but resisting 

the strong impulse which evidently moved her to reply, opened the 

door--no wider than was sufficient for the passage of his body--

and motioned him away.  As the locksmith stood upon the step, it 

was chained and locked behind him, and the raven, in furtherance of 

these precautions, barked like a lusty house-dog.



'In league with that ill-looking figure that might have fallen from 

a gibbet--he listening and hiding here--Barnaby first upon the spot 

last night--can she who has always borne so fair a name be guilty 

of such crimes in secret!' said the locksmith, musing.  'Heaven 

forgive me if I am wrong, and send me just thoughts; but she is 

poor, the temptation may be great, and we daily hear of things as 

strange.--Ay, bark away, my friend.  If there's any wickedness 

going on, that raven's in it, I'll be sworn.'
