It is necessary at this juncture to return to Hugh, who, having, as 

we have seen, called to the rioters to disperse from about the 

Warren, and meet again as usual, glided back into the darkness from 

which he had emerged, and reappeared no more that night.



He paused in the copse which sheltered him from the observation of 

his mad companions, and waited to ascertain whether they drew off 

at his bidding, or still lingered and called to him to join them.  

Some few, he saw, were indisposed to go away without him, and made 

towards the spot where he stood concealed as though they were about 

to follow in his footsteps, and urge him to come back; but these 

men, being in their turn called to by their friends, and in truth 

not greatly caring to venture into the dark parts of the grounds, 

where they might be easily surprised and taken, if any of the 

neighbours or retainers of the family were watching them from among 

the trees, soon abandoned the idea, and hastily assembling such men 

as they found of their mind at the moment, straggled off.



When he was satisfied that the great mass of the insurgents were 

imitating this example, and that the ground was rapidly clearing, 

he plunged into the thickest portion of the little wood; and, 

crashing the branches as he went, made straight towards a distant 

light: guided by that, and by the sullen glow of the fire behind 

him.



As he drew nearer and nearer to the twinkling beacon towards which 

he bent his course, the red glare of a few torches began to reveal 

itself, and the voices of men speaking together in a subdued tone 

broke the silence which, save for a distant shouting now and then, 

already prevailed.  At length he cleared the wood, and, springing 

across a ditch, stood in a dark lane, where a small body of ill-

looking vagabonds, whom he had left there some twenty minutes 

before, waited his coming with impatience.



They were gathered round an old post-chaise or chariot, driven by 

one of themselves, who sat postilion-wise upon the near horse.  The 

blinds were drawn up, and Mr Tappertit and Dennis kept guard at the 

two windows.  The former assumed the command of the party, for he 

challenged Hugh as he advanced towards them; and when he did so, 

those who were resting on the ground about the carriage rose to 

their feet and clustered round him.



'Well!' said Simon, in a low voice; 'is all right?'



'Right enough,' replied Hugh, in the same tone.  'They're 

dispersing now--had begun before I came away.'



'And is the coast clear?'



'Clear enough before our men, I take it,' said Hugh.  'There are 

not many who, knowing of their work over yonder, will want to 

meddle with 'em to-night.--Who's got some drink here?'



Everybody had some plunder from the cellar; half-a-dozen flasks and 

bottles were offered directly.  He selected the largest, and 

putting it to his mouth, sent the wine gurgling down his throat.  

Having emptied it, he threw it down, and stretched out his hand for 

another, which he emptied likewise, at a draught.  Another was 

given him, and this he half emptied too.  Reserving what remained 

to finish with, he asked:



'Have you got anything to eat, any of you?  I'm as ravenous as a 

hungry wolf.  Which of you was in the larder--come?'



'I was, brother,' said Dennis, pulling off his hat, and fumbling in 

the crown.  'There's a matter of cold venison pasty somewhere or 

another here, if that'll do.'



'Do!' cried Hugh, seating himself on the pathway.  'Bring it out! 

Quick!  Show a light here, and gather round!  Let me sup in state, 

my lads!  Ha ha ha!'



Entering into his boisterous humour, for they all had drunk deeply, 

and were as wild as he, they crowded about him, while two of their 

number who had torches, held them up, one on either side of him, 

that his banquet might not be despatched in the dark.  Mr Dennis, 

having by this time succeeded in extricating from his hat a great 

mass of pasty, which had been wedged in so tightly that it was not 

easily got out, put it before him; and Hugh, having borrowed a 

notched and jagged knife from one of the company, fell to work upon 

it vigorously.



'I should recommend you to swallow a little fire every day, about 

an hour afore dinner, brother,' said Dennis, after a pause.  'It 

seems to agree with you, and to stimulate your appetite.'



Hugh looked at him, and at the blackened faces by which he was 

surrounded, and, stopping for a moment to flourish his knife above 

his head, answered with a roar of laughter.



'Keep order, there, will you?' said Simon Tappertit.



'Why, isn't a man allowed to regale himself, noble captain,' 

retorted his lieutenant, parting the men who stood between them, 

with his knife, that he might see him,--'to regale himself a little 

bit after such work as mine?  What a hard captain!  What a strict 

captain!  What a tyrannical captain!  Ha ha ha!'



'I wish one of you fellers would hold a bottle to his mouth to keep 

him quiet,' said Simon, 'unless you want the military to be down 

upon us.'



'And what if they are down upon us!' retorted Hugh.  'Who cares?  

Who's afraid?  Let 'em come, I say, let 'em come.  The more, the 

merrier.  Give me bold Barnaby at my side, and we two will settle 

the military, without troubling any of you.  Barnaby's the man for 

the military.  Barnaby's health!'



But as the majority of those present were by no means anxious for 

a second engagement that night, being already weary and exhausted, 

they sided with Mr Tappertit, and pressed him to make haste with 

his supper, for they had already delayed too long.  Knowing, even 

in the height of his frenzy, that they incurred great danger by 

lingering so near the scene of the late outrages, Hugh made an end 

of his meal without more remonstrance, and rising, stepped up to Mr 

Tappertit, and smote him on the back.



'Now then,' he cried, 'I'm ready.  There are brave birds inside 

this cage, eh?  Delicate birds,--tender, loving, little doves.  I 

caged 'em--I caged 'em--one more peep!'



He thrust the little man aside as he spoke, and mounting on the 

steps, which were half let down, pulled down the blind by force, 

and stared into the chaise like an ogre into his larder.



'Ha ha ha! and did you scratch, and pinch, and struggle, pretty 

mistress?' he cried, as he grasped a little hand that sought in 

vain to free itself from his grip: 'you, so bright-eyed, and 

cherry-lipped, and daintily made?  But I love you better for it, 

mistress.  Ay, I do.  You should stab me and welcome, so that it 

pleased you, and you had to cure me afterwards.  I love to see you 

proud and scornful.  It makes you handsomer than ever; and who so 

handsome as you at any time, my pretty one!'



'Come!' said Mr Tappertit, who had waited during this speech with 

considerable impatience.  'There's enough of that.  Come down.'



The little hand seconded this admonition by thrusting Hugh's great 

head away with all its force, and drawing up the blind, amidst his 

noisy laughter, and vows that he must have another look, for the 

last glimpse of that sweet face had provoked him past all bearing.  

However, as the suppressed impatience of the party now broke out 

into open murmurs, he abandoned this design, and taking his seat 

upon the bar, contented himself with tapping at the front windows 

of the carriage, and trying to steal a glance inside; Mr Tappertit, 

mounting the steps and hanging on by the door, issued his 

directions to the driver with a commanding voice and attitude; the 

rest got up behind, or ran by the side of the carriage, as they 

could; some, in imitation of Hugh, endeavoured to see the face he 

had praised so highly, and were reminded of their impertinence by 

hints from the cudgel of Mr Tappertit.  Thus they pursued their 

journey by circuitous and winding roads; preserving, except when 

they halted to take breath, or to quarrel about the best way of 

reaching London, pretty good order and tolerable silence.



In the mean time, Dolly--beautiful, bewitching, captivating little 

Dolly--her hair dishevelled, her dress torn, her dark eyelashes wet 

with tears, her bosom heaving--her face, now pale with fear, now 

crimsoned with indignation--her whole self a hundred times more 

beautiful in this heightened aspect than ever she had been before--

vainly strove to comfort Emma Haredale, and to impart to her the 

consolation of which she stood in so much need herself.  The 

soldiers were sure to come; they must be rescued; it would be 

impossible to convey them through the streets of London when they 

set the threats of their guards at defiance, and shrieked to the 

passengers for help.  If they did this when they came into the more 

frequented ways, she was certain--she was quite certain--they must 

be released.  So poor Dolly said, and so poor Dolly tried to think; 

but the invariable conclusion of all such arguments was, that Dolly 

burst into tears; cried, as she wrung her hands, what would they do 

or think, or who would comfort them, at home, at the Golden Key; 

and sobbed most piteously.



Miss Haredale, whose feelings were usually of a quieter kind than 

Dolly's, and not so much upon the surface, was dreadfully 

alarmed, and indeed had only just recovered from a swoon.  She was 

very pale, and the hand which Dolly held was quite cold; but she 

bade her, nevertheless, remember that, under Providence, much must 

depend upon their own discretion; that if they remained quiet and 

lulled the vigilance of the ruffians into whose hands they had 

fallen, the chances of their being able to procure assistance when 

they reached the town, were very much increased; that unless 

society were quite unhinged, a hot pursuit must be immediately 

commenced; and that her uncle, she might be sure, would never rest 

until he had found them out and rescued them.  But as she said 

these latter words, the idea that he had fallen in a general 

massacre of the Catholics that night--no very wild or improbable 

supposition after what they had seen and undergone--struck her 

dumb; and, lost in the horrors they had witnessed, and those they 

might be yet reserved for, she sat incapable of thought, or speech, 

or outward show of grief: as rigid, and almost as white and cold, 

as marble.



Oh, how many, many times, in that long ride, did Dolly think of her 

old lover,--poor, fond, slighted Joe!  How many, many times, did 

she recall that night when she ran into his arms from the very man 

now projecting his hateful gaze into the darkness where she sat, 

and leering through the glass in monstrous admiration!  And when 

she thought of Joe, and what a brave fellow he was, and how he 

would have rode boldly up, and dashed in among these villains now, 

yes, though they were double the number--and here she clenched her 

little hand, and pressed her foot upon the ground--the pride she 

felt for a moment in having won his heart, faded in a burst of 

tears, and she sobbed more bitterly than ever.



As the night wore on, and they proceeded by ways which were quite 

unknown to them--for they could recognise none of the objects of 

which they sometimes caught a hurried glimpse--their fears 

increased; nor were they without good foundation; it was not 

difficult for two beautiful young women to find, in their being 

borne they knew not whither by a band of daring villains who eyed 

them as some among these fellows did, reasons for the worst alarm.  

When they at last entered London, by a suburb with which they were 

wholly unacquainted, it was past midnight, and the streets were 

dark and empty.  Nor was this the worst, for the carriage stopping 

in a lonely spot, Hugh suddenly opened the door, jumped in, and 

took his seat between them.



It was in vain they cried for help.  He put his arm about the neck 

of each, and swore to stifle them with kisses if they were not as 

silent as the grave.



'I come here to keep you quiet,' he said, 'and that's the means I 

shall take.  So don't be quiet, pretty mistresses--make a noise--

do--and I shall like it all the better.'



They were proceeding at a rapid pace, and apparently with fewer 

attendants than before, though it was so dark (the torches being 

extinguished) that this was mere conjecture.  They shrunk from his 

touch, each into the farthest corner of the carriage; but shrink as 

Dolly would, his arm encircled her waist, and held her fast.  She 

neither cried nor spoke, for terror and disgust deprived her of the 

power; but she plucked at his hand as though she would die in the 

effort to disengage herself; and crouching on the ground, with her 

head averted and held down, repelled him with a strength she 

wondered at as much as he.  The carriage stopped again.



'Lift this one out,' said Hugh to the man who opened the door, as 

he took Miss Haredale's hand, and felt how heavily it fell.  'She's 

fainted.'



'So much the better,' growled Dennis--it was that amiable 

gentleman.  'She's quiet.  I always like 'em to faint, unless 

they're very tender and composed.'



'Can you take her by yourself?' asked Hugh.



'I don't know till I try.  I ought to be able to; I've lifted up a 

good many in my time,' said the hangman.  'Up then!  She's no small 

weight, brother; none of these here fine gals are.  Up again!  Now 

we have her.'



Having by this time hoisted the young lady into his arms, he 

staggered off with his burden.



'Look ye, pretty bird,' said Hugh, drawing Dolly towards him.  

'Remember what I told you--a kiss for every cry.  Scream, if you 

love me, darling.  Scream once, mistress.  Pretty mistress, only 

once, if you love me.'



Thrusting his face away with all her force, and holding down her 

head, Dolly submitted to be carried out of the chaise, and borne 

after Miss Haredale into a miserable cottage, where Hugh, after 

hugging her to his breast, set her gently down upon the floor.



Poor Dolly!  Do what she would, she only looked the better for it, 

and tempted them the more.  When her eyes flashed angrily, and her 

ripe lips slightly parted, to give her rapid breathing vent, who 

could resist it?  When she wept and sobbed as though her heart 

would break, and bemoaned her miseries in the sweetest voice that 

ever fell upon a listener's ear, who could be insensible to the 

little winning pettishness which now and then displayed itself, 

even in the sincerity and earnestness of her grief?  When, 

forgetful for a moment of herself, as she was now, she fell on her 

knees beside her friend, and bent over her, and laid her cheek to 

hers, and put her arms about her, what mortal eyes could have 

avoided wandering to the delicate bodice, the streaming hair, the 

neglected dress, the perfect abandonment and unconsciousness of the 

blooming little beauty?  Who could look on and see her lavish 

caresses and endearments, and not desire to be in Emma Haredale's 

place; to be either her or Dolly; either the hugging or the hugged?  

Not Hugh.  Not Dennis.



'I tell you what it is, young women,' said Mr Dennis, 'I an't much 

of a lady's man myself, nor am I a party in the present business 

further than lending a willing hand to my friends: but if I see 

much more of this here sort of thing, I shall become a principal 

instead of a accessory.  I tell you candid.'



'Why have you brought us here?' said Emma.  'Are we to be 

murdered?'



'Murdered!' cried Dennis, sitting down upon a stool, and regarding 

her with great favour.  'Why, my dear, who'd murder sich 

chickabiddies as you?  If you was to ask me, now, whether you was 

brought here to be married, there might be something in it.'



And here he exchanged a grin with Hugh, who removed his eyes from 

Dolly for the purpose.



'No, no,' said Dennis, 'there'll be no murdering, my pets.  Nothing 

of that sort.  Quite the contrairy.'



'You are an older man than your companion, sir,' said Emma, 

trembling.  'Have you no pity for us?  Do you not consider that we 

are women?'



'I do indeed, my dear,' retorted Dennis.  'It would be very hard 

not to, with two such specimens afore my eyes.  Ha ha!  Oh yes , I 

consider that.  We all consider that, miss.'



He shook his head waggishly, leered at Hugh again, and laughed very 

much, as if he had said a noble thing, and rather thought he was 

coming out.



'There'll be no murdering, my dear.  Not a bit on it.  I tell you 

what though, brother,' said Dennis, cocking his hat for the 

convenience of scratching his head, and looking gravely at Hugh, 

'it's worthy of notice, as a proof of the amazing equalness and 

dignity of our law, that it don't make no distinction between men 

and women.  I've heerd the judge say, sometimes, to a highwayman or 

housebreaker as had tied the ladies neck and heels--you'll excuse 

me making mention of it, my darlings--and put 'em in a cellar, that 

he showed no consideration to women.  Now, I say that there judge 

didn't know his business, brother; and that if I had been that 

there highwayman or housebreaker, I should have made answer: "What 

are you a talking of, my lord?  I showed the women as much 

consideration as the law does, and what more would you have me do?"  

If you was to count up in the newspapers the number of females as 

have been worked off in this here city alone, in the last ten 

year,' said Mr Dennis thoughtfully, 'you'd be surprised at the 

total--quite amazed, you would.  There's a dignified and equal 

thing; a beautiful thing!  But we've no security for its lasting.  

Now that they've begun to favour these here Papists, I shouldn't 

wonder if they went and altered even THAT, one of these days.  Upon 

my soul, I shouldn't.'



The subject, perhaps from being of too exclusive and professional a 

nature, failed to interest Hugh as much as his friend had 

anticipated.  But he had no time to pursue it, for at this crisis 

Mr Tappertit entered precipitately; at sight of whom Dolly uttered 

a scream of joy, and fairly threw herself into his arms.



'I knew it, I was sure of it!' cried Dolly.  'My dear father's at 

the door.  Thank God, thank God!  Bless you, Sim.  Heaven bless you 

for this!'



Simon Tappertit, who had at first implicitly believed that the 

locksmith's daughter, unable any longer to suppress her secret 

passion for himself, was about to give it full vent in its 

intensity, and to declare that she was his for ever, looked 

extremely foolish when she said these words;--the more so, as they 

were received by Hugh and Dennis with a loud laugh, which made her 

draw back, and regard him with a fixed and earnest look.



'Miss Haredale,' said Sim, after a very awkward silence, 'I hope 

you're as comfortable as circumstances will permit of.  Dolly 

Varden, my darling--my own, my lovely one--I hope YOU'RE pretty 

comfortable likewise.'



Poor little Dolly!  She saw how it was; hid her face in her hands; 

and sobbed more bitterly than ever.



'You meet in me, Miss V.,' said Simon, laying his hand upon his 

breast, 'not a 'prentice, not a workman, not a slave, not the 

wictim of your father's tyrannical behaviour, but the leader of a 

great people, the captain of a noble band, in which these gentlemen 

are, as I may say, corporals and serjeants.  You behold in me, not 

a private individual, but a public character; not a mender of 

locks, but a healer of the wounds of his unhappy country.  Dolly 

V., sweet Dolly V., for how many years have I looked forward to 

this present meeting!  For how many years has it been my intention 

to exalt and ennoble you!  I redeem it.  Behold in me, your 

husband.  Yes, beautiful Dolly--charmer--enslaver--S. Tappertit is 

all your own!'



As he said these words he advanced towards her.  Dolly retreated 

till she could go no farther, and then sank down upon the floor.  

Thinking it very possible that this might be maiden modesty, Simon 

essayed to raise her; on which Dolly, goaded to desperation, wound 

her hands in his hair, and crying out amidst her tears that he was 

a dreadful little wretch, and always had been, shook, and pulled, 

and beat him, until he was fain to call for help, most lustily.  

Hugh had never admired her half so much as at that moment.



'She's in an excited state to-night,' said Simon, as he smoothed 

his rumpled feathers, 'and don't know when she's well off.  Let her 

be by herself till to-morrow, and that'll bring her down a little.  

Carry her into the next house!'



Hugh had her in his arms directly.  It might be that Mr Tappertit's 

heart was really softened by her distress, or it might be that he 

felt it in some degree indecorous that his intended bride should be 

struggling in the grasp of another man.  He commanded him, on 

second thoughts, to put her down again, and looked moodily on as 

she flew to Miss Haredale's side, and clinging to her dress, hid 

her flushed face in its folds.



'They shall remain here together till to-morrow,' said Simon, who 

had now quite recovered his dignity--'till to-morrow.  Come away!'



'Ay!' cried Hugh.  'Come away, captain.  Ha ha ha!'



'What are you laughing at?' demanded Simon sternly.



'Nothing, captain, nothing,' Hugh rejoined; and as he spoke, and 

clapped his hand upon the shoulder of the little man, he laughed 

again, for some unknown reason, with tenfold violence.



Mr Tappertit surveyed him from head to foot with lofty scorn (this 

only made him laugh the more), and turning to the prisoners, said:



'You'll take notice, ladies, that this place is well watched on 

every side, and that the least noise is certain to be attended with 

unpleasant consequences.  You'll hear--both of you--more of our 

intentions to-morrow.  In the mean time, don't show yourselves at 

the window, or appeal to any of the people you may see pass it; for 

if you do, it'll be known directly that you come from a Catholic 

house, and all the exertions our men can make, may not be able to 

save your lives.'



With this last caution, which was true enough, he turned to the 

door, followed by Hugh and Dennis.  They paused for a moment, going 

out, to look at them clasped in each other's arms, and then left 

the cottage; fastening the door, and setting a good watch upon it, 

and indeed all round the house.



'I say,' growled Dennis, as they walked away in company, 'that's a 

dainty pair.  Muster Gashford's one is as handsome as the other, 

eh?'



'Hush!' said Hugh, hastily.  'Don't you mention names.  It's a bad 

habit.'



'I wouldn't like to be HIM, then (as you don't like names), when he 

breaks it out to her; that's all,' said Dennis.  'She's one of them 

fine, black-eyed, proud gals, as I wouldn't trust at such times 

with a knife too near 'em.  I've seen some of that sort, afore now.  

I recollect one that was worked off, many year ago--and there was a 

gentleman in that case too--that says to me, with her lip a 

trembling, but her hand as steady as ever I see one: "Dennis, I'm 

near my end, but if I had a dagger in these fingers, and he was 

within my reach, I'd strike him dead afore me;"--ah, she did--and 

she'd have done it too!'



Strike who dead?' demanded Hugh.



'How should I know, brother?' answered Dennis.  'SHE never said; 

not she.'



Hugh looked, for a moment, as though he would have made some 

further inquiry into this incoherent recollection; but Simon 

Tappertit, who had been meditating deeply, gave his thoughts a new 

direction.



'Hugh!' said Sim.  'You have done well to-day.  You shall be 

rewarded.  So have you, Dennis.--There's no young woman YOU want to 

carry off, is there?'



'N--no,' returned that gentleman, stroking his grizzly beard, which 

was some two inches long.  'None in partickler, I think.'



'Very good,' said Sim; 'then we'll find some other way of making it 

up to you.  As to you, old boy'--he turned to Hugh--'you shall have 

Miggs (her that I promised you, you know) within three days.  Mind.  

I pass my word for it.'



Hugh thanked him heartily; and as he did so, his laughing fit 

returned with such violence that he was obliged to hold his side 

with one hand, and to lean with the other on the shoulder of his 

small captain, without whose support he would certainly have rolled 

upon the ground.
