The thoughts of worldly men are for ever regulated by a moral law 

of gravitation, which, like the physical one, holds them down to 

earth.  The bright glory of day, and the silent wonders of a 

starlit night, appeal to their minds in vain.  There are no signs 

in the sun, or in the moon, or in the stars, for their reading.  

They are like some wise men, who, learning to know each planet by 

its Latin name, have quite forgotten such small heavenly 

constellations as Charity, Forbearance, Universal Love, and Mercy, 

although they shine by night and day so brightly that the blind may 

see them; and who, looking upward at the spangled sky, see nothing 

there but the reflection of their own great wisdom and book-

learning.



It is curious to imagine these people of the world, busy in 

thought, turning their eyes towards the countless spheres that 

shine above us, and making them reflect the only images their minds 

contain.  The man who lives but in the breath of princes, has 

nothing his sight but stars for courtiers' breasts.  The envious 

man beholds his neighbours' honours even in the sky; to the money-

hoarder, and the mass of worldly folk, the whole great universe 

above glitters with sterling coin--fresh from the mint--stamped 

with the sovereign's head--coming always between them and heaven, 

turn where they may.  So do the shadows of our own desires stand 

between us and our better angels, and thus their brightness is 

eclipsed.



Everything was fresh and gay, as though the world were but that 

morning made, when Mr Chester rode at a tranquil pace along the 

Forest road.  Though early in the season, it was warm and genial 

weather; the trees were budding into leaf, the hedges and the grass 

were green, the air was musical with songs of birds, and high above 

them all the lark poured out her richest melody.  In shady spots, 

the morning dew sparkled on each young leaf and blade of grass; 

and where the sun was shining, some diamond drops yet glistened 

brightly, as in unwillingness to leave so fair a world, and have 

such brief existence.  Even the light wind, whose rustling was as 

gentle to the ear as softly-falling water, had its hope and 

promise; and, leaving a pleasant fragrance in its track as it went 

fluttering by, whispered of its intercourse with Summer, and of his 

happy coming.



The solitary rider went glancing on among the trees, from sunlight 

into shade and back again, at the same even pace--looking about 

him, certainly, from time to time, but with no greater thought of 

the day or the scene through which he moved, than that he was 

fortunate (being choicely dressed) to have such favourable weather.  

He smiled very complacently at such times, but rather as if he were 

satisfied with himself than with anything else: and so went riding 

on, upon his chestnut cob, as pleasant to look upon as his own 

horse, and probably far less sensitive to the many cheerful 

influences by which he was surrounded.



In the course of time, the Maypole's massive chimneys rose upon his 

view: but he quickened not his pace one jot, and with the same cool 

gravity rode up to the tavern porch.  John Willet, who was toasting 

his red face before a great fire in the bar, and who, with 

surpassing foresight and quickness of apprehension, had been 

thinking, as he looked at the blue sky, that if that state of 

things lasted much longer, it might ultimately become necessary to 

leave off fires and throw the windows open, issued forth to hold 

his stirrup; calling lustily for Hugh.



'Oh, you're here, are you, sir?' said John, rather surprised by the 

quickness with which he appeared.  'Take this here valuable animal 

into the stable, and have more than particular care of him if you 

want to keep your place.  A mortal lazy fellow, sir; he needs a 

deal of looking after.'



'But you have a son,' returned Mr Chester, giving his bridle to 

Hugh as he dismounted, and acknowledging his salute by a careless 

motion of his hand towards his hat.  'Why don't you make HIM 

useful?'



'Why, the truth is, sir,' replied John with great importance, 'that 

my son--what, you're a-listening are you, villain?'



'Who's listening?' returned Hugh angrily.  'A treat, indeed, to 

hear YOU speak!  Would you have me take him in till he's cool?'



'Walk him up and down further off then, sir,' cried old John, 'and 

when you see me and a noble gentleman entertaining ourselves with 

talk, keep your distance.  If you don't know your distance, sir,' 

added Mr Willet, after an enormously long pause, during which he 

fixed his great dull eyes on Hugh, and waited with exemplary 

patience for any little property in the way of ideas that might 

come to him, 'we'll find a way to teach you, pretty soon.'



Hugh shrugged his shoulders scornfully, and in his reckless 

swaggering way, crossed to the other side of the little green, and 

there, with the bridle slung loosely over his shoulder, led the 

horse to and fro, glancing at his master every now and then from 

under his bushy eyebrows, with as sinister an aspect as one would 

desire to see.



Mr Chester, who, without appearing to do so, had eyed him 

attentively during this brief dispute, stepped into the porch, and 

turning abruptly to Mr Willet, said,



'You keep strange servants, John.'



'Strange enough to look at, sir, certainly,' answered the host; 

'but out of doors; for horses, dogs, and the likes of that; there 

an't a better man in England than is that Maypole Hugh yonder.  He 

an't fit for indoors,' added Mr Willet, with the confidential air 

of a man who felt his own superior nature.  'I do that; but if that 

chap had only a little imagination, sir--'



'He's an active fellow now, I dare swear,' said Mr Chester, in a 

musing tone, which seemed to suggest that he would have said the 

same had there been nobody to hear him.



'Active, sir!' retorted John, with quite an expression in his face; 

'that chap!  Hallo there!  You, sir!  Bring that horse here, and 

go and hang my wig on the weathercock, to show this gentleman 

whether you're one of the lively sort or not.'



Hugh made no answer, but throwing the bridle to his master, and 

snatching his wig from his head, in a manner so unceremonious and 

hasty that the action discomposed Mr Willet not a little, though 

performed at his own special desire, climbed nimbly to the very 

summit of the maypole before the house, and hanging the wig upon 

the weathercock, sent it twirling round like a roasting jack.  

Having achieved this performance, he cast it on the ground, and 

sliding down the pole with inconceivable rapidity, alighted on his 

feet almost as soon as it had touched the earth.



'There, sir,' said John, relapsing into his usual stolid state, 

'you won't see that at many houses, besides the Maypole, where 

there's good accommodation for man and beast--nor that neither, 

though that with him is nothing.'



This last remark bore reference to his vaulting on horseback, as 

upon Mr Chester's first visit, and quickly disappearing by the 

stable gate.



'That with him is nothing,' repeated Mr Willet, brushing his wig 

with his wrist, and inwardly resolving to distribute a small charge 

for dust and damage to that article of dress, through the various 

items of his guest's bill; 'he'll get out of a'most any winder in 

the house.  There never was such a chap for flinging himself about 

and never hurting his bones.  It's my opinion, sir, that it's 

pretty nearly allowing to his not having any imagination; and that 

if imagination could be (which it can't) knocked into him, he'd 

never be able to do it any more.  But we was a-talking, sir, about 

my son.'



'True, Willet, true,' said his visitor, turning again towards the 

landlord with his accustomed serenity of face.  'My good friend, 

what about him?'



It has been reported that Mr Willet, previously to making answer, 

winked.  But as he was never known to be guilty of such lightness 

of conduct either before or afterwards, this may be looked upon as 

a malicious invention of his enemies--founded, perhaps, upon the 

undisputed circumstance of his taking his guest by the third breast 

button of his coat, counting downwards from the chin, and pouring 

his reply into his ear:



'Sir,' whispered John, with dignity, 'I know my duty.  We want no 

love-making here, sir, unbeknown to parents.  I respect a certain 

young gentleman, taking him in the light of a young gentleman; I 

respect a certain young lady, taking her in the light of a young 

lady; but of the two as a couple, I have no knowledge, sir, none 

whatever.  My son, sir, is upon his patrole.'



'I thought I saw him looking through the corner window but this 

moment,' said Mr Chester, who naturally thought that being on 

patrole, implied walking about somewhere.



'No doubt you did, sir,' returned John.  'He is upon his patrole of 

honour, sir, not to leave the premises.  Me and some friends of 

mine that use the Maypole of an evening, sir, considered what was 

best to be done with him, to prevent his doing anything unpleasant 

in opposing your desires; and we've put him on his patrole.  And 

what's more, sir, he won't be off his patrole for a pretty long 

time to come, I can tell you that.'



When he had communicated this bright idea, which had its origin in 

the perusal by the village cronies of a newspaper, containing, 

among other matters, an account of how some officer pending the 

sentence of some court-martial had been enlarged on parole, Mr 

Willet drew back from his guest's ear, and without any visible 

alteration of feature, chuckled thrice audibly.  This nearest 

approach to a laugh in which he ever indulged (and that but seldom 

and only on extreme occasions), never even curled his lip or 

effected the smallest change in--no, not so much as a slight 

wagging of--his great, fat, double chin, which at these times, as 

at all others, remained a perfect desert in the broad map of his 

face; one changeless, dull, tremendous blank.



Lest it should be matter of surprise to any, that Mr Willet adopted 

this bold course in opposition to one whom he had often 

entertained, and who had always paid his way at the Maypole 

gallantly, it may be remarked that it was his very penetration and 

sagacity in this respect, which occasioned him to indulge in those 

unusual demonstrations of jocularity, just now recorded.  For Mr 

Willet, after carefully balancing father and son in his mental 

scales, had arrived at the distinct conclusion that the old 

gentleman was a better sort of a customer than the young one.  

Throwing his landlord into the same scale, which was already turned 

by this consideration, and heaping upon him, again, his strong 

desires to run counter to the unfortunate Joe, and his opposition 

as a general principle to all matters of love and matrimony, it 

went down to the very ground straightway, and sent the light cause 

of the younger gentleman flying upwards to the ceiling.  Mr 

Chester was not the kind of man to be by any means dim-sighted to 

Mr Willet's motives, but he thanked him as graciously as if he had 

been one of the most disinterested martyrs that ever shone on 

earth; and leaving him, with many complimentary reliances on his 

great taste and judgment, to prepare whatever dinner he might deem 

most fitting the occasion, bent his steps towards the Warren.



Dressed with more than his usual elegance; assuming a gracefulness 

of manner, which, though it was the result of long study, sat 

easily upon him and became him well; composing his features into 

their most serene and prepossessing expression; and setting in 

short that guard upon himself, at every point, which denoted that 

he attached no slight importance to the impression he was about to 

make; he entered the bounds of Miss Haredale's usual walk.  He had 

not gone far, or looked about him long, when he descried coming 

towards him, a female figure.  A glimpse of the form and dress as 

she crossed a little wooden bridge which lay between them, 

satisfied him that he had found her whom he desired to see.  He 

threw himself in her way, and a very few paces brought them close 

together.



He raised his hat from his head, and yielding the path, suffered 

her to pass him.  Then, as if the idea had but that moment 

occurred to him, he turned hastily back and said in an agitated 

voice:



'I beg pardon--do I address Miss Haredale?'



She stopped in some confusion at being so unexpectedly accosted by 

a stranger; and answered 'Yes.'



'Something told me,' he said, LOOKING a compliment to her beauty, 

'that it could be no other.  Miss Haredale, I bear a name which is 

not unknown to you--which it is a pride, and yet a pain to me to 

know, sounds pleasantly in your ears.  I am a man advanced in life, 

as you see.  I am the father of him whom you honour and distinguish 

above all other men.  May I for weighty reasons which fill me with 

distress, beg but a minute's conversation with you here?'



Who that was inexperienced in deceit, and had a frank and youthful 

heart, could doubt the speaker's truth--could doubt it too, when 

the voice that spoke, was like the faint echo of one she knew so 

well, and so much loved to hear?  She inclined her head, and 

stopping, cast her eyes upon the ground.



'A little more apart--among these trees.  It is an old man's hand, 

Miss Haredale; an honest one, believe me.'



She put hers in it as he said these words, and suffered him to lead 

her to a neighbouring seat.



'You alarm me, sir,' she said in a low voice.  'You are not the 

bearer of any ill news, I hope?'



'Of none that you anticipate,' he answered, sitting down beside 

her.  'Edward is well--quite well.  It is of him I wish to speak, 

certainly; but I have no misfortune to communicate.'



She bowed her head again, and made as though she would have begged 

him to proceed; but said nothing.



'I am sensible that I speak to you at a disadvantage, dear Miss 

Haredale.  Believe me that I am not so forgetful of the feelings of 

my younger days as not to know that you are little disposed to view 

me with favour.  You have heard me described as cold-hearted, 

calculating, selfish--'



'I have never, sir,'--she interposed with an altered manner and a 

firmer voice; 'I have never heard you spoken of in harsh or 

disrespectful terms.  You do a great wrong to Edward's nature if 

you believe him capable of any mean or base proceeding.'



'Pardon me, my sweet young lady, but your uncle--'



'Nor is it my uncle's nature either,' she replied, with a 

heightened colour in her cheek.  'It is not his nature to stab in 

the dark, nor is it mine to love such deeds.'



She rose as she spoke, and would have left him; but he detained her 

with a gentle hand, and besought her in such persuasive accents to 

hear him but another minute, that she was easily prevailed upon to 

comply, and so sat down again.



'And it is,' said Mr Chester, looking upward, and apostrophising 

the air; 'it is this frank, ingenuous, noble nature, Ned, that you 

can wound so lightly.  Shame--shame upon you, boy!'



She turned towards him quickly, and with a scornful look and 

flashing eyes.  There were tears in Mr Chester's eyes, but he 

dashed them hurriedly away, as though unwilling that his weakness 

should be known, and regarded her with mingled admiration and 

compassion.



'I never until now,' he said, 'believed, that the frivolous actions 

of a young man could move me like these of my own son.  I never 

knew till now, the worth of a woman's heart, which boys so lightly 

win, and lightly fling away.  Trust me, dear young lady, that I 

never until now did know your worth; and though an abhorrence of 

deceit and falsehood has impelled me to seek you out, and would 

have done so had you been the poorest and least gifted of your sex, 

I should have lacked the fortitude to sustain this interview could 

I have pictured you to my imagination as you really are.'



Oh!  If Mrs Varden could have seen the virtuous gentleman as he 

said these words, with indignation sparkling from his eyes--if she 

could have heard his broken, quavering voice--if she could have 

beheld him as he stood bareheaded in the sunlight, and with 

unwonted energy poured forth his eloquence!



With a haughty face, but pale and trembling too, Emma regarded him 

in silence.  She neither spoke nor moved, but gazed upon him as 

though she would look into his heart.



'I throw off,' said Mr Chester, 'the restraint which natural 

affection would impose on some men, and reject all bonds but those 

of truth and duty.  Miss Haredale, you are deceived; you are 

deceived by your unworthy lover, and my unworthy son.'



Still she looked at him steadily, and still said not one word.



'I have ever opposed his professions of love for you; you will do 

me the justice, dear Miss Haredale, to remember that.  Your uncle 

and myself were enemies in early life, and if I had sought 

retaliation, I might have found it here.  But as we grow older, we 

grow wiser--bitter, I would fain hope--and from the first, I have 

opposed him in this attempt.  I foresaw the end, and would have 

spared you, if I could.'



'Speak plainly, sir,' she faltered.  'You deceive me, or are 

deceived yourself.  I do not believe you--I cannot--I should not.'



'First,' said Mr Chester, soothingly, 'for there may be in your 

mind some latent angry feeling to which I would not appeal, pray 

take this letter.  It reached my hands by chance, and by mistake, 

and should have accounted to you (as I am told) for my son's not 

answering some other note of yours.  God forbid, Miss Haredale,' 

said the good gentleman, with great emotion, 'that there should be 

in your gentle breast one causeless ground of quarrel with him.  

You should know, and you will see, that he was in no fault here.'



There appeared something so very candid, so scrupulously 

honourable, so very truthful and just in this course something 

which rendered the upright person who resorted to it, so worthy of 

belief--that Emma's heart, for the first time, sunk within her.  

She turned away and burst into tears.



'I would,' said Mr Chester, leaning over her, and speaking in mild 

and quite venerable accents; 'I would, dear girl, it were my task 

to banish, not increase, those tokens of your grief.  My son, my 

erring son,--I will not call him deliberately criminal in this, for 

men so young, who have been inconstant twice or thrice before, act 

without reflection, almost without a knowledge of the wrong they 

do,--will break his plighted faith to you; has broken it even now.  

Shall I stop here, and having given you this warning, leave it to 

be fulfilled; or shall I go on?'



'You will go on, sir,' she answered, 'and speak more plainly yet, 

in justice both to him and me.'



'My dear girl,' said Mr Chester, bending over her more 

affectionately still; 'whom I would call my daughter, but the Fates 

forbid, Edward seeks to break with you upon a false and most 

unwarrantable pretence.  I have it on his own showing; in his own 

hand.  Forgive me, if I have had a watch upon his conduct; I am his 

father; I had a regard for your peace and his honour, and no better 

resource was left me.  There lies on his desk at this present 

moment, ready for transmission to you, a letter, in which he tells 

you that our poverty--our poverty; his and mine, Miss Haredale--

forbids him to pursue his claim upon your hand; in which he offers, 

voluntarily proposes, to free you from your pledge; and talks 

magnanimously (men do so, very commonly, in such cases) of being in 

time more worthy of your regard--and so forth.  A letter, to be 

plain, in which he not only jilts you--pardon the word; I would 

summon to your aid your pride and dignity--not only jilts you, I 

fear, in favour of the object whose slighting treatment first 

inspired his brief passion for yourself and gave it birth in 

wounded vanity, but affects to make a merit and a virtue of the 

act.'



She glanced proudly at him once more, as by an involuntary impulse, 

and with a swelling breast rejoined, 'If what you say be true, he 

takes much needless trouble, sir, to compass his design.  He's very 

tender of my peace of mind.  I quite thank him.'



'The truth of what I tell you, dear young lady,' he replied, 'you 

will test by the receipt or non-receipt of the letter of which I 

speak.  Haredale, my dear fellow, I am delighted to see you, 

although we meet under singular circumstances, and upon a 

melancholy occasion.  I hope you are very well.'



At these words the young lady raised her eyes, which were filled 

with tears; and seeing that her uncle indeed stood before them, and 

being quite unequal to the trial of hearing or of speaking one word 

more, hurriedly withdrew, and left them.  They stood looking at 

each other, and at her retreating figure, and for a long time 

neither of them spoke.



'What does this mean?  Explain it,' said Mr Haredale at length.  

'Why are you here, and why with her?'



'My dear friend,' rejoined the other, resuming his accustomed 

manner with infinite readiness, and throwing himself upon the bench 

with a weary air, 'you told me not very long ago, at that 

delightful old tavern of which you are the esteemed proprietor (and 

a most charming establishment it is for persons of rural pursuits 

and in robust health, who are not liable to take cold), that I had 

the head and heart of an evil spirit in all matters of deception.  

I thought at the time; I really did think; you flattered me.  But 

now I begin to wonder at your discernment, and vanity apart, do 

honestly believe you spoke the truth.  Did you ever counterfeit 

extreme ingenuousness and honest indignation?  My dear fellow, you 

have no conception, if you never did, how faint the effort makes 

one.'



Mr Haredale surveyed him with a look of cold contempt.  'You may 

evade an explanation, I know,' he said, folding his arms.  'But I 

must have it.  I can wait.'



'Not at all.  Not at all, my good fellow.  You shall not wait a 

moment,' returned his friend, as he lazily crossed his legs.  'The 

simplest thing in the world.  It lies in a nutshell.  Ned has 

written her a letter--a boyish, honest, sentimental composition, 

which remains as yet in his desk, because he hasn't had the heart 

to send it.  I have taken a liberty, for which my parental 

affection and anxiety are a sufficient excuse, and possessed 

myself of the contents.  I have described them to your niece (a 

most enchanting person, Haredale; quite an angelic creature), with 

a little colouring and description adapted to our purpose.  It's 

done.  You may be quite easy.  It's all over.  Deprived of their 

adherents and mediators; her pride and jealousy roused to the 

utmost; with nobody to undeceive her, and you to confirm me; you 

will find that their intercourse will close with her answer.  If 

she receives Ned's letter by to-morrow noon, you may date their 

parting from to-morrow night.  No thanks, I beg; you owe me none.  

I have acted for myself; and if I have forwarded our compact with 

all the ardour even you could have desired, I have done so 

selfishly, indeed.'



'I curse the compact, as you call it, with my whole heart and 

soul,' returned the other.  'It was made in an evil hour.  I have 

bound myself to a lie; I have leagued myself with you; and though I 

did so with a righteous motive, and though it cost me such an 

effort as haply few men know, I hate and despise myself for the 

deed.'



'You are very warm,' said Mr Chester with a languid smile.



'I AM warm.  I am maddened by your coldness.  'Death, Chester, if 

your blood ran warmer in your veins, and there were no restraints 

upon me, such as those that hold and drag me back--well; it is 

done; you tell me so, and on such a point I may believe you.  When 

I am most remorseful for this treachery, I will think of you and 

your marriage, and try to justify myself in such remembrances, for 

having torn asunder Emma and your son, at any cost.  Our bond is 

cancelled now, and we may part.'



Mr Chester kissed his hand gracefully; and with the same tranquil 

face he had preserved throughout--even when he had seen his 

companion so tortured and transported by his passion that his whole 

frame was shaken--lay in his lounging posture on the seat and 

watched him as he walked away.



'My scapegoat and my drudge at school,' he said, raising his head 

to look after him; 'my friend of later days, who could not keep his 

mistress when he had won her, and threw me in her way to carry off 

the prize; I triumph in the present and the past.  Bark on, ill-

favoured, ill-conditioned cur; fortune has ever been with me--I 

like to hear you.'



The spot where they had met, was in an avenue of trees.  Mr 

Haredale not passing out on either hand, had walked straight on.  

He chanced to turn his head when at some considerable distance, and 

seeing that his late companion had by that time risen and was 

looking after him, stood still as though he half expected him to 

follow and waited for his coming up.



'It MAY come to that one day, but not yet,' said Mr Chester, 

waving his hand, as though they were the best of friends, and 

turning away.  'Not yet, Haredale.  Life is pleasant enough to me; 

dull and full of heaviness to you.  No.  To cross swords with such 

a man--to indulge his humour unless upon extremity--would be weak 

indeed.'



For all that, he drew his sword as he walked along, and in an 

absent humour ran his eye from hilt to point full twenty times.  

But thoughtfulness begets wrinkles; remembering this, he soon put
