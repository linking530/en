All next day, Emma Haredale, Dolly, and Miggs, remained cooped up 

together in what had now been their prison for so many days, 

without seeing any person, or hearing any sound but the murmured 

conversation, in an outer room, of the men who kept watch over 

them.  There appeared to be more of these fellows than there had 

been hitherto; and they could no longer hear the voices of women, 

which they had before plainly distinguished.  Some new excitement, 

too, seemed to prevail among them; for there was much stealthy 

going in and out, and a constant questioning of those who were 

newly arrived.  They had previously been quite reckless in their 

behaviour; often making a great uproar; quarrelling among 

themselves, fighting, dancing, and singing.  They were now very 

subdued and silent, conversing almost in whispers, and stealing in 

and out with a soft and stealthy tread, very different from the 

boisterous trampling in which their arrivals and departures had 

hitherto been announced to the trembling captives.



Whether this change was occasioned by the presence among them of 

some person of authority in their ranks, or by any other cause, 

they were unable to decide.  Sometimes they thought it was in part 

attributable to there being a sick man in the chamber, for last 

night there had been a shuffling of feet, as though a burden were 

brought in, and afterwards a moaning noise.  But they had no means 

of ascertaining the truth: for any question or entreaty on their 

parts only provoked a storm of execrations, or something worse; and 

they were too happy to be left alone, unassailed by threats or 

admiration, to risk even that comfort, by any voluntary 

communication with those who held them in durance.



It was sufficiently evident, both to Emma and to the locksmith's 

poor little daughter herself, that she, Dolly, was the great 

object of attraction; and that so soon as they should have leisure 

to indulge in the softer passion, Hugh and Mr Tappertit would 

certainly fall to blows for her sake; in which latter case, it was 

not very difficult to see whose prize she would become.  With all 

her old horror of that man revived, and deepened into a degree of 

aversion and abhorrence which no language can describe; with a 

thousand old recollections and regrets, and causes of distress, 

anxiety, and fear, besetting her on all sides; poor Dolly Varden--

sweet, blooming, buxom Dolly--began to hang her head, and fade, and 

droop, like a beautiful flower.  The colour fled from her cheeks, 

her courage forsook her, her gentle heart failed.  Unmindful of all 

her provoking caprices, forgetful of all her conquests and 

inconstancy, with all her winning little vanities quite gone, she 

nestled all the livelong day in Emma Haredale's bosom; and, 

sometimes calling on her dear old grey-haired father, sometimes on 

her mother, and sometimes even on her old home, pined slowly away, 

like a poor bird in its cage.



Light hearts, light hearts, that float so gaily on a smooth stream, 

that are so sparkling and buoyant in the sunshine--down upon fruit, 

bloom upon flowers, blush in summer air, life of the winged insect, 

whose whole existence is a day--how soon ye sink in troubled water!  

Poor Dolly's heart--a little, gentle, idle, fickle thing; giddy, 

restless, fluttering; constant to nothing but bright looks, and 

smiles and laughter--Dolly's heart was breaking.



Emma had known grief, and could bear it better.  She had little 

comfort to impart, but she could soothe and tend her, and she did 

so; and Dolly clung to her like a child to its nurse.  In 

endeavouring to inspire her with some fortitude, she increased her 

own; and though the nights were long, and the days dismal, and she 

felt the wasting influence of watching and fatigue, and had 

perhaps a more defined and clear perception of their destitute 

condition and its worst dangers, she uttered no complaint.  Before 

the ruffians, in whose power they were, she bore herself so 

calmly, and with such an appearance, in the midst of all her 

terror, of a secret conviction that they dared not harm her, that 

there was not a man among them but held her in some degree of 

dread; and more than one believed she had a weapon hidden in her 

dress, and was prepared to use it.



Such was their condition when they were joined by Miss Miggs, who 

gave them to understand that she too had been taken prisoner 

because of her charms, and detailed such feats of resistance she 

had performed (her virtue having given her supernatural strength), 

that they felt it quite a happiness to have her for a champion.  

Nor was this the only comfort they derived at first from Miggs's 

presence and society: for that young lady displayed such 

resignation and long-suffering, and so much meek endurance, under 

her trials, and breathed in all her chaste discourse a spirit of 

such holy confidence and resignation, and devout belief that all 

would happen for the best, that Emma felt her courage strengthened 

by the bright example; never doubting but that everything she said 

was true, and that she, like them, was torn from all she loved, and 

agonised by doubt and apprehension.  As to poor Dolly, she was 

roused, at first, by seeing one who came from home; but when she 

heard under what circumstances she had left it, and into whose 

hands her father had fallen, she wept more bitterly than ever, and 

refused all comfort.



Miss Miggs was at some trouble to reprove her for this state of 

mind, and to entreat her to take example by herself, who, she 

said, was now receiving back, with interest, tenfold the amount of 

her subscriptions to the red-brick dwelling-house, in the articles 

of peace of mind and a quiet conscience.  And, while on serious 

topics, Miss Miggs considered it her duty to try her hand at the 

conversion of Miss Haredale; for whose improvement she launched 

into a polemical address of some length, in the course whereof, 

she likened herself unto a chosen missionary, and that young lady 

to a cannibal in darkness.  Indeed, she returned so often to these 

sublects, and so frequently called upon them to take a lesson from 

her,--at the same time vaunting and, as it were, rioting in, her 

huge unworthiness, and abundant excess of sin,--that, in the course 

of a short time, she became, in that small chamber, rather a 

nuisance than a comfort, and rendered them, if possible, even more 

unhappy than they had been before.



The night had now come; and for the first time (for their jailers 

had been regular in bringing food and candles), they were left in 

darkness.  Any change in their condition in such a place inspired 

new fears; and when some hours had passed, and the gloom was still 

unbroken, Emma could no longer repress her alarm.



They listened attentively.  There was the same murmuring in the 

outer room, and now and then a moan which seemed to be wrung from a 

person in great pain, who made an effort to subdue it, but could 

not.  Even these men seemed to be in darkness too; for no light 

shone through the chinks in the door, nor were they moving, as 

their custom was, but quite still: the silence being unbroken by 

so much as the creaking of a board.



At first, Miss Miggs wondered greatly in her own mind who this sick 

person might be; but arriving, on second thoughts, at the 

conclusion that he was a part of the schemes on foot, and an artful 

device soon to be employed with great success, she opined, for Miss 

Haredale's comfort, that it must be some misguided Papist who had 

been wounded: and this happy supposition encouraged her to say, 

under her breath, 'Ally Looyer!' several times.



'Is it possible,' said Emma, with some indignation, 'that you who 

have seen these men committing the outrages you have told us of, 

and who have fallen into their hands, like us, can exult in their 

cruelties!'



'Personal considerations, miss,' rejoined Miggs, 'sinks into 

nothing, afore a noble cause.  Ally Looyer!  Ally Looyer!  Ally 

Looyer, good gentlemen!'



It seemed from the shrill pertinacity with which Miss Miggs 

repeated this form of acclamation, that she was calling the same 

through the keyhole of the door; but in the profound darkness she 

could not be seen.



'If the time has come--Heaven knows it may come at any moment--when 

they are bent on prosecuting the designs, whatever they may be, 

with which they have brought us here, can you still encourage, and 

take part with them?' demanded Emma.



'I thank my goodness-gracious-blessed-stars I can, miss,' returned 

Miggs, with increased energy.--'Ally Looyer, good gentlemen!'



Even Dolly, cast down and disappointed as she was, revived at this, 

and bade Miggs hold her tongue directly.



'WHICH, was you pleased to observe, Miss Varden?' said Miggs, with 

a strong emphasis on the irrelative pronoun.



Dolly repeated her request.



'Ho, gracious me!' cried Miggs, with hysterical derision.  'Ho, 

gracious me!  Yes, to be sure I will.  Ho yes!  I am a abject 

slave, and a toiling, moiling, constant-working, always-being-

found-fault-with, never-giving-satisfactions, nor-having-no-

time-to-clean-oneself, potter's wessel--an't I, miss!  Ho yes!  My 

situations is lowly, and my capacities is limited, and my duties is 

to humble myself afore the base degenerating daughters of their 

blessed mothers as is--fit to keep companies with holy saints but 

is born to persecutions from wicked relations--and to demean myself 

before them as is no better than Infidels--an't it, miss!  Ho yes!  

My only becoming occupations is to help young flaunting pagins to 

brush and comb and titiwate theirselves into whitening and 

suppulchres, and leave the young men to think that there an't a bit 

of padding in it nor no pinching ins nor fillings out nor pomatums 

nor deceits nor earthly wanities--an't it, miss!  Yes, to be sure 

it is--ho yes!'



Having delivered these ironical passages with a most wonderful 

volubility, and with a shrillness perfectly deafening (especially 

when she jerked out the interjections), Miss Miggs, from mere 

habit, and not because weeping was at all appropriate to the 

occasion, which was one of triumph, concluded by bursting into a 

flood of tears, and calling in an impassioned manner on the name of 

Simmuns.



What Emma Haredale and Dolly would have done, or how long Miss 

Miggs, now that she had hoisted her true colours, would have gone 

on waving them before their astonished senses, it is impossible to 

tell.  Nor is it necessary to speculate on these matters, for a 

startling interruption occurred at that moment, which took their 

whole attention by storm.



This was a violent knocking at the door of the house, and then its 

sudden bursting open; which was immediately succeeded by a scuffle 

in the room without, and the clash of weapons.  Transported with 

the hope that rescue had at length arrived, Emma and Dolly shrieked 

aloud for help; nor were their shrieks unanswered; for after a 

hurried interval, a man, bearing in one hand a drawn sword, and in 

the other a taper, rushed into the chamber where they were confined.



It was some check upon their transport to find in this person an 

entire stranger, but they appealed to him, nevertheless, and 

besought him, in impassioned language, to restore them to their 

friends.



'For what other purpose am I here?' he answered, closing the door, 

and standing with his back against it.  'With what object have I 

made my way to this place, through difficulty and danger, but to 

preserve you?'



With a joy for which it was impossible to find adequate expression, 

they embraced each other, and thanked Heaven for this most timely 

aid.  Their deliverer stepped forward for a moment to put the light 

upon the table, and immediately returning to his former position 

against the door, bared his head, and looked on smilingly.



'You have news of my uncle, sir?' said Emma, turning hastily 

towards him.



'And of my father and mother?' added Dolly.



'Yes,' he said.  'Good news.'



'They are alive and unhurt?' they both cried at once.



'Yes, and unhurt,' he rejoined.



'And close at hand?'



'I did not say close at hand,' he answered smoothly; 'they are at 

no great distance.  YOUR friends, sweet one,' he added, addressing 

Dolly, 'are within a few hours' journey.  You will be restored to 

them, I hope, to-night.'



'My uncle, sir--' faltered Emma.



'Your uncle, dear Miss Haredale, happily--I say happily, because he 

has succeeded where many of our creed have failed, and is safe--has 

crossed the sea, and is out of Britain.'



'I thank God for it,' said Emma, faintly.



'You say well.  You have reason to be thankful: greater reason 

than it is possible for you, who have seen but one night of these 

cruel outrages, to imagine.'



'Does he desire,' said Emma, 'that I should follow him?'



'Do you ask if he desires it?' cried the stranger in surprise.  'IF 

he desires it!  But you do not know the danger of remaining in 

England, the difficulty of escape, or the price hundreds would pay 

to secure the means, when you make that inquiry.  Pardon me.  I had 

forgotten that you could not, being prisoner here.'



'I gather, sir,' said Emma, after a moment's pause, 'from what you 

hint at, but fear to tell me, that I have witnessed but the 

beginning, and the least, of the violence to which we are exposed, 

and that it has not yet slackened in its fury?'



He shrugged his shoulders, shook his head, lifted up his hands; and 

with the same smooth smile, which was not a pleasant one to see, 

cast his eyes upon the ground, and remained silent.



'You may venture, sir, to speak plain,' said Emma, 'and to tell me 

the worst.  We have undergone some preparation for it.'



But here Dolly interposed, and entreated her not to hear the worst, 

but the best; and besought the gentleman to tell them the best, and 

to keep the remainder of his news until they were safe among their 

friends again.



'It is told in three words,' he said, glancing at the locksmith's 

daughter with a look of some displeasure.  'The people have risen, 

to a man, against us; the streets are filled with soldiers, who 

support them and do their bidding.  We have no protection but from 

above, and no safety but in flight; and that is a poor resource; 

for we are watched on every hand, and detained here, both by force 

and fraud.  Miss Haredale, I cannot bear--believe me, that I cannot 

bear--by speaking of myself, or what I have done, or am prepared 

to do, to seem to vaunt my services before you.  But, having 

powerful Protestant connections, and having my whole wealth 

embarked with theirs in shipping and commerce, I happily possessed 

the means of saving your uncle.  I have the means of saving you; 

and in redemption of my sacred promise, made to him, I am here; 

pledged not to leave you until I have placed you in his arms.  The 

treachery or penitence of one of the men about you, led to the 

discovery of your place of confinement; and that I have forced my 

way here, sword in hand, you see.'



'You bring,' said Emma, faltering, 'some note or token from my 

uncle?'



'No, he doesn't,' cried Dolly, pointing at him earnestly; 'now I am 

sure he doesn't.  Don't go with him for the world!'



'Hush, pretty fool--be silent,' he replied, frowning angrily upon 

her.  'No, Miss Haredale, I have no letter, nor any token of any 

kind; for while I sympathise with you, and such as you, on whom 

misfortune so heavy and so undeserved has fallen, I value my life.  

I carry, therefore, no writing which, found upon me, would lead to 

its certain loss.  I never thought of bringing any other token, nor 

did Mr Haredale think of entrusting me with one--possibly because 

he had good experience of my faith and honesty, and owed his life 

to me.'




There was a reproof conveyed in these words, which to a nature like 

Emma Haredale's, was well addressed.  But Dolly, who was 

differently constituted, was by no means touched by it, and still 

conjured her, in all the terms of affection and attachment she 

could think of, not to be lured away.



'Time presses,' said their visitor, who, although he sought to 

express the deepest interest, had something cold and even in his 

speech, that grated on the ear; 'and danger surrounds us.  If I 

have exposed myself to it, in vain, let it be so; but if you and he 

should ever meet again, do me justice.  If you decide to remain (as 

I think you do), remember, Miss Haredale, that I left you with a 

solemn caution, and acquitting myself of all the consequences to 

which you expose yourself.'



'Stay, sir!' cried Emma--one moment, I beg you.  Cannot we--and she 

drew Dolly closer to her--'cannot we go together?'



'The task of conveying one female in safety through such scenes as 

we must encounter, to say nothing of attracting the attention of 

those who crowd the streets,' he answered, 'is enough.  I have said 

that she will be restored to her friends to-night.  If you accept 

the service I tender, Miss Haredale, she shall be instantly placed 

in safe conduct, and that promise redeemed.  Do you decide to 

remain?  People of all ranks and creeds are flying from the town, 

which is sacked from end to end.  Let me be of use in some 

quarter.  Do you stay, or go?'



'Dolly,' said Emma, in a hurried manner, 'my dear girl, this is our 

last hope.  If we part now, it is only that we may meet again in 

happiness and honour.  I will trust to this gentleman.'



'No no-no!' cried Dolly, clinging to her.  'Pray, pray, do not!'



'You hear,' said Emma, 'that to-night--only to-night--within a few 

hours--think of that!--you will be among those who would die of 

grief to lose you, and who are now plunged in the deepest misery 

for your sake.  Pray for me, dear girl, as I will for you; and 

never forget the many quiet hours we have passed together.  Say 

one "God bless you!"  Say that at parting!'



But Dolly could say nothing; no, not when Emma kissed her cheek a 

hundred times, and covered it with tears, could she do more than 

hang upon her neck, and sob, and clasp, and hold her tight.



'We have time for no more of this,' cried the man, unclenching her 

hands, and pushing her roughly off, as he drew Emma Haredale 

towards the door: 'Now!  Quick, outside there! are you ready?'



'Ay!' cried a loud voice, which made him start.  'Quite ready!  

Stand back here, for your lives!'



And in an instant he was felled like an ox in the butcher's 

shambles--struck down as though a block of marble had fallen from 

the roof and crushed him--and cheerful light, and beaming faces 

came pouring in--and Emma was clasped in her uncle's embrace, and 

Dolly, with a shriek that pierced the air, fell into the arms of 

her father and mother.



What fainting there was, what laughing, what crying, what sobbing, 

what smiling, how much questioning, no answering, all talking 

together, all beside themselves with joy; what kissing, 

congratulating, embracing, shaking of hands, and falling into all 

these raptures, over and over and over again; no language can 

describe.



At length, and after a long time, the old locksmith went up and 

fairly hugged two strangers, who had stood apart and left them to 

themselves; and then they saw--whom?  Yes, Edward Chester and 

Joseph Willet.



'See here!' cried the locksmith.  'See here! where would any of us 

have been without these two?  Oh, Mr Edward, Mr Edward--oh, Joe, 

Joe, how light, and yet how full, you have made my old heart to-

night!'



'It was Mr Edward that knocked him down, sir,' said Joe: 'I longed 

to do it, but I gave it up to him.  Come, you brave and honest 

gentleman!  Get your senses together, for you haven't long to lie 

here.'



He had his foot upon the breast of their sham deliverer, in the 

absence of a spare arm; and gave him a gentle roll as he spoke.  

Gashford, for it was no other, crouching yet malignant, raised his 

scowling face, like sin subdued, and pleaded to be gently used.



'I have access to all my lord's papers, Mr Haredale,' he said, in a 

submissive voice: Mr Haredale keeping his back towards him, and not 

once looking round: 'there are very important documents among them.  

There are a great many in secret drawers, and distributed in 

various places, known only to my lord and me.  I can give some very 

valuable information, and render important assistance to any 

inquiry.  You will have to answer it, if I receive ill usage.



'Pah!' cried Joe, in deep disgust.  'Get up, man; you're waited 

for, outside.  Get up, do you hear?'



Gashford slowly rose; and picking up his hat, and looking with a 

baffled malevolence, yet with an air of despicable humility, all 

round the room, crawled out.



'And now, gentlemen,' said Joe, who seemed to be the spokesman of 

the party, for all the rest were silent; 'the sooner we get back 

to the Black Lion, the better, perhaps.'



Mr Haredale nodded assent, and drawing his niece's arm through his, 

and taking one of her hands between his own, passed out 

straightway; followed by the locksmith, Mrs Varden, and Dolly--who 

would scarcely have presented a sufficient surface for all the hugs 

and caresses they bestowed upon her though she had been a dozen 

Dollys.  Edward Chester and Joe followed.



And did Dolly never once look behind--not once?  Was there not one 

little fleeting glimpse of the dark eyelash, almost resting on her 

flushed cheek, and of the downcast sparkling eye it shaded?  Joe 

thought there was--and he is not likely to have been mistaken; for 

there were not many eyes like Dolly's, that's the truth.



The outer room through which they had to pass, was full of men; 

among them, Mr Dennis in safe keeping; and there, had been since 

yesterday, lying in hiding behind a wooden screen which was now 

thrown down, Simon Tappertit, the recreant 'prentice, burnt and 

bruised, and with a gun-shot wound in his body; and his legs--his 

perfect legs, the pride and glory of his life, the comfort of his 

existence--crushed into shapeless ugliness.  Wondering no longer at 

the moans they had heard, Dolly kept closer to her father, and 

shuddered at the sight; but neither bruises, burns, nor gun-shot 

wound, nor all the torture of his shattered limbs, sent half so 

keen a pang to Simon's breast, as Dolly passing out, with Joe for 

her preserver.



A coach was ready at the door, and Dolly found herself safe and 

whole inside, between her father and mother, with Emma Haredale and 

her uncle, quite real, sitting opposite.  But there was no Joe, no 

Edward; and they had said nothing.  They had only bowed once, and 

kept at a distance.  Dear heart! what a long way it was to the 

Black Lion!
