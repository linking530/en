On that same night--events so crowd upon each other in convulsed 

and distracted times, that more than the stirring incidents of a 

whole life often become compressed into the compass of four-and-

twenty hours--on that same night, Mr Haredale, having strongly 

bound his prisoner, with the assistance of the sexton, and forced 

him to mount his horse, conducted him to Chigwell; bent upon 

procuring a conveyance to London from that place, and carrying him 

at once before a justice.  The disturbed state of the town would 

be, he knew, a sufficient reason for demanding the murderer's 

committal to prison before daybreak, as no man could answer for the 

security of any of the watch-houses or ordinary places of 

detention; and to convey a prisoner through the streets when the 

mob were again abroad, would not only be a task of great danger and 

hazard, but would be to challenge an attempt at rescue.  Directing 

the sexton to lead the horse, he walked close by the murderer's 

side, and in this order they reached the village about the middle 

of the night.



The people were all awake and up, for they were fearful of being 

burnt in their beds, and sought to comfort and assure each other by 

watching in company.  A few of the stoutest-hearted were armed and 

gathered in a body on the green.  To these, who knew him well, Mr 

Haredale addressed himself, briefly narrating what had happened, 

and beseeching them to aid in conveying the criminal to London 

before the dawn of day.



But not a man among them dared to help him by so much as the motion 

of a finger.  The rioters, in their passage through the village, 

had menaced with their fiercest vengeance, any person who should 

aid in extinguishing the fire, or render the least assistance to 

him, or any Catholic whomsoever.  Their threats extended to their 

lives and all they possessed.  They were assembled for their own 

protection, and could not endanger themselves by lending any aid to 

him.  This they told him, not without hesitation and regret, as 

they kept aloof in the moonlight and glanced fearfully at the 

ghostly rider, who, with his head drooping on his breast and his 

hat slouched down upon his brow, neither moved nor spoke.



Finding it impossible to persuade them, and indeed hardly knowing 

how to do so after what they had seen of the fury of the crowd, Mr 

Haredale besought them that at least they would leave him free to 

act for himself, and would suffer him to take the only chaise and 

pair of horses that the place afforded.  This was not acceded to 

without some difficulty, but in the end they told him to do what he 

would, and go away from them in heaven's name.



Leaving the sexton at the horse's bridle, he drew out the chaise 

with his own hands, and would have harnessed the horses, but that 

the post-boy of the village--a soft-hearted, good-for-nothing, 

vagabond kind of fellow--was moved by his earnestness and passion, 

and, throwing down a pitchfork with which he was armed, swore that 

the rioters might cut him into mincemeat if they liked, but he 

would not stand by and see an honest gentleman who had done no 

wrong, reduced to such extremity, without doing what he could to 

help him.  Mr Haredale shook him warmly by the hand, and thanked 

him from his heart.  In five minutes' time the chaise was ready, 

and this good scapegrace in his saddle.  The murderer was put 

inside, the blinds were drawn up, the sexton took his seat upon the 

bar, Mr Haredale mounted his horse and rode close beside the door; 

and so they started in the dead of night, and in profound silence, 

for London.



The consternation was so extreme that even the horses which had 

escaped the flames at the Warren, could find no friends to shelter 

them.  They passed them on the road, browsing on the stunted grass; 

and the driver told them, that the poor beasts had wandered to the 

village first, but had been driven away, lest they should bring 

the vengeance of the crowd on any of the inhabitants.



Nor was this feeling confined to such small places, where the 

people were timid, ignorant, and unprotected.  When they came near 

London they met, in the grey light of morning, more than one poor 

Catholic family who, terrified by the threats and warnings of 

their neighbours, were quitting the city on foot, and who told them 

they could hire no cart or horse for the removal of their goods, 

and had been compelled to leave them behind, at the mercy of the 

crowd.  Near Mile End they passed a house, the master of which, a 

Catholic gentleman of small means, having hired a waggon to remove 

his furniture by midnight, had had it all brought down into the 

street, to wait the vehicle's arrival, and save time in the 

packing.  But the man with whom he made the bargain, alarmed by the 

fires that night, and by the sight of the rioters passing his 

door, had refused to keep it: and the poor gentleman, with his wife 

and servant and their little children, were sitting trembling among 

their goods in the open street, dreading the arrival of day and not 

knowing where to turn or what to do.



It was the same, they heard, with the public conveyances.  The 

panic was so great that the mails and stage-coaches were afraid to 

carry passengers who professed the obnoxious religion.  If the 

drivers knew them, or they admitted that they held that creed, they 

would not take them, no, though they offered large sums; and 

yesterday, people had been afraid to recognise Catholic 

acquaintance in the streets, lest they should be marked by spies, 

and burnt out, as it was called, in consequence.  One mild old man--

a priest, whose chapel was destroyed; a very feeble, patient, 

inoffensive creature--who was trudging away, alone, designing to 

walk some distance from town, and then try his fortune with the 

coaches, told Mr Haredale that he feared he might not find a 

magistrate who would have the hardihood to commit a prisoner to 

jail, on his complaint.  But notwithstanding these discouraging 

accounts they went on, and reached the Mansion House soon after 

sunrise.



Mr Haredale threw himself from his horse, but he had no need to 

knock at the door, for it was already open, and there stood upon 

the step a portly old man, with a very red, or rather purple face, 

who with an anxious expression of countenance, was remonstrating 

with some unseen personage upstairs, while the porter essayed to 

close the door by degrees and get rid of him.  With the intense 

impatience and excitement natural to one in his condition, Mr 

Haredale thrust himself forward and was about to speak, when the 

fat old gentleman interposed:



'My good sir,' said he, 'pray let me get an answer.  This is the 

sixth time I have been here.  I was here five times yesterday.  My 

house is threatened with destruction.  It is to be burned down to-

night, and was to have been last night, but they had other business 

on their hands.  Pray let me get an answer.'



'My good sir,' returned Mr Haredale, shaking his head, 'my house 

is burned to the ground.  But heaven forbid that yours should be.  

Get your answer.  Be brief, in mercy to me.'



'Now, you hear this, my lord?'--said the old gentleman, calling up 

the stairs, to where the skirt of a dressing-gown fluttered on the 

landing-place.  'Here is a gentleman here, whose house was actually 

burnt down last night.'



'Dear me, dear me,' replied a testy voice, 'I am very sorry for 

it, but what am I to do?  I can't build it up again.  The chief 

magistrate of the city can't go and be a rebuilding of people's 

houses, my good sir.  Stuff and nonsense!'



'But the chief magistrate of the city can prevent people's houses 

from having any need to be rebuilt, if the chief magistrate's a 

man, and not a dummy--can't he, my lord?' cried the old gentleman 

in a choleric manner.



'You are disrespectable, sir,' said the Lord Mayor--'leastways, 

disrespectful I mean.'



'Disrespectful, my lord!' returned the old gentleman.  'I was 

respectful five times yesterday.  I can't be respectful for ever.  

Men can't stand on being respectful when their houses are going to 

be burnt over their heads, with them in 'em.  What am I to do, my 

lord?  AM I to have any protection!'



'I told you yesterday, sir,' said the Lord Mayor, 'that you might 

have an alderman in your house, if you could get one to come.'



'What the devil's the good of an alderman?' returned the choleric 

old gentleman.



'--To awe the crowd, sir,' said the Lord Mayor.



'Oh Lord ha' mercy!' whimpered the old gentleman, as he wiped his 

forehead in a state of ludicrous distress, 'to think of sending an 

alderman to awe a crowd!  Why, my lord, if they were even so many 

babies, fed on mother's milk, what do you think they'd care for an 

alderman!  Will YOU come?'



'I!' said the Lord Mayor, most emphatically: 'Certainly not.'



'Then what,' returned the old gentleman, 'what am I to do?  Am I a 

citizen of England?  Am I to have the benefit of the laws?  Am I to 

have any return for the King's taxes?'



'I don't know, I am sure,' said the Lord Mayor; 'what a pity it is 

you're a Catholic!  Why couldn't you be a Protestant, and then you 

wouldn't have got yourself into such a mess?  I'm sure I don't know 

what's to be done.--There are great people at the bottom of these 

riots.--Oh dear me, what a thing it is to be a public character!--

You must look in again in the course of the day.--Would a javelin-

man do?--Or there's Philips the constable,--HE'S disengaged,--he's 

not very old for a man at his time of life, except in his legs, and 

if you put him up at a window he'd look quite young by candle-

light, and might frighten 'em very much.--Oh dear!--well!--we'll 

see about it.'



'Stop!' cried Mr Haredale, pressing the door open as the porter 

strove to shut it, and speaking rapidly, 'My Lord Mayor, I beg you 

not to go away.  I have a man here, who committed a murder eight-

and-twenty years ago.  Half-a-dozen words from me, on oath, will 

justify you in committing him to prison for re-examination.  I only 

seek, just now, to have him consigned to a place of safety.  The 

least delay may involve his being rescued by the rioters.'



'Oh dear me!' cried the Lord Mayor.  'God bless my soul--and body--

oh Lor!--well I!--there are great people at the bottom of these 

riots, you know.--You really mustn't.'



'My lord,' said Mr Haredale, 'the murdered gentleman was my 

brother; I succeeded to his inheritance; there were not wanting 

slanderous tongues at that time, to whisper that the guilt of this 

most foul and cruel deed was mine--mine, who loved him, as he 

knows, in Heaven, dearly.  The time has come, after all these years 

of gloom and misery, for avenging him, and bringing to light a 

crime so artful and so devilish that it has no parallel.  Every 

second's delay on your part loosens this man's bloody hands again, 

and leads to his escape.  My lord, I charge you hear me, and 

despatch this matter on the instant.'



'Oh dear me!' cried the chief magistrate; 'these an't business 

hours, you know--I wonder at you--how ungentlemanly it is of you--

you mustn't--you really mustn't.--And I suppose you are a Catholic 

too?'



'I am,' said Mr Haredale.



'God bless my soul, I believe people turn Catholics a'purpose to 

vex and worrit me,' cried the Lord Mayor.  'I wish you wouldn't 

come here; they'll be setting the Mansion House afire next, and we 

shall have you to thank for it.  You must lock your prisoner up, 

sir--give him to a watchman--and--call again at a proper time.  

Then we'll see about it!'



Before Mr Haredale could answer, the sharp closing of a door and 

drawing of its bolts, gave notice that the Lord Mayor had retreated 

to his bedroom, and that further remonstrance would be unavailing.  

The two clients retreated likewise, and the porter shut them out 

into the street.



'That's the way he puts me off,' said the old gentleman, 'I can 

get no redress and no help.  What are you going to do, sir?'



'To try elsewhere,' answered Mr Haredale, who was by this time on 

horseback.



'I feel for you, I assure you--and well I may, for we are in a 

common cause,' said the old gentleman.  'I may not have a house to 

offer you to-night; let me tender it while I can.  On second 

thoughts though,' he added, putting up a pocket-book he had 

produced while speaking, 'I'll not give you a card, for if it was 

found upon you, it might get you into trouble.  Langdale--that's my 

name--vintner and distiller--Holborn Hill--you're heartily welcome, 

if you'll come.'



Mr Haredale bowed, and rode off, close beside the chaise as before; 

determining to repair to the house of Sir John Fielding, who had 

the reputation of being a bold and active magistrate, and fully 

resolved, in case the rioters should come upon them, to do 

execution on the murderer with his own hands, rather than suffer 

him to be released.



They arrived at the magistrate's dwelling, however, without 

molestation (for the mob, as we have seen, were then intent on 

deeper schemes), and knocked at the door.  As it had been pretty 

generally rumoured that Sir John was proscribed by the rioters, a 

body of thief-takers had been keeping watch in the house all night.  

To one of them Mr Haredale stated his business, which appearing to 

the man of sufficient moment to warrant his arousing the justice, 

procured him an immediate audience.



No time was lost in committing the murderer to Newgate; then a new 

building, recently completed at a vast expense, and considered to 

be of enormous strength.  The warrant being made out, three of the 

thief-takers bound him afresh (he had been struggling, it seemed, 

in the chaise, and had loosened his manacles); gagged him lest they 

should meet with any of the mob, and he should call to them for 

help; and seated themselves, along with him, in the carriage.  

These men being all well armed, made a formidable escort; but they 

drew up the blinds again, as though the carriage were empty, and 

directed Mr Haredale to ride forward, that he might not attract 

attention by seeming to belong to it.



The wisdom of this proceeding was sufficiently obvious, for as they 

hurried through the city they passed among several groups of men, 

who, if they had not supposed the chaise to be quite empty, would 

certainly have stopped it.  But those within keeping quite close, 

and the driver tarrying to be asked no questions, they reached the 

prison without interruption, and, once there, had him out, and safe 

within its gloomy walls, in a twinkling.



With eager eyes and strained attention, Mr Haredale saw him 

chained, and locked and barred up in his cell.  Nay, when he had 

left the jail, and stood in the free street, without, he felt the 

iron plates upon the doors, with his hands, and drew them over the 

stone wall, to assure himself that it was real; and to exult in its 

being so strong, and rough, and cold.  It was not until he turned 

his back upon the jail, and glanced along the empty streets, so 

lifeless and quiet in the bright morning, that he felt the weight 

upon his heart; that he knew he was tortured by anxiety for those 

he had left at home; and that home itself was but another bead in 

the long rosary of his regrets.
