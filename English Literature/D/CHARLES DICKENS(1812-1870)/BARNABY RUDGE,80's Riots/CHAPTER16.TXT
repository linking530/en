A series of pictures representing the streets of London in the 

night, even at the comparatively recent date of this tale, would 

present to the eye something so very different in character from 

the reality which is witnessed in these times, that it would be 

difficult for the beholder to recognise his most familiar walks in 

the altered aspect of little more than half a century ago.



They were, one and all, from the broadest and best to the narrowest 

and least frequented, very dark.  The oil and cotton lamps, though 

regularly trimmed twice or thrice in the long winter nights, burnt 

feebly at the best; and at a late hour, when they were unassisted 

by the lamps and candles in the shops, cast but a narrow track of 

doubtful light upon the footway, leaving the projecting doors and 

house-fronts in the deepest gloom.  Many of the courts and lanes 

were left in total darkness; those of the meaner sort, where one 

glimmering light twinkled for a score of houses, being favoured in 

no slight degree.  Even in these places, the inhabitants had often 

good reason for extinguishing their lamp as soon as it was lighted; 

and the watch being utterly inefficient and powerless to prevent 

them, they did so at their pleasure.  Thus, in the lightest 

thoroughfares, there was at every turn some obscure and dangerous 

spot whither a thief might fly or shelter, and few would care to 

follow; and the city being belted round by fields, green lanes, 

waste grounds, and lonely roads, dividing it at that time from the 

suburbs that have joined it since, escape, even where the pursuit 

was hot, was rendered easy.



It is no wonder that with these favouring circumstances in full and 

constant operation, street robberies, often accompanied by cruel 

wounds, and not unfrequently by loss of life, should have been of 

nightly occurrence in the very heart of London, or that quiet folks 

should have had great dread of traversing its streets after the 

shops were closed.  It was not unusual for those who wended home 

alone at midnight, to keep the middle of the road, the better to 

guard against surprise from lurking footpads; few would venture to 

repair at a late hour to Kentish Town or Hampstead, or even to 

Kensington or Chelsea, unarmed and unattended; while he who had 

been loudest and most valiant at the supper-table or the tavern, 

and had but a mile or so to go, was glad to fee a link-boy to 

escort him home.



There were many other characteristics--not quite so disagreeable--

about the thoroughfares of London then, with which they had been 

long familiar.  Some of the shops, especially those to the eastward 

of Temple Bar, still adhered to the old practice of hanging out a 

sign; and the creaking and swinging of these boards in their iron 

frames on windy nights, formed a strange and mournfal concert for 

the ears of those who lay awake in bed or hurried through the 

streets.  Long stands of hackney-chairs and groups of chairmen, 

compared with whom the coachmen of our day are gentle and polite, 

obstructed the way and filled the air with clamour; night-cellars, 

indicated by a little stream of light crossing the pavement, and 

stretching out half-way into the road, and by the stifled roar of 

voices from below, yawned for the reception and entertainment of 

the most abandoned of both sexes; under every shed and bulk small 

groups of link-boys gamed away the earnings of the day; or one more 

weary than the rest, gave way to sleep, and let the fragment of his 

torch fall hissing on the puddled ground.



Then there was the watch with staff and lantern crying the hour, 

and the kind of weather; and those who woke up at his voice and 

turned them round in bed, were glad to hear it rained, or snowed, 

or blew, or froze, for very comfort's sake.  The solitary passenger 

was startled by the chairmen's cry of 'By your leave there!' as two 

came trotting past him with their empty vehicle--carried backwards 

to show its being disengaged--and hurried to the nearest stand.  

Many a private chair, too, inclosing some fine lady, monstrously 

hooped and furbelowed, and preceded by running-footmen bearing 

flambeaux--for which extinguishers are yet suspended before the 

doors of a few houses of the better sort--made the way gay and 

light as it danced along, and darker and more dismal when it had 

passed.  It was not unusual for these running gentry, who carried 

it with a very high hand, to quarrel in the servants' hall while 

waiting for their masters and mistresses; and, falling to blows 

either there or in the street without, to strew the place of 

skirmish with hair-powder, fragments of bag-wigs, and scattered 

nosegays.  Gaming, the vice which ran so high among all classes 

(the fashion being of course set by the upper), was generally the 

cause of these disputes; for cards and dice were as openly used, 

and worked as much mischief, and yielded as much excitement below 

stairs, as above.  While incidents like these, arising out of drums 

and masquerades and parties at quadrille, were passing at the west 

end of the town, heavy stagecoaches and scarce heavier waggons were 

lumbering slowly towards the city, the coachmen, guard, and 

passengers, armed to the teeth, and the coach--a day or so perhaps 

behind its time, but that was nothing--despoiled by highwaymen; who 

made no scruple to attack, alone and single-handed, a whole caravan 

of goods and men, and sometimes shot a passenger or two, and were 

sometimes shot themselves, as the case might be.  On the morrow, 

rumours of this new act of daring on the road yielded matter for a 

few hours' conversation through the town, and a Public Progress of 

some fine gentleman (half-drunk) to Tyburn, dressed in the newest 

fashion, and damning the ordinary with unspeakable gallantry and 

grace, furnished to the populace, at once a pleasant excitement and 

a wholesome and profound example.



Among all the dangerous characters who, in such a state of society, 

prowled and skulked in the metropolis at night, there was one man 

from whom many as uncouth and fierce as he, shrunk with an 

involuntary dread.  Who he was, or whence he came, was a question 

often asked, but which none could answer.  His name was unknown, he 

had never been seen until within about eight days or thereabouts, 

and was equally a stranger to the old ruffians, upon whose haunts 

he ventured fearlessly, as to the young.  He could be no spy, for 

he never removed his slouched hat to look about him, entered into 

conversation with no man, heeded nothing that passed, listened to 

no discourse, regarded nobody that came or went.  But so surely as 

the dead of night set in, so surely this man was in the midst of 

the loose concourse in the night-cellar where outcasts of every 

grade resorted; and there he sat till morning.



He was not only a spectre at their licentious feasts; a something 

in the midst of their revelry and riot that chilled and haunted 

them; but out of doors he was the same.  Directly it was dark, he 

was abroad--never in company with any one, but always alone; never 

lingering or loitering, but always walking swiftly; and looking (so 

they said who had seen him) over his shoulder from time to time, 

and as he did so quickening his pace.  In the fields, the lanes, 

the roads, in all quarters of the town--east, west, north, and 

south--that man was seen gliding on like a shadow.  He was always 

hurrying away.  Those who encountered him, saw him steal past, 

caught sight of the backward glance, and so lost him in the 

darkness.



This constant restlessness, and flitting to and fro, gave rise to 

strange stories.  He was seen in such distant and remote places, at 

times so nearly tallying with each other, that some doubted whether 

there were not two of them, or more--some, whether he had not 

unearthly means of travelling from spot to spot.  The footpad 

hiding in a ditch had marked him passing like a ghost along its 

brink; the vagrant had met him on the dark high-road; the beggar 

had seen him pause upon the bridge to look down at the water, and 

then sweep on again; they who dealt in bodies with the surgeons 

could swear he slept in churchyards, and that they had beheld him 

glide away among the tombs on their approach.  And as they told 

these stories to each other, one who had looked about him would 

pull his neighbour by the sleeve, and there he would be among them.



At last, one man--he was one of those whose commerce lay among the 

graves--resolved to question this strange companion.  Next night, 

when he had eat his poor meal voraciously (he was accustomed to do 

that, they had observed, as though he had no other in the day), 

this fellow sat down at his elbow.



'A black night, master!'



'It is a black night.'



'Blacker than last, though that was pitchy too.  Didn't I pass you 

near the turnpike in the Oxford Road?'



'It's like you may.  I don't know.'



'Come, come, master,' cried the fellow, urged on by the looks of 

his comrades, and slapping him on the shoulder; 'be more 

companionable and communicative.  Be more the gentleman in this 

good company.  There are tales among us that you have sold yourself 

to the devil, and I know not what.'



'We all have, have we not?' returned the stranger, looking up.  'If 

we were fewer in number, perhaps he would give better wages.'



'It goes rather hard with you, indeed,' said the fellow, as the 

stranger disclosed his haggard unwashed face, and torn clothes.  

'What of that?  Be merry, master.  A stave of a roaring song now'--



'Sing you, if you desire to hear one,' replied the other, shaking 

him roughly off; 'and don't touch me if you're a prudent man; I 

carry arms which go off easily--they have done so, before now--and 

make it dangerous for strangers who don't know the trick of them, 

to lay hands upon me.'



'Do you threaten?' said the fellow.



'Yes,' returned the other, rising and turning upon him, and looking 

fiercely round as if in apprehension of a general attack.



His voice, and look, and bearing--all expressive of the wildest 

recklessness and desperation--daunted while they repelled the 

bystanders.  Although in a very different sphere of action now, 

they were not without much of the effect they had wrought at the 

Maypole Inn.



'I am what you all are, and live as you all do,' said the man 

sternly, after a short silence.  'I am in hiding here like the 

rest, and if we were surprised would perhaps do my part with the 

best of ye.  If it's my humour to be left to myself, let me have 

it.  Otherwise,'--and here he swore a tremendous oath--'there'll be 

mischief done in this place, though there ARE odds of a score 

against me.'



A low murmur, having its origin perhaps in a dread of the man and 

the mystery that surrounded him, or perhaps in a sincere opinion on 

the part of some of those present, that it would be an inconvenient 

precedent to meddle too curiously with a gentleman's private 

affairs if he saw reason to conceal them, warned the fellow who 

had occasioned this discussion that he had best pursue it no 

further.  After a short time the strange man lay down upon a bench 

to sleep, and when they thought of him again, they found he was 

gone.



Next night, as soon as it was dark, he was abroad again and 

traversing the streets; he was before the locksmith's house more 

than once, but the family were out, and it was close shut.  This 

night he crossed London Bridge and passed into Southwark.  As he 

glided down a bye street, a woman with a little basket on her arm, 

turned into it at the other end.  Directly he observed her, he 

sought the shelter of an archway, and stood aside until she had 

passed.  Then he emerged cautiously from his hiding-place, and 

followed.



She went into several shops to purchase various kinds of household 

necessaries, and round every place at which she stopped he hovered 

like her evil spirit; following her when she reappeared.  It was 

nigh eleven o'clock, and the passengers in the streets were 

thinning fast, when she turned, doubtless to go home.  The phantom 

still followed her.



She turned into the same bye street in which he had seen her first, 

which, being free from shops, and narrow, was extremely dark.  She 

quickened her pace here, as though distrustful of being stopped, 

and robbed of such trifling property as she carried with her.  He 

crept along on the other side of the road.  Had she been gifted 

with the speed of wind, it seemed as if his terrible shadow would 

have tracked her down.



At length the widow--for she it was--reached her own door, and, 

panting for breath, paused to take the key from her basket.  In a 

flush and glow, with the haste she had made, and the pleasure of 

being safe at home, she stooped to draw it out, when, raising her 

head, she saw him standing silently beside her: the apparition of 

a dream.



His hand was on her mouth, but that was needless, for her tongue 

clove to its roof, and her power of utterance was gone.  'I have 

been looking for you many nights.  Is the house empty?  Answer me.  

Is any one inside?'



She could only answer by a rattle in her throat.



'Make me a sign.'



She seemed to indicate that there was no one there.  He took the 

key, unlocked the door, carried her in, and secured it carefully 

behind them.
