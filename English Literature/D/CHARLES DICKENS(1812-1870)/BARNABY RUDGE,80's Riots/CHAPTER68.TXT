While Newgate was burning on the previous night, Barnaby and his 

father, having been passed among the crowd from hand to hand, stood 

in Smithfield, on the outskirts of the mob, gazing at the flames 

like men who had been suddenly roused from sleep.  Some moments 

elapsed before they could distinctly remember where they were, or 

how they got there; or recollected that while they were standing 

idle and listless spectators of the fire, they had tools in their 

hands which had been hurriedly given them that they might free 

themselves from their fetters.



Barnaby, heavily ironed as he was, if he had obeyed his first 

impulse, or if he had been alone, would have made his way back to 

the side of Hugh, who to his clouded intellect now shone forth with 

the new lustre of being his preserver and truest friend.  But his 

father's terror of remaining in the streets, communicated itself to 

him when he comprehended the full extent of his fears, and 

impressed him with the same eagerness to fly to a place of safety.



In a corner of the market among the pens for cattle, Barnaby knelt 

down, and pausing every now and then to pass his hand over his 

father's face, or look up to him with a smile, knocked off his 

irons.  When he had seen him spring, a free man, to his feet, and 

had given vent to the transport of delight which the sight 

awakened, he went to work upon his own, which soon fell rattling 

down upon the ground, and left his limbs unfettered.



Gliding away together when this task was accomplished, and passing 

several groups of men, each gathered round a stooping figure to 

hide him from those who passed, but unable to repress the clanking 

sound of hammers, which told that they too were busy at the same 

work,--the two fugitives made towards Clerkenwell, and passing 

thence to Islington, as the nearest point of egress, were quickly 

in the fields.  After wandering about for a long time, they found 

in a pasture near Finchley a poor shed, with walls of mud, and roof 

of grass and brambles, built for some cowherd, but now deserted.  

Here, they lay down for the rest of the night.



They wandered to and fro when it was day, and once Barnaby went off 

alone to a cluster of little cottages two or three miles away, to 

purchase some bread and milk.  But finding no better shelter, they 

returned to the same place, and lay down again to wait for night.



Heaven alone can tell, with what vague hopes of duty, and 

affection; with what strange promptings of nature, intelligible to 

him as to a man of radiant mind and most enlarged capacity; with 

what dim memories of children he had played with when a child 

himself, who had prattled of their fathers, and of loving them, and 

being loved; with how many half-remembered, dreamy associations of 

his mother's grief and tears and widowhood; he watched and tended 

this man.  But that a vague and shadowy crowd of such ideas came 

slowly on him; that they taught him to be sorry when he looked upon 

his haggard face, that they overflowed his eyes when he stooped to 

kiss him, that they kept him waking in a tearful gladness, shading 

him from the sun, fanning him with leaves, soothing him when he 

started in his sleep--ah! what a troubled sleep it was--and 

wondering when SHE would come to join them and be happy, is the 

truth.  He sat beside him all that day; listening for her footsteps 

in every breath of air, looking for her shadow on the gently-waving 

grass, twining the hedge flowers for her pleasure when she came, 

and his when he awoke; and stooping down from time to time to 

listen to his mutterings, and wonder why he was so restless in that 

quiet place.  The sun went down, and night came on, and he was 

still quite tranquil; busied with these thoughts, as if there were 

no other people in the world, and the dull cloud of smoke hanging 

on the immense city in the distance, hid no vices, no crimes, no 

life or death, or cause of disquiet--nothing but clear air.



But the hour had now come when he must go alone to find out the 

blind man (a task that filled him with delight) and bring him to 

that place; taking especial care that he was not watched or 

followed on his way back.  He listened to the directions he must 

observe, repeated them again and again, and after twice or thrice 

returning to surprise his father with a light-hearted laugh, went 

forth, at last, upon his errand: leaving Grip, whom he had carried 

from the jail in his arms, to his care.



Fleet of foot, and anxious to return, he sped swiftly on towards 

the city, but could not reach it before the fires began, and made 

the night angry with their dismal lustre.  When he entered the 

town--it might be that he was changed by going there without his 

late companions, and on no violent errand; or by the beautiful 

solitude in which he had passed the day, or by the thoughts that 

had come upon him,--but it seemed peopled by a legion of devils.  

This flight and pursuit, this cruel burning and destroying, these 

dreadful cries and stunning noises, were THEY the good lord's noble 

cause!



Though almost stupefied by the bewildering scene, still be found 

the blind man's house.  It was shut up and tenantless.



He waited for a long while, but no one came.  At last he withdrew; 

and as he knew by this time that the soldiers were firing, and many 

people must have been killed, he went down into Holborn, where he 

heard the great crowd was, to try if he could find Hugh, and 

persuade him to avoid the danger, and return with him.



If he had been stunned and shocked before, his horror was 

increased a thousandfold when he got into this vortex of the riot, 

and not being an actor in the terrible spectacle, had it all before 

his eyes.  But there, in the midst, towering above them all, close 

before the house they were attacking now, was Hugh on horseback, 

calling to the rest!



Sickened by the sights surrounding him on every side, and by the 

heat and roar, and crash, he forced his way among the crowd (where 

many recognised him, and with shouts pressed back to let him pass), 

and in time was nearly up with Hugh, who was savagely threatening 

some one, but whom or what he said, he could not, in the great 

confusion, understand.  At that moment the crowd forced their way 

into the house, and Hugh--it was impossible to see by what means, 

in such a concourse--fell headlong down.



Barnaby was beside him when he staggered to his feet.  It was well 

he made him hear his voice, or Hugh, with his uplifted axe, would 

have cleft his skull in twain.



'Barnaby--you!  Whose hand was that, that struck me down?'



'Not mine.'



'Whose!--I say, whose!' he cried, reeling back, and looking wildly 

round.  'What are you doing?  Where is he?  Show me!'



'You are hurt,' said Barnaby--as indeed he was, in the head, both 

by the blow he had received, and by his horse's hoof.  'Come away 

with me.'



As he spoke, he took the horse's bridle in his hand, turned him, 

and dragged Hugh several paces.  This brought them out of the 

crowd, which was pouring from the street into the vintner's 

cellars.



'Where's--where's Dennis?' said Hugh, coming to a stop, and 

checking Barnaby with his strong arm.  'Where has he been all day?  

What did he mean by leaving me as he did, in the jail, last night?  

Tell me, you--d'ye hear!'



With a flourish of his dangerous weapon, he fell down upon the 

ground like a log.  After a minute, though already frantic with 

drinking and with the wound in his head, he crawled to a stream of 

burning spirit which was pouring down the kennel, and began to 

drink at it as if it were a brook of water.



Barnaby drew him away, and forced him to rise.  Though he could 

neither stand nor walk, he involuntarily staggered to his horse, 

climbed upon his back, and clung there.  After vainly attempting to 

divest the animal of his clanking trappings, Barnaby sprung up 

behind him, snatched the bridle, turned into Leather Lane, which 

was close at hand, and urged the frightened horse into a heavy 

trot.



He looked back, once, before he left the street; and looked upon a 

sight not easily to be erased, even from his remembrance, so long 

as he had life.



The vintner's house with a half-a-dozen others near at hand, was 

one great, glowing blaze.  All night, no one had essayed to quench 

the flames, or stop their progress; but now a body of soldiers 

were actively engaged in pulling down two old wooden houses, which 

were every moment in danger of taking fire, and which could 

scarcely fail, if they were left to burn, to extend the 

conflagration immensely.  The tumbling down of nodding walls and 

heavy blocks of wood, the hooting and the execrations of the crowd, 

the distant firing of other military detachments, the distracted 

looks and cries of those whose habitations were in danger, the 

hurrying to and fro of frightened people with their goods; the 

reflections in every quarter of the sky, of deep, red, soaring 

flames, as though the last day had come and the whole universe were 

burning; the dust, and smoke, and drift of fiery particles, 

scorching and kindling all it fell upon; the hot unwholesome 

vapour, the blight on everything; the stars, and moon, and very 

sky, obliterated;--made up such a sum of dreariness and ruin, that 

it seemed as if the face of Heaven were blotted out, and night, in 

its rest and quiet, and softened light, never could look upon the 

earth again.



But there was a worse spectacle than this--worse by far than fire 

and smoke, or even the rabble's unappeasable and maniac rage.  The 

gutters of the street, and every crack and fissure in the stones, 

ran with scorching spirit, which being dammed up by busy hands, 

overflowed the road and pavement, and formed a great pool, into 

which the people dropped down dead by dozens.  They lay in heaps 

all round this fearful pond, husbands and wives, fathers and sons, 

mothers and daughters, women with children in their arms and babies 

at their breasts, and drank until they died.  While some stooped 

with their lips to the brink and never raised their heads again, 

others sprang up from their fiery draught, and danced, half in a 

mad triumph, and half in the agony of suffocation, until they fell, 

and steeped their corpses in the liquor that had killed them.  Nor 

was even this the worst or most appalling kind of death that 

happened on this fatal night.  From the burning cellars, where they 

drank out of hats, pails, buckets, tubs, and shoes, some men were 

drawn, alive, but all alight from head to foot; who, in their 

unendurable anguish and suffering, making for anything that had the 

look of water, rolled, hissing, in this hideous lake, and splashed 

up liquid fire which lapped in all it met with as it ran along the 

surface, and neither spared the living nor the dead.  On this last 

night of the great riots--for the last night it was--the wretched 

victims of a senseless outcry, became themselves the dust and ashes 

of the flames they had kindled, and strewed the public streets of 

London.



With all he saw in this last glance fixed indelibly upon his mind, 

Barnaby hurried from the city which enclosed such horrors; and 

holding down his head that he might not even see the glare of the 

fires upon the quiet landscape, was soon in the still country 

roads.



He stopped at about half-a-mile from the shed where his father 

lay, and with some difficulty making Hugh sensible that he must 

dismount, sunk the horse's furniture in a pool of stagnant water, 

and turned the animal loose.  That done, he supported his companion 

as well as he could, and led him slowly forward.
