JOHN JASPER, on his way home through the Close, is brought to a 

stand-still by the spectacle of Stony Durdles, dinner-bundle and 

all, leaning his back against the iron railing of the burial-ground 

enclosing it from the old cloister-arches; and a hideous small boy 

in rags flinging stones at him as a well-defined mark in the 

moonlight.  Sometimes the stones hit him, and sometimes they miss 

him, but Durdles seems indifferent to either fortune.  The hideous 

small boy, on the contrary, whenever he hits Durdles, blows a 

whistle of triumph through a jagged gap, convenient for the 

purpose, in the front of his mouth, where half his teeth are 

wanting; and whenever he misses him, yelps out 'Mulled agin!' and 

tries to atone for the failure by taking a more correct and vicious 

aim.



'What are you doing to the man?' demands Jasper, stepping out into 

the moonlight from the shade.



'Making a cock-shy of him,' replies the hideous small boy.



'Give me those stones in your hand.'



'Yes, I'll give 'em you down your throat, if you come a-ketching 

hold of me,' says the small boy, shaking himself loose, and 

backing.  'I'll smash your eye, if you don't look out!'



'Baby-Devil that you are, what has the man done to you?'



'He won't go home.'



'What is that to you?'



'He gives me a 'apenny to pelt him home if I ketches him out too 

late,' says the boy.  And then chants, like a little savage, half 

stumbling and half dancing among the rags and laces of his 

dilapidated boots:-





'Widdy widdy wen!

I - ket - ches - Im - out - ar - ter - ten,

Widdy widdy wy!

Then - E - don't - go - then - I - shy -

Widdy Widdy Wake-cock warning!'





- with a comprehensive sweep on the last word, and one more 

delivery at Durdles.



This would seem to be a poetical note of preparation, agreed upon, 

as a caution to Durdles to stand clear if he can, or to betake 

himself homeward.



John Jasper invites the boy with a beck of his head to follow him 

(feeling it hopeless to drag him, or coax him), and crosses to the 

iron railing where the Stony (and stoned) One is profoundly 

meditating.



'Do you know this thing, this child?' asks Jasper, at a loss for a 

word that will define this thing.



'Deputy,' says Durdles, with a nod.



'Is that its - his - name?'



'Deputy,' assents Durdles.



'I'm man-servant up at the Travellers' Twopenny in Gas Works 

Garding,' this thing explains.  'All us man-servants at Travellers' 

Lodgings is named Deputy.  When we're chock full and the Travellers 

is all a-bed I come out for my 'elth.'  Then withdrawing into the 

road, and taking aim, he resumes:-





'Widdy widdy wen!

I - ket - ches - Im - out - ar - ter - '





'Hold your hand,' cries Jasper, 'and don't throw while I stand so 

near him, or I'll kill you!  Come, Durdles; let me walk home with 

you to-night.  Shall I carry your bundle?'



'Not on any account,' replies Durdles, adjusting it.  'Durdles was 

making his reflections here when you come up, sir, surrounded by 

his works, like a poplar Author. - Your own brother-in-law;' 

introducing a sarcophagus within the railing, white and cold in the 

moonlight.  'Mrs. Sapsea;' introducing the monument of that devoted 

wife.  'Late Incumbent;' introducing the Reverend Gentleman's 

broken column.  'Departed Assessed Taxes;' introducing a vase and 

towel, standing on what might represent the cake of soap.  'Former 

pastrycook and Muffin-maker, much respected;' introducing 

gravestone.  'All safe and sound here, sir, and all Durdles's work.  

Of the common folk, that is merely bundled up in turf and brambles, 

the less said the better.  A poor lot, soon forgot.'



'This creature, Deputy, is behind us,' says Jasper, looking back.  

'Is he to follow us?'



The relations between Durdles and Deputy are of a capricious kind; 

for, on Durdles's turning himself about with the slow gravity of 

beery suddenness, Deputy makes a pretty wide circuit into the road 

and stands on the defensive.



'You never cried Widdy Warning before you begun to-night,' says 

Durdles, unexpectedly reminded of, or imagining, an injury.



'Yer lie, I did,' says Deputy, in his only form of polite 

contradiction.



'Own brother, sir,' observes Durdles, turning himself about again, 

and as unexpectedly forgetting his offence as he had recalled or 

conceived it; 'own brother to Peter the Wild Boy!  But I gave him 

an object in life.'



'At which he takes aim?' Mr. Jasper suggests.



'That's it, sir,' returns Durdles, quite satisfied; 'at which he 

takes aim.  I took him in hand and gave him an object.  What was he 

before?  A destroyer.  What work did he do?  Nothing but 

destruction.  What did he earn by it?  Short terms in Cloisterham 

jail.  Not a person, not a piece of property, not a winder, not a 

horse, nor a dog, nor a cat, nor a bird, nor a fowl, nor a pig, but 

what he stoned, for want of an enlightened object.  I put that 

enlightened object before him, and now he can turn his honest 

halfpenny by the three penn'orth a week.'



'I wonder he has no competitors.'



'He has plenty, Mr. Jasper, but he stones 'em all away.  Now, I 

don't know what this scheme of mine comes to,' pursues Durdles, 

considering about it with the same sodden gravity; 'I don't know 

what you may precisely call it.  It ain't a sort of a - scheme of a 

- National Education?'



'I should say not,' replies Jasper.



'I should say not,' assents Durdles; 'then we won't try to give it 

a name.'



'He still keeps behind us,' repeats Jasper, looking over his 

shoulder; 'is he to follow us?'



'We can't help going round by the Travellers' Twopenny, if we go 

the short way, which is the back way,' Durdles answers, 'and we'll 

drop him there.'



So they go on; Deputy, as a rear rank one, taking open order, and 

invading the silence of the hour and place by stoning every wall, 

post, pillar, and other inanimate object, by the deserted way.



'Is there anything new down in the crypt, Durdles?' asks John 

Jasper.



'Anything old, I think you mean,' growls Durdles.  'It ain't a spot 

for novelty.'



'Any new discovery on your part, I meant.'



'There's a old 'un under the seventh pillar on the left as you go 

down the broken steps of the little underground chapel as formerly 

was; I make him out (so fur as I've made him out yet) to be one of 

them old 'uns with a crook.  To judge from the size of the passages 

in the walls, and of the steps and doors, by which they come and 

went, them crooks must have been a good deal in the way of the old 

'uns!  Two on 'em meeting promiscuous must have hitched one another 

by the mitre pretty often, I should say.'



Without any endeavour to correct the literality of this opinion, 

Jasper surveys his companion - covered from head to foot with old 

mortar, lime, and stone grit - as though he, Jasper, were getting 

imbued with a romantic interest in his weird life.



'Yours is a curious existence.'



Without furnishing the least clue to the question, whether he 

receives this as a compliment or as quite the reverse, Durdles 

gruffly answers:  'Yours is another.'



'Well! inasmuch as my lot is cast in the same old earthy, chilly, 

never-changing place, Yes.  But there is much more mystery and 

interest in your connection with the Cathedral than in mine.  

Indeed, I am beginning to have some idea of asking you to take me 

on as a sort of student, or free 'prentice, under you, and to let 

me go about with you sometimes, and see some of these odd nooks in 

which you pass your days.'



The Stony One replies, in a general way, 'All right.  Everybody 

knows where to find Durdles, when he's wanted.'  Which, if not 

strictly true, is approximately so, if taken to express that 

Durdles may always be found in a state of vagabondage somewhere.



'What I dwell upon most,' says Jasper, pursuing his subject of 

romantic interest, 'is the remarkable accuracy with which you would 

seem to find out where people are buried. - What is the matter?  

That bundle is in your way; let me hold it.'



Durdles has stopped and backed a little (Deputy, attentive to all 

his movements, immediately skirmishing into the road), and was 

looking about for some ledge or corner to place his bundle on, when 

thus relieved of it.



'Just you give me my hammer out of that,' says Durdles, 'and I'll 

show you.'



Clink, clink.  And his hammer is handed him.



'Now, lookee here.  You pitch your note, don't you, Mr. Jasper?'



'Yes.'



'So I sound for mine.  I take my hammer, and I tap.'  (Here he 

strikes the pavement, and the attentive Deputy skirmishes at a 

rather wider range, as supposing that his head may be in 

requisition.)  'I tap, tap, tap.  Solid!  I go on tapping.  Solid 

still!  Tap again.  Holloa!  Hollow!  Tap again, persevering.  

Solid in hollow!  Tap, tap, tap, to try it better.  Solid in 

hollow; and inside solid, hollow again!  There you are!  Old 'un 

crumbled away in stone coffin, in vault!'



'Astonishing!'



'I have even done this,' says Durdles, drawing out his two-foot 

rule (Deputy meanwhile skirmishing nearer, as suspecting that 

Treasure may be about to be discovered, which may somehow lead to 

his own enrichment, and the delicious treat of the discoverers 

being hanged by the neck, on his evidence, until they are dead).  

'Say that hammer of mine's a wall - my work.  Two; four; and two is 

six,' measuring on the pavement.  'Six foot inside that wall is 

Mrs. Sapsea.'



'Not really Mrs. Sapsea?'



'Say Mrs. Sapsea.  Her wall's thicker, but say Mrs. Sapsea.  

Durdles taps, that wall represented by that hammer, and says, after 

good sounding:  "Something betwixt us!"  Sure enough, some rubbish 

has been left in that same six-foot space by Durdles's men!'



Jasper opines that such accuracy 'is a gift.'



'I wouldn't have it at a gift,' returns Durdles, by no means 

receiving the observation in good part.  'I worked it out for 

myself.  Durdles comes by HIS knowledge through grubbing deep for 

it, and having it up by the roots when it don't want to come. - 

Holloa you Deputy!'



'Widdy!' is Deputy's shrill response, standing off again.



'Catch that ha'penny.  And don't let me see any more of you to-

night, after we come to the Travellers' Twopenny.'



'Warning!' returns Deputy, having caught the halfpenny, and 

appearing by this mystic word to express his assent to the 

arrangement.



They have but to cross what was once the vineyard, belonging to 

what was once the Monastery, to come into the narrow back lane 

wherein stands the crazy wooden house of two low stories currently 

known as the Travellers' Twopenny:- a house all warped and 

distorted, like the morals of the travellers, with scant remains of 

a lattice-work porch over the door, and also of a rustic fence 

before its stamped-out garden; by reason of the travellers being so 

bound to the premises by a tender sentiment (or so fond of having a 

fire by the roadside in the course of the day), that they can never 

be persuaded or threatened into departure, without violently 

possessing themselves of some wooden forget-me-not, and bearing it 

off.



The semblance of an inn is attempted to be given to this wretched 

place by fragments of conventional red curtaining in the windows, 

which rags are made muddily transparent in the night-season by 

feeble lights of rush or cotton dip burning dully in the close air 

of the inside.  As Durdles and Jasper come near, they are addressed 

by an inscribed paper lantern over the door, setting forth the 

purport of the house.  They are also addressed by some half-dozen 

other hideous small boys - whether twopenny lodgers or followers or 

hangers-on of such, who knows! - who, as if attracted by some 

carrion-scent of Deputy in the air, start into the moonlight, as 

vultures might gather in the desert, and instantly fall to stoning 

him and one another.



'Stop, you young brutes,' cries Jasper angrily, 'and let us go by!'



This remonstrance being received with yells and flying stones, 

according to a custom of late years comfortably established among 

the police regulations of our English communities, where Christians 

are stoned on all sides, as if the days of Saint Stephen were 

revived, Durdles remarks of the young savages, with some point, 

that 'they haven't got an object,' and leads the way down the lane.



At the corner of the lane, Jasper, hotly enraged, checks his 

companion and looks back.  All is silent.  Next moment, a stone 

coming rattling at his hat, and a distant yell of 'Wake-Cock!  

Warning!' followed by a crow, as from some infernally-hatched 

Chanticleer, apprising him under whose victorious fire he stands, 

he turns the corner into safety, and takes Durdles home:  Durdles 

stumbling among the litter of his stony yard as if he were going to 

turn head foremost into one of the unfinished tombs.



John Jasper returns by another way to his gatehouse, and entering 

softly with his key, finds his fire still burning.  He takes from a 

locked press a peculiar-looking pipe, which he fills - but not with 

tobacco - and, having adjusted the contents of the bowl, very 

carefully, with a little instrument, ascends an inner staircase of 

only a few steps, leading to two rooms.  One of these is his own 

sleeping chamber:  the other is his nephew's.  There is a light in 

each.



His nephew lies asleep, calm and untroubled.  John Jasper stands 

looking down upon him, his unlighted pipe in his hand, for some 

time, with a fixed and deep attention.  Then, hushing his 

footsteps, he passes to his own room, lights his pipe, and delivers 

himself to the Spectres it invokes at midnight.
