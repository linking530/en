THE Reverend Septimus Crisparkle (Septimus, because six little 

brother Crisparkles before him went out, one by one, as they were 

born, like six weak little rushlights, as they were lighted), 

having broken the thin morning ice near Cloisterham Weir with his 

amiable head, much to the invigoration of his frame, was now 

assisting his circulation by boxing at a looking-glass with great 

science and prowess.  A fresh and healthy portrait the looking-

glass presented of the Reverend Septimus, feinting and dodging with 

the utmost artfulness, and hitting out from the shoulder with the 

utmost straightness, while his radiant features teemed with 

innocence, and soft-hearted benevolence beamed from his boxing-

gloves.



It was scarcely breakfast-time yet, for Mrs. Crisparkle - mother, 

not wife of the Reverend Septimus - was only just down, and waiting 

for the urn.  Indeed, the Reverend Septimus left off at this very 

moment to take the pretty old lady's entering face between his 

boxing-gloves and kiss it.  Having done so with tenderness, the 

Reverend Septimus turned to again, countering with his left, and 

putting in his right, in a tremendous manner.



'I say, every morning of my life, that you'll do it at last, Sept,' 

remarked the old lady, looking on; 'and so you will.'



'Do what, Ma dear?'



'Break the pier-glass, or burst a blood-vessel.'



'Neither, please God, Ma dear.  Here's wind, Ma.  Look at this!'  

In a concluding round of great severity, the Reverend Septimus 

administered and escaped all sorts of punishment, and wound up by 

getting the old lady's cap into Chancery - such is the technical 

term used in scientific circles by the learned in the Noble Art - 

with a lightness of touch that hardly stirred the lightest lavender 

or cherry riband on it.  Magnanimously releasing the defeated, just 

in time to get his gloves into a drawer and feign to be looking out 

of window in a contemplative state of mind when a servant entered, 

the Reverend Septimus then gave place to the urn and other 

preparations for breakfast.  These completed, and the two alone 

again, it was pleasant to see (or would have been, if there had 

been any one to see it, which there never was), the old lady 

standing to say the Lord's Prayer aloud, and her son, Minor Canon 

nevertheless, standing with bent head to hear it, he being within 

five years of forty:  much as he had stood to hear the same words 

from the same lips when he was within five months of four.



What is prettier than an old lady - except a young lady - when her 

eyes are bright, when her figure is trim and compact, when her face 

is cheerful and calm, when her dress is as the dress of a china 

shepherdess:  so dainty in its colours, so individually assorted to 

herself, so neatly moulded on her?  Nothing is prettier, thought 

the good Minor Canon frequently, when taking his seat at table 

opposite his long-widowed mother.  Her thought at such times may be 

condensed into the two words that oftenest did duty together in all 

her conversations:  'My Sept!'



They were a good pair to sit breakfasting together in Minor Canon 

Corner, Cloisterham.  For Minor Canon Corner was a quiet place in 

the shadow of the Cathedral, which the cawing of the rooks, the 

echoing footsteps of rare passers, the sound of the Cathedral bell, 

or the roll of the Cathedral organ, seemed to render more quiet 

than absolute silence.  Swaggering fighting men had had their 

centuries of ramping and raving about Minor Canon Corner, and 

beaten serfs had had their centuries of drudging and dying there, 

and powerful monks had had their centuries of being sometimes 

useful and sometimes harmful there, and behold they were all gone 

out of Minor Canon Corner, and so much the better.  Perhaps one of 

the highest uses of their ever having been there, was, that there 

might be left behind, that blessed air of tranquillity which 

pervaded Minor Canon Corner, and that serenely romantic state of 

the mind - productive for the most part of pity and forbearance - 

which is engendered by a sorrowful story that is all told, or a 

pathetic play that is played out.



Red-brick walls harmoniously toned down in colour by time, strong-

rooted ivy, latticed windows, panelled rooms, big oaken beams in 

little places, and stone-walled gardens where annual fruit yet 

ripened upon monkish trees, were the principal surroundings of 

pretty old Mrs. Crisparkle and the Reverend Septimus as they sat at 

breakfast.



'And what, Ma dear,' inquired the Minor Canon, giving proof of a 

wholesome and vigorous appetite, 'does the letter say?'



The pretty old lady, after reading it, had just laid it down upon 

the breakfast-cloth.  She handed it over to her son.



Now, the old lady was exceedingly proud of her bright eyes being so 

clear that she could read writing without spectacles.  Her son was 

also so proud of the circumstance, and so dutifully bent on her 

deriving the utmost possible gratification from it, that he had 

invented the pretence that he himself could NOT read writing 

without spectacles.  Therefore he now assumed a pair, of grave and 

prodigious proportions, which not only seriously inconvenienced his 

nose and his breakfast, but seriously impeded his perusal of the 

letter.  For, he had the eyes of a microscope and a telescope 

combined, when they were unassisted.



'It's from Mr. Honeythunder, of course,' said the old lady, folding 

her arms.



'Of course,' assented her son.  He then lamely read on:



'"Haven of Philanthropy,

Chief Offices, London, Wednesday.



'"DEAR MADAM,



'"I write in the - ;"  In the what's this?  What does he write in?'



'In the chair,' said the old lady.



The Reverend Septimus took off his spectacles, that he might see 

her face, as he exclaimed:



'Why, what should he write in?'



'Bless me, bless me, Sept,' returned the old lady, 'you don't see 

the context!  Give it back to me, my dear.'



Glad to get his spectacles off (for they always made his eyes 

water), her son obeyed:  murmuring that his sight for reading 

manuscript got worse and worse daily.



'"I write,"' his mother went on, reading very perspicuously and 

precisely, '"from the chair, to which I shall probably be confined 

for some hours."'



Septimus looked at the row of chairs against the wall, with a half-

protesting and half-appealing countenance.



'"We have,"' the old lady read on with a little extra emphasis, '"a 

meeting of our Convened Chief Composite Committee of Central and 

District Philanthropists, at our Head Haven as above; and it is 

their unanimous pleasure that I take the chair."'



Septimus breathed more freely, and muttered:  'O! if he comes to 

THAT, let him,'



'"Not to lose a day's post, I take the opportunity of a long report 

being read, denouncing a public miscreant - "'



'It is a most extraordinary thing,' interposed the gentle Minor 

Canon, laying down his knife and fork to rub his ear in a vexed 

manner, 'that these Philanthropists are always denouncing somebody.  

And it is another most extraordinary thing that they are always so 

violently flush of miscreants!'



'"Denouncing a public miscreant - "' - the old lady resumed, '"to 

get our little affair of business off my mind.  I have spoken with 

my two wards, Neville and Helena Landless, on the subject of their 

defective education, and they give in to the plan proposed; as I 

should have taken good care they did, whether they liked it or 

not."'



'And it is another most extraordinary thing,' remarked the Minor 

Canon in the same tone as before, 'that these philanthropists are 

so given to seizing their fellow-creatures by the scruff of the 

neck, and (as one may say) bumping them into the paths of peace. - 

I beg your pardon, Ma dear, for interrupting.'



'"Therefore, dear Madam, you will please prepare your son, the Rev. 

Mr. Septimus, to expect Neville as an inmate to be read with, on 

Monday next.  On the same day Helena will accompany him to 

Cloisterham, to take up her quarters at the Nuns' House, the 

establishment recommended by yourself and son jointly.  Please 

likewise to prepare for her reception and tuition there.  The terms 

in both cases are understood to be exactly as stated to me in 

writing by yourself, when I opened a correspondence with you on 

this subject, after the honour of being introduced to you at your 

sister's house in town here.  With compliments to the Rev.  Mr. 

Septimus, I am, Dear Madam, Your affectionate brother (In 

Philanthropy), LUKE HONEYTHUNDER."'



'Well, Ma,' said Septimus, after a little more rubbing of his ear, 

'we must try it.  There can be no doubt that we have room for an 

inmate, and that I have time to bestow upon him, and inclination 

too.  I must confess to feeling rather glad that he is not Mr. 

Honeythunder himself.  Though that seems wretchedly prejudiced - 

does it not? - for I never saw him.  Is he a large man, Ma?'



'I should call him a large man, my dear,' the old lady replied 

after some hesitation, 'but that his voice is so much larger.'



'Than himself?'



'Than anybody.'



'Hah!' said Septimus.  And finished his breakfast as if the flavour 

of the Superior Family Souchong, and also of the ham and toast and 

eggs, were a little on the wane.



Mrs. Crisparkle's sister, another piece of Dresden china, and 

matching her so neatly that they would have made a delightful pair 

of ornaments for the two ends of any capacious old-fashioned 

chimneypiece, and by right should never have been seen apart, was 

the childless wife of a clergyman holding Corporation preferment in 

London City.  Mr. Honeythunder in his public character of Professor 

of Philanthropy had come to know Mrs. Crisparkle during the last 

re-matching of the china ornaments (in other words during her last 

annual visit to her sister), after a public occasion of a 

philanthropic nature, when certain devoted orphans of tender years 

had been glutted with plum buns, and plump bumptiousness.  These 

were all the antecedents known in Minor Canon Corner of the coming 

pupils.



'I am sure you will agree with me, Ma,' said Mr. Crisparkle, after 

thinking the matter over, 'that the first thing to be done, is, to 

put these young people as much at their ease as possible.  There is 

nothing disinterested in the notion, because we cannot be at our 

ease with them unless they are at their ease with us.  Now, 

Jasper's nephew is down here at present; and like takes to like, 

and youth takes to youth.  He is a cordial young fellow, and we 

will have him to meet the brother and sister at dinner.  That's 

three.  We can't think of asking him, without asking Jasper.  

That's four.  Add Miss Twinkleton and the fairy bride that is to 

be, and that's six.  Add our two selves, and that's eight.  Would 

eight at a friendly dinner at all put you out, Ma?'



'Nine would, Sept,' returned the old lady, visibly nervous.



'My dear Ma, I particularise eight.'



'The exact size of the table and the room, my dear.'



So it was settled that way:  and when Mr. Crisparkle called with 

his mother upon Miss Twinkleton, to arrange for the reception of 

Miss Helena Landless at the Nuns' House, the two other invitations 

having reference to that establishment were proffered and accepted.  

Miss Twinkleton did, indeed, glance at the globes, as regretting 

that they were not formed to be taken out into society; but became 

reconciled to leaving them behind.  Instructions were then 

despatched to the Philanthropist for the departure and arrival, in 

good time for dinner, of Mr. Neville and Miss Helena; and stock for 

soup became fragrant in the air of Minor Canon Corner.



In those days there was no railway to Cloisterham, and Mr. Sapsea 

said there never would be.  Mr. Sapsea said more; he said there 

never should be.  And yet, marvellous to consider, it has come to 

pass, in these days, that Express Trains don't think Cloisterham 

worth stopping at, but yell and whirl through it on their larger 

errands, casting the dust off their wheels as a testimony against 

its insignificance.  Some remote fragment of Main Line to somewhere 

else, there was, which was going to ruin the Money Market if it 

failed, and Church and State if it succeeded, and (of course), the 

Constitution, whether or no; but even that had already so unsettled 

Cloisterham traffic, that the traffic, deserting the high road, 

came sneaking in from an unprecedented part of the country by a 

back stable-way, for many years labelled at the corner:  'Beware of 

the Dog.'



To this ignominious avenue of approach, Mr. Crisparkle repaired, 

awaiting the arrival of a short, squat omnibus, with a 

disproportionate heap of luggage on the roof - like a little 

Elephant with infinitely too much Castle - which was then the daily 

service between Cloisterham and external mankind.  As this vehicle 

lumbered up, Mr. Crisparkle could hardly see anything else of it 

for a large outside passenger seated on the box, with his elbows 

squared, and his hands on his knees, compressing the driver into a 

most uncomfortably small compass, and glowering about him with a 

strongly-marked face.



'Is this Cloisterham?' demanded the passenger, in a tremendous 

voice.



'It is,' replied the driver, rubbing himself as if he ached, after 

throwing the reins to the ostler.  'And I never was so glad to see 

it.'



'Tell your master to make his box-seat wider, then,' returned the 

passenger.  'Your master is morally bound - and ought to be 

legally, under ruinous penalties - to provide for the comfort of 

his fellow-man.'



The driver instituted, with the palms of his hands, a superficial 

perquisition into the state of his skeleton; which seemed to make 

him anxious.



'Have I sat upon you?' asked the passenger.



'You have,' said the driver, as if he didn't like it at all.



'Take that card, my friend.'



'I think I won't deprive you on it,' returned the driver, casting 

his eyes over it with no great favour, without taking it.  'What's 

the good of it to me?'



'Be a Member of that Society,' said the passenger.



'What shall I get by it?' asked the driver.



'Brotherhood,' returned the passenger, in a ferocious voice.



'Thankee,' said the driver, very deliberately, as he got down; 'my 

mother was contented with myself, and so am I.  I don't want no 

brothers.'



'But you must have them,' replied the passenger, also descending, 

'whether you like it or not.  I am your brother.'



' I say!' expostulated the driver, becoming more chafed in temper, 

'not too fur!  The worm WILL, when - '



But here, Mr. Crisparkle interposed, remonstrating aside, in a 

friendly voice:  'Joe, Joe, Joe! don't forget yourself, Joe, my 

good fellow!' and then, when Joe peaceably touched his hat, 

accosting the passenger with:  'Mr. Honeythunder?'



'That is my name, sir.'



'My name is Crisparkle.'



'Reverend Mr. Septimus?  Glad to see you, sir.  Neville and Helena 

are inside.  Having a little succumbed of late, under the pressure 

of my public labours, I thought I would take a mouthful of fresh 

air, and come down with them, and return at night.  So you are the 

Reverend Mr. Septimus, are you?' surveying him on the whole with 

disappointment, and twisting a double eyeglass by its ribbon, as if 

he were roasting it, but not otherwise using it.  'Hah!  I expected 

to see you older, sir.'



'I hope you will,' was the good-humoured reply.



'Eh?' demanded Mr. Honeythunder.



'Only a poor little joke.  Not worth repeating.'



'Joke?  Ay; I never see a joke,' Mr. Honeythunder frowningly 

retorted.  'A joke is wasted upon me, sir.  Where are they?  Helena 

and Neville, come here!  Mr. Crisparkle has come down to meet you.'



An unusually handsome lithe young fellow, and an unusually handsome 

lithe girl; much alike; both very dark, and very rich in colour; 

she of almost the gipsy type; something untamed about them both; a 

certain air upon them of hunter and huntress; yet withal a certain 

air of being the objects of the chase, rather than the followers.  

Slender, supple, quick of eye and limb; half shy, half defiant; 

fierce of look; an indefinable kind of pause coming and going on 

their whole expression, both of face and form, which might be 

equally likened to the pause before a crouch or a bound.  The rough 

mental notes made in the first five minutes by Mr. Crisparkle would 

have read thus, VERBATIM.



He invited Mr. Honeythunder to dinner, with a troubled mind (for 

the discomfiture of the dear old china shepherdess lay heavy on 

it), and gave his arm to Helena Landless.  Both she and her 

brother, as they walked all together through the ancient streets, 

took great delight in what he pointed out of the Cathedral and the 

Monastery ruin, and wondered - so his notes ran on - much as if 

they were beautiful barbaric captives brought from some wild 

tropical dominion.  Mr. Honeythunder walked in the middle of the 

road, shouldering the natives out of his way, and loudly developing 

a scheme he had, for making a raid on all the unemployed persons in 

the United Kingdom, laying them every one by the heels in jail, and 

forcing them, on pain of prompt extermination, to become 

philanthropists.



Mrs. Crisparkle had need of her own share of philanthropy when she 

beheld this very large and very loud excrescence on the little 

party.  Always something in the nature of a Boil upon the face of 

society, Mr. Honeythunder expanded into an inflammatory Wen in 

Minor Canon Corner.  Though it was not literally true, as was 

facetiously charged against him by public unbelievers, that he 

called aloud to his fellow-creatures:  'Curse your souls and 

bodies, come here and be blessed!' still his philanthropy was of 

that gunpowderous sort that the difference between it and animosity 

was hard to determine.  You were to abolish military force, but you 

were first to bring all commanding officers who had done their 

duty, to trial by court-martial for that offence, and shoot them.  

You were to abolish war, but were to make converts by making war 

upon them, and charging them with loving war as the apple of their 

eye.  You were to have no capital punishment, but were first to 

sweep off the face of the earth all legislators, jurists, and 

judges, who were of the contrary opinion.  You were to have 

universal concord, and were to get it by eliminating all the people 

who wouldn't, or conscientiously couldn't, be concordant.  You were 

to love your brother as yourself, but after an indefinite interval 

of maligning him (very much as if you hated him), and calling him 

all manner of names.  Above all things, you were to do nothing in 

private, or on your own account.  You were to go to the offices of 

the Haven of Philanthropy, and put your name down as a Member and a 

Professing Philanthropist.  Then, you were to pay up your 

subscription, get your card of membership and your riband and 

medal, and were evermore to live upon a platform, and evermore to 

say what Mr. Honeythunder said, and what the Treasurer said, and 

what the sub-Treasurer said, and what the Committee said, and what 

the sub-Committee said, and what the Secretary said, and what the 

Vice-Secretary said.  And this was usually said in the unanimously-

carried resolution under hand and seal, to the effect:  'That this 

assembled Body of Professing Philanthropists views, with indignant 

scorn and contempt, not unmixed with utter detestation and loathing 

abhorrence' - in short, the baseness of all those who do not belong 

to it, and pledges itself to make as many obnoxious statements as 

possible about them, without being at all particular as to facts.



The dinner was a most doleful breakdown.  The philanthropist 

deranged the symmetry of the table, sat himself in the way of the 

waiting, blocked up the thoroughfare, and drove Mr. Tope (who 

assisted the parlour-maid) to the verge of distraction by passing 

plates and dishes on, over his own head.  Nobody could talk to 

anybody, because he held forth to everybody at once, as if the 

company had no individual existence, but were a Meeting.  He 

impounded the Reverend Mr. Septimus, as an official personage to be 

addressed, or kind of human peg to hang his oratorical hat on, and 

fell into the exasperating habit, common among such orators, of 

impersonating him as a wicked and weak opponent.  Thus, he would 

ask:  'And will you, sir, now stultify yourself by telling me' - 

and so forth, when the innocent man had not opened his lips, nor 

meant to open them.  Or he would say:  'Now see, sir, to what a 

position you are reduced.  I will leave you no escape.  After 

exhausting all the resources of fraud and falsehood, during years 

upon years; after exhibiting a combination of dastardly meanness 

with ensanguined daring, such as the world has not often witnessed; 

you have now the hypocrisy to bend the knee before the most 

degraded of mankind, and to sue and whine and howl for mercy!'  

Whereat the unfortunate Minor Canon would look, in part indignant 

and in part perplexed; while his worthy mother sat bridling, with 

tears in her eyes, and the remainder of the party lapsed into a 

sort of gelatinous state, in which there was no flavour or 

solidity, and very little resistance.



But the gush of philanthropy that burst forth when the departure of 

Mr. Honeythunder began to impend, must have been highly gratifying 

to the feelings of that distinguished man.  His coffee was 

produced, by the special activity of Mr. Tope, a full hour before 

he wanted it.  Mr. Crisparkle sat with his watch in his hand for 

about the same period, lest he should overstay his time.  The four 

young people were unanimous in believing that the Cathedral clock 

struck three-quarters, when it actually struck but one.  Miss 

Twinkleton estimated the distance to the omnibus at five-and-twenty 

minutes' walk, when it was really five.  The affectionate kindness 

of the whole circle hustled him into his greatcoat, and shoved him 

out into the moonlight, as if he were a fugitive traitor with whom 

they sympathised, and a troop of horse were at the back door.  Mr. 

Crisparkle and his new charge, who took him to the omnibus, were so 

fervent in their apprehensions of his catching cold, that they shut 

him up in it instantly and left him, with still half-an-hour to 

spare.
