AT about this time a stranger appeared in Cloisterham; a white-

haired personage, with black eyebrows.  Being buttoned up in a 

tightish blue surtout, with a buff waistcoat and gray trousers, he 

had something of a military air, but he announced himself at the 

Crozier (the orthodox hotel, where he put up with a portmanteau) as 

an idle dog who lived upon his means; and he farther announced that 

he had a mind to take a lodging in the picturesque old city for a 

month or two, with a view of settling down there altogether.  Both 

announcements were made in the coffee-room of the Crozier, to all 

whom it might or might not concern, by the stranger as he stood 

with his back to the empty fireplace, waiting for his fried sole, 

veal cutlet, and pint of sherry.  And the waiter (business being 

chronically slack at the Crozier) represented all whom it might or 

might not concern, and absorbed the whole of the information.



This gentleman's white head was unusually large, and his shock of 

white hair was unusually thick and ample.  'I suppose, waiter,' he 

said, shaking his shock of hair, as a Newfoundland dog might shake 

his before sitting down to dinner, 'that a fair lodging for a 

single buffer might be found in these parts, eh?'



The waiter had no doubt of it.



'Something old,' said the gentleman.  'Take my hat down for a 

moment from that peg, will you?  No, I don't want it; look into it.  

What do you see written there?'



The waiter read:  'Datchery.'



'Now you know my name,' said the gentleman; 'Dick Datchery.  Hang 

it up again.  I was saying something old is what I should prefer, 

something odd and out of the way; something venerable, 

architectural, and inconvenient.'



'We have a good choice of inconvenient lodgings in the town, sir, I 

think,' replied the waiter, with modest confidence in its resources 

that way; 'indeed, I have no doubt that we could suit you that far, 

however particular you might be.  But a architectural lodging!'  

That seemed to trouble the waiter's head, and he shook it.



'Anything Cathedraly, now,' Mr. Datchery suggested.



'Mr. Tope,' said the waiter, brightening, as he rubbed his chin 

with his hand, 'would be the likeliest party to inform in that 

line.'



'Who is Mr. Tope?' inquired Dick Datchery.



The waiter explained that he was the Verger, and that Mrs. Tope had 

indeed once upon a time let lodgings herself or offered to let 

them; but that as nobody had ever taken them, Mrs. Tope's window-

bill, long a Cloisterham Institution, had disappeared; probably had 

tumbled down one day, and never been put up again.



'I'll call on Mrs. Tope,' said Mr. Datchery, 'after dinner.'



So when he had done his dinner, he was duly directed to the spot, 

and sallied out for it.  But the Crozier being an hotel of a most 

retiring disposition, and the waiter's directions being fatally 

precise, he soon became bewildered, and went boggling about and 

about the Cathedral Tower, whenever he could catch a glimpse of it, 

with a general impression on his mind that Mrs. Tope's was 

somewhere very near it, and that, like the children in the game of 

hot boiled beans and very good butter, he was warm in his search 

when he saw the Tower, and cold when he didn't see it.



He was getting very cold indeed when he came upon a fragment of 

burial-ground in which an unhappy sheep was grazing.  Unhappy, 

because a hideous small boy was stoning it through the railings, 

and had already lamed it in one leg, and was much excited by the 

benevolent sportsmanlike purpose of breaking its other three legs, 

and bringing it down.



''It 'im agin!' cried the boy, as the poor creature leaped; 'and 

made a dint in his wool.'



'Let him be!' said Mr. Datchery.  'Don't you see you have lamed 

him?'



'Yer lie,' returned the sportsman.  ''E went and lamed isself.  I 

see 'im do it, and I giv' 'im a shy as a Widdy-warning to 'im not 

to go a-bruisin' 'is master's mutton any more.'



'Come here.'



'I won't; I'll come when yer can ketch me.'



'Stay there then, and show me which is Mr. Tope's.'



'Ow can I stay here and show you which is Topeseses, when Topeseses 

is t'other side the Kinfreederal, and over the crossings, and round 

ever so many comers?  Stoo-pid!  Ya-a-ah!'



'Show me where it is, and I'll give you something.'



'Come on, then.'



This brisk dialogue concluded, the boy led the way, and by-and-by 

stopped at some distance from an arched passage, pointing.



'Lookie yonder.  You see that there winder and door?'



'That's Tope's?'



'Yer lie; it ain't.  That's Jarsper's.'



'Indeed?' said Mr. Datchery, with a second look of some interest.



'Yes, and I ain't a-goin' no nearer 'IM, I tell yer.'



'Why not?'



''Cos I ain't a-goin' to be lifted off my legs and 'ave my braces 

bust and be choked; not if I knows it, and not by 'Im.  Wait till I 

set a jolly good flint a-flyin' at the back o' 'is jolly old 'ed 

some day!  Now look t'other side the harch; not the side where 

Jarsper's door is; t'other side.'



'I see.'



'A little way in, o' that side, there's a low door, down two steps.  

That's Topeseses with 'is name on a hoval plate.'



'Good.  See here,' said Mr. Datchery, producing a shilling.  'You 

owe me half of this.'



'Yer lie  I don't owe yer nothing; I never seen yer.'



'I tell you you owe me half of this, because I have no sixpence in 

my pocket.  So the next time you meet me you shall do something 

else for me, to pay me.'



'All right, give us 'old.'



'What is your name, and where do you live?'



'Deputy.  Travellers' Twopenny, 'cross the green.'



The boy instantly darted off with the shilling, lest Mr. Datchery 

should repent, but stopped at a safe distance, on the happy chance 

of his being uneasy in his mind about it, to goad him with a demon 

dance expressive of its irrevocability.



Mr. Datchery, taking off his hat to give that shock of white hair 

of his another shake, seemed quite resigned, and betook himself 

whither he had been directed.



Mr. Tope's official dwelling, communicating by an upper stair with 

Mr. Jasper's (hence Mrs. Tope's attendance on that gentleman), was 

of very modest proportions, and partook of the character of a cool 

dungeon.  Its ancient walls were massive, and its rooms rather 

seemed to have been dug out of them, than to have been designed 

beforehand with any reference to them.  The main door opened at 

once on a chamber of no describable shape, with a groined roof, 

which in its turn opened on another chamber of no describable 

shape, with another groined roof:  their windows small, and in the 

thickness of the walls.  These two chambers, close as to their 

atmosphere, and swarthy as to their illumination by natural light, 

were the apartments which Mrs. Tope had so long offered to an 

unappreciative city.  Mr. Datchery, however, was more appreciative.  

He found that if he sat with the main door open he would enjoy the 

passing society of all comers to and fro by the gateway, and would 

have light enough.  He found that if Mr. and Mrs. Tope, living 

overhead, used for their own egress and ingress a little side stair 

that came plump into the Precincts by a door opening outward, to 

the surprise and inconvenience of a limited public of pedestrians 

in a narrow way, he would be alone, as in a separate residence.  He 

found the rent moderate, and everything as quaintly inconvenient as 

he could desire.  He agreed, therefore, to take the lodging then 

and there, and money down, possession to be had next evening, on 

condition that reference was permitted him to Mr. Jasper as 

occupying the gatehouse, of which on the other side of the gateway, 

the Verger's hole-in-the-wall was an appanage or subsidiary part.



The poor dear gentleman was very solitary and very sad, Mrs. Tope 

said, but she had no doubt he would 'speak for her.'  Perhaps Mr. 

Datchery had heard something of what had occurred there last 

winter?



Mr. Datchery had as confused a knowledge of the event in question, 

on trying to recall it, as he well could have.  He begged Mrs. 

Tope's pardon when she found it incumbent on her to correct him in 

every detail of his summary of the facts, but pleaded that he was 

merely a single buffer getting through life upon his means as idly 

as he could, and that so many people were so constantly making away 

with so many other people, as to render it difficult for a buffer 

of an easy temper to preserve the circumstances of the several 

cases unmixed in his mind.



Mr. Jasper proving willing to speak for Mrs. Tope, Mr. Datchery, 

who had sent up his card, was invited to ascend the postern 

staircase.  The Mayor was there, Mr. Tope said; but he was not to 

be regarded in the light of company, as he and Mr. Jasper were 

great friends.



'I beg pardon,' said Mr. Datchery, making a leg with his hat under 

his arm, as he addressed himself equally to both gentlemen; 'a 

selfish precaution on my part, and not personally interesting to 

anybody but myself.  But as a buffer living on his means, and 

having an idea of doing it in this lovely place in peace and quiet, 

for remaining span of life, I beg to ask if the Tope family are 

quite respectable?'



Mr. Jasper could answer for that without the slightest hesitation.



'That is enough, sir,' said Mr. Datchery.



'My friend the Mayor,' added Mr. Jasper, presenting Mr. Datchery 

with a courtly motion of his hand towards that potentate; 'whose 

recommendation is actually much more important to a stranger than 

that of an obscure person like myself, will testify in their 

behalf, I am sure.'



'The Worshipful the Mayor,' said Mr. Datchery, with a low bow, 

'places me under an infinite obligation.'



'Very good people, sir, Mr. and Mrs. Tope,' said Mr. Sapsea, with 

condescension.  'Very good opinions.  Very well behaved.  Very 

respectful.  Much approved by the Dean and Chapter.'



'The Worshipful the Mayor gives them a character,' said Mr. 

Datchery, 'of which they may indeed be proud.  I would ask His 

Honour (if I might be permitted) whether there are not many objects 

of great interest in the city which is under his beneficent sway?'



'We are, sir,' returned Mr. Sapsea, 'an ancient city, and an 

ecclesiastical city.  We are a constitutional city, as it becomes 

such a city to be, and we uphold and maintain our glorious 

privileges.'



'His Honour,' said Mr. Datchery, bowing, 'inspires me with a desire 

to know more of the city, and confirms me in my inclination to end 

my days in the city.'



'Retired from the Army, sir?' suggested Mr. Sapsea.



'His Honour the Mayor does me too much credit,' returned Mr. 

Datchery.



'Navy, sir?' suggested Mr. Sapsea.



'Again,' repeated Mr. Datchery, 'His Honour the Mayor does me too 

much credit.'



'Diplomacy is a fine profession,' said Mr. Sapsea, as a general 

remark.



'There, I confess, His Honour the Mayor is too many for me,' said 

Mr. Datchery, with an ingenious smile and bow; 'even a diplomatic 

bird must fall to such a gun.'



Now this was very soothing.  Here was a gentleman of a great, not 

to say a grand, address, accustomed to rank and dignity, really 

setting a fine example how to behave to a Mayor.  There was 

something in that third-person style of being spoken to, that Mr. 

Sapsea found particularly recognisant of his merits and position.



'But I crave pardon,' said Mr. Datchery.  'His Honour the Mayor 

will bear with me, if for a moment I have been deluded into 

occupying his time, and have forgotten the humble claims upon my 

own, of my hotel, the Crozier.'



'Not at all, sir,' said Mr. Sapsea.  'I am returning home, and if 

you would like to take the exterior of our Cathedral in your way, I 

shall be glad to point it out.'



'His Honour the Mayor,' said Mr. Datchery, 'is more than kind and 

gracious.'



As Mr. Datchery, when he had made his acknowledgments to Mr. 

Jasper, could not be induced to go out of the room before the 

Worshipful, the Worshipful led the way down-stairs; Mr. Datchery 

following with his hat under his arm, and his shock of white hair 

streaming in the evening breeze.



'Might I ask His Honour,' said Mr. Datchery, 'whether that 

gentleman we have just left is the gentleman of whom I have heard 

in the neighbourhood as being much afflicted by the loss of a 

nephew, and concentrating his life on avenging the loss?'



'That is the gentleman.  John Jasper, sir.'



'Would His Honour allow me to inquire whether there are strong 

suspicions of any one?'



'More than suspicions, sir,' returned Mr. Sapsea; 'all but 

certainties.'



'Only think now!' cried Mr. Datchery.



'But proof, sir, proof must be built up stone by stone,' said the 

Mayor.  'As I say, the end crowns the work.  It is not enough that 

justice should be morally certain; she must be immorally certain - 

legally, that is.'



'His Honour,' said Mr. Datchery, 'reminds me of the nature of the 

law.  Immoral.  How true!'



'As I say, sir,' pompously went on the Mayor, 'the arm of the law 

is a strong arm, and a long arm.  That is the may I put it.  A 

strong arm and a long arm.'



'How forcible! - And yet, again, how true!' murmured Mr. Datchery.



'And without betraying, what I call the secrets of the prison-

house,' said Mr. Sapsea; 'the secrets of the prison-house is the 

term I used on the bench.'



'And what other term than His Honour's would express it?' said Mr. 

Datchery.



'Without, I say, betraying them, I predict to you, knowing the iron 

will of the gentleman we have just left (I take the bold step of 

calling it iron, on account of its strength), that in this case the 

long arm will reach, and the strong arm will strike. - This is our 

Cathedral, sir.  The best judges are pleased to admire it, and the 

best among our townsmen own to being a little vain of it.'



All this time Mr. Datchery had walked with his hat under his arm, 

and his white hair streaming.  He had an odd momentary appearance 

upon him of having forgotten his hat, when Mr. Sapsea now touched 

it; and he clapped his hand up to his head as if with some vague 

expectation of finding another hat upon it.



'Pray be covered, sir,' entreated Mr. Sapsea; magnificently plying:  

'I shall not mind it, I assure you.'



'His Honour is very good, but I do it for coolness,' said Mr. 

Datchery.



Then Mr. Datchery admired the Cathedral, and Mr. Sapsea pointed it 

out as if he himself had invented and built it:  there were a few 

details indeed of which he did not approve, but those he glossed 

over, as if the workmen had made mistakes in his absence.  The 

Cathedral disposed of, he led the way by the churchyard, and 

stopped to extol the beauty of the evening - by chance - in the 

immediate vicinity of Mrs. Sapsea's epitaph.



'And by the by,' said Mr. Sapsea, appearing to descend from an 

elevation to remember it all of a sudden; like Apollo shooting down 

from Olympus to pick up his forgotten lyre; 'THAT is one of our 

small lions.  The partiality of our people has made it so, and 

strangers have been seen taking a copy of it now and then.  I am 

not a judge of it myself, for it is a little work of my own.  But 

it was troublesome to turn, sir; I may say, difficult to turn with 

elegance.'



Mr. Datchery became so ecstatic over Mr. Sapsea's composition, 

that, in spite of his intention to end his days in Cloisterham, and 

therefore his probably having in reserve many opportunities of 

copying it, he would have transcribed it into his pocket-book on 

the spot, but for the slouching towards them of its material 

producer and perpetuator, Durdles, whom Mr. Sapsea hailed, not 

sorry to show him a bright example of behaviour to superiors.



'Ah, Durdles!  This is the mason, sir; one of our Cloisterham 

worthies; everybody here knows Durdles.  Mr. Datchery, Durdles a 

gentleman who is going to settle here.'



'I wouldn't do it if I was him,' growled Durdles.  'We're a heavy 

lot.'



'You surely don't speak for yourself, Mr. Durdles,' returned Mr. 

Datchery, 'any more than for His Honour.'



'Who's His Honour?' demanded Durdles.



'His Honour the Mayor.'



'I never was brought afore him,' said Durdles, with anything but 

the look of a loyal subject of the mayoralty, 'and it'll be time 

enough for me to Honour him when I am.  Until which, and when, and 

where,





"Mister Sapsea is his name,

England is his nation,

Cloisterham's his dwelling-place,

Aukshneer's his occupation."'





Here, Deputy (preceded by a flying oyster-shell) appeared upon the 

scene, and requested to have the sum of threepence instantly 

'chucked' to him by Mr. Durdles, whom he had been vainly seeking up 

and down, as lawful wages overdue.  While that gentleman, with his 

bundle under his arm, slowly found and counted out the money, Mr. 

Sapsea informed the new settler of Durdles's habits, pursuits, 

abode, and reputation.  'I suppose a curious stranger might come to 

see you, and your works, Mr. Durdles, at any odd time?' said Mr. 

Datchery upon that.



'Any gentleman is welcome to come and see me any evening if he 

brings liquor for two with him,' returned Durdles, with a penny 

between his teeth and certain halfpence in his hands; 'or if he 

likes to make it twice two, he'll be doubly welcome.'



'I shall come.  Master Deputy, what do you owe me?'



'A job.'



'Mind you pay me honestly with the job of showing me Mr. Durdles's 

house when I want to go there.'



Deputy, with a piercing broadside of whistle through the whole gap 

in his mouth, as a receipt in full for all arrears, vanished.



The Worshipful and the Worshipper then passed on together until 

they parted, with many ceremonies, at the Worshipful's door; even 

then the Worshipper carried his hat under his arm, and gave his 

streaming white hair to the breeze.



Said Mr. Datchery to himself that night, as he looked at his white 

hair in the gas-lighted looking-glass over the coffee-room 

chimneypiece at the Crozier, and shook it out:  'For a single 

buffer, of an easy temper, living idly on his means, I have had a 

rather busy afternoon!'
