ROSA no sooner came to herself than the whole of the late interview 

was before her.  It even seemed as if it had pursued her into her 

insensibility, and she had not had a moment's unconsciousness of 

it.  What to do, she was at a frightened loss to know:  the only 

one clear thought in her mind was, that she must fly from this 

terrible man.



But where could she take refuge, and how could she go?  She had 

never breathed her dread of him to any one but Helena.  If she went 

to Helena, and told her what had passed, that very act might bring 

down the irreparable mischief that he threatened he had the power, 

and that she knew he had the will, to do.  The more fearful he 

appeared to her excited memory and imagination, the more alarming 

her responsibility appeared; seeing that a slight mistake on her 

part, either in action or delay, might let his malevolence loose on 

Helena's brother.



Rosa's mind throughout the last six months had been stormily 

confused.  A half-formed, wholly unexpressed suspicion tossed in 

it, now heaving itself up, and now sinking into the deep; now 

gaining palpability, and now losing it.  Jasper's self-absorption 

in his nephew when he was alive, and his unceasing pursuit of the 

inquiry how he came by his death, if he were dead, were themes so 

rife in the place, that no one appeared able to suspect the 

possibility of foul play at his hands.  She had asked herself the 

question, 'Am I so wicked in my thoughts as to conceive a 

wickedness that others cannot imagine?'  Then she had considered, 

Did the suspicion come of her previous recoiling from him before 

the fact?  And if so, was not that a proof of its baselessness?  

Then she had reflected, 'What motive could he have, according to my 

accusation?'  She was ashamed to answer in her mind, 'The motive of 

gaining ME!'  And covered her face, as if the lightest shadow of 

the idea of founding murder on such an idle vanity were a crime 

almost as great.



She ran over in her mind again, all that he had said by the sun-

dial in the garden.  He had persisted in treating the disappearance 

as murder, consistently with his whole public course since the 

finding of the watch and shirt-pin.  If he were afraid of the crime 

being traced out, would he not rather encourage the idea of a 

voluntary disappearance?  He had even declared that if the ties 

between him and his nephew had been less strong, he might have 

swept 'even him' away from her side.  Was that like his having 

really done so?  He had spoken of laying his six months' labours in 

the cause of a just vengeance at her feet.  Would he have done 

that, with that violence of passion, if they were a pretence?  

Would he have ranged them with his desolate heart and soul, his 

wasted life, his peace and his despair?  The very first sacrifice 

that he represented himself as making for her, was his fidelity to 

his dear boy after death.  Surely these facts were strong against a 

fancy that scarcely dared to hint itself.  And yet he was so 

terrible a man!  In short, the poor girl (for what could she know 

of the criminal intellect, which its own professed students 

perpetually misread, because they persist in trying to reconcile it 

with the average intellect of average men, instead of identifying 

it as a horrible wonder apart) could get by no road to any other 

conclusion than that he WAS a terrible man, and must be fled from.



She had been Helena's stay and comfort during the whole time.  She 

had constantly assured her of her full belief in her brother's 

innocence, and of her sympathy with him in his misery.  But she had 

never seen him since the disappearance, nor had Helena ever spoken 

one word of his avowal to Mr. Crisparkle in regard of Rosa, though 

as a part of the interest of the case it was well known far and 

wide.  He was Helena's unfortunate brother, to her, and nothing 

more.  The assurance she had given her odious suitor was strictly 

true, though it would have been better (she considered now) if she 

could have restrained herself from so giving it.  Afraid of him as 

the bright and delicate little creature was, her spirit swelled at 

the thought of his knowing it from her own lips.



But where was she to go?  Anywhere beyond his reach, was no reply 

to the question.  Somewhere must be thought of.  She determined to 

go to her guardian, and to go immediately.  The feeling she had 

imparted to Helena on the night of their first confidence, was so 

strong upon her - the feeling of not being safe from him, and of 

the solid walls of the old convent being powerless to keep out his 

ghostly following of her - that no reasoning of her own could calm 

her terrors.  The fascination of repulsion had been upon her so 

long, and now culminated so darkly, that she felt as if he had 

power to bind her by a spell.  Glancing out at window, even now, as 

she rose to dress, the sight of the sun-dial on which he had leaned 

when he declared himself, turned her cold, and made her shrink from 

it, as though he had invested it with some awful quality from his 

own nature.



She wrote a hurried note to Miss Twinkleton, saying that she had 

sudden reason for wishing to see her guardian promptly, and had 

gone to him; also, entreating the good lady not to be uneasy, for 

all was well with her.  She hurried a few quite useless articles 

into a very little bag, left the note in a conspicuous place, and 

went out, softly closing the gate after her.



It was the first time she had ever been even in Cloisterham High 

Street alone.  But knowing all its ways and windings very well, she 

hurried straight to the corner from which the omnibus departed.  It 

was, at that very moment, going off.



'Stop and take me, if you please, Joe.  I am obliged to go to 

London.'



In less than another minute she was on her road to the railway, 

under Joe's protection. Joe waited on her when she got there, put 

her safely into the railway carriage, and handed in the very little 

bag after her, as though it were some enormous trunk, 

hundredweights heavy, which she must on no account endeavour to 

lift.



'Can you go round when you get back, and tell Miss Twinkleton that 

you saw me safely off, Joe



'It shall be done, Miss.'



'With my love, please, Joe.'



'Yes, Miss - and I wouldn't mind having it myself!'  But Joe did 

not articulate the last clause; only thought it.



Now that she was whirling away for London in real earnest, Rosa was 

at leisure to resume the thoughts which her personal hurry had 

checked.  The indignant thought that his declaration of love soiled 

her; that she could only be cleansed from the stain of its impurity 

by appealing to the honest and true; supported her for a time 

against her fears, and confirmed her in her hasty resolution.  But 

as the evening grew darker and darker, and the great city impended 

nearer and nearer, the doubts usual in such cases began to arise.  

Whether this was not a wild proceeding, after all; how Mr. 

Grewgious might regard it; whether she should find him at the 

journey's end; how she would act if he were absent; what might 

become of her, alone, in a place so strange and crowded; how if she 

had but waited and taken counsel first; whether, if she could now 

go back, she would not do it thankfully; a multitude of such uneasy 

speculations disturbed her, more and more as they accumulated.  At 

length the train came into London over the housetops; and down 

below lay the gritty streets with their yet un-needed lamps a-glow, 

on a hot, light, summer night.



'Hiram Grewgious, Esquire, Staple Inn, London.'  This was all Rosa 

knew of her destination; but it was enough to send her rattling 

away again in a cab, through deserts of gritty streets, where many 

people crowded at the corner of courts and byways to get some air, 

and where many other people walked with a miserably monotonous 

noise of shuffling of feet on hot paving-stones, and where all the 

people and all their surroundings were so gritty and so shabby!



There was music playing here and there, but it did not enliven the 

case.  No barrel-organ mended the matter, and no big drum beat dull 

care away.  Like the chapel bells that were also going here and 

there, they only seemed to evoke echoes from brick surfaces, and 

dust from everything.  As to the flat wind-instruments, they seemed 

to have cracked their hearts and souls in pining for the country.



Her jingling conveyance stopped at last at a fast-closed gateway, 

which appeared to belong to somebody who had gone to bed very 

early, and was much afraid of housebreakers; Rosa, discharging her 

conveyance, timidly knocked at this gateway, and was let in, very 

little bag and all, by a watchman.



'Does Mr. Grewgious live here?'



'Mr. Grewgious lives there, Miss,' said the watchman, pointing 

further in.



So Rosa went further in, and, when the clocks were striking ten, 

stood on P. J. T.'s doorsteps, wondering what P. J. T. had done 

with his street-door.



Guided by the painted name of Mr. Grewgious, she went up-stairs and 

softly tapped and tapped several times.  But no one answering, and 

Mr. Grewgious's door-handle yielding to her touch, she went in, and 

saw her guardian sitting on a window-seat at an open window, with a 

shaded lamp placed far from him on a table in a corner.



Rosa drew nearer to him in the twilight of the room.  He saw her, 

and he said, in an undertone:  'Good Heaven!'



Rosa fell upon his neck, with tears, and then he said, returning 

her embrace:



'My child, my child!  I thought you were your mother! - But what, 

what, what,' he added, soothingly, 'has happened?  My dear, what 

has brought you here?  Who has brought you here?'



'No one.  I came alone.'



'Lord bless me!' ejaculated Mr. Grewgious.  'Came alone!  Why 

didn't you write to me to come and fetch you?'



'I had no time.  I took a sudden resolution.  Poor, poor Eddy!'



'Ah, poor fellow, poor fellow!'



'His uncle has made love to me.  I cannot bear it,' said Rosa, at 

once with a burst of tears, and a stamp of her little foot; 'I 

shudder with horror of him, and I have come to you to protect me 

and all of us from him, if you will?'



'I will,' cried Mr. Grewgious, with a sudden rush of amazing 

energy.  'Damn him!





"Confound his politics! 

Frustrate his knavish tricks! 

On Thee his hopes to fix?

Damn him again!"'





After this most extraordinary outburst, Mr. Grewgious, quite beside 

himself, plunged about the room, to all appearance undecided 

whether he was in a fit of loyal enthusiasm, or combative 

denunciation.



He stopped and said, wiping his face:  'I beg your pardon, my dear, 

but you will be glad to know I feel better.  Tell me no more just 

now, or I might do it again.  You must be refreshed and cheered.  

What did you take last?  Was it breakfast, lunch, dinner, tea, or 

supper?  And what will you take next?  Shall it be breakfast, 

lunch, dinner, tea, or supper?'



The respectful tenderness with which, on one knee before her, he 

helped her to remove her hat, and disentangle her pretty hair from 

it, was quite a chivalrous sight.  Yet who, knowing him only on the 

surface, would have expected chivalry - and of the true sort, too; 

not the spurious - from Mr. Grewgious?



'Your rest too must be provided for,' he went on; 'and you shall 

have the prettiest chamber in Furnival's.  Your toilet must be 

provided for, and you shall have everything that an unlimited head 

chambermaid - by which expression I mean a head chambermaid not 

limited as to outlay - can procure.  Is that a bag?' he looked hard 

at it; sooth to say, it required hard looking at to be seen at all 

in a dimly lighted room:  'and is it your property, my dear?'



'Yes, sir.  I brought it with me.'



'It is not an extensive bag,' said Mr. Grewgious, candidly, 'though 

admirably calculated to contain a day's provision for a canary-

bird.  Perhaps you brought a canary-bird?'



Rosa smiled and shook her head.



'If you had, he should have been made welcome,' said Mr. Grewgious, 

'and I think he would have been pleased to be hung upon a nail 

outside and pit himself against our Staple sparrows; whose 

execution must be admitted to be not quite equal to their 

intention.  Which is the case with so many of us!  You didn't say 

what meal, my dear.  Have a nice jumble of all meals.'



Rosa thanked him, but said she could only take a cup of tea.  Mr. 

Grewgious, after several times running out, and in again, to 

mention such supplementary items as marmalade, eggs, watercresses, 

salted fish, and frizzled ham, ran across to Furnival's without his 

hat, to give his various directions.  And soon afterwards they were 

realised in practice, and the board was spread.



'Lord bless my soul,' cried Mr. Grewgious, putting the lamp upon 

it, and taking his seat opposite Rosa; 'what a new sensation for a 

poor old Angular bachelor, to be sure!'



Rosa's expressive little eyebrows asked him what he meant?



'The sensation of having a sweet young presence in the place, that 

whitewashes it, paints it, papers it, decorates it with gilding, 

and makes it Glorious!' said Mr. Grewgious.  'Ah me!  Ah me!'



As there was something mournful in his sigh, Rosa, in touching him 

with her tea-cup, ventured to touch him with her small hand too.



'Thank you, my dear,' said Mr. Grewgious.  'Ahem!  Let's talk!'



'Do you always live here, sir?' asked Rosa.



'Yes, my dear.'



'And always alone?'



'Always alone; except that I have daily company in a gentleman by 

the name of Bazzard, my clerk.'



'HE doesn't live here?'



'No, he goes his way, after office hours.  In fact, he is off duty 

here, altogether, just at present; and a firm down-stairs, with 

which I have business relations, lend me a substitute.  But it 

would be extremely difficult to replace Mr. Bazzard.'



'He must be very fond of you,' said Rosa.



'He bears up against it with commendable fortitude if he is,' 

returned Mr. Grewgious, after considering the matter.  'But I doubt 

if he is.  Not particularly so.  You see, he is discontented, poor 

fellow.'



'Why isn't he contented?' was the natural inquiry.



'Misplaced,' said Mr. Grewgious, with great mystery.



Rosa's eyebrows resumed their inquisitive and perplexed expression.



'So misplaced,' Mr. Grewgious went on, 'that I feel constantly 

apologetic towards him.  And he feels (though he doesn't mention 

it) that I have reason to be.'



Mr. Grewgious had by this time grown so very mysterious, that Rosa 

did not know how to go on.  While she was thinking about it Mr. 

Grewgious suddenly jerked out of himself for the second time:



'Let's talk.  We were speaking of Mr. Bazzard.  It's a secret, and 

moreover it is Mr. Bazzard's secret; but the sweet presence at my 

table makes me so unusually expansive, that I feel I must impart it 

in inviolable confidence.  What do you think Mr. Bazzard has done?'



'O dear!' cried Rosa, drawing her chair a little nearer, and her 

mind reverting to Jasper, 'nothing dreadful, I hope?'



'He has written a play,' said Mr. Grewgious, in a solemn whisper.  

'A tragedy.'



Rosa seemed much relieved.



'And nobody,' pursued Mr. Grewgious in the same tone, 'will hear, 

on any account whatever, of bringing it out.'



Rosa looked reflective, and nodded her head slowly; as who should 

say, 'Such things are, and why are they!'



'Now, you know,' said Mr. Grewgious, 'I couldn't write a play.'



'Not a bad one, sir?' said Rosa, innocently, with her eyebrows 

again in action.



'No.  If I was under sentence of decapitation, and was about to be 

instantly decapitated, and an express arrived with a pardon for the 

condemned convict Grewgious if he wrote a play, I should be under 

the necessity of resuming the block, and begging the executioner to 

proceed to extremities, - meaning,' said Mr. Grewgious, passing his 

hand under his chin, 'the singular number, and this extremity.'



Rosa appeared to consider what she would do if the awkward 

supposititious case were hers.



'Consequently,' said Mr. Grewgious, 'Mr. Bazzard would have a sense 

of my inferiority to himself under any circumstances; but when I am 

his master, you know, the case is greatly aggravated.'



Mr. Grewgious shook his head seriously, as if he felt the offence 

to be a little too much, though of his own committing.



'How came you to be his master, sir?' asked Rosa.



'A question that naturally follows,' said Mr. Grewgious.  'Let's 

talk.  Mr. Bazzard's father, being a Norfolk farmer, would have 

furiously laid about him with a flail, a pitch-fork, and every 

agricultural implement available for assaulting purposes, on the 

slightest hint of his son's having written a play.  So the son, 

bringing to me the father's rent (which I receive), imparted his 

secret, and pointed out that he was determined to pursue his 

genius, and that it would put him in peril of starvation, and that 

he was not formed for it.'



'For pursuing his genius, sir?'



'No, my dear,' said Mr. Grewgious, 'for starvation.  It was 

impossible to deny the position, that Mr. Bazzard was not formed to 

be starved, and Mr. Bazzard then pointed out that it was desirable 

that I should stand between him and a fate so perfectly unsuited to 

his formation.  In that way Mr. Bazzard became my clerk, and he 

feels it very much.'



'I am glad he is grateful,' said Rosa.



'I didn't quite mean that, my dear.  I mean, that he feels the 

degradation.  There are some other geniuses that Mr. Bazzard has 

become acquainted with, who have also written tragedies, which 

likewise nobody will on any account whatever hear of bringing out, 

and these choice spirits dedicate their plays to one another in a 

highly panegyrical manner.  Mr. Bazzard has been the subject of one 

of these dedications.  Now, you know, I never had a play dedicated 

to ME!'



Rosa looked at him as if she would have liked him to be the 

recipient of a thousand dedications.



'Which again, naturally, rubs against the grain of Mr. Bazzard,' 

said Mr. Grewgious.  'He is very short with me sometimes, and then 

I feel that he is meditating, "This blockhead is my master!  A 

fellow who couldn't write a tragedy on pain of death, and who will 

never have one dedicated to him with the most complimentary 

congratulations on the high position he has taken in the eyes of 

posterity!"  Very trying, very trying.  However, in giving him 

directions, I reflect beforehand:  "Perhaps he may not like this," 

or "He might take it ill if I asked that;" and so we get on very 

well.  Indeed, better than I could have expected.'



'Is the tragedy named, sir?' asked Rosa.



'Strictly between ourselves,' answered Mr. Grewgious, 'it has a 

dreadfully appropriate name.  It is called The Thorn of Anxiety.  

But Mr. Bazzard hopes - and I hope - that it will come out at 

last.'



It was not hard to divine that Mr. Grewgious had related the 

Bazzard history thus fully, at least quite as much for the 

recreation of his ward's mind from the subject that had driven her 

there, as for the gratification of his own tendency to be social 

and communicative.



'And now, my dear,' he said at this point, 'if you are not too 

tired to tell me more of what passed to-day - but only if you feel 

quite able - I should be glad to hear it.  I may digest it the 

better, if I sleep on it to-night.'



Rosa, composed now, gave him a faithful account of the interview.  

Mr. Grewgious often smoothed his head while it was in progress, and 

begged to be told a second time those parts which bore on Helena 

and Neville.  When Rosa had finished, he sat grave, silent, and 

meditative for a while.



'Clearly narrated,' was his only remark at last, 'and, I hope, 

clearly put away here,' smoothing his head again.  'See, my dear,' 

taking her to the open window, 'where they live!  The dark windows 

over yonder.'



'I may go to Helena to-morrow?' asked Rosa.



'I should like to sleep on that question to-night,' he answered 

doubtfully.  'But let me take you to your own rest, for you must 

need it.'



With that Mr. Grewgious helped her to get her hat on again, and 

hung upon his arm the very little bag that was of no earthly use, 

and led her by the hand (with a certain stately awkwardness, as if 

he were going to walk a minuet) across Holborn, and into Furnival's 

Inn.  At the hotel door, he confided her to the Unlimited head 

chambermaid, and said that while she went up to see her room, he 

would remain below, in case she should wish it exchanged for 

another, or should find that there was anything she wanted.



Rosa's room was airy, clean, comfortable, almost gay.  The 

Unlimited had laid in everything omitted from the very little bag 

(that is to say, everything she could possibly need), and Rosa 

tripped down the great many stairs again, to thank her guardian for 

his thoughtful and affectionate care of her.



'Not at all, my dear,' said Mr. Grewgious, infinitely gratified; 

'it is I who thank you for your charming confidence and for your 

charming company.  Your breakfast will be provided for you in a 

neat, compact, and graceful little sitting-room (appropriate to 

your figure), and I will come to you at ten o'clock in the morning.  

I hope you don't feel very strange indeed, in this strange place.'



'O no, I feel so safe!'



'Yes, you may be sure that the stairs are fire-proof,' said Mr. 

Grewgious, 'and that any outbreak of the devouring element would be 

perceived and suppressed by the watchmen.'



'I did not mean that,' Rosa replied.  'I mean, I feel so safe from 

him.'



'There is a stout gate of iron bars to keep him out,' said Mr. 

Grewgious, smiling; 'and Furnival's is fire-proof, and specially 

watched and lighted, and I live over the way!'  In the stoutness of 

his knight-errantry, he seemed to think the last-named protection 

all sufficient.  In the same spirit he said to the gate-porter as 

he went out, 'If some one staying in the hotel should wish to send 

across the road to me in the night, a crown will be ready for the 

messenger.'  In the same spirit, he walked up and down outside the 

iron gate for the best part of an hour, with some solicitude; 

occasionally looking in between the bars, as if he had laid a dove 

in a high roost in a cage of lions, and had it on his mind that she 

might tumble out.
