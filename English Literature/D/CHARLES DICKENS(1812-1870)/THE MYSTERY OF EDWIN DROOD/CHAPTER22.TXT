MR. TARTAR'S chambers were the neatest, the cleanest, and the best-

ordered chambers ever seen under the sun, moon, and stars.  The 

floors were scrubbed to that extent, that you might have supposed 

the London blacks emancipated for ever, and gone out of the land 

for good.  Every inch of brass-work in Mr. Tartar's possession was 

polished and burnished, till it shone like a brazen mirror.  No 

speck, nor spot, nor spatter soiled the purity of any of Mr. 

Tartar's household gods, large, small, or middle-sized.  His 

sitting-room was like the admiral's cabin, his bath-room was like a 

dairy, his sleeping-chamber, fitted all about with lockers and 

drawers, was like a seedsman's shop; and his nicely-balanced cot 

just stirred in the midst, as if it breathed.  Everything belonging 

to Mr. Tartar had quarters of its own assigned to it:  his maps and 

charts had their quarters; his books had theirs; his brushes had 

theirs; his boots had theirs; his clothes had theirs; his case-

bottles had theirs; his telescopes and other instruments had 

theirs.  Everything was readily accessible.  Shelf, bracket, 

locker, hook, and drawer were equally within reach, and were 

equally contrived with a view to avoiding waste of room, and 

providing some snug inches of stowage for something that would have 

exactly fitted nowhere else.  His gleaming little service of plate 

was so arranged upon his sideboard as that a slack salt-spoon would 

have instantly betrayed itself; his toilet implements were so 

arranged upon his dressing-table as that a toothpick of slovenly 

deportment could have been reported at a glance.  So with the 

curiosities he had brought home from various voyages.  Stuffed, 

dried, repolished, or otherwise preserved, according to their kind; 

birds, fishes, reptiles, arms, articles of dress, shells, seaweeds, 

grasses, or memorials of coral reef; each was displayed in its 

especial place, and each could have been displayed in no better 

place.  Paint and varnish seemed to be kept somewhere out of sight, 

in constant readiness to obliterate stray finger-marks wherever any 

might become perceptible in Mr. Tartar's chambers.  No man-of-war 

was ever kept more spick and span from careless touch.  On this 

bright summer day, a neat awning was rigged over Mr. Tartar's 

flower-garden as only a sailor can rig it, and there was a sea-

going air upon the whole effect, so delightfully complete, that the 

flower-garden might have appertained to stern-windows afloat, and 

the whole concern might have bowled away gallantly with all on 

board, if Mr. Tartar had only clapped to his lips the speaking-

trumpet that was slung in a corner, and given hoarse orders to 

heave the anchor up, look alive there, men, and get all sail upon 

her!



Mr. Tartar doing the honours of this gallant craft was of a piece 

with the rest.  When a man rides an amiable hobby that shies at 

nothing and kicks nobody, it is only agreeable to find him riding 

it with a humorous sense of the droll side of the creature.  When 

the man is a cordial and an earnest man by nature, and withal is 

perfectly fresh and genuine, it may be doubted whether he is ever 

seen to greater advantage than at such a time.  So Rosa would have 

naturally thought (even if she hadn't been conducted over the ship 

with all the homage due to the First Lady of the Admiralty, or 

First Fairy of the Sea), that it was charming to see and hear Mr. 

Tartar half laughing at, and half rejoicing in, his various 

contrivances.  So Rosa would have naturally thought, anyhow, that 

the sunburnt sailor showed to great advantage when, the inspection 

finished, he delicately withdrew out of his admiral's cabin, 

beseeching her to consider herself its Queen, and waving her free 

of his flower-garden with the hand that had had Mr. Crisparkle's 

life in it.



'Helena!  Helena Landless!  Are you there?'



'Who speaks to me?  Not Rosa?'  Then a second handsome face 

appearing.



'Yes, my darling!'



'Why, how did you come here, dearest?'



'I - I don't quite know,' said Rosa with a blush; 'unless I am 

dreaming!'



Why with a blush?  For their two faces were alone with the other 

flowers.  Are blushes among the fruits of the country of the magic 

bean-stalk?



'I am not dreaming,' said Helena, smiling.  'I should take more for 

granted if I were.  How do we come together - or so near together - 

so very unexpectedly?'



Unexpectedly indeed, among the dingy gables and chimney-pots of P. 

J. T.'s connection, and the flowers that had sprung from the salt 

sea.  But Rosa, waking, told in a hurry how they came to be 

together, and all the why and wherefore of that matter.



'And Mr. Crisparkle is here,' said Rosa, in rapid conclusion; 'and, 

could you believe it? long ago he saved his life!'



'I could believe any such thing of Mr. Crisparkle,' returned 

Helena, with a mantling face.



(More blushes in the bean-stalk country!)



'Yes, but it wasn't Crisparkle,' said Rosa, quickly putting in the 

correction.



'I don't understand, love.'



'It was very nice of Mr. Crisparkle to be saved,' said Rosa, 'and 

he couldn't have shown his high opinion of Mr. Tartar more 

expressively.  But it was Mr. Tartar who saved him.'



Helena's dark eyes looked very earnestly at the bright face among 

the leaves, and she asked, in a slower and more thoughtful tone:



'Is Mr. Tartar with you now, dear?'



'No; because he has given up his rooms to me - to us, I mean.  It 

is such a beautiful place!'



'Is it?'



'It is like the inside of the most exquisite ship that ever sailed.  

It is like - it is like - '



'Like a dream?' suggested Helena.



Rosa answered with a little nod, and smelled the flowers.



Helena resumed, after a short pause of silence, during which she 

seemed (or it was Rosa's fancy) to compassionate somebody:  'My 

poor Neville is reading in his own room, the sun being so very 

bright on this side just now.  I think he had better not know that 

you are so near.'



'O, I think so too!' cried Rosa very readily.



'I suppose,' pursued Helena, doubtfully, 'that he must know by-and-

by all you have told me; but I am not sure.  Ask Mr. Crisparkle's 

advice, my darling.  Ask him whether I may tell Neville as much or 

as little of what you have told me as I think best.'



Rosa subsided into her state-cabin, and propounded the question.  

The Minor Canon was for the free exercise of Helena's judgment.



'I thank him very much,' said Helena, when Rosa emerged again with 

her report.  'Ask him whether it would be best to wait until any 

more maligning and pursuing of Neville on the part of this wretch 

shall disclose itself, or to try to anticipate it:  I mean, so far 

as to find out whether any such goes on darkly about us?'



The Minor Canon found this point so difficult to give a confident 

opinion on, that, after two or three attempts and failures, he 

suggested a reference to Mr. Grewgious.  Helena acquiescing, he 

betook himself (with a most unsuccessful assumption of lounging 

indifference) across the quadrangle to P. J. T.'s, and stated it.  

Mr. Grewgious held decidedly to the general principle, that if you 

could steal a march upon a brigand or a wild beast, you had better 

do it; and he also held decidedly to the special case, that John 

Jasper was a brigand and a wild beast in combination.



Thus advised, Mr. Crisparkle came back again and reported to Rosa, 

who in her turn reported to Helena.  She now steadily pursuing her 

train of thought at her window, considered thereupon.



'We may count on Mr. Tartar's readiness to help us, Rosa?' she 

inquired.



O yes!  Rosa shyly thought so.  O yes, Rosa shyly believed she 

could almost answer for it.  But should she ask Mr. Crisparkle?  'I 

think your authority on the point as good as his, my dear,' said 

Helena, sedately, 'and you needn't disappear again for that.'  Odd 

of Helena!



'You see, Neville,' Helena pursued after more reflection, 'knows no 

one else here:  he has not so much as exchanged a word with any one 

else here.  If Mr. Tartar would call to see him openly and often; 

if he would spare a minute for the purpose, frequently; if he would 

even do so, almost daily; something might come of it.'



'Something might come of it, dear?' repeated Rosa, surveying her 

friend's beauty with a highly perplexed face.  'Something might?'



'If Neville's movements are really watched, and if the purpose 

really is to isolate him from all friends and acquaintance and wear 

his daily life out grain by grain (which would seem to be the 

threat to you), does it not appear likely,' said Helena, 'that his 

enemy would in some way communicate with Mr. Tartar to warn him off 

from Neville?  In which case, we might not only know the fact, but 

might know from Mr. Tartar what the terms of the communication 

were.'



'I see!' cried Rosa.  And immediately darted into her state-cabin 

again.



Presently her pretty face reappeared, with a greatly heightened 

colour, and she said that she had told Mr. Crisparkle, and that Mr. 

Crisparkle had fetched in Mr. Tartar, and that Mr. Tartar - 'who is 

waiting now, in case you want him,' added Rosa, with a half look 

back, and in not a little confusion between the inside of the 

state-cabin and out - had declared his readiness to act as she had 

suggested, and to enter on his task that very day.



'I thank him from my heart,' said Helena.  'Pray tell him so.'



Again not a little confused between the Flower-garden and the 

Cabin, Rosa dipped in with her message, and dipped out again with 

more assurances from Mr. Tartar, and stood wavering in a divided 

state between Helena and him, which proved that confusion is not 

always necessarily awkward, but may sometimes present a very 

pleasant appearance.



'And now, darling,' said Helena, 'we will be mindful of the caution 

that has restricted us to this interview for the present, and will 

part.  I hear Neville moving too.  Are you going back?'



'To Miss Twinkleton's?' asked Rosa.



'Yes.'



'O, I could never go there any more.  I couldn't indeed, after that 

dreadful interview!' said Rosa.



'Then where ARE you going, pretty one?'



'Now I come to think of it, I don't know,' said Rosa.  'I have 

settled nothing at all yet, but my guardian will take care of me.  

Don't be uneasy, dear.  I shall be sure to be somewhere.'



(It did seem likely.)



'And I shall hear of my Rosebud from Mr. Tartar?' inquired Helena.



'Yes, I suppose so; from - ' Rosa looked back again in a flutter, 

instead of supplying the name.  'But tell me one thing before we 

part, dearest Helena.  Tell me - that you are sure, sure, sure, I 

couldn't help it.'



'Help it, love?'



'Help making him malicious and revengeful.  I couldn't hold any 

terms with him, could I?'



'You know how I love you, darling,' answered Helena, with 

indignation; 'but I would sooner see you dead at his wicked feet.'



'That's a great comfort to me!  And you will tell your poor brother 

so, won't you?  And you will give him my remembrance and my 

sympathy?  And you will ask him not to hate me?'



With a mournful shake of the head, as if that would be quite a 

superfluous entreaty, Helena lovingly kissed her two hands to her 

friend, and her friend's two hands were kissed to her; and then she 

saw a third hand (a brown one) appear among the flowers and leaves, 

and help her friend out of sight.



The refection that Mr. Tartar produced in the Admiral's Cabin by 

merely touching the spring knob of a locker and the handle of a 

drawer, was a dazzling enchanted repast.  Wonderful macaroons, 

glittering liqueurs, magically-preserved tropical spices, and 

jellies of celestial tropical fruits, displayed themselves 

profusely at an instant's notice.  But Mr. Tartar could not make 

time stand still; and time, with his hard-hearted fleetness, strode 

on so fast, that Rosa was obliged to come down from the bean-stalk 

country to earth and her guardian's chambers.



'And now, my dear,' said Mr. Grewgious, 'what is to be done next?  

To put the same thought in another form; what is to be done with 

you?'



Rosa could only look apologetically sensible of being very much in 

her own way and in everybody else's.  Some passing idea of living, 

fireproof, up a good many stairs in Furnival's Inn for the rest of 

her life, was the only thing in the nature of a plan that occurred 

to her.



'It has come into my thoughts,' said Mr. Grewgious, 'that as the 

respected lady, Miss Twinkleton, occasionally repairs to London in 

the recess, with the view of extending her connection, and being 

available for interviews with metropolitan parents, if any - 

whether, until we have time in which to turn ourselves round, we 

might invite Miss Twinkleton to come and stay with you for a 

month?'



'Stay where, sir?'



'Whether,' explained Mr. Grewgious, 'we might take a furnished 

lodging in town for a month, and invite Miss Twinkleton to assume 

the charge of you in it for that period?'



'And afterwards?' hinted Rosa.



'And afterwards,' said Mr. Grewgious, 'we should be no worse off 

than we are now.'



'I think that might smooth the way,' assented Rosa.



'Then let us,' said Mr. Grewgious, rising, 'go and look for a 

furnished lodging.  Nothing could be more acceptable to me than the 

sweet presence of last evening, for all the remaining evenings of 

my existence; but these are not fit surroundings for a young lady.  

Let us set out in quest of adventures, and look for a furnished 

lodging.  In the meantime, Mr. Crisparkle here, about to return 

home immediately, will no doubt kindly see Miss Twinkleton, and 

invite that lady to co-operate in our plan.'



Mr. Crisparkle, willingly accepting the commission, took his 

departure; Mr. Grewgious and his ward set forth on their 

expedition.



As Mr. Grewgious's idea of looking at a furnished lodging was to 

get on the opposite side of the street to a house with a suitable 

bill in the window, and stare at it; and then work his way 

tortuously to the back of the house, and stare at that; and then 

not go in, but make similar trials of another house, with the same 

result; their progress was but slow.  At length he bethought 

himself of a widowed cousin, divers times removed, of Mr. 

Bazzard's, who had once solicited his influence in the lodger 

world, and who lived in Southampton Street, Bloomsbury Square.  

This lady's name, stated in uncompromising capitals of considerable 

size on a brass door-plate, and yet not lucidly as to sex or 

condition, was BILLICKIN.



Personal faintness, and an overpowering personal candour, were the 

distinguishing features of Mrs. Billickin's organisation.  She came 

languishing out of her own exclusive back parlour, with the air of 

having been expressly brought-to for the purpose, from an 

accumulation of several swoons.



'I hope I see you well, sir,' said Mrs. Billickin, recognising her 

visitor with a bend.



'Thank you, quite well.  And you, ma'am?' returned Mr. Grewgious.



'I am as well,' said Mrs. Billickin, becoming aspirational with 

excess of faintness, 'as I hever ham.'



'My ward and an elderly lady,' said Mr. Grewgious, 'wish to find a 

genteel lodging for a month or so.  Have you any apartments 

available, ma'am?'



'Mr. Grewgious,' returned Mrs. Billickin, 'I will not deceive you; 

far from it.  I HAVE apartments available.'



This with the air of adding:  'Convey me to the stake, if you will; 

but while I live, I will be candid.'



'And now, what apartments, ma'am?' asked Mr. Grewgious, cosily.  To 

tame a certain severity apparent on the part of Mrs. Billickin.



'There is this sitting-room - which, call it what you will, it is 

the front parlour, Miss,' said Mrs. Billickin, impressing Rosa into 

the conversation:  'the back parlour being what I cling to and 

never part with; and there is two bedrooms at the top of the 'ouse 

with gas laid on.  I do not tell you that your bedroom floors is 

firm, for firm they are not.  The gas-fitter himself allowed, that 

to make a firm job, he must go right under your jistes, and it were 

not worth the outlay as a yearly tenant so to do.  The piping is 

carried above your jistes, and it is best that it should be made 

known to you.'



Mr. Grewgious and Rosa exchanged looks of some dismay, though they 

had not the least idea what latent horrors this carriage of the 

piping might involve.  Mrs. Billickin put her hand to her heart, as 

having eased it of a load.



'Well!  The roof is all right, no doubt,' said Mr. Grewgious, 

plucking up a little.



'Mr. Grewgious,' returned Mrs. Billickin, 'if I was to tell you, 

sir, that to have nothink above you is to have a floor above you, I 

should put a deception upon you which I will not do.  No, sir.  

Your slates WILL rattle loose at that elewation in windy weather, 

do your utmost, best or worst!  I defy you, sir, be you what you 

may, to keep your slates tight, try how you can.'  Here Mrs. 

Billickin, having been warm with Mr. Grewgious, cooled a little, 

not to abuse the moral power she held over him.  'Consequent,' 

proceeded Mrs. Billickin, more mildly, but still firmly in her 

incorruptible candour:  'consequent it would be worse than of no 

use for me to trapse and travel up to the top of the 'ouse with 

you, and for you to say, "Mrs. Billickin, what stain do I notice in 

the ceiling, for a stain I do consider it?" and for me to answer, 

"I do not understand you, sir."  No, sir, I will not be so 

underhand.  I DO understand you before you pint it out.  It is the 

wet, sir.  It do come in, and it do not come in.  You may lay dry 

there half your lifetime; but the time will come, and it is best 

that you should know it, when a dripping sop would be no name for 

you.'



Mr. Grewgious looked much disgraced by being prefigured in this 

pickle.



'Have you any other apartments, ma'am?' he asked.



'Mr. Grewgious,' returned Mrs. Billickin, with much solemnity, 'I 

have.  You ask me have I, and my open and my honest answer air, I 

have.  The first and second floors is wacant, and sweet rooms.'



'Come, come!  There's nothing against THEM,' said Mr. Grewgious, 

comforting himself.



'Mr. Grewgious,' replied Mrs. Billickin, 'pardon me, there is the 

stairs.  Unless your mind is prepared for the stairs, it will lead 

to inevitable disappointment.  You cannot, Miss,' said Mrs. 

Billickin, addressing Rosa reproachfully, 'place a first floor, and 

far less a second, on the level footing 'of a parlour.  No, you 

cannot do it, Miss, it is beyond your power, and wherefore try?'



Mrs. Billickin put it very feelingly, as if Rosa had shown a 

headstrong determination to hold the untenable position.



'Can we see these rooms, ma'am?' inquired her guardian.



'Mr. Grewgious,' returned Mrs. Billickin, 'you can.  I will not 

disguise it from you, sir; you can.'



Mrs. Billickin then sent into her back parlour for her shawl (it 

being a state fiction, dating from immemorial antiquity, that she 

could never go anywhere without being wrapped up), and having been 

enrolled by her attendant, led the way.  She made various genteel 

pauses on the stairs for breath, and clutched at her heart in the 

drawing-room as if it had very nearly got loose, and she had caught 

it in the act of taking wing.



'And the second floor?' said Mr. Grewgious, on finding the first 

satisfactory.



'Mr. Grewgious,' replied Mrs. Billickin, turning upon him with 

ceremony, as if the time had now come when a distinct understanding 

on a difficult point must be arrived at, and a solemn confidence 

established, 'the second floor is over this.'



'Can we see that too, ma'am?'



'Yes, sir,' returned Mrs. Billickin, 'it is open as the day.'



That also proving satisfactory, Mr. Grewgious retired into a window 

with Rosa for a few words of consultation, and then asking for pen 

and ink, sketched out a line or two of agreement.  In the meantime 

Mrs. Billickin took a seat, and delivered a kind of Index to, or 

Abstract of, the general question.



'Five-and-forty shillings per week by the month certain at the time 

of year,' said Mrs. Billickin, 'is only reasonable to both parties.  

It is not Bond Street nor yet St. James's Palace; but it is not 

pretended that it is.  Neither is it attempted to be denied - for 

why should it? - that the Arching leads to a mews.  Mewses must 

exist.  Respecting attendance; two is kep', at liberal wages.  

Words HAS arisen as to tradesmen, but dirty shoes on fresh hearth-

stoning was attributable, and no wish for a commission on your 

orders.  Coals is either BY the fire, or PER the scuttle.'  She 

emphasised the prepositions as marking a subtle but immense 

difference.  'Dogs is not viewed with favour.  Besides litter, they 

gets stole, and sharing suspicions is apt to creep in, and 

unpleasantness takes place.'



By this time Mr. Grewgious had his agreement-lines, and his 

earnest-money, ready.  'I have signed it for the ladies, ma'am,' he 

said, 'and you'll have the goodness to sign it for yourself, 

Christian and Surname, there, if you please.'



'Mr. Grewgious,' said Mrs. Billickin in a new burst of candour, 

'no, sir!  You must excuse the Christian name.'



Mr. Grewgious stared at her.



'The door-plate is used as a protection,' said Mrs. Billickin, 'and 

acts as such, and go from it I will not.'



Mr. Grewgious stared at Rosa.



'No, Mr. Grewgious, you must excuse me.  So long as this 'ouse is 

known indefinite as Billickin's, and so long as it is a doubt with 

the riff-raff where Billickin may be hidin', near the street-door 

or down the airy, and what his weight and size, so long I feel 

safe.  But commit myself to a solitary female statement, no, Miss!  

Nor would you for a moment wish,' said Mrs. Billickin, with a 

strong sense of injury, 'to take that advantage of your sex, if you 

were not brought to it by inconsiderate example.'



Rosa reddening as if she had made some most disgraceful attempt to 

overreach the good lady, besought Mr. Grewgious to rest content 

with any signature.  And accordingly, in a baronial way, the sign-

manual BILLICKIN got appended to the document.



Details were then settled for taking possession on the next day but 

one, when Miss Twinkleton might be reasonably expected; and Rosa 

went back to Furnival's Inn on her guardian's arm.



Behold Mr. Tartar walking up and down Furnival's Inn, checking 

himself when he saw them coming, and advancing towards them!



'It occurred to me,' hinted Mr. Tartar, 'that we might go up the 

river, the weather being so delicious and the tide serving.  I have 

a boat of my own at the Temple Stairs.'



'I have not been up the river for this many a day,' said Mr. 

Grewgious, tempted.



'I was never up the river,' added Rosa.



Within half an hour they were setting this matter right by going up 

the river.  The tide was running with them, the afternoon was 

charming.  Mr. Tartar's boat was perfect.  Mr. Tartar and Lobley 

(Mr. Tartar's man) pulled a pair of oars.  Mr. Tartar had a yacht, 

it seemed, lying somewhere down by Greenhithe; and Mr. Tartar's man 

had charge of this yacht, and was detached upon his present 

service.  He was a jolly-favoured man, with tawny hair and 

whiskers, and a big red face.  He was the dead image of the sun in 

old woodcuts, his hair and whiskers answering for rays all around 

him.  Resplendent in the bow of the boat, he was a shining sight, 

with a man-of-war's man's shirt on - or off, according to opinion - 

and his arms and breast tattooed all sorts of patterns.  Lobley 

seemed to take it easily, and so did Mr. Tartar; yet their oars 

bent as they pulled, and the boat bounded under them.  Mr. Tartar 

talked as if he were doing nothing, to Rosa who was really doing 

nothing, and to Mr. Grewgious who was doing this much that he 

steered all wrong; but what did that matter, when a turn of Mr. 

Tartar's skilful wrist, or a mere grin of Mr. Lobley's over the 

bow, put all to rights!  The tide bore them on in the gayest and 

most sparkling manner, until they stopped to dine in some ever-

lastingly-green garden, needing no matter-of-fact identification 

here; and then the tide obligingly turned - being devoted to that 

party alone for that day; and as they floated idly among some 

osier-beds, Rosa tried what she could do in the rowing way, and 

came off splendidly, being much assisted; and Mr. Grewgious tried 

what he could do, and came off on his back, doubled up with an oar 

under his chin, being not assisted at all.  Then there was an 

interval of rest under boughs (such rest!) what time Mr. Lobley 

mopped, and, arranging cushions, stretchers, and the like, danced 

the tight-rope the whole length of the boat like a man to whom 

shoes were a superstition and stockings slavery; and then came the 

sweet return among delicious odours of limes in bloom, and musical 

ripplings; and, all too soon, the great black city cast its shadow 

on the waters, and its dark bridges spanned them as death spans 

life, and the everlastingly-green garden seemed to be left for 

everlasting, unregainable and far away.



'Cannot people get through life without gritty stages, I wonder?' 

Rosa thought next day, when the town was very gritty again, and 

everything had a strange and an uncomfortable appearance of seeming 

to wait for something that wouldn't come.  NO.  She began to think, 

that, now the Cloisterham school-days had glided past and gone, the 

gritty stages would begin to set in at intervals and make 

themselves wearily known!



Yet what did Rosa expect?  Did she expect Miss Twinkleton?  Miss 

Twinkleton duly came.  Forth from her back parlour issued the 

Billickin to receive Miss Twinkleton, and War was in the 

Billickin's eye from that fell moment.



Miss Twinkleton brought a quantity of luggage with her, having all 

Rosa's as well as her own.  The Billickin took it ill that Miss 

Twinkleton's mind, being sorely disturbed by this luggage, failed 

to take in her personal identity with that clearness of perception 

which was due to its demands.  Stateliness mounted her gloomy 

throne upon the Billickin's brow in consequence.  And when Miss 

Twinkleton, in agitation taking stock of her trunks and packages, 

of which she had seventeen, particularly counted in the Billickin 

herself as number eleven, the B. found it necessary to repudiate.



'Things cannot too soon be put upon the footing,' said she, with a 

candour so demonstrative as to be almost obtrusive, 'that the 

person of the 'ouse is not a box nor yet a bundle, nor a carpet-

bag.  No, I am 'ily obleeged to you, Miss Twinkleton, nor yet a 

beggar.'



This last disclaimer had reference to Miss Twinkleton's 

distractedly pressing two-and-sixpence on her, instead of the 

cabman.



Thus cast off, Miss Twinkleton wildly inquired, 'which gentleman' 

was to be paid?  There being two gentlemen in that position (Miss 

Twinkleton having arrived with two cabs), each gentleman on being 

paid held forth his two-and-sixpence on the flat of his open hand, 

and, with a speechless stare and a dropped jaw, displayed his wrong 

to heaven and earth.  Terrified by this alarming spectacle, Miss 

Twinkleton placed another shilling in each hand; at the same time 

appealing to the law in flurried accents, and recounting her 

luggage this time with the two gentlemen in, who caused the total 

to come out complicated.  Meanwhile the two gentlemen, each looking 

very hard at the last shilling grumblingly, as if it might become 

eighteen-pence if he kept his eyes on it, descended the doorsteps, 

ascended their carriages, and drove away, leaving Miss Twinkleton 

on a bonnet-box in tears.



The Billickin beheld this manifestation of weakness without 

sympathy, and gave directions for 'a young man to be got in' to 

wrestle with the luggage.  When that gladiator had disappeared from 

the arena, peace ensued, and the new lodgers dined.



But the Billickin had somehow come to the knowledge that Miss 

Twinkleton kept a school.  The leap from that knowledge to the 

inference that Miss Twinkleton set herself to teach HER something, 

was easy.  'But you don't do it,' soliloquised the Billickin; 'I am 

not your pupil, whatever she,' meaning Rosa, 'may be, poor thing!'



Miss Twinkleton, on the other hand, having changed her dress and 

recovered her spirits, was animated by a bland desire to improve 

the occasion in all ways, and to be as serene a model as possible.  

In a happy compromise between her two states of existence, she had 

already become, with her workbasket before her, the equably 

vivacious companion with a slight judicious flavouring of 

information, when the Billickin announced herself.



'I will not hide from you, ladies,' said the B., enveloped in the 

shawl of state, 'for it is not my character to hide neither my 

motives nor my actions, that I take the liberty to look in upon you 

to express a 'ope that your dinner was to your liking.  Though not 

Professed but Plain, still her wages should be a sufficient object 

to her to stimilate to soar above mere roast and biled.'



'We dined very well indeed,' said Rosa, 'thank you.'



'Accustomed,' said Miss Twinkleton with a gracious air, which to 

the jealous ears of the Billickin seemed to add 'my good woman' - 

'accustomed to a liberal and nutritious, yet plain and salutary 

diet, we have found no reason to bemoan our absence from the 

ancient city, and the methodical household, in which the quiet 

routine of our lot has been hitherto cast.'



'I did think it well to mention to my cook,' observed the Billickin 

with a gush of candour, 'which I 'ope you will agree with, Miss 

Twinkleton, was a right precaution, that the young lady being used 

to what we should consider here but poor diet, had better be 

brought forward by degrees.  For, a rush from scanty feeding to 

generous feeding, and from what you may call messing to what you 

may call method, do require a power of constitution which is not 

often found in youth, particular when undermined by boarding-

school!'



It will be seen that the Billickin now openly pitted herself 

against Miss Twinkleton, as one whom she had fully ascertained to 

be her natural enemy.



'Your remarks,' returned Miss Twinkleton, from a remote moral 

eminence, 'are well meant, I have no doubt; but you will permit me 

to observe that they develop a mistaken view of the subject, which 

can only be imputed to your extreme want of accurate information.'



'My informiation,' retorted the Billickin, throwing in an extra 

syllable for the sake of emphasis at once polite and powerful - 'my 

informiation, Miss Twinkleton, were my own experience, which I 

believe is usually considered to be good guidance.  But whether so 

or not, I was put in youth to a very genteel boarding-school, the 

mistress being no less a lady than yourself, of about your own age 

or it may be some years younger, and a poorness of blood flowed 

from the table which has run through my life.'



'Very likely,' said Miss Twinkleton, still from her distant 

eminence; 'and very much to be deplored. - Rosa, my dear, how are 

you getting on with your work?'



'Miss Twinkleton,' resumed the Billickin, in a courtly manner, 

'before retiring on the 'int, as a lady should, I wish to ask of 

yourself, as a lady, whether I am to consider that my words is 

doubted?'



'I am not aware on what ground you cherish such a supposition,' 

began Miss Twinkleton, when the Billickin neatly stopped her.



'Do not, if you please, put suppositions betwixt my lips where none 

such have been imparted by myself.  Your flow of words is great, 

Miss Twinkleton, and no doubt is expected from you by your pupils, 

and no doubt is considered worth the money.  NO doubt, I am sure.  

But not paying for flows of words, and not asking to be favoured 

with them here, I wish to repeat my question.'



'If you refer to the poverty of your circulation,' began Miss 

Twinkleton, when again the Billickin neatly stopped her.



'I have used no such expressions.'



'If you refer, then, to the poorness of your blood - '



'Brought upon me,' stipulated the Billickin, expressly, 'at a 

boarding-school - '



'Then,' resumed Miss Twinkleton, 'all I can say is, that I am bound 

to believe, on your asseveration, that it is very poor indeed.  I 

cannot forbear adding, that if that unfortunate circumstance 

influences your conversation, it is much to be lamented, and it is 

eminently desirable that your blood were richer. - Rosa, my dear, 

how are you getting on with your work?'



'Hem!  Before retiring, Miss,' proclaimed the Billickin to Rosa, 

loftily cancelling Miss Twinkleton, 'I should wish it to be 

understood between yourself and me that my transactions in future 

is with you alone.  I know no elderly lady here, Miss, none older 

than yourself.'



'A highly desirable arrangement, Rosa my dear,' observed Miss 

Twinkleton.



'It is not, Miss,' said the Billickin, with a sarcastic smile, 

'that I possess the Mill I have heard of, in which old single 

ladies could be ground up young (what a gift it would be to some of 

us), but that I limit myself to you totally.'



'When I have any desire to communicate a request to the person of 

the house, Rosa my dear,' observed Miss Twinkleton with majestic 

cheerfulness, 'I will make it known to you, and you will kindly 

undertake, I am sure, that it is conveyed to the proper quarter.'



'Good-evening, Miss,' said the Billickin, at once affectionately 

and distantly.  'Being alone in my eyes, I wish you good-evening 

with best wishes, and do not find myself drove, I am truly 'appy to 

say, into expressing my contempt for an indiwidual, unfortunately 

for yourself, belonging to you.'



The Billickin gracefully withdrew with this parting speech, and 

from that time Rosa occupied the restless position of shuttlecock 

between these two battledores.  Nothing could be done without a 

smart match being played out.  Thus, on the daily-arising question 

of dinner, Miss Twinkleton would say, the three being present 

together:



'Perhaps, my love, you will consult with the person of the house, 

whether she can procure us a lamb's fry; or, failing that, a roast 

fowl.'



On which the Billickin would retort (Rosa not having spoken a 

word), 'If you was better accustomed to butcher's meat, Miss, you 

would not entertain the idea of a lamb's fry.  Firstly, because 

lambs has long been sheep, and secondly, because there is such 

things as killing-days, and there is not.  As to roast fowls, Miss, 

why you must be quite surfeited with roast fowls, letting alone 

your buying, when you market for yourself, the agedest of poultry 

with the scaliest of legs, quite as if you was accustomed to 

picking 'em out for cheapness.  Try a little inwention, Miss.  Use 

yourself to 'ousekeeping a bit.  Come now, think of somethink 

else.'



To this encouragement, offered with the indulgent toleration of a 

wise and liberal expert, Miss Twinkleton would rejoin, reddening:



'Or, my dear, you might propose to the person of the house a duck.'



'Well, Miss!' the Billickin would exclaim (still no word being 

spoken by Rosa), 'you do surprise me when you speak of ducks!  Not 

to mention that they're getting out of season and very dear, it 

really strikes to my heart to see you have a duck; for the breast, 

which is the only delicate cuts in a duck, always goes in a 

direction which I cannot imagine where, and your own plate comes 

down so miserably skin-and-bony!  Try again, Miss.  Think more of 

yourself, and less of others.  A dish of sweetbreads now, or a bit 

of mutton.  Something at which you can get your equal chance.'



Occasionally the game would wax very brisk indeed, and would be 

kept up with a smartness rendering such an encounter as this quite 

tame.  But the Billickin almost invariably made by far the higher 

score; and would come in with side hits of the most unexpected and 

extraordinary description, when she seemed without a chance.



All this did not improve the gritty state of things in London, or 

the air that London had acquired in Rosa's eyes of waiting for 

something that never came.  Tired of working, and conversing with 

Miss Twinkleton, she suggested working and reading:  to which Miss 

Twinkleton readily assented, as an admirable reader, of tried 

powers.  But Rosa soon made the discovery that Miss Twinkleton 

didn't read fairly.  She cut the love-scenes, interpolated passages 

in praise of female celibacy, and was guilty of other glaring pious 

frauds.  As an instance in point, take the glowing passage:  'Ever 

dearest and best adored, - said Edward, clasping the dear head to 

his breast, and drawing the silken hair through his caressing 

fingers, from which he suffered it to fall like golden rain, - ever 

dearest and best adored, let us fly from the unsympathetic world 

and the sterile coldness of the stony-hearted, to the rich warm 

Paradise of Trust and Love.'  Miss Twinkleton's fraudulent version 

tamely ran thus:  'Ever engaged to me with the consent of our 

parents on both sides, and the approbation of the silver-haired 

rector of the district, - said Edward, respectfully raising to his 

lips the taper fingers so skilful in embroidery, tambour, crochet, 

and other truly feminine arts, - let me call on thy papa ere to-

morrow's dawn has sunk into the west, and propose a suburban 

establishment, lowly it may be, but within our means, where he will 

be always welcome as an evening guest, and where every arrangement 

shall invest economy, and constant interchange of scholastic 

acquirements with the attributes of the ministering angel to 

domestic bliss.'



As the days crept on and nothing happened, the neighbours began to 

say that the pretty girl at Billickin's, who looked so wistfully 

and so much out of the gritty windows of the drawing-room, seemed 

to be losing her spirits.  The pretty girl might have lost them but 

for the accident of lighting on some books of voyages and sea-

adventure.  As a compensation against their romance, Miss 

Twinkleton, reading aloud, made the most of all the latitudes and 

longitudes, bearings, winds, currents, offsets, and other 

statistics (which she felt to be none the less improving because 

they expressed nothing whatever to her); while Rosa, listening 

intently, made the most of what was nearest to her heart.  So they 

both did better than before.
