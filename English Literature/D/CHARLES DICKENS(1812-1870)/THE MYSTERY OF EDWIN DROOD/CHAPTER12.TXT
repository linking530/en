WHEN Mr. Sapsea has nothing better to do, towards evening, and 

finds the contemplation of his own profundity becoming a little 

monotonous in spite of the vastness of the subject, he often takes 

an airing in the Cathedral Close and thereabout.  He likes to pass 

the churchyard with a swelling air of proprietorship, and to 

encourage in his breast a sort of benignant-landlord feeling, in 

that he has been bountiful towards that meritorious tenant, Mrs. 

Sapsea, and has publicly given her a prize.  He likes to see a 

stray face or two looking in through the railings, and perhaps 

reading his inscription.  Should he meet a stranger coming from the 

churchyard with a quick step, he is morally convinced that the 

stranger is 'with a blush retiring,' as monumentally directed.



Mr. Sapsea's importance has received enhancement, for he has become 

Mayor of Cloisterham.  Without mayors, and many of them, it cannot 

be disputed that the whole framework of society - Mr. Sapsea is 

confident that he invented that forcible figure - would fall to 

pieces.  Mayors have been knighted for 'going up' with addresses:  

explosive machines intrepidly discharging shot and shell into the 

English Grammar.  Mr. Sapsea may 'go up' with an address.  Rise, 

Sir Thomas Sapsea!  Of such is the salt of the earth.



Mr. Sapsea has improved the acquaintance of Mr. Jasper, since their 

first meeting to partake of port, epitaph, backgammon, beef, and 

salad.  Mr. Sapsea has been received at the gatehouse with kindred 

hospitality; and on that occasion Mr. Jasper seated himself at the 

piano, and sang to him, tickling his ears - figuratively - long 

enough to present a considerable area for tickling.  What Mr. 

Sapsea likes in that young man is, that he is always ready to 

profit by the wisdom of his elders, and that he is sound, sir, at 

the core.  In proof of which, he sang to Mr. Sapsea that evening, 

no kickshaw ditties, favourites with national enemies, but gave him 

the genuine George the Third home-brewed; exhorting him (as 'my 

brave boys') to reduce to a smashed condition all other islands but 

this island, and all continents, peninsulas, isthmuses, 

promontories, and other geographical forms of land soever, besides 

sweeping the seas in all directions.  In short, he rendered it 

pretty clear that Providence made a distinct mistake in originating 

so small a nation of hearts of oak, and so many other verminous 

peoples.



Mr. Sapsea, walking slowly this moist evening near the churchyard 

with his hands behind him, on the look-out for a blushing and 

retiring stranger, turns a corner, and comes instead into the 

goodly presence of the Dean, conversing with the Verger and Mr. 

Jasper.  Mr. Sapsea makes his obeisance, and is instantly stricken 

far more ecclesiastical than any Archbishop of York or Canterbury.



'You are evidently going to write a book about us, Mr. Jasper,' 

quoth the Dean; 'to write a book about us.  Well!  We are very 

ancient, and we ought to make a good book.  We are not so richly 

endowed in possessions as in age; but perhaps you will put THAT in 

your book, among other things, and call attention to our wrongs.'



Mr. Tope, as in duty bound, is greatly entertained by this.



'I really have no intention at all, sir,' replies Jasper, 'of 

turning author or archaeologist.  It is but a whim of mine.  And 

even for my whim, Mr. Sapsea here is more accountable than I am.'



'How so, Mr. Mayor?' says the Dean, with a nod of good-natured 

recognition of his Fetch.  'How is that, Mr. Mayor?'



'I am not aware,' Mr. Sapsea remarks, looking about him for 

information, 'to what the Very Reverend the Dean does me the honour 

of referring.'  And then falls to studying his original in minute 

points of detail.



'Durdles,' Mr. Tope hints.



'Ay!' the Dean echoes; 'Durdles, Durdles!'



'The truth is, sir,' explains Jasper, 'that my curiosity in the man 

was first really stimulated by Mr. Sapsea.  Mr. Sapsea's knowledge 

of mankind and power of drawing out whatever is recluse or odd 

around him, first led to my bestowing a second thought upon the 

man:  though of course I had met him constantly about.  You would 

not be surprised by this, Mr. Dean, if you had seen Mr. Sapsea deal 

with him in his own parlour, as I did.'



'O!' cries Sapsea, picking up the ball thrown to him with ineffable 

complacency and pomposity; 'yes, yes.  The Very Reverend the Dean 

refers to that?  Yes.  I happened to bring Durdles and Mr. Jasper 

together.  I regard Durdles as a Character.'



'A character, Mr. Sapsea, that with a few skilful touches you turn 

inside out,' says Jasper.



'Nay, not quite that,' returns the lumbering auctioneer.  'I may 

have a little influence over him, perhaps; and a little insight 

into his character, perhaps.  The Very Reverend the Dean will 

please to bear in mind that I have seen the world.'  Here Mr. 

Sapsea gets a little behind the Dean, to inspect his coat-buttons.



'Well!' says the Dean, looking about him to see what has become of 

his copyist:  'I hope, Mr. Mayor, you will use your study and 

knowledge of Durdles to the good purpose of exhorting him not to 

break our worthy and respected Choir-Master's neck; we cannot 

afford it; his head and voice are much too valuable to us.'



Mr. Tope is again highly entertained, and, having fallen into 

respectful convulsions of laughter, subsides into a deferential 

murmur, importing that surely any gentleman would deem it a 

pleasure and an honour to have his neck broken, in return for such 

a compliment from such a source.



'I will take it upon myself, sir,' observes Sapsea loftily, 'to 

answer for Mr. Jasper's neck.  I will tell Durdles to be careful of 

it.  He will mind what I say.  How is it at present endangered?' he 

inquires, looking about him with magnificent patronage.



'Only by my making a moonlight expedition with Durdles among the 

tombs, vaults, towers, and ruins,' returns Jasper.  'You remember 

suggesting, when you brought us together, that, as a lover of the 

picturesque, it might be worth my while?'



'I remember!' replies the auctioneer.  And the solemn idiot really 

believes that he does remember.



'Profiting by your hint,' pursues Jasper, 'I have had some day-

rambles with the extraordinary old fellow, and we are to make a 

moonlight hole-and-corner exploration to-night.'



'And here he is,' says the Dean.



Durdles with his dinner-bundle in his hand, is indeed beheld 

slouching towards them.  Slouching nearer, and perceiving the Dean, 

he pulls off his hat, and is slouching away with it under his arm, 

when Mr. Sapsea stops him.



'Mind you take care of my friend,' is the injunction Mr. Sapsea 

lays upon him.



'What friend o' yourn is dead?' asks Durdles.  'No orders has come 

in for any friend o' yourn.'



'I mean my live friend there.'



'O! him?' says Durdles.  'He can take care of himself, can Mister 

Jarsper.'



'But do you take care of him too,' says Sapsea.



Whom Durdles (there being command in his tone) surlily surveys from 

head to foot.



'With submission to his Reverence the Dean, if you'll mind what 

concerns you, Mr. Sapsea, Durdles he'll mind what concerns him.'



'You're out of temper,' says Mr. Sapsea, winking to the company to 

observe how smoothly he will manage him.  'My friend concerns me, 

and Mr. Jasper is my friend.  And you are my friend.'



'Don't you get into a bad habit of boasting,' retorts Durdles, with 

a grave cautionary nod.  'It'll grow upon you.'



'You are out of temper,' says Sapsea again; reddening, but again 

sinking to the company.



'I own to it,' returns Durdles; 'I don't like liberties.'



Mr. Sapsea winks a third wink to the company, as who should say:  

'I think you will agree with me that I have settled HIS business;' 

and stalks out of the controversy.



Durdles then gives the Dean a good evening, and adding, as he puts 

his hat on, 'You'll find me at home, Mister Jarsper, as agreed, 

when you want me; I'm a-going home to clean myself,' soon slouches 

out of sight.  This going home to clean himself is one of the man's 

incomprehensible compromises with inexorable facts; he, and his 

hat, and his boots, and his clothes, never showing any trace of 

cleaning, but being uniformly in one condition of dust and grit.



The lamplighter now dotting the quiet Close with specks of light, 

and running at a great rate up and down his little ladder with that 

object - his little ladder under the sacred shadow of whose 

inconvenience generations had grown up, and which all Cloisterham 

would have stood aghast at the idea of abolishing - the Dean 

withdraws to his dinner, Mr. Tope to his tea, and Mr. Jasper to his 

piano.  There, with no light but that of the fire, he sits chanting 

choir-music in a low and beautiful voice, for two or three hours; 

in short, until it has been for some time dark, and the moon is 

about to rise.



Then he closes his piano softly, softly changes his coat for a pea-

jacket, with a goodly wicker-cased bottle in its largest pocket, 

and putting on a low-crowned, flap-brimmed hat, goes softly out.  

Why does he move so softly to-night?  No outward reason is apparent 

for it.  Can there be any sympathetic reason crouching darkly 

within him?



Repairing to Durdles's unfinished house, or hole in the city wall, 

and seeing a light within it, he softly picks his course among the 

gravestones, monuments, and stony lumber of the yard, already 

touched here and there, sidewise, by the rising moon.  The two 

journeymen have left their two great saws sticking in their blocks 

of stone; and two skeleton journeymen out of the Dance of Death 

might be grinning in the shadow of their sheltering sentry-boxes, 

about to slash away at cutting out the gravestones of the next two 

people destined to die in Cloisterham.  Likely enough, the two 

think little of that now, being alive, and perhaps merry.  Curious, 

to make a guess at the two; - or say one of the two!



'Ho!  Durdles!'



The light moves, and he appears with it at the door.  He would seem 

to have been 'cleaning himself' with the aid of a bottle, jug, and 

tumbler; for no other cleansing instruments are visible in the bare 

brick room with rafters overhead and no plastered ceiling, into 

which he shows his visitor.



'Are you ready?'



'I am ready, Mister Jarsper.  Let the old uns come out if they 

dare, when we go among their tombs.  My spirit is ready for 'em.'



'Do you mean animal spirits, or ardent?'



'The one's the t'other,' answers Durdles, 'and I mean 'em both.'



He takes a lantern from a hook, puts a match or two in his pocket 

wherewith to light it, should there be need; and they go out 

together, dinner-bundle and all.



Surely an unaccountable sort of expedition!  That Durdles himself, 

who is always prowling among old graves, and ruins, like a Ghoul - 

that he should be stealing forth to climb, and dive, and wander 

without an object, is nothing extraordinary; but that the Choir-

Master or any one else should hold it worth his while to be with 

him, and to study moonlight effects in such company is another 

affair.  Surely an unaccountable sort of expedition, therefore!



''Ware that there mound by the yard-gate, Mister Jarsper.'



'I see it.  What is it?'



'Lime.'



Mr. Jasper stops, and waits for him to come up, for he lags behind.  

'What you call quick-lime?'



'Ay!' says Durdles; 'quick enough to eat your boots.  With a little 

handy stirring, quick enough to eat your bones.'



They go on, presently passing the red windows of the Travellers' 

Twopenny, and emerging into the clear moonlight of the Monks' 

Vineyard.  This crossed, they come to Minor Canon Corner:  of which 

the greater part lies in shadow until the moon shall rise higher in 

the sky.



The sound of a closing house-door strikes their ears, and two men 

come out.  These are Mr. Crisparkle and Neville.  Jasper, with a 

strange and sudden smile upon his face, lays the palm of his hand 

upon the breast of Durdles, stopping him where he stands.



At that end of Minor Canon Corner the shadow is profound in the 

existing state of the light:  at that end, too, there is a piece of 

old dwarf wall, breast high, the only remaining boundary of what 

was once a garden, but is now the thoroughfare.  Jasper and Durdles 

would have turned this wall in another instant; but, stopping so 

short, stand behind it.



'Those two are only sauntering,' Jasper whispers; 'they will go out 

into the moonlight soon.  Let us keep quiet here, or they will 

detain us, or want to join us, or what not.'



Durdles nods assent, and falls to munching some fragments from his 

bundle.  Jasper folds his arms upon the top of the wall, and, with 

his chin resting on them, watches.  He takes no note whatever of 

the Minor Canon, but watches Neville, as though his eye were at the 

trigger of a loaded rifle, and he had covered him, and were going 

to fire.  A sense of destructive power is so expressed in his face, 

that even Durdles pauses in his munching, and looks at him, with an 

unmunched something in his cheek.



Meanwhile Mr. Crisparkle and Neville walk to and fro, quietly 

talking together.  What they say, cannot be heard consecutively; 

but Mr. Jasper has already distinguished his own name more than 

once.



'This is the first day of the week,' Mr. Crisparkle can be 

distinctly heard to observe, as they turn back; 'and the last day 

of the week is Christmas Eve.'



'You may be certain of me, sir.'



The echoes were favourable at those points, but as the two 

approach, the sound of their talking becomes confused again.  The 

word 'confidence,' shattered by the echoes, but still capable of 

being pieced together, is uttered by Mr. Crisparkle.  As they draw 

still nearer, this fragment of a reply is heard:  'Not deserved 

yet, but shall be, sir.'  As they turn away again, Jasper again 

hears his own name, in connection with the words from Mr. 

Crisparkle:  'Remember that I said I answered for you confidently.'  

Then the sound of their talk becomes confused again; they halting 

for a little while, and some earnest action on the part of Neville 

succeeding.  When they move once more, Mr. Crisparkle is seen to 

look up at the sky, and to point before him.  They then slowly 

disappear; passing out into the moonlight at the opposite end of 

the Corner.



It is not until they are gone, that Mr. Jasper moves.  But then he 

turns to Durdles, and bursts into a fit of laughter.  Durdles, who 

still has that suspended something in his cheek, and who sees 

nothing to laugh at, stares at him until Mr. Jasper lays his face 

down on his arms to have his laugh out.  Then Durdles bolts the 

something, as if desperately resigning himself to indigestion.



Among those secluded nooks there is very little stir or movement 

after dark.  There is little enough in the high tide of the day, 

but there is next to none at night.  Besides that the cheerfully 

frequented High Street lies nearly parallel to the spot (the old 

Cathedral rising between the two), and is the natural channel in 

which the Cloisterham traffic flows, a certain awful hush pervades 

the ancient pile, the cloisters, and the churchyard, after dark, 

which not many people care to encounter.  Ask the first hundred 

citizens of Cloisterham, met at random in the streets at noon, if 

they believed in Ghosts, they would tell you no; but put them to 

choose at night between these eerie Precincts and the thoroughfare 

of shops, and you would find that ninety-nine declared for the 

longer round and the more frequented way.  The cause of this is not 

to be found in any local superstition that attaches to the 

Precincts - albeit a mysterious lady, with a child in her arms and 

a rope dangling from her neck, has been seen flitting about there 

by sundry witnesses as intangible as herself - but it is to be 

sought in the innate shrinking of dust with the breath of life in 

it from dust out of which the breath of life has passed; also, in 

the widely diffused, and almost as widely unacknowledged, 

reflection:  'If the dead do, under any circumstances, become 

visible to the living, these are such likely surroundings for the 

purpose that I, the living, will get out of them as soon as I can.'  

Hence, when Mr. Jasper and Durdles pause to glance around them, 

before descending into the crypt by a small side door, of which the 

latter has a key, the whole expanse of moonlight in their view is 

utterly deserted.  One might fancy that the tide of life was 

stemmed by Mr. Jasper's own gatehouse.  The murmur of the tide is 

heard beyond; but no wave passes the archway, over which his lamp 

burns red behind his curtain, as if the building were a Lighthouse.



They enter, locking themselves in, descend the rugged steps, and 

are down in the Crypt.  The lantern is not wanted, for the 

moonlight strikes in at the groined windows, bare of glass, the 

broken frames for which cast patterns on the ground.  The heavy 

pillars which support the roof engender masses of black shade, but 

between them there are lanes of light.  Up and down these lanes 

they walk, Durdles discoursing of the 'old uns' he yet counts on 

disinterring, and slapping a wall, in which he considers 'a whole 

family on 'em' to be stoned and earthed up, just as if he were a 

familiar friend of the family.  The taciturnity of Durdles is for 

the time overcome by Mr. Jasper's wicker bottle, which circulates 

freely; - in the sense, that is to say, that its contents enter 

freely into Mr. Durdles's circulation, while Mr. Jasper only rinses 

his mouth once, and casts forth the rinsing.



They are to ascend the great Tower.  On the steps by which they 

rise to the Cathedral, Durdles pauses for new store of breath.  The 

steps are very dark, but out of the darkness they can see the lanes 

of light they have traversed.  Durdles seats himself upon a step.  

Mr. Jasper seats himself upon another.  The odour from the wicker 

bottle (which has somehow passed into Durdles's keeping) soon 

intimates that the cork has been taken out; but this is not 

ascertainable through the sense of sight, since neither can descry 

the other.  And yet, in talking, they turn to one another, as 

though their faces could commune together.



'This is good stuff, Mister Jarsper!'



'It is very good stuff, I hope. - I bought it on purpose.'



'They don't show, you see, the old uns don't, Mister Jarsper!'



'It would be a more confused world than it is, if they could.'



'Well, it WOULD lead towards a mixing of things,' Durdles 

acquiesces:  pausing on the remark, as if the idea of ghosts had 

not previously presented itself to him in a merely inconvenient 

light, domestically or chronologically.  'But do you think there 

may be Ghosts of other things, though not of men and women?'



'What things?  Flower-beds and watering-pots? horses and harness?'



'No.  Sounds.'



'What sounds?'



'Cries.'



'What cries do you mean?  Chairs to mend?'



'No.  I mean screeches.  Now I'll tell you, Mr. Jarsper.  Wait a 

bit till I put the bottle right.'  Here the cork is evidently taken 

out again, and replaced again.  'There!  NOW it's right!  This time 

last year, only a few days later, I happened to have been doing 

what was correct by the season, in the way of giving it the welcome 

it had a right to expect, when them town-boys set on me at their 

worst.  At length I gave 'em the slip, and turned in here.  And 

here I fell asleep.  And what woke me?  The ghost of a cry.  The 

ghost of one terrific shriek, which shriek was followed by the 

ghost of the howl of a dog:  a long, dismal, woeful howl, such as a 

dog gives when a person's dead.  That was MY last Christmas Eve.'



'What do you mean?' is the very abrupt, and, one might say, fierce 

retort.



'I mean that I made inquiries everywhere about, and, that no living 

ears but mine heard either that cry or that howl.  So I say they 

was both ghosts; though why they came to me, I've never made out.'



'I thought you were another kind of man,' says Jasper, scornfully.



'So I thought myself,' answers Durdles with his usual composure; 

'and yet I was picked out for it.'



Jasper had risen suddenly, when he asked him what he meant, and he 

now says, 'Come; we shall freeze here; lead the way.'



Durdles complies, not over-steadily; opens the door at the top of 

the steps with the key he has already used; and so emerges on the 

Cathedral level, in a passage at the side of the chancel.  Here, 

the moonlight is so very bright again that the colours of the 

nearest stained-glass window are thrown upon their faces.  The 

appearance of the unconscious Durdles, holding the door open for 

his companion to follow, as if from the grave, is ghastly enough, 

with a purple hand across his face, and a yellow splash upon his 

brow; but he bears the close scrutiny of his companion in an 

insensible way, although it is prolonged while the latter fumbles 

among his pockets for a key confided to him that will open an iron 

gate, so to enable them to pass to the staircase of the great 

tower.



'That and the bottle are enough for you to carry,' he says, giving 

it to Durdles; 'hand your bundle to me; I am younger and longer-

winded than you.'  Durdles hesitates for a moment between bundle 

and bottle; but gives the preference to the bottle as being by far 

the better company, and consigns the dry weight to his fellow-

explorer.



Then they go up the winding staircase of the great tower, 

toilsomely, turning and turning, and lowering their heads to avoid 

the stairs above, or the rough stone pivot around which they twist.  

Durdles has lighted his lantern, by drawing from the cold, hard 

wall a spark of that mysterious fire which lurks in everything, 

and, guided by this speck, they clamber up among the cobwebs and 

the dust.  Their way lies through strange places.  Twice or thrice 

they emerge into level, low-arched galleries, whence they can look 

down into the moon-lit nave; and where Durdles, waving his lantern, 

waves the dim angels' heads upon the corbels of the roof, seeming 

to watch their progress.  Anon they turn into narrower and steeper 

staircases, and the night-air begins to blow upon them, and the 

chirp of some startled jackdaw or frightened rook precedes the 

heavy beating of wings in a confined space, and the beating down of 

dust and straws upon their heads.  At last, leaving their light 

behind a stair - for it blows fresh up here - they look down on 

Cloisterham, fair to see in the moonlight:  its ruined habitations 

and sanctuaries of the dead, at the tower's base:  its moss-

softened red-tiled roofs and red-brick houses of the living, 

clustered beyond:  its river winding down from the mist on the 

horizon, as though that were its source, and already heaving with a 

restless knowledge of its approach towards the sea.



Once again, an unaccountable expedition this!  Jasper (always 

moving softly with no visible reason) contemplates the scene, and 

especially that stillest part of it which the Cathedral 

overshadows.  But he contemplates Durdles quite as curiously, and 

Durdles is by times conscious of his watchful eyes.



Only by times, because Durdles is growing drowsy.  As aeronauts 

lighten the load they carry, when they wish to rise, similarly 

Durdles has lightened the wicker bottle in coming up.  Snatches of 

sleep surprise him on his legs, and stop him in his talk.  A mild 

fit of calenture seizes him, in which he deems that the ground so 

far below, is on a level with the tower, and would as lief walk off 

the tower into the air as not.  Such is his state when they begin 

to come down.  And as aeronauts make themselves heavier when they 

wish to descend, similarly Durdles charges himself with more liquid 

from the wicker bottle, that he may come down the better.



The iron gate attained and locked - but not before Durdles has 

tumbled twice, and cut an eyebrow open once - they descend into the 

crypt again, with the intent of issuing forth as they entered.  

But, while returning among those lanes of light, Durdles becomes so 

very uncertain, both of foot and speech, that he half drops, half 

throws himself down, by one of the heavy pillars, scarcely less 

heavy than itself, and indistinctly appeals to his companion for 

forty winks of a second each.



'If you will have it so, or must have it so,' replies Jasper, 'I'll 

not leave you here.  Take them, while I walk to and fro.'



Durdles is asleep at once; and in his sleep he dreams a dream.



It is not much of a dream, considering the vast extent of the 

domains of dreamland, and their wonderful productions; it is only 

remarkable for being unusually restless and unusually real.  He 

dreams of lying there, asleep, and yet counting his companion's 

footsteps as he walks to and fro.  He dreams that the footsteps die 

away into distance of time and of space, and that something touches 

him, and that something falls from his hand.  Then something clinks 

and gropes about, and he dreams that he is alone for so long a 

time, that the lanes of light take new directions as the moon 

advances in her course.  From succeeding unconsciousness he passes 

into a dream of slow uneasiness from cold; and painfully awakes to 

a perception of the lanes of light - really changed, much as he had 

dreamed - and Jasper walking among them, beating his hands and 

feet.



'Holloa!' Durdles cries out, unmeaningly alarmed.



'Awake at last?' says Jasper, coming up to him.  'Do you know that 

your forties have stretched into thousands?'



'No.'



'They have though.'



'What's the time?'



'Hark!  The bells are going in the Tower!'



They strike four quarters, and then the great bell strikes.



'Two!' cries Durdles, scrambling up; 'why didn't you try to wake 

me, Mister Jarsper?'



'I did.  I might as well have tried to wake the dead - your own 

family of dead, up in the corner there.'



'Did you touch me?'



'Touch you!  Yes.  Shook you.'



As Durdles recalls that touching something in his dream, he looks 

down on the pavement, and sees the key of the crypt door lying 

close to where he himself lay.



'I dropped you, did I?' he says, picking it up, and recalling that 

part of his dream.  As he gathers himself up again into an upright 

position, or into a position as nearly upright as he ever 

maintains, he is again conscious of being watched by his companion.



'Well?' says Jasper, smiling, 'are you quite ready?  Pray don't 

hurry.'



'Let me get my bundle right, Mister Jarsper, and I'm with you.'  As 

he ties it afresh, he is once more conscious that he is very 

narrowly observed.



'What do you suspect me of, Mister Jarsper?' he asks, with drunken 

displeasure.  'Let them as has any suspicions of Durdles name 'em.'



'I've no suspicions of you, my good Mr. Durdles; but I have 

suspicions that my bottle was filled with something stiffer than 

either of us supposed.  And I also have suspicions,' Jasper adds, 

taking it from the pavement and turning it bottom upwards, 'that 

it's empty.'



Durdles condescends to laugh at this.  Continuing to chuckle when 

his laugh is over, as though remonstrant with himself on his 

drinking powers, he rolls to the door and unlocks it.  They both 

pass out, and Durdles relocks it, and pockets his key.



'A thousand thanks for a curious and interesting night,' says 

Jasper, giving him his hand; 'you can make your own way home?'



'I should think so!' answers Durdles.  'If you was to offer Durdles 

the affront to show him his way home, he wouldn't go home.





Durdles wouldn't go home till morning;

And THEN Durdles wouldn't go home,





Durdles wouldn't.'  This with the utmost defiance.



'Good-night, then.'



'Good-night, Mister Jarsper.'



Each is turning his own way, when a sharp whistle rends the 

silence, and the jargon is yelped out:





Widdy widdy wen!

I - ket - ches - Im - out - ar - ter - ten.

Widdy widdy wy!

Then - E - don't  - go - then - I - shy -

Widdy Widdy Wake-cock warning!'





Instantly afterwards, a rapid fire of stones rattles at the 

Cathedral wall, and the hideous small boy is beheld opposite, 

dancing in the moonlight.



'What!  Is that baby-devil on the watch there!' cries Jasper in a 

fury:  so quickly roused, and so violent, that he seems an older 

devil himself.  'I shall shed the blood of that impish wretch!  I 

know I shall do it!'  Regardless of the fire, though it hits him 

more than once, he rushes at Deputy, collars him, and tries to 

bring him across.  But Deputy is not to be so easily brought 

across.  With a diabolical insight into the strongest part of his 

position, he is no sooner taken by the throat than he curls up his 

legs, forces his assailant to hang him, as it were, and gurgles in 

his throat, and screws his body, and twists, as already undergoing 

the first agonies of strangulation.  There is nothing for it but to 

drop him.  He instantly gets himself together, backs over to 

Durdles, and cries to his assailant, gnashing the great gap in 

front of his mouth with rage and malice:



'I'll blind yer, s'elp me!  I'll stone yer eyes out, s'elp me!  If 

I don't have yer eyesight, bellows me!'  At the same time dodging 

behind Durdles, and snarling at Jasper, now from this side of him, 

and now from that:  prepared, if pounced upon, to dart away in all 

manner of curvilinear directions, and, if run down after all, to 

grovel in the dust, and cry:  'Now, hit me when I'm down!  Do it!'



'Don't hurt the boy, Mister Jarsper,' urges Durdles, shielding him.  

'Recollect yourself.'



'He followed us to-night, when we first came here!'



'Yer lie, I didn't!' replies Deputy, in his one form of polite 

contradiction.



'He has been prowling near us ever since!'



'Yer lie, I haven't,' returns Deputy.  'I'd only jist come out for 

my 'elth when I see you two a-coming out of the Kin-freederel.  If





I - ket - ches - Im - out - ar - ter - ten!'





(with the usual rhythm and dance, though dodging behind Durdles), 

'it ain't ANY fault, is it?'



'Take him home, then,' retorts Jasper, ferociously, though with a 

strong check upon himself, 'and let my eyes be rid of the sight of 

you!'



Deputy, with another sharp whistle, at once expressing his relief, 

and his commencement of a milder stoning of Mr. Durdles, begins 

stoning that respectable gentleman home, as if he were a reluctant 

ox.  Mr. Jasper goes to his gatehouse, brooding.  And thus, as 

everything comes to an end, the unaccountable expedition comes to 

an end - for the time.
