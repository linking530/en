ROSA, having no relation that she knew of in the world, had, from 

the seventh year of her age, known no home but the Nuns' House, and 

no mother but Miss Twinkleton.  Her remembrance of her own mother 

was of a pretty little creature like herself (not much older than 

herself it seemed to her), who had been brought home in her 

father's arms, drowned.  The fatal accident had happened at a party 

of pleasure.  Every fold and colour in the pretty summer dress, and 

even the long wet hair, with scattered petals of ruined flowers 

still clinging to it, as the dead young figure, in its sad, sad 

beauty lay upon the bed, were fixed indelibly in Rosa's 

recollection.  So were the wild despair and the subsequent bowed-

down grief of her poor young father, who died broken-hearted on the 

first anniversary of that hard day.



The betrothal of Rosa grew out of the soothing of his year of 

mental distress by his fast friend and old college companion, 

Drood:  who likewise had been left a widower in his youth.  But he, 

too, went the silent road into which all earthly pilgrimages merge, 

some sooner, and some later; and thus the young couple had come to 

be as they were.



The atmosphere of pity surrounding the little orphan girl when she 

first came to Cloisterham, had never cleared away.  It had taken 

brighter hues as she grew older, happier, prettier; now it had been 

golden, now roseate, and now azure; but it had always adorned her 

with some soft light of its own.  The general desire to console and 

caress her, had caused her to be treated in the beginning as a 

child much younger than her years; the same desire had caused her 

to be still petted when she was a child no longer.  Who should be 

her favourite, who should anticipate this or that small present, or 

do her this or that small service; who should take her home for the 

holidays; who should write to her the oftenest when they were 

separated, and whom she would most rejoice to see again when they 

were reunited; even these gentle rivalries were not without their 

slight dashes of bitterness in the Nuns' House.  Well for the poor 

Nuns in their day, if they hid no harder strife under their veils 

and rosaries!



Thus Rosa had grown to be an amiable, giddy, wilful, winning little 

creature; spoilt, in the sense of counting upon kindness from all 

around her; but not in the sense of repaying it with indifference.  

Possessing an exhaustless well of affection in her nature, its 

sparkling waters had freshened and brightened the Nuns' House for 

years, and yet its depths had never yet been moved:  what might 

betide when that came to pass; what developing changes might fall 

upon the heedless head, and light heart, then; remained to be seen.



By what means the news that there had been a quarrel between the 

two young men overnight, involving even some kind of onslaught by 

Mr. Neville upon Edwin Drood, got into Miss Twinkleton's 

establishment before breakfast, it is impossible to say.  Whether 

it was brought in by the birds of the air, or came blowing in with 

the very air itself, when the casement windows were set open; 

whether the baker brought it kneaded into the bread, or the milkman 

delivered it as part of the adulteration of his milk; or the 

housemaids, beating the dust out of their mats against the 

gateposts, received it in exchange deposited on the mats by the 

town atmosphere; certain it is that the news permeated every gable 

of the old building before Miss Twinkleton was down, and that Miss 

Twinkleton herself received it through Mrs. Tisher, while yet in 

the act of dressing; or (as she might have expressed the phrase to 

a parent or guardian of a mythological turn) of sacrificing to the 

Graces.



Miss Landless's brother had thrown a bottle at Mr. Edwin Drood.



Miss Landless's brother had thrown a knife at Mr. Edwin Drood.



A knife became suggestive of a fork; and Miss Landless's brother 

had thrown a fork at Mr. Edwin Drood.



As in the governing precedence of Peter Piper, alleged to have 

picked the peck of pickled pepper, it was held physically desirable 

to have evidence of the existence of the peck of pickled pepper 

which Peter Piper was alleged to have picked; so, in this case, it 

was held psychologically important to know why Miss Landless's 

brother threw a bottle, knife, or fork-or bottle, knife, AND fork - 

for the cook had been given to understand it was all three - at Mr. 

Edwin Drood?



Well, then.  Miss Landless's brother had said he admired Miss Bud.  

Mr. Edwin Drood had said to Miss Landless's brother that he had no 

business to admire Miss Bud.  Miss Landless's brother had then 

'up'd' (this was the cook's exact information) with the bottle, 

knife, fork, and decanter (the decanter now coolly flying at 

everybody's head, without the least introduction), and thrown them 

all at Mr. Edwin Drood.



Poor little Rosa put a forefinger into each of her ears when these 

rumours began to circulate, and retired into a corner, beseeching 

not to be told any more; but Miss Landless, begging permission of 

Miss Twinkleton to go and speak with her brother, and pretty 

plainly showing that she would take it if it were not given, struck 

out the more definite course of going to Mr. Crisparkle's for 

accurate intelligence.



When she came back (being first closeted with Miss Twinkleton, in 

order that anything objectionable in her tidings might be retained 

by that discreet filter), she imparted to Rosa only, what had taken 

place; dwelling with a flushed cheek on the provocation her brother 

had received, but almost limiting it to that last gross affront as 

crowning 'some other words between them,' and, out of consideration 

for her new friend, passing lightly over the fact that the other 

words had originated in her lover's taking things in general so 

very easily.  To Rosa direct, she brought a petition from her 

brother that she would forgive him; and, having delivered it with 

sisterly earnestness, made an end of the subject.



It was reserved for Miss Twinkleton to tone down the public mind of 

the Nuns' House.  That lady, therefore, entering in a stately 

manner what plebeians might have called the school-room, but what, 

in the patrician language of the head of the Nuns' House, was 

euphuistically, not to say round-aboutedly, denominated 'the 

apartment allotted to study,' and saying with a forensic air, 

'Ladies!' all rose.  Mrs. Tisher at the same time grouped herself 

behind her chief, as representing Queen Elizabeth's first 

historical female friend at Tilbury fort.  Miss Twinkleton then 

proceeded to remark that Rumour, Ladies, had been represented by 

the bard of Avon - needless were it to mention the immortal 

SHAKESPEARE, also called the Swan of his native river, not 

improbably with some reference to the ancient superstition that 

that bird of graceful plumage (Miss Jennings will please stand 

upright) sang sweetly on the approach of death, for which we have 

no ornithological authority, - Rumour, Ladies, had been represented 

by that bard - hem! -





'who drew

The celebrated Jew,'





as painted full of tongues.  Rumour in Cloisterham (Miss Ferdinand 

will honour me with her attention) was no exception to the great 

limner's portrait of Rumour elsewhere.  A slight FRACAS between two 

young gentlemen occurring last night within a hundred miles of 

these peaceful walls (Miss Ferdinand, being apparently 

incorrigible, will have the kindness to write out this evening, in 

the original language, the first four fables of our vivacious 

neighbour, Monsieur La Fontaine) had been very grossly exaggerated 

by Rumour's voice.  In the first alarm and anxiety arising from our 

sympathy with a sweet young friend, not wholly to be dissociated 

from one of the gladiators in the bloodless arena in question (the 

impropriety of Miss Reynolds's appearing to stab herself in the 

hand with a pin, is far too obvious, and too glaringly unladylike, 

to be pointed out), we descended from our maiden elevation to 

discuss this uncongenial and this unfit theme.  Responsible 

inquiries having assured us that it was but one of those 'airy 

nothings' pointed at by the Poet (whose name and date of birth Miss 

Giggles will supply within half an hour), we would now discard the 

subject, and concentrate our minds upon the grateful labours of the 

day.



But the subject so survived all day, nevertheless, that Miss 

Ferdinand got into new trouble by surreptitiously clapping on a 

paper moustache at dinner-time, and going through the motions of 

aiming a water-bottle at Miss Giggles, who drew a table-spoon in 

defence.



Now, Rosa thought of this unlucky quarrel a great deal, and thought 

of it with an uncomfortable feeling that she was involved in it, as 

cause, or consequence, or what not, through being in a false 

position altogether as to her marriage engagement.  Never free from 

such uneasiness when she was with her affianced husband, it was not 

likely that she would be free from it when they were apart.  To-

day, too, she was cast in upon herself, and deprived of the relief 

of talking freely with her new friend, because the quarrel had been 

with Helena's brother, and Helena undisguisedly avoided the subject 

as a delicate and difficult one to herself.  At this critical time, 

of all times, Rosa's guardian was announced as having come to see 

her.



Mr. Grewgious had been well selected for his trust, as a man of 

incorruptible integrity, but certainly for no other appropriate 

quality discernible on the surface.  He was an arid, sandy man, 

who, if he had been put into a grinding-mill, looked as if he would 

have ground immediately into high-dried snuff.  He had a scanty 

flat crop of hair, in colour and consistency like some very mangy 

yellow fur tippet; it was so unlike hair, that it must have been a 

wig, but for the stupendous improbability of anybody's voluntarily 

sporting such a head.  The little play of feature that his face 

presented, was cut deep into it, in a few hard curves that made it 

more like work; and he had certain notches in his forehead, which 

looked as though Nature had been about to touch them into 

sensibility or refinement, when she had impatiently thrown away the 

chisel, and said:  'I really cannot be worried to finish off this 

man; let him go as he is.'



With too great length of throat at his upper end, and too much 

ankle-bone and heel at his lower; with an awkward and hesitating 

manner; with a shambling walk; and with what is called a near sight 

- which perhaps prevented his observing how much white cotton 

stocking he displayed to the public eye, in contrast with his black 

suit - Mr. Grewgious still had some strange capacity in him of 

making on the whole an agreeable impression.



Mr. Grewgious was discovered by his ward, much discomfited by being 

in Miss Twinkleton's company in Miss Twinkleton's own sacred room.  

Dim forebodings of being examined in something, and not coming well 

out of it, seemed to oppress the poor gentleman when found in these 

circumstances.



'My dear, how do you do?  I am glad to see you.  My dear, how much 

improved you are.  Permit me to hand you a chair, my dear.'



Miss Twinkleton rose at her little writing-table, saying, with 

general sweetness, as to the polite Universe:  'Will you permit me 

to retire?'



'By no means, madam, on my account.  I beg that you will not move.'



'I must entreat permission to MOVE,' returned Miss Twinkleton, 

repeating the word with a charming grace; 'but I will not withdraw, 

since you are so obliging.  If I wheel my desk to this corner 

window, shall I be in the way?'



'Madam!  In the way!'



'You are very kind. - Rosa, my dear, you will be under no 

restraint, I am sure.'



Here Mr. Grewgious, left by the fire with Rosa, said again:  'My 

dear, how do you do?  I am glad to see you, my dear.'  And having 

waited for her to sit down, sat down himself.



'My visits,' said Mr. Grewgious, 'are, like those of the angels - 

not that I compare myself to an angel.'



'No, sir,' said Rosa.



'Not by any means,' assented Mr. Grewgious.  'I merely refer to my 

visits, which are few and far between.  The angels are, we know 

very well, up-stairs.'



Miss Twinkleton looked round with a kind of stiff stare.



'I refer, my dear,' said Mr. Grewgious, laying his hand on Rosa's, 

as the possibility thrilled through his frame of his otherwise 

seeming to take the awful liberty of calling Miss Twinkleton my 

dear; 'I refer to the other young ladies.'



Miss Twinkleton resumed her writing.



Mr. Grewgious, with a sense of not having managed his opening point 

quite as neatly as he might have desired, smoothed his head from 

back to front as if he had just dived, and were pressing the water 

out - this smoothing action, however superfluous, was habitual with 

him - and took a pocket-book from his coat-pocket, and a stump of 

black-lead pencil from his waistcoat-pocket.



'I made,' he said, turning the leaves:  'I made a guiding 

memorandum or so - as I usually do, for I have no conversational 

powers whatever - to which I will, with your permission, my dear, 

refer.  "Well and happy."  Truly.  You are well and happy, my dear?  

You look so.'



'Yes, indeed, sir,' answered Rosa.



'For which,' said Mr. Grewgious, with a bend of his head towards 

the corner window, 'our warmest acknowledgments are due, and I am 

sure are rendered, to the maternal kindness and the constant care 

and consideration of the lady whom I have now the honour to see 

before me.'



This point, again, made but a lame departure from Mr. Grewgious, 

and never got to its destination; for, Miss Twinkleton, feeling 

that the courtesies required her to be by this time quite outside 

the conversation, was biting the end of her pen, and looking 

upward, as waiting for the descent of an idea from any member of 

the Celestial Nine who might have one to spare.



Mr. Grewgious smoothed his smooth head again, and then made another 

reference to his pocket-book; lining out 'well and happy,' as 

disposed of.



'"Pounds, shillings, and pence," is my next note.  A dry subject 

for a young lady, but an important subject too.  Life is pounds, 

shillings, and pence.  Death is - '  A sudden recollection of the 

death of her two parents seemed to stop him, and he said in a 

softer tone, and evidently inserting the negative as an after-

thought:  'Death is NOT pounds, shillings, and pence.'



His voice was as hard and dry as himself, and Fancy might have 

ground it straight, like himself, into high-dried snuff.  And yet, 

through the very limited means of expression that he possessed, he 

seemed to express kindness.  If Nature had but finished him off, 

kindness might have been recognisable in his face at this moment.  

But if the notches in his forehead wouldn't fuse together, and if 

his face would work and couldn't play, what could he do, poor man!



'"Pounds, shillings, and pence."  You find your allowance always 

sufficient for your wants, my dear?'



Rosa wanted for nothing, and therefore it was ample.



'And you are not in debt?'



Rosa laughed at the idea of being in debt.  It seemed, to her 

inexperience, a comical vagary of the imagination.  Mr. Grewgious 

stretched his near sight to be sure that this was her view of the 

case.  'Ah!' he said, as comment, with a furtive glance towards 

Miss Twinkleton, and lining out pounds, shillings, and pence:  'I 

spoke of having got among the angels!  So I did!'



Rosa felt what his next memorandum would prove to be, and was 

blushing and folding a crease in her dress with one embarrassed 

hand, long before he found it.



'"Marriage."  Hem!'  Mr. Grewgious carried his smoothing hand down 

over his eyes and nose, and even chin, before drawing his chair a 

little nearer, and speaking a little more confidentially:  'I now 

touch, my dear, upon the point that is the direct cause of my 

troubling you with the present visit.  Othenwise, being a 

particularly Angular man, I should not have intruded here.  I am 

the last man to intrude into a sphere for which I am so entirely 

unfitted.  I feel, on these premises, as if I was a bear - with the 

cramp - in a youthful Cotillon.'



His ungainliness gave him enough of the air of his simile to set 

Rosa off laughing heartily.



'It strikes you in the same light,' said Mr. Grewgious, with 

perfect calmness.  'Just so.  To return to my memorandum.  Mr. 

Edwin has been to and fro here, as was arranged.  You have 

mentioned that, in your quarterly letters to me.  And you like him, 

and he likes you.'



'I LIKE him very much, sir,' rejoined Rosa.



'So I said, my dear,' returned her guardian, for whose ear the 

timid emphasis was much too fine.  'Good.  And you correspond.'



'We write to one another,' said Rosa, pouting, as she recalled 

their epistolary differences.



'Such is the meaning that I attach to the word "correspond" in this 

application, my dear,' said Mr. Grewgious.  'Good.  All goes well, 

time works on, and at this next Christmas-time it will become 

necessary, as a matter of form, to give the exemplary lady in the 

corner window, to whom we are so much indebted, business notice of 

your departure in the ensuing half-year.  Your relations with her 

are far more than business relations, no doubt; but a residue of 

business remains in them, and business is business ever.  I am a 

particularly Angular man,' proceeded Mr. Grewgious, as if it 

suddenly occurred to him to mention it, 'and I am not used to give 

anything away.  If, for these two reasons, some competent Proxy 

would give YOU away, I should take it very kindly.'



Rosa intimated, with her eyes on the ground, that she thought a 

substitute might be found, if required.



'Surely, surely,' said Mr. Grewgious.  'For instance, the gentleman 

who teaches Dancing here - he would know how to do it with graceful 

propriety.  He would advance and retire in a manner satisfactory to 

the feelings of the officiating clergyman, and of yourself, and the 

bridegroom, and all parties concerned.  I am - I am a particularly 

Angular man,' said Mr. Grewgious, as if he had made up his mind to 

screw it out at last:  'and should only blunder.'



Rosa sat still and silent.  Perhaps her mind had not got quite so 

far as the ceremony yet, but was lagging on the way there.



'Memorandum, "Will."  Now, my dear,' said Mr. Grewgious, referring 

to his notes, disposing of 'Marriage' with his pencil, and taking a 

paper from his pocket; 'although.  I have before possessed you with 

the contents of your father's will, I think it right at this time 

to leave a certified copy of it in your hands.  And although Mr. 

Edwin is also aware of its contents, I think it right at this time 

likewise to place a certified copy of it in Mr. Jasper's hand - '



'Not in his own!' asked Rosa, looking up quickly.  'Cannot the copy 

go to Eddy himself?'



'Why, yes, my dear, if you particularly wish it; but I spoke of Mr. 

Jasper as being his trustee.'



'I do particularly wish it, if you please,' said Rosa, hurriedly 

and earnestly; 'I don't like Mr. Jasper to come between us, in any 

way.'



'It is natural, I suppose,' said Mr. Grewgious, 'that your young 

husband should be all in all.  Yes.  You observe that I say, I 

suppose.  The fact is, I am a particularly Unnatural man, and I 

don't know from my own knowledge.'



Rosa looked at him with some wonder.



'I mean,' he explained, 'that young ways were never my ways.  I was 

the only offspring of parents far advanced in life, and I half 

believe I was born advanced in life myself.  No personality is 

intended towards the name you will so soon change, when I remark 

that while the general growth of people seem to have come into 

existence, buds, I seem to have come into existence a chip.  I was 

a chip - and a very dry one - when I first became aware of myself.  

Respecting the other certified copy, your wish shall be complied 

with.  Respecting your inheritance, I think you know all.  It is an 

annuity of two hundred and fifty pounds.  The savings upon that 

annuity, and some other items to your credit, all duly carried to 

account, with vouchers, will place you in possession of a lump-sum 

of money, rather exceeding Seventeen Hundred Pounds.  I am 

empowered to advance the cost of your preparations for your 

marriage out of that fund.  All is told.'



'Will you please tell me,' said Rosa, taking the paper with a 

prettily knitted brow, but not opening it:  'whether I am right in 

what I am going to say?  I can understand what you tell me, so very 

much better than what I read in law-writings.  My poor papa and 

Eddy's father made their agreement together, as very dear and firm 

and fast friends, in order that we, too, might be very dear and 

firm and fast friends after them?'



'Just so.'



'For the lasting good of both of us, and the lasting happiness of 

both of us?'



'Just so.'



'That we might be to one another even much more than they had been 

to one another?'



'Just so.'



'It was not bound upon Eddy, and it was not bound upon me, by any 

forfeit, in case - '



'Don't be agitated, my dear.  In the case that it brings tears into 

your affectionate eyes even to picture to yourself - in the case of 

your not marrying one another - no, no forfeiture on either side.  

You would then have been my ward until you were of age.  No worse 

would have befallen you.  Bad enough perhaps!'



'And Eddy?'



'He would have come into his partnership derived from his father, 

and into its arrears to his credit (if any), on attaining his 

majority, just as now.'



Rosa, with her perplexed face and knitted brow, bit the corner of 

her attested copy, as she sat with her head on one side, looking 

abstractedly on the floor, and smoothing it with her foot.



'In short,' said Mr. Grewgious, 'this betrothal is a wish, a 

sentiment, a friendly project, tenderly expressed on both sides.  

That it was strongly felt, and that there was a lively hope that it 

would prosper, there can be no doubt.  When you were both children, 

you began to be accustomed to it, and it HAS prospered.  But 

circumstances alter cases; and I made this visit to-day, partly, 

indeed principally, to discharge myself of the duty of telling you, 

my dear, that two young people can only be betrothed in marriage 

(except as a matter of convenience, and therefore mockery and 

misery) of their own free will, their own attachment, and their own 

assurance (it may or it may not prove a mistaken one, but we must 

take our chance of that), that they are suited to each other, and 

will make each other happy.  Is it to be supposed, for example, 

that if either of your fathers were living now, and had any 

mistrust on that subject, his mind would not be changed by the 

change of circumstances involved in the change of your years?  

Untenable, unreasonable, inconclusive, and preposterous!'



Mr. Grewgious said all this, as if he were reading it aloud; or, 

still more, as if he were repeating a lesson.  So expressionless of 

any approach to spontaneity were his face and manner.



'I have now, my dear,' he added, blurring out 'Will' with his 

pencil, 'discharged myself of what is doubtless a formal duty in 

this case, but still a duty in such a case.  Memorandum, "Wishes."  

My dear, is there any wish of yours that I can further?'



Rosa shook her head, with an almost plaintive air of hesitation in 

want of help.



'Is there any instruction that I can take from you with reference 

to your affairs?'



'I - I should like to settle them with Eddy first, if you please,' 

said Rosa, plaiting the crease in her dress.



'Surely, surely,' returned Mr. Grewgious.  'You two should be of 

one mind in all things.  Is the young gentleman expected shortly?'



'He has gone away only this morning.  He will be back at 

Christmas.'



'Nothing could happen better.  You will, on his return at 

Christmas, arrange all matters of detail with him; you will then 

communicate with me; and I will discharge myself (as a mere 

business acquaintance) of my business responsibilities towards the 

accomplished lady in the corner window.  They will accrue at that 

season.'  Blurring pencil once again.  'Memorandum, "Leave."  Yes.  

I will now, my dear, take my leave.'



'Could I,' said Rosa, rising, as he jerked out of his chair in his 

ungainly way:  'could I ask you, most kindly to come to me at 

Christmas, if I had anything particular to say to you?'



'Why, certainly, certainly,' he rejoined; apparently - if such a 

word can be used of one who had no apparent lights or shadows about 

him - complimented by the question.  'As a particularly Angular 

man, I do not fit smoothly into the social circle, and consequently 

I have no other engagement at Christmas-time than to partake, on 

the twenty-fifth, of a boiled turkey and celery sauce with a - with 

a particularly Angular clerk I have the good fortune to possess, 

whose father, being a Norfolk farmer, sends him up (the turkey up), 

as a present to me, from the neighbourhood of Norwich.  I should be 

quite proud of your wishing to see me, my dear.  As a professional 

Receiver of rents, so very few people DO wish to see me, that the 

novelty would be bracing.'



For his ready acquiescence, the grateful Rosa put her hands upon 

his shoulders, stood on tiptoe, and instantly kissed him.



'Lord bless me!' cried Mr. Grewgious.  'Thank you, my dear!  The 

honour is almost equal to the pleasure.  Miss Twinkleton, madam, I 

have had a most satisfactory conversation with my ward, and I will 

now release you from the incumbrance of my presence.'



'Nay, sir,' rejoined Miss Twinkleton, rising with a gracious 

condescension:  'say not incumbrance.  Not so, by any means.  I 

cannot permit you to say so.'



'Thank you, madam.  I have read in the newspapers,' said Mr. 

Grewgious, stammering a little, 'that when a distinguished visitor 

(not that I am one:  far from it) goes to a school (not that this 

is one:  far from it), he asks for a holiday, or some sort of 

grace.  It being now the afternoon in the - College - of which you 

are the eminent head, the young ladies might gain nothing, except 

in name, by having the rest of the day allowed them.  But if there 

is any young lady at all under a cloud, might I solicit - '



'Ah, Mr. Grewgious, Mr. Grewgious!' cried Miss Twinkleton, with a 

chastely-rallying forefinger.  'O you gentlemen, you gentlemen!  

Fie for shame, that you are so hard upon us poor maligned 

disciplinarians of our sex, for your sakes!  But as Miss Ferdinand 

is at present weighed down by an incubus' - Miss Twinkleton might 

have said a pen-and-ink-ubus of writing out Monsieur La Fontaine - 

'go to her, Rosa my dear, and tell her the penalty is remitted, in 

deference to the intercession of your guardian, Mr. Grewgious.'



Miss Twinkleton here achieved a curtsey, suggestive of marvels 

happening to her respected legs, and which she came out of nobly, 

three yards behind her starting-point.



As he held it incumbent upon him to call on Mr. Jasper before 

leaving Cloisterham, Mr. Grewgious went to the gatehouse, and 

climbed its postern stair.  But Mr. Jasper's door being closed, and 

presenting on a slip of paper the word 'Cathedral,' the fact of its 

being service-time was borne into the mind of Mr. Grewgious.  So he 

descended the stair again, and, crossing the Close, paused at the 

great western folding-door of the Cathedral, which stood open on 

the fine and bright, though short-lived, afternoon, for the airing 

of the place.



'Dear me,' said Mr. Grewgious, peeping in, 'it's like looking down 

the throat of Old Time.'



Old Time heaved a mouldy sigh from tomb and arch and vault; and 

gloomy shadows began to deepen in corners; and damps began to rise 

from green patches of stone; and jewels, cast upon the pavement of 

the nave from stained glass by the declining sun, began to perish.  

Within the grill-gate of the chancel, up the steps surmounted 

loomingly by the fast-darkening organ, white robes could be dimly 

seen, and one feeble voice, rising and falling in a cracked, 

monotonous mutter, could at intervals be faintly heard.  In the 

free outer air, the river, the green pastures, and the brown arable 

lands, the teeming hills and dales, were reddened by the sunset:  

while the distant little windows in windmills and farm homesteads, 

shone, patches of bright beaten gold.  In the Cathedral, all became 

gray, murky, and sepulchral, and the cracked monotonous mutter went 

on like a dying voice, until the organ and the choir burst forth, 

and drowned it in a sea of music.  Then, the sea fell, and the 

dying voice made another feeble effort, and then the sea rose high, 

and beat its life out, and lashed the roof, and surged among the 

arches, and pierced the heights of the great tower; and then the 

sea was dry, and all was still.



Mr. Grewgious had by that time walked to the chancel-steps, where 

he met the living waters coming out.



'Nothing is the matter?'  Thus Jasper accosted him, rather quickly.  

'You have not been sent for?'



'Not at all, not at all.  I came down of my own accord.  I have 

been to my pretty ward's, and am now homeward bound again.'



'You found her thriving?'



'Blooming indeed.  Most blooming.  I merely came to tell her, 

seriously, what a betrothal by deceased parents is.'



'And what is it - according to your judgment?'



Mr. Grewgious noticed the whiteness of the lips that asked the 

question, and put it down to the chilling account of the Cathedral.



'I merely came to tell her that it could not be considered binding, 

against any such reason for its dissolution as a want of affection, 

or want of disposition to carry it into effect, on the side of 

either party.'



'May I ask, had you any especial reason for telling her that?'



Mr. Grewgious answered somewhat sharply:  'The especial reason of 

doing my duty, sir.  Simply that.'  Then he added:  'Come, Mr. 

Jasper; I know your affection for your nephew, and that you are 

quick to feel on his behalf.  I assure you that this implies not 

the least doubt of, or disrespect to, your nephew.'



'You could not,' returned Jasper, with a friendly pressure of his 

arm, as they walked on side by side, 'speak more handsomely.'



Mr. Grewgious pulled off his hat to smooth his head, and, having 

smoothed it, nodded it contentedly, and put his hat on again.



'I will wager,' said Jasper, smiling - his lips were still so white 

that he was conscious of it, and bit and moistened them while 

speaking:  'I will wager that she hinted no wish to be released 

from Ned.'



'And you will win your wager, if you do,' retorted Mr. Grewgious.  

'We should allow some margin for little maidenly delicacies in a 

young motherless creature, under such circumstances, I suppose; it 

is not in my line; what do you think?'



'There can be no doubt of it.'



'I am glad you say so.  Because,' proceeded Mr. Grewgious, who had 

all this time very knowingly felt his way round to action on his 

remembrance of what she had said of Jasper himself:  'because she 

seems to have some little delicate instinct that all preliminary 

arrangements had best be made between Mr. Edwin Drood and herself, 

don't you see?  She don't want us, don't you know?'



Jasper touched himself on the breast, and said, somewhat 

indistinctly:  'You mean me.'



Mr. Grewgious touched himself on the breast, and said:  'I mean us.  

Therefore, let them have their little discussions and councils 

together, when Mr. Edwin Drood comes back here at Christmas; and 

then you and I will step in, and put the final touches to the 

business.'



'So, you settled with her that you would come back at Christmas?' 

observed Jasper.  'I see!  Mr. Grewgious, as you quite fairly said 

just now, there is such an exceptional attachment between my nephew 

and me, that I am more sensitive for the dear, fortunate, happy, 

happy fellow than for myself.  But it is only right that the young 

lady should be considered, as you have pointed out, and that I 

should accept my cue from you.  I accept it.  I understand that at 

Christmas they will complete their preparations for May, and that 

their marriage will be put in final train by themselves, and that 

nothing will remain for us but to put ourselves in train also, and 

have everything ready for our formal release from our trusts, on 

Edwin's birthday.'



'That is my understanding,' assented Mr. Grewgious, as they shook 

hands to part.  'God bless them both!'



'God save them both!' cried Jasper.



'I said, bless them,' remarked the former, looking back over his 

shoulder.



'I said, save them,' returned the latter.  'Is there any 

difference?'
