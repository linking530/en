FULL half a year had come and gone, and Mr. Crisparkle sat in a 

waiting-room in the London chief offices of the Haven of 

Philanthropy, until he could have audience of Mr. Honeythunder.



In his college days of athletic exercises, Mr. Crisparkle had known 

professors of the Noble Art of fisticuffs, and had attended two or 

three of their gloved gatherings.  He had now an opportunity of 

observing that as to the phrenological formation of the backs of 

their heads, the Professing Philanthropists were uncommonly like 

the Pugilists.  In the development of all those organs which 

constitute, or attend, a propensity to 'pitch into' your fellow-

creatures, the Philanthropists were remarkably favoured.  There 

were several Professors passing in and out, with exactly the 

aggressive air upon them of being ready for a turn-up with any 

Novice who might happen to be on hand, that Mr. Crisparkle well 

remembered in the circles of the Fancy.  Preparations were in 

progress for a moral little Mill somewhere on the rural circuit, 

and other Professors were backing this or that Heavy-Weight as good 

for such or such speech-making hits, so very much after the manner 

of the sporting publicans, that the intended Resolutions might have 

been Rounds.  In an official manager of these displays much 

celebrated for his platform tactics, Mr. Crisparkle recognised (in 

a suit of black) the counterpart of a deceased benefactor of his 

species, an eminent public character, once known to fame as Frosty-

faced Fogo, who in days of yore superintended the formation of the 

magic circle with the ropes and stakes.  There were only three 

conditions of resemblance wanting between these Professors and 

those.  Firstly, the Philanthropists were in very bad training:  

much too fleshy, and presenting, both in face and figure, a 

superabundance of what is known to Pugilistic Experts as Suet 

Pudding.  Secondly, the Philanthropists had not the good temper of 

the Pugilists, and used worse language.  Thirdly, their fighting 

code stood in great need of revision, as empowering them not only 

to bore their man to the ropes, but to bore him to the confines of 

distraction; also to hit him when he was down, hit him anywhere and 

anyhow, kick him, stamp upon him, gouge him, and maul him behind 

his back without mercy.  In these last particulars the Professors 

of the Noble Art were much nobler than the Professors of 

Philanthropy.



Mr. Crisparkle was so completely lost in musing on these 

similarities and dissimilarities, at the same time watching the 

crowd which came and went by, always, as it seemed, on errands of 

antagonistically snatching something from somebody, and never 

giving anything to anybody, that his name was called before he 

heard it.  On his at length responding, he was shown by a miserably 

shabby and underpaid stipendiary Philanthropist (who could hardly 

have done worse if he had taken service with a declared enemy of 

the human race) to Mr. Honeythunder's room.



'Sir,' said Mr. Honeythunder, in his tremendous voice, like a 

schoolmaster issuing orders to a boy of whom he had a bad opinion, 

'sit down.'



Mr. Crisparkle seated himself.



Mr. Honeythunder having signed the remaining few score of a few 

thousand circulars, calling upon a corresponding number of families 

without means to come forward, stump up instantly, and be 

Philanthropists, or go to the Devil, another shabby stipendiary 

Philanthropist (highly disinterested, if in earnest) gathered these 

into a basket and walked off with them.



'Now, Mr. Crisparkle,' said Mr. Honeythunder, turning his chair 

half round towards him when they were alone, and squaring his arms 

with his hands on his knees, and his brows knitted, as if he added, 

I am going to make short work of YOU:  'Now, Mr. Crisparkle, we 

entertain different views, you and I, sir, of the sanctity of human 

life.'



'Do we?' returned the Minor Canon.



'We do, sir?'



'Might I ask you,' said the Minor Canon:  'what are your views on 

that subject?'



'That human life is a thing to be held sacred, sir.'



'Might I ask you,' pursued the Minor Canon as before:  'what you 

suppose to be my views on that subject?'



'By George, sir!' returned the Philanthropist, squaring his arms 

still more, as he frowned on Mr. Crisparkle:  'they are best known 

to yourself.'



'Readily admitted.  But you began by saying that we took different 

views, you know.  Therefore (or you could not say so) you must have 

set up some views as mine.  Pray, what views HAVE you set up as 

mine?'



'Here is a man - and a young man,' said Mr. Honeythunder, as if 

that made the matter infinitely worse, and he could have easily 

borne the loss of an old one, 'swept off the face of the earth by a 

deed of violence.  What do you call that?'



'Murder,' said the Minor Canon.



'What do you call the doer of that deed, sir?



'A murderer,' said the Minor Canon.



'I am glad to hear you admit so much, sir,' retorted Mr. 

Honeythunder, in his most offensive manner; 'and I candidly tell 

you that I didn't expect it.'  Here he lowered heavily at Mr. 

Crisparkle again.



'Be so good as to explain what you mean by those very unjustifiable 

expressions.'



'I don't sit here, sir,' returned the Philanthropist, raising his 

voice to a roar, 'to be browbeaten.'



'As the only other person present, no one can possibly know that 

better than I do,' returned the Minor Canon very quietly.  'But I 

interrupt your explanation.'



'Murder!' proceeded Mr. Honeythunder, in a kind of boisterous 

reverie, with his platform folding of his arms, and his platform 

nod of abhorrent reflection after each short sentiment of a word.  

'Bloodshed!  Abel!  Cain!  I hold no terms with Cain.  I repudiate 

with a shudder the red hand when it is offered me.'



Instead of instantly leaping into his chair and cheering himself 

hoarse, as the Brotherhood in public meeting assembled would 

infallibly have done on this cue, Mr. Crisparkle merely reversed 

the quiet crossing of his legs, and said mildly:  'Don't let me 

interrupt your explanation - when you begin it.'



'The Commandments say, no murder.  NO murder, sir!' proceeded Mr. 

Honeythunder, platformally pausing as if he took Mr. Crisparkle to 

task for having distinctly asserted that they said:  You may do a 

little murder, and then leave off.



'And they also say, you shall bear no false witness,' observed Mr. 

Crisparkle.



'Enough!' bellowed Mr. Honeythunder, with a solemnity and severity 

that would have brought the house down at a meeting, 'E-e-nough!  

My late wards being now of age, and I being released from a trust 

which I cannot contemplate without a thrill of horror, there are 

the accounts which you have undertaken to accept on their behalf, 

and there is a statement of the balance which you have undertaken 

to receive, and which you cannot receive too soon.  And let me tell 

you, sir, I wish that, as a man and a Minor Canon, you were better 

employed,' with a nod.  'Better employed,' with another nod.  'Bet-

ter em-ployed!' with another and the three nods added up.



Mr. Crisparkle rose; a little heated in the face, but with perfect 

command of himself.



'Mr. Honeythunder,' he said, taking up the papers referred to:  'my 

being better or worse employed than I am at present is a matter of 

taste and opinion.  You might think me better employed in enrolling 

myself a member of your Society.'



'Ay, indeed, sir!' retorted Mr. Honeythunder, shaking his head in a 

threatening manner.  'It would have been better for you if you had 

done that long ago!'



'I think otherwise.'



'Or,' said Mr. Honeythunder, shaking his head again, 'I might think 

one of your profession better employed in devoting himself to the 

discovery and punishment of guilt than in leaving that duty to be 

undertaken by a layman.'



'I may regard my profession from a point of view which teaches me 

that its first duty is towards those who are in necessity and 

tribulation, who are desolate and oppressed,' said Mr. Crisparkle.  

'However, as I have quite clearly satisfied myself that it is no 

part of my profession to make professions, I say no more of that.  

But I owe it to Mr. Neville, and to Mr. Neville's sister (and in a 

much lower degree to myself), to say to you that I KNOW I was in 

the full possession and understanding of Mr. Neville's mind and 

heart at the time of this occurrence; and that, without in the 

least colouring or concealing what was to be deplored in him and 

required to be corrected, I feel certain that his tale is true.  

Feeling that certainty, I befriend him.  As long as that certainty 

shall last, I will befriend him.  And if any consideration could 

shake me in this resolve, I should be so ashamed of myself for my 

meanness, that no man's good opinion - no, nor no woman's - so 

gained, could compensate me for the loss of my own.'



Good fellow! manly fellow!  And he was so modest, too.  There was 

no more self-assertion in the Minor Canon than in the schoolboy who 

had stood in the breezy playing-fields keeping a wicket.  He was 

simply and staunchly true to his duty alike in the large case and 

in the small.  So all true souls ever are.  So every true soul ever 

was, ever is, and ever will be.  There is nothing little to the 

really great in spirit.



'Then who do you make out did the deed?' asked Mr. Honeythunder, 

turning on him abruptly.



'Heaven forbid,' said Mr. Crisparkle, 'that in my desire to clear 

one man I should lightly criminate another!  I accuse no one,'



'Tcha!' ejaculated Mr. Honeythunder with great disgust; for this 

was by no means the principle on which the Philanthropic 

Brotherhood usually proceeded.  'And, sir, you are not a 

disinterested witness, we must bear in mind.'



'How am I an interested one?' inquired Mr. Crisparkle, smiling 

innocently, at a loss to imagine.



'There was a certain stipend, sir, paid to you for your pupil, 

which may have warped your judgment a bit,' said Mr. Honeythunder, 

coarsely.



'Perhaps I expect to retain it still?'  Mr. Crisparkle returned, 

enlightened; 'do you mean that too?'



'Well, sir,' returned the professional Philanthropist, getting up 

and thrusting his hands down into his trousers-pockets, 'I don't go 

about measuring people for caps.  If people find I have any about 

me that fit 'em, they can put 'em on and wear 'em, if they like.  

That's their look out:  not mine.'



Mr. Crisparkle eyed him with a just indignation, and took him to 

task thus:



'Mr. Honeythunder, I hoped when I came in here that I might be 

under no necessity of commenting on the introduction of platform 

manners or platform manoeuvres among the decent forbearances of 

private life.  But you have given me such a specimen of both, that 

I should be a fit subject for both if I remained silent respecting 

them.  They are detestable.'



'They don't suit YOU, I dare say, sir.'



'They are,' repeated Mr. Crisparkle, without noticing the 

interruption, 'detestable.  They violate equally the justice that 

should belong to Christians, and the restraints that should belong 

to gentlemen.  You assume a great crime to have been committed by 

one whom I, acquainted with the attendant circumstances, and having 

numerous reasons on my side, devoutly believe to be innocent of it.  

Because I differ from you on that vital point, what is your 

platform resource?  Instantly to turn upon me, charging that I have 

no sense of the enormity of the crime itself, but am its aider and 

abettor!  So, another time - taking me as representing your 

opponent in other cases - you set up a platform credulity; a moved 

and seconded and carried-unanimously profession of faith in some 

ridiculous delusion or mischievous imposition.  I decline to 

believe it, and you fall back upon your platform resource of 

proclaiming that I believe nothing; that because I will not bow 

down to a false God of your making, I deny the true God!  Another 

time you make the platform discovery that War is a calamity, and 

you propose to abolish it by a string of twisted resolutions tossed 

into the air like the tail of a kite.  I do not admit the discovery 

to be yours in the least, and I have not a grain of faith in your 

remedy.  Again, your platform resource of representing me as 

revelling in the horrors of a battle-field like a fiend incarnate!  

Another time, in another of your undiscriminating platform rushes, 

you would punish the sober for the drunken.  I claim consideration 

for the comfort, convenience, and refreshment of the sober; and you 

presently make platform proclamation that I have a depraved desire 

to turn Heaven's creatures into swine and wild beasts!  In all such 

cases your movers, and your seconders, and your supporters  - your 

regular Professors of all degrees, run amuck like so many mad 

Malays; habitually attributing the lowest and basest motives with 

the utmost recklessness (let me call your attention to a recent 

instance in yourself for which you should blush), and quoting 

figures which you know to be as wilfully onesided as a statement of 

any complicated account that should be all Creditor side and no 

Debtor, or all Debtor side and no Creditor.  Therefore it is, Mr. 

Honeythunder, that I consider the platform a sufficiently bad 

example and a sufficiently bad school, even in public life; but 

hold that, carried into private life, it becomes an unendurable 

nuisance.'



'These are strong words, sir!' exclaimed the Philanthropist.



'I hope so,' said Mr. Crisparkle.  'Good morning.'



He walked out of the Haven at a great rate, but soon fell into his 

regular brisk pace, and soon had a smile upon his face as he went 

along, wondering what the china shepherdess would have said if she 

had seen him pounding Mr. Honeythunder in the late little lively 

affair.  For Mr. Crisparkle had just enough of harmless vanity to 

hope that he had hit hard, and to glow with the belief that he had 

trimmed the Philanthropic Jacket pretty handsomely.



He took himself to Staple Inn, but not to P. J. T. and Mr. 

Grewgious.  Full many a creaking stair he climbed before he reached 

some attic rooms in a corner, turned the latch of their unbolted 

door, and stood beside the table of Neville Landless.



An air of retreat and solitude hung about the rooms and about their 

inhabitant.  He was much worn, and so were they.  Their sloping 

ceilings, cumbrous rusty locks and grates, and heavy wooden bins 

and beams, slowly mouldering withal, had a prisonous look, and he 

had the haggard face of a prisoner.  Yet the sunlight shone in at 

the ugly garret-window, which had a penthouse to itself thrust out 

among the tiles; and on the cracked and smoke-blackened parapet 

beyond, some of the deluded sparrows of the place rheumatically 

hopped, like little feathered cripples who had left their crutches 

in their nests; and there was a play of living leaves at hand that 

changed the air, and made an imperfect sort of music in it that 

would have been melody in the country.



The rooms were sparely furnished, but with good store of books.  

Everything expressed the abode of a poor student.  That Mr. 

Crisparkle had been either chooser, lender, or donor of the books, 

or that he combined the three characters, might have been easily 

seen in the friendly beam of his eyes upon them as he entered.



'How goes it, Neville?'



'I am in good heart, Mr. Crisparkle, and working away.'



'I wish your eyes were not quite so large and not quite so bright,' 

said the Minor Canon, slowly releasing the hand he had taken in 

his.



'They brighten at the sight of you,' returned Neville.  'If you 

were to fall away from me, they would soon be dull enough.'



'Rally, rally!' urged the other, in a stimulating tone.  'Fight for 

it, Neville!'



'If I were dying, I feel as if a word from you would rally me; if 

my pulse had stopped, I feel as if your touch would make it beat 

again,' said Neville.  'But I HAVE rallied, and am doing famously.'



Mr. Crisparkle turned him with his face a little more towards the 

light.



'I want to see a ruddier touch here, Neville,' he said, indicating 

his own healthy cheek by way of pattern.  'I want more sun to shine 

upon you.'



Neville drooped suddenly, as he replied in a lowered voice:  'I am 

not hardy enough for that, yet.  I may become so, but I cannot bear 

it yet.  If you had gone through those Cloisterham streets as I 

did; if you had seen, as I did, those averted eyes, and the better 

sort of people silently giving me too much room to pass, that I 

might not touch them or come near them, you wouldn't think it quite 

unreasonable that I cannot go about in the daylight.'



'My poor fellow!' said the Minor Canon, in a tone so purely 

sympathetic that the young man caught his hand, 'I never said it 

was unreasonable; never thought so.  But I should like you to do 

it.'



'And that would give me the strongest motive to do it.  But I 

cannot yet.  I cannot persuade myself that the eyes of even the 

stream of strangers I pass in this vast city look at me without 

suspicion.  I feel marked and tainted, even when I go out - as I do 

only - at night.  But the darkness covers me then, and I take 

courage from it.'



Mr. Crisparkle laid a hand upon his shoulder, and stood looking 

down at him.



'If I could have changed my name,' said Neville, 'I would have done 

so.  But as you wisely pointed out to me, I can't do that, for it 

would look like guilt.  If I could have gone to some distant place, 

I might have found relief in that, but the thing is not to be 

thought of, for the same reason.  Hiding and escaping would be the 

construction in either case.  It seems a little hard to be so tied 

to a stake, and innocent; but I don't complain.'



'And you must expect no miracle to help you, Neville,' said Mr. 

Crisparkle, compassionately.



'No, sir, I know that.  The ordinary fulness of time and 

circumstances is all I have to trust to.'



'It will right you at last, Neville.'



'So I believe, and I hope I may live to know it.'



But perceiving that the despondent mood into which he was falling 

cast a shadow on the Minor Canon, and (it may be) feeling that the 

broad hand upon his shoulder was not then quite as steady as its 

own natural strength had rendered it when it first touched him just 

now, he brightened and said:



'Excellent circumstances for study, anyhow! and you know, Mr. 

Crisparkle, what need I have of study in all ways.  Not to mention 

that you have advised me to study for the difficult profession of 

the law, specially, and that of course I am guiding myself by the 

advice of such a friend and helper.  Such a good friend and 

helper!'



He took the fortifying hand from his shoulder, and kissed it.  Mr. 

Crisparkle beamed at the books, but not so brightly as when he had 

entered.



'I gather from your silence on the subject that my late guardian is 

adverse, Mr. Crisparkle?'



The Minor Canon answered:  'Your late guardian is a - a most 

unreasonable person, and it signifies nothing to any reasonable 

person whether he is ADverse, PERverse, or the REverse.'



'Well for me that I have enough with economy to live upon,' sighed 

Neville, half wearily and half cheerily, 'while I wait to be 

learned, and wait to be righted!  Else I might have proved the 

proverb, that while the grass grows, the steed starves!'



He opened some books as he said it, and was soon immersed in their 

interleaved and annotated passages; while Mr. Crisparkle sat beside 

him, expounding, correcting, and advising.  The Minor Canon's 

Cathedral duties made these visits of his difficult to accomplish, 

and only to be compassed at intervals of many weeks.  But they were 

as serviceable as they were precious to Neville Landless.



When they had got through such studies as they had in hand, they 

stood leaning on the window-sill, and looking down upon the patch 

of garden.  'Next week,' said Mr. Crisparkle, 'you will cease to be 

alone, and will have a devoted companion.'



'And yet,' returned Neville, 'this seems an uncongenial place to 

bring my sister to.'



'I don't think so,' said the Minor Canon.  'There is duty to be 

done here; and there are womanly feeling, sense, and courage wanted 

here.'



'I meant,' explained Neville, 'that the surroundings are so dull 

and unwomanly, and that Helena can have no suitable friend or 

society here.'



'You have only to remember,' said Mr. Crisparkle, 'that you are 

here yourself, and that she has to draw you into the sunlight.'



They were silent for a little while, and then Mr. Crisparkle began 

anew.



'When we first spoke together, Neville, you told me that your 

sister had risen out of the disadvantages of your past lives as 

superior to you as the tower of Cloisterham Cathedral is higher 

than the chimneys of Minor Canon Corner.  Do you remember that?'



'Right well!'



'I was inclined to think it at the time an enthusiastic flight.  No 

matter what I think it now.  What I would emphasise is, that under 

the head of Pride your sister is a great and opportune example to 

you.'



'Under ALL heads that are included in the composition of a fine 

character, she is.'



'Say so; but take this one.  Your sister has learnt how to govern 

what is proud in her nature.  She can dominate it even when it is 

wounded through her sympathy with you.  No doubt she has suffered 

deeply in those same streets where you suffered deeply.  No doubt 

her life is darkened by the cloud that darkens yours.  But bending 

her pride into a grand composure that is not haughty or aggressive, 

but is a sustained confidence in you and in the truth, she has won 

her way through those streets until she passes along them as high 

in the general respect as any one who treads them.  Every day and 

hour of her life since Edwin Drood's disappearance, she has faced 

malignity and folly - for you - as only a brave nature well 

directed can.  So it will be with her to the end.  Another and 

weaker kind of pride might sink broken-hearted, but never such a 

pride as hers:  which knows no shrinking, and can get no mastery 

over her.'



The pale cheek beside him flushed under the comparison, and the 

hint implied in it.



'I will do all I can to imitate her,' said Neville.



'Do so, and be a truly brave man, as she is a truly brave woman,' 

answered Mr. Crisparkle stoutly.  'It is growing dark.  Will you go 

my way with me, when it is quite dark?  Mind! it is not I who wait 

for darkness.'



Neville replied, that he would accompany him directly.  But Mr. 

Crisparkle said he had a moment's call to make on Mr. Grewgious as 

an act of courtesy, and would run across to that gentleman's 

chambers, and rejoin Neville on his own doorstep, if he would come 

down there to meet him.



Mr. Grewgious, bolt upright as usual, sat taking his wine in the 

dusk at his open window; his wineglass and decanter on the round 

table at his elbow; himself and his legs on the window-seat; only 

one hinge in his whole body, like a bootjack.



'How do you do, reverend sir?' said Mr. Grewgious, with abundant 

offers of hospitality, which were as cordially declined as made.  

'And how is your charge getting on over the way in the set that I 

had the pleasure of recommending to you as vacant and eligible?'



Mr. Crisparkle replied suitably.



'I am glad you approve of them,' said Mr. Grewgious, 'because I 

entertain a sort of fancy for having him under my eye.'



As Mr. Grewgious had to turn his eye up considerably before he 

could see the chambers, the phrase was to be taken figuratively and 

not literally.



'And how did you leave Mr. Jasper, reverend sir?' said Mr. 

Grewgious.



Mr. Crisparkle had left him pretty well.



'And where did you leave Mr. Jasper, reverend sir?'  Mr. Crisparkle 

had left him at Cloisterham.



'And when did you leave Mr. Jasper, reverend sir?'  That morning.



'Umps!' said Mr. Grewgious.  'He didn't say he was coming, 

perhaps?'



'Coming where?'



'Anywhere, for instance?' said Mr. Grewgious.



'No.'



'Because here he is,' said Mr. Grewgious, who had asked all these 

questions, with his preoccupied glance directed out at window.  

'And he don't look agreeable, does he?'



Mr. Crisparkle was craning towards the window, when Mr. Grewgious 

added:



'If you will kindly step round here behind me, in the gloom of the 

room, and will cast your eye at the second-floor landing window in 

yonder house, I think you will hardly fail to see a slinking 

individual in whom I recognise our local friend.'



'You are right!' cried Mr. Crisparkle.



'Umps!' said Mr. Grewgious.  Then he added, turning his face so 

abruptly that his head nearly came into collision with Mr. 

Crisparkle's:  'what should you say that our local friend was up 

to?'



The last passage he had been shown in the Diary returned on Mr. 

Crisparkle's mind with the force of a strong recoil, and he asked 

Mr. Grewgious if he thought it possible that Neville was to be 

harassed by the keeping of a watch upon him?



'A watch?' repeated Mr. Grewgious musingly.  'Ay!'



'Which would not only of itself haunt and torture his life,' said 

Mr. Crisparkle warmly, 'but would expose him to the torment of a 

perpetually reviving suspicion, whatever he might do, or wherever 

he might go.'



'Ay!' said Mr. Grewgious musingly still.  'Do I see him waiting for 

you?'



'No doubt you do.'



'Then WOULD you have the goodness to excuse my getting up to see 

you out, and to go out to join him, and to go the way that you were 

going, and to take no notice of our local friend?' said Mr. 

Grewgious.  'I entertain a sort of fancy for having HIM under my 

eye to-night, do you know?'



Mr. Crisparkle, with a significant need complied; and rejoining 

Neville, went away with him.  They dined together, and parted at 

the yet unfinished and undeveloped railway station:  Mr. Crisparkle 

to get home; Neville to walk the streets, cross the bridges, make a 

wide round of the city in the friendly darkness, and tire himself 

out.



It was midnight when he returned from his solitary expedition and 

climbed his staircase.  The night was hot, and the windows of the 

staircase were all wide open.  Coming to the top, it gave him a 

passing chill of surprise (there being no rooms but his up there) 

to find a stranger sitting on the window-sill, more after the 

manner of a venturesome glazier than an amateur ordinarily careful 

of his neck; in fact, so much more outside the window than inside, 

as to suggest the thought that he must have come up by the water-

spout instead of the stairs.



The stranger said nothing until Neville put his key in his door; 

then, seeming to make sure of his identity from the action, he 

spoke:



'I beg your pardon,' he said, coming from the window with a frank 

and smiling air, and a prepossessing address; 'the beans.'



Neville was quite at a loss.



'Runners,' said the visitor.  'Scarlet.  Next door at the back.'



'O,' returned Neville.  'And the mignonette and wall-flower?'



'The same,' said the visitor.



'Pray walk in.'



'Thank you.'



Neville lighted his candles, and the visitor sat down.  A handsome 

gentleman, with a young face, but with an older figure in its 

robustness and its breadth of shoulder; say a man of eight-and-

twenty, or at the utmost thirty; so extremely sunburnt that the 

contrast between his brown visage and the white forehead shaded out 

of doors by his hat, and the glimpses of white throat below the 

neckerchief, would have been almost ludicrous but for his broad 

temples, bright blue eyes, clustering brown hair, and laughing 

teeth.



'I have noticed,' said he; ' - my name is Tartar.'



Neville inclined his head.



'I have noticed (excuse me) that you shut yourself up a good deal, 

and that you seem to like my garden aloft here.  If you would like 

a little more of it, I could throw out a few lines and stays 

between my windows and yours, which the runners would take to 

directly.  And I have some boxes, both of mignonette and wall-

flower, that I could shove on along the gutter (with a boathook I 

have by me) to your windows, and draw back again when they wanted 

watering or gardening, and shove on again when they were ship-

shape; so that they would cause you no trouble.  I couldn't take 

this liberty without asking your permission, so I venture to ask 

it.  Tartar, corresponding set, next door.'



'You are very kind.'



'Not at all.  I ought to apologise for looking in so late.  But 

having noticed (excuse me) that you generally walk out at night, I 

thought I should inconvenience you least by awaiting your return.  

I am always afraid of inconveniencing busy men, being an idle man.'



'I should not have thought so, from your appearance.'



'No?  I take it as a compliment.  In fact, I was bred in the Royal 

Navy, and was First Lieutenant when I quitted it.  But, an uncle 

disappointed in the service leaving me his property on condition 

that I left the Navy, I accepted the fortune, and resigned my 

commission.'



'Lately, I presume?'



'Well, I had had twelve or fifteen years of knocking about first.  

I came here some nine months before you; I had had one crop before 

you came.  I chose this place, because, having served last in a 

little corvette, I knew I should feel more at home where I had a 

constant opportunity of knocking my head against the ceiling.  

Besides, it would never do for a man who had been aboard ship from 

his boyhood to turn luxurious all at once.  Besides, again; having 

been accustomed to a very short allowance of land all my life, I 

thought I'd feel my way to the command of a landed estate, by 

beginning in boxes.'



Whimsically as this was said, there was a touch of merry 

earnestness in it that made it doubly whimsical.



'However,' said the Lieutenant, 'I have talked quite enough about 

myself.  It is not my way, I hope; it has merely been to present 

myself to you naturally.  If you will allow me to take the liberty 

I have described, it will be a charity, for it will give me 

something more to do.  And you are not to suppose that it will 

entail any interruption or intrusion on you, for that is far from 

my intention.'



Neville replied that he was greatly obliged, and that he thankfully 

accepted the kind proposal.



'I am very glad to take your windows in tow,' said the Lieutenant.  

'From what I have seen of you when I have been gardening at mine, 

and you have been looking on, I have thought you (excuse me) rather 

too studious and delicate.  May I ask, is your health at all 

affected?'



'I have undergone some mental distress,' said Neville, confused, 

'which has stood me in the stead of illness.'



'Pardon me,' said Mr. Tartar.



With the greatest delicacy he shifted his ground to the windows 

again, and asked if he could look at one of them.  On Neville's 

opening it, he immediately sprang out, as if he were going aloft 

with a whole watch in an emergency, and were setting a bright 

example.



'For Heaven's sake,' cried Neville, 'don't do that!  Where are you 

going Mr. Tartar?  You'll be dashed to pieces!'



'All well!' said the Lieutenant, coolly looking about him on the 

housetop.  'All taut and trim here.  Those lines and stays shall be 

rigged before you turn out in the morning.  May I take this short 

cut home, and say good-night?'



'Mr. Tartar!' urged Neville.  'Pray!  It makes me giddy to see 

you!'



But Mr. Tartar, with a wave of his hand and the deftness of a cat, 

had already dipped through his scuttle of scarlet runners without 

breaking a leaf, and 'gone below.'



Mr. Grewgious, his bedroom window-blind held aside with his hand, 

happened at the moment to have Neville's chambers under his eye for 

the last time that night.  Fortunately his eye was on the front of 

the house and not the back, or this remarkable appearance and 

disappearance might have broken his rest as a phenomenon.  But Mr. 

Grewgious seeing nothing there, not even a light in the windows, 

his gaze wandered from the windows to the stars, as if he would 

have read in them something that was hidden from him.  Many of us 

would, if we could; but none of us so much as know our letters in 

the stars yet - or seem likely to do it, in this state of existence 

- and few languages can be read until their alphabets are mastered.
