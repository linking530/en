IT has been often enough remarked that women have a curious power 

of divining the characters of men, which would seem to be innate 

and instinctive; seeing that it is arrived at through no patient 

process of reasoning, that it can give no satisfactory or 

sufficient account of itself, and that it pronounces in the most 

confident manner even against accumulated observation on the part 

of the other sex.  But it has not been quite so often remarked that 

this power (fallible, like every other human attribute) is for the 

most part absolutely incapable of self-revision; and that when it 

has delivered an adverse opinion which by all human lights is 

subsequently proved to have failed, it is undistinguishable from 

prejudice, in respect of its determination not to be corrected.  

Nay, the very possibility of contradiction or disproof, however 

remote, communicates to this feminine judgment from the first, in 

nine cases out of ten, the weakness attendant on the testimony of 

an interested witness; so personally and strongly does the fair 

diviner connect herself with her divination.



'Now, don't you think, Ma dear,' said the Minor Canon to his mother 

one day as she sat at her knitting in his little book-room, 'that 

you are rather hard on Mr. Neville?'



'No, I do NOT, Sept,' returned the old lady.



'Let us discuss it, Ma.'



'I have no objection to discuss it, Sept.  I trust, my dear, I am 

always open to discussion.'  There was a vibration in the old 

lady's cap, as though she internally added:  'and I should like to 

see the discussion that would change MY mind!'



'Very good, Ma,' said her conciliatory son.  'There is nothing like 

being open to discussion.'



'I hope not, my dear,' returned the old lady, evidently shut to it.



'Well!  Mr. Neville, on that unfortunate occasion, commits himself 

under provocation.'



'And under mulled wine,' added the old lady.



'I must admit the wine.  Though I believe the two young men were 

much alike in that regard.'



'I don't,' said the old lady.



'Why not, Ma?'



'Because I DON'T,' said the old lady.  'Still, I am quite open to 

discussion.'



'But, my dear Ma, I cannot see how we are to discuss, if you take 

that line.'



'Blame Mr. Neville for it, Sept, and not me,' said the old lady, 

with stately severity.



'My dear Ma! why Mr. Neville?'



'Because,' said Mrs. Crisparkle, retiring on first principles, 'he 

came home intoxicated, and did great discredit to this house, and 

showed great disrespect to this family.'



'That is not to be denied, Ma.  He was then, and he is now, very 

sorry for it.'



'But for Mr. Jasper's well-bred consideration in coming up to me, 

next day, after service, in the Nave itself, with his gown still 

on, and expressing his hope that I had not been greatly alarmed or 

had my rest violently broken, I believe I might never have heard of 

that disgraceful transaction,' said the old lady.



'To be candid, Ma, I think I should have kept it from you if I 

could:  though I had not decidedly made up my mind.  I was 

following Jasper out, to confer with him on the subject, and to 

consider the expediency of his and my jointly hushing the thing up 

on all accounts, when I found him speaking to you.  Then it was too 

late.'



'Too late, indeed, Sept.  He was still as pale as gentlemanly ashes 

at what had taken place in his rooms overnight.'



'If I HAD kept it from you, Ma, you may be sure it would have been 

for your peace and quiet, and for the good of the young men, and in 

my best discharge of my duty according to my lights.'



The old lady immediately walked across the room and kissed him:  

saying, 'Of course, my dear Sept, I am sure of that.'



'However, it became the town-talk,' said Mr. Crisparkle, rubbing 

his ear, as his mother resumed her seat, and her knitting, 'and 

passed out of my power.'



'And I said then, Sept,' returned the old lady, 'that I thought ill 

of Mr. Neville.  And I say now, that I think ill of Mr. Neville.  

And I said then, and I say now, that I hope Mr. Neville may come to 

good, but I don't believe he will.'  Here the cap vibrated again 

considerably.



'I am sorry to hear you say so, Ma - '



'I am sorry to say so, my dear,' interposed the old lady, knitting 

on firmly, 'but I can't help it.'



' - For,' pursued the Minor Canon, 'it is undeniable that Mr. 

Neville is exceedingly industrious and attentive, and that he 

improves apace, and that he has - I hope I may say - an attachment 

to me.'



'There is no merit in the last article, my dear,' said the old 

lady, quickly; 'and if he says there is, I think the worse of him 

for the boast.'



'But, my dear Ma, he never said there was.'



'Perhaps not,' returned the old lady; 'still, I don't see that it 

greatly signifies.'



There was no impatience in the pleasant look with which Mr. 

Crisparkle contemplated the pretty old piece of china as it 

knitted; but there was, certainly, a humorous sense of its not 

being a piece of china to argue with very closely.



'Besides, Sept, ask yourself what he would be without his sister.  

You know what an influence she has over him; you know what a 

capacity she has; you know that whatever he reads with you, he 

reads with her.  Give her her fair share of your praise, and how 

much do you leave for him?'



At these words Mr. Crisparkle fell into a little reverie, in which 

he thought of several things.  He thought of the times he had seen 

the brother and sister together in deep converse over one of his 

own old college books; now, in the rimy mornings, when he made 

those sharpening pilgrimages to Cloisterham Weir; now, in the 

sombre evenings, when he faced the wind at sunset, having climbed 

his favourite outlook, a beetling fragment of monastery ruin; and 

the two studious figures passed below him along the margin of the 

river, in which the town fires and lights already shone, making the 

landscape bleaker.  He thought how the consciousness had stolen 

upon him that in teaching one, he was teaching two; and how he had 

almost insensibly adapted his explanations to both minds - that 

with which his own was daily in contact, and that which he only 

approached through it.  He thought of the gossip that had reached 

him from the Nuns' House, to the effect that Helena, whom he had 

mistrusted as so proud and fierce, submitted herself to the fairy-

bride (as he called her), and learnt from her what she knew.  He 

thought of the picturesque alliance between those two, externally 

so very different.  He thought - perhaps most of all - could it be 

that these things were yet but so many weeks old, and had become an 

integral part of his life?



As, whenever the Reverend Septimus fell a-musing, his good mother 

took it to be an infallible sign that he 'wanted support,' the 

blooming old lady made all haste to the dining-room closet, to 

produce from it the support embodied in a glass of Constantia and a 

home-made biscuit.  It was a most wonderful closet, worthy of 

Cloisterham and of Minor Canon Corner.  Above it, a portrait of 

Handel in a flowing wig beamed down at the spectator, with a 

knowing air of being up to the contents of the closet, and a 

musical air of intending to combine all its harmonies in one 

delicious fugue.  No common closet with a vulgar door on hinges, 

openable all at once, and leaving nothing to be disclosed by 

degrees, this rare closet had a lock in mid-air, where two 

perpendicular slides met; the one falling down, and the other 

pushing up.  The upper slide, on being pulled down (leaving the 

lower a double mystery), revealed deep shelves of pickle-jars, jam-

pots, tin canisters, spice-boxes, and agreeably outlandish vessels 

of blue and white, the luscious lodgings of preserved tamarinds and 

ginger.  Every benevolent inhabitant of this retreat had his name 

inscribed upon his stomach.  The pickles, in a uniform of rich 

brown double-breasted buttoned coat, and yellow or sombre drab 

continuations, announced their portly forms, in printed capitals, 

as Walnut, Gherkin, Onion, Cabbage, Cauliflower, Mixed, and other 

members of that noble family.  The jams, as being of a less 

masculine temperament, and as wearing curlpapers, announced 

themselves in feminine caligraphy, like a soft whisper, to be 

Raspberry, Gooseberry, Apricot, Plum, Damson, Apple, and Peach.  

The scene closing on these charmers, and the lower slide ascending, 

oranges were revealed, attended by a mighty japanned sugar-box, to 

temper their acerbity if unripe.  Home-made biscuits waited at the 

Court of these Powers, accompanied by a goodly fragment of plum-

cake, and various slender ladies' fingers, to be dipped into sweet 

wine and kissed.  Lowest of all, a compact leaden-vault enshrined 

the sweet wine and a stock of cordials:  whence issued whispers of 

Seville Orange, Lemon, Almond, and Caraway-seed.  There was a 

crowning air upon this closet of closets, of having been for ages 

hummed through by the Cathedral bell and organ, until those 

venerable bees had made sublimated honey of everything in store; 

and it was always observed that every dipper among the shelves 

(deep, as has been noticed, and swallowing up head, shoulders, and 

elbows) came forth again mellow-faced, and seeming to have 

undergone a saccharine transfiguration.



The Reverend Septimus yielded himself up quite as willing a victim 

to a nauseous medicinal herb-closet, also presided over by the 

china shepherdess, as to this glorious cupboard.  To what amazing 

infusions of gentian, peppermint, gilliflower, sage, parsley, 

thyme, rue, rosemary, and dandelion, did his courageous stomach 

submit itself!  In what wonderful wrappers, enclosing layers of 

dried leaves, would he swathe his rosy and contented face, if his 

mother suspected him of a toothache!  What botanical blotches would 

he cheerfully stick upon his cheek, or forehead, if the dear old 

lady convicted him of an imperceptible pimple there!  Into this 

herbaceous penitentiary, situated on an upper staircase-landing:  a 

low and narrow whitewashed cell, where bunches of dried leaves hung 

from rusty hooks in the ceiling, and were spread out upon shelves, 

in company with portentous bottles:  would the Reverend Septimus 

submissively be led, like the highly popular lamb who has so long 

and unresistingly been led to the slaughter, and there would he, 

unlike that lamb, bore nobody but himself.  Not even doing that 

much, so that the old lady were busy and pleased, he would quietly 

swallow what was given him, merely taking a corrective dip of hands 

and face into the great bowl of dried rose-leaves, and into the 

other great bowl of dried lavender, and then would go out, as 

confident in the sweetening powers of Cloisterham Weir and a 

wholesome mind, as Lady Macbeth was hopeless of those of all the 

seas that roll.



In the present instance the good Minor Canon took his glass of 

Constantia with an excellent grace, and, so supported to his 

mother's satisfaction, applied himself to the remaining duties of 

the day.  In their orderly and punctual progress they brought round 

Vesper Service and twilight.  The Cathedral being very cold, he set 

off for a brisk trot after service; the trot to end in a charge at 

his favourite fragment of ruin, which was to be carried by storm, 

without a pause for breath.



He carried it in a masterly manner, and, not breathed even then, 

stood looking down upon the river.  The river at Cloisterham is 

sufficiently near the sea to throw up oftentimes a quantity of 

seaweed.  An unusual quantity had come in with the last tide, and 

this, and the confusion of the water, and the restless dipping and 

flapping of the noisy gulls, and an angry light out seaward beyond 

the brown-sailed barges that were turning black, foreshadowed a 

stormy night.  In his mind he was contrasting the wild and noisy 

sea with the quiet harbour of Minor Canon Corner, when Helena and 

Neville Landless passed below him.  He had had the two together in 

his thoughts all day, and at once climbed down to speak to them 

together.  The footing was rough in an uncertain light for any 

tread save that of a good climber; but the Minor Canon was as good 

a climber as most men, and stood beside them before many good 

climbers would have been half-way down.



'A wild evening, Miss Landless!  Do you not find your usual walk 

with your brother too exposed and cold for the time of year?  Or at 

all events, when the sun is down, and the weather is driving in 

from the sea?'



Helena thought not.  It was their favourite walk.  It was very 

retired.



'It is very retired,' assented Mr. Crisparkle, laying hold of his 

opportunity straightway, and walking on with them.  'It is a place 

of all others where one can speak without interruption, as I wish 

to do.  Mr. Neville, I believe you tell your sister everything that 

passes between us?'



'Everything, sir.'



'Consequently,' said Mr. Crisparkle, 'your sister is aware that I 

have repeatedly urged you to make some kind of apology for that 

unfortunate occurrence which befell on the night of your arrival 

here.'  In saying it he looked to her, and not to him; therefore it 

was she, and not he, who replied:



'Yes.'



'I call it unfortunate, Miss Helena,' resumed Mr. Crisparkle, 

'forasmuch as it certainly has engendered a prejudice against 

Neville.  There is a notion about, that he is a dangerously 

passionate fellow, of an uncontrollable and furious temper:  he is 

really avoided as such.'



'I have no doubt he is, poor fellow,' said Helena, with a look of 

proud compassion at her brother, expressing a deep sense of his 

being ungenerously treated.  'I should be quite sure of it, from 

your saying so; but what you tell me is confirmed by suppressed 

hints and references that I meet with every day.'



'Now,' Mr. Crisparkle again resumed, in a tone of mild though firm 

persuasion, 'is not this to be regretted, and ought it not to be 

amended?  These are early days of Neville's in Cloisterham, and I 

have no fear of his outliving such a prejudice, and proving himself 

to have been misunderstood.  But how much wiser to take action at 

once, than to trust to uncertain time!  Besides, apart from its 

being politic, it is right.  For there can be no question that 

Neville was wrong.'



'He was provoked,' Helena submitted.



'He was the assailant,' Mr. Crisparkle submitted.



They walked on in silence, until Helena raised her eyes to the 

Minor Canon's face, and said, almost reproachfully:  'O Mr. 

Crisparkle, would you have Neville throw himself at young Drood's 

feet, or at Mr. Jasper's, who maligns him every day?  In your heart 

you cannot mean it.  From your heart you could not do it, if his 

case were yours.'



'I have represented to Mr. Crisparkle, Helena,' said Neville, with 

a glance of deference towards his tutor, 'that if I could do it 

from my heart, I would.  But I cannot, and I revolt from the 

pretence.  You forget however, that to put the case to Mr. 

Crisparkle as his own, is to  suppose to have done what I did.'



'I ask his pardon,' said Helena.



'You see,' remarked Mr. Crisparkle, again laying hold of his 

opportunity, though with a moderate and delicate touch, 'you both 

instinctively acknowledge that Neville did wrong.  Then why stop 

short, and not otherwise acknowledge it?'



'Is there no difference,' asked Helena, with a little faltering in 

her manner; 'between submission to a generous spirit, and 

submission to a base or trivial one?'



Before the worthy Minor Canon was quite ready with his argument in 

reference to this nice distinction, Neville struck in:



'Help me to clear myself with Mr. Crisparkle, Helena.  Help me to 

convince him that I cannot be the first to make concessions without 

mockery and falsehood.  My nature must be changed before I can do 

so, and it is not changed.  I am sensible of inexpressible affront, 

and deliberate aggravation of inexpressible affront, and I am 

angry.  The plain truth is, I am still as angry when I recall that 

night as I was that night.'



'Neville,' hinted the Minor Canon, with a steady countenance, 'you 

have repeated that former action of your hands, which I so much 

dislike.'



'I am sorry for it, sir, but it was involuntary.  I confessed that 

I was still as angry.'



'And I confess,' said Mr. Crisparkle, 'that I hoped for better 

things.'



'I am sorry to disappoint you, sir, but it would be far worse to 

deceive you, and I should deceive you grossly if I pretended that 

you had softened me in this respect.  The time may come when your 

powerful influence will do even that with the difficult pupil whose 

antecedents you know; but it has not come yet.  Is this so, and in 

spite of my struggles against myself, Helena?'



She, whose dark eyes were watching the effect of what he said on 

Mr. Crisparkle's face, replied - to Mr. Crisparkle, not to him:  

'It is so.'  After a short pause, she answered the slightest look 

of inquiry conceivable, in her brother's eyes, with as slight an 

affirmative bend of her own head; and he went on:



'I have never yet had the courage to say to you, sir, what in full 

openness I ought to have said when you first talked with me on this 

subject.  It is not easy to say, and I have been withheld by a fear 

of its seeming ridiculous, which is very strong upon me down to 

this last moment, and might, but for my sister, prevent my being 

quite open with you even now. - I admire Miss Bud, sir, so very 

much, that I cannot bear her being treated with conceit or 

indifference; and even if I did not feel that I had an injury 

against young Drood on my own account, I should feel that I had an 

injury against him on hers.'



Mr. Crisparkle, in utter amazement, looked at Helena for 

corroboration, and met in her expressive face full corroboration, 

and a plea for advice.



'The young lady of whom you speak is, as you know, Mr. Neville, 

shortly to be married,' said Mr. Crisparkle, gravely; 'therefore 

your admiration, if it be of that special nature which you seem to 

indicate, is outrageously misplaced.  Moreover, it is monstrous 

that you should take upon yourself to be the young lady's champion 

against her chosen husband.  Besides, you have seen them only once.  

The young lady has become your sister's friend; and I wonder that 

your sister, even on her behalf, has not checked you in this 

irrational and culpable fancy.'



'She has tried, sir, but uselessly.  Husband or no husband, that 

fellow is incapable of the feeling with which I am inspired towards 

the beautiful young creature whom he treats like a doll.  I say he 

is as incapable of it, as he is unworthy of her.  I say she is 

sacrificed in being bestowed upon him.  I say that I love her, and 

despise and hate him!'  This with a face so flushed, and a gesture 

so violent, that his sister crossed to his side, and caught his 

arm, remonstrating, 'Neville, Neville!'



Thus recalled to himself, he quickly became sensible of having lost 

the guard he had set upon his passionate tendency, and covered his 

face with his hand, as one repentant and wretched.



Mr. Crisparkle, watching him attentively, and at the same time 

meditating how to proceed, walked on for some paces in silence.  

Then he spoke:



'Mr. Neville, Mr. Neville, I am sorely grieved to see in you more 

traces of a character as sullen, angry, and wild, as the night now 

closing in.  They are of too serious an aspect to leave me the 

resource of treating the infatuation you have disclosed, as 

undeserving serious consideration.  I give it very serious 

consideration, and I speak to you accordingly.  This feud between 

you and young Drood must not go on.  I cannot permit it to go on 

any longer, knowing what I now know from you, and you living under 

my roof.  Whatever prejudiced and unauthorised constructions your 

blind and envious wrath may put upon his character, it is a frank, 

good-natured character.  I know I can trust to it for that.  Now, 

pray observe what I am about to say.  On reflection, and on your 

sister's representation, I am willing to admit that, in making 

peace with young Drood, you have a right to be met half-way.  I 

will engage that you shall be, and even that young Drood shall make 

the first advance.  This condition fulfilled, you will pledge me 

the honour of a Christian gentleman that the quarrel is for ever at 

an end on your side.  What may be in your heart when you give him 

your hand, can only be known to the Searcher of all hearts; but it 

will never go well with you, if there be any treachery there.  So 

far, as to that; next as to what I must again speak of as your 

infatuation.  I understand it to have been confided to me, and to 

be known to no other person save your sister and yourself.  Do I 

understand aright?'



Helena answered in a low voice:  'It is only known to us three who 

are here together.'



'It is not at all known to the young lady, your friend?'



'On my soul, no!'



'I require you, then, to give me your similar and solemn pledge, 

Mr. Neville, that it shall remain the secret it is, and that you 

will take no other action whatsoever upon it than endeavouring (and 

that most earnestly) to erase it from your mind.  I will not tell 

you that it will soon pass; I will not tell you that it is the 

fancy of the moment; I will not tell you that such caprices have 

their rise and fall among the young and ardent every hour; I will 

leave you undisturbed in the belief that it has few parallels or 

none, that it will abide with you a long time, and that it will be 

very difficult to conquer.  So much the more weight shall I attach 

to the pledge I require from you, when it is unreservedly given.'



The young man twice or thrice essayed to speak, but failed.



'Let me leave you with your sister, whom it is time you took home,' 

said Mr. Crisparkle.  'You will find me alone in my room by-and-

by.'



'Pray do not leave us yet,' Helena implored him.  'Another minute.'



'I should not,' said Neville, pressing his hand upon his face, 

'have needed so much as another minute, if you had been less 

patient with me, Mr. Crisparkle, less considerate of me, and less 

unpretendingly good and true.  O, if in my childhood I had known 

such a guide!'



'Follow your guide now, Neville,' murmured Helena, 'and follow him 

to Heaven!'



There was that in her tone which broke the good Minor Canon's 

voice, or it would have repudiated her exaltation of him.  As it 

was, he laid a finger on his lips, and looked towards her brother.



'To say that I give both pledges, Mr. Crisparkle, out of my 

innermost heart, and to say that there is no treachery in it, is to 

say nothing!'  Thus Neville, greatly moved.  'I beg your 

forgiveness for my miserable lapse into a burst of passion.'



'Not mine, Neville, not mine.  You know with whom forgiveness lies, 

as the highest attribute conceivable.  Miss Helena, you and your 

brother are twin children.  You came into this world with the same 

dispositions, and you passed your younger days together surrounded 

by the same adverse circumstances.  What you have overcome in 

yourself, can you not overcome in him?  You see the rock that lies 

in his course.  Who but you can keep him clear of it?'



'Who but you, sir?' replied Helena.  'What is my influence, or my 

weak wisdom, compared with yours!'



'You have the wisdom of Love,' returned the Minor Canon, 'and it 

was the highest wisdom ever known upon this earth, remember.  As to 

mine - but the less said of that commonplace commodity the better.  

Good night!'



She took the hand he offered her, and gratefully and almost 

reverently raised it to her lips.



'Tut!' said the Minor Canon softly, 'I am much overpaid!' and 

turned away.



Retracing his steps towards the Cathedral Close, he tried, as he 

went along in the dark, to think out the best means of bringing to 

pass what he had promised to effect, and what must somehow be done.  

'I shall probably be asked to marry them,' he reflected, 'and I 

would they were married and gone!  But this presses first.'



He debated principally whether he should write to young Drood, or 

whether he should speak to Jasper.  The consciousness of being 

popular with the whole Cathedral establishment inclined him to the 

latter course, and the well-timed sight of the lighted gatehouse 

decided him to take it.  'I will strike while the iron is hot,' he 

said, 'and see him now.'



Jasper was lying asleep on a couch before the fire, when, having 

ascended the postern-stair, and received no answer to his knock at 

the door, Mr. Crisparkle gently turned the handle and looked in.  

Long afterwards he had cause to remember how Jasper sprang from the 

couch in a delirious state between sleeping and waking, and crying 

out:  'What is the matter?  Who did it?'



'It is only I, Jasper.  I am sorry to have disturbed you.'



The glare of his eyes settled down into a look of recognition, and 

he moved a chair or two, to make a way to the fireside.



'I was dreaming at a great rate, and am glad to be disturbed from 

an indigestive after-dinner sleep.  Not to mention that you are 

always welcome.'



'Thank you.  I am not confident,' returned Mr. Crisparkle, as he 

sat himself down in the easy-chair placed for him, 'that my subject 

will at first sight be quite as welcome as myself; but I am a 

minister of peace, and I pursue my subject in the interests of 

peace.  In a word, Jasper, I want to establish peace between these 

two young fellows.'



A very perplexed expression took hold of Mr. Jasper's face; a very 

perplexing expression too, for Mr. Crisparkle could make nothing of 

it.



'How?' was Jasper's inquiry, in a low and slow voice, after a 

silence.



'For the "How" I come to you.  I want to ask you to do me the great 

favour and service of interposing with your nephew (I have already 

interposed with Mr. Neville), and getting him to write you a short 

note, in his lively way, saying that he is willing to shake hands.  

I know what a good-natured fellow he is, and what influence you 

have with him.  And without in the least defending Mr. Neville, we 

must all admit that he was bitterly stung.'



Jasper turned that perplexed face towards the fire.  Mr. Crisparkle 

continuing to observe it, found it even more perplexing than 

before, inasmuch as it seemed to denote (which could hardly be) 

some close internal calculation.



'I know that you are not prepossessed in Mr. Neville's favour,' the 

Minor Canon was going on, when Jasper stopped him:



'You have cause to say so.  I am not, indeed.'



'Undoubtedly; and I admit his lamentable violence of temper, though 

I hope he and I will get the better of it between us.  But I have 

exacted a very solemn promise from him as to his future demeanour 

towards your nephew, if you do kindly interpose; and I am sure he 

will keep it.'



'You are always responsible and trustworthy, Mr. Crisparkle.  Do 

you really feel sure that you can answer for him so confidently?'



'I do.'



The perplexed and perplexing look vanished.



'Then you relieve my mind of a great dread, and a heavy weight,' 

said Jasper; 'I will do it.'



Mr. Crisparkle, delighted by the swiftness and completeness of his 

success, acknowledged it in the handsomest terms.



'I will do it,' repeated Jasper, 'for the comfort of having your 

guarantee against my vague and unfounded fears.  You will laugh - 

but do you keep a Diary?'



'A line for a day; not more.'



'A line for a day would be quite as much as my uneventful life 

would need, Heaven knows,' said Jasper, taking a book from a desk, 

'but that my Diary is, in fact, a Diary of Ned's life too.  You 

will laugh at this entry; you will guess when it was made:





'"Past midnight. - After what I have just now seen, I have a morbid 

dread upon me of some horrible consequences resulting to my dear 

boy, that I cannot reason with or in any way contend against.  All 

my efforts are vain.  The demoniacal passion of this Neville 

Landless, his strength in his fury, and his savage rage for the 

destruction of its object, appal me.  So profound is the 

impression, that twice since I have gone into my dear boy's room, 

to assure myself of his sleeping safely, and not lying dead in his 

blood."





'Here is another entry next morning:





'"Ned up and away.  Light-hearted and unsuspicious as ever.  He 

laughed when I cautioned him, and said he was as good a man as 

Neville Landless any day.  I told him that might be, but he was not 

as bad a man.  He continued to make light of it, but I travelled 

with him as far as I could, and left him most unwillingly.  I am 

unable to shake off these dark intangible presentiments of evil - 

if feelings founded upon staring facts are to be so called."





'Again and again,' said Jasper, in conclusion, twirling the leaves 

of the book before putting it by, 'I have relapsed into these 

moods, as other entries show.  But I have now your assurance at my 

back, and shall put it in my book, and make it an antidote to my 

black humours.'



'Such an antidote, I hope,' returned Mr. Crisparkle, 'as will 

induce you before long to consign the black humours to the flames.  

I ought to be the last to find any fault with you this evening, 

when you have met my wishes so freely; but I must say, Jasper, that 

your devotion to your nephew has made you exaggerative here.'



'You are my witness,' said Jasper, shrugging his shoulders, 'what 

my state of mind honestly was, that night, before I sat down to 

write, and in what words I expressed it.  You remember objecting to 

a word I used, as being too strong?  It was a stronger word than 

any in my Diary.'



'Well, well.  Try the antidote,' rejoined Mr. Crisparkle; 'and may 

it give you a brighter and better view of the case!  We will 

discuss it no more now.  I have to thank you for myself, thank you 

sincerely.'



'You shall find,' said Jasper, as they shook hands, 'that I will 

not do the thing you wish me to do, by halves.  I will take care 

that Ned, giving way at all, shall give way thoroughly.'



On the third day after this conversation, he called on Mr. 

Crisparkle with the following letter:





'MY DEAR JACK,



'I am touched by your account of your interview with Mr. 

Crisparkle, whom I much respect and esteem.  At once I openly say 

that I forgot myself on that occasion quite as much as Mr. Landless 

did, and that I wish that bygone to be a bygone, and all to be 

right again.



'Look here, dear old boy.  Ask Mr. Landless to dinner on Christmas 

Eve (the better the day the better the deed), and let there be only 

we three, and let us shake hands all round there and then, and say 

no more about it.



'My dear Jack,

'Ever your most affectionate,

'EDWIN DROOD.



'P.S.  Love to Miss Pussy at the next music-lesson.'





'You expect Mr. Neville, then?' said Mr. Crisparkle.



'I count upon his coming,' said Mr. Jasper.
