NOTHING occurred in the night to flutter the tired dove; and the 

dove arose refreshed.  With Mr. Grewgious, when the clock struck 

ten in the morning, came Mr. Crisparkle, who had come at one plunge 

out of the river at Cloisterham.



'Miss Twinkleton was so uneasy, Miss Rosa,' he explained to her, 

'and came round to Ma and me with your note, in such a state of 

wonder, that, to quiet her, I volunteered on this service by the 

very first train to be caught in the morning.  I wished at the time 

that you had come to me; but now I think it best that you did AS 

you did, and came to your guardian.'



'I did think of you,' Rosa told him; 'but Minor Canon Corner was so 

near him - '



'I understand.  It was quite natural.'



'I have told Mr. Crisparkle,' said Mr. Grewgious, 'all that you 

told me last night, my dear.  Of course I should have written it to 

him immediately; but his coming was most opportune.  And it was 

particularly kind of him to come, for he had but just gone.'



'Have you settled,' asked Rosa, appealing to them both, 'what is to 

be done for Helena and her brother?'



'Why really,' said Mr. Crisparkle, 'I am in great perplexity.  If 

even Mr. Grewgious, whose head is much longer than mine, and who is 

a whole night's cogitation in advance of me, is undecided, what 

must I be!'



The Unlimited here put her head in at the door - after having 

rapped, and been authorised to present herself - announcing that a 

gentleman wished for a word with another gentleman named 

Crisparkle, if any such gentleman were there.  If no such gentleman 

were there, he begged pardon for being mistaken.



'Such a gentleman is here,' said Mr. Crisparkle, 'but is engaged 

just now.'



'Is it a dark gentleman?' interposed Rosa, retreating on her 

guardian.



'No, Miss, more of a brown gentleman.'



'You are sure not with black hair?' asked Rosa, taking courage.



'Quite sure of that, Miss.  Brown hair and blue eyes.'



'Perhaps,' hinted Mr. Grewgious, with habitual caution, 'it might 

be well to see him, reverend sir, if you don't object.  When one is 

in a difficulty or at a loss, one never knows in what direction a 

way out may chance to open.  It is a business principle of mine, in 

such a case, not to close up any direction, but to keep an eye on 

every direction that may present itself.  I could relate an 

anecdote in point, but that it would be premature.'



'If Miss Rosa will allow me, then?  Let the gentleman come in,' 

said Mr. Crisparkle.



The gentleman came in; apologised, with a frank but modest grace, 

for not finding Mr. Crisparkle alone; turned to Mr. Crisparkle, and 

smilingly asked the unexpected question:  'Who am I?'



'You are the gentleman I saw smoking under the trees in Staple Inn, 

a few minutes ago.'



'True.  There I saw you.  Who else am I?'



Mr. Crisparkle concentrated his attention on a handsome face, much 

sunburnt; and the ghost of some departed boy seemed to rise, 

gradually and dimly, in the room.



The gentleman saw a struggling recollection lighten up the Minor 

Canon's features, and smiling again, said:  'What will you have for 

breakfast this morning?  You are out of jam.'



'Wait a moment!' cried Mr. Crisparkle, raising his right hand.  

'Give me another instant!  Tartar!'



The two shook hands with the greatest heartiness, and then went the 

wonderful length - for Englishmen - of laying their hands each on 

the other's shoulders, and looking joyfully each into the other's 

face.



'My old fag!' said Mr. Crisparkle.



'My old master!' said Mr. Tartar.



'You saved me from drowning!' said Mr. Crisparkle.



'After which you took to swimming, you know!' said Mr. Tartar.



'God bless my soul!' said Mr. Crisparkle.



'Amen!' said Mr. Tartar.



And then they fell to shaking hands most heartily again.



'Imagine,' exclaimed Mr. Crisparkle, with glistening eyes:  'Miss 

Rosa Bud and Mr. Grewgious, imagine Mr. Tartar, when he was the 

smallest of juniors, diving for me, catching me, a big heavy 

senior, by the hair of the head, and striking out for the shore 

with me like a water-giant!'



'Imagine my not letting him sink, as I was his fag!' said Mr. 

Tartar.  'But the truth being that he was my best protector and 

friend, and did me more good than all the masters put together, an 

irrational impulse seized me to pick him up, or go down with him.'



'Hem!  Permit me, sir, to have the honour,' said Mr. Grewgious, 

advancing with extended hand, 'for an honour I truly esteem it.  I 

am proud to make your acquaintance.  I hope you didn't take cold.  

I hope you were not inconvenienced by swallowing too much water.  

How have you been since?'



It was by no means apparent that Mr. Grewgious knew what he said, 

though it was very apparent that he meant to say something highly 

friendly and appreciative.



If Heaven, Rosa thought, had but sent such courage and skill to her 

poor mother's aid!  And he to have been so slight and young then!



'I don't wish to be complimented upon it, I thank you; but I think 

I have an idea,' Mr. Grewgious announced, after taking a jog-trot 

or two across the room, so unexpected and unaccountable that they 

all stared at him, doubtful whether he was choking or had the cramp 

- 'I THINK I have an idea.  I believe I have had the pleasure of 

seeing Mr. Tartar's name as tenant of the top set in the house next 

the top set in the corner?'



'Yes, sir,' returned Mr. Tartar.  'You are right so far.'



'I am right so far,' said Mr. Grewgious.  'Tick that off;' which he 

did, with his right thumb on his left.  'Might you happen to know 

the name of your neighbour in the top set on the other side of the 

party-wall?' coming very close to Mr. Tartar, to lose nothing of 

his face, in his shortness of sight.



'Landless.'



'Tick that off,' said Mr. Grewgious, taking another trot, and then 

coming back.  'No personal knowledge, I suppose, sir?'



'Slight, but some.'



'Tick that off,' said Mr. Grewgious, taking another trot, and again 

coming back.  'Nature of knowledge, Mr. Tartar?'



'I thought he seemed to be a young fellow in a poor way, and I 

asked his leave - only within a day or so - to share my flowers up 

there with him; that is to say, to extend my flower-garden to his 

windows.'



'Would you have the kindness to take seats?' said Mr. Grewgious.  

'I HAVE an idea!'



They complied; Mr. Tartar none the less readily, for being all 

abroad; and Mr. Grewgious, seated in the centre, with his hands 

upon his knees, thus stated his idea, with his usual manner of 

having got the statement by heart.



'I cannot as yet make up my mind whether it is prudent to hold open 

communication under present circumstances, and on the part of the 

fair member of the present company, with Mr. Neville or Miss 

Helena.  I have reason to know that a local friend of ours (on whom 

I beg to bestow a passing but a hearty malediction, with the kind 

permission of my reverend friend) sneaks to and fro, and dodges up 

and down.  When not doing so himself, he may have some informant 

skulking about, in the person of a watchman, porter, or such-like 

hanger-on of Staple.  On the other hand, Miss Rosa very naturally 

wishes to see her friend Miss Helena, and it would seem important 

that at least Miss Helena (if not her brother too, through her) 

should privately know from Miss Rosa's lips what has occurred, and 

what has been threatened.  Am I agreed with generally in the views 

I take?'



'I entirely coincide with them,' said Mr. Crisparkle, who had been 

very attentive.



'As I have no doubt I should,' added Mr. Tartar, smiling, 'if I 

understood them.'



'Fair and softly, sir,' said Mr. Grewgious; 'we shall fully confide 

in you directly, if you will favour us with your permission.  Now, 

if our local friend should have any informant on the spot, it is 

tolerably clear that such informant can only be set to watch the 

chambers in the occupation of Mr. Neville.  He reporting, to our 

local friend, who comes and goes there, our local friend would 

supply for himself, from his own previous knowledge, the identity 

of the parties.  Nobody can be set to watch all Staple, or to 

concern himself with comers and goers to other sets of chambers:  

unless, indeed, mine.'



'I begin to understand to what you tend,' said Mr. Crisparkle, 'and 

highly approve of your caution.'



'I needn't repeat that I know nothing yet of the why and 

wherefore,' said Mr. Tartar; 'but I also understand to what you 

tend, so let me say at once that my chambers are freely at your 

disposal.'



'There!' cried Mr. Grewgious, smoothing his head triumphantly, 'now 

we have all got the idea.  You have it, my dear?'



'I think I have,' said Rosa, blushing a little as Mr. Tartar looked 

quickly towards her.



'You see, you go over to Staple with Mr. Crisparkle and Mr. 

Tartar,' said Mr. Grewgious; 'I going in and out, and out and in 

alone, in my usual way; you go up with those gentlemen to Mr. 

Tartar's rooms; you look into Mr. Tartar's flower-garden; you wait 

for Miss Helena's appearance there, or you signify to Miss Helena 

that you are close by; and you communicate with her freely, and no 

spy can be the wiser.'



'I am very much afraid I shall be - '



'Be what, my dear?' asked Mr. Grewgious, as she hesitated.  'Not 

frightened?'



'No, not that,' said Rosa, shyly; 'in Mr. Tartar's way.  We seem to 

be appropriating Mr. Tartar's residence so very coolly.'



'I protest to you,' returned that gentleman, 'that I shall think 

the better of it for evermore, if your voice sounds in it only 

once.'



Rosa, not quite knowing what to say about that, cast down her eyes, 

and turning to Mr. Grewgious, dutifully asked if she should put her 

hat on?  Mr. Grewgious being of opinion that she could not do 

better, she withdrew for the purpose.  Mr. Crisparkle took the 

opportunity of giving Mr. Tartar a summary of the distresses of 

Neville and his sister; the opportunity was quite long enough, as 

the hat happened to require a little extra fitting on.



Mr. Tartar gave his arm to Rosa, and Mr. Crisparkle walked, 

detached, in front.



'Poor, poor Eddy!' thought Rosa, as they went along.



Mr. Tartar waved his right hand as he bent his head down over Rosa, 

talking in an animated way.



'It was not so powerful or so sun-browned when it saved Mr. 

Crisparkle,' thought Rosa, glancing at it; 'but it must have been 

very steady and determined even then.'



Mr. Tartar told her he had been a sailor, roving everywhere for 

years and years.



'When are you going to sea again?' asked Rosa.



'Never!'



Rosa wondered what the girls would say if they could see her 

crossing the wide street on the sailor's arm.  And she fancied that 

the passers-by must think her very little and very helpless, 

contrasted with the strong figure that could have caught her up and 

carried her out of any danger, miles and miles without resting.



She was thinking further, that his far-seeing blue eyes looked as 

if they had been used to watch danger afar off, and to watch it 

without flinching, drawing nearer and nearer:  when, happening to 

raise her own eyes, she found that he seemed to be thinking 

something about THEM.



This a little confused Rosebud, and may account for her never 

afterwards quite knowing how she ascended (with his help) to his 

garden in the air, and seemed to get into a marvellous country that 

came into sudden bloom like the country on the summit of the magic 

bean-stalk.  May it flourish for ever!
