CHAPTER I - THE DAWN




AN ancient English Cathedral Tower?  How can the ancient English 

Cathedral tower be here!  The well-known massive gray square tower 

of its old Cathedral?  How can that be here!  There is no spike of 

rusty iron in the air, between the eye and it, from any point of 

the real prospect.  What is the spike that intervenes, and who has 

set it up?  Maybe it is set up by the Sultan's orders for the 

impaling of a horde of Turkish robbers, one by one.  It is so, for 

cymbals clash, and the Sultan goes by to his palace in long 

procession.  Ten thousand scimitars flash in the sunlight, and 

thrice ten thousand dancing-girls strew flowers.  Then, follow 

white elephants caparisoned in countless gorgeous colours, and 

infinite in number and attendants.  Still the Cathedral Tower rises 

in the background, where it cannot be, and still no writhing figure 

is on the grim spike.  Stay!  Is the spike so low a thing as the 

rusty spike on the top of a post of an old bedstead that has 

tumbled all awry?  Some vague period of drowsy laughter must be 

devoted to the consideration of this possibility.



Shaking from head to foot, the man whose scattered consciousness 

has thus fantastically pieced itself together, at length rises, 

supports his trembling frame upon his arms, and looks around.  He 

is in the meanest and closest of small rooms.  Through the ragged 

window-curtain, the light of early day steals in from a miserable 

court.  He lies, dressed, across a large unseemly bed, upon a 

bedstead that has indeed given way under the weight upon it. Lying, 

also dressed and also across the bed, not longwise, are a Chinaman, 

a Lascar, and a haggard woman.  The two first are in a sleep or 

stupor; the last is blowing at a kind of pipe, to kindle it.  And 

as she blows, and shading it with her lean hand, concentrates its 

red spark of light, it serves in the dim morning as a lamp to show 

him what he sees of her.



'Another?' says this woman, in a querulous, rattling whisper.  

'Have another?'



He looks about him, with his hand to his forehead.



'Ye've smoked as many as five since ye come in at midnight,' the 

woman goes on, as she chronically complains.  'Poor me, poor me, my 

head is so bad.  Them two come in after ye.  Ah, poor me, the 

business is slack, is slack!  Few Chinamen about the Docks, and 

fewer Lascars, and no ships coming in, these say!  Here's another 

ready for ye, deary.  Ye'll remember like a good soul, won't ye, 

that the market price is dreffle high just now?  More nor three 

shillings and sixpence for a thimbleful!  And ye'll remember that 

nobody but me (and Jack Chinaman t'other side the court; but he 

can't do it as well as me) has the true secret of mixing it?  Ye'll 

pay up accordingly, deary, won't ye?'



She blows at the pipe as she speaks, and, occasionally bubbling at 

it, inhales much of its contents.



'O me, O me, my lungs is weak, my lungs is bad!  It's nearly ready 

for ye, deary.  Ah, poor me, poor me, my poor hand shakes like to 

drop off!  I see ye coming-to, and I ses to my poor self, "I'll 

have another ready for him, and he'll bear in mind the market price 

of opium, and pay according."  O my poor head!  I makes my pipes of 

old penny ink-bottles, ye see, deary - this is one - and I fits-in 

a mouthpiece, this way, and I takes my mixter out of this thimble 

with this little horn spoon; and so I fills, deary.  Ah, my poor 

nerves!  I got Heavens-hard drunk for sixteen year afore I took to 

this; but this don't hurt me, not to speak of.  And it takes away 

the hunger as well as wittles, deary.'



She hands him the nearly-emptied pipe, and sinks back, turning over 

on her face.



He rises unsteadily from the bed, lays the pipe upon the hearth-

stone, draws back the ragged curtain, and looks with repugnance at 

his three companions.  He notices that the woman has opium-smoked 

herself into a strange likeness of the Chinaman.  His form of 

cheek, eye, and temple, and his colour, are repeated in her.  Said 

Chinaman convulsively wrestles with one of his many Gods or Devils, 

perhaps, and snarls horribly.  The Lascar laughs and dribbles at 

the mouth.  The hostess is still.



'What visions can SHE have?' the waking man muses, as he turns her 

face towards him, and stands looking down at it.  'Visions of many 

butchers' shops, and public-houses, and much credit?  Of an 

increase of hideous customers, and this horrible bedstead set 

upright again, and this horrible court swept clean?  What can she 

rise to, under any quantity of opium, higher than that! - Eh?'



He bends down his ear, to listen to her mutterings.



'Unintelligible!'



As he watches the spasmodic shoots and darts that break out of her 

face and limbs, like fitful lightning out of a dark sky, some 

contagion in them seizes upon him:  insomuch that he has to 

withdraw himself to a lean arm-chair by the hearth - placed there, 

perhaps, for such emergencies - and to sit in it, holding tight, 

until he has got the better of this unclean spirit of imitation.



Then he comes back, pounces on the Chinaman, and seizing him with 

both hands by the throat, turns him violently on the bed.  The 

Chinaman clutches the aggressive hands, resists, gasps, and 

protests.



'What do you say?'



A watchful pause.



'Unintelligible!'



Slowly loosening his grasp as he listens to the incoherent jargon 

with an attentive frown, he turns to the Lascar and fairly drags 

him forth upon the floor.  As he falls, the Lascar starts into a 

half-risen attitude, glares with his eyes, lashes about him 

fiercely with his arms, and draws a phantom knife.  It then becomes 

apparent that the woman has taken possession of this knife, for 

safety's sake; for, she too starting up, and restraining and 

expostulating with him, the knife is visible in her dress, not in 

his, when they drowsily drop back, side by side.



There has been chattering and clattering enough between them, but 

to no purpose.  When any distinct word has been flung into the air, 

it has had no sense or sequence.  Wherefore 'unintelligible!' is 

again the comment of the watcher, made with some reassured nodding 

of his head, and a gloomy smile.  He then lays certain silver money 

on the table, finds his hat, gropes his way down the broken stairs, 

gives a good morning to some rat-ridden doorkeeper, in bed in a 

black hutch beneath the stairs, and passes out.





That same afternoon, the massive gray square tower of an old 

Cathedral rises before the sight of a jaded traveller.  The bells 

are going for daily vesper service, and he must needs attend it, 

one would say, from his haste to reach the open Cathedral door.  

The choir are getting on their sullied white robes, in a hurry, 

when he arrives among them, gets on his own robe, and falls into 

the procession filing in to service.  Then, the Sacristan locks the 

iron-barred gates that divide the sanctuary from the chancel, and 

all of the procession having scuttled into their places, hide their 

faces; and then the intoned words, 'WHEN THE WICKED MAN - ' rise 

among groins of arches and beams of roof, awakening muttered 

thunder.
