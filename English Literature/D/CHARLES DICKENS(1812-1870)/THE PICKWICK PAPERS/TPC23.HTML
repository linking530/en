<CENTER><FONT SIZE=-1>IN WHICH MR. SAMUEL WELLER BEGINS TO DEVOTE HIS ENERGIES
TO THE RETURN MATCH BETWEEN HIMSELF AND MR. TROTTER</FONT></CENTER>


<P>I<FONT SIZE=-1>N</FONT> a small room in the vicinity of the stable-yard,
betimes in the morning, which was ushered in by Mr. Pickwick's adventure
with the middle-aged lady in the yellow curlpapers, sat Mr. Weller senior,
preparing himself for his journey to London. He was sitting in an excellent
attitude for having his portrait taken.

<P>It is very possible that at some earlier period of his career, Mr. Weller's
profile might have presented a bold and determined outline. His face, however,
had expanded under the influence of good living, and a disposition remarkable
for resignation; and its bold fleshly curves had so far extended beyond
the limits originally assigned them, that unless you took a full view of
his countenance in front, it was difficult to distinguish more than the
extreme tip of a very rubicund nose. His chin, from the same cause, had
acquired the grave and imposing form which is generally described by prefixing
the word "double" to that expressive feature; and his complexion exhibited
that peculiarly mottled combination of colours which is only to be seen
in gentlemen of his profession, and in underdone roast beef. Round his
neck he wore a crimson travelling shawl, which merged into his chin by
such imperceptible gradations, that it was difficult to distinguish the
folds of the one, from the folds of the other. Over this, he mounted a
long waistcoat of a broad pink-striped pattern, and over that again, a
wide-skirted green coat, ornamented with large brass buttons, whereof the
two which garnished the waist, were so far apart, that no man had ever
beheld them both, at the same time. His hair, which was short, sleek, and
black, was just visible beneath the capacious brim of a low-crowned brown
hat. His legs were encased in knee-cord breeches, and painted top-boots:
and a copper watch-chain, terminating in one seal, and a key of the same
material, dangled loosely from his capacious waistband.

<P>We have said that Mr. Weller was engaged in preparing for his journey
to London--he was taking sustenance, in fact. On the table before him,
stood a pot of ale, a cold round of beef, and a very respectable-looking
loaf, to each of which he distributed his favours in turn, with the most
rigid impartiality. He had just cut a mighty slice from the latter, when
the footsteps of somebody entering the room, caused him to raise his head;
and he beheld his son.

<P>"Mornin', Sammy!" said the father.

<P>The son walked up to the pot of ale, and nodding significantly to his
parent, took a long draught by way of reply.

<P>"Wery good power o' suction, Sammy," said Mr. Weller the elder, looking
into the pot, when his first-born had set it down half empty. "You'd ha'
made an uncommon fine oyster, Sammy, if you'd been born in that station
o' life." "Yes, I des-say I should ha' managed to pick up a respectable
livin'," replied Sam, applying himself to the cold beef, with considerable
vigour.

<P>"I'm wery sorry, Sammy," said the elder Mr. Weller, shaking up the ale,
by describing small circles with the pot, preparatory to drinking. "I'm
wery sorry, Sammy, to hear from your lips, as you let yourself be gammoned
by that 'ere mulberry man. I always thought, up to three days ago, that
the names of Veller and gammon could never come into contract, Sammy, never."

<P>"Always exceptin' the case of a widder, of course," said Sam.

<P>"Widders, Sammy," replied Mr. Weller, slightly changing colour. "Widders
are 'ceptions to ev'ry rule. I <I>have</I> heerd how many ord'nary women,
one widder's equal to, in pint o' comin' over you. I think it's five-and-twenty,
but I don't rightly know vether it an't more."

<P>"Well; that's pretty well," said Sam.

<P>"Besides," continued Mr. Weller, not noticing the interruption, "that's
a wery different thing. You know what the counsel said, Sammy, as defended
the gen'l'm'n as beat his wife with the poker, venever he got jolly. `And
arter all, my Lord,' says he, `it's a amable weakness.' So I says respectin'
widders, Sammy, and so you'll say, ven you gets as old as me."

<P>"I ought to ha' know'd better, I know," said Sam.

<P>"Ought to ha' know'd better!" repeated Mr. Weller, striking the table
with his fist. "Ought to ha' know'd better! why, I know a young 'un as
hasn't had half nor quarter your eddication--as hasn't slept about the
markets, no, not six months--who'd ha' scorned to be let in, in such a
vay; scorned it, Sammy." In the excitement of feeling produced by this
agonising reflection, Mr. Weller rang the bell, and ordered an additional
pint of ale.

<P>"Well, it's no use talking about it now," said Sam. "It's over, and
can't be helped, and that's one consolation, as they always says in Turkey,
ven they cuts the wrong man's head off. It's my innings now, gov'rnor,
and as soon as I catches hold o' this ere Trotter, I'll have a good 'un."

<P>"I hope you will, Sammy. I hope you will," returned Mr. Weller. "Here's
your health, Sammy, and may you speedily vipe off the disgrace as you've
inflicted on the family name." In honour of this toast, Mr. Weller imbibed
at a draught, at least two-thirds of the newly-arrived pint, and handed
it over to his son, to dispose of the remainder, which he instantaneously
did.

<P>"And now, Sammy," said Mr. Weller, consulting the large double-faced
silver watch that hung at the end of the copper chain. "Now it's time I
was up at the office to get my vay-bill, and see the coach loaded; for
coaches, Sammy, is like guns--they require to be loaded with wery great
care, afore they go off."

<P>At this parental and professional joke, Mr. Weller junior smiled a filial
smile. His reversed parent continued in a solemn tone:

<P>"I'm a goin' to leave you, Samivel my boy, and there's no telling ven
I shall see you again. Your mother-in-law may ha' been too much for me,
or a thousand things may have happened by the time you next hears any news
o' the celebrated Mr. Veller o' the Bell Savage. The family name depends
wery much upon you, Samivel, and I hope you'll do wot's right by it. Upon
all little pints o' breedin', I know I may trust you as vell as if it was
my own self. So I've only this here one little bit of adwice to give you.
If ever you gets to up'ards o' fifty, and feels disposed to go a marryin'
anybody--no matter who--jist you shut yourself up in your own room, if
you've got one, and pison yourself off hand. Hangin's wulgar, so don't
you have nothin' to say to that. Pison yourself, Samivel, my boy, pison
yourself, and you'll be glad on it arterwards." With these affecting words,
Mr. Weller looked steadfastly on his son, and turning slowly upon his heel,
disappeared from his sight.

<P>In the contemplative mood which these words had awakened, Mr. Samuel
Weller walked forth from the Great White Horse when his father had left
him; and bending his steps towards St. Clement's Church, endeavoured to
dissipate his melancholy, by strolling among its ancient precincts. He
had loitered about, for some time, when he found himself in a retired spot--a
kind of court-yard of venerable appearance--which he discovered had no
other outlet than the turning by which he had entered. He was about retracing
his steps, when he was suddenly transfixed to the spot by a sudden appearance:
and the mode and manner of this appearance, we now proceed to relate.

<P>Mr. Samuel Weller had been staring up, at the old brick houses now and
then, in his deep abstraction, bestowing a wink upon some healthy-looking
servant girl as she drew up a blind, or threw open a bed-room window, when
the green gate of a garden at the bottom of the yard opened, and a man
having emerged therefrom, closed the green gate very carefully after him,
and walked briskly towards the very spot where Mr. Weller was standing.

<P>Now, taking this, as an isolated fact, unaccompanied by any attendant
circumstances, there was nothing very extraordinary in it; because in many
parts of the world, men do come out of gardens, close green gates after
them, and even walk briskly away, without attracting any particular share
of public observation. It is clear, therefore, that there must have been
something in the man, or in his manner, or both, to attract Mr. Weller's
particular notice. Whether there was, or not, we must leave the reader
to determine, when we have faithfully recorded the behaviour of the individual
in question.

<P>When the man had shut the green gate after him, he walked, as we have
said twice already, with a brisk pace up the court-yard; but he no sooner
caught sight of Mr. Weller, than he faltered, and stopped, as if uncertain,
for the moment, what course to adopt. As the green gate was closed behind
him, and there was no other outlet but the one in front, however, he was
not long in perceiving that he must pass Mr. Samuel Weller to get away.
He therefore resumed his brisk pace, and advanced, staring straight before
him. The most extraordinary thing about the man was, that he was contorting
his face into the most fearful and astonishing grimaces that ever were
beheld. Nature's handywork never was disguised with such extraordinary
artificial carving, as the man had overlaid his countenance with in one
moment.

<P>"Well!" said Mr. Weller to himself, as the man approached.

<P>"This is wery odd. I could ha' swore it was him."

<P>Up came the man, and his face became more frightfully distorted than
ever, as he drew nearer.

<P>"I could take my oath to that'ere black hair, and mulberry suit," said
Mr. Weller; "only I never see such a face as that, afore."

<P>As Mr. Weller said this, the man's features assumed an unearthly twinge,
perfectly hideous. He was obliged to pass very near Sam, however, and the
scrutinising glance of that gentleman enabled him to detect, under all
these appalling twists of feature, something too like the small eyes of
Mr. Job Trotter, to be easily mistaken.

<P>"Hallo, you sir!" shouted Sam, fiercely.

<P>The stranger stopped.

<P>"Hallo!" repeated Sam, still more gruffly.

<P>The man with the horrible face, looked, with the greatest surprise,
up the court, and down the court, and in at the windows of the houses--everywhere
but at Sam Weller--and took another step forward, when he was brought to
again, by another shout.

<P>"Hallo, you sir!" said Sam, for the third time.

<P>There was no pretending to mistake where the voice came from now, so
the stranger, having no other resource, at last looked Sam Weller full
in the face.

<P>"It won't do, Job Trotter," said Sam. "Come! None o' that 'ere nonsense.
You ain't so wery 'andsome that you can afford to throw avay many o' your
good looks. Bring them 'ere eyes o' your'n back into their proper places,
or I'll knock 'em out of your head. D'ye hear?"

<P>As Mr. Weller appeared fully disposed to act up to the spirit of this
address, Mr. Trotter gradually allowed his face to resume its natural expression;
and then giving a start of joy, exclaimed, "What do I see? Mr. Walker!"

<P>"Ah," replied Sam. "You're wery glad to see me, ain't you?"

<P>"Glad!" exclaimed Job Trotter; "oh, Mr. Walker, if you had but known
how I have looked forward to this meeting! It is too much, Mr. Walker;
I cannot bear it, indeed I cannot." And with these words, Mr. Trotter burst
into a regular inundation of tears, and, flinging his arms around those
of Mr. Weller, embraced him closely, in an ecstasy of joy.

<P>"Get off!" cried Sam, indignant at this process, and vainly endeavouring
to extricate himself from the grasp of his enthusiastic acquaintance. "Get
off, I tell you. What are you crying over me for, you portable ingine?"

<P>"Because I am so glad to see you," replied Job Trotter, gradually releasing
Mr. Weller, as the first symptoms of his pugnacity disappeared. "Oh, Mr.
Walker, this is too much."

<P>"Too much!" echoed Sam. "I think it is too much--rayther! Now what have
you got to say to me, eh?"

<P>Mr. Trotter made no reply; for the little pink pocket-handkerchief was
in full force.

<P>"What have you got to say to me, afore I knock your head off?" repeated
Mr. Weller, in a threatening manner.

<P>"Eh!" said Mr. Trotter, with a look of virtuous surprise.

<P>"What have you got to say to me?"

<P>"I, Mr. Walker!"

<P>"Don't call me Valker; my name's Veller; you know that vell enough.
What have you got to say to me?"

<P>"Bless you, Mr. Walker--Walker I mean--a great many things, if you will
come away somewhere, where we can talk comfortably. If you knew how I have
looked for you, Mr. Weller--"

<P>"Wery hard, indeed, I s'pose?" said Sam, drily.

<P>"Very, very, sir," replied Mr. Trotter, without moving a muscle of his
face. "But shake hands, Mr. Weller."

<P>Sam eyed his companion for a few seconds, and then, as if actuated by
a sudden impulse, complied with his request.

<P>"How," said Job Trotter, as they walked away, "How is your dear, good
master? Oh, he is a worthy gentleman, Mr. Weller! I hope he didn't catch
cold, that dreadful night, sir."

<P>There was a momentary look of deep slyness in Job Trotter's eye, as
he said this, which ran a thrill through Mr. Weller's clenched fist as
he burnt with a desire to make a demonstration on his ribs. Sam constrained
himself, however, and replied that his master was extremely well.

<P>"Oh, I am so glad," replied Mr. Trotter, "is he here?"

<P>"Is your'n?" asked Sam, by way of reply.

<P>"Oh, yes, he is here, and I grieve to say, Mr. Weller, he is going on,
worse than ever."

<P>"Ah, ah?" said Sam.

<P>"Oh, shocking--terrible!"

<P>"At a boarding-school?" said Sam.

<P>"No, not at a boarding-school," replied Job Trotter, with the same sly
look which Sam had noticed before; "Not at a boarding-school."

<P>"At the house with the green gate?" said Sam, eyeing his companion closely.

<P>"No, no--oh, not there," replied Job, with a quickness very unusual
to him, "not there."

<P>"What was <I>you</I> a dom' there?" asked Sam, with a sharp glance.
"Got inside the gate by accident, perhaps?"

<P>"Why, Mr. Weller," replied Job, "I don't mind telling you my little
secrets, because, you know, we took such a fancy for each other when we
first met. You recollect how pleasant we were that morning?"

<P>"Oh yes," said Sam, impatiently. "I remember. Well."

<P>"Well," replied Job, speaking with great precision, and in the low tone
of a man who communicates an important secret; "in that house with the
green gate, Mr. Weller, they keep a good many servants."

<P>"So I should think, from the look on it," interposed Sam.

<P>"Yes," continued Mr. Trotter, "and one of them is a cook, who has saved
up a little money, Mr. Weller, and is desirous, if she can establish herself
in life, to open a little shop in the chandlery way, you see."

<P>"Yes."

<P>"Yes, Mr. Weller. Well, sir, I met her at a chapel that I go to; a very
neat little chapel in this town, Mr. Weller, where they sing the number
four collection of hymns, which I generally carry about with me, in a little
book, which you may perhaps have seen in my hand--and I got a little intimate
with her, Mr. Weller, and from that, an acquaintance sprung up between
us, and I may venture to say, Mr. Weller, that I am to be the chandler."

<P>"Ah, and a wery amiable chandler you'll make," replied Sam, eyeing Job
with a side look of intense dislike.

<P>"The great advantage of this, Mr. Weller," continued Job, his eyes filling
with tears as he spoke, "will be, that I shall be able to leave my present
disgraceful service with that bad man, and to devote myself to a better
and more virtuous life; more like the way in which I was brought up, Mr.
Weller.

<P>"You must ha' been wery nicely brought up," said Sam.

<P>"Oh, very, Mr. Weller, very," replied Job. At the recollection of the
purity of his youthful days, Mr. Trotter pulled forth the pink handkerchief,
and wept copiously.

<P>"You must ha' been an uncommon nice boy, to go to school vith," said
Sam.

<P>"I was, sir," replied Job, heaving a deep sigh. "I was the idol of the
place."

<P>"Ah," said Sam, "I don't wonder at it. What a comfort you must ha' been
to your blessed mother."

<P>At these words, Mr. Job Trotter inserted an end of the pink handkerchief
into the corner of each eye, one after the other, and began to weep copiously.

<P>"Wot's the matter vith the man," said Sam, indignantly.

<P>"Chelsea water-works is nothin' to you. What are you melting vith now?
The consciousness o' willainy?"

<P>"I cannot keep my feelings down, Mr. Weller," said Job, after a short
pause. "To think that my master should have suspected the conversation
I had with yours, and so dragged me away in a post-chaise, and after persuading
the sweet young lady to say she knew nothing of him, and bribing the school-mistress
to do the same, deserted her for a better speculation! Oh! Mr. Weller,
it makes me shudder."

<P>"Oh, that was the vay, was it?" said Mr. Weller.

<P>"To be sure it was," replied Job.

<P>"Vell," said Sam, as they had now arrived near the Hotel, "I vant to
have a little bit o' talk with you, Job; so if you're not partickler engaged,
I should like to see you at the Great White Horse to-night, somewheres
about eight o'clock."

<P>"I shall be sure to come," said Job.

<P>"Yes, you'd better," replied Sam, with a very meaning look, "or else
I shall perhaps be asking arter you, at the other side of the green gate,
and then I might cut you out, you know."

<P>"I shall be sure to be with you, sir," said Mr. Trotter; and wringing
Sam's hand with the utmost fervour, he walked away.

<P>"Take care, Job Trotter, take care," said Sam, looking after him, "or
I shall be one too many for you this time. I shall, indeed." Having uttered
this soliloquy, and looked after Job till he was to be seen no more, Mr.
Weller made the best of his way to his master's bed-room.

<P>"It's all in training, sir," said Sam.

<P>"What's in training, Sam?" inquired Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"I have found 'em out, sir," said Sam.

<P>"Found out who?"

<P>"That 'ere queer customer, and the melan-cholly chap with the black
hair."

<P>"Impossible, Sam!" said Mr. Pickwick, with the greatest energy. "Where
are they, Sam; where are they?"

<P>"Hush, hush!" replied Mr. Weller; and as he assisted Mr. Pickwick to
dress, he detailed the plan of action on which he proposed to enter.

<P>"But when is this to be done, Sam?" inquired Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"All in good time, sir," replied Sam.

<P>Whether it was done in good time, or not, will be seen hereafter.
