<P>T<FONT SIZE=-1>HE</FONT> supper was ready laid, the chairs were drawn
round the table, bottles, jugs, and glasses were arranged upon the side-board,
and everything betokened the approach of the most convivial period in the
whole four-and-twenty hours.

<P>"Where's Rachael?" said Mr. Wardle.

<P>"Ay, and Jingle?" added Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"Dear me," said the host, "I wonder I haven't missed him before. Why,
I don't think I've heard his voice for two hours at least. Emily, my dear,
ring the bell."

<P>The bell was rung, and the fat boy appeared.

<P>"Where's Miss Rachael?" He couldn't say.

<P>"Where's Mr. Jingle, then?" He didn't know.

<P>Everybody looked surprised. It was late--past eleven o'clock. Mr. Tupman
laughed in his sleeve. They were loitering somewhere, talking about <I>him</I>.
Ha, ha! capital notion that--funny.

<P>"Never mind," said Wardle, after a short pause, "they'll turn up presently,
I dare say. I never wait supper for anybody."

<P>"Excellent rule, that," said Mr. Pickwick, "admirable."

<P>"Pray, sit down," said the host.

<P>"Certainly," said Mr. Pickwick: and down they sat.

<P>There was a gigantic round of cold beef on the table, and Mr. Pickwick
was supplied with a plentiful portion of it. He had raised his fork to
his lips, and was on the very point of opening his mouth for the reception
of a piece of beef, when the hum of many voices suddenly arose in the kitchen.
He paused, and laid down his fork. Mr. Wardle paused too, and insensibly
released his hold of the carving-knife, which remained inserted in the
beef. He looked at Mr. Pickwick, Mr. Pickwick looked at him.

<P>Heavy footsteps were heard in the passage; the parlour door was suddenly
burst open; and the man who had cleaned Mr. Pickwick's boots on his first
arrival, rushed into the room, followed by the fat boy, and all the domestics.

<P>"What the devil's the meaning of this?" exclaimed the host.

<P>"The kitchen chimney ain't a-fire, is it, Emma?" inquired the old lady.

<P>"Lor', grandma! No," screamed both the young ladies.

<P>"What's the matter?" roared the master of the house.

<P>The man gasped for breath, and faintly ejaculated--

<P>"They ha' gone, Mas'r!--gone right clean off, sir!" (At this juncture
Mr. Tupman was observed to lay down his knife and fork, and to turn very
pale.)

<P>"Who's gone?" said Mr. Wardle, fiercely.

<P>"Mus'r Jingle and Miss Rachael, in a po'-chay, from Blue Lion, Muggleton.
I was there; but I couldn't stop 'em; so I run off to tell'ee."

<P>"I paid his expenses!" said Mr. Tupman, jumping up frantically. "He's
got ten pounds of mine!--stop him!-- he's swindled me!--I won't bear it!--I'll
have justice, Pickwick!--I won't stand it!" and with sundry incoherent
exclamations of the like nature, the unhappy gentleman spun round and round
the apartment, in a transport of frenzy.

<P>"Lord preserve us!" ejaculated Mr. Pickwick, eyeing the extraordinary
gestures of his friend with terrified surprise. "He's gone mad! What shall
we do!"

<P>"Do!" said the stout old host, who regarded only the last words of the
sentence. "Put the horse in the gig! I'll get a chaise at the Lion, and
follow 'em instantly. Where"--he exclaimed, as the man ran out to execute
the commission--Where's that villain, Joe?"

<P>"Here I am; but I han't a willin," replied a voice. It was the fat boy's.

<P>"Let me get at him, Pickwick," cried Wardle, as he rushed at the ill-starred
youth. "He was bribed by that scoundrel, Jingle, to put me on a wrong scent,
by telling a cock-and-a-bull story of my sister and your friend Tupman!"
(Here Mr. Tupman sunk into a chair.) "Let me get at him!"

<P>"Don't let him!" screamed all the women, above whose exclamations the
blubbering of the fat boy was distinctly audible.

<P>"I won't be held!" cried the old man. "Mr. Winkle, take your hands off.
Mr. Pickwick, let me go, sir!"

<P>It was a beautiful sight, in that moment of turmoil and confusion, to
behold the placid and philosophical expression of Mr. Pickwick's face,
albeit somewhat flushed with exertion, as he stood with his arms firmly
clasped round the extensive waist of their corpulent host, thus restraining
the impetuosity of his passion, while the fat boy was scratched, and pulled,
and pushed from the room by all the females congregated therein. He had
no sooner released his hold, than the man entered to announce that the
gig was ready.

<P>"Don't let him go alone!" screamed the females. "He'll kill somebody!"

<P>"I'll go with him," said Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"You're a good fellow, Pickwick," said the host, grasping his hand.
"Emma, give Mr. Pickwick a shawl to tie round his neck--make haste. Look
after your grandmother, girls; she has fainted away. Now then, are you
ready?"

<P>Mr. Pickwick's mouth and chin having been hastily enveloped in a large
shawl: his hat having been put on his head, and his great coat thrown over
his arm, he replied in the affirmative.

<P>They jumped into the gig. "Give her her head, Tom," cried the host;
and away they went, down the narrow lanes: jolting in and out of the cart-ruts,
and bumping up against the hedges on either side, as if they would go to
pieces every moment.

<P>"How much are they a-head?" shouted Wardle, as they drove up to the
door of the Blue Lion, round which a little crowd had collected, late as
it was.

<P>"Not above three-quarters of an hour," was everybody's reply.

<P>"Chaise and four directly!--out with 'em! Put up the gig afterwards."

<P>"Now, boys!" cried the landlord--"chaise and four out--make haste--look
alive there!"

<P>Away ran the hostlers, and the boys. The lanterns glimmered, as the
men ran to and fro; the horses' hoofs clattered on the uneven paving of
the yard; the chaise rumbled as it was drawn out of the coach-house; and
all was noise and bustle.

<P>"Now then!--is that chaise coming out to-night?" cried Wardle.

<P>"Coming down the yard now, sir," replied the hostler.

<P>Out came the chaise--in went the horses--on sprung the boys--in got
the travellers.

<P>"Mind--the seven-mile stage in less than half an hour!" shouted Wardle.

<P>"Off with you!"

<P>The boys applied whip and spur, the waiters shouted, the hostlers cheered,
and away they went, fast and furiously.

<P>"Pretty situation," thought Mr. Pickwick, when he had had a moment's
time for reflection. "Pretty situation for the General Chairman of the
Pickwick Club. Damp chaise--strange horses--fifteen miles an hour--and
twelve o'clock at night!"

<P>For the first three or four miles, not a word was spoken by either of
the gentlemen, each being too much immersed in his own reflections to address
any observations to his companion. When they had gone over that much ground,
however, and the horses getting thoroughly warmed began to do their work
in really good style, Mr. Pickwick became too much exhilarated with the
rapidity of the motion, to remain any longer perfectly mute.

<P>"We're sure to catch them, I think," said he.

<P>"Hope so," replied his companion.

<P>"Fine night," said Mr. Pickwick, looking up at the moon, which was shining
brightly.

<P>"So much the worse," returned Wardle; "for they'll have had all the
advantage of the moonlight to get the start of us, and we shall lose it.
It will have gone down in another hour."

<P>"It will be rather unpleasant going at this rate in the dark, won't
it?" inquired Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"I daresay it will," replied his friend drily.

<P>Mr. Pickwick's temporary excitement began to sober down a little, as
he reflected upon the inconveniences and dangers of the expedition in which
he had so thoughtlessly embarked. He was roused by a loud shouting of the
post-boy on the leader.

<P>"Yo--yo--yo--yo--yoe," went the first boy.

<P>"Yo--yo--yo--yoe!" went the second.

<P>"Yo--yo--yo--yoe!" chimed in old Wardle himself, most lustily, with
his head and half his body out of the coach window.

<P>"Yo--yo--yo--yoe!" shouted Mr. Pickwick, taking up the burden of the
cry, though he had not the slightest notion of its meaning or object. And
amidst the yo--yoing of the whole four, the chaise stopped.

<P>"What's the matter?" inquired Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"There's a gate here," replied old Wardle. "We shall hear something
of the fugitives."

<P>After a lapse of five minutes, consumed in incessant knocking and shouting,
an old man in his shirt and trousers emerged from the turnpike-house, and
opened the gate.

<P>"How long is it since a post-chaise went through here?" inquired Mr.
Wardle.

<P>"How long?"

<P>"Ah!"

<P>"Why, I don't rightly know. It worn't a long time ago, nor it worn't
a short time ago--just between the two, perhaps."

<P>"Has any chaise been by at all?"

<P>"Oh yes, there's been a shay by."

<P>"How long ago, my friend," interposed Mr. Pickwick, "an hour?"

<P>"Ah, I daresay it might be," replied the man.

<P>"Or two hours?" inquired the post-boy on the wheeler.

<P>"Well, I shouldn't wonder if it was," returned the old man doubtfully.

<P>"Drive on, boys," cried the testy old gentleman; "don't waste any more
time with that old idiot!"

<P>"Idiot!" exclaimed the old man with a grin, as he stood in the middle
of the road with the gate half-closed, watching the chaise which rapidly
diminished in the increasing distance. "No--not much o' that either; you've
lost ten minutes here, and gone away as wise as you came, arter all. If
every man on the line as has a guinea give him, earns it half as well,
you won't catch t'other shay this side Mich'lmas, old short-and-fat." And
with another prolonged grin, the old man closed the gate, re-entered his
house, and bolted the door after him.

<P>Meanwhile the chaise proceeded, without any slackening of pace, towards
the conclusion of the stage. The moon, as Wardle had foretold, was rapidly
on the wane; large tiers of dark heavy clouds, which had been gradually
overspreading the sky for some time past, now formed one black mass overhead;
and large drops of rain which pattered every now and then against the windows
of the chaise, seemed to warn the travellers of the rapid approach of a
stormy night. The wind, too, which was directly against them, swept in
furious gusts down the narrow road, and howled dismally through the trees
which skirted the pathway. Mr. Pickwick drew his coat closer about him,
coiled himself more snugly up into the corner of the chaise, and fell into
a sound sleep, from which he was only awakened by the stopping of the vehicle,
the sound of the hostler's bell, and a loud cry of "Horses on directly!"

<P>But here another delay occurred. The boys were sleeping with such mysterious
soundness, that it took five minutes a-piece to wake them. The hostler
had somehow or other mislaid the key of the stable, and even when that
was found, two sleepy helpers put the wrong harness on the wrong horses,
and the whole process of harnessing had to be gone through afresh. Had
Mr. Pickwick been alone, these multiplied obstacles would have completely
put an end to the pursuit at once, but old Wardle was not to be so easily
daunted; and he laid about him with such hearty good-will, cuffing this
man, and pushing that; strapping a buckle here, and taking in a link there,
that the chaise was ready in a much shorter time than could reasonably
have been expected, under so many difficulties.

<P>They resumed their journey; and certainly the prospect before them was
by no means encouraging. The stage was fifteen miles long, the night was
dark, the wind high, and the rain pouring in torrents. It was impossible
to make any great way against such obstacles united: it was hard upon one
o'clock already; and nearly two hours were consumed in getting to the end
of the stage. Here, however, an object presented itself, which rekindled
their hopes, and re-animated their dropping spirits.

<P>"When did this chaise come in?" cried old Wardle, leaping out of his
own vehicle, and pointing to one covered with wet mud, which was standing
in the yard.

<P>"Not a quarter of an hour ago, sir;" replied the hostler, to whom the
question was addressed.

<P>"Lady and gentleman?" inquired Wardle, almost breathless with impatience.

<P>"Yes, sir."

<P>"Tall gentleman--dress coat--long legs--thin body?"

<P>"Yes, sir."

<P>"Elderly lady--thin face--rather skinny--eh?"

<P>"Yes, sir."

<P>"By heavens, it's the couple, Pickwick," exclaimed the old gentleman.

<P>"Would have been here before," said the hostler, "but they broke a trace."

<P>"It is!" said Wardle, "it is by Jove! Chaise and four instantly! We
shall catch them yet, before they reach the next stage. A guinea a-piece,
boys--be alive there--bustle about--there's good fellows."

<P>And with such admonitions as these, the old gentleman ran up and down
the yard, and bustled to and fro, in a state of excitement which communicated
itself to Mr. Pickwick also; and under the influence of which, that gentleman
got himself into complicated entanglements with harness, and mixed up with
horses and wheels of chaises, in the most surprising manner, firmly believing
that by so doing he was materially forwarding the preparations for their
resuming their journey.

<P>"Jump in--jump in!" cried old Wardle, climbing into the chaise, pulling
up the steps, and slamming the door after him. "Come along! Make haste!"
And before Mr. Pickwick knew precisely what he was about, he felt himself
forced in at the other door, by one pull from the old gentleman, and one
push from the hostler; and off they were again.

<P>"Ah! we <I>are</I> moving now," said the old gentleman exultingly. They
were indeed, as was sufficiently testified to Mr. Pickwick, by his constant
collisions either with the hard wood-work of the chaise, or the body of
his companion.

<P>"Hold up!" said the stout old Mr. Wardle, as Mr. Pickwick dived head
foremost into his capacious waistcoat.

<P>"I never did feel such a jolting in my life," said Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"Never mind," replied his companion, "it will soon be over. Steady,
steady."

<P>Mr. Pickwick planted himself into his own corner, as firmly as he could;
and on whirled the chaise faster than ever.

<P>They had travelled in this way about three miles, when Mr. Wardle, who
had been looking out of the window, for two or three minutes, suddenly
drew in his face, covered with splashes, and exclaimed in breathless eagerness--

<P>"Here they are!"

<P>Mr. Pickwick thrust his head out of his window. Yes: there was a chaise
and four, a short distance before them, dashing along at full gallop.

<P>"Go on, go on," almost shrieked the old gentleman. "Two guineas a-piece,
boys--don't let 'em gain on us--keep it up--keep it up."

<P>The horses in the first chaise started on at their utmost speed; and
those in Mr. Wardle's galloped furiously behind them.

<P>"I see his head," exclaimed the choleric old man. "Damme, I see his
head."

<P>"So do I," said Mr. Pickwick, "that's he."

<P>Mr. Pickwick was not mistaken. The countenance of Mr. Jingle, completely
coated with the mud thrown up by the wheels, was plainly discernible at
the window of his chaise; and the motion of his arm, which he was waving
violently towards the postillions, denoted that he was encouraging them
to increased exertion.

<P>The interest was intense. Fields, trees, and hedges, seemed to rush
past them with the velocity of a whirlwind, so rapid was the pace at which
they tore along. They were close by the side of the first chaise. Jingle's
voice could be plainly heard, even above the din of the wheels, urging
on the boys. Old Mr. Wardle foamed with rage and excitement. He roared
out scoundrels and villains by the dozen, clenched his first and shook
it expressively at the object of his indignation; but Mr. Jingle only answered
with a contemptuous smile, and replied to his menaces by a shout of triumph,
as his horses, answering the increased application of whip and spur, broke
into a faster gallop, and left the pursuers behind.

<P>Mr. Pickwick had just drawn in his head, and Mr. Wardle, exhausted with
shouting, had done the same, when a tremendous jolt threw them forward
against the front of the vehicle. There was a sudden bump--a loud crash--away
rolled a wheel, and over went the chaise.

<P>After a very few seconds of bewilderment and confusion, in which nothing
but the plunging of horses and breaking of glass could be made out, Mr.
Pickwick felt himself violently pulled out from among the ruins of the
chaise; and as soon as he had gained his feet, and extricated his head
from the skirts of his great coat, which materially impeded the usefulness
of his spectacles, the full disaster of the case met his view.

<P>Old Mr. Wardle without a hat, and his clothes torn in several places,
stood by his side, and the fragments of the chaise lay scattered at their
feet. The post-boys, who had succeeded in cutting the traces, were standing,
disfigured with mud and disordered by hard riding, by the horses' heads.
About a hundred yards in advance was the other chaise, which had pulled
up on hearing the crash. The postillions, each with a broad grin convulsing
his countenance, were viewing the adverse party from their saddles, and
Mr. Jingle was contemplating the wreck from the coach-window, with evident
satisfaction. The day was just breaking, and the whole scene was rendered
perfectly visible by the grey light of the morning.

<P>"Hallow!" shouted the shameless Jingle, "anybody damaged?--elderly gentlemen--no
light weights--dangerous work--very.

<P>"You're a rascal!" roared Wardle.

<P>"Ha! ha!" replied Jingle; and then he added, with a knowing wink, and
a jerk of the thumb towards the interior of the chaise--"I say--she's very
well--desires her compliments--begs you won't trouble yourself--love to
<I>Tuppy</I>--won't you get up behind?--drive on, boys."

<P>The postillions resumed their proper attitudes, and away rattled the
chaise, Mr. Jingle fluttering in derision a white handkerchief from the
coach-window.

<P>Nothing in the whole adventure, not even the upset, had disturbed the
calm and equable current of Mr. Pickwick's temper. The villainy, however,
which could first borrow money of his faithful follower, and then abbreviate
his name to "Tuppy" was more than he could patiently bear. He drew his
breath hard, and coloured up to the very tips of his spectacles, as he
said, slowly and emphatically--

<P>"If ever I meet that man again, I'll--"

<P>"Yes, yes," interrupted Wardle, "that's all very well: but while we
stand talking here, they'll get their licence, and be married in London.

<P>Mr. Pickwick paused, bottled up his vengeance, and corked it down.

<P>"How far is it to the next stage?" inquired Mr. Wardle, of one of the
boys.

<P>"Six mile, ain't it, Tom?"

<P>"Rayther better."

<P>"Rayther better nor six mile, sir."

<P>"Can't be helped," said Wardle, "we must walk it, Pickwick."

<P>"No help for it," replied that truly great man.

<P>So sending forward one of the boys on horseback, to procure a fresh
chaise and horses, and leaving the other behind to take care of the broken
one, Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Wardle set manfully forward on the walk, first
tying their shawls round their necks, and slouching down their hats to
escape as much as possible from the deluge of rain, which after a slight
cessation had again begun to pour heavily down.
