<CENTER><FONT SIZE=-1>CONTAINING SOME PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO THE DOUBLE
KNOCK, AND OTHER MATTERS: AMONG WHICH CERTAIN INTERESTING DISCLOSURES RELATIVE
TO MR. SNODGRASS AND A YOUNG LADY ARE BY NO MEANS IRRELEVANT TO THIS HISTORY</FONT></CENTER>


<P>T<FONT SIZE=-1>HE</FONT> object that presented itself to the eyes of
the astonished clerk, was a boy -- a wonderfully fat boy -- habited as
a serving lad, standing upright on the mat, with his eyes closed as if
in sleep. He had never seen such a fat boy, in or out of a travelling caravan;
and this, coupled with the calmness and repose of his appearance, so very
different from what was reasonably to have been expected of the inflicter
of such knocks, smote him with wonder.

<P>"What's the matter?" inquired the clerk.

<P>The extraordinary boy replied not a word; but he nodded once, and seemed,
to the clerk's imagination, to snore feebly.

<P>"Where do you come from?" inquired the clerk.

<P>The boy made no sign. He breathed heavily, but in all other respects
was motionless.

<P>The clerk repeated the question thrice, and receiving no answer, prepared
to shut the door, when the boy suddenly opened his eyes, winked several
times, sneezed once, and raised his hand as if to repeat the knocking.
Finding the door open, he stared about him with astonishment, and at length
fixed his eyes on Mr. Lowten's face.

<P>"What the devil do you knock in that way for?" inquired the clerk, angrily.

<P>"Which way?" said the boy, in a slow and sleepy voice.

<P>"Why, like forty hackney-coachmen," replied the clerk.

<P>"Because master said, I wasn't to leave off knocking till they opened
the door, for fear I should go to sleep," said the boy.

<P>"Well," said the clerk, "what message have you brought?"

<P>"He's down-stairs," rejoined the boy.

<P>"Who?"

<P>"Master. He wants to know whether you're at home."

<P>Mr. Lowten bethought himself, at this juncture, of looking out of the
window. Seeing an open carriage with a hearty old gentleman in it, looking
up very anxiously, he ventured to beckon him; on which, the old gentleman
jumped out directly.

<P>"That's your master in the carriage, I suppose?" said Lowten.

<P>The boy nodded.

<P>All further inquiries were superseded by the appearance of old Wardle,
who, running up-stairs, and just recognising Lowten, passed at once into
Mr. Perker's room.

<P>"Pickwick!" said the old gentleman. "Your hand, my boy! Why have I never
heard until the day before yesterday of your suffering yourself to be cooped
up in jail? And why did you let him do it, Perker?"

<P>"I couldn't help it, my dear sir," replied Perker, with a smile and
a pinch of snuff: "you know how obstinate he is."

<P>"Of course I do, of course I do," replied the old gentleman. "I am heartily
glad to see him, notwithstanding. I will not lose sight of him again, in
a hurry."

<P>With these words, Wardle shook Mr. Pickwick's hand once more, and, having
done the same by Perker, threw himself into an arm-chair; his jolly red
face shining again with smiles and health.

<P>"Well!" said Wardle. "Here are pretty goings on -- a pinch of your snuff,
Perker, my boy -- never were such times, eh?"

<P>"What do you mean?" inquired Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"Mean!" replied Wardle. "Why, I think the girls are all running mad;
that's no news, you'll say? Perhaps it's not; but it's true, for all that."

<P>"You have not come up to London, of all places in the world, to tell
us <I>that</I>, my dear sir, have you?" inquired Perker.

<P>"No, not altogether," replied Wardle; "though it was the main cause
of my coming. How's Arabella?"

<P>"Very well," replied Mr. Pickwick, "and will be delighted to see you,
I am sure."

<P>"Black-eyed little jilt!" replied Wardle, "I had a great idea of marrying
her myself, one of these odd days. But I am glad of it too, very glad."

<P>"How did the intelligence reach you?" asked Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"Oh, it came to my girls, of course," replied Wardle. "Arabella wrote,
the day before yesterday, to say she had made a stolen match without her
husband's father's consent, and so you had gone down to get it when his
refusing it couldn't prevent the match, and all the rest of it. I thought
it a very good time to say something serious to <I>my</I> girls; so I said
what a dreadful thing it was that children should marry without their parent's
consent, and so forth; but, bless your hearts, I couldn't make the least
impression upon them. They thought it such a much more dreadful thing that
there should have been a wedding without bridesmaids, that I might as well
have preached to Joe himself."

<P>Here the old gentleman stopped to laugh; and having done so to his heart's
content, presently resumed.

<P>"But this is not the best of it, it seems. This is only half the love-making
and plotting that have been going forward. We have been walking on mines
for the last six months, and they're sprung at last."

<P>"What do you mean!" exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, turning pale; "no other
secret marriage, I hope?"

<P>"No, no," replied old Wardle; "not so bad as that; no."

<P>"What then?" inquired Mr. Pickwick; "am I interested in it?"

<P>"Shall I answer that question, Perker?" said Wardle.

<P>"If you don't commit yourself by doing so, my dear sir."

<P>"Well then, you are," said Wardle.

<P>"How?" asked Mr. Pickwick anxiously. "In what way?"

<P>"Really," replied Wardle, "you're such a fiery sort of young fellow
that I am almost afraid to tell you; but, however, if Perker will sit between
us to prevent mischief, I'll venture."

<P>Having closed the room door, and fortified himself with another application
to Perker's snuff-box, the old gentleman proceeded with his great disclosure
in these words.

<P>"The fact is, that my daughter Bella -- Bella, who married young Trundle,
you know."

<P>"Yes, yes, we know," said Mr. Pickwick impatiently.

<P>"Don't alarm me at the very beginning. My daughter Bella, Emily having
gone to bed with a headache after she had read Arabella's letter to me,
sat herself down by my side the other evening, and began to talk over this
marriage affair. `Well, pa,' she says, `what do you think of it?' `Why,
my dear,' I said, `I suppose it's all very well; I hope it's for the best.'
I answered in this way because I was sitting before the fire at the time,
drinking my grog rather thoughtfully, and I knew my throwing in an undecided
word now and then, would induce her to continue talking. Both my girls
are pictures of their dear mother, and as I grow old I like to sit with
only them by me; for their voices and looks carry me back to the happiest
period of my life, and make me, for the moment, as young as I used to be
then, though not quite so light-hearted. `It's quite a marriage of affection,
pa,' said Bella, after a short silence. `Yes, my dear, said I, `but such
marriages do not always turn out the happiest.'"

<P>"I question that, mind!" interposed Mr. Pickwick, warmly.

<P>"Very good," responded Wardle, "question anything you like when it's
your turn to speak, but don't interrupt me."

<P>"I beg your pardon," said Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"Granted," replied Wardle. "`I am sorry to hear you express your opinion
against marriages of affection, pa,' said Bella, colouring a little. `I
was wrong; I ought not to have said so, my dear, either,' said I, patting
her cheek as kindly as a rough old fellow like me could pat it, `for your
mother's was one, and so was yours.' `It's not that, I meant, pa,' said
Bella. `The fact is, pa, I wanted to speak to you about Emily.'"

<P>Mr. Pickwick started.

<P>"What's the matter now?" inquired Wardle, stopping in his narrative.

<P>"Nothing," replied Mr. Pickwick. "Pray go on."

<P>"I never could spin out a story," said Wardle abruptly. "It must come
out, sooner or later, and it'll save us all a great deal of time if it
comes at once. The long and the short of it is, then, that Bella at last
mustered up courage to tell me that Emily was very unhappy; that she and
your young friend Snodgrass had been in constant correspondence and communication
ever since last Christmas; that she had very dutifully made up her mind
to run away with him, in laudable imitation of her old friend and schoolfellow;
but that having some compunctions of conscience on the subject, inasmuch
as I had always been rather kindly disposed to both of them, they had thought
it better in the first instance to pay me the compliment of asking whether
I would have any objection to their being married in the usual matter-of-fact
manner. There now, Mr. Pickwick, if you can make it convenient to reduce
your eyes to their usual size again, and to let me hear what you think
we ought to do, I shall feel rather obliged to you!"

<P>The testy manner in which the hearty old gentleman uttered this last
sentence was not wholly unwarranted; for Mr. Pickwick's face had settled
down into an expression of blank amazement and perplexity, quite curious
to behold.

<P>"Snodgrass! Since last Christmas!" were the first broken words that
issued from the lips of the confounded gentleman.

<P>"Since last Christmas," replied Wardle; "that's plain enough, and very
bad spectacles we must have worn, not to have discovered it before."

<P>"I don't understand it," said Mr. Pickwick, ruminating; "I really cannot
understand it."

<P>"It's easy enough to understand," replied the choleric old gentleman.
"If you had been a younger man, you would have been in the secret long
ago; and besides," added Wardle after a moment's hesitation, "the truth
is, that, knowing nothing of this matter, I have rather pressed Emily for
four or five months past, to receive favourably (if she could; I would
never attempt to force a girl's inclinations) the addresses of a young
gentleman down in our neighbourhood. I have no doubt that, girl-like, to
enhance her own value and increase the ardour of Mr. Snodgrass, she has
represented this matter in very glowing colours, and that they have both
arrived at the conclusion that they are a terribly persecuted pair of unfortunates,
and have no resource but clandestine matrimony or charcoal. Now the question
is, what's to be done?"

<P>"What have <I>you</I> done?" inquired Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"I!"

<P>"I mean what did you do when your married daughter told you this?"

<P>"Oh, I made a fool of myself, of course," rejoined Wardle.

<P>"Just so," interposed Perker, who had accompanied this dialogue with
sundry twitchings of his watch-chain, vindictive rubbings of his nose,
and other symptoms of impatience. "That's very natural; but how?"

<P>"I went into a great passion and frightened my mother into a fit," said
Wardle.

<P>"That was judicious," remarked Perker; "and what else?"

<P>"I fretted and fumed all next day, and raised a great disturbance,"
rejoined the old gentleman. "At last I got tired of rendering myself unpleasant
and making everybody miserable; so I hired a carriage at Muggleton, and,
putting my own horses in it, came up to town, under pretence of bringing
Emily to see Arabella."

<P>"Miss Wardle is with you, then?" said Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"To be sure she is," replied Wardle. "She is at Osborne's hotel in the
Adelphi at this moment, unless your enterprising friend has run away with
her since I came out this morning."

<P>"You are reconciled, then?" said Perker.

<P>"Not a bit of it," answered Wardle; "she has been crying and moping
ever since, except last night, between tea and supper, when she made a
great parade of writing a letter that I pretended to take no notice of."

<P>"You want my advice in this matter, I suppose?" said Perker, looking
from the musing face of Mr. Pickwick to the eager countenance of Wardle,
and taking several consecutive pinches of his favourite stimulant.

<P>"I suppose so," said Wardle, looking at Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"Certainly," replied that gentleman.

<P>"Well then," said Perker, rising and pushing his chair back, "my advice
is that you both walk away together, or ride away, or get away by some
means or other, for I'm tired of you, and just talk this matter over between
you. If you have not settled it by the next time I see you, I'll tell you
what to do."

<P>"This is satisfactory," said Wardle, hardly knowing whether to smile
or be offended.

<P>"Pooh, pooh, my dear sir," returned Perker. "I know you both a great
deal better than you know yourselves. You have settled it already, to all
intents and purposes."

<P>Thus expressing himself, the little gentleman poked his snuff-box, first
into the chest of Mr. Pickwick, and then into the waistcoat of Mr. Wardle,
upon which they all three laughed, but especially the two last-named gentlemen,
who at once shook hands again, without any obvious or particular reason.

<P>"You dine with me to-day," said Wardle to Perker, as he showed them
out.

<P>"Can't promise, my dear sir, can't promise," replied Perker. "I'll look
in, in the evening, at all events."

<P>"I shall expect you at five," said Wardle. "Now, Joe!" And Joe having
been at length awakened, the two friends departed in Mr. Wardle's carriage,
which in common humanity had a dickey behind for the fat boy, who, if there
had been a foot-board instead, would have rolled off and killed himself
in his very first nap.

<P>"Driving to the George and Vulture, they found that Arabella and her
maid had sent for a hackney-coach immediately on the receipt of a short
note from Emily announcing her arrival in town, and had proceeded straight
to the Adelphi. As Wardle had business to transact in the city, they sent
the carriage and the fat boy to his hotel, with the information that he
and Mr. Pickwick would return together to dinner at five o'clock.

<P>Charged with this message, the fat boy returned, slumbering as peaceably
in his dickey, over the stones, as if it had been a down bed on watch-springs.
By some extraordinary miracle he awoke of his own accord, when the coach
stopped, and giving himself a good shake to stir up his faculties, went
up-stairs to execute his commission.

<P>Now, whether the shake had jumbled the fat boy's faculties together,
instead of arranging them in proper order, or had roused such a quantity
of new ideas within him as to render him oblivious of ordinary forms and
ceremonies, or (which is also possible) had proved unsuccessful in preventing
his falling asleep as he ascended the stairs, it is an undoubted fact that
he walked into the sitting-room without previously knocking at the door;
and so beheld a gentleman with his arms clasping his young mistress's waist,
sitting very lovingly by her side on a sofa, while Arabella and her pretty
handmaid feigned to be absorbed in looking out of a window at the other
end of the room. At sight of this phenomenon, the fat boy uttered an interjection,
the ladies a scream, and the gentleman an oath, almost simultaneously.

<P>"Wretched creature, what do you want here?" said the gentleman, who
it is needless to say was Mr. Snodgrass.

<P>To this the fat boy, considerably terrified, briefly responded, "Missis."

<P>"What do you want me for?" inquired Emily, turning her head aside, "you
stupid creature!"

<P>"Master and Mr. Pickwick is a going to dine here at five," replied the
fat boy.

<P>"Leave the room!" said Mr. Snodgrass, glaring upon the bewildered youth.

<P>"No, no, no," added Emily hastily. "Bella, dear, advise me."

<P>Upon this, Emily and Mr. Snodgrass, and Arabella and Mary, crowded into
a corner, and conversed earnestly in whispers for some minutes, during
which the fat boy dozed.

<P>"Joe," said Arabella, at length, looking round with a most bewitching
smile, "how do you do, Joe?"

<P>"Joe," said Emily, "you're a very good boy; I won't forget you, Joe."

<P>"Joe," said Mr. Snodgrass, advancing to the astonished youth, and seizing
his hand, "I didn't know you before. There's five shillings for you, Joe!"

<P>"I'll owe you five, Joe," said Arabella, "for old acquaintance sake,
you know;" and another most captivating smile was bestowed upon the corpulent
intruder.

<P>The fat boy's perception being slow, he looked rather puzzled at first
to account for this sudden prepossession in his favour, and stared about
him in a very alarming manner. At length his broad face began to show symptoms
of a grin of pr'oportionately broad dimensions; and then, thrusting half-a-crown
into each of his pockets, and a hand and wrist after it, he burst into
a hoarse laugh: being for the first and only time in his existence.

<P>"He understands us, I see," said Arabella.

<P>"He had better have something to eat, immediately," remarked Emily.

<P>The fat boy almost laughed again when he heard this suggestion. Mary,
after a little more whispering, tripped forth from the group, and said:

<P>"I am going to dine with you to-day, sir, if you have no objection."

<P>"This way," said the fat boy, eagerly. "There is such a jolly meat pie!"

<P>With these words, the fat boy led the way down-stairs; his pretty companion
captivating all the waiters and angering all the chambermaids as she followed
him to the eating-room.

<P>There was the meat-pie of which the youth had spoken so feelingly, and
there were, moreover, a steak, and a dish of potatoes, and a pot of porter.

<P>"Sit down," said the fat boy. "Oh, my eye, how prime! I am <I>so</I>
hungry."

<P>Having apostrophised his eye, in a species of rapture, five or six times,
the youth took the head of the little table, and Mary seated herself at
the bottom.

<P>"Will you have some of this?" said the fat boy, plunging into the pie
up to the very ferules of the knife and fork.

<P>"A little, if you please," replied Mary.

<P>The fat boy assisted Mary to a little, and himself to a great deal,
and was just going to begin eating when he suddenly laid down his knife
and fork, leant forward in his chair, and letting his hands, with the knife
and fork in them, fall on his knees, said, very slowly:

<P>"I say! How nice you look!"

<P>This was said in an admiring manner, and was, so far, gratifying; but
still there was enough of the cannibal in the young gentleman's eyes to
render the compliment a double one.

<P>"Dear me, Joseph," said Mary, affecting to blush, "what do you mean?"

<P>The fat boy gradually recovering his former position, replied with a
heavy sigh, and remaining thoughtful for a few moments, drank a long draught
of the porter. Having achieved this feat he sighed again, and applied himself
assiduously to the pie.

<P>"What a nice young lady Miss Emily is!" said Mary, after a long silence.

<P>The fat boy had by this time finished the pie. He fixed his eyes on
Mary, and replied:

<P>"I knows a nicerer."

<P>"Indeed!" said Mary.

<P>"Yes, indeed!" replied the fat boy, with unwonted vivacity.

<P>"What's her name?" inquired Mary.

<P>"What's yours?"

<P>"Mary."

<P>"So's hers," said the fat boy. "You're her." The boy grinned to add
point to the compliment, and put his eyes into something between a squint
and a cast, which there is reason to believe he intended for an ogle.

<P>"You mustn't talk to me in that way," said Mary; "you don't mean it."

<P>"Don't I, though?" replied the fat boy; "I say!"

<P>"Well."

<P>"Are you going to come here regular?"

<P>"No," rejoined Mary, shaking her head, "I'm going away again to-night.
Why?"

<P>"Oh!" said the fat boy in a tone of strong feeling; "how we should have
enjoyed ourselves at meals, if you had been!"

<P>"I might come here sometimes, perhaps, to see you," said Mary, plaiting
the table-cloth in assumed coyness, "if you would do me a favour."

<P>The fat boy looked from the pie-dish to the steak, as if he thought
a favour must be in a manner connected with something to eat; and then
took out one of the half-crowns and glanced at it nervously.

<P>"Don't you understand me?" said Mary, looking slyly in his fat face.

<P>Again he looked at the half-crown, and said faintly, "No."

<P>"The ladies want you not to say anything to the old gentleman about
the young gentleman having been upstairs; and I want you too."

<P>"Is that all?" said the fat boy, evidently very much relieved as he
pocketed the half-crown again. "Of course I ain't a going to."

<P>"You see," said Mary, "Mr. Snodgrass is very fond of Miss Emily, and
Miss Emily's very fond of him, and if you were to tell about it, the old
gentleman would carry you all away miles into the country, where you'd
see nobody."

<P>"No, no, I won't tell," said the fat boy, stoutly.

<P>"That's a dear," said Mary. "Now it's time I went upstairs, and got
my lady ready for dinner."

<P>"Don't go yet," urged the fat boy.

<P>"I must," replied Mary. "Good bye, for the present."

<P>The fat boy, with elephantine playfulness, stretched out his arms to
ravish a kiss; but as it required no great agility to elude him, his fair
enslaver had vanished before he closed them again; upon which the apathetic
youth ate a pound or so of steak with a sentimental countenance, and fell
fast asleep.

<P>There was so much to say up-stairs, and there were so many plans to
concert for elopement and matrimony in the event of old Wardle continuing
to be cruel, that it wanted only half an hour of dinner when Mr. Snodgrass
took his final adieu. The ladies ran to Emily's bedroom to dress, and the
lover taking up his hat, walked out of the room. He had scarcely got outside
the door, when he heard Wardle's voice talking loudly, and looking over
the banisters, beheld him, followed by some other gentleman, coming straight
upstairs. Knowing nothing of the house, Mr. Snodgrass in his confusion
stepped hastily back into the room he had just quitted, and passing from
thence into an inner apartment (Mr. Wardle's bed-chamber), closed the door
softly, just as the persons he had caught a glimpse of, entered the sitting-room.
These were Mr. Wardle, Mr. Pickwick, Mr. Nathaniel Winkle, and Mr. Benjamin
Allen, whom he had no difficulty in recognising by their voices.

<P>"Very lucky I had the presence of mind to avoid them," thought Mr. Snodgrass
with a smile, and walking on tiptoe to another door near the bedside; "this
opens into the same passage, and I can walk, quietly and comfortably, away."

<P>There was only one obstacle to his walking quietly and comfortably away,
which was that the door was locked and the key gone.

<P>"Let us have some of your best wine to-day, waiter," said old Wardle,
rubbing his hands.

<P>"You shall have some of the very best, sir," replied the waiter.

<P>"Let the ladies know we have come in."

<P>"Yes, sir."

<P>Devoutly and ardently did Mr. Snodgrass wish that the ladies could know
<I>he</I> had come in. He ventured once to whisper "Waiter!" through the
keyhole, but as the probability of the wrong waiter coming to his relief,
flashed upon his mind, together with a sense of the strong resemblance
between his own situation and that in which another gentleman had been
recently found in a neighbouring hotel (an account of whose misfortunes
had appeared under the head of "Police" in that morning's paper), he sat
himself on a portmanteau, and trembled violently.

<P>"We won't wait a minute for Perker," said Wardle, looking at his watch;
"he is always exact. He will be here, in time, if he means to come; and
if he does not, it's of no use waiting. Ha! Arabella!"

<P>"My sister!" exclaimed Mr. Benjamin Allen, folding her in a most romantic
embrace.

<P>"Oh, Ben, dear, how you do smell of tobacco," said Arabella, rather
overcome by this mark of affection.

<P>"Do I?" said Mr. Benjamin Allen, "Do I, Bella? Well, perhaps I do."

<P>Perhaps he did; having just left a pleasant little smoking party of
twelve medical students, in a small back parlour with a large fire.

<P>"But I am delighted to see you," said Mr. Ben Allen, "Bless you, Bella!"

<P>"There," said Arabella, bending forward to kiss her brother; "don't
take hold of me again, Ben dear, because you tumble me so."

<P>At this point of the reconciliation, Mr. Ben Allen allowed his feelings
and the cigars and porter to overcome him, and looked round upon the beholders
with damp spectacles.

<P>"Is nothing to be said to me?" cried Wardle with open arms.

<P>"A great deal," whispered Arabella, as she received the old gentleman's
hearty caress and congratulation. "You are a hard-hearted, unfeeling, cruel
monster!"

<P>"You are a little rebel," replied Wardle, in the same tone, "and I am
afraid I shall be obliged to forbid you the house. People like you, who
get married in spite of everybody, ought not to be let loose on society.
But come!" added the old gentleman aloud, "Here's the dinner; you shall
sit by me. Joe; why, damn the boy, he's awake!"

<P>To the great distress of his master, the fat boy was indeed in a state
of remarkable vigilance; his eyes being wide open, and looking as if they
intended to remain so. There was an alacrity in his manner, too, which
was equally unaccountable; every time his eyes met those of Emily or Arabella,
he smirked and grinned; once, Wardle could have sworn he saw him wink.

<P>This alteration in the fat boy's demeanour, originated in his increased
sense of his own importance, and the dignity he acquired from having been
taken into the confidence of the young ladies; and the smirks, and grins,
and winks, were so many condescending assurances that they might depend
upon his fidelity. As these tokens were rather calculated to awaken suspicion
than allay it, and were somewhat embarrassing besides, they were occasionally
answered by a frown or shake of the head from Arabella, which the fat boy
considering as hints to be on his guard, expressed his perfect understanding
of, by smirking, grinning, and winking, with redoubled assiduity.

<P>"Joe," said Mr. Wardle, after an unsuccessful search in all his pockets,
"is my snuff-box on the sofa?"

<P>"No, sir," replied the fat boy.

<P>"Oh, I recollect; I left it on my dressing-table this morning," said
Wardle. "Run into the next room and fetch it."

<P>The fat boy went into the next room; and having been absent about a
minute, returned with the snuff-box, and the palest face that ever a fat
boy wore.

<P>"What's the matter with the boy!" exclaimed Wardle.

<P>"Nothen's the matter with me," replied Joe, nervously.

<P>"Have you been seeing any spirits?" inquired the old gentleman.

<P>"Or taking any?" added Ben Allen.

<P>"I think you're right," whispered Wardle across the table. "He is intoxicated,
I'm sure."

<P>Ben Allen replied that he thought he was; and as that gentleman had
seen a vast deal of the disease in question, Wardle was confirmed in an
impression which had been hovering about his mind for half an hour, and
at once arrived at the conclusion that the fat boy was drunk.

<P>"Just keep your eye upon him for a few minutes," murmured Wardle. "We
shall soon find out whether he is or not."

<P>The unfortunate youth had only interchanged a dozen words with Mr. Snodgrass:
that gentleman having implored him to make a private appeal to some friend
to release him, and then pushed him out with the snuff-box, lest his prolonged
absence should lead to a discovery. He ruminated a little with a most disturbed
expression of face, and left the room in search of Mary.

<P>But Mary had gone home after dressing her mistress, and the fat boy
came back again more disturbed than before.

<P>Wardle and Mr. Ben Allen exchanged glances.

<P>"Joe!" said Wardle.

<P>"Yes, sir."

<P>"What did you go away for?"

<P>The fat boy looked hopelessly in the face of everybody at table, and
stammered out, that he didn't know.

<P>"Oh," said Wardle, "you don't know, eh? Take this cheese to Mr. Pickwick."

<P>Now, Mr. Pickwick being in the very best health and spirits, had been
making himself perfectly delightful all dinner-time, and was at this moment
engaged in an energetic conversation with Emily and Mr. Winkle: bowing
his head, courteously, in the emphasis of his discourse, gently waving
his left hand to lend force to his observations, and all glowing with placid
smiles. He took a piece of cheese from the plate, and was on the point
of turning round to renew the conversation, when the fat boy, stooping
so as to bring his head on a level with that of Mr. Pickwick, pointed with
his thumb over his shoulder, and made the most horrible and hideous face
that was ever seen out of a Christmas pantomime.

<P>"Dear me!" said Mr. Pickwick, starting, "what a very -- eh?" He stopped,
for the fat boy had drawn himself up, and was, or pretended to be, fast
asleep.

<P>"What's the matter?" inquired Wardle.

<P>"This is such an extremely singular lad!" replied Mr. Pickwick, looking
uneasily at the boy. "It seems an odd thing to say, but upon my word I
am afraid that, at times, he is a little deranged."

<P>"Oh! Mr. Pickwick, pray don't say so," cried Emily and Arabella, both
at once.

<P>"I am not certain, of course," said Mr. Pickwick, amidst profound silence,
and looks of general dismay; "but his manner to me this moment was really
very alarming. Oh!" ejaculated Mr. Pickwick, suddenly jumping up with a
short scream. "I beg your pardon, ladies, but at that moment he ran some
sharp instrument into my leg. Really he is not safe."

<P>"He's drunk," roared old Wardle, passionately. "Ring the bell! Call
the waiters! He's drunk."

<P>"I ain't," said the fat boy, falling on his knees as his master seized
him by the collar. "I ain't drunk."

<P>"Then you're mad; that's worse. Call the waiters," said the old gentleman.

<P>"I ain't mad; I'm sensible," rejoined the fat boy, beginning to cry.

<P>"Then, what the devil do you run sharp instruments into Mr. Pickwick's
legs for?" inquired Wardle, angrily.

<P>"He wouldn't look at me," replied the boy. "I wanted to speak to him."

<P>"What did you want to say?" asked half a dozen voices at once.

<P>The fat boy gasped, looked at the bed-room door, gasped again, and wiped
two tears away with the knuckle of each of his forefingers.

<P>"What did you want to say?" demanded Wardle, shaking him.

<P>"Stop!" said Mr. Pickwick; "allow me. What did you wish to communicate
to me, my poor boy?"

<P>"I want to whisper to you," replied the fat boy.

<P>"You want to bite his ear off, I suppose," said Wardle. "Don't come
near him; he's vicious; ring the bell, and let him be taken down-stairs."

<P>Just as Mr. Winkle caught the bell-rope in his hand, it was arrested
by a general expression of astonishment; the captive lover, his face burning
with confusion, suddenly walked in from the bed-room, and made a comprehensive
bow to the company.

<P>"Hallo!" cried Wardle, releasing the fat boy's collar, and staggering
back, "What's this!"

<P>"I have been concealed in the next room, sir, since you returned," explained
Mr. Snodgrass.

<P>"Emily, my girl," said Wardle, reproachfully, "I detest meanness and
deceit; this is unjustifiable and indelicate in the highest degree. I don't
deserve this at your hands, Emily, indeed!"

<P>"Dear papa," said Emily, "Arabella knows -- everybody here knows --
Joe knows -- that I was no party to this concealment. Augustus, for Heaven's
sake, explain it!"

<P>Mr. Snodgrass, who had only waited for a hearing, at once recounted
how he had been placed in his then distressing predicament; how the fear
of giving rise to domestic dissensions had alone prompted him to avoid
Mr. Wardle on his entrance; how he merely meant to depart by another door,
but, finding it locked, had been compelled to stay against his will. It
was a painful situation to be placed in; but he now regretted it the less,
inasmuch as it afforded him an opportunity of acknowledging, before their
mutual friends, that he loved Mr. Wardle's daughter, deeply and sincerely;
that he was proud to avow that the feeling was mutual; and that if thousands
of miles were placed between them, or oceans rolled their waters, he could
never for an instant forget those happy days, when first -- and so on.

<P>Having delivered himself to this effect, Mr. Snodgrass bowed again,
looked into the crown of his hat, and stepped towards the door.

<P>"Stop!" shouted Wardle. "Why, in the name of all that's --"

<P>"Inflammable," mildly suggested Mr. Pickwick, who thought something
worse was coming.

<P>"Well -- that's inflammable," said Wardle, adopting the substitute;
"couldn't you say all this to me in the first instance?"

<P>"Or confide in me?" added Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"Dear, dear," said Arabella, taking up the defence, "what is the use
of asking all that now, especially when you know you had set your covetous
old heart on a richer son-in-law, and are so wild and fierce besides, that
everybody is afraid of you, except me. Shake hands with him, and order
him some dinner, for goodness gracious sake, for he looks half-starved;
and pray have your wine up at once, for you'll not be tolerable until you
have taken two bottles at least."

<P>The worthy old gentleman pulled Arabella's ear, kissed her without the
smallest scruple, kissed his daughter also with great affection, and shook
Mr. Snodgrass warmly by the hand.

<P>"She is right on one point at all events," said the old gentleman, cheerfully.
"Ring for the wine!"

<P>The wine came, and Perker came up-stairs at the same moment. Mr. Snodgrass
had dinner at a side table, and, when he had despatched it, drew his chair
next Emily, without the smallest opposition on the old gentleman's part.

<P>The evening was excellent. Little Mr. Perker came out wonderfully, told
various comic stories, and sang a serious song which was almost as funny
as the anecdotes. Arabella was very charming, Mr. Wardle very jovial, Mr.
Pickwick very harmonious, Mr. Ben Allen very uproarious, the lovers very
silent, Mr. Winkle very talkative, and all of them very happy.
