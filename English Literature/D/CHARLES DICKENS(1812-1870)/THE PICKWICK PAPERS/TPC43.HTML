<CENTER><FONT SIZE=-1>SHOWING HOW MR. SAMUEL WELLER GOT INTO DIFFICULTIES</FONT></CENTER>


<P>I<FONT SIZE=-1>N</FONT> a lofty room, ill-lighted and worse ventilated,
situate in Portugal Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, there sit nearly the
whole year round, one, two, three, or four gentlemen in wigs, as the case
may be, with little writing desks before them, constructed after the fashion
of those used by the judges of the land, barring the French polish. There
is a box of barristers on their right hand; there is an inclosure of insolvent
debtors on their left; and there is an inclined plane of most especially
dirty faces in their front. These gentlemen are the Commissioners of the
Insolvent Court, and the place in which they sit, is the Insolvent Court
itself.

<P>It is, and has been, time out of mind, the remarkable fate of this Court
to be, somehow or other, held and understood, by the general consent of
all the destitute shabby-genteel people in London, as their common resort,
and place of daily refuge. It is always full. The steams of beer and spirits
perpetually ascend to the ceiling, and, being condensed by the heat, roll
down the walls like rain; there are more old suits of clothes in it at
one time, than will be offered for sale in all Houndsditch in a twelvemonth;
more unwashed skins and grizzly beards than all the pumps and shavingshops
between Tyburn and Whitechapel could render decent, between sunrise and
sunset.

<P>It must not be supposed that any of these people have the least shadow
of business in, or the remotest connection with, the place they so indefatigably
attend. If they had, it would be no matter of surprise, and the singularity
of the thing would cease. Some of them sleep during the greater part of
the sitting; others carry small portable dinners wrapped in pocket-handkerchiefs
or sticking out of their worn-out pockets, and munch and listen with equal
relish; but no one among them was ever known to have the slightest personal
interest in any case that was ever brought forward. What-ever they do,
there they sit from the first moment to the last. When it is heavy rainy
weather, they all come in, wet through; and at such times the vapours of
the Court are like those of a fungus-pit.

<P>A casual visitor might suppose this place to be a Temple dedicated to
the Genius of Seediness. There is not a messenger or process-server attached
to it, who wears a coat that was made for him; not a tolerably fresh, or
wholesome-looking man in the whole establishment, except a little white-headed
apple-faced tipstaff, and even he, like an illconditioned cherry preserved
in brandy, seems to have artificially dried and withered up into a state
of preservation to which he can lay no natural claim. The very barristers'
wigs are ill-powdered, and their curls lack crispness.

<P>But the attorneys, who sit at a large bare table below the Commissioners,
are, after all, the greatest curiosities. The professional establishment
of the more opulent of these gentlemen, consists of a blue bag and a boy:
generally a youth of the Jewish persuasion. They have no fixed offices,
their legal business being transacted in the parlours of public-houses,
or the yards of prisons: whither they repair in crowds, and canvass for
customers after the manner of omnibus cads. They are of a greasy and mildewed
appearance; and if they can be said to have any vices at all, perhaps drinking
and cheating are the most conspicuous among them. Their residences are
usually on the outskirts of "the Rules," chiefly lying within a circle
of one mile from the obelisk in St. George's Fields. Their looks are not
prepossessing, and their manners are peculiar.

<P>Mr. Solomon Pell, one of this learned body, was a fat flabby pale man,
in a surtout which looked green one minute and brown the next: with a velvet
collar of the same chameleon tints. His forehead was narrow, his face wide,
his head large, and his nose all on one side, as if Nature, indignant with
the propensities she observed in him in his birth, had given it an angry
tweak which it had never recovered. Being short-necked and asthmatic, however,
he respired principally through this feature; so, perhaps, what it wanted
in ornament, it made up in usefulness.

<P>"I'm sure to bring him through it," said Mr. Pell.

<P>"Are you though?" replied the person to whom the assurance was pledged.

<P>"Certain sure," replied Pell; "but if he'd gone to any irregular practitioner,
mind you, I wouldn't have answered for the consequences."

<P>"Ah!" said the other, with open mouth.

<P>"No, that I wouldn't," said Mr. Pell; and he pursed up his lips, frowned,
and shook his head mysteriously.

<P>Now, the place where this discourse occurred, was the public-house just
opposite to the Insolvent Court; and the person with whom it was held,
was no other than the elder Mr. Weller, who had come there, to comfort
and console a friend, whose petition to be discharged under the Act was
to be that day heard, and whose attorney he was at that moment consulting.

<P>"And vere is George?" inquired the old gentleman.

<P>Mr. Pell jerked his head in the direction of a back parlour: whither
Mr. Weller at once repairing, was immediately greeted in the warmest and
most flattering manner by some half-dozen of his professional brethren,
in token of their gratification at his arrival. The insolvent gentleman,
who had contracted a speculative but imprudent passion for horsing long
stages, which had led to his present embarrassments, looked extremely well,
and was soothing the excitement of his feelings with shrimps and porter.

<P>The salutation between Mr. Weller and his friends was strictly confined
to the freemasonry of the craft; consisting of a jerking round of the right
wrist, and a tossing of the little finger into the air at the same time.
We once knew two famous coachmen (they are dead now, poor fellows) who
were twins, and between whom an unaffected and devoted attachment existed.
They passed each other on the Dover road, every day, for twenty-four years,
never exchanging any other greeting than this; and yet, when one died,
the other pined away, and soon afterwards followed him!

<P>"Vell, George," said Mr. Weller, senior, taking off his upper coat,
and seating himself with his accustomed gravity. "How is it? All right
behind, and full inside?"

<P>"All right, old feller," replied the embarrassed gentleman.

<P>"Is the grey mare made over to anybody?" inquired Mr. Weller, anxiously.

<P>George nodded in the affirmative.

<P>"Vell, that's all right," said Mr. Weller. "Coach taken care on, also?"

<P>"Con-signed in a safe quarter," replied George, wringing the heads off
half-a-dozen shrimps, and swallowing them without any more ado.

<P>"Wery good, wery good," said Mr. Weller. "Alvays see to the drag ven
you go down hill. Is the vay-bill all clear and straight for'erd?"

<P>"The schedule, sir," said Pell, guessing at Mr. Weller's meaning, "the
schedule is as plain and satisfactory as pen and ink can make it."

<P>Mr. Weller nodded in a manner which bespoke his inward approval of these
arrangements; and then, turning to Mr. Pell, said, pointing to his friend
George:

<P>"Ven do you take his cloths off?"

<P>"Why," replied Mr. Pell, "he stands third on the opposed list, and I
should think it would be his turn in about half an hour. I told my clerk
to come over and tell us when there was a chance."

<P>Mr. Weller surveyed the attorney from head to foot with great admiration,
and said emphatically:

<P>"And what'll you take, sir?"

<P>"Why, really," replied Mr. Pell, "you're very--. Upon my word and honour,
I'm not in the habit of--. It's so very early in the morning, that, actually,
I am almost--. Well, you may bring me three penn'orth of rum, my dear."

<P>The officiating damsel, who had anticipated the order before it was
given, set the glass of spirits before Pell, and retired.

<P>"Gentlemen," said Mr. Pell, looking round upon the company, "Success
to your friend! I don't like to boast, gentlemen; it's not my way; but
I can't help saying, that, if your friend hadn't been fortunate enough
to fall into hands that--but I won't say what I was going to say. Gentlemen,
my service to you." Having emptied the glass in a twinkling, Mr. Pell smacked
his lips, and looked complacently round on the assembled coachmen, who
evidently regarded him as a species of divinity.

<P>"Let me see," said the legal authority. "What was I a-saying, gentlemen?"

<P>"I think you was remarkin' as you wouldn't have no objection to another
o' the same, sir," said Mr. Weller, with grave facetiousness.

<P>"Ha, ha!" laughed Mr. Pell. "Not bad, not bad. A professional man, too!
At this time of the morning, it would be rather too good a--. Well, I don't
know, my dear--you <I>may</I> do that again, if you please. Hem!"

<P>This last sound was a solemn and dignified cough, in which Mr. Pell,
observing an indecent tendency to mirth in some of his auditors, considered
it due to himself to indulge.

<P>"The late Lord Chancellor, gentlemen, was very fond of me," said Mr.
Pell.

<P>"And wery creditable in him, too," interposed Mr. Weller.

<P>"Hear, hear," assented Mr. Pell's client. "Why shouldn't he be?"

<P>"Ah! Why, indeed!" said a very red-faced man, who had said nothing yet,
and who looked extremely unlikely to say anything more. "Why shouldn't
he?"

<P>A murmur of assent ran through the company.

<P>"I remember, gentlemen," said Mr. Pell, "dining with him on one occasion;--there
was only us two, but everything as splendid as if twenty people had been
expected--the great seal on a dumb-waiter at his right hand, and a man
in a bag-wig and suit of armour guarding the mace with a drawn sword and
silk stockings--which is perpetually done, gentlemen, night and day; when
he said, `Pell,' he said, `no false delicacy, Pell. You're a man of talent;
you can get anybody through the Insolvent Court, Pell; and your country
should be proud of you.' Those were his very words. `My Lord,' I said,
`you flatter me.'--`Pell,' he said, `if I do, I'm damned.'"

<P>"Did he say that?" inquired Mr. Weller.

<P>"He did," replied Pell.

<P>"Vell, then," said Mr. Weller, "I say Parliament ought to ha' took it
up; and if he'd been a poor man, they <I>would</I> ha' done it."

<P>"But, my dear friend," argued Mr. Pell, "it was in confidence."

<P>"In what?" said Mr. Weller.

<P>"In confidence."

<P>"Oh! wery good," replied Mr. Weller, after a little reflection. "If
he damned his-self in confidence, o' course that was another thing."

<P>"Of course it was," said Mr. Pell. "The distinction's obvious, you will
perceive."

<P>"Alters the case entirely," said Mr. Weller. "Go on, sir."

<P>"No, I will not go on, sir," said Mr. Pell, in a low and serious tone.
"You have reminded me, sir, that this conversation was private--private
and confidential, gentlemen. Gentlemen, I am a professional man. It may
be that I am a good deal looked up to, in my profession--it may be that
I am not. Most people know. I say nothing. Observations have already been
made, in this room, injurious to the reputation of my noble friend. You
will excuse me, gentlemen; I was imprudent. I feel that I have no right
to mention this matter without his concurrence. Thank you, sir; thank you."
Thus delivering himself, Mr. Pell thrust his hands into his pockets, and,
frowning grimly around, rattled three-halfpence with terrible determination.

<P>This virtuous resolution had scarcely been formed, when the boy and
the blue bag, who were inseparable companions, rushed violently into the
room, and said (at least the boy did, for the blue bag took no part in
the announcement) that the case was coming on directly. The intelligence
was no sooner received than the whole party hurried across the street,
and began to fight their way into Court--a preparatory ceremony, which
has been calculated to occupy, in ordinary cases, from twenty-five minutes
to thirty.

<P>Mr. Weller, being stout, cast himself at once into the crowd, with the
desperate hope of ultimately turning up in some place which would suit
him. His success was not quite equal to his expectations; for having neglected
to take his hat off, it was knocked over his eyes by some unseen person,
upon whose toes he had alighted with considerable force. Apparently, this
individual regretted his impetuosity immediately afterwards; for, muttering
an indistinct exclamation of surprise, he dragged the old man out into
the hall, and, after a violent struggle, released his head and face.

<P>"Samivel!" exclaimed Mr. Weller, when he was thus enabled to behold
his rescuer.

<P>"Sam nodded.

<P>"You're a dutiful and affectionate little boy, you are, ain't you?"
said Mr. Weller, "to come a bonnetin' your father in his old age?"

<P>"How should I know who you wos?" responded the son. "Do you s'pose I
wos to tell you by the weight o' your foot?"

<P>"Vell, that's wery true, Sammy," replied Mr. Weller, mollified at once;
"but wot are you a doin' on here? Your gov'nor can't do no good here, Sammy.
They won't pass that werdick, they won't pass it, Sammy." And Mr. Weller
shook his head, with legal solemnity.

<P>"Wot a perwerse old file it is!" exclaimed Sam, "alvays a goin' on about
werdicks and alleybis, and that. Who said anything about the werdick?"

<P>Mr. Weller made no reply, but once more shook his head most learnedly.

<P>"Leave off rattlin' that 'ere nob o' yourn, if you don't want it to
come off the springs altogether," said Sam impatiently, "and behave reasonable.
I vent all the vay down to the Markis o' Granby, arter you, last night."

<P>"Did you see the Marchioness o' Granby, Sammy?" inquired Mr. Weller,
with a sigh.

<P>"Yes, I, did," replied Sam.

<P>"How wos the dear creetur a lookin'?"

<P>"Wery queer," said Sam, "I think she's a injurin' herself gradivally
vith too much o' that 'ere pine-apple rum, and other strong medicines o'
the same natur."

<P>"You don't mean that, Sammy?" said the senior, earnestly.

<P>"I do, indeed," replied the junior.

<P>Mr. Weller seized his son's hand, clasped it, and let it fall. There
was an expression on his countenance in doing so--not of dismay or apprehension,
but partaking more of the sweet and gentle character of hope. A gleam of
resignation, and even of cheerfulness, passed over his face too, as he
slowly said, "I ain't quite certain, Sammy; I wouldn't like to say I wos
altogether positive, in case of any subsekent disappintment, but I rayther
think, my boy, I rayther think, that the shepherd's got the liver complaint!"

<P>"Does he look bad?" inquired Sam.

<P>"He's uncommon pale," replied his father, "'cept about the nose, wich
is redder than ever. His appetite is wery so-so, but he imbibes wunderful."

<P>Some thoughts of the rum appeared to obtrude themselves on Mr. Weller's
mind, as he said this; for he looked gloomy and thoughtful; but he very
shortly recovered, as was testified by a perfect alphabet of winks, in
which he was only wont to indulge when particularly pleased.

<P>"Vell, now," said Sam, "about my affair. Just open them ears o' yourn,
and don't say nothin' till I've done." With this brief preface, Sam related,
as succinctly as he could, the last memorable conversation he had had with
Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"Stop there by himself, poor creetur!" exclaimed the elder Mr. Weller,
"without nobody to take his part! It can't be done, Samivel, it can't be
done."

<P>"O' course it can't," asserted Sam: "I know'd that, afore I came."

<P>"Wy, they'll eat him up alive, Sammy," exclaimed Mr. Weller.

<P>Sam nodded his concurrence in the opinion.

<P>"He goes in rayther raw, Sammy," said Mr. Weller metaphorically, "and
he'll come out, done so ex-ceedin' brown, that his most familiar friends
won't know him. Roast pigeon's nothin' to it, Sammy."

<P>Again Sam Weller nodded.

<P>"It oughtn't to be, Samivel," said Mr. Weller, gravely.

<P>"It mustn't be," said Sam.

<P>"Cert'nly not," said Mr. Weller.

<P>"Vell now," said Sam, "you've been a prophecyin' away, wery fine, like
a red-faced Nixon as the sixpenny books gives picters on."

<P>"Who wos he, Sammy?" inquired Mr. Weller.

<P>"Never mind who he was," retorted Sam; "he warn't a coachman; that's
enough for you."

<P>"I know'd a ostler o' that name," said Mr. Weller, musing.

<P>"It warn't him," said Sam. "This here gen'l'm'n was a prophet."

<P>"Wot's a prophet?" inquired Mr. Weller, looking sternly on his son.

<P>"Wy, a man as tells what's a goin' to happen," replied Sam.

<P>"I wish I'd know'd him, Sammy," said Mr. Weller. "P'raps he might ha'
throw'd a small light on that 'ere liver complaint as we wos a speakin'
on, just now. Hows'ever, if he's dead, and ain't left the bisness to nobody,
there's an end on it. Go on, Sammy," said Mr. Weller, with a sigh.

<P>"Well," said Sam, "you've been a prophecyin' avay, about wot'll happen
to the gov'nor if he's left alone. Don't you see any vay o' takin' care
on him?"

<P>"No, I don't, Sammy," said Mr. Weller, with a reflective visage.

<P>"No vay at all?" inquired Sam.

<P>"No vay," said Mr. Weller, "unless"--and a gleam of intelligence lighted
up his countenance as he sunk his voice to a whisper, and applied his mouth
to the ear of his offspring: "unless it is getting him out in a turn-up
bedstead, unbeknown to the turnkeys, Sammy, or dressin' him up like a old
'ooman vith a green wail."

<P>Sam Weller received both of these suggestions with unexpected contempt,
and again propounded his question.

<P>"No," said the old gentleman; "if he von't let you stop there, I see
no vay at all. It's no thoroughfare, Sammy, no thoroughfare."

<P>"Well, then, I'll tell you wot it is," said Sam, "I'll trouble you for
the loan of five-and-twenty pound."

<P>"Wot good 'ull that do?" inquired Mr. Weller.

<P>"Never mind," replied Sam. "P'raps you may ask for it, five minits artervards;
p'raps I may say I von't pay, and cut up rough. You von't think o' arrestin'
your own son for the money, and sendin' him off to the Fleet, will you,
you unnat'ral wagabone?"

<P>At this reply of Sam's, the father and son exchanged a complete code
of telegraphic nods and gestures, after which, the elder Mr. Weller sat
himself down on a stone step, and laughed till he was purple.

<P>"Wot a old image it is!" exclaimed Sam, indignant at this loss of time.
"What are you a settin' down there for, con-wertin' your face into a street-door
knocker, wen there's so much to be done. Where's the money?"

<P>"In the boot, Sammy, in the boot," replied Mr. Weller, composing his
features. "Hold my hat, Sammy."

<P>Having divested himself of this encumbrance, Mr. Weller gave his body
a sudden wrench to one side, and, by a dexterous twist, contrived to get
his right hand into a most capacious pocket, from whence, after a great
deal of panting and exertion, he extricated a pocket-book of the large
octavo size, fastened by a huge leathern strap. From this ledger he drew
forth a couple of whip-lashes, three or four buckles, a little sample-bag
of corn, and finally a small roll of very dirty bank-notes: from which
he selected the required amount, which he handed over to Sam.

<P>"And now, Sammy," said the old gentleman, when the whip-lashes, and
the buckles, and the samples, had been all put back, and the book once
more deposited at the bottom of the same pocket, "Now, Sammy, I know a
gen'l'm'n here, as'll do the rest o' the bisness for us, in no time--a
limb o' the law, Sammy, as has got brains like the frogs, dispersed all
over his body, and reachin' to the wery tips of his fingers; a friend of
the Lord Chancellorship's, Sammy, who'd only have to tell him what he wanted,
and he'd lock you up for life, if that wos all."

<P>"I say," said Sam, "none o' that."

<P>"None o' wot?" inquired Mr. Weller.

<P>"Wy, none o' them unconstitootional ways o' doing it," retorted Sam.
"The have-his-carcase, next to the perpetual motion, is vun of the blessedest
things as wos ever made. I've read that 'ere in the newspapers, wery of'en."

<P>"Well, wot's that got to do vith it?" inquired Mr. Weller.

<P>"Just this here," said Sam, "that I'll patronise the inwention, and
go in, that vay. No visperin's to the Chancellorship, I don't like the
notion. It mayn't be altogether safe, vith reference to gettin' out agin."

<P>Deferring to his son's feeling upon this point, Mr. Weller at once sought
the erudite Solomon Pell, and acquainted him with his desire to issue a
writ, instantly, for the sum of twenty-five pounds, and costs of process;
to be executed without delay upon the body of one Samuel Weller; the charges
thereby incurred, to be paid in advance to Solomon Pell.

<P>The attorney was in high glee, for the embarrassed coachhorser was ordered
to be discharged forthwith. He highly approved of Sam's attachment to his
master; declared that it strongly reminded him of his own feelings of devotion
to his friend, the Chancellor; and at once led the elder Mr. Weller down
to the Temple, to swear the affidavit of debt, which the boy, with the
assistance of the blue bag, had drawn up on the spot.

<P>Meanwhile, Sam, having been formally introduced to the whitewashed gentleman
and his friends, as the offspring of Mr. Weller, of the Belle Savage, was
treated with marked distinction, and invited to regale himself with them
in honour of the occasion; an invitation which he was by no means backward
in accepting.

<P>The mirth of gentlemen of this class is of a grave and quiet character,
usually; but the present instance was one of peculiar festivity, and they
relaxed in proportion. After some rather tumultuous toasting of the Chief
Commissioner and Mr. Solomon Pell, who had that day displayed such transcendent
abilities, a mottled-faced gentleman in a blue shawl proposed that somebody
should sing a song. The obvious suggestion was, that the mottled-faced
gentleman, being anxious for a song, should sing it himself; but this the
mottled-faced gentleman sturdily, and somewhat offensively, declined to
do. Upon which, as is not unusual in such cases, a rather angry colloquy
ensued.

<P>"Gentlemen," said the coach-horser, "rather than disturb the harmony
of this delightful occasion, perhaps Mr. Samuel Weller will oblige the
company."

<P>"Raly, gentlemen," said Sam, "I'm not wery much in the habit o' singin'
without the instrument; but anythin' for a quiet life, as the man said
wen he took the sitivation at the lighthouse."

<P>With this prelude, Mr. Samuel Weller burst at once into the following
wild and beautiful legend, which, under the impression that it is not generally
known, we take the liberty of quoting. We would beg to call particular
attention to the monosyllable at the end of the second and fourth lines,
which not only enables the singer to take breath at those points, but greatly
assists the metre. ROMANCE I&nbsp;<poem><stanza><l>Bold Turpin vunce, on

<P>"I maintain that that 'ere song's personal to the cloth," said the mottled-faced
gentleman, interrupting it at this point. "I demand the name o' that coachman."

<P>"Nobody know'd," replied Sam. "He hadn't got his card in his pocket."

<P>"I object to the introduction o' politics," said the mottle-faced gentleman.
"I submit that, in the present company, that 'ere song's political; and,
wot's much the same, that it am't true. I say that that coachman did <I>not</I>
run away; but that he died game--game as pheasants; and I won't hear nothin'
said to the contrairey."

<P>As the mottled-faced gentleman spoke with great energy and determination:
and as the opinions of the company seemed divided on the subject: it threatened
to give rise to fresh altercation, when Mr. Weller and Mr. Pell most opportunely
arrived.

<P>"All right, Sammy," said Mr. Weller.

<P>"The officer will be here at four o'clock," said Mr. Pell. "I suppose
you won't run away meanwhile, eh? Ha! Ha!"

<P>"P'raps my cruel pa 'ull relent afore then," replied Sam, with a broad
grin.

<P>"Not I," said the elder Mr. Weller.

<P>"Do," said Sam.

<P>"Not on no account," replied the inexorable creditor.

<P>"I'll give bills for the amount, at sixpence a month," said Sam.

<P>"I won't take 'em," said Mr. Weller.

<P>"Ha, ha, ha! very good, very good," said Mr. Solomon Pell, who was making
out his little bill of costs; "a very amusing incident indeed! Benjamin,
copy that." And Mr. Pell smiled again, as he called Mr. Weller's attention
to the amount.

<P>"Thank you, thank you," said the professional gentleman, taking up another
of the greasy notes as Mr. Weller took it from the pocket-book. "Three
ten and one ten is five. Much obliged to you, Mr. Weller. Your son is a
most deserving young man, very much so indeed, sir. It's a very pleasant
trait in a young man's character, very much so," added Mr. Pell, smiling
smoothly round, as he buttoned up the money.

<P>"Wot a game it is!" said the elder Mr. Weller, with a chuckle. "A reg'lar
prodigy son!"

<P>"Prodigal, prodigal son, sir," suggested Mr. Pell, mildly.

<P>"Never mind, sir," said Mr. Weller, with dignity. "I know wot's o'clock,
sir. Wen I don't, I'll ask you, sir."

<P>By the time the officer arrived, Sam had made himself so extremely popular,
that the congregated gentlemen determined to see him to prison in a body.
So, off they set; the plaintiff and defendant walking arm-in-arm; the officer
in front; and eight stout coachmen bringing up the rear. At Serjeant's
Inn Coffee-house the whole party halted to refresh, and, the legal arrangements
being completed, the procession moved on again.

<P>Some little commotion was occasioned in Fleet Street, by the pleasantry
of the eight gentlemen in the flank, who persevered in walking four abreast;
it was also found necessary to leave the mottled-faced gentleman behind,
to fight a ticket-porter, it being arranged that his friends should call
for him as they came back. Nothing but these little incidents occurred
on the way. When they reached the gate of the Fleet, the cavalcade, taking
the time from the plaintiff, gave three tremendous cheers for the defendant,
and, after having shaken hands all round, left him.

<P>Sam, having been formally delivered into the warden's custody, to the
intense astonishment of Roker, and to the evident emotion of even the phlegmatic
Neddy, passed at once into the prison, walked straight to his master's
room, and knocked at the door.

<P>"Come in," said Mr. Pickwick.

<P>Sam appeared, pulled off his hat, and smiled.

<P>"Ah, Sam, my good lad!" said Mr. Pickwick, evidently delighted to see
his humble friend again; "I had no intention of hurting your feelings yesterday,
my faithful fellow, by what I said. Put down your hat, Sam, and let me
explain my meaning, a little more at length."

<P>"Won't presently do, sir?" inquired Sam.

<P>"Certainly," said Mr. Pickwick; "but why not now?"

<P>"I'd rayther not now, sir," rejoined Sam.

<P>"Why?" inquired Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"'Cause--" said Sam, hesitating.

<P>"Because of what?" inquired Mr. Pickwick, alarmed at his follower's
manner. "Speak out, Sam."

<P>"'Cause," rejoined Sam; "'cause I've got a little bisness as I want
to do."

<P>"What business?" inquired Mr. Pickwick, surprised at Sam's confused
manner.

<P>"Nothin' partickler, sir," replied Sam.

<P>"Oh, if it's nothing particular," said Mr. Pickwick, with a smile, "you
can speak with me first."

<P>"I think I'd better see arter it at once," said Sam, still hesitating.

<P>Mr. Pickwick looked amazed, but said nothing.

<P>"The fact is," said Sam, stopping short.

<P>"Well!" said Mr. Pickwick. "Speak out, Sam."

<P>"Why, the fact is," said Sam, with a desperate effort, "P'raps I'd better
see arter my bed afore I do anythin' else."

<P>"<I>Your bed!</I>" exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, in astonishment.

<P>"Yes, my bed, sir," replied Sam. "I'm a pris'ner. I was arrested, this
here wery arternoon, for debt."

<P>"You arrested for debt!" exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, sinking into a chair.

<P>"Yes, for debt, sir," replied Sam. "And the man as puts me in, 'ull
never let me out, till you go yourself."

<P>"Bless my heart and soul!" ejaculated Mr. Pickwick. "What do you mean?"

<P>"Wot I say, sir," rejoined Sam. "If it's forty year to come, I shall
be a pris'ner, and I'm wery glad on it, and if it had been Newgate, it
would ha' been just the same. Now the murder's out, and, damme, there's
an end on it!"

<P>With these words, which he repeated with great emphasis and violence,
Sam Weller dashed his hat upon the ground, in a most unusual state of excitement;
and then, folding his arms, looked firmly and fixedly in his master's face.
