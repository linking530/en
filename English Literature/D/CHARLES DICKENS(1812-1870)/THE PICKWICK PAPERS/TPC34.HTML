<CENTER><FONT SIZE=-1>IS WHOLLY DEVOTED TO A FULL AND FAITHFUL REPORT OF
THE MEMORABLE TRIAL OF BARDELL AGAINST PICKWICK</FONT></CENTER>


<P>"I <FONT SIZE=-1>WONDER</FONT> what the foreman of the jury, whoever
he'll be, has got for breakfast," said Mr. Snodgrass, by way of keeping
up a conversation on the eventful morning of the fourteenth of February.

<P>"Ah!" said Perker, "I hope he's got a good one."

<P>"Why so?" inquired Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"Highly important; very important, my dear sir," replied Perker. "A
good, contented, well-breakfasted juryman, is a capital thing to get hold
of. Discontented or hungry jurymen, my dear sir, always find for the plaintiff."

<P>"Bless my heart," said Mr. Pickwick, looking very blank; "what do they
do that for?"

<P>"Why, I don't know," replied the little man, coolly; "saves time, I
suppose. If it's near dinner-time, the foreman takes out his watch when
the jury has retired, and says, `Dear me, gentlemen, ten minutes to five,
I declare! I dine at five, gentlemen.' `So do I,' says everybody else,
except two men who ought to have dined at three, and seem more than half
disposed to stand out in consequence. The foreman smiles, and puts up his
watch:--`Well, gentlemen, what do we say, plaintiff or defendant, gentlemen?
I rather think, so far as I am concerned, gentlemen,--I say, I rather think,--but
don't let that influence you--I <I>rather</I> think the plaintiff's the
man.' Upon this, two or three other men are sure to say that they think
so too--as of course they do; and then they get on very unanimously and
comfortably. Ten minutes past nine!" said the little man, looking at his
watch. "Time we were off, my dear sir; breach of promise trial--court is
generally full in such cases. You had better ring for a coach, my dear
sir, or we shall be rather late."

<P>Mr. Pickwick immediately rang the bell; and a coach having been procured,
the four Pickwickians and Mr. Perker ensconced themselves therein, and
drove to Guildhall; Sam Weller, Mr. Lowten, and the blue bag, following
in a cab.

<P>"Lowten," said Perker, when they reached the outer hall of the court,
"put Mr. Pickwick's friends in the students' box; Mr. Pickwick himself
had better sit by me. This way, my dear sir, this way." Taking Mr. Pickwick
by the coat-sleeve, the little man led him to the low seat just beneath
the desks of the King's Counsel, which is constructed for the convenience
of attorneys, who from that spot can whisper into the ear of the leading
counsel in the case, any instructions that may be necessary during the
progress of the trial. The occupants of this seat are invisible to the
great body of spectators, inasmuch as they sit on a much lower level than
either the barristers or the audience, whose seats are raised above the
floor. Of course they have their backs to both, and their faces towards
the judge.

<P>"That's the witness-box, I suppose?" said Mr. Pickwick, pointing to
a kind of pulpit, with a brass rail, on his left hand.

<P>"That's the witness-box, my dear sir," replied Perker, disinterring
a quantity of papers from the blue bag, which Lowten had just deposited
at his feet.

<P>"And that," said Mr. Pickwick, pointing to a couple of enclosed seats
on his right, "that's where the jurymen sit, is it not?"

<P>"The identical place, my dear sir," replied Perker, tapping the lid
of his snuff-box.

<P>Mr. Pickwick stood up in a state of great agitation, and took a glance
at the court. There were already a pretty large sprinkling of spectators
in the gallery, and a numerous muster of gentlemen in wigs, in the barristers'
seats: who presented, as a body, all that pleasing and extensive variety
of nose and whisker for which the bar of England is so justly celebrated.
Such of the gentlemen as had a brief to carry, carried it in as conspicuous
a manner as possible, and occasionally scratched their noses therewith,
to impress the fact more strongly on the observation of the spectators.
Other gentlemen, who had no briefs to show, carried under their arms goodly
octavos, with a red label behind, and that underdone-pie-crust-coloured
cover, which is technically known as "law calf." Others, who had neither
briefs nor books, thrust their hands into their pockets, and looked as
wise as they conveniently could; others, again, moved here and there with
great restlessness and earnestness of manner, content to awaken thereby
the admiration and astonishment of the uninitiated strangers. The whole,
to the great wonderment of Mr. Pickwick, were divided into little groups,
who were chatting and discussing the news of the day in the most unfeeling
manner possible,--just as if no trial at all were coming on.

<P>A bow from Mr. Phunky, as he entered, and took his seat behind the row
appropriated to the King's Counsel, attracted Mr. Pickwick's attention;
and he had scarcely returned it, when Mr. Serjeant Snubbin appeared, followed
by Mr. Mallard, who half hid the Serjeant behind a large crimson bag, which
he placed on his table, and, after shaking hands with Perker, withdrew.
Then there entered two or three more Serjeants; and among them, one with
a fat body and a red face, who nodded in a friendly manner to Mr. Serjeant
Snubbin, and said it was a fine morning.

<P>"Who's that red-faced man, who said it was a fine morning, and nodded
to our counsel?" whispered Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz," replied Perker. "He's opposed to us; he leads
on the other side. That gentleman behind him is Mr. Skimpin, his junior."

<P>Mr. Pickwick was on the point of inquiring, with great abhorrence of
the man's cold-blooded villainy, how Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz, who was counsel
for the opposite party, dared to presume to tell Mr. Serjeant Snubbin,
who was counsel for him, that it was a fine morning, when he was interrupted
by a general rising of the barristers, and a loud cry of "Silence!" from
the officers of the court. Looking round, he found that this was caused
by the entrance of the judge.

<P>"Mr. Justice Stareleigh (who sat in the absence of the Chief Justice,
occasioned by indisposition), was a most particularly short man, and so
fat, that he seemed all face and waistcoat. He rolled in, upon two little
turned legs, and having bobbed gravely to the bar, who bobbed gravely to
him, put his little legs underneath his table, and his little three-cornered
hat upon it; and when Mr. Justice Stareleigh had done this, all you could
see of him was two queer little eyes, one broad pink face, and somewhere
about half of a big and very comical-looking wig.

<P>The judge had no sooner taken his seat, than the officer on the floor
of the court called out "Silence!" in a commanding tone, upon which another
officer in the gallery cried "Silence!" in an angry manner, whereupon three
or four more ushers shouted "Silence!" in a voice of indignant remonstrance.
This being done, a gentleman in black, who sat below the judge, proceeded
to call over the names of the jury; and after a great deal of bawling,
it was discovered that only ten special jurymen were present. Upon this,
Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz prayed a <I>tales</I>; the gentleman in black then
proceeded to press into the special jury, two of the common jurymen; and
a green-grocer and a chemist were caught directly.

<P>"Answer to your names, gentlemen, that you may be sworn," said the gentleman
in black. "Richard Upwitch."

<P>"Here," said the green-grocer.

<P>"Thomas Groffin."

<P>"Here," said the chemist.

<P>"Take the book, gentlemen. You shall well and truly try--"

<P>"I beg this court's pardon," said the chemist, who was a tall, thin,
yellow-visaged man, "but I hope this court will excuse my attendance."

<P>"On what grounds, sir?" said Mr. Justice Stareleigh.

<P>"I have no assistant, my Lord," said the chemist.

<P>"I can't help that, sir," replied Mr. Justice Stareleigh. "You should
hire one."

<P>"I can't afford it, my Lord," rejoined the chemist.

<P>"Then you ought to be able to afford it, sir," said the judge, reddening;
for Justice Stareleigh's temper bordered on the irritable, and brooked
not contradiction.

<P>"I know I <I>ought</I> to do, if I got on as well as I deserved, but
I don't, my Lord," answered the chemist.

<P>"Swear the gentleman," said the judge, peremptorily.

<P>The officer had got no further than the "You shall well and truly try,"
when he was again interrupted by the chemist.

<P>"I am to be sworn, my Lord, am I?" said the chemist.

<P>"Certainly, sir," replied the testy little judge.

<P>"Very well, my Lord," replied the chemist, in a resigned manner. "Then
there'll be murder before this trial's over; that's all. Swear me, if you
please, sir;" and sworn the chemist was, before the judge could find words
to utter.

<P>"I merely wanted to observe, my Lord," said the chemist, taking his
seat with great deliberation, "that I've left nobody but an errand-boy
in my shop. He is a very nice boy, my Lord, but he is not acquainted with
drugs; and I know that the prevailing impression on his mind is, that Epsom
salts means oxalic acid; and syrup of senna, laudanum. That's all, my Lord."
With this, the tall chemist composed himself into a comfortable attitude,
and, assuming a pleasant expression of countenance, appeared to have prepared
himself for the worst.

<P>Mr. Pickwick was regarding the chemist with feelings of the deepest
horror, when a slight sensation was perceptible in the body of the court;
and immediately afterwards Mrs. Bardell, supported by Mrs. Cluppins, was
led in, and placed in a drooping state, at the other end of the seat on
which Mr. Pickwick sat. An extra sized umbrella was then handed in by Mr.
Dodson, and a pair of pattens by Mr. Fogg, each of whom had prepared a
most sympathising and melancholy face for the occasion. Mrs. Sanders then
appeared, leading in Master Bardell. At sight of her child, Mrs. Bardell
started; suddenly recollecting herself, she kissed him in a frantic manner;
then relapsing into a state of hysterical imbecility, the good lady requested
to be informed where she was. In reply to this, Mrs. Cluppins and Mrs.
Sanders turned their heads away and wept, while Messrs. Dodson and Fogg
intreated the plaintiff to compose herself. Serjeant Buzfuz rubbed his
eyes very hard with a large white handkerchief, and gave an appealing look
towards the jury, while the judge was visibly affected, and several of
the beholders tried to cough down their emotions.

<P>"Very good notion that, indeed," whispered Perker to Mr. Pickwick. "Capital
fellows those Dodson and Fogg; excellent ideas of effect, my dear sir,
excellent."

<P>As Perker spoke, Mrs. Bardell began to recover by slow degrees, while
Mrs. Cluppins, after a careful survey of Master Bardell's buttons and the
button-holes to which they severally belonged, placed him on the floor
of the court in front of his mother,--a commanding position in which he
could not fail to awaken the full commiseration and sympathy of both judge
and jury. This was not done without considerable opposition, and many tears,
on the part of the young gentleman himself, who had certain inward misgivings
that the placing him within the full glare of the judge's eye was only
a formal prelude to his being immediately ordered away for instant execution,
or for transportation beyond the seas, during the whole term of his natural
life, at the very least.

<P>"Bardell and Pickwick," cried the gentleman in black, calling on the
case, which stood first on the list.

<P>"I am for the plaintiff, my Lord," said Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz.

<P>"Who is with you, brother Bufzuz?" said the judge. Mr. Skimpin bowed,
to intimate that he was.

<P>"I appear for the defendant, my Lord," said Mr. Serjeant Snubbin.

<P>"Anybody with you, brother Snubbin?" inquired the court.

<P>"Mr. Phunky, my Lord," replied Serjeant Snubbin.

<P>"Serjeant Buzfuz and Mr. Skimpin for the plaintiff," said the judge,
writing down the names in his note-book, and reading as he wrote; "for
the defendant, Serjeant Snubbin and Mr. Monkey."

<P>"Beg your Lordship's pardon, Phunky."

<P>"Oh, very good," said the judge; "I never had the pleasure of hearing
the gentleman's name before." Here Mr. Phunky bowed and smiled, and the
judge bowed and smiled too, and then Mr. Phunky, blushing into the very
whites of his eyes, tried to look as if he didn't know that everybody was
gazing at him: a thing which no man ever succeeded in doing yet, or in
all reasonable probability, ever will.

<P>"Go on," said the judge.

<P>The ushers again called silence, and Mr. Skimpin proceeded to "open
the case"; and the case appeared to have very little inside it when he
had opened it, for he kept such particulars as he knew, completely to himself,
and sat down, after a lapse of three minutes, leaving the jury in precisely
the same advanced stage of wisdom as they were in before.

<P>Serjeant Buzfuz then rose with all the majesty and dignity which the
grave nature of the proceedings demanded, and having whispered to Dodson,
and conferred briefly with Fogg, pulled his gown over his shoulders, settled
his wig, and addressed the jury.

<P>Serjeant Buzfuz began by saying, that never, in the whole course of
his professional experience--never, from the very first moment of his applying
himself to the study and practice of the law--had he approached a case
with feelings of such deep emotion, or with such a heavy sense of the responsibility
imposed upon him--a responsibility, he would say, which he could never
have supported, were he not buoyed up and sustained by a conviction so
strong, that it amounted to positive certainty that the cause of truth
and justice, or, in other words, the cause of his much-injured and most
oppressed client, must prevail with the high-minded and intelligent dozen
of men whom he now saw in that box before him.

<P>Counsel usually begin in this way, because it puts the jury on the very
best terms with themselves, and makes them think what sharp fellows they
must be. A visible effect was produced immediately; several jurymen beginning
to take voluminous notes with the utmost eagerness.

<P>"You have heard from my learned friend, gentlemen," continued Serjeant
Buzfuz, well knowing that, from the learned friend alluded to, the gentlemen
of the jury had heard just nothing at all--"you have heard from my learned
friend, gentlemen, that this is an action for a breach of promise of marriage,
in which the damages are laid at 1,500. But you have not heard from my
learned friend, inasmuch as it did not come within my learned friend's
province to tell you, what are the facts and circumstances of the case.
Those facts and circumstances, gentlemen, you shall hear detailed by me,
and proved by the unimpeachable female whom I will place in that box before
you."

<P>Here Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz, with a tremendous emphasis on the word "box,"
smote his table with a mighty sound, and glanced at Dodson and Fogg, who
nodded admiration of the serjeant, and indignant defiance of the defendant.

<P>"The plaintiff, gentlemen," continued Serjeant Buzfuz, in a soft and
melancholy voice, "the plaintiff is a widow; yes, gentlemen, a widow. The
late Mr. Bardell, after enjoying, for many years, the esteem and confidence
of his sovereign, as one of the guardians of his royal revenues, glided
almost imperceptibly from the world, to seek elsewhere for that repose
and peace which a custom-house can never afford."

<P>At this pathetic description of the decease of Mr. Bardell, who had
been knocked on the head with a quart-pot in a public-house cellar, the
learned serjeant's voice faltered, and he proceeded with emotion:

<P>"Some time before his death, he had stamped his likeness upon a little
boy. With this little boy, the only pledge of her departed exciseman, Mrs.
Bardell shrunk from the world, and courted the retirement and tranquillity
of Goswell Street; and here she placed in her front parlour-window a written
placard, bearing this inscription--`Apartments furnished for a single gentleman.
Inquire within.'" Here Serjeant Buzfuz paused, while several gentlemen
of the jury took a note of the document.

<P>"There is no date to that, is there, sir?" inquired a juror.

<P>"There is no date, gentlemen," replied Serjeant Buzfuz; "but I am instructed
to say that it was put in the plaintiff's parlour-window just this time
three years. I intreat the attention of the jury to the wording of this
document, `Apartments furnished for a single gentlemen'! Mrs. Bardell's
opinions of the opposite sex, gentlemen, were derived from a long contemplation
of the inestimable qualities of her lost husband. She had no fear, she
had no distrust, she had no suspicion, all was confidence and reliance.
`Mr. Bardell,' said the widow; `Mr. Bardell was a man of honour, Mr. Bardell
was a man of his word, Mr. Bardell was no deceiver, Mr. Bardell was once
a single gentleman himself; <I>to</I> single gentlemen I look for protection,
for assistance, for comfort, and for consolation; <I>in</I> single gentlemen
I shall perpetually see something to remind me of what Mr. Bardell was,
when he first won my young and untried affections; to a single gentleman,
then, shall my lodgings be let.' Actuated by this beautiful and touching
impulse (among the best impulses of our imperfect nature, gentlemen), the
lonely and desolate widow dried her tears, furnished her first floor, caught
the innocent boy to her maternal bosom, and put the bill up in her parlour-window.
Did it remain there long? No. The serpent was on the watch, the train was
laid, the mine was preparing, the sapper and miner was at work. Before
the bill had been in the parlour-window three days--three days--gentlemen--a
Being, erect upon two legs, and bearing all the outward semblance of a
man, and not of a monster, knocked at the door of Mrs. Bardell's house.
He inquired within; he took the lodgings; and on the very next day he entered
into possession of them. This man was Pickwick--Pickwick, the defendant."

<P>Serjeant Buzfuz, who had proceeded with such volubility that his face
was perfectly crimson, here paused for breath. The silence awoke Mr. Justice
Stareleigh, who immediately wrote down something with a pen without any
ink in it, and looked unusually profound, to impress the jury with the
belief that he always thought most deeply with his eyes shut. Serjeant
Buzfuz proceeded.

<P>"Of this man Pickwick I will say little; the subject presents but few
attractions; and I, gentlemen, am not the man, nor are you, gentlemen,
the men, to delight in the contemplation of revolting heartlessness, and
of systematic villainy."

<P>Here Mr. Pickwick, who had been writhing in silence for some time, gave
a violent start, as if some vague idea of assaulting Serjeant Buzfuz, in
the august presence of justice and law, suggested itself to his mind. An
admonitory gesture from Perker restrained him, and he listened to the learned
gentleman's continuation with a look of indignation, which contrasted forcibly
with the admiring faces of Mrs. Cluppins and Mrs. Sanders.

<P>"I say systematic villainy, gentlemen," said Serjeant Buzfuz, looking
through Mr. Pickwick, and talking <I>at</I> him; "and when I say systematic
villainy, let me tell the defendant Pickwick, if he be in court, as I am
informed he is, that it would have been more decent in him, more becoming,
in better judgment, and in better taste, if he had stopped away. Let me
tell him, gentlemen, that any gestures of dissent or disapprobation in
which he may indulge in this court will not go down with you; that you
will know how to value and how to appreciate them; and let me tell him
further, as my lord will tell you, gentlemen, that a counsel, in the discharge
of his duty to his client, is neither to be intimidated, nor bullied, nor
put down; and that any attempt to do either the one or the other, or the
first, or the last, will recoil on the head of the attempter, be he plaintiff
or be he defendant, be his name Pickwick, or Noakes, or Stoakes, or Stiles,
or Brown, or Thompson."

<P>This little divergence from the subject in hand, had of course, the
intended effect of turning all eyes to Mr. Pickwick. Serjeant Buzfuz, having
partially recovered from the state of moral elevation into which he had
lashed himself, resumed:

<P>"I shall show you, gentlemen, that for two years Pickwick continued
to reside constantly, and without interruption or intermission, at Mrs.
Bardell's house. I shall show you that Mrs. Bardell, during the whole of
that time waited on him, attended to his comforts, cooked his meals, looked
out his linen for the washerwoman when it went abroad, darned, aired, and
prepared it for wear, when it came home, and, in short, enjoyed his fullest
trust and confidence. I shall show you that, on many occasions, he gave
halfpence, and on some occasions even sixpences, to her little boy; and
I shall prove to you, by a witness whose testimony it will be impossible
for my learned friend to weaken or controvert, that on one occasion he
patted the boy on the head, and, after inquiring whether he had won any
<I>alley tors</I> or <I>commoneys</I> lately (both of which I understand
to be a particular species of marbles much prized by the youth of this
town), made use of this remarkable expression: `How should you like to
have another father?' I shall prove to you, gentlemen, that about a year
ago, Pickwick suddenly began to absent himself from home, during long intervals,
as if with the intention of gradually breaking off from my client; but
I shall show you also, that his resolution was not at that time sufficiently
strong, or that his better feelings conquered, if better feelings he has,
or that the charms and accomplishments of my client prevailed against his
unmanly intentions; by proving to you, that on one occasion, when he returned
from the country, he distinctly and in terms, offered her marriage: previously
however, taking special care that there should be no witness to their solemn
contract; and I am in a situation to prove to you, on the testimony of
three of his own friends,--most unwilling witnesses, gentlemen--most unwilling
witnesses--that on that morning he was discovered by them holding the plaintiff
in his arms, and soothing her agitation by his caresses and endearments."

<P>A visible impression was produced upon the auditors by this part of
the learned serjeant's address. Drawing forth two very small scraps of
paper, he proceeded:

<P>"And now, gentlemen, but one word more. Two letters have passed between
these parties, letters which are admitted to be in the handwriting of the
defendant, and which speak volumes indeed. These letters, too, bespeak
the character of the man. They are not open, fervent, eloquent epistles,
breathing nothing but the language of affectionate attachment. They are
covert, sly, underhanded communications, but, fortunately, far more conclusive
than if couched in the most glowing language and the most poetic imagery--letters
that must be viewed with a cautious and suspicious eye--letters that were
evidently intended at the time, by Pickwick, to mislead and delude any
third parties into whose hands they might fall. Let me read the first:--`Garraway's,
twelve o'clock. Dear Mrs. B.--Chops and Tomato sauce. Yours, P<FONT SIZE=-1>ICKWICK</FONT>.'
Gentlemen, what does this mean? Chops and Tomato sauce! Yours, Pickwick!
Chops! Gracious heavens! and Tomato sauce! Gentlemen, is the happiness
of a sensitive and confiding female to be trifled away, by such shallow
artifices as these? The next has no date whatever, which in itself is suspicious.
`Dear Mrs. B., I shall not be at home till to-morrow. Slow coach.' And
then follows this very remarkable expression. `Don't trouble yourself about
the warming-pan.' The warming-pan! Why, gentlemen, who <I>does</I> trouble
himself about a warming-pan? When was the peace of mind of man or woman
broken or disturbed by a warming-pan, which is in itself a harmless, a
useful, and I will add, gentlemen, a comforting article of domestic furniture?
Why is Mrs. Bardell so earnestly entreated not to agitate herself about
this warming-pan, unless (as is no doubt the case) it is a mere cover for
hidden fire--a mere substitute for some endearing word or promise, agreeably
to a preconcerted system of correspondence, artfully contrived by Pickwick
with a view to his contemplated desertion, and which I am not in a condition
to explain? And what does this allusion to the slow coach mean? For aught
I know, it may be a reference to Pickwick himself, who has most unquestionably
been a criminally slow coach during the whole of this transaction, but
whose speed will now be very unexpectedly accelerated, and whose wheels,
gentlemen, as he will find to his cost, will very soon be greased by you!"

<P>Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz paused in this place, to see whether the jury smiled
at his joke; but as nobody took it but the greengrocer, whose sensitiveness
on the subject was very probably occasioned by his having subjected a chaise-cart
to the process in question on that identical morning, the learned serjeant
considered it advisable to undergo a slight relapse into the dismals before
he concluded.

<P>"But enough of this, gentlemen," said Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz, "it is difficult
to smile with an aching heart; it is ill jesting when our deepest sympathies
are awakened. My client's hopes and prospects are ruined, and it is no
figure of speech to say that her occupation is gone indeed. The bill is
down--but there is no tenant. Eligible single gentlemen pass and repass--but
there is no invitation for them to inquire within or without. All is gloom
and silence in the house; even the voice of the child is hushed; his infant
sports are disregarded when his mother weeps; his `alley tors' and his
`commoneys' are alike neglected; he forgets the long familiar cry of `knuckle
down,' and at tip-cheese, or odd and even, his hand is out. But Pickwick,
gentlemen, Pickwick, the ruthless destroyer of this domestic oasis in the
desert of Goswell Street--Pickwick, who has choked up the well, and thrown
ashes on the sward--Pickwick, who comes before you to-day with his heartless
Tomato sauce and warming-pans--Pickwick still rears his head with unblushing
effrontery, and gazes without a sigh on the ruin he has made. Damages,
gentlemen--heavy damages--is the only punishment with which you can visit
him; the only recompense you can award to my client. And for those damages
she now appeals to an enlightened, a high-minded, a right-feeling, a conscientious,
a dispassionate, a sympathising, a contemplative jury of her civilised
countrymen." With this beautiful peroration, Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz sat down,
and Mr. Justice Stareleigh woke up.

<P>"Call Elizabeth Cluppins," said Serjeant Buzfuz, rising a minute afterwards,
with renewed vigour.

<P>The nearest usher called for Elizabeth Tuppins; another one, at a little
distance off, demanded Elizabeth Jupkins; and a third rushed in a breathless
state into King Street, and screamed for Elizabeth Muffins till he was
hoarse.

<P>Meanwhile Mrs. Cluppins, with the combined assistance of Mrs. Bardell,
Mrs. Sanders, Mr. Dodson, and Mr. Fogg, was hoisted into the witness-box;
and when she was safely perched on the top step, Mrs. Bardell stood on
the bottom one, with the pocket-handkerchief and pattens in one hand, and
a glass bottle that might hold about a quarter of a pint of smelling salts
in the other, ready for any emergency. Mrs. Sanders, whose eyes were intently
fixed on the judge's face, planted herself close by, with the large umbrella:
keeping her right thumb pressed on the spring with an earnest countenance,
as if she were fully prepared to put it up at a moment's notice.

<P>"Mrs. Cluppins," said Serjeant Buzfuz "pray compose yourself, ma'am."
Of course, directly Mrs. Cluppins was desired to compose herself she sobbed
with increased vehemence, and gave divers alarming manifestations of an
approaching fainting fit, or, as she afterwards said, of her feelings being
too many for her.

<P>"Do you recollect, Mrs. Cluppins?" said Serjeant Buzfuz, after a few
unimportant questions, "do you recollect being in Mrs. Bardell's back one
pair of stairs, on one particular morning in July last, when she was dusting
Pickwick's apartment?"

<P>"Yes, my Lord and Jury, I do," replied Mrs. Cluppins.

<P>"Mr. Pickwick's sitting-room was the first-floor front, I believe?"

<P>"Yes, it were, sir," replied Mrs. Cluppins.

<P>"What were you doing in the back room, ma'am?" inquired the little judge.

<P>"My Lord and Jury," said Mrs. Cluppins, with interesting agitation,
"I will not deceive you."

<P>"You had better not, ma'am," said the little judge.

<P>"I was there," resumed Mrs. Cluppins, "unbeknown to Mrs. Bardell; I
had been out with a little basket, gentlemen, to buy three pound of red
kidney purtaties, which was three pound tuppence ha'penny, when I see Mrs.
Bardell's street door on the jar."

<P>"On the what?" exclaimed the little judge.

<P>"Partly open, my Lord," said Serjeant Snubbin.

<P>"She <I>said</I> on the jar," said the little judge, with a cunning
look.

<P>"It's all the same, my Lord,' said Serjeant Snubbin. The little judge
looked doubtful, and said he'd make a note of it. Mrs. Cluppins then resumed:

<P>"I walked in, gentlemen, just to say good mornin', and went, in a permiscuous
manner, up-stairs, and into the back room. Gentlemen, there was the sound
of voices in the front room, and--"

<P>"And you listened, I believe, Mrs. Cluppins?" said Serjeant Buzfuz.

<P>"Beggin' your pardon, sir," replied Mrs. Cluppins, in a majestic manner,
"I would scorn the haction. The voices was very loud, sir, and forced themselves
upon my ear."

<P>"Well, Mrs. Cluppins, you were not listening, but you heard the voices.
Was one of those voices, Pickwick's?"

<P>"Yes, it were, sir."

<P>And Mrs. Cluppins, after distinctly stating that Mr. Pickwick addressed
himself to Mrs. Bardell, repeated, by slow degrees, and by dint of many
questions, the conversation with which our readers are already acquainted.

<P>The jury looked suspicious, and Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz smiled and sat down.
They looked positively awful when Serjeant Snubbin intimated that he should
not cross-examine the witness, for Mr. Pickwick wished it to be distinctly
stated that it was due to her to say, that her account was in substance
correct.

<P>Mrs. Cluppins having once broken the ice, thought it a favourable opportunity
for entering into a short dissertation on her own domestic affairs; so,
she straightway proceeded to inform the court that she was the mother of
eight children at that present speaking, and that she entertained confident
expectations of presenting Mr. Cluppins with a ninth, somewhere about that
day six months. At this interesting point, the little judge interposed
most irascibly; and the effect of the interposition was, that both the
worthy lady and Mrs. Sanders were politely taken out of court, under the
escort of Mr. Jackson, without further parley.

<P>"Nathaniel Winkle!" said Mr. Skimpin.

<P>"Here!" replied a feeble voice. Mr. Winkle entered the witness box,
and having been duly sworn, bowed to the judge with considerable deference.

<P>"Don't look at me, sir," said the judge, sharply, in acknowledgment
of the salute; "look at the jury."

<P>Mr. Winkle obeyed the mandate, and looked at the place where he thought
it most probable the jury might be; for seeing anything in his then state
of intellectual complication was wholly out of the question.

<P>Mr. Winkle was then examined by Mr. Skimpin, who, being a promising
young man of two or three and forty, was of course anxious to confuse a
witness who was notoriously predisposed in favour of the other side, as
much as he could.

<P>"Now, sir," said Mr. Skimpin, "have the goodness to let his Lordship
and the jury know what your name is, will you?" and Mr. Skimpin inclined
his head on one side to listen with great sharpness to the answer, and
glanced at the jury meanwhile, as if to imply that he rather expected Mr.
Winkle's natural taste for perjury would induce him to give some name which
did not belong to him.

<P>"Winkle," replied the witness.

<P>"What's your Christian name, sir?" angrily inquired the little judge.

<P>"Nathaniel, sir."

<P>"Daniel,--any other name?"

<P>"Nathaniel, sir--my Lord, I mean."

<P>"Nathaniel Daniel, or Daniel Nathaniel?"

<P>"No, my Lord, only Nathaniel; not Daniel at all."

<P>"What did you tell me it was Daniel for, then, sir?" inquired the judge.

<P>"I didn't, my Lord," replied Mr. Winkle.

<P>"You did, sir," replied the judge, with a severe frown.

<P>"How could I have got Daniel on my notes, unless you told me so, sir?"

<P>This argument was, of course, unanswerable.

<P>"Mr. Winkle has rather a short memory, my Lord," interposed Mr. Skimpin,
with another glance at the jury. "We shall find means to refresh it before
we have quite done with him, I daresay."

<P>"You had better be careful, sir," said the little judge, with a sinister
look at the witness.

<P>Poor Mr. Winkle bowed, and endeavoured to feign an easiness of manner,
which, in his then state of confusion, gave him rather the air of a disconcerted
pickpocket.

<P>"Now, Mr. Winkle," said Mr. Skimpin, "attend to me, if you please, sir;
and let me recommend you, for your own sake, to bear in mind his Lordship's
injunction to be careful. I believe you are a particular friend of Pickwick,
the defendant, are you not?"

<P>"I have known Mr. Pickwick now, as well as I recollect at this moment,
nearly--"

<P>"Pray, Mr. Winkle, do not evade the question. Are you, or are you not,
a particular friend of the defendant's?"

<P>"I was just about to say, that--"

<P>"Will you, or will you not, answer my question, sir?"

<P>"If you don't answer the question you'll be committed, sir," interposed
the little judge, looking over his note-book.

<P>"Come, sir," said Mr. Skimpin, "yes or no, if you please."

<P>"Yes, I am," replied Mr. Winkle.

<P>"Yes, you are. And why couldn't you say that at once, sir? Perhaps you
know the plaintiff, too? Eh, Mr. Winkle?"

<P>"I don't know her; I've seen her."

<P>"Oh, you don't know her, but you've seen her? Now, have the goodness
to tell the gentlemen of the jury what you mean by <I>that</I>, Mr. Winkle."

<P>"I mean that I am not intimate with her, but I have seen her when I
went to call on Mr. Pickwick in Goswell Street."

<P>"How often have you seen her, sir?"

<P>"How often?"

<P>"Yes, Mr. Winkle, how often? I'll repeat the question for you a dozen
times, if you require it, sir." And the learned gentleman, with a firm
and steady frown, placed his hands on his hips, and smiled suspiciously
at the jury.

<P>On this question there arose the edifying brow-beating, customary on
such points. First of all, Mr. Winkle said it was quite impossible for
him to say how many times he had seen Mrs. Bardell. Then he was asked if
he had seen her twenty times, to which he replied, "Certainly,--more than
that." Then he was asked whether he hadn't seen her a hundred times--whether
he couldn't swear that he had seen her more than fifty times--whether he
didn't know that he had seen her at least seventy-five times--and so forth;
the satisfactory conclusion which was arrived at, at last, being, that
he had better take care of himself, and mind what he was about. The witness
having been by these means reduced to the requisite ebb of nervous perplexity,
the examination was continued as follows:

<P>"Pray, Mr. Winkle, do you remember calling on the defendant Pickwick
at these apartments in the plaintiff's house in Goswell Street, on one
particular morning, in the month of July last?"

<P>"Yes, I do."

<P>"Were you accompanied on that occasion by a friend of the name of Tupman,
and another of the name of Snodgrass?"

<P>"Yes, I was."

<P>"Are they here?"

<P>"Yes, they are," replied Mr. Winkle, looking very earnestly towards
the spot where his friends were stationed.

<P>"Pray attend to me, Mr. Winkle, and never mind your friends," said Mr.
Skimpin, with another expressive look at the jury. "They must tell their
stories without any previous consultation with you, if none has yet taken
place (another look at the jury). Now, sir, tell the gentlemen of the jury
what you saw on entering the defendant's room, on this particular morning.
Come; out with it, sir; we must have it, sooner or later."

<P>"The defendant, Mr. Pickwick, was holding the plaintiff in his arms,
with his hands clasping her waist," replied Mr. Winkle with natural hesitation,
"and the plaintiff appeared to have fainted away."

<P>"Did you hear the defendant say anything?"

<P>"I heard him call Mrs. Bardell a good creature, and I heard him ask
her to compose herself, for what a situation it was, if anybody should
come, or words to that effect."

<P>"Now, Mr. Winkle, I have only one more question to ask you, and I beg
you to bear in mind his lordship's caution. Will you undertake to swear
that Pickwick, the defendant, did not say on the occasion in question,
`My dear Mrs. Bardell, you're a good creature; compose yourself to this
situation, for to this situation you must come,' or words to <I>that</I>
effect?"

<P>"I--I didn't understand him so, certainly," said Mr. Winkle, astounded
at this ingenious dove-tailing of the few words he had heard, "I was on
the staircase, and couldn't hear distinctly; the impression on my mind
is--"

<P>"The gentlemen of the jury want none of the impressions on your mind,
Mr. Winkle, which I fear would be of little service to honest, straightforward
men," interposed Mr. Skimpin. "You were on the staircase, and didn't distinctly
hear; but you will not swear that Pickwick did not make use of the expressions
I have quoted? Do I understand that?"

<P>"No, I will not," replied Mr. Winkle; and down sat Mr. Skimpin with
a triumphant countenance.

<P>Mr. Pickwick's case had not gone off in so particularly happy a manner,
up to this point, that it could very well afford to have any additional
suspicion cast upon it. But as it could afford to be placed in a rather
better light, if possible, Mr. Phunky rose for the purpose of getting something
important out of Mr. Winkle in cross-examination. Whether he did get anything
important out of him, will immediately appear.

<P>"I believe, Mr. Winkle," said Mr. Phunky, "that Mr. Pickwick is not
a young man?"

<P>"Oh no," replied Mr. Winkle, "old enough to be my father."

<P>"You have told my learned friend that you have known Mr. Pickwick a
long time. Had you ever any reason to suppose or believe that he was about
to be married?"

<P>"Oh no; certainly not;" replied Mr. Winkle with so much eagerness, that
Mr. Phunky ought to have got him out of the box with all possible dispatch.
Lawyers hold that there are two kinds of particularly bad witnesses: a
reluctant witness, and a too-willing witness; it was Mr. Winkle's fate
to figure in both characters.

<P>"I will even go further than this, Mr. Winkle," continued Mr. Phunky
in a most smooth and complacent manner. "Did you ever see anything in Mr.
Pickwick's manner and conduct towards the opposite sex, to induce you to
believe that he ever contemplated matrimony of late years, in any case?"

<P>"Oh no; certainly not," replied Mr. Winkle.

<P>"Has his behaviour, when females have been in the case, always been
that of a man, who, having attained a pretty advanced period of life, content
with his own occupations and amusements, treats them only as a father might
his daughters?"

<P>"Not the least doubt of it," replied Mr. Winkle, in the fulness of his
heart. "That is--yes--oh yes--certainly."

<P>"You have never known anything in his behaviour towards Mrs. Bardell,
or any other female, in the least degree suspicious?" said Mr. Phunky,
preparing to sit down; for Serjeant Snubbin was winking at him.

<P>"N--n--no," replied Mr. Winkle, "except on one trifling occasion, which,
I have no doubt, might be easily explained."

<P>Now, if the unfortunate Mr. Phunky had sat down when Serjeant Snubbin
winked at him, or if Serjeant Buzfuz had stopped this irregular cross-examination
at the outset (which he knew better than to do; observing Mr. Winkle's
anxiety, and well knowing it would, in all probability, lead to something
serviceable to him), this unfortunate admission would not have been elicited.
The moment the words fell from Mr. Winkle's lips, Mr. Phunky sat down,
and Serjeant Snubbin rather hastily told him he might leave the box, which
Mr. Winkle prepared to do with great readiness, when Serjeant Buzfuz stopped
him.

<P>"Stay, Mr. Winkle, stay!" said Serjeant Buzfuz, "will your lordship
have the goodness to ask him, what this one instance of suspicious behaviour
towards females on the part of this gentleman, who is old enough to be
his father, was?"

<P>"You hear what the learned counsel says, sir," observed the judge, turning
to the miserable and agonised Mr. Winkle, "Describe the occasion to which
you refer."

<P>"My lord," said Mr. Winkle, trembling with anxiety, "I--I'd rather not."

<P>"Perhaps so," said the little judge; "but you must."

<P>Amid the profound silence of the whole court, Mr. Winkle faltered out,
that the trifling circumstance of suspicion was Mr. Pickwick's being found
in a lady's sleeping apartment at midnight; which had terminated, he believed,
in the breaking off of the projected marriage of the lady in question,
and had led, he knew, to the whole party being forcibly carried before
George Nupkins, Esq., magistrate and justice of the peace, for the borough
of Ipswich!

<P>"You may leave the box, sir," said Serjeant Snubbin. Mr. Winkle <I>did</I>
leave the box, and rushed with delirious haste to the George and Vulture,
where he was discovered some hours after, by the waiter, groaning in a
hollow and dismal manner, with his head buried beneath the sofa cushions.

<P>Tracy Tupman, and Augustus Snodgrass, were severally called into the
box; both corroborated the testimony of their unhappy friend; and each
was driven to the verge of desperation by excessive badgering.

<P>Susannah Sanders was then called, and examined by Serjeant Buzfuz, and
cross-examined by Serjeant Snubbin. Had always said and believed that Pickwick
would marry Mrs. Bardell; knew that Mrs. Bardell's being engaged to Pickwick
was the current topic of conversation in the neighbourhood, after the fainting
in July; had been told it herself by Mrs. Mudberry which kept a mangle,
and Mrs. Bunkin which clear-starched, but did not see either Mrs. Mudberry
or Mrs. Bunkin in court. Had heard Pickwick ask the little boy how he should
like to have another father. Did not know that Mrs. Bardell was at that
time keeping company with the baker, but did know that the baker was then
a single man and is now married. Couldn't swear that Mrs. Bardell was not
very fond of the baker, but should think that the baker was not very fond
of Mrs. Bardell, or he wouldn't have married somebody else. Thought Mrs.
Bardell fainted away on the morning in July, because Pickwick asked her
to name the day; knew that she (witness) fainted away stone dead when Mr.
Sanders asked <I>her</I> to name the day, and believed that everybody as
called herself a lady would do the same, under similar circumstances. Heard
Pickwick ask the boy the question about the marbles, but upon her oath
did not know the difference between an alley tor and a commoney.

<P>By the C<FONT SIZE=-1>OURT</FONT>.--During the period of her keeping
company with Mr. Sanders, had received love letters, like other ladies.
In the course of their correspondence Mr. Sanders had often called her
a "duck," but never "chops," nor yet "tomato sauce." He was particularly
fond of ducks. Perhaps if he had been as fond of chops and tomato sauce,
he might have called her that, as a term of affection.

<P>Serjeant Buzfuz now rose with more importance than he had yet exhibited,
if that were possible, and vociferated: "Call Samuel Weller."

<P>It was quite unnecessary to call Samuel Weller; for Samuel Weller stepped
briskly into the box the instant his name was pronounced; and placing his
hat on the floor, and his arms on the rail, took a bird's-eye view of the
bar, and a comprehensive survey of the bench, with a remarkably cheerful
and lively aspect.

<P>"What's your name, sir?" inquired the judge.

<P>"Sam Weller, my lord," replied that gentleman.

<P>"Do you spell it with a `V' or a `W'?" inquired the judge.

<P>"That depends upon the taste and fancy of the speller, my lord," replied
Sam; "I never had occasion to spell it more than once or twice in my life,
but I spells it with a `V.'"

<P>Here a voice in the gallery exclaimed aloud, "Quite right too, Samivel,
quite right. Put it down a we, my lord, put it down a we."

<P>"Who is that, who dares to address the court?" said the little judge,
looking up. "Usher."

<P>"Yes, my lord."

<P>"Bring that person here instantly."

<P>"Yes, my lord."

<P>But as the usher didn't find the person, he didn't bring him; and, after
a great commotion, all the people who had got up to look for the culprit,
sat down again. The little judge turned to the witness as soon as his indignation
would allow him to speak, and said,

<P>"Do you know who that was, sir?"

<P>"I rayther suspect it was my father, my lord," replied Sam.

<P>"Do you see him here now?" said the judge.

<P>"No, I don't, my lord," replied Sam, staring right up into the lantern
in the roof of the court.

<P>"If you could have pointed him out, I would have committed him instantly,"
said the judge.

<P>Sam bowed his acknowledgments and turned, with unimpaired cheerfulness
of countenance, towards Serjeant Buzfuz.

<P>"Now, Mr. Weller," said Serjeant Buzfuz.

<P>"Now, sir," replied Sam.

<P>"I believe you are in the service of Mr. Pickwick, the defendant in
this case. Speak up, if you please, Mr. Weller."

<P>"I mean to speak up, sir," replied Sam; "I am in the service o' that
'ere gen'l'man, and a wery good service it is."

<P>"Little to do, and plenty to get, I suppose?" said Serjeant Buzfuz,
with jocularity.

<P>"Oh, quite enough to get, sir, as the soldier said ven they ordered
him three hundred and fifty lashes," replied Sam.

<P>"You must not tell us what the soldier, or any other man, said, sir,"
interposed the judge; "it's not evidence."

<P>"Wery good, my lord," replied Sam.

<P>"Do you recollect anything particular happening on the morning when
you were first engaged by the defendant; eh, Mr. Weller?" said Serjeant
Buzfuz.

<P>"Yes I do, sir," replied Sam.

<P>"Have the goodness to tell the jury what it was."

<P>"I had a reg'lar new fit out o' clothes that mornin', gen'l'men of the
jury," said Sam, "and that was a wery partickler and uncommon circumstance
vith me in those days."

<P>Hereupon there was a general laugh; and the little judge, looking with
an angry countenance over his desk, said, "You had better be careful, sir."

<P>"So Mr. Pickwick said at the time, my lord," replied Sam; "and I was
wery careful o' that 'ere suit o' clothes; wery careful indeed, my lord."

<P>The judge looked sternly at Sam for full two minutes, but Sam's features
were so perfectly calm and serene that the judge said nothing, and motioned
Serjeant Buzfuz to proceed.

<P>"Do you mean to tell me, Mr. Weller," said Serjeant Buzfuz, folding
his arms emphatically, and turning half-round to the jury, as if in mute
assurance that he would bother the witness yet: "Do you mean to tell me,
Mr. Weller, that you saw nothing of this fainting on the part of the plaintiff
in the arms of the defendant, which you have heard described by the witnesses?"

<P>"Certainly not," replied Sam. "I was in the passage 'till they called
me up, and then the old lady was not there."

<P>"Now, attend, Mr. Weller," said Serjeant Buzfuz, dipping a large pen
into the inkstand before him, for the purpose of frightening Sam with a
show of taking down his answer. "You were in the passage, and yet saw nothing
of what was going forward. Have you a pair of eyes, Mr. Weller?"

<P>"Yes, I have a pair of eyes," replied Sam, "and that's just it. If they
wos a pair o' patent double million magnifyin' gas microscopes of hextra
power, p'raps I might be able to see through a flight o' stairs and a deal
door; but bein' only eyes, you see, my wision's limited."

<P>At this answer, which was delivered without the slightest appearance
of irritation, and with the most complete simplicity and equanimity of
manner, the spectators tittered, the little judge smiled, and Serjeant
Buzfuz looked particularly foolish. After a short consultation with Dodson
and Fogg, the learned Serjeant again turned towards Sam, and said, with
a painful effort to conceal his vexation, "Now, Mr. Weller, I'll ask you
a question on another point, if you please."

<P>"If you please, sir," rejoined Sam, with the utmost good-humour.

<P>"Do you remember going up to Mrs. Bardell's house, one night in November
last?"

<P>"Oh yes, very well."

<P>"Oh, you <I>do</I> remember that, Mr. Weller," said Serjeant Buzfuz,
recovering his spirits; "I thought we should get at something at last."

<P>"I rayther thought that, too, sir," replied Sam; and at this the spectators
tittered again.

<P>"Well; I suppose you went up to have a little talk about this trial--eh,
Mr. Weller?" said Serjeant Buzfuz, looking knowingly at the jury.

<P>"I went up to pay the rent; but we <I>did</I> get a talkin' about the
trial," replied Sam.

<P>"Oh, you did get a talking about the trial," said Serjeant Buzfuz, brightening
up with the anticipation of some important discovery. "Now what passed
about the trial; will you have the goodness to tell us, Mr. Weller?"

<P>"Vith all the pleasure in life, sir," replied Sam. "Arter a few unimportant
obserwations from the two wirtuous females as has been examined here to-day,
the ladies gets into a very great state o' admiration at the honourable
conduct of Mr. Dodson and Fogg--them two gen'l'men as is settin' near you
now." This, of course, drew general attention to Dodson and Fogg, who looked
as virtuous as possible.

<P>"The attorneys for the plaintiff," said Mr. Serjeant Buzfuz. "Well!
They spoke in high praise of the honourable conduct of Messrs. Dodson and
Fogg, the attorneys for the plaintiff, did they?"

<P>"Yes," said Sam, "they said what a wery gen'rous thing it was o' them
to have taken up the case on spec, and to charge nothing at all for costs,
unless they got 'em out of Mr. Pickwick."

<P>At this very unexpected reply, the spectators tittered again, and Dodson
and Fogg, turning very red, leant over to Serjeant Buzfuz, and in a hurried
manner whispered something in his ear.

<P>"You are quite right," said Serjeant Buzfuz aloud, with affected composure.
"It's perfectly useless, my lord, attempting to get at any evidence through
the impenetrable stupidity of this witness. I will not trouble the court
by asking him any more questions. Stand down, sir."

<P>"Would any other gen'l'man like to ask me anythin'?" inquired Sam, taking
up his hat, and looking round most deliberately.

<P>"Not I, Mr. Weller, thank you," said Serjeant Snubbin, laughing.

<P>"You may go down, sir," said Serjeant Buzfuz, waving his hand impatiently.
Sam went down accordingly, after doing Messrs. Dodson and Fogg's case as
much harm as he conveniently could, and saying just as little respecting
Mr. Pickwick as might be, which was precisely the object he had had in
view all along.

<P>"I have no objection to admit, my lord," said Serjeant Snubbin, "if
it will save the examination of another witness, that Mr. Pickwick has
retired from business, and is a gentleman of considerable independent property."

<P>"Very well," said Serjeant Buzfuz, putting in the two letters to be
read, "Then that's my case, my lord."

<P>Serjeant Snubbin then addressed the jury on behalf of the defendant;
and a very long and a very emphatic address he delivered, in which he bestowed
the highest possible eulogiums on the conduct and character of Mr. Pickwick;
but inasmuch as our readers are far better able to form a correct estimate
of that gentleman's merits and deserts, than Serjeant Snubbin could possibly
be, we do not feel called upon to enter at any length into the learned
gentleman's observations. He attempted to show that the letters which had
been exhibited, merely related to Mr. Pickwick's dinner, or to the preparations
for receiving him in his apartments on his return from some country excursion.
It is sufficient to add in general terms, that he did the best he could
for Mr. Pickwick; and the best, as everybody knows, on the infallible authority
of the old adage, could do no more.

<P>Mr. Justice Stareleigh summed up, in the old-established and most approved
form. He read as much of his notes to the jury as he could decipher on
so short a notice, and made running comments on the evidence as he went
along. If Mrs. Bardell were right, it was perfectly clear that Mr. Pickwick
was wrong, and if they thought the evidence of Mrs. Cluppins worthy of
credence they would believe it, and, if they didn't, why they wouldn't.
If they were satisfied that a breach of promise of marriage had been committed,
they would find for the plaintiff with such damages as they thought proper;
and if, on the other hand, it appeared to them that no promise of marriage
had ever been given, they would find for the defendant with no damages
at all. The jury then retired to their private room to talk the matter
over, and the judge retired to <I>his</I> private room, to refresh himself
with a mutton chop and a glass of sherry.

<P>An anxious quarter of an hour elapsed; the jury came back; the judge
was fetched in. Mr. Pickwick put on his spectacles, and gazed at the foreman
with an agitated countenance and a quickly beating heart.

<P>"Gentlemen," said the individual in black, "are you all agreed upon
your verdict?"

<P>"We are," replied the foreman.

<P>"Do you find for the plaintiff, gentlemen, or for the defendant?"

<P>"For the plaintiff."

<P>"With what damages, gentlemen?"

<P>"Seven hundred and fifty pounds."

<P>Mr. Pickwick took off his spectacles, carefully wiped the glasses, folded
them into their case, and put them in his pocket; then having drawn on
his gloves with great nicety, and stared at the foreman all the while,
he mechanically followed Mr. Perker and the blue bag out of court.

<P>They stopped in a side room while Perker paid the court fees; and here,
Mr. Pickwick was joined by his friends. Here, too, he encountered Messrs.
Dodson and Fogg, rubbing their hands with every token of outward satisfaction.

<P>"Well, gentlemen," said Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"Well, sir," said Dodson: for self and partner.

<P>"You imagine you'll get your costs, don't you, gentlemen?" said Mr.
Pickwick.

<P>Fogg said they thought it rather probable. Dodson smiled, and said they'd
try.

<P>"You may try, and try, and try again, Messrs. Dodson and Fogg," said
Mr. Pickwick vehemently, "but not one farthing of costs or damages do you
ever get from me, if I spend the rest of my existence in a debtor's prison."

<P>"Ha, ha!" laughed Dodson. "You'll think better of that, before next
term, Mr. Pickwick."

<P>"He, he, he! We'll soon see about that, Mr. Pickwick," grinned Fogg.

<P>Speechless with indignation, Mr. Pickwick allowed himself to be led
by his solicitor and friends to the door, and there assisted into a hackney-coach,
which had been fetched for the purpose, by the ever watchful Sam Weller.

<P>Sam had put up the steps, and was preparing to jump upon the box, when
he felt himself gently touched on the shoulder; and looking round, his
father stood before him. The old gentleman's countenance wore a mournful
expression, as he shook his head gravely, and said, in warning accents:

<P>"I know'd what'ud come o' this here mode o' doin' bisness. Oh Sammy,
Sammy, vy worn't there a alleybi!"
