A ROMANTIC ADVENTURE WITH A MIDDLE-AGED LADY IN YELLOW CURL PAPERS</FONT>.</CENTER>


<P>"T<FONT SIZE=-1>HAT</FONT> 'ere your governor's luggage, Sammy?" inquired
Mr. Weller of his affectionate son, as he entered the yard of the Bull
inn, Whitechapel, with a travelling bag and a small portmanteau.

<P>"You might ha' made a worser guess than that, old feller," replied Mr.
Weller the younger, setting down his burden in the yard, and sitting himself
down upon it afterwards. "The Governor hisself'll be down here presently."

<P>"He's a cabbin' it, I suppose?" said the father.

<P>"Yes, he's a havin' two mile o' danger at eight-pence," responded the
son. "How's mother-in-law this mornin'?"

<P>"Queer, Sammy, queer," replied the elder Mr. Weller, with impressive
gravity. "She's been gettin' rayther in the Methodistical order lately,
Sammy; and she is uncommon pious, to be sure. She's too good a creetur
for me, Sammy. I feel I don't deserve her."

<P>"Ah," said Mr. Samuel, "that's wery self-denyin' o' you."

<P>"Wery," replied his parent, with a sigh. "She's got hold o' some inwention
for grown-up people being born again, Sammy; the new birth, I thinks they
calls it. I should wery much like to see that system in haction, Sammy.
I should wery much like to see your mother-in-law born again. Wouldn't
I put her out to nurse!"

<P>"What do you think them women does t'other day," continued Mr. Weller,
after a short pause, during which he had significantly struck the side
of his nose with his fore-finger some half-dozen times. "What do you think
they does, t'other day, Sammy?"

<P>"Don't know," replied Sammy, "what?"

<P>"Goes and gets up a grand tea drinkin' for a feller they calls their
shepherd," said Mr. Weller. "I was a standing starin' in at the pictur
shop down at our place, when I sees a little bill about it; `tickets half-a-crown.
All applications to be made to the committee. Secretary, Mrs. Weller;'
and when I got home there was the committee a sittin' in our back parlour.
Fourteen women; I wish you could ha' heard 'em, Sammy. There they was,
a passin' resolutions, and wotin' supplies, and all sorts o' games. Well,
what with your mother-in-law a worrying me to go, and what with my looking
for'ard to seein' some queer starts if I did, I put my name down for a
ticket; at six o'clock on the Friday evenin' I dresses myself out wery
smart, and off I goes with the old 'ooman, and up we walks into a fust
floor where there was tea things for thirty, and a whole lot o' women as
begins whisperin' at one another, and lookin' at me, as if they'd never
seen a rayther stout gen'l'm'n of eight-and-fifty afore. Bye-and-bye, there
comes a great bustle down-stairs, and a lanky chap with a red nose and
a white neckcloth rushes up, and sings out, `Here's the shepherd a coming
to wisit his faithful flock'; and in comes a fat chap in black, vith a
great white face, a smilin' avay like clockwork. Such goin's on, Sammy!
`The kiss of peace,' says the shepherd; and then he kissed the women all
round, and ven he'd done, the man vith the red nose began. I was just a
thinkin' whether I hadn't better begin too--'specially as there was a wery
nice lady a sittin' next me--ven in comes the tea, and your mother-in-law,
as had been makin' the kettle bile down-stairs. At it they went, tooth
and nail. Such a precious loud hymn, Sammy, while the tea was a brewing;
such a grace, such eatin' and drinkin'! I wish you could ha' seen the shepherd
walkin' into the ham and muffins. I never see such a chap to eat and drink;
never. The red-nosed man warn't by no means the sort of person you'd like
to grub by contract, but he was nothin' to the shepherd. Well; arter the
tea was over, they sang another hymn, and then the shepherd began to preach:
and wery well he did it, considerin' how heavy them muffins must have lied
on his chest. Presently he pulls up, all of a sudden, and hollers out `Where
is the sinner; where is the mis'rable sinner?' Upon which, all the women
looked at me, and began to groan as if they was a dying. I thought it was
rather sing'ler, but hows'ever, I says nothing. Presently he pulls up again,
and lookin' wery hard at me, says, `Where is the sinner; where is the mis'rable
sinner?' and all the women groans again, ten times louder than afore. I
got rather wild at this, so I takes a step or two for'ard and says, `My
friend,' says I, `did you apply that 'ere obserwation to me?' 'Stead of
begging my pardon as any gen'l'm'n would ha' done, he got more abusive
than ever: called me a wessel, Sammy--a wessel of wrath--and all sorts
o' names. So my blood being reg'larly up, I first give him two or three
for himself, and then two or three more to hand over to the man with the
red nose, and walked off. I wish you could ha' heard how the women screamed,
Sammy, ven they picked up the shepherd from under the table--Hallo! here's
the governor, the size of life."

<P>As Mr. Weller spoke, Mr. Pickwick dismounted from a cab, and entered
the yard.

<P>"Fine mornin', sir," said Mr. Weller senior.

<P>"Beautiful indeed," replied Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"Beautiful indeed," echoed a red-haired man with an inquisitive nose
and spectacles, who had unpacked himself from a cab at the same moment
as Mr. Pickwick. "Going to Ipswich, sir?"

<P>"I am," replied Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"Extraordinary coincidence. So am I."

<P>Mr. Pickwick bowed.

<P>"Going outside?" said the red-haired man.

<P>Mr. Pickwick bowed again.

<P>"Bless my soul, how remarkable--I am going outside, too," said the red-haired
man: "we are positively going together." And the red-haired man, who was
an important-looking, sharp-nosed, mysterious-spoken personage, with a
bird-like habit of giving his head a jerk every time he said anything,
smiled as if he had made one of the strangest discoveries that ever fell
to the lot of human wisdom.

<P>"I am happy in the prospect of your company, sir," said Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"Ah," said the new-comer, "it's a good thing for both of us, isn't it?
Company, you see--company is--is--it's a very different thing from solitude--ain't
it?"

<P>"There's no denying that 'ere," said Mr. Weller, joining in the conversation,
with an affable smile. "That's what I call a self-evident proposition,
as the dog's-meat man said, when the housemaid told him he warn't a gentleman."

<P>"Ah," said the red-haired man, surveying Mr. Weller from head to foot
with a supercilious look. "Friend of yours, sir?"

<P>"Not exactly a friend," replied Mr. Pickwick in a low tone. "The fact
is, he is my servant, but I allow him to take a good many liberties; for,
between ourselves, I flatter myself he is an original, and I am rather
proud of him."

<P>"Ah," said the red-haired man, "that, you see, is a matter of taste.
I am not fond of anything original; I don't like it; don't see the necessity
for it. What's your name, sir?"

<P>"Here is my card, sir," replied Mr. Pickwick, much amused by the abruptness
of the question, and the singular manner of the stranger.

<P>"Ah," said the red-haired man, placing the card in his pocket-book,
"Pickwick; very good. I like to know a man's name, it saves so much trouble.
That's my card, sir, Magnus, you will perceive, sir--Magnus is my name.
It's rather a good name, I think, sir?"

<P>"A very good name, indeed," said Mr. Pickwick, wholly unable to repress
a smile.

<P>"Yes, I think it is," resumed Mr. Magnus. "There's a good name before
it, too, you will observe. Permit me, sir--if you hold the card a little
slanting, this way, you catch the light upon the up-stroke. There--Peter
Magnus--sounds well, I think, sir."

<P>"Very," said Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"Curious circumstance about those initials, sir," said Mr. Magnus. "You
will observe--P.M.--post meridian. In hasty notes to intimate acquaintance,
I sometimes sign myself `Afternoon.' It amuses my friends very much, Mr.
Pickwick."

<P>"It is calculated to afford them the highest gratification, I should
conceive," said Mr. Pickwick, rather envying the ease with which Mr. Magnus's
friends were entertained.

<P>"Now, gen'l'm'n," said the hostler, "coach is ready, if you please."

<P>"Is all my luggage in?" inquired Mr. Magnus.

<P>"All right, sir."

<P>"Is the red bag in?"

<P>"All right, sir."

<P>"And the striped bag?"

<P>"Fore boot, sir."

<P>"And the brown-paper parcel?"

<P>"Under the seat, sir."

<P>"And the leather hat-box?"

<P>"They're all in, sir."

<P>"Now, will you get up?" said Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"Excuse me," replied Magnus, standing on the wheel. "Excuse me, Mr.
Pickwick. I cannot consent to get up, in this state of uncertainty. I am
quite satisfied from that man's manner, that that leather hat-box is not
in."

<P>The solemn protestations of the hostler being wholly unavailing, the
leather hat-box was obliged to be raked up from the lowest depth of the
boot, to satisfy him that it had been safely packed; and after he had been
assured on this head, he felt a solemn presentiment, first, that the red
bag was mislaid, and next that the striped bag had been stolen, and then
that the brown-paper parcel "had come untied."

<P>At length when he had received ocular demonstration of the groundless
nature of each and every of these suspicions, he consented to climb up
to the roof of the coach, observing that now he had taken everything off
his mind, he felt quite comfortable and happy.

<P>"You're given to nervousness, an't you, sir?" inquired Mr. Weller senior,
eyeing the stranger askance, as he mounted to his place.

<P>"Yes; I always am rather, about these little matters," said the stranger,
"but I am all right now--quite right."

<P>"Well, that's a blessin'," said Mr. Weller. "Sammy, help your master
up to the box: t'other leg, sir, that's it; give us your hand, sir. Up
with you. You was a lighter weight when you was a boy, sir."

<P>"True enough, that, Mr. Weller," said the breathless Mr. Pickwick, good
humouredly, as he took his seat on the box beside him.

<P>"Jump up in front, Sammy," said Mr. Weller. "Now Villam, run 'em out.
Take care o' the archvay, gen'l'm'n. `Heads,' as the pieman says. That'll
do, Villam. Let 'em alone." And away went the coach up Whitechapel, to
the admiration of the whole population of that pretty-densely populated
quarter.

<P>"Not a very nice neighbourhood this, sir," said Sam, with a touch of
the hat, which always preceded his entering into conversation with his
master.

<P>"It is not indeed, Sam," replied Mr. Pickwick surveying the crowded
and filthy street through which they were passing.

<P>"It's a wery remarkable circumstance, sir," said Sam, "that poverty
and oysters always seems to go together."

<P>"I don't understand you, Sam," said Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"What I mean, sir," said Sam, "is, that the poorer a place is, the greater
call there seems to be for oysters. Look here, sir; here's a oyster stall
to every half-dozen houses. The street's lined vith 'em. Blessed if I don't
think that ven a man's wery poor, he rushes out of his lodgings, and eats
oysters in reg'lar desperation."

<P>"To be sure he does," said Mr. Weller senior; "and it's just the same
vith pickled salmon!"

<P>"Those are two very remarkable facts, which never occurred to me before,"
said Mr. Pickwick. "The very first place we stop at, I'll make a note of
them."

<P>By this time they had reached the turnpike at Mile End; a profound silence
prevailed until they had got two or three miles further on, when Mr. Weller
senior, turning suddenly to Mr. Pickwick, said:

<P>"Wery queer life is a pike-keeper's, sir."

<P>"A what?" said Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"A pike-keeper."

<P>"What do you mean by a pike-keeper?" inquired Mr. Peter Magnus.

<P>"The old 'un means a turnpike keeper, gen'l'm'n," observed Mr. Samuel
Weller, in explanation.

<P>"Oh," said Mr. Pickwick, "I see. Yes; very curious life. Very uncomfortable."

<P>"They're all on 'em men as has met vith some disappointment in life,"
said Mr. Weller senior.

<P>"Ay, ay?" said Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"Yes. Consequence of vich, they retires from the world, and shuts themselves
up in pikes; partly with the view of being solitary, and partly to rewenge
themselves on mankind, by takin' tolls."

<P>"Dear me," said Mr. Pickwick, "I never knew that before."

<P>"Fact, sir," said Mr. Weller; "if they was gen'l'm'n you'd call 'em
misanthropes, but as it is, they only takes to pikekeepin'."

<P>With such conversation, possessing the inestimable charm of blending
amusement with instruction, did Mr. Weller beguile the tediousness of the
journey, during the greater part of the day. Topics of conversation were
never wanting, for even when any pause occurred in Mr. Weller's loquacity,
it was abundantly supplied by the desire evinced by Mr. Magnus to make
himself acquainted with the whole of the personal history of his fellow-travellers,
and his loudly-expressed anxiety at every stage, respecting the safety
and well-being of the two bags, the leather hat-box, and the brown-paper
parcel.

<P>In the main street of Ipswich, on the left-hand side of the way, a short
distance after you have passed through the open space fronting the Town
Hall, stands an inn known far and wide by the appellation of The Great
White Horse, rendered the more conspicuous by a stone statue of some rampacious
animal with flowing mane and tail, distantly resembling an insane cart-horse,
which is elevated above the principal door. The Great White Horse is famous
in the neighbourhood, in the same degree as a prize ox, or county paper-chronicled
turnip, or unwieldy pig--for its enormous size. Never were such labyrinths
of uncarpeted passages, such clusters of mouldy, ill-lighted rooms, such
huge numbers of small dens for eating or sleeping in, beneath any one roof,
as are collected together between the four walls of the Great White Horse
at Ipswich.

<P>It was at the door of this overgrown tavern that the London coach stopped,
at the same hour every evening; and it was from this same London coach,
that Mr. Pickwick, Sam Weller, and Mr. Peter Magnus dismounted, on the
particular evening to which this chapter of our history bears reference.

<P>"Do you stop here, sir?" inquired Mr. Peter Magnus, when the striped
bag, and the red bag, and the brown-paper parcel, and the leather hat-box,
had all been deposited in the passage. "Do you stop here, sir?"

<P>"I do," said Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"Dear me," said Mr. Magnus, "I never knew anything like these extraordinary
coincidences. Why, I stop here too. I hope we dine together."

<P>"With pleasure," replied Mr. Pickwick. "I am not quite certain whether
I have any friends here or not, though. Is there any gentleman of the name
of Tupman here, waiter?"

<P>A corpulent man, with a fortnight's napkin under his arm, and coeval
stockings on his legs, slowly desisted from his occupation of staring down
the street, on this question being put to him by Mr. Pickwick; and, after
minutely inspecting that gentleman's appearance, from the crown of his
hat to the lowest button of his gaiters, replied emphatically:

<P>"No."

<P>"Nor any gentleman of the name of Snodgrass?" inquired Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"No!"

<P>"Nor Winkle?"

<P>"No."

<P>"My friends have not arrived to-day, sir," said Mr. Pickwick. "We will
dine alone, then. Shew us a private room, waiter."

<P>On this request being preferred, the corpulent man condescended to order
the boots to bring in the gentlemen's luggage; and preceding them down
a long dark passage, ushered them into a large badly-furnished apartment,
with a dirty grate, in which a small fire was making a wretched attempt
to be cheerful, but was fast sinking beneath the dispiriting influence
of the place. After the lapse of an hour, a bit of fish and a steak were
served up to the travellers, and when the dinner was cleared away, Mr.
Pickwick and Mr. Peter Magnus drew their chairs up to the fire, and having
ordered a bottle of the worst possible port wine, at the highest possible
price, for the good of the house, drank brandy and water for their own.

<P>Mr. Peter Magnus was naturally of a very communicative disposition,
and the brandy and water operated with wonderful effect in warming into
life the deepest hidden secrets of his bosom. After sundry accounts of
himself, his family, his connexions, his friends, his jokes, his business,
and his brothers (most talkative men have a great deal to say about their
brothers), Mr. Peter Magnus took a blue view of Mr. Pickwick through his
coloured spectacles for several minutes, and then said, with an air of
modesty:

<P>"And what do you think--what <I>do</I> you think, Mr. Pickwick--I have
come down here for?"

<P>"Upon my word," said Mr. Pickwick, "it is wholly impossible for me to
guess; on business, perhaps."

<P>"Partly right, sir," replied Mr. Peter Magnus, "but partly wrong, at
the same time: try again, Mr. Pickwick."

<P>"Really," said Mr. Pickwick, "I must throw myself on your mercy, to
tell me or not, as you may think best; for I should never guess, if I were
to try all night."

<P>"Why, then, he--he--he!" said Mr. Peter Magnus, with a bashful titter,
"what would you think, Mr. Pickwick, if I had come down here, to make a
proposal, sir, eh? He--he--he!"

<P>"Think! That you are very likely to succeed," replied Mr. Pickwick,
with one of his beaming smiles.

<P>"Ah!" said Mr. Magnus. "But do you really think so, Mr. Pickwick? Do
you, though?"

<P>"Certainly," said Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"No; but you're joking, though."

<P>"I am not, indeed."

<P>"Why, then," said Mr. Magnus, "to let you into a little secret, <I>I</I>
think so too. I don't mind telling you, Mr. Pickwick, although I'm dreadful
jealous by nature--horrid--that the lady is in this house." Here Mr. Magnus
took off his spectacles, on purpose to wink, and then put them on again.

<P>"That's what you were running out of the room for, before dinner, then,
so often," said Mr. Pickwick, archly.

<P>"Hush! Yes, you're right, that was it; not such a fool as to see her,
though."

<P>"No!"

<P>"No; wouldn't do, you know, after having just come off a journey. Wait
till to-morrow, sir; double the chance then. Mr. Pickwick, sir, there is
a suit of clothes in that bag, and a hat in that box, which I expect, in
the effect they will produce, will be invaluable to me, sir."

<P>"Indeed!" said Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"Yes; you must have observed my anxiety about them to-day. I do not
believe that such another suit of clothes, and such a hat, could be bought
for money, Mr. Pickwick."

<P>Mr. Pickwick congratulated the fortunate owner of the irresistible garments,
on their acquisition; and Mr. Peter Magnus remained for a few moments apparently
absorbed in contemplation.

<P>"She's a fine creature," said Mr. Magnus.

<P>"Is she?" said Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"Very," said Mr. Magnus, "very. She lives about twenty miles from here,
Mr. Pickwick. I heard she would be here to-night and all to-morrow forenoon,
and came down to seize the opportunity. I think an inn is a good sort of
a place to propose to a single woman in, Mr. Pickwick. She is more likely
to feel the loneliness of her situation in travelling, perhaps, than she
would be at home. What do you think, Mr. Pickwick?"

<P>"I think it very probable," replied that gentleman.

<P>"I beg your pardon, Mr. Pickwick," said Mr. Peter Magnus, "but I am
naturally rather curious; what may <I>you</I> have come down here for?"

<P>"On a far less pleasant errand, sir," replied Mr. Pickwick, the colour
mounting to his face at the recollection. "I have come down here, sir,
to expose the treachery and falsehood of an individual, upon whose truth
and honour I placed implicit reliance."

<P>"Dear me," said Mr. Peter Magnus, "that's very unpleasant. It is a lady,
I presume? Eh? ah! Sly, Mr. Pickwick, sly. Well, Mr. Pickwick, sir, I wouldn't
these, sir, very painful. Don't mind me, Mr. Pickwick, if you wish to give
vent to your feelings. I know what it is to be jilted, sir; I have endured
that sort of thing three or four times."

<P>"I am much obliged to you, for your condolence on what you presume to
be my melancholy case," said Mr. Pickwick, winding up his watch, and laying
it on the table, "but--"

<P>"No, no," said Mr. Peter Magnus, "not a word more: it's a painful subject.
I see, I see. What's the time, Mr. Pickwick?"

<P>"Past twelve."

<P>"Dear me, it's time to go to bed. It will never do, sitting here. I
shall be pale to-morrow, Mr. Pickwick."

<P>At the bare notion of such a calamity, Mr. Peter Magnus rang the bell
for the chamber-maid; and the striped bag, the red bag, the leathern hat-box,
and the brown-paper parcel, having been conveyed to his bed-room, he retired
in company with a japanned candlestick, to one side of the house, while
Mr. Pickwick, and another japanned candlestick, were conducted through
a multitude of tortuous windings, to another.

<P>"This is your room, sir," said the chamber-maid.

<P>"Very well," replied Mr. Pickwick, looking round him. It was a tolerably
large double-bedded room, with a fire; upon the whole, a more comfortable-looking
apartment than Mr. Pickwick's short experience of the accommodations of
the Great White Horse had led him to expect.

<P>"Nobody sleeps in the other bed, of course," said Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"Oh, no, sir."

<P>"Very good. Tell my servant to bring me up some hot water at half-past
eight in the morning, and that I shall not want him any more to-night."

<P>"Yes, sir." And bidding Mr. Pickwick good night, the chamber-maid retired,
and left him alone.

<P>Mr. Pickwick sat himself down in a chair before the fire, and fell into
a train of rambling meditations. First he thought of his friends, and wondered
when they would join him; then his mind reverted to Mrs. Martha Bardell;
and from that lady it wandered, by a natural process, to the dingy counting-house
of Dodson and Fogg. From Dodson and Fogg's it flew off at a tangent, to
the very centre of the history of the queer client; and then it came back
to the Great White Horse at Ipswich, with sufficient clearness to convince
Mr. Pickwick that he was falling asleep. So he roused himself, and began
to undress, when he recollected he had left his watch on the table down-stairs.

<P>Now, this watch was a special favourite with Mr. Pickwick, having been
carried about, beneath the shadow of his waistcoat, for a greater number
of years than we feel called upon to state at present. The possibility
of going to sleep, unless it were ticking gently beneath his pillow, or
in the watch-pocket over his head, had never entered Mr. Pickwick's brain.
So as it was pretty late now, and he was unwilling to ring his bell at
that hour of the night, he slipped on his coat, of which he had just divested
himself, and taking the japanned candlestick in his hand, walked quietly
down-stairs.

<P>The more stairs Mr. Pickwick went down, the more stairs there seemed
to be to descend, and again and again, when Mr. Pickwick got into some
narrow passage, and began to congratulate himself on having gained the
ground-floor, did another flight of stairs appear before his astonished
eyes. At last he reached a stone hall, which he remembered to have seen
when he entered the house. Passage after passage did he explore; room after
room did he peep into; at length, as he was on the point of giving up the
search in despair, he opened the door of the identical room in which he
had spent the evening, and beheld his missing property on the table.

<P>Mr. Pickwick seized the watch in triumph, and proceeded to re-trace
his steps to his bed-chamber. If his progress downward had been attended
with difficulties and uncertainty, his journey back was infinitely more
perplexing. Rows of doors, garnished with boots of every shape, make, and
size, branched off in every possible direction. A dozen times did he softly
turn the handle of some bed-room door which resembled his own, when a gruff
cry from within of "Who the devil's that?" or "What do you want here?"
caused him to steal away, on tiptoe, with a perfectly marvellous celerity.
He was reduced to the verge of despair, when an open door attracted his
attention. He peeped in. Right at last! There were the two beds, whose
situation he perfectly remembered, and the fire still burning. His candle,
not a long one when he first received it, had flickered away in the drafts
of air through which he had passed, and sank into the socket as he closed
the door after him. "No matter," said Mr. Pickwick, "I can undress myself
just as well by the light of the fire."

<P>The bedsteads stood one on each side of the door; and on the inner side
of each was a little path, terminating in a rush-bottomed chair, just wide
enough to admit of a person's getting into, or out of bed, on that side,
if he or she thought proper. Having carefully drawn the curtains of his
bed on the outside, Mr. Pickwick sat down on the rush-bottomed chair and
leisurely divested himself of his shoes and gaiters. He then took off and
folded up his coat, waistcoat, and neckcloth, and slowly drawing on his
tasselled night-cap, secured it firmly on his head, by tying beneath his
chin the strings which he always had attached to that article of dress.
It was at this moment that the absurdity of his recent bewilderment struck
upon his mind. Throwing himself back in the rush-bottomed chair, Mr. Pickwick
laughed to himself so heartily, that it would have been quite delightful
to any man of well-constituted mind to have watched the smiles that expanded
his amiable features as they shone forth from beneath the night-cap.

<P>"It is the best idea," said Mr. Pickwick to himself, smiling till he
almost cracked the night-cap strings: "It is the best idea, my losing myself
in this place, and wandering about those staircases, that I ever heard
of. Droll, droll, very droll." Here Mr. Pickwick smiled again, a broader
smile than before, and was about to continue the process of undressing,
in the best possible humour, when he was suddenly stopped by a most unexpected
interruption; to wit, the entrance into the room of some person with a
candle, who, after locking the door, advanced to the dressing table, and
set down the light upon it.

<P>The smile that played on Mr. Pickwick's features was instantaneously
lost in a look of the most unbounded and wonder-stricken surprise. The
person, whoever it was, had come in so suddenly and with so little noise,
that Mr. Pickwick had had no time to call out, or oppose their entrance.
Who could it be? A robber? Some evil-minded person who had seen him come
up-stairs with a handsome watch in his hand, perhaps. What was he to do!

<P>The only way in which Mr. Pickwick could catch a glimpse of his mysterious
visitor with the least danger of being seen himself, was by creeping on
to the bed, and peeping out from between the curtains on the opposite side.
To this manoeuvre he accordingly resorted. Keeping the curtains carefully
closed with his hand, so that nothing more of him could be seen than his
face and night-cap, and putting on his spectacles, he mustered up courage,
and looked out.

<P>Mr. Pickwick almost fainted with horror and dismay. Standing before
the dressing-glass was a middle-aged lady, in yellow curl-papers, busily
engaged in brushing what ladies call their "back-hair." However the unconscious
middle-aged lady came into that room, it was quite clear that she contemplated
remaining there for the night; for she had brought a rushlight and shade
with her, which, with praiseworthy precaution against fire, she had stationed
in a basin on the floor, where it was glimmering away, like a gigantic
lighthouse in a particularly small piece of water.

<P>"Bless my soul," thought Mr. Pickwick, "what a dreadful thing!"

<P>"Hem!" said the lady; and in went Mr. Pickwick's head with automaton-like
rapidity.

<P>"I never met with anything so awful as this." thought poor Mr. Pickwick,
the cold perspiration starting in drops upon his night-cap. "Never. This
is fearful."

<P>It was quite impossible to resist the urgent desire to see what was
going forward. So out went Mr. Pickwick's head again. The prospect was
worse than before. The middle-aged lady had finished arranging her hair;
had carefully enveloped it in a muslin night-cap with a small plaited border;
and was gazing pensively on the fire.

<P>"This matter is growing alarming," reasoned Mr. Pickwick with himself.
"I can't allow things to go on in this way. By the self-possession of that
lady it is clear to me that I must have come into the wrong room. If I
call out she'll alarm the house; but if I remain here the consequences
will be still more frightful."

<P>Mr. Pickwick, it is quite unnecessary to say, was one of the most modest
and delicate-minded of mortals. The very idea of exhibiting his night-cap
to a lady overpowered him, but he had tied those confounded strings in
a knot, and, do what he would, he couldn't get it off. The disclosure must
be made. There was only one other way of doing it. He shrunk behind the
curtains, and called out very loudly;

<P>"Ha--hum!"

<P>That the lady started at this unexpected sound was evident, by her falling
up against the rushlight shade; that she persuaded herself it must have
been the effect of imagination was equally clear, for when Mr. Pickwick,
under the impression that she had fainted away stone-dead from fright,
ventured to peep out again, she was gazing pensively on the fire as before.

<P>"Most extraordinary female this," thought Mr. Pickwick, popping in again.
"Ha--hum!"

<P>These last sounds, so like those in which, as legends inform us, the
ferocious giant Blunderbore was in the habit of expressing his opinion
that it was time to lay the cloth, were too distinctly audible to be again
mistaken for the workings of fancy.

<P>"Gracious Heaven!" said the middle-aged lady, "what's that?"

<P>"It's--it's--only a gentleman, Ma'am," said Mr. Pickwick from behind
the curtains.

<P>"A gentleman!" said the lady with a terrific scream.

<P>"It's all over!" thought Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"A strange man!" shrieked the lady. Another instant and the house would
be alarmed. Her garments rustled as she rushed towards the door.

<P>"Ma'am," said Mr. Pickwick, thrusting out his head, in the extremity
of his desperation, "Ma'am!"

<P>Now, although Mr. Pickwick was not actuated by any definite object in
putting out his head, it was instantaneously productive of a good effect.
The lady, as we have already stated, was near the door. She must pass it,
to reach the staircase, and she would most undoubtedly have done so by
this time, had not the sudden apparition of Mr. Pickwick's night-cap driven
her back into the remotest corner of the apartment, where she stood staring
wildly at Mr. Pickwick, while Mr. Pickwick in his turn stared wildly at
her.

<P>"Wretch," said the lady, covering her eyes with her hands, "what do
you want here?"

<P>"Nothing, Ma'am; nothing, whatever, Ma'am;" said Mr. Pickwick earnestly.

<P>"Nothing!" said the lady, looking up.

<P>"Nothing, Ma'am, upon my honour," said Mr. Pickwick, nodding his head
so energetically that the tassel of his night-cap danced again. "I am almost
ready to sink, Ma'am, beneath the confusion of addressing a lady in my
night-cap (here the lady hastily snatched off hers), but I can't get it
off, Ma'am (here Mr. Pickwick gave it a tremendous tug, in proof of the
statement). It is evident to me, Ma'am, now, that I have mistaken this
bed-room for my own. I had not been here five minutes, Ma'am, when you
suddenly entered it."

<P>"If this improbable story be really true, sir," said the lady, sobbing
violently, "you will leave it instantly."

<P>"I will, Ma'am, with the greatest pleasure," replied Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"Instantly, sir," said the lady.

<P>"Certainly, Ma'am," interposed Mr. Pickwick very quickly. "Certainly,
Ma'am. I--I--am very sorry, Ma'am,' said Mr. Pickwick, making his appearance
at the bottom of the bed, "to have been the innocent occasion of this alarm
and emotion; deeply sorry, Ma'am."

<P>The lady pointed to the door. One excellent quality of Mr. Pickwick's
character was beautifully displayed at this moment, under the most trying
circumstances. Although he had hastily put on his hat over his night-cap,
after the manner of the old patrol; although he carried his shoes and gaiters
in his hand, and his coat and waistcoat over his arm; nothing could subdue
his native politeness.

<P>"I am exceedingly sorry, Ma'am," said Mr. Pickwick, bowing very low.

<P>"If you are, sir, you will at once leave the room," said the lady.

<P>"Immediately, Ma'am; this instant, Ma'am," said Mr. Pickwick, opening
the door, and dropping both his shoes with a crash in so doing.

<P>"I trust, Ma'am," resumed Mr. Pickwick, gathering up his shoes, and
turning round to bow again: "I trust, Ma'am, that my unblemished character,
and the devoted respect I entertain for your sex, will plead as some slight
excuse for this"--But before Mr. Pickwick could conclude the sentence the
lady had thrust him into the passage, and locked and bolted the door behind
him.

<P>Whatever grounds of self-congratulation Mr. Pickwick might have for
having escaped so quietly from his late awkward situation, his present
position was by no means enviable. He was alone, in an open passage, in
a strange house, in the middle of the night, half dressed; it was not to
be supposed that he could find his way in perfect darkness to a room which
he had been wholly unable to discover with a light, and if he made the
slightest noise in his fruitless attempts to do so, he stood every chance
of being shot at, and perhaps killed, by some wakeful traveller. He had
no resource but to remain where he was until daylight appeared. So after
groping his way a few paces down the passage, and, to his infinite alarm,
stumbling over several pairs of boots in so doing, Mr. Pickwick crouched
into a little recess in the wall, to wait for morning as philosophically
as he might.

<P>He was not destined, however, to undergo this additional trial of patience:
for he had not been long ensconced in his present concealment when, to
his unspeakable horror, a man, bearing a light, appeared at the end of
the passage. His horror was suddenly converted into joy, however, when
he recognised the form of his faithful attendant. It was indeed Mr. Samuel
Weller, who after sitting up thus late, in conversation with the Boots,
who was sitting up for the mail, was now about to retire to rest.

<P>"Sam," said Mr. Pickwick, suddenly appearing before him, "where's my
bed-room?"

<P>Mr. Weller stared at his master with the most emphatic surprise; and
it was not until the question had been repeated three several times, that
he turned round, and led the way to the long-sought apartment.

<P>"Sam," said Mr. Pickwick as he got into bed, "I have made one of the
most extraordinary mistakes to-night, that ever were heard of."

<P>"Wery likely, sir," replied Mr. Weller drily.

<P>"But of this I am determined, Sam," said Mr. Pickwick; "that if I were
to stop in this house for six months, I would never trust myself about
it, alone, again."

<P>"That's the wery prudentest resolution as you could come to, sir," replied
Mr. Weller. "You rayther want somebody to look arter you, sir, wen your
judgment goes out a wisitin'."

<P>"What do you mean by that, Sam?" said Mr. Pickwick. He raised himself
in bed, and extended his hand, as if he were about to say something more;
but suddenly checking himself, turned round, and bade his valet "Good night."

<P>"Good night, sir," replied Mr. Weller. He paused when he got outside
the door--shook his head--walked on--stopped--snuffed the candle--shook
his head again--and finally proceeded slowly to his chamber, apparently
buried in the profoundest meditation.
