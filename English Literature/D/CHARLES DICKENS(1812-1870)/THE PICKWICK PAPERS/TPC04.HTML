<CENTER><FONT SIZE=-1>A FIELD DAY AND BIVOUAC. MORE NEW FRIENDS. AN INVITATION
TO THE COUNTRY</FONT></CENTER>


<P>M<FONT SIZE=-1>ANY</FONT> authors entertain, not only a foolish, but
a really dishonest objection to acknowledge the sources from whence they
derive much valuable information. We have no such feeling. We are merely
endeavouring to discharge, in an upright manner, the responsible duties
of our editorial functions; and whatever ambition we might have felt under
other circumstances to lay claim to the authorship of these advantures,
a regard for truth forbids us to do more than claim the merit of their
judicious arrangement and impartial narration. The Pickwick Papers are
our New River Head; and we may be compared to the New River Company. The
labours of others have raised for us an immense reservoir of important
facts. We merely lay them on, and communicate them, in a clear and gentle
stream, through the medium of these numbers, to a world thirsting for Pickwickian
knowledge.

<P>Acting in this spirit, and resolutely proceeding on our determination
to avow our obligations to the authorities we have consulted, we frankly
say, that to the note-book of Mr. Snodgrass are we indebted for the particulars
recorded in this, and the succeeding chapter--particulars which, now that
we have disburdened our conscience, we shall proceed to detail without
further comment.

<P>The whole population of Rochester and the adjoining towns rose from
their beds at an early hour of the following morning, in a state of the
utmost bustle and excitement. A grand review was to take place upon the
Lines. The manoeuvres of half-a-dozen regiments were to be inspected by
the eagle eye of the commander-in-chief; temporary fortifications had been
erected, the citadel was to be attacked and taken, and a mine was to be
sprung.

<P>Mr. Pickwick was, as our readers may have gathered from the slight extract
we gave from his description of Chatham, an enthusiastic admirer of the
army. Nothing could have been more delightful to him--nothing could have
harmonised so well with the peculiar feeling of each of his companions--as
this sight. Accordingly they were soon a-foot, and walking in the direction
of the scene of action, towards which crowds of people were already pouring
from a variety of quarters.

<P>The appearance of everything on the Lines denoted that the approaching
ceremony was one of the utmost grandeur and importance. There were sentries
posted to keep the ground for the troops, and servants on the batteries
keeping places for the ladies, and sergeants running to and fro, with vellum-covered
books under their arms, and Colonel Bulder, in full military uniform, on
horseback, galloping first to one place and then to another, and backing
his horse among the people, and prancing, and curvetting, and shouting
in a most alarming manner, and making himself very hoarse in the voice,
and very red in the face, without any assignable cause or reason whatever.
Officers were running backwards and forwards, first communicating with
Colonel Bulder, and then ordering the sergeants, and then running away
altogether; and even the very privates themselves looked from behind their
glazed stocks with an air of mysterious solemnity, which sufficiently bespoke
the special nature of the occasion.

<P>Mr. Pickwick and his three companions stationed themselves in the front
rank of the crowd, and patiently awaited the commencement of the proceedings.
The throng was increasing every moment; and the efforts they were compelled
to make, to retain the position they had gained, sufficiently occupied
their attention during the two hours that ensued. At one time there was
a sudden pressure from behind; and then Mr. Pickwick was jerked forwaard
for several yards, with a degree of speed and elasticity highly inconsistent
with the general grvity of his demeanour; at another moment there was a
request to "keep back" from the front, and then the butt-end of a musket
was either dropped upon Mr. Pickwick's toe, to remind him of the demand,
or thrust into his chest, to ensure its being complied with. Then some
facetious gentleman on the left, after pressing sideways in a body, and
squeezing Mr. Snodgrass into the very last extreme of human torture, would
request to know "vere he vos a shovin' to"; and when Mr. Winkle had done
expressing his excessive indignation at witnessing this unprovoked assault,
some person behind would knock his hat over his eyes, and beg the favour
of his putting his head in his pocket. These, and other practical witticisms,
coupled with the unaccountable absence of Mr. Tupman (who had suddenly
disappeared, and was nowhere to be found), rendered their situation upon
the whole rather more uncomfortable than pleasing or desirable.

<P>At length that low roar of many voices ran through the crowd, which
usually announces the arrival of whatever they have been waiting for. All
eyes were turned in the direction of the sally-port. A few moments of eager
expectation, and colours were seen fluttering gaily in the air, arms glistened
brightly in the sun, column after column poured on to the plain. The troops
halted and formed; the word of command rung through the line, there was
a general clash of muskets as arms were presented; and the commander-in-chief,
attended by Colonel Bulder and numerous officers, cantered to the front.
The military bands struck up all together; the horses stood upon two legs
each, cantered backwards, and whisked their tails about in all directions:
the dogs barked, the mob screamed, the troops recovered, and nothing was
to be seen on either side, as far as the eye could reach, but a long perspective
of red coats and white trousers, fixed and motionless.

<P>Mr. Pickwick had been so fully occupied in falling about, and disentangling
himself, miraculously, from between the legs of horses, that he had not
enjoyed sufficient leisure to observe the scene before him, until it assumed
the appearance we have just described. When he was at last enabled to stand
firmly on his legs, his gratification and delight were unbounded.

<P>"Can anything be finer or more delightful?" he inquired of Mr. Winkle.

<P>"Nothing," replied that gentleman, who had had a short man standing
on each of his feet for the quarter of an hour immediately preceding.

<P>"It is indeed a noble and a brilliant sight," said Mr. Snodgrass, in
whose bosom a blaze of poetry was rapidly bursting forth, "to see the gallant
defenders of their country drawn up in brilliant array before its peaceful
citizens; their faces beaming--not with warlike ferocity, but with civilised
gentleness; their eyes flashing--not with the rude fire of rapine or revenge,
but with the soft light of humanity and intelligence."

<P>Mr. Pickwick fully entered into the spirit of this eulogium, but he
could not exactly re-echo its terms; for the soft light of intelligence
burnt rather feebly in the eyes of the warriors, inasmuch as the command
"eyes front" had been given, and all the spectator saw before him was several
thousand pairs of optics, staring straight forward, wholly divested of
any expression whatever.

<P>"We are in a capital situation now," said Mr. Pickwick, looking round
him. The crowd had gradually dispersed in their immediate vicinity, and
they were nearly alone.

<P>"Capital!" echoed both Mr. Snodgrass and Mr. Winkle.

<P>"What are they doing now?" inquired Mr. Pickwick, adjusting his spectacles.

<P>"I--I--rather think," said Mr. Winkle, changing colour--"I rather think
they're going to fire."

<P>"Nonsense," said Mr. Pickwick, hastily.

<P>"I--I--really think they are," urged Mr. Snodgrass, somewhat alarmed.

<P>"Impossible," replied Mr. Pickwick. He had hardly uttered the word,
when the whole half-dozen regiments levelled their muskets as if they had
but one common object, and that object the Pickwickians, and burst forth
with the most awful and tremendous discharge that ever shook the earth
to its centre, or an elderly gentleman off his.

<P>It was in this trying situation, exposed to a galling fire of blank
cartridges, and harassed by the operations of the military, a fresh body
of whom had begun to fall in on the opposite side, that Mr. Pickwick displayed
that perfect coolness and self-possession, which are the indispensable
accompaniments of a great mind. He seized Mr. Winkle by the arm, and placing
himself between that gentleman and Mr. Snodgrass, earnestly besought them
to remember that beyond the possibility of being rendered deaf by the noise,
there was no immediate danger to be apprehended from the firing.

<P>"But--but--suppose some of the men should happen to have ball cartridges
by mistake," remonstrated Mr. Winkle, pallid at the supposition he was
himself conjuring up. "I heard something whistle through the air just now--so
sharp; close to my ear."

<P>"We had better throw ourselves on our faces, hadn't we?" said Mr. Snodgrass.

<P>"No, no--it's over now," said Mr. Pickwick. His lip might quiver, and
his cheek might blanch, but no expression of fear or concern escaped the
lips of that immortal man.

<P>Mr. Pickwick was right: the firing ceased; but he had scarcely time
to congratulate himself on the accuracy of his opinion, when a quick movement
was visible in the line: the hoarse shout of the word of command ran along
it, and before either of the party could form a guess at the meaning of
this new manoeuvre, the whole of the half-dozen regiments, with fixed bayonets,
charged at double quick time down upon the very spot on which Mr. Pickwick
and his friends were stationed.

<P>Man is but mortal: and there is a point beyond which human courage cannot
extend. Mr. Pickwick gazed through his spectacles for an instant on the
advancing mass, and then fairly turned his back and--we will not say fled;
firstly, because it is an ignoble term, and, secondly, because Mr. Pickwick's
figure was by no means adapted for that mode of retreat--he trotted away,
at as quick a rate as his legs would convey him; so quickly, indeed, that
he did not perceive the awkwardness of his situation, to the full extent,
until too late.

<P>The opposite troops, whose falling-in had perplexed Mr.

<P>Pickwick a few seconds before, were drawn up to repel the mimic attack
of the sham besiegers of the citadel; and the consequence was that Mr.
Pickwick and his two companions found themselves suddenly inclosed between
two lines of great length, the one advancing at a rapid pace, and the other
firmly waiting the collision in hostile array.

<P>"Hoi!" shouted the officers of the advancing line.

<P>"Get out of the way!" cried the officers of the stationary one.

<P>"Where are we to go to?" screamed the agitated Pickwickians.

<P>"Hoi--hoi--hoi!" was the only reply. There was a moment of intense bewilderment,
a heavy tramp of footsteps, a violent concussion, a smothered laugh; the
half-dozen regiments were half a thousand yards off, and the soles of Mr.
Pickwick's boots were elevated in air.

<P>Mr. Snodgrass and Mr. Winkle had each performed a compulsory somerset
with remarkable agility, when the first object that met the eyes of the
latter as he sat on the ground, staunching with a yellow silk handkerchief
the stream of life which issued from his nose, was his venerated leader
at some distance off, running after his own hat, which was gamboling playfully
away in perspective.

<P>There are very few moments in a man's existence when he experiences
so much ludicrous distress, or meets with so little charitable commiseration,
as when he is in pursuit of his own hat. A vast deal of coolness, and a
peculiar degree of judgment, are requisite in catching a hat. A man must
not be precipitate, or he runs over it; he must not rush into the opposite
extreme, or he loses it altogether. The best way is, to keep gently up
with the object of pursuit, to be wary and cautious, to watch your opportunity
well, get gradually before it, then make a rapid dive, seize it by the
crown, and stick it firmly on your head: smiling pleasantly all the time,
as if you thought it as good a joke as anybody else.

<P>There was a fine gentle wind, and Mr. Pickwick's hat rolled sportively
before it. The wind puffed, and Mr. Pickwick puffed, and the hat rolled
over and over as merrily as a lively porpoise in a strong tide; and on
it might have rolled, far beyond Mr. Pickwick's reach, had not its course
been providentially stopped, just as that gentleman was on the point of
resigning it to its fate.

<P>Mr. Pickwick, we say, was completely exhausted, and about to give up
the chase, when the hat was blown with some violence against the wheel
of a carriage, which was drawn up in a line with half-a-dozen other vehicles
on the spot to which his steps had been directed. Mr. Pickwick, perceiving
his advantage, darted briskly forward, secured his property, planted it
on his head, and paused to take breath. He had not been stationary half
a minute, when he heard his own name eagerly pronounced by a voice, which
he at once recognised as Mr. Tupman's, and, looking upwards, he beheld
a sight which filled him with surprise and pleasure.

<P>In an open barouche, the horses of which had been taken out, the better
to accommodate it to the crowded place, stood a stout old gentleman, in
a blue coat and bright buttons, corduroy breeches and top-boots, two young
ladies in scarfs and feathers, a young gentleman apparently enamoured of
one of the young ladies in scarfs and feathers, a lady of doubtful age,
probably the aunt of the aforesaid, and Mr. Tupman, as easy and unconcerned
as if he had belonged to the family from the first moments of his infancy.
Fastened up behind the barouche was a hamper of spacious dimensions--one
of those hampers which always awakens in a contemplative mind associations
connected with cold fowls, tongues, and bottles of wine--and on the box
sat a fat and red-faced boy, in a state of somnolency, whom no speculative
observer could have regarded for an instant without setting down as the
official dispenser of the contents of the before-mentioned hamper, when
the proper time for their consumption should arrive.

<P>Mr. Pickwick had bestowed a hasty glance on these interesting objects,
when he was again greeted by his faithful disciple.

<P>"Pickwick--Pickwick," said Mr. Tupman: "come up here. Make haste."

<P>"Come along, sir. Pray, come up," said the stout gentleman. "Joe!--damn
that boy, he's gone to sleep again.--Joe, let down the steps." The fat
boy rolled slowly off the box, let down the steps, and held the carriage
door invitingly open. Mr. Snodgrass and Mr. Winkle came up at the moment.

<P>"Room for you all, gentlemen," said the stout man. "Two inside, and
one out. Joe, make room for one of these gentlemen on the box. Now, sir,
come along;" and the stout gentleman extended his arm, and pulled first
Mr. Pickwick, and then Mr. Snodgrass, into the barouche by main force.
Mr. Winkle mounted to the box, the fat boy waddled to the same perch, and
fell fast asleep instantly.

<P>"Well, gentlemen," said the stout man, "very glad to see you. Know you
very well, gentlemen, though you mayn't remember me. I spent some ev'nins
at your club last winter--picked up my friend Mr. Tupman here this morning,
and very glad I was to see him. Well, sir, and how are you? You do look
uncommon well, to be sure."

<P>Mr. Pickwick acknowledged the compliment, and cordially shook hands
with the stout gentleman in the top boots.

<P>"Well, and how are you, sir?" said the stout gentleman, addressing Mr.
Snodgrass with paternal anxiety. "Charming, eh? Well, that's right--that's
right. And how are you, sir (to Mr. Winkle)? Well, I am glad to hear you
say you are well; very glad I am, to be sure. My daughters, gentlemen--my
gals these are; and that's my sister, Miss Rachael Wardle. She's a Miss,
she is; and yet she an't a Miss--eh, sir, eh?" And the stout gentleman
playfully inserted his elbow between the ribs of Mr. Pickwick, and laughed
very heartily.

<P>"Lor, brother!" said Miss Wardle, with a deprecating smile.

<P>"True, true," said the stout gentleman; "no one can deny it. Gentlemen,
I beg your pardon; this is my friend Mr. Trundle. And now you all know
each other, let's be comfortable and happy, and see what's going forward;
that's what I say." So the stout gentleman put on his spectacles, and Mr.
Pickwick pulled out his glass, and everybody stood up in the carriage,
and looked over somebody else's shoulder at the evolutions of the military.

<P>Astounding evolutions they were, one rank firing over the heads of another
rank, and then running away; and then the other rank firing over the heads
of another rank, and running away in their turn; and then forming squares,
with officers in the centre; and then descending the trench on one side
with scaling ladders, and ascending it on the other again by the same means;
and knocking down barricades of baskets, and behaving in the most gallant
manner possible. Then there was such a ramming down of the contents of
enormous guns on the battery, with instruments like magnified mops; such
a preparation before they were let off, and such an awful noise when they
did go, that the air resounded with the screams of ladies. The young Miss
Wardles were so frightened, that Mr. Trundle was actually obliged to hold
one of them up in the carriage, while Mr. Snodgrass supported the other,
and Mr. Wardle's sister suffered under such a dreadful state of nervous
alarm, that Mr. Tupman found it indispensably necessary to put his arm
round her waist, to keep her up at all. Everybody was excited, except the
fat boy, and he slept as soundly as if the roaring of cannon were his ordinary
lullaby.

<P>"Joe, Joe!" said the stout gentleman, when the citadel was taken, and
the besiegers and besieged sat down to dinner. "Damn that boy, he's gone
to sleep again. Be good enough to pinch him, sir--in the leg, if you please;
nothing else wakes him--thank you. Undo the hamper, Joe."

<P>The fat boy, who had been effectually roused by the compression of a
portion of his leg between the finger and thumb of Mr. Winkle, rolled off
the box once again, and proceeded to unpack the hamper, with more expedition
than could have been expected from his previous inactivity.

<P>"Now, we must sit close," said the stout gentleman. After a great many
jokes about squeezing the ladies' sleeves, and a vast quantity of blushing
at sundry jocose proposals, that the ladies should sit in the gentlemen's
laps, the whole party were stowed down in the barouche; and the stout gentleman
proceeded to hand the things from the fat boy (who had mounted up behind
for the purpose) into the carriage.

<P>"Now, Joe, knives and forks." The knives and forks were handed in, and
the ladies and gentlemen inside, and Mr. Winkle on the box, were each furnished
with those useful instruments.

<P>"Plates, Joe, plates." A similar process employed in the distribution
of the crockery.

<P>"Now, Joe, the fowls. Damn that boy; he's gone to sleep again. Joe!
Joe!" (Sundry taps on the head with a stick, and the fat boy, with some
difficulty, roused from his lethargy.) "Come, hand in the eatables."

<P>There was something in the sound of the last word which roused the unctuous
boy. He jumped up: and the leaden eyes, which twinkled behind his mountainous
cheeks, leered horribly upon the food as he unpacked it from the basket.

<P>"Now make haste," said Mr. Wardle; for the fat boy was hanging fondly
over a capon, which he seemed wholly unable to part with. The boy sighed
deeply, and, bestowing an ardent gaze upon its plumpness, unwillingly consigned
it to his master.

<P>"That's right--look sharp. Now the tongue--now the pigeon-pie. Take
care of that veal and ham--mind the lobsters--take the salad out of the
cloth--give me the dressing." Such were the hurried orders which issued
from the lips of Mr. Wardle, as he handed in the different articles described,
and placed dishes in everybody's hands, and on everybody's knees, in endless
number.

<P>"Now an't this capital?" inquired that jolly personage, when the work
of destruction had commenced.

<P>"Capital!" said Mr. Winkle, who was carving a fowl on the box.

<P>"Glass of wine?"

<P>"With the greatest pleasure."

<P>"You'd better have a bottle to yourself, up there, hadn't you?"

<P>"You're very good."

<P>"Joe!"

<P>"Yes, sir." (He wasn't asleep this time, having just succeeded in abstracting
a veal patty.)

<P>"Bottle of wine to the gentleman on the box. Glad to see you, sir."

<P>"Thank'ee." Mr. Winkle emptied his glass, and placed the bottle on the
coach-box, by his side.

<P>"Will you permit me to have the pleasure, sir?" said Mr. Trundle to
Mr. Winkle.

<P>"With great pleasure," replied Mr. Winkle to Mr. Trundle: and then the
two gentlemen took wine, after which they took a glass of wine round, ladies
and all.

<P>"How dear Emily is flirting with the stranger gentleman," whispered
the spinster aunt, with true spinster-aunt-like envy, to her brother Mr.
Wardle.

<P>"Oh! I don't know," said the jolly old gentleman; "all very natural,
I daresay--nothing unusual. Mr. Pickwick, some wine, sir?" Mr. Pickwick,
who had been deeply investigating the interior of the pigeon-pie, readily
assented.

<P>"Emily, my dear," said the spinster aunt, with a patronising air, "don't
talk so loud, love."

<P>"Lor', aunt!"

<P>"Aunt and the little old gentleman want to have it all to themselves,
I think," whispered Miss Isabella Wardle to her sister Emily. The young
ladies laughed very heartily, and the old one tried to look amiable, but
couldn't manage it.

<P>"Young girls have <I>such</I> spirits," said Miss Wardle to Mr. Tupman,
with an air of gentle commiseration, as if animal spirits were contraband,
and their possession without a permit, a high crime and misdemeanour.

<P>"Oh, they have," replied Mr. Tupman, not exactly making the sort of
reply that was expected from him. "It's quite delightful."

<P>"Hem!" said Miss Wardle, rather dubiously.

<P>"Will you permit me," said Mr. Tupman, in his blandest manner, touching
the enchanting Rachael's wrist with one hand, and gently elevating the
bottle with the other. "Will you permit me?"

<P>"Oh, sir!" Mr. Tupman looked most impressive; and Rachael expressed
her fear that more guns were going off, in which case, of course, she would
have required support again.

<P>"Do you think my dear nieces pretty?" whispered their affectionate aunt
to Mr. Tupman.

<P>"I should, if their aunt wasn't here," replied the ready Pickwickian,
with a passionate glance.

<P>"Oh, you naughty man--but really, if their complexions were a little
<I>little</I> better, don't you think they would be nice-looking girls--by
candle-light?"

<P>"Yes; I think they would;" said Mr. Tupman, with an air of indifference.

<P>"Oh, you quiz--I know what you were going to say."

<P>"What?" inquired Mr. Tupman, who had not precisely made up his mind
to say anything at all.

<P>"You were going to say, that Isabel stoops--I know you were--you men
are such observers. Well, so she does; it can't be denied; and, certainly,
if there is one thing more than another that makes a girl look ugly, it
is stooping. I often tell her, that when she gets a little older, she'll
be quite frightful. Well, you <I>are</I> a quiz!"

<P>Mr. Tupman had no objection to earning the reputation at so cheap a
rate: so he looked very knowing, and smiled mysteriously.

<P>"What a sarcastic smile," said the admiring Rachael: "I declare I'm
quite afraid of you."

<P>"Afraid of me!"

<P>"Oh, you can't disguise anything from me--I know what that smile means,
very well."

<P>"What?" said Mr. Tupman, who had not the slightest notion himself.

<P>"You mean," said the amiable aunt, sinking her voice still lower--"You
mean, that you don't think Isabella's stooping is as bad as Emily's boldness.
Well, she <I>is</I> bold! You cannot think how wretched it makes me sometimes.
I'm sure I cry about it for hours together--my dear brother is <I>so</I>
good, and <I>so</I> unsuspicious, that he never sees it; if he did, I'm
quite certain it would break his heart. I wish I could think it was only
manner--I hope it may be--" (here the affectionate relative heaved a deep
sigh, and shook her head despondingly).

<P>"I'm sure aunt's talking about us," whispered Miss Emily Wardle to her
sister--"I'm quite certain of it--she looks so malicious."

<P>"Is she?" replied Isabella--"Hem! aunt dear!"

<P>"Yes, my dear love!"

<P>"I'm <I>so</I> afraid you'll catch cold, aunt--have a silk handkerchief
to tie round your dear old head--you really should take care of yourself--consider
your age!"

<P>However well deserved this piece of retaliation might have been, it
was as vindictive a one as could well have been resorted to. There is no
guessing in what form of reply the aunt's indignation would have vented
itself, had not Mr. Wardle unconsciously changed the subject, by calling
emphatically for Joe.

<P>"Damn that boy," said the old gentleman, "he's gone to sleep again."

<P>"Very extraordinary boy, that," said Mr. Pickwick, "does he always sleep
in this way?"

<P>"Sleep!" said the old gentleman, "he's always asleep. Goes on errands
fast asleep, and snores as he waits at table."

<P>"How very odd!" said Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"Ah! odd indeed," returned the old gentleman; "I'm proud of that boy--wouldn't
part with him on any account --he's a natural curiosity! Here, Joe--Joe--take
these things away, and open another bottle--d'ye hear?"

<P>The fat boy rose, opened his eyes, swallowed the huge piece of pie he
had been in the act of masticating when he last fell asleep, and slowly
obeyed his master's orders--gloating languidly over the remains of the
feast, as he removed the plates, and deposited them in the hamper. The
fresh bottle was produced, and speedily emptied: the hamper was made fast
in its old place--the fat boy once more mounted the box--the spectacles
and pocket-glass were again adjusted and the evolutions of the military
recommenced. There was a great fizzing and banging of guns, and starting
of ladies--and then a mine was sprung, to the gratification of everybody--and
when the mine had gone off, the military and the company followed its example,
and went off too.

<P>"Now, mind," said the old gentleman, as he shook hands with Mr. Pickwick
at the conclusion of a conversation which had been carried on at intervals,
during the conclusion of the proceedings--"we shall see you all to-morrow."

<P>"Most certainly," replied Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"You have got the address."

<P>"Manor Farm, Dingley Dell," said Mr Pickwick, consulting his pocket-book.

<P>"That's it," said the old gentleman. "I don't let you off, mind, under
a week; and undertake that you shall see everything worth seeing. If you've
come down for a country life, come to me, and I'll give you plenty of it.
Joe--damn that boy, he's gone to sleep again--Joe, help Tom put in the
horses."

<P>The horses were put in--the driver mounted--the fat boy clambered up
by his side--farewells were exchanged--and the carriage rattled off. As
the Pickwickians turned round to take a last glimpse of it, the setting
sun cast a rich glow on the faces of their entertainers, and fell upon
the form of the fat boy. His head was sunk upon his bosom; and he slumbered
again.
