<CENTER><FONT SIZE=-1>SAMUEL WELLER MAKES A PILGRIMAGE TO DORKING, AND
BEHOLDS HIS MOTHER-IN-LAW</FONT></CENTER>


<P>T<FONT SIZE=-1>HERE</FONT> still remaining an interval of two days before
the time agreed upon for the departure of the Pickwickians to Dingley Dell,
Mr. Weller sat himself down in a back room at the George and Vulture, after
eating an early dinner, to muse on the best way of disposing of his time.
It was a remarkably fine day; and he had not turned the matter over in
his mind ten minutes, when he was suddenly stricken filial and affectionate;
and it occurred to him so strongly that he ought to go down and see his
father, and pay his duty to his mother-in-law, that he was lost in astonishment
at his own remissness in never thinking of this moral obligation before.
Anxious to atone for his past neglect without another hour's delay, he
straightway walked up-stairs to Mr. Pickwick, and requested leave of absence
for this laudable purpose.

<P>"Certainly, Sam, certainly," said Mr. Pickwick, his eyes glistening
with delight at this manifestation of filial feeling on the part of his
attendant; "certainly, Sam."

<P>Mr. Weller made a grateful bow.

<P>"I am very glad to see that you have so high a sense of your duties
as a son, Sam," said Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"I always had, sir," replied Mr. Weller.

<P>"That's a very gratifying reflection, Sam," said Mr. Pickwick, approvingly.

<P>"Wery, sir," replied Mr. Weller; "if ever I wanted anythin' o' my father,
I always asked for it in a wery 'spectful and obligin' manner. If he didn't
give it me, I took it, for fear I should be led to do anythin' wrong, through
not havin' it. I saved him a world o' trouble in this vay, sir."

<P>"That's not precisely what I meant, Sam," said Mr. Pickwick, shaking
his head, with a slight smile.

<P>"All good feelin', sir--the wery best intentions, as the gen'l'm'n said
ven he run away from his wife 'cos she seemed unhappy with him," replied
Mr. Weller.

<P>"You may go, Sam," said Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"Thank'ee, sir," replied Mr. Weller; and having made his best bow, and
put on his best clothes, Sam planted himself on the top of the Arundel
coach, and journeyed on to Dorking.

<P>The Marquis of Granby in Mrs. Weller's time was quite a model of a road-side
public-house of the better class--just large enough to be convenient, and
small enough to be snug. On the opposite side of the road was a large sign-board
on a high post, representing the head and shoulders of a gentleman with
an apoplectic countenance, in a red coat with deep blue facings, and a
touch of the same blue over his three-cornered hat, for a sky. Over that
again were a pair of flags; beneath the last button of his coat were a
couple of cannon; and the whole formed an expressive and undoubted likeness
of the Marquis of Granby of glorious memory.

<P>The bar window displayed a choice collection of geranium plants, and
a well-dusted row of spirit phials. The open shutters bore a variety of
golden inscriptions, eulogistic of good beds and neat wines; and the choice
group of countrymen and hostlers lounging about the stable-door and horsetrough,
afforded presumptive proof of the excellent quality of the ale and spirits
which were sold within. Sam Weller paused, when he dismounted from the
coach, to note all these little indications of a thriving business, with
the eye of an experienced traveller; and having done so, stepped in at
once, highly satisfied with everything he had observed.

<P>"Now, then!" said a shrill female voice the instant Sam thrust his head
in at the door, "what do you want, young man?"

<P>Sam looked round in the direction whence the voice proceeded. It came
from a rather stout lady of comfortable appearance, who was seated beside
the fireplace in the bar, blowing the fire to make the kettle boil for
tea. She was not alone; for on the other side of the fireplace, sitting
bolt upright in a high-backed chair, was a man in threadbare black clothes,
with a back almost as long and stiff as that of the chair itself, who caught
Sam's most particular and especial attention at once.

<P>He was a prim-faced, red-nosed man, with a long, thin countenance, and
a semi-rattlesnake sort of eye--rather sharp, but decidedly bad. He wore
very short trousers, and black-cotton stockings, which, like the rest of
his apparel, were particularly rusty. His looks were starched, but his
white neckerchief was not, and its long limp ends straggled over his closely-buttoned
waistcoat in a very uncouth and unpicturesque fashion. A pair of old, worn
beaver gloves, a broad-brimmed hat, and a faded green umbrella, with plenty
of whalebone sticking through the bottom, as if to counter-balance the
want of a handle at the top, lay on a chair beside him, and, being disposed
in a very tidy and careful manner, seemed to imply that the red-nosed man,
whoever he was, had no intention of going away in a hurry.

<P>To do the red-nosed man justice, he would have been very far from wise
if he had entertained any such intention; for, to judge from all appearances,
he must have been possessed of a most desirable circle of acquaintance,
if he could have reasonably expected to be more comfortable anywhere else.
The fire was blazing brightly under the influence of the bellows, and the
kettle was singing gaily under the influence of both. A small tray of tea-things
was arranged on the table, a plate of hot buttered toast was gently simmering
before the fire, and the red-nosed man himself was busily engaged in converting
a large slice of bread into the same agreeable edible, through the instrumentality
of a long brass toasting-fork. Beside him stood a glass of reeking hot
pine-apple rum and water, with a slice of lemon in it; and every time the
red-nosed man stopped to bring the round of toast to his eye, with the
view of ascertaining how it got on, he imbibed a drop or two of the hot
pine-apple rum and water, and smiled upon the rather stout lady, as she
blew the fire.

<P>Sam was so lost in the contemplation of this comfortable scene, that
he suffered the first inquiry of the rather stout lady to pass unheeded.
It was not until it had been twice repeated, each time in a shriller tone,
that he became conscious of the impropriety of his behaviour.

<P>"Governor in?" inquired Sam, in reply to the question.

<P>"No, he isn't," replied Mrs. Weller; for the rather stout lady was no
other than the quondam relict and sole executrix of the dead-and-gone Mr.
Clarke; "No, he isn't, and I don't expect him, either."

<P>"I suppose he's drivin' up to-day?" said Sam.

<P>"He may be, or he may not," replied Mrs. Weller, buttering the round
of toast which the red-nosed man had just finished. "I don't know, and,
what's more, I don't care. Ask a blessin', Mr. Stiggins."

<P>The red-nosed man did as he was desired, and instantly commenced on
the toast with fierce voracity.

<P>The appearance of the red-nosed man had induced Sam, at first sight,
to more than half suspect that he was the deputy shepherd of whom his estimable
parent had spoken. The moment he saw him eat, all doubt on the subject
was removed, and he perceived at once that if he purposed to take up his
temporary quarters where he was, he must make his footing good without
delay. He therefore commenced proceedings by putting his arm over the half-door
of the bar, coollv unbolting it, and leisurely walking in.

<P>"Mother-in-law," said Sam, "how are you?"

<P>"Why, I do believe he is a Weller!" said Mrs. W., raising her eyes to
Sam's face, with no very gratified expression of countenance.

<P>"I rayther think he is," said the imperturbable Sam; "and I hope this
here reverend gen'l'm'n'll excuse me saying that I wish I was <I>the</I>
Weller as owns you, mother-in-law."

<P>This was a double-barrelled compliment. It implied that Mrs. Weller
was a most agreeable female, and also that Mr. Stiggins had a clerical
appearance. It made a visible impression at once; and Sam followed up his
advantage by kissing his mother-in-law.

<P>"Get along with you!" said Mrs. Weller, pushing him away.

<P>"For shame, young man!" said the gentleman with the red nose.

<P>"No offence, sir, no offence," replied Sam; "you're wery right, though;
it ain't the right sort o' thing, wen mothers-in-law is young and good
looking, is it, sir?"

<P>"It's all vanity," said Mr. Stiggins.

<P>"Ah, so it is," said Mrs. Weller, setting her cap to rights.

<P>Sam thought it was, too, but he held his peace.

<P>The deputy shepherd seemed by no means best pleased with Sam's arrival;
and when the first effervescence of the compliment had subsided, even Mrs.
Weller looked as if she could have spared him without the smallest inconvenience.
However, there he was; and as he couldn't be decently turned out, they
all three sat down to tea.

<P>"And how's father?" said Sam.

<P>At this inquiry, Mrs. Weller raised her hands, and turned up her eyes,
as if the subject were too painful to be alluded to.

<P>Mr. Stiggins groaned.

<P>"What's the matter with that 'ere gen'l'm'n?" inquired Sam.

<P>"He's shocked at the way your father goes on in," replied Mrs. Weller.

<P>"Oh, he is, is he?" said Sam.

<P>"And with too good reason," added Mrs. Weller, gravely.

<P>Mr. Stiggins took up a fresh piece of toast, and groaned heavily.

<P>"He is a dreadful reprobate," said Mrs. Weller.

<P>"A man of wrath!" exclaimed Mr. Stiggins. He took a large semi-circular
bite out of the toast, and groaned again.

<P>Sam felt very strongly disposed to give the reverend Mr. Stiggins something
to groan for, but he repressed his inclination, and merely asked, "What's
the old 'un up to, now?"

<P>"Up to, indeed!" said Mrs. Weller. "Oh, he has a hard heart. Night after
night does this excellent man--don't frown, Mr. Stiggins: I <I>will</I>
say you <I>are</I> an excellent man--come and sit here, for hours together,
and it has not the least effect upon him."

<P>"Well, that is odd," said Sam; "it 'ud have a wery considerable effect
upon me, if I wos in his place; I know that."

<P>"The fact is, my young friend," said Mr. Stiggins, solemnly, "he has
an obderrate bosom. Oh, my young friend, who else could have resisted the
pleading of sixteen of our fairest sisters, and withstood their exhortations
to subscribe to our noble society for providing the infant negroes in the
West Indies with flannel waistcoats and moral pocket-hand-kerchiefs?"

<P>"What's a moral pocket ankercher?" said Sam; "I never see one o' them
articles o' furniter."

<P>"Those which combine amusement with instruction, my young friend," replied
Mr. Stiggins: "blending select tales with wood-cuts."

<P>"Oh, I know," said Sam; "them as hangs up in the linen-drapers' shops,
with beggars' petitions and all that 'ere upon 'em?"

<P>Mr. Stiggins began a third round of toast, and nodded assent.

<P>"And he wouldn't be persuaded by the ladies, wouldn't he?" said Sam.

<P>"Sat and smoked his pipe, and said the infant negroes were--what did
he say the infant negroes were?" said Mrs. Weller.

<P>"Little humbugs," replied Mr. Stiggins, deeply affected.

<P>"Said the infant negroes were little humbugs," repeated Mrs. Weller.
And they both groaned at the atrocious conduct of the old gentleman.

<P>A great many more iniquities of a similar nature might have been disclosed,
only the toast being all eaten, the tea having got very weak, and Sam holding
out no indications of meaning to go, Mr. Stiggins suddenly recollected
that he had a most pressing appointment with the shepherd, and took himself
off accordingly.

<P>The tea-things had been scarcely put away, and the hearth swept up,
when the London coach deposited Mr. Weller senior at the door; his legs
deposited him in the bar; and his eyes showed him his son.

<P>"What, Sammy!" exclaimed the father.

<P>"What, old Nobs!" ejaculated the son. And they shook hands heartily.

<P>"Wery glad to see you, Sammy," said the elder Mr. Weller, "though how
you've managed to get over your mother-in-law, is a mystery to me. I only
vish you'd write me out the receipt, that's all."

<P>"Hush!" said Sam, "she's at home, old feller."

<P>"She ain't vithin herein'," replied Mr. Weller; "she always goes and
blows up, down-stairs, for a couple of hours arter tea; so we'll just give
ourselves a damp, Sammy."

<P>Saying this, Mr. Weller mixed two glasses of spirits and water, and
produced a couple of pipes. The father and son sitting down opposite each
other: Sam on one side of the fire, in the high-backed chair, and Mr. Weller
senior on the other, in an easy ditto: they proceeded to enjoy themselves
with all due gravity.

<P>"Anybody been here, Sammy?" asked Mr. Weller senior, drily, after a
long silence.

<P>Sam nodded an expressive assent.

<P>"Red-nosed chap?" inquired Mr. Weller.

<P>Sam nodded again.

<P>"Amiable man that 'ere, Sammy," said Mr. Weller, smoking violently.

<P>"Seems so," observed Sam.

<P>"Good hand at accounts," said Mr. Weller.

<P>"Is he?" said Sam.

<P>"Borrows eighteenpence on Monday, and comes on Tuesday for a shillin'
to make it up half a crown; calls again on Vensday for another half crown
to make it five shillin's; and goes on, doubling, till he gets it up to
a five pound note in no time, like them sums in the 'rithmetic book 'bout
the nails in the horse's shoes, Sammy."

<P>Sam intimated by a nod that he recollected the problem alluded to by
his parent.

<P>"So you vouldn't subscribe to the flannel veskits?" said Sam, after
another interval of smoking.

<P>"Cert'nly not," replied Mr. Weller; "what's the good o' flannel veskits
to the young niggers abroad? But I'll tell you what it is, Sammy," said
Mr. Weller, lowering his voice, and bending across the fireplace; "I'd
come down wery handsome towards strait veskits for some people at home."

<P>As Mr. Weller said this, he slowly recovered his former position, and
winked at his first-born, in a profound manner.

<P>"It cert'nly seems a queer start to send out pocket ankerchers to people
as don't know the use on 'em," observed Sam.

<P>"They're alvays a doin' some gammon of that sort, Sammy," replied his
father. "T'other Sunday I wos walkin' up the road, wen who should I see,
a standin' at a chapel-door, with a blue soup-plate in her hand, but your
mother-in-law! I werily believe there was change for a couple o' suv'rins
in it, then, Sammy, all in ha'pence; and as the people come out, they rattled
the pennies in it, till you'd ha' thought that no mortal plate as ever
was baked, could ha' stood the wear and tear. What d'ye think it was all
for?"

<P>"For another tea-drinkin', perhaps," said Sam.

<P>"Not a bit on it," replied the father; "for the shepherd's water-rate,
Sammy."

<P>"The shepherd's water-rate!" said Sam.

<P>"Ay," replied Mr. Weller, "there was three quarters owin', and the shepherd
hadn't paid a farden, not he--perhaps it might be on account that the water
warn't o' much use to him, for it's wery little o' that tap he drinks,
Sammy, wery; he knows a trick worth a good half dozen of that, he does.
Hows'ever, it warn't paid, and so they cuts the water off. Down goes the
shepherd to chapel, gives out as he's a persecuted saint, and says he hopes
the heart of the turncock as cut the water off, 'll be softened, and turned
in the right vay: but he rayther thinks he's booked for somethin' uncomfortable.
Upon this, the women calls a meetin', sings a hymn, wotes your mother-in-law
into the chair, wolunteers a collection next Sunday, and hands it all over
to the shepherd. And if he ain't got enough out on 'em, Sammy, to make
him free of the water company for life," said Mr. Weller, in conclusion,
"I'm one Dutchman, and you're another, and that's all about it."

<P>Mr. Weller smoked for some minutes in silence, and then resumed:

<P>"The worst o' these here shepherds is, my boy, that they reg'larly turns
the heads of all the young ladies, about here. Lord bless their little
hearts, they thinks it's all right, and don't know no better; but they're
the wictims o' gammon, Samivel, they're the wictims o' gammon."

<P>"I s'pose they are," said Sam.

<P>"Nothin' else," said Mr. Weller, shaking his head gravely; "and wot
aggrawates me, Samivel, is to see 'em a wastin' all their time and labour
in making clothes for copper-coloured people as don't want 'em, and taking
no notice of flesh-coloured Christians as do. If I'd my vay, Samivel, I'd
just stick some o' these here lazy shepherds behind a heavy wheelbarrow,
and run 'em up and down a fourteen-inch-wide plank all day. That 'ud shake
the nonsense out of 'em, if anythin' vould."

<P>Mr. Weller having delivered this gentle recipe with strong emphasis,
eked out by a variety of nods and contortions of the eye, emptied his glass
at a draught, and knocked the ashes out of his pipe, with native dignity.

<P>He was engaged in this operation, when a shrill voice was heard in the
passage.

<P>"Here's your dear relation, Sammy," said Mr. Weller; and Mrs. W. hurried
into the room.

<P>"Oh, you've come back, have you!" said Mrs. Weller.

<P>"Yes, my dear," replied Mr. Weller, filling a fresh pipe.

<P>"Has Mr. Stiggins been back?" said Mrs. Weller.

<P>"No, my dear, he hasn't," replied Mr. Weller, lighting the pipe by the
ingenious process of holding to the bowl thereof, between the tongs, a
red-hot coal from the adjacent fire; "and what's more, my dear, I shall
manage to surwive it if he don't come back at all."

<P>"Ugh, you wretch!" said Mrs. Weller.

<P>"Thank'ee, my love," said Mr. Weller.

<P>"Come, come, father," said Sam, "none o' these little lovins afore strangers.
Here's the reverend gen'l'm'n a comin' in now."

<P>At this announcement, Mrs. Weller hastily wiped off the tears which
she had just begun to force on; and Mr. W. drew his chair sullenly into
the chimney corner.

<P>Mr. Stiggins was easily prevailed on, to take another glass of the hot
pine-apple rum and water, and a second, and a third, and then to refresh
himself with a slight supper, previous to beginning again. He sat on the
same side as Mr. Weller senior; and every time he could contrive to do
so, unseen by his wife, that gentleman indicated to his son the hidden
emotions of his bosom, by shaking his fist over the deputy shepherd's head:
a process which afforded his son the most unmingled delight and satisfaction,
the more especially as Mr. Stiggins went on, quietly drinking the hot pine-apple
rum and water, wholly unconscious of what was going on.

<P>The major part of the conversation was confined to Mrs. Weller and the
reverend Mr. Stiggins; and the topics principally descanted on, were the
virtues of the shepherd, the worthiness of his flock, and the high crimes
and misdemeanours of everybody beside; dissertations which the elder Mr.
Weller occasionally interrupted by half-suppressed references to a gentleman
of the name of Walker, and other running commentaries of the same kind.

<P>At length Mr. Stiggins, with several most indubitable symptoms of having
quite as much pine-apple rum and water about him, as he could comfortably
accommodate, took his hat, and his leave: and Sam was, immediately afterwards,
shown to bed by his father. The respectable old gentleman wrung his hand
fervently, and seemed disposed to address some observation to his son;
but on Mrs. Weller advancing towards him, he appeared to relinquish that
intention, and abruptly bade him good night.

<P>Sam was up betimes next day, and having partaken of a hasty breakfast,
prepared to return to London. He had scarcely set foot without the house,
when his father stood before him.

<P>"Goin', Sammy?" inquired Mr. Weller.

<P>"Off at once," replied Sam.

<P>"I vish you could muffle that 'ere Stiggins, and take him vith you,"
said Mr. Weller.

<P>"I am ashamed on you!" said Sam, reproachfully; "what do you let him
show his red nose in the Markis o' Granby at all, for?"

<P>Mr. Weller the elder fixed on his son an earnest look, and replied,
"'Cause I'm a married man, Samivel, 'cause I'm a married man. Wen you're
a married man, Samivel, you'll understand a good many things as you don't
understand now; but vether it's worth while goin' through so much, to learn
so little, as the charity-boy said ven he got to the end of the alphabet,
is a matter o' taste. <I>I</I> rayther think it isn't."

<P>"Well," said Sam, "good bye."

<P>"Tar, tar, Sammy," replied his father.

<P>"I've only got to say this here," said Sam, stopping short, "that if
<I>I</I> was the properiator o' the Markis o' Granby, and that 'ere Stiggins
came and made toast in <I>my</I> bar, I'd--"

<P>"What?" interposed Mr. Weller, with great anxiety. "What?"

<P>"--Pison his rum and water," said Sam.

<P>"No!" said Mr. Weller, shaking his son eagerly by the hand, "would you
raly, Sammy; would you, though?"

<P>"I would," said Sam. "I wouldn't be too hard upon him at first. I'd
drop him in the water-butt, and put the lid on; and if I found he was insensible
to kindness, I'd try the other persvasion."

<P>The elder Mr. Weller bestowed a look of deep, unspeakable admiration
on his son: and, having once more grasped his hand, walked slowly away,
revolving in his mind the numerous reflections to which his advice had
given rise.

<P>Sam looked after him, until he turned a corner of the road: and then
set forward on his walk to London. He meditated, at first, on the probable
consequences of his own advice, and the likelihood and unlikelihood of
his father's adopting it. He dismissed the subject from his mind, however,
with the consolatory reflection that time alone would show; and this is
the reflection we would impress upon the reader.
