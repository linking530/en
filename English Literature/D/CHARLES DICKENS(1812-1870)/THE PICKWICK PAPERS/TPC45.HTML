SAMUEL WELLER AND A FAMILY PARTY. MR. PICKWICK MAKES A TOUR OF THE DIMINUTIVE
WORLD HE INHABITS, AND RESOLVES TO MIX WITH IT, IN FUTURE, AS LITTLE AS
POSSIBLE</FONT></CENTER>


<P>A <FONT SIZE=-1>FEW</FONT> mornings after his incarceration, Mr. Samuel
Weller, having arranged his master's room with all possible care, and seen
him comfortably seated over his books and papers, withdrew to employ himself
for an hour or two to come, as he best could. It was a fine morning, and
it occurred to Sam that a pint of porter in the open air would lighten
his next quarter of an hour or so, as well as any little amusement in which
he could indulge.

<P>Having arrived at this conclusion, he betook himself to the tap. Having
purchased the beer, and obtained, moreover, the day-but-one-before-yesterday's
paper, he repaired to the skittle-ground, and seating himself on a bench,
proceeded to enjoy himself in a very sedate and methodical manner.

<P>First of all, he took a refreshing draught of the beer, and then he
looked up at a window, and bestowed a Platonic wink on a young lady who
was peeling potatoes thereat. Then he opened the paper, and folded it so
as to get the police reports outwards; and this being a vexatious and difficult
thing to do, when there is any wind stirring, he took another draught of
the beer when he had accomplished it. Then, he read two lines of the paper,
and stopped short, to look at a couple of men who were finishing a game
at rackets, which being concluded, he cried out "wery good" in an approving
manner, and looked round upon the spectators, whether their sentiments
coincided with his own. This involved the necessity of looking up at the
windows also; and as the young lady was still there, it was an act of common
politeness to wink again, and to drink to her good health in dumb show,
in another draught of the beer, which Sam did; and having frowned hideously
upon a small boy who had noted this latter proceeding with open eyes, he
threw one leg over the other, and, holding the newspaper in both hands,
began to read in real earnest.

<P>He had hardly composed himself into the needful state of abstraction,
when he thought he heard his own name proclaimed in some distant passage.
Nor was he mistaken, for it quickly passed from mouth to mouth, and in
a few seconds the air teemed with shouts of "Weller!"

<P>"Here!" roared Sam, in a stentorian voice. "Wot's the matter? Who wants
him? Has an express come to say that his country-house is a-fire?"

<P>"Somebody wants you in the hall," said a man who was standing by.

<P>"Just mind that 'ere paper and the pot, old feller, will you?" said
Sam. "I'm a comin'. Blessed, if they was a callin' me to the bar, they
couldn't make more noise about it!"

<P>Accompanying these words with a gentle rap on the head of the young
gentleman before noticed, who, unconscious of his close vicinity to the
person in request, was screaming "Weller!" with all his might, Sam hastened
across the ground, and ran up the steps into the hall. Here, the first
object that met his eyes was his beloved father sitting on a bottom stair,
with his hat in his hand, shouting out "Weller!" in his very loudest tone,
at half-minute intervals.

<P>"Wot are you roarin' at?" said Sam impetuously, when the old gentleman
had discharged himself of another shout; "makin' yourself so precious hot
that you looks like a aggrawated glass-blower. Wot's the matter?"

<P>"Aha!" replied the old gentleman, "I began to be afeerd that you'd gone
for a walk round the Regency Park, Sammy."

<P>"Come," said Sam, "none o' them taunts agin the wictim o' avarice, and
come off that 'ere step. Wot are you a settin' down there for? I don't
live there."

<P>"I've got such a game for you, Sammy," said the elder Mr. Weller, rising.

<P>"Stop a minit," said Sam, "you're all vite behind."

<P>"That's right, Sammy, rub it off," said Mr. Weller, as his son dusted
him. "It might look personal here, if a man walked about with whitevash
on his clothes, eh, Sammy?"

<P>As Mr. Weller exhibited in this place unequivocal symptoms of an approaching
fit of chuckling, Sam interposed to stop it.

<P>"Keep quiet, do," said Sam, "there never vos such a old picter-card
born. Wot are you bustin' vith, now?"

<P>"Sammy," said Mr. Weller, wiping his forehead, "I'm afeerd that vun
o' these days I shall laugh myself into a appleplexy, my boy."

<P>"Vell, then, wot do you do it for?" said Sam. "Now; wot have you got
to say?"

<P>"Who do you think's come here with me, Samivel?" said Mr. Weller, drawing
back a pace or two, pursing up his mouth, and extending his eyebrows.

<P>"Pell?" said Sam.

<P>Mr. Weller shook his head, and his red cheek expanded with the laughter
that was endeavouring to find a vent.

<P>"Mottled-faced man, p'r'aps?" suggested Sam.

<P>Again Mr. Weller shook his head.

<P>"Who then?" asked Sam.

<P>"Your mother-in-law," said Mr. Weller; and it was lucky he did say it,
or his cheeks must inevitably have cracked, from their most unnatural distension.

<P>"Your mother-in-law, Sammy," said Mr. Weller, "and the red-nosed man,
my boy; and the red-nosed man. Ho! ho! ho!"

<P>With this, Mr. Weller launched into convulsions of laughter, while Sam
regarded him with a broad grin gradually overspreading his whole countenance.

<P>"They've come to have a little serious talk with you, Samivel," said
Mr. Weller, wiping his eyes. "Don't let out nothin' about the unnat'ral
creditor, Sammy."

<P>"Wot, don't they know who it is?" inquired Sam.

<P>"Not a bit on it," replied his father.

<P>"Vere are they?" said Sam, reciprocating all the old gentleman's grins.

<P>"In the snuggery," rejoined Mr. Weller. "Catch the red-nosed man a goin'
any vere but vere the liquors is; not he, Samivel, not he. Ve'd a wery
pleasant ride along the road from the Markis this mornin', Sammy," said
Mr. Weller, when he felt himself equal to the task of speaking in an articulate
manner. "I drove the old piebald in that 'ere little shay-cart as belonged
to your mother-in-law's first wenter, into vich a harm-cheer wos lifted
for the shepherd; and I'm blest," said Mr. Weller, with a look of deep
scorn: "I'm blest if they didn't bring a protable flight o' steps out into
the road a front o' our door, for him to get up by."

<P>"You don't mean that?" said Sam.

<P>"I <I>do</I> mean that, Sammy," replied his father, "and I vish you
could ha' seen how tight he held on by the sides wen he did get up, as
if he wos afeerd o' being precipitayted down full six foot, and dashed
into a million o' hatoms. He tumbled in at last, however, and avay he vent;
and I rayther think, I say I rayther think, Samivel, that he found his-self
a little jolted wen ve turned the corners."

<P>"Wot, I s'pose you happened to drive up agin a post or two?" said Sam.

<P>"I'm afeerd," replied Mr. Weller, in a rapture of winks, "I'm afeerd
I took vun or two on 'em, Sammy; he wos a flyin' out o' the harm-cheer
all the way."

<P>Here the old gentleman shook his head from side to side, and was seized
with a hoarse internal rumbling, accompanied with a violent swelling of
the countenance, and a sudden increase in the breadth of all his features;
symptoms which alarmed his son not a little.

<P>"Don't be frightened, Sammy, don't be frightened," said the old gentleman,
when, by dint of much struggling, and various convulsive stamps upon the
ground, he had recovered his voice. "It's only a kind o' quiet laugh as
I'm a tryin' to come, Sammy."

<P>"Well, if that's wot it is," said Sam, "you'd better not try to come
it agin. You'll find it rayther a dangerous inwention."

<P>"Don't you like it, Sammy?" inquired the old gentleman.

<P>"Not at all," replied Sam.

<P>"Well," said Mr. Weller, with the tears still running down his cheeks,
"it 'ud ha' been a wery great accommodation to me if I could ha' done it,
and 'ud ha' saved a good many vords atween your mother-in-law and me, sometimes;
but I am afeerd you're right, Sammy: it's too much in the appleplexy line--a
deal too much, Samivel."

<P>This conversation brought them to the door of the snuggery, into which
Sam--pausing for an instant to look over his shoulder, and cast a sly leer
at his respected progenitor, who was still giggling behind--at once led
the way.

<P>"Mother-in-law," said Sam, politely saluting the lady, "wery much obliged
to you for this here wisit. Shepherd, how air you?"

<P>"Oh, Samuel!" said Mrs. Weller. "This is dreadful."

<P>"Not a bit on it, mum," replied Sam. "Is it, shepherd?"

<P>Mr. Stiggins raised his hands, and turned up his eyes, till the whites--or
rather the yellows--were alone visible; but made no reply in words.

<P>"Is this here gen'l'm'n troubled vith any painful complaint?" said Sam,
looking to his mother-in-law for explanation.

<P>"The good man is grieved to see you here, Samuel," replied Mrs. Weller.

<P>"Oh, that's it, is it?" said Sam. "I was afeerd, from his manner, that
he might ha' forgotten to take pepper vith that 'ere last cowcumber he
eat. Set down, sir; ve make no extra charge for the settin' down, as the
king remarked wen he blowed up his ministers."

<P>"Young man," said Mr. Stiggins, ostentatiously, "I fear you are not
softened by imprisonment."

<P>"Beg you pardon, sir," replied Sam; "wot wos you graciously pleased
to hobserve?"

<P>"I apprehend, young man, that your nature is no softer for this chastening,"
said Mr. Stiggins, in a loud voice.

<P>"Sir," replied Sam, "you're wery kind to say so. I hope my natur is
<I>not</I> a soft vun, sir. Wery much obliged to you for your good opinion,
sir."

<P>At this point of the conversation, a sound, indecorously approaching
to a laugh, was heard to proceed from the chair in which the elder Mr.
Weller was seated; upon which Mrs. Weller, on a hasty consideration of
all the circumstances of the case, considered it her bounden duty to become
gradually hysterical.

<P>"Weller," said Mrs. W. (the old gentleman was seated in a corner); "Weller!
Come forth."

<P>"Wery much obleeged to you, my dear," replied Mr. Weller; "but I'm quite
comfortable vere I am."

<P>Upon this, Mrs. Weller burst into tears.

<P>"Wot's gone wrong, mum?" said Sam.

<P>"Oh, Samuel!" replied Mrs. Weller, "your father makes me wretched. Will
nothing do him good?"

<P>"Do you hear this here?" said Sam. "Lady wants to know vether nothin'
'ull do you good."

<P>"Wery much indebted to Mrs. Weller for her po-lite inquiries, Sammy,"
replied the old gentleman. "I think a pipe vould benefit me a good deal.
Could I be accommodated, Sammy?"

<P>Here Mrs. Weller let fall some more tears, and Mr. Stiggins groaned.

<P>"Hallo! Here's this unfort'nate gen'l'm'n took ill again," said Sam,
looking round. "Were do you feel it now, sir?"

<P>"In the same place, young man," rejoined Mr. Stiggins: "in the same
place."

<P>"Were may that be, sir?" inquired Sam, with great outward simplicity.

<P>"In the buzzim, young man," replied Mr. Stiggins, placing his umbrella
on his waistcoat.

<P>At this affecting reply, Mrs. Weller, being wholly unable to suppress
her feelings, sobbed aloud, and stated her conviction that the red-nosed
man was a saint; whereupon Mr. Weller, senior, ventured to suggest, in
an undertone, that he must be the representative of the united parishes
of Saint Simon Without, and Saint Walker Within.

<P>"I'm afeerd, mum," said Sam, "that this here gen'l'm'n, with the twist
in his countenance, feels rayther thirsty, with the melancholy spectacle
afore him. Is it the case, mum?"

<P>The worthy lady looked at Mr. Stiggins for a reply; that gentleman,
with many rollings of the eye, clenched his throat with his right hand,
and mimicked the act of swallowing, to intimate that he was athirst.

<P>"I am afraid, Samuel, that his feelings have made him so, indeed," said
Mrs. Weller, mournfully.

<P>"Wot's your usual tap, sir," replied Sam.

<P>"Oh, my dear young friend," replied Mr. Stiggins, "all taps is vanities!"

<P>"Too true, too true, indeed," said Mrs. Weller, murmuring a groan, and
shaking her head assentingly.

<P>"Well," said Sam, "I des-say they may be, sir; but which is your partickler
wanity. Vich wanity do you like the flavour on best, sir?"

<P>"Oh, my dear young friend," replied Mr. Stiggins, "I despise them all.
If," said Mr. Stiggins, "if there is any one of them less odious than another,
it is the liquor called rum. Warm, my dear young friend, with three lumps
of sugar to the tumbler."

<P>"Wery sorry to say, sir," said Sam, "that they don't allow that partickler
wanity to be sold in this here establishment."

<P>"Oh, the hardness of heart of these inveterate men!" ejaculated Mr.
Stiggins. "Oh, the accursed cruelty of these inhuman persecutors!"

<P>With these words, Mr. Stiggins again cast up his eyes, and rapped his
breast with his umbrella; and it is but justice to the reverend gentleman
to say, that his indignation appeared very real and unfeigned indeed.

<P>After Mrs. Weller and the red-nosed gentleman had commented on this
inhuman usage in a very forcible manner, and had vented a variety of pious
and holy execrations against its authors, the latter recommended a bottle
of port wine, warmed with a little water, spice, and sugar, as being grateful
to the stomach, and savouring less of vanity than many other compounds.
It was accordingly ordered to be prepared. Pending its preparation the
red-nosed man and Mrs. Weller looked at the elder W. and groaned.

<P>"Well, Sammy," said that gentleman, "I hope you'll find your spirits
rose by this here lively wisit. Wery cheerful and improvin' conwersation,
ain't it, Sammy?"

<P>"You're a reprobate," replied Sam; "and I desire you won't address no
more o' them ungraceful remarks to me."

<P>So far from being edified by this very proper reply, the elder Mr. Weller
at once relapsed into a broad grin; and this inexorable conduct causing
the lady and Mr. Stiggins to close their eyes, and rock themselves to and
fro on their chairs, in a troubled manner, he furthermore indulged in several
acts of pantomime, indicative of a desire to pummel and wring the nose
of the aforesaid Stiggins: the performance of which appeared to afford
him great mental relief. The old gentleman very narrowly escaped detection
in one instance; for Mr. Stiggins happening to give a start on the arrival
of the negus, brought his head in smart contact with the clenched fist
with which Mr. Weller had been describing imaginary fireworks in the air,
within two inches of his ear, for some minutes.

<P>"Wot are you a reachin' out your hand for the tumbler in that 'ere sawage
way for?" said Sam, with great promptitude. "Don't you see you've hit the
gen'l'm'n?"

<P>"I didn't go to do it, Sammy," said Mr. Weller, in some degree abashed
by the very unexpected occurrence of the incident.

<P>"Try an in'ard application, sir," said Sam, as the red-nosed gentleman
rubbed his head with a rueful visage. "Wot do you think o' that, for a
go o' wanity warm, sir?"

<P>Mr. Stiggins made no verbal answer, but his manner was expressive. he
tasted the contents of the glass which Sam had placed in his hand; put
his umbrella on the floor, and tasted it again: passing his hand placidly
across his stomach twice of thrice; he then drank the whole at a breath,
and smacking his lips, held out the tumbler for more.

<P>Nor was Mrs. Weller behind-hand in doing justice to the composition.
The good lady began by protesting that she couldn't touch a drop--then
took a small drop--then a large drop--then a great many drops; and her
feelings being of the nature of those substances which are powerfully affected
by the application of strong waters, she dropped a tear with every drop
of negus, and so got on, melting the feelings down, until at length she
had arrived at a very pathetic and decent pitch of misery.

<P>The elder Mr. Weller observed these signs and tokens with many manifestations
of disgust, and when, after a second jug of the same, Mr. Stiggins began
to sigh in a dismal manner, he plainly evinced his disapprobation of the
whole proceedings, by sundry incoherent ramblings of speech, among which
frequent angry repetitions of the word "gammon" were alone distinguishable
to the ear.

<P>"I'll tell you wot it is, Samivel, my boy," whispered the old gentleman
into his son's ear, after a long and steadfast contemplation of his lady
and Mr. Stiggins; "I think there must be somethin' wrong in your mother-in-law's
inside, as vell as in that o' the red-nosed man."

<P>"Wot do you mean?" said Sam.

<P>"I mean this here, Sammy," replied the old gentleman, "that wot they
drink, don't seem no nourishment to 'em; it all turns to warm water, and
comes a' pourin' out o' their eyes. 'Pend upon it, Sammy, it's a constitootional
infirmity."

<P>Mr. Weller delivered this scientific opinion with many confirmatory
frowns and nods; which, Mrs. Weller remarking, and concluding that they
bore some disparaging reference either to herself or to Mr. Stiggins, or
to both, was on the point of becoming infinitely worse, when Mr. Stiggins,
getting on his legs as well as he could, proceeded to deliver an edifying
discourse for the benefit of the company, but more especially of Mr. Samuel,
whom he adjured in moving terms to be upon his guard in that sink of iniquity
into which he was cast; to abstain from all hypocrisy and pride of heart;
and to take in all things exact pattern and copy by him (Stiggins), in
which case he might calculate on arriving, sooner or later at the comfortable
conclusion, that, like him, he was a most estimable and blameless character,
and that all his acquaintance and friends were hopelessly abandoned and
profligate wretches. Which consideration, he said, could not but afford
him the liveliest satisfaction.

<P>He furthermore conjured him to avoid, above all things, the vice of
intoxication, which he likened unto the filthy habits of swine, and to
those poisonous and baleful drugs which being chewed in the mouth, are
said to filch away the memory. At this point of his discourse, the reverend
and red-nosed gentleman became singularly incoherent, and staggering to
and fro in the excitement of his eloquence, was fain to catch at the back
of a chair to preserve his perpendicular.

<P>Mr. Stiggins did not desire his hearers to be upon their guard against
those false prophets and wretched mockers of religion, who, without sense
to expound its first doctrines, or hearts to feel its first principles,
are more dangerous members of society than the common criminal; imposing,
as they necessarily do, upon the weakest and worst informed, casting scorn
and contempt on what should be held most sacred, and bringing into partial
disrepute large bodies of virtuous and well-conducted persons of many excellent
sects and persuasions. But as he leant over the back of the chair for a
considerable time, and closing one eye, winked a good deal with the other,
it is presumed that he thought all this, but kept it to himself.

<P>During the delivery of the oration, Mrs. Weller sobbed and wept at the
end of the paragraphs: while Sam, sitting cross-legged on a chair and resting
his arms on the top-rail, regarded the speaker with great suavity and blandness
of demeanour; occasionally bestowing a look of recognition on the old gentleman,
who was delighted at the beginning, and went to sleep about half-way.

<P>"Brayvo; wery pretty!" said Sam, when the red-nosed man having finished,
pulled his worn gloves on: thereby thrusting his fingers through the broken
tops till the knuckles were disclosed to view. "Wery pretty."

<P>"I hope it may do you good, Samuel," said Mrs. Weller solemnly.

<P>"I think it vill, mum," replied Sam.

<P>"I wish I could hope that it would do your father good," said Mrs. Weller.

<P>"Thank'ee, my dear," said Mr. Weller, senior. "How do <I>you</I> find
yourself arter it, my love?"

<P>"Scoffer!" exclaimed Mrs. Weller.

<P>"Benighted man!" said the reverend Mr. Stiggins.

<P>"If I don't get no better light than that 'ere moonshine o' yourn, my
worthy creetur," said the elder Mr. Weller, "it's wery likely as I shall
continey to be a night coach till I'm took off the road altogether. Now,
Mrs. We, if the piebald stands at livery much longer, he'll stand at nothin'
as we go back, and p'raps that 'ere harm cheer 'ull be tipped over into
some hedge or another, with the shepherd in it."

<P>At this supposition, the reverend Mr. Stiggins, in evident consternation,
gathered up his hat and umbrella, and proposed an immediate departure,
to which Mrs. Weller assented. Sam walked with them to the lodge-gate,
and took a dutiful leave.

<P>"A-do, Samivel," said the old gentleman.

<P>"Wot's a-do?" inquired Sammy.

<P>"Well, good-bye, then," said the old gentleman.

<P>"Oh, that's wot you're a aimin' at, is it?" said Sam. "Good-bye!"

<P>"Sammy," whispered Mr. Weller, looking cautiously round; "my duty to
your gov'ner, and tell him if he thinks better o' this here bis'ness, to
commoonicate vith me. Me and a cab'net-maker has dewised a plan for gettin'
him out. A pianner, Samivel, a pianner!" said Mr. Weller, striking his
son on the chest with the back of his hand, and falling back a step or
two.

<P>"Wot do you mean?" said Sam.

<P>"A pianner forty, Samivel," rejoined Mr. Weller, in a still more mysterious
manner, "as he can have on hire; vun as von't play, Sammy."

<P>"And wot'ud be the good o' that?" said Sam.

<P>"Let him send to my friend, the cab'net-maker, to fetch it back, Sammy,"
replied Mr. Weller. "Are you avake, now?"

<P>"No," rejoined Sam.

<P>"There ain't no vurks in it," whispered his father. "It 'ull hold him
easy, vith his hat and shoes on, and breathe through the legs, vich his
holler. Have a passage ready taken for 'Merriker. The 'Merrikin gov'ment
will never give him up, ven they find as he's got money to spend, Sammy.
Let the gov'ner stop there, till Mrs. Bardell's dead, or Mr. Dodson and
Fogg's hung (wich last ewent I think is the most likely to happen first,
Sammy), and then let him come back and write a book about the 'Merrikins
as'll pay all his expenses and more, if he blows 'em up enough."

<P>Mr. Weller delivered this hurried abstract of his plot with great vehemence
of whisper; then, as if fearful of weakening the effect of the tremendous
communication, by any further dialogue, he gave the coachman's salute,
and vanished.

<P>Sam had scarcely recovered his usual composure of countenance, which
had been greatly disturbed by the secret communication of his respected
relative, when Mr. Pickwick accosted him.

<P>"Sam," said that gentleman.

<P>"Sir," replied Mr. Weller.

<P>"I am going for a walk round the prison, and I wish you to attend me.
I see a prisoner we know coming this way, Sam," said Mr. Pickwick, smiling.

<P>"Wich, sir?" inquired Mr. Weller; "the gen'l'm'n vith the head o' hair,
or the interestin' captive in the stockin's?"

<P>"Neither," rejoined Mr. Pickwick. "He is an older friend of yours, Sam."

<P>"O' mine, sir?" exclaimed Mr. Weller.

<P>"You recollect the gentleman very well, I daresay, Sam," replied Mr.
Pickwick, "or else you are more unmindful of your old acquaintances than
I think you are. Hush! not a word, Sam; not a syllable. Here he is."

<P>As Mr. Pickwick spoke, Jingle walked up. He looked less miserable than
before, being clad in a half-worn suit of clothes, which, with Mr. Pickwick's
assistance, had been released from the pawnbroker's. He wore clean linen
too, and had had his hair cut. He was very pale and thin, however; and
as he crept slowly up, leaning on a stick, it was easy to see that he had
suffered severely from illness and want, and was still very weak. He took
off his hat as Mr. Pickwick saluted him, and seemed much humbled and abashed
at sight of Sam Weller.

<P>Following close at his heels, came Mr. Job Trotter, in the catalogue
of whose vices, want of faith and attachment to his companion could at
all events find no place. He was still ragged and squalid, but his face
was not quite so hollow as on his first meeting with Mr. Pickwick, a few
days before. As he took off his hat to our benevolent old friend, he murmured
some broken expressions of gratitude, and muttered something about having
been saved from starving.

<P>"Well, well," said Mr. Pickwick, impatiently interrupting him, "you
can follow with Sam. I want to speak to you, Mr. Jingle. Can you walk without
his arm?"

<P>"Certainly, sir--all ready--not too fast--legs shaky--head queer--round
and round--earthquaky sort of feeling--very."

<P>"Here, give me your arm," said Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"No, no," replied Jingle; "won't indeed--rather not."

<P>"Nonsense;" said Mr. Pickwick, "lean upon me, I desire, sir."

<P>Seeing that he was confused and agitated, and uncertain what to do,
Mr. Pickwick cut the matter short by drawing the invalided stroller's arm
through his, and leading him away, without saying another word about it.

<P>During the whole of this time, the countenance of Mr. Samuel Weller
had exhibited an expression of the most overwhelming and absorbing astonishment
that the imagination can portray. After looking from Job to Jingle, and
from Jingle to Job in profound silence, he softly ejaculated the words,
"Well, I <I>am</I> damn'd!" Which he repeated at least a score of times:
after which exertion, he appeared wholly bereft of speech, and again cast
his eyes, first upon the one and then upon the other, in mute perplexity
and bewilderment.

<P>"Now, Sam!" said Mr. Pickwick, looking back.

<P>"I'm a comin', sir," replied Mr. Weller, mechanically following his
master; and still he lifted not his eyes from Mr. Job Trotter, who walked
at his side, in silence.

<P>Job kept his eyes fixed on the ground for some time. Sam, with his glued
to Job's countenance, ran up against the people who were walking about,
and fell over little children, and stumbled against steps and railings,
without appearing at all sensible of it, until Job, looking stealthily
up, said:

<P>"How do you do, Mr. Weller?"

<P>"It <I>is</I> him!" exclaimed Sam: and having established Job's identity
beyond all doubt, he smote his leg, and vented his feelings in a long shrill
whistle.

<P>"Things has altered with me, sir," said Job.

<P>"I should think they had," exclaimed Mr. Weller, surveying his companion's
rags with undisguised wonder. "This is rayther a change for the worse,
Mr. Trotter, as the gen'l'm'n said, wen he got two doubtful shillin's and
six-penn'orth o' pocket pieces for a good half-crown."

<P>"It, is indeed," replied Job, shaking his head. "There is no deception
now, Mr. Weller. Tears," said Job, with a look of momentary slyness, "tears
are not the only proofs of distress, nor the best ones."

<P>"No, they ain't," replied Sam, expressively.

<P>"They may be put on, Mr. Weller," said Job.

<P>"I know they may," said Sam; "some people, indeed, has 'em always ready
laid on, and can pull out the plug wenever they likes."

<P>"Yes," replied Job; "but <I>these</I> sort of things are not so easily
counterfeited, Mr. Weller, and it is a more painful process to get them
up." As he spoke, he pointed to his sallow sunken cheeks, and, drawing
up his coat sleeves, disclosed an arm which looked as if the bone could
be broken at a touch: so sharp and brittle did it appear, beneath its thin
covering of flesh.

<P>"Wot have you been a doin' to yourself?" said Sam, recoiling.

<P>"Nothing," replied Job.

<P>"Nothin'!" echoed Sam.

<P>"I have been doin' nothing for many weeks past," said Job; "and eating
and drinking almost as little."

<P>Sam took one comprehensive glance at Mr. Trotter's thin face and wretched
apparel; and then, seizing him by the arm, commenced dragging him away
with great violence.

<P>"Where are you going, Mr. Weller?" said Job, vainly struggling in the
powerful grasp of his old enemy.

<P>"Come on," said Sam; "come on!" He deigned no further explanation until
they reached the tap; and then called for a pot of porter, which was speedily
produced.

<P>"Now," said Sam, "drink that up, ev'ry drop on it, and then turn the
pot upside down, to let me see as you've took the med'cine."

<P>"But, my dear Mr. Weller," remonstrated Job.

<P>"Down vith it!" said Sam, peremptorily.

<P>Thus admonished, Mr. Trotter raised the pot to his lips, and, by gentle
and almost imperceptible degrees, tilted it into the air. He paused once,
and only once, to draw a long breath, but without raising his face from
the vessel, which, in a few moments thereafter, he held out at arm's length,
bottom upward. Nothing fell upon the ground but a few particles of froth,
which slowly detached themselves from the rim, and trickled lazily down.

<P>"Well done!" said Sam. "How do you find yourself arter it?"

<P>"Better, sir. I think I am better," responded Job.

<P>"O' course you air," said Sam, argumentatively. "It's like puttin' gas
in a balloon. I can see with the naked eye that you gets stouter under
the operation. Wot do you say to another o' the same di-mensions?"

<P>"I would rather not, I am much obliged to you, sir," replied Job, "much
rather not."

<P>"Vell, then, wot do you say to some wittles?" inquired Sam.

<P>"Thanks to your worthy governor, sir," said Mr. Trotter, "we have half
a leg of mutton, baked, at a quarter before three, with the potatoes under
it to save boiling."

<P>"Wot! Has <I>he</I> been a purwidin' for you?" asked Sam, emphatically.

<P>"He has, sir," replied Job. "More than that, Mr. Weller; my master being
very ill, he got us a room--we were in a kennel before--and paid for it,
sir; and come to look at us, at night, when nobody should know. Mr. Weller,"
said Job, with real tears in his eyes, for once, "I could serve that gentleman
till I fell down dead at his feet."

<P>"I say!" said Sam, "I'll trouble you, my friend! None o' that!"

<P>Job Trotter looked amazed.

<P>"None o' that, I say, young feller," repeated Sam, firmly. "No man serves
him but me. And now we're upon it, I'll let you into another secret besides
that," said Sam, as he paid for the beer. "I never heerd, mind you, nor
read of in story-books, nor see in picters, any angel in tights and gaiters--not
even in spectacles, as I remember, though that may ha' been done for anythin'
I know to the contrairey--but mark my vords, Job Trotter, he's a reg'lar
thorough-bred angel for all that; and let me see the man as wenturs to
tell me he knows a better vun." With this defiance, Mr. Weller buttoned
up his change in a side pocket, and, with many confirmatory nods and gestures
by the way, proceeded in search of the subject of discourse.

<P>They found Mr. Pickwick, in company with Jingle, talking very earnestly,
and not bestowing a look on the groups who were congregated on the racket-ground;
they were very motley groups too, and worth the looking at, if it were
only in idle curiosity.

<P>"Well," said Mr. Pickwick, as Sam and his companion drew nigh, "you
will see how your health becomes, and think about it meanwhile. Make the
statement out for me when you feel yourself equal to the task, and I will
discuss the subject with you when I have considered it. Now, go to your
room. You are tired, and not strong enough to be out long."

<P>Mr. Alfred Jingle, without one spark of his old animation--with nothing
even of the dismal gaiety which he had assumed when Mr. Pickwick first
stumbled on him in his misery--bowed low without speaking, and, motioning
to Job not to follow him just yet, crept slowly away.

<P>"Curious scene this, is it not, Sam?" said Mr. Pickwick, looking good-humouredly
round.

<P>"Wery much so, sir," replied Sam. "Wonders 'ull never cease," added
Sam, speaking to himself. "I'm wery much mistaken if that 'ere Jingle worn't
a doin' somethin' in the water-cart way!"

<P>The area formed by the wall in that part of the Fleet in which Mr. Pickwick
stood, was just wide enough to make a good racket-court; one side being
formed, of course, by the wall itself and the other by that portion of
the prison which looked (or rather would have looked, but for the wall)
towards St. Paul's Cathedral. Sauntering or sitting about, in every possible
attitude of listless idleness, were a great number of debtors, the major
part of whom were waiting in prison until their day of "going up" before
the Insolvent Court should arrive; while others had been remanded for various
terms, which they were idling away, as they best could. Some were shabby,
some were smart, many dirty, a few clean; but there they all lounged, and
loitered, and slunk about, with as little spirit or purpose as the beasts
in a menagerie.

<P>Lolling from the windows which commanded a view of this promenade, were
a number of persons, some in noisy conversation with their acquaintance
below, others playing at ball with some adventurous throwers outside, others
looking on at the racket-players, or watching the boys as they cried the
game. Dirty slipshod women passed and re-passed, on their way to the cooking-house
in one corner of the yard; children screamed, and fought, and played together,
in another; the tumbling of the skittles, and the shouts of the players,
mingled perpetually with these and a hundred other sounds; and all was
noise and tumult--save in a little miserable shed a few yards off, where
lay, all quiet and ghastly, the body of the Chancery prisoner who had died
the night before, awaiting the mockery of an inquest. The body! It is the
lawyer's term for the restless whirling mass of cares and anxieties, affections,
hopes, and griefs, that make up the living man. The law <I>had</I> his
body; and there it lay, clothed in grave clothes, an awful witness to its
tender mercy.

<P>"Would you like to see a whistling-shop, sir?" inquired Job Trotter.

<P>"What do you mean?" was Mr. Pickwick's counter inquiry.

<P>"A vistlin' shop, sir," interposed Mr. Weller.

<P>"What is that, Sam? A bird-fancier's?" inquired Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"Bless your heart, no, sir," replied Job; "a whistling-shop, sir, is
where they sell spirits." Mr. Job Trotter briefly explained here, that
all persons, being prohibited under heavy penalties from conveying spirits
into debtors' prisons, and such commodities being highly prized by the
ladies and gentlemen confined therein, it had occurred to some speculative
turnkey to connive, for certain lucrative considerations, at two or three
prisoners retailing the favourite article of gin, for their own profit
and advantage.

<P>"This plan, you see, sir, has been gradually introduced into all the
prisons for debt," said Mr. Trotter.

<P>"And it has this wery great advantage," said Sam, "that the turnkeys
takes wery good care to seize hold o' ev'ry body but them as pays 'em,
that attempt the willainy, and wen it gets in the papers they're applauded
for their wigilance; so it cuts two ways--frightens other people from the
trade, and elewates their own characters."

<P>"Exactly so, Mr. Weller," observed Job.

<P>"Well, but are these rooms never searched, to ascertain whether any
spirits are concealed in them?" said Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"Cert'nly they are, sir," replied Sam; "but the turnkeys knows beforehand,
and gives the word to the wistlers, and you <I>may</I> wistle for it wen
you go to look."

<P>By this time, Job had tapped at a door, which was opened by a gentleman
with an uncombed head, who bolted it after them when they had walked in,
and grinned; upon which Job grinned, and Sam also; whereupon Mr. Pickwick,
thinking it might be expected of him, kept on smiling to the end of the
interview.

<P>The gentleman with the uncombed head appeared quite satisfied with this
mute announcement of their business, and, producing a flat stone bottle,
which might hold about a couple of quarts, from beneath his bedstead, filled
out three glasses of gin, which Job Trotter and Sam disposed of in a most
workmanlike manner.

<P>"Any more?" said the whistling gentleman.

<P>"No more," replied Job Trotter.

<P>Mr. Pickwick paid, the door was unbolted, and out they came; the uncombed
gentleman bestowing a friendly nod upon Mr. Roker, who happened to be passing
at the moment.

<P>From this spot, Mr. Pickwick wandered along all the galleries, up and
down all the staircases, and once again round the whole area of the yard.
The great body of the prison population appeared to be Mivins, and Smangle,
and the parson, and the butcher, and the leg, over and over, and over again.
There were the same squalor, the same turmoil and noise, the same general
characteristics, in every corner; in the best and the worst alike. The
whole place seemed restless and troubled; and the people were crowding
and flitting to and fro, like the shadows in an uneasy dream.

<P>"I have seen enough," said Mr. Pickwick, as he threw himself into a
chair in his little apartment. "My head aches with these scenes, and my
heart too. Henceforth I will be a prisoner in my own room."

<P>And Mr. Pickwick steadfastly adhered to this determination. For three
long months he remained shut up, all day; only stealing out at night to
breathe the air when the greater part of his fellow prisoners were in bed
or carousing in their rooms. His health was beginning to suffer from the
closeness of the confinement, but neither the often-repeated entreaties
of Perker and his friends, nor the still more frequently-repeated warnings
and admonitions of Mr. Samuel Weller, could induce him to alter one jot
of his inflexible resolution.
