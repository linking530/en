<CENTER><FONT SIZE=-1>BRIEFLY ILLUSTRATIVE OF TWO POINTS;--FIRST, THE POWER
OF HYSTERICS, AND, SECONDLY, THE FORCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES</FONT></CENTER>


<P>F<FONT SIZE=-1>OR</FONT> two days after the breakfast at Mrs. Hunter's
the Pickwickians remained at Eatanswill, anxiously awaiting the arrival
of some intelligence from their revered leader. Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass
were once again left to their own means of amusement; for Mr. Winkle, in
compliance with a most pressing invitation, continued to reside at Mr.
Pott's house, and to devote his time to the companionship of his amiable
lady. Nor was the occasional society of Mr. Pott himself, wanting to complete
their felicity. Deeply immersed in the intensity of his speculations for
the public weal and the destruction of the Independent, it was not the
habit of that great man to descend from his mental pinnacle to the humble
level of ordinary minds. On this occasion, however, and as if expressly
in compliment to any follower of Mr. Pickwick's, he unbent, relaxed, stepped
down from his pedestal, and walked upon the ground: benignly adapting his
remarks to the comprehension of the herd, and seeming in outward form,
if not in spirit, to be one of them.

<P>Such having been the demeanour of this celebrated public character towards
Mr. Winkle, it will be readily imagined that considerable surprise was
depicted on the countenance of the latter gentleman, when, as he was sitting
alone in the breakfast-room, the door was hastily thrown open, and as hastily
closed, on the entrance of Mr. Pott, who, stalking majestically towards
him, and thrusting aside his proffered hand, ground his teeth, as if to
put a sharper edge on what he was about to utter, and exclaimed, in a saw-like
voice,--

<P>"Serpent!"

<P>"Sir!" exclaimed Mr. Winkle, starting from his chair.

<P>"Serpent, sir," repeated Mr. Pott, raising his voice, and then suddenly
depressing it; "I said, Serpent, sir--make the most of it."

<P>When you have parted with a man, at two o'clock in the morning, on terms
of the utmost good fellowship, and he meets you again, at half-past nine,
and greets you as a serpent, it is not unreasonable to conclude that something
of an unpleasant nature has occurred meanwhile. So Mr. Winkle thought.
He returned Mr. Pott's gaze of stone, and in compliance with that gentleman's
request, proceeded to make the most he could of the "serpent." The most,
however, was nothing at all; so after a profound silence of some minutes'
duration, he said,--

<P>"Serpent, sir! Serpent, Mr. Pott! What can you mean, sir?--this is pleasantry."

<P>"Pleasantry, sir!" exclaimed Pott, with a motion of the hand, indicative
of a strong desire to hurl the Britannia metal tea-pot at the head of his
visitor. "Pleasantry, sir!--but no, I will be calm; I will be calm, sir;"
in proof of his calmness, Mr. Pott flung himself into a chair, and foamed
at the mouth.

<P>"My dear sir," interposed Mr. Winkle.

<P>"<I>Dear</I> sir!" replied Pott. "How dare you address me, as dear sir,
sir? How dare you look me in the face and do it, sir?"

<P>"Well, sir, if you come to that," responded Mr. Winkle, "how dare you
look <I>me</I> in the face, and call me a serpent, sir?"

<P>"Because you are one," replied Mr. Pott.

<P>"Prove it, sir," said Mr. Winkle, warmly. "Prove it."

<P>A malignant scowl passed over the profound face of the editor, as he
drew from his pocket, the Independent of that morning; and laying his finger
on a particular paragraph, threw the journal across the table to Mr. Winkle.

<P>That gentleman took it up, and read as follows:--

<P>"Our obscure and filthy contemporary, in some disgusting observations
on the recent election for this borough, has presumed to violate the hallowed
sanctity of private life, and to refer, in a manner not to be misunderstood,
to the personal affairs of our late candidates-aye, and notwithstanding
his base defeat, we will add, our future member, Mr. Fizkin. What does
our dastardly contemporary mean? What would the ruffian say, if we, setting
at naught, like him, the decencies of social intercourse, were to raise
the curtain which happily conceals <FONT SIZE=-1>HIS</FONT> private life
from general ridicule, not to say from general execration? What, if we
were even to point out, and comment on, facts and circumstances, which
are publicly notorious, and beheld by every one, but our mole-eyed contemporary--what
if we were to print the following effusion, which we received while we
were writing the commencement of this article, from a talented fellow-townsman
and correspondent!&nbsp;<poem><stanza><l>"`<FONT SIZE=-1>LINES TO A BRASS
POT</FONT>&nbsp;<l>"`Oh, Pott! if you'd known&nbsp;<l>How false she'd have
grown,&nbsp;<l>When you heard the marriage bells tinkle;&nbsp;<l>You'd
have done then, I vow,&nbsp;<l>What you cannot help now,&nbsp;<l>And handed
her over to W<tp>'"&nbsp;</stanza></poem>

<P>"`What," said Mr. Pott, solemnly: "what rhymes to `tinkle,' villain?"

<P>"What rhymes to tinkle?" said Mrs. Pott, whose entrance at the moment
forestalled the reply. "What rhymes to tinkle? Why, Winkle, I should conceive:"
saying this, Mrs. Pott smiled sweetly on the disturbed Pickwickian, and
extended her hand towards him. The agitated young man would have accepted
it, in his confusion, had not Pott indignantly interposed.

<P>"Back, ma'am--back!" said the editor. "Take his hand before my very
face!"

<P>"Mr. P.!" said his astonished lady.

<P>"Wretched woman, look here," exclaimed the husband. "Look here, ma'am--`Lines
to a brass Pot.' `Brass pot';--that's me, ma'am. `False <I>she</I>'d have
grown';--that's you, ma'am--you." With this ebullition of rage, which was
not unaccompanied with something like a tremble, at the expression of his
wife's face, Mr. Pott dashed the current number of the Eatanswill Independent
at her feet.

<P>"Upon my word, sir," said the astonished Mrs. Pott, stooping to pick
up the paper. "Upon my word, sir!"

<P>Mr. Pott winced beneath the contemptuous gaze of his wife. He had made
a desperate struggle to screw up his courage, but it was fast coming unscrewed
again.

<P>There appears nothing very tremendous in this little sentence, "Upon
my word, sir," when it comes to be read; but the tone of voice in which
it was delivered, and the look that accompanied it, both seeming to bear
reference to some revenge to be thereafter visited upon the head of Pott,
produced their full effect upon him. The most unskilful observer could
have detected in his troubled countenance, a readiness to resign his Wellington
boots to any efficient substitute who would have consented to stand in
them at that moment.

<P>Mrs. Pott read the paragraph, uttered a loud shriek, and threw herself
at full length on the hearth-rug, screaming, and tapping it with the heels
of her shoes, in a manner which could leave no doubt of the propriety of
her feelings on the occasion.

<P>"My dear," said the petrified Pott,--"I didn't say I believed it;--I--"
but the unfortunate man's voice was drowned in the screaming of his partner.

<P>"Mrs. Pott, let me entreat you, my dear ma'am, to compose yourself,"
said Mr. Winkle; but the shrieks and tappings were louder, and more frequent
than ever.

<P>"My dear," said Mr. Pott, "I'm very sorry. If you won't consider your
own health, consider me, my dear. We shall have a crowd round the house."
But the more strenuously Mr. Pott entreated, the more vehemently the screams
poured forth.

<P>Very fortunately, however, attached to Mrs. Pott's person was a body-guard
of one, a young lady whose ostensible employment was to preside over her
toilet, but who rendered herself useful in a variety of ways, and in none
more so than in the particular department of constantly aiding and abetting
her mistress in every wish and inclination opposed to the desires of the
unhappy Pott. The screams reached this young lady's ears in due course,
and brought her into the room with a speed which threatened to derange,
materially, the very exquisite arrangement of her cap and ringlets.

<P>"Oh, my dear, dear mistress!" exclaimed the body-guard, kneeling frantically
by the side of the prostrate Mrs. Pott. "Oh, my dear mistress, what is
the matter?"

<P>"Your master--your brutal master," murmured the patient.

<P>Pott was evidently giving way.

<P>"It's a shame," said the body-guard, reproachfully. "I know he'll be
the death of you, ma'am. Poor dear thing!"

<P>He gave way more. The opposite party followed up the attack.

<P>"Oh don't leave me--don't leave me, Goodwin," murmured Mrs. Pott, clutching
at the wrist of the said Goodwin with an hysteric jerk. "You're the only
person that's kind to me, Goodwin."

<P>At this affecting appeal, Goodwin got up a little domestic tragedy of
her own, and shed tears copiously.

<P>"Never, ma'am--never," said Goodwin. "Oh, sir, you should be careful--you
should indeed; you don't know what harm you may do missis; you'll be sorry
for it one day, I know--I've always said so."

<P>The unlucky Pott looked timidly on, but said nothing.

<P>"Goodwin," said Mrs. Pott, in a soft voice.

<P>"Ma'am," said Goodwin.

<P>"If you only knew how I have loved that man--"

<P>"Don't distress yourself by recollecting it, ma'am," said the body-guard.

<P>Pott looked very frightened. It was time to finish him.

<P>"And now," sobbed Mrs. Pott, "now, after all, to be treated in this
way; to be reproached and insulted in the presence of a third party, and
that party almost a stranger. But I will not submit to it! Goodwin," continued
Mrs. Pott, raising herself in the arms of her attendant, "my brother, the
Lieutenant, shall interfere. I'll be separated, Goodwin!"

<P>"It would certainly serve him right, ma'am," said Goodwin.

<P>Whatever thoughts the threat of a separation might have awakened in
Mr. Pott's mind, he forbore to give utterance to them, and contented himself
by saying, with great humility:

<P>"My dear, will you hear me?"

<P>A fresh train of sobs was the only reply, as Mrs. Pott grew more hysterical,
requested to be informed why she was ever born, and required sundry other
pieces of information of a similar description.

<P>"My dear," remonstrated Mr. Pott, "do not give way to these sensitive
feelings. I never believed that the paragraph had any foundation, my dear--impossible.
I was only angry, my dear--I may say outrageous--with the Independent people
for daring to insert it; that's all:" Mr. Pott cast an imploring look at
the innocent cause of the mischief, as if to entreat him to say nothing
about the serpent.

<P>"And what steps, sir, do you mean to take to obtain redress?" inquired
Mr. Winkle, gaining courage as he saw Pott losing it.

<P>"Oh, Goodwin," observed Mrs. Pott, "does he mean to horsewhip the editor
of the Independent--does he, Goodwin?"

<P>"Hush, hush, ma'am; pray keep yourself quiet," replied the body-guard.
"I daresay he will, if you wish it, ma'am."

<P>"Certainly," said Pott, as his wife evinced decided symptoms of going
off again. "Of course I shall."

<P>"When, Goodwin--when?" said Mrs. Pott, still undecided about the going
off.

<P>"Immediately, of course," said Mr. Pott; "before the day is out."

<P>"Oh, Goodwin," resumed Mrs. Pott, "it's the only way of meeting the
slander, and setting me right with the world."

<P>"Certainly, ma'am," replied Goodwin. "No man as is a man, ma'am, could
refuse to do it."

<P>So, as the hysterics were still hovering about, Mr. Pott said once more
that he would do it; but Mrs. Pott was so overcome at the bare idea of
having ever been suspected, that she was half-a-dozen times on the very
verge of a relapse, and most unquestionably would have gone off, had it
not been for the indefatigable efforts of the assiduous Goodwin, and repeated
entreaties for pardon from the conquered Pott; and finally, when that unhappy
individual had been frightened and snubbed down to his proper level, Mrs.
Pott recovered, and they went to breakfast.

<P>"You will not allow this base newspaper slander to shorten your stay
here, Mr. Winkle?" said Mrs. Pott, smiling through the traces of her tears.

<P>"I hope not," said Mr. Pott, actuated, as he spoke, by a wish that his
visitor would choke himself with the morsel of dry toast which he was raising
to his lips at the moment: and so terminate his stay effectually.

<P>"I hope not."

<P>"You are very good," said Mr. Winkle; "but a letter has been received
from Mr. Pickwick-so I learn by a note from Mr. Tupman, which was brought
up to my bed-room door, this morning--in which he requests us to join him
at Bury to-day; and we are to leave by the coach at noon."

<P>"But you will come back?" said Mrs. Pott.

<P>"Oh, certainly," replied Mr. Winkle.

<P>"You are quite sure?" said Mrs. Pott, stealing a tender look at her
visitor.

<P>"Quite," responded Mr. Winkle.

<P>The breakfast passed off in silence, for each member of the party was
brooding over his, or her, own personal grievances. Mrs. Pott was regretting
the loss of a beau; Mr. Pott his rash pledge to horsewhip the Independent;
Mr. Winkle his having innocently placed himself in so awkward a situation.
Noon approached, and after many adieux and promises to return, he tore
himself away.

<P><pp>If he ever comes back, I'll poison him," thought Mr. Pott, as he
turned into the little back office where he prepared his thunderbolts.

<P>"If I ever do come back, and mix myself up with these people again,"
thought Mr. Winkle, as he wended his way to the Peacock, "I shall deserve
to be horsewhipped myself--that's all."

<P>His friends were ready, the coach was nearly so, and in half-an-hour
they were proceeding on their journey, along the road over which Mr. Pickwick
and Sam had so recently travelled, and of which, as we have already said
something, we do not feel called upon to extract Mr. Snodgrass's poetical
and beautiful description.

<P>Mr. Weller was standing at the door of the Angel, ready to receive them,
and by that gentleman they were ushered to the apartment of Mr. Pickwick,
where, to the no small surprise of Mr. Winkle and Mr. Snodgrass, and the
no small embarrassment of Mr. Tupman, they found old Wardle and Trundle.

<P>"How are you?" said the old man, grasping Mr. Tupman's hand. "Don't
hang back, or look sentimental about it; it can't be helped, old fellow.
For her sake, I wish you'd had her; for your own, I'm very glad you have
not. A young fellow like you will do better one of these days--eh?" With
this consolation, Wardle slapped Mr. Tupman on the back, and laughed heartily.

<P>"Well, and how are you, my fine fellows?" said the old gentleman, shaking
hands with Mr. Winkle and Mr. Snodgrass at the same time. "I have just
been telling Pickwick that we must have you all down at Christmas. We're
going to have a wedding--a real wedding this time."

<P>"A wedding!" exclaimed Mr. Snodgrass, turning very pale.

<P>"Yes, a wedding. But don't be frightened," said the good-humoured old
man; "it's only Trundle there, and Bella."

<P>"Oh, is that all!" said Mr. Snodgrass, relieved from a painful doubt
which had fallen heavily on his breast. "Give you joy, sir. How is Joe?"

<P>"Very well," replied the old gentleman. "Sleepy as ever."

<P>"And your mother, and the clergyman, and all of 'em?"

<P>"Quite well."

<P>"Where," said Mr. Tupman, with an effort--"where is--<I>she</I>, sir?"
and he turned away his head, and covered his eyes with his hand.

<P>"<I>She</I>!" said the old gentleman, with a knowing shake of the head.
"Do you mean my single relative--eh?"

<P>Mr. Tupman, by a nod, intimated that his question applied to the disappointed
Rachael.

<P>"Oh, she's gone away," said the old gentleman. "She's living at a relation's,
far enough off. She couldn't bear to see the girls, so I let her go. But
come! Here's the dinner. You must be hungry after your ride. <I>I</I> am,
without any ride at all; so let us fall to."

<P>Ample justice was done to the meal; and when they were seated round
the table, after it had been disposed of, Mr. Pickwick, to the intense
horror and indignation of his followers, related the adventure he had undergone,
and the success which had attended the base artifices of the diabolical
Jingle.

<P>"And, the attack of rheumatism which I caught in that garden," said
Mr. Pickwick, in conclusion, "renders me lame at this moment."

<P>"I, too, have had something of an adventure," said Mr. Winkle, with
a smile; and at the request of Mr. Pickwick he detailed the malicious libel
of the Eatanswill Independent, and the consequent excitement of their friend,
the editor.

<P>Mr. Pickwick's brow darkened during the recital. His friends observed
it, and, when Mr. Winkle had concluded, maintained a profound silence.
Mr. Pickwick struck the table emphatically with his clenched fist, and
spoke as follows.

<P>"Is it not a wonderful circumstance," said Mr. Pickwick, "that we seem
destined to enter no man's house without involving him in some degree of
trouble? Does it not, I ask, bespeak the indiscretion, or, worse than that,
the blackness of heart--that I should say so!--of my followers, that, beneath
whatever roof they locate, they disturb the peace of mind and happiness
of some confiding female? Is it not, I say--"

<P>Mr. Pickwick would in all probability have gone on for some time, had
not the entrance of Sam, with a letter, caused him to break off in his
eloquent discourse. He passed his handkerchief across his forehead, took
off his spectacles, wiped them, and put them on again; and his voice had
recovered its wonted softness of tone when he said:

<P>"What have you there, Sam?"

<P>"Called at the Post-office just now, and found this here letter, as
has laid there for two days," replied Mr. Weller. "It's sealed with a vafer,
and directed in round hand."

<P>"I don't know this hand," said Mr. Pickwick, opening the letter. "Mercy
on us! what's this? It must be a jest; it--it--can't be true."

<P>"What's the matter?" was the general inquiry.

<P>"Nobody dead, is there?" said Wardle, alarmed at the horror in Mr. Pickwick's
countenance.

<P>Mr. Pickwick made no reply, but, pushing the letter across the table,
and desiring Mr. Tupman to read it aloud, fell back in his chair with a
look of vacant astonishment quite alarming to behold.

<P>Mr. Tupman, with a trembling voice, read the letter, of which the following
is a copy:-- <I>Freeman's Court, Cornhill, August 28th</I>, 1830. <I>Bardell
against Pickwick</I>. <I>Sir</I>,

<P><I>Having been instructed by Mrs. Martha Bardell to commence an action
against you for a breach of promise of marriage, for which the plaintiff
lays her damages at fifteen hundred pounds, we beg to inform you that a
writ has been issued against you in this suit in the Court of Common Pleas;
and request to know, by return of post, the name of your attorney in London,
who will accept service thereof</I>.

<P><I>We are, Sir</I>,

<P><I>Your obedient servants</I>,

<P><I>Dodson and Fogg</I>.

<P><I>Mr. Samuel Pickwick</I>.

<P>There was something so impressive in the mute astonishment with which
each man regarded his neighbour, and every man regarded Mr. Pickwick, that
all seemed afraid to speak. The silence was at length broken by Mr. Tupman.

<P>"Dodson and Fogg," he repeated mechanically.

<P>"Bardell and Pickwick," said Mr. Snodgrass, musing.

<P>"Peace of mind and happiness of confiding females," murmured Mr. winkle,
with an air of abstraction.

<P>"It's a conspiracy," said Mr. Pickwick, at length recovering the power
of speech; "a base conspiracy between these two grasping attorneys, Dodson
and Fogg. Mrs. Bardell would never do it;--she hasn't the heart to do it;--she
hasn't the case to do it. Ridiculous--ridiculous."

<P>"Of her heart," said Wardle, with a smile, "you should certainly be
the best judge. I don't wish to discourage you, but I should certainly
say that, of her case, Dodson and Fogg are far better judges than any of
us can be."

<P>"It's a vile attempt to extort money," said Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"I hope it is," said Wardle, with a short, dry cough.

<P>"Who ever heard me address her in any way but that in which a lodger
would address his landlady?" continued Mr. Pickwick, with great vehemence.
"Who ever saw me with her? Not even my friends here--"

<P>"Except on one occasion," said Mr. Tupman.

<P>Mr. Pickwick changed colour.

<P>"Ah," said Mr. Wardle. "Well, that's important. There was nothing suspicious
then, I suppose?"

<P>Mr. Tupman glanced timidly at his leader. "Why," said he, "there was
nothing suspicious; but--I don't know how it happened, mind--she certainly
was reclining in his arms."

<P>"Gracious powers!" ejaculated Mr. Pickwick, as the recollection of the
scene in question struck forcibly upon him; "what a dreadful instance of
the force of circumstances! So she was--so she was."

<P>"And our friend was soothing her anguish," said Mr. Winkle, rather maliciously.

<P>"So I was," said Mr. Pickwick. "I won't deny it. So I was."

<P>"Hallo!" said Wardle; "for a case in which there's nothing suspicious,
this looks rather queer--eh, Pickwick? Ah, sly dog--sly dog!" and he laughed
till the glasses on the sideboard rang again.

<P>"What a dreadful conjunction of appearances!" exclaimed Mr. Pickwick,
resting his chin upon his hands. "Winkle--Tupman--I beg your pardon for
the observations I made just now. We are all the victims of circumstances,
and I the greatest." With this apology Mr. Pickwick buried his head in
his hands, and ruminated; while Wardle measured out a regular circle of
nods and winks, addressed to the other members of the company.

<P>"I'll have it explained, though," said Mr. Pickwick, raising his head
and hammering the table. "I'll see this Dodson and Fogg! I'll go to London
to-morrow."

<P>"Not to-morrow," said Wardle; "you're too lame."

<P>"Well, then, next day."

<P>"Next day is the first of September, and you're pledged to ride out
with us, as far as Sir Geoffrey Manning's grounds, at all events, and to
meet us at lunch, if you don't take the field."

<P>"Well, then, the day after," said Mr. Pickwick; "Thursday.--Sam!"

<P>"Sir," replied Mr. Weller.

<P>"Take two places outside to London, on Thursday morning, for yourself
and me."

<P>"Wery well, sir."

<P>Mr. Weller left the room, and departed slowly on his errand, with his
hands in his pocket, and his eyes fixed on the ground.

<P>"Rum feller, the hemperor," said Mr. Weller, as he walked slowly up
the street. "Think o' his making up to that ere Mrs. Bardell--vith a little
boy, too! Always the vay vith these here old 'uns hows'ever, as is such
steady goers to look at. I didn't think he'd ha' done it, though--I didn't
think he'd ha' done it!" Moralising in this strain, Mr. Samuel Weller bent
his steps towards the booking-office.
