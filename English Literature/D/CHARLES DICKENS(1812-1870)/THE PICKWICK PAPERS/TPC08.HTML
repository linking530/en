<P>T<FONT SIZE=-1>HE</FONT> quiet seclusion of Dingley Dell, the presence
of so many of the gentler sex, and the solicitude and anxiety they evinced
in his behalf were all favourable to the growth and development of those
softer feelings which nature had implanted deep in the bosom of Mr. Tracy
Tupman, and which now appeared destined to centre in one lovely object.
The young ladies were pretty, their manners winning, their dispositions
unexceptionable; but there was a dignity in the air, a touch-me-not-ishness
in the walk, a majesty in the eye of the spinster aunt, to which, at their
time of life, they could lay no claim, which distinguished her from any
female on whom Mr. Tupman had ever gazed. That there was something kindred
in their nature, something congenial in their souls, something mysteriously
sympathetic in their bosoms, was evident. Her name was the first that rose
to Mr. Tupman's lips as he lay wounded on the grass; and her hysteric laughter
was the first sound that fell upon his ear when he was supported to the
house. But had her agitation arisen from an amiable and feminine sensibility
which would have been equally irrepressible in any case; or had it been
called forth by a more ardent and passionate feeling, which he, of all
men living, could alone awaken? These were the doubts which racked his
brain as he lay extended on the sofa: these were the doubts which he determined
should be at once and for ever resolved.

<P>It was evening. Isabella and Emily had strolled out with Mr. Trundle;
the deaf old lady had fallen asleep in her chair; the snoring of the fat
boy, penetrated in a low and monotonous sound from the distant kitchen;
the buxom servants were lounging at the side-door, enjoying the pleasantness
of the hour, and the delights of a flirtation, on first principles, with
certain unwieldy animals attached to the farm; and there sat the interesting
pair, uncared for by all, caring for none, and dreaming only of themselves;
there they sat, in short, like a pair of carefully-folded kid-gloves--bound
up in each other.

<P>"I have forgotten my flowers," said the spinster aunt.

<P>"Water them now," said Mr. Tupman in accents of persuasion.

<P>"You will take cold in the evening air," urged the spinster aunt, affectionately.

<P>"No, no," said Mr. Tupman rising; "it will do me good. Let me accompany
you."

<P>The lady paused to adjust the sling in which the left arm of the youth
was placed, and taking his right arm led him to the garden.

<P>There was a bower at the further end, with honeysuckle, jessamine, and
creeping plants--one of those sweet retreats which humane men erect for
the accommodation of spiders.

<P>The spinster aunt took up a large watering-pot which lay in one corner,
and was about to leave the arbour. Mr. Tupman detained her, and drew her
to a seat beside him.

<P>"Miss Wardle!" said he.

<P>The spinster aunt trembled, till some pebbles which had accidentally
found their way into the large watering-pot shook like an infant's rattle.

<P>"Mr. Wardle," said Mr. Tupman, "you are an angel."

<P>"Mr. Tupman!" exclaimed Rachael, blushing as red as the watering-pot
itself.

<P>"Nay," said the eloquent Pickwickian--"I know it but too well."

<P>"All women are angels they say," murmured the lady, playfully.

<P>"Then what can <I>you</I> be; or to what, without presumption, can I
compare you?" replied Mr. Tupman. "Where was the woman ever seen who resembled
you? Where else could I hope to find so rare a combination of excellence
and beauty? Where else could I seek to--Oh!" Here Mr. Tupman paused, and
pressed the hand which clasped the handle of the happy watering-pot.

<P>The lady turned aside her head. "Men are such deceivers," she softly
whispered.

<P>"They are, they are," ejaculated Mr. Tupman; "but not all men. There
lives at least one being who can never change--one being who would be content
to devote his whole existence to your happiness--who lives but in your
eyes--who breathes but in your smiles--who bears the heavy burden of life
itself only for you."

<P>"Could such an individual be found," said the lady--

<P>"But he <I>can</I> be found," said the ardent Mr. Tupman, interposing.
"He <I>is</I> found. He is here, Miss Wardle." And ere the lady was aware
of his intention, Mr. Tupman had sunk upon his knees at her feet.

<P>"Mr. Tupman, rise," said Rachael.

<P>"Never!" was the valorous reply. "Oh, Rachael!"--He seized her passive
hand, and the watering-pot fell to the ground as he pressed it to his lips--"Oh,
Rachael! say you love me."

<P>"Mr. Tupman," said the spinster aunt, with averted head--"I can hardly
speak the words; but--but--you are not wholly indifferent to me."

<P>Mr. Tupman no sooner heard this avowal, than he proceeded to do what
his enthusiastic emotions prompted, and what, for aught we know (for we
are but little acquainted with such matters), people so circumstanced always
do. He jumped up, and, throwing his arm round the neck of the spinster
aunt, imprinted upon her lips numerous kisses, which after a due show of
struggling and resistance, she received so passively, that there is no
telling how many more Mr. Tupman might have bestowed, if the lady had not
given a very unaffected start and exclaimed in an affrighted tone--

<P>"Mr. Tupman, we are observed!--we are discovered!"

<P>Mr. Tupman looked round. There was the fat boy, perfectly motionless,
with his large circular eyes staring into the arbour, but without the slightest
expression on his face that the most expert physiognomist could have referred
to astonishment, curiosity, or any other known passion that agitates the
human breast. Mr. Tupman gazed on the fat boy, and the fat boy stared at
him; and the longer Mr. Tupman observed the utter vacancy of the fat boy's
countenance, the more convinced he became that he either did not know,
or did not understand, anything that had been going forward. Under this
impression, he said with great firmness--

<P>"What do you want here, sir?"

<P>"Supper's ready, sir," was the prompt reply.

<P>"Have you just come here, sir?" inquired Mr. Tupman, with a piercing
look.

<P>"Just," replied the fat boy.

<P>Mr. Tupman looked at him very hard again; but there was not a wink in
his eye, or a curve in his face.

<P>Mr. Tupman took the arm of the spinster aunt, and walked towards the
house; the fat boy followed behind.

<P>"He knows nothing of what has happened," he whispered.

<P>"Nothing," said the spinster aunt.

<P>There was a sound behind them, as of an imperfectly suppressed chuckle.
Mr. Tupman turned sharply round. No; it could not have been the fat boy;
there was not a gleam of mirth, or anything but feeding in his whole visage.

<P>"He must have been fast asleep," whispered Mr. Tupman.

<P>"I have not the least doubt of it," replied the spinster aunt.

<P>They both laughed heartily.

<P>Mr. Tupman was wrong. The fat boy, for once, had not been fast asleep.
He was awake--wide awake--to what had been going forward.

<P>The supper passed off without any attempt at a general conversation.
The old lady had gone to bed; Isabella Wardle devoted herself exclusively
to Mr. Trundle; the spinster's attentions were reserved for Mr. Tupman;
and Emily's thoughts appeared to be engrossed by some distant object--possibly
they were with the absent Snodgrass.

<P>Eleven--twelve--one o'clock had struck, and the gentlemen had not arrived.
Consternation sat on every face. Could they have been waylaid and robbed?
Should they send men and lanterns in every direction by which they could
be supposed likely to have travelled home? or should they--Hark! there
they were. What could have made them so late? A strange voice, too! To
whom could it belong? They rushed into the kitchen whither the truants
had repaired, and at once obtained rather more than a glimmering of the
real state of the case.

<P>Mr. Pickwick, with his hands in his pockets and his hat cocked completely
over his left eye, was leaning against the dresser, shaking his head from
side to side, and producing a constant succession of the blandest and most
benevolent smiles without being moved thereunto by any discernible cause
or pretence whatsoever; old Mr. Wardle, with a highly-inflamed countenance,
was grasping the hand of a strange gentleman muttering protestations of
eternal friendship; Mr. Winkle, supporting himself by the eight-day clock,
was feebly invoking destruction upon the head of any member of the family
who should suggest the propriety of his retiring for the night; and Mr.
Snodgrass had sunk into a chair, with an expression of the most abject
and hopeless misery that the human mind can imagine, portrayed in every
lineament of his expressive face.

<P>"Is anything the matter?" inquired the three ladies.

<P>"Nothing the matter," replied Mr. Pickwick. "We--we're--all right.--I
say, Wardle, we're all right, an't we?"

<P>"I should think so," replied the jolly host.--"My dears, here's my friend,
Mr. Jingle--Mr. Pickwick's friend, Mr. Jingle, come 'pon--little visit."

<P>"Is anything the matter with Mr. Snodgrass, sir?" inquired Emily, with
great anxiety.

<P>"Nothing the matter, ma'am," replied the stranger. "Cricket dinner--glorious
party--capital songs--old port--claret--good--very good--wine, ma'am--wine."

<P>"It wasn't the wine," murmured Mr. Snodgrass, in a broken voice. "It
was the salmon." (Somehow or other, it never <I>is</I> the wine, in these
cases.)

<P>"Hadn't they better go to bed, ma'am?" inquired Emma. "Two of the boys
will carry the gentlemen up-stairs."

<P>"I won't go to bed," said Mr. Winkle, firmly.

<P>"No living boy shall carry me," said Mr. Pickwick, stoutly;--and he
went on smiling as before.

<P>"Hurrah!" gasped Mr. Winkle, faintly.

<P>"Hurrah!" echoed Mr. Pickwick, taking off his hat and dashing it on
the floor, and insanely casting his spectacles into the middle of the kitchen.--At
this humorous feat he laughed outright.

<P>"Let's--have--'nother--bottle," cried Mr. Winkle, commencing in a very
loud key, and ending in a very faint one. His head dropped upon his breast;
and, muttering his invincible determination not to go to his bed, and a
sanguinary regret that he had not "done for old Tupman" in the morning,
he fell fast asleep; in which condition he was borne to his apartment by
two young giants under the personal superintendence of the fat boy, to
whose protecting care Mr. Snodgrass shortly afterwards confided his own
person. Mr. Pickwick accepted the proffered arm of Mr. Tupman and quietly
disappeared, smiling more than ever; and Mr. Wardle, after taking as affectionate
a leave of the whole family as if he were ordered for immediate execution,
consigned to Mr. Trundle the honour of conveying him upstairs, and retired,
with a very futile attempt to look impressively solemn and dignified.

<P>"What a shocking scene!" said the spinster aunt.

<P>"Dis--gusting!" ejaculated both the young ladies.

<P>"Dreadful--dreadful!" said Jingle, looking very grave: he was about
a bottle and a half ahead of any of his companions. "Horrid spectacle--very!"

<P>"What a nice man!" whispered the spinster aunt to Mr. Tupman.

<P>"Good-looking, too!" whispered Emily Wardle.

<P>"Oh, decidedly," observed the spinster aunt.

<P>Mr. Tupman thought of the widow at Rochester: and his mind was troubled.
The succeeding half-hour's conversation was not of a nature to calm his
perturbed spirit. The new visitor was very talkative, and the number of
his anecdotes was only to the exceeded by the extent of his politeness.
Mr. Tupman felt that as Jingle's popularity increased, he (Tupman) retired
further into the shade. His laughter was forced--his merriment feigned;
and when at last he laid his aching temples between the sheets, he thought,
with horrid delight, on the satisfaction it would afford him to have Jingle's
head at that moment between the feather bed and the mattress.

<P>The indefatigable stranger rose betimes next morning, and, although
his companions remained in bed overpowered with the dissipation of the
previous night, exerted himself most successfully to promote the hilarity
of the breakfast-table. So successful were his efforts, that even the deaf
old lady insisted on having one or two of his best jokes retailed through
the trumpet; and even she condescended to observe to the spinster aunt,
that "he" (meaning Jingle) "was an impudent young fellow:" a sentiment
in which all her relations then and there present thoroughly coincided.

<P>It was the old lady's habit on the fine summer mornings to repair to
the arbour in which Mr. Tupman had already signalised himself, in form
and manner following: first, the fat boy fetched from a peg behind the
old lady's bed-room door, a close black satin bonnet, a warm cotton shawl,
and a thick stick with a capacious handle; and the old lady having put
on the bonnet and shawl at her leisure, would lean one hand on the stick
and the other on the fat boy's shoulder, and walk leisurely to the arbour,
where the fat boy would leave her to enjoy the fresh air for the space
of half an hour; at the expiration of which time he would return and reconduct
her to the house.

<P>The old lady was very precise and very particular; and as this ceremony
had been observed for three successive summers without the slightest deviation
from the accustomed form, she was not a little surprised on this particular
morning, to see the fat boy, instead of leaving the arbour, walk a few
paces out of it, look carefully round him in every direction, and return
towards her with great stealth and an air of the most profound mystery.

<P>The old lady was timorous--most old ladies are--and her first impression
was that the bloated lad was about to do her some grievous bodily harm
with the view of possessing himself of her loose coin. She would have cried
for assistance, but age and infirmity had long ago deprived her of the
power of screaming; she, therefore, watched his motions with feelings of
intense terror, which were in no degree diminished by his coming close
up to her, and shouting in her ear in an agitated, and as it seemed to
her, a threatening tone--

<P>"Missus!"

<P>Now it so happened that Mr. Jingle was walking in the garden close to
the arbour at this moment. He too heard the shout of "Missus," and stopped
to hear more. There were three reasons for his doing so. In the first place,
he was idle and curious; secondly, he was by no means scrupulous; thirdly,
and lastly, he was concealed from view by some flowering shrubs. So there
he stood, and there he listened.

<P>"Missus!" shouted the fat boy.

<P>"Well, Joe," said the trembling old lady. "I'm sure I have been a good
mistress to you, Joe. You have invariably been treated very kindly. You
have never had too much to do; and you have always had enough to eat."

<P>This last was an appeal to the fat boy's most sensitive feelings. He
seemed touched, as he replied, emphatically--

<P>"I knows I has."

<P>"Then what can you want to do now?" said the old lady, gaining courage.

<P>"I wants to make your flesh creep," replied the boy.

<P>This sounded like a very bloodthirsty mode of showing one's gratitude;
and as the old lady did not precisely understand the process by which such
a result was to be attained, all her former horrors returned.

<P>"What do you think I see in this very arbour last night?" inquired the
boy.

<P>"Bless us! What?" exclaimed the old lady, alarmed at the solemn manner
of the corpulent youth.

<P>"The strange gentleman--him as had his arm hurt--a kissin' and huggin'--"

<P>"Who, Joe? None of the servants, I hope."

<P>"Worser than that," roared the fat boy, in the old lady's ear.

<P>"Not one of my grand-da'aters?"

<P>"Worser than that."

<P>"Worse than <I>that</I>, Joe!" said the old lady, who had thought this
the extreme limit of human atrocity. "Who was it, Joe? I insist upon knowing."

<P>The fat boy looked cautiously round, and having concluded his survey,
shouted in the old lady's ear:

<P>"Miss Rachael."

<P>"What!" said the old lady, in a shrill tone. "Speak louder."

<P>"Miss Rachael," roared the fat boy.

<P>"My da'ater!"

<P>The train of nods which the fat boy gave by way of assent communicated
a <I>blanc-mange</I>-like motion to his fat cheeks.

<P>"And she suffered him!" exclaimed the old lady.

<P>A grin stole over the fat boy's features as he said:

<P>"I see her a kissin' of him agin."

<P>If Mr. Jingle, from his place of concealment, could have beheld the
expression which the old lady's face assumed at this communication, the
probability is that a sudden burst of laughter would have betrayed his
close vicinity to the summer-house. He listened attentively. Fragments
of angry sentences such as, "Without my permission!"--"At her time of life"--"Miserable
old 'ooman like me"--"Might have waited till I was dead," and so forth,
reached his ears; and then he heard the heels of the fat boy's boots crunching
the gravel, as he retired and left the old lady alone.

<P>It was a remarkable coincidence perhaps, but it was nevertheless a fact,
that Mr. Jingle within five minutes after his arrival at Manor Farm on
the preceding night, had inwardly resolved to lay siege to the heart of
the spinster aunt, without delay. He had observation enough to see, that
his off-hand manner was by no means disagreeable to the fair object of
his attack; and he had more than a strong suspicion that she possessed
that most desirable of all requisites, a small independence. The imperative
necessity of ousting his rival by some means or other, flashed quickly
upon him, and he immediately resolved to adopt certain proceedings tending
to that end and object, without a moment's delay. Fielding tells us that
man is fire, and woman tow, and the Prince of Darkness sets a light to
'em. Mr. Jingle knew that young men, to spinster aunts, are as lighted
gas to gunpowder, and he determined to essay the effect of an explosion
without loss of time.

<P>Full of reflections upon this important decision, he crept from his
place of concealment, and, under cover of the shrubs before mentioned,
approached the house. Fortune seemed determined to favour his design. Mr.
Tupman and the rest of the gentlemen left the garden by the side gate just
as he obtained a view of it; and the young ladies, he knew, had walked
out alone, soon after breakfast. The coast was clear.

<P>The breakfast-parlour door was partially open. He peeped in. The spinster
aunt was knitting. He coughed; she looked up and smiled. Hesitation formed
no part of Mr. Alfred Jingle's character. He laid his finger on his lips
mysteriously, walked in, and closed the door.

<P>"Miss Wardle," said Mr. Jingle, with affected earnestness, "forgive
intrusion--short acquaintance--no time for ceremony--all discovered."

<P>"Sir!" said the spinster aunt, rather astonished by the unexpected apparition
and somewhat doubtful of Mr. Jingle's sanity.

<P>"Hush!" said Mr. Jingle, in a stage whisper;--"large boy--dumpling face--round
eyes--rascal!" Here he shook his head expressively, and the spinster aunt
trembled with agitation.

<P>"I presume you allude to Joseph, sir?" said the lady, making an effort
to appear composed.

<P>"Yes, ma'am--damn that Joe!--treacherous dog, Joe--told the old lady--old
lady furious--wild--raving--arbour--Tupman--kissing and hugging--all that
sort of thing--eh, ma'am--eh?"

<P>"Mr. Jingle," said the spinster aunt, "if you come here, sir, to insult
me--"

<P>"Not at all--by no means," replied the unabashed Mr. Jingle;--"overheard
the tale--came to warn you of your danger--tender my services--prevent
the hubbub. Never mind--think it an insult--leave the room"--and he turned,
as if to carry the threat into execution.

<P>"What <I>shall</I> I do!" said the poor spinster, bursting into tears.
"My brother will be furious."

<P>"Of course he will," said Mr. Jingle, pausing--"outrageous."

<P>"Oh, Mr. Jingle, what <I>can</I> I say!" exclaimed the spinster aunt,
in another flood of despair.

<P>"Say he dream it," replied Mr. Jingle, coolly.

<P>A ray of comfort darted across the mind of the spinster aunt at this
suggestion. Mr. Jingle perceived it, and followed up his advantage.

<P>"Pooh, pooh!--nothing more easy--blackguard boy--lovely woman--fat boy
horsewhipped--you believed--end of the matter--all comfortable."

<P>Whether the probability of escaping from the consequences of this ill-timed
discovery was delightful to the spinster's feelings, or whether the hearing
herself described as a "lovely woman" softened the asperity of her grief,
we know not. She blushed slightly, and cast a grateful look on Mr. Jingle.

<P>That insinuating gentleman sighed deeply, fixed his eyes on the spinster
aunt's face for a couple of minutes, started melodramatically, and suddenly
withdrew them.

<P>"You seem unhappy, Mr. Jingle," said the lady, in a plaintive voice.
"May I show my gratitude for your kind interference, by inquiring into
the cause, with a view, if possible, to its removal?"

<P>"Ha!" exclaimed Mr. Jingle, with another start--"removal! remove <I>my</I>
unhappiness, and your love bestowed upon a man who is insensible to the
blessing--who even now contemplates a design upon the affections of the
niece of the creature who--but no; he is my friend; I will not expose his
vices. Miss Wardle--farewell!" At the conclusion of this address, the most
consecutive he was ever known to utter, Mr. Jingle applied to his eyes
the remnant of a handkerchief before noticed, and turned towards the door.

<P>"Stay, Mr. Jingle!" said the spinster aunt emphatically. "You have made
an allusion to Mr. Tupman--explain it."

<P>"Never!" exclaimed Jingle, with a professional (<I>i.e.</I> theatrical)
air. "Never!" and, by way of showing that he had no desire to be questioned
further, he drew a chair close to that of the spinster aunt and sat down.

<P>"Mr. Jingle," said the aunt, "I entreat--I implore you, if there is
any dreadful mystery connected with Mr. Tupman, reveal it."

<P>"Can I," said Mr. Jingle, fixing his eyes on the aunt's face--"can I
see--lovely creature--sacrificed at the shrine--heartless avarice!" He
appeared to be struggling with various conflicting emotions for a few seconds,
and then said in a low deep voice--

<P>"Tupman only wants your money."

<P>"The wretch!" exclaimed the spinster, with energetic indignation. (Mr.
Jingle's doubts were resolved. She <I>had</I> money.)

<P>"More than that," said Jingle--"loves another."

<P>"Another!" ejaculated the spinster. "Who?"

<P>"Short girl--black eyes--niece Emily."

<P>There was a pause.

<P>Now, if there were one individual in the whole world, of whom the spinster
aunt entertained a mortal and deeply-rooted jealousy, it was this identical
niece. The colour rushed over her face and neck, and she tossed her head
in silence with an air of ineffable contempt. At last, biting her thin
lips, and bridling up, she said--

<P>"It can't be. I won't believe it."

<P>"Watch 'em," said Jingle.

<P>"I will," said the aunt.

<P>"Watch his looks."

<P>"I will."

<P>"His whispers."

<P>"I will."

<P>"He'll sit next her at table."

<P>"Let him."

<P>"He'll flatter her."

<P>"Let him."

<P>"He'll pay her every possible attention."

<P>"Let him."

<P>"And he'll cut you."

<P>"Cut <I>me!</I>" screamed the spinster aunt. "<I>He</I> cut <I>me;--will</I>
he!" and she trembled with rage and disappointment.

<P>"You will convince yourself?" said Jingle.

<P>"I will."

<P>"You'll show your spirit?"

<P>"I will."

<P>"You'll not have him afterwards?"

<P>"Never."

<P>"You'll take somebody else?"

<P>"Yes."

<P>"You shall."

<P>Mr. Jingle fell on his knees, remained thereupon for five minutes thereafter:
and rose the accepted lover of the spinster aunt: conditionally upon Mr.
Tupman's perjury being made clear and manifest.

<P>The burden of proof lay with Mr. Alfred Jingle; and he produced his
evidence that very day at dinner. The spinster aunt could hardly believe
her eyes. Mr. Tracy Tupman was established at Emily's side, ogling, whispering,
and smiling, in opposition to Mr. Snodgrass. Not a word, not a look, not
a glance, did he bestow upon his heart's pride of the evening before.

<P>"Damn that boy!" thought old Mr. Wardle to himself.--He had heard the
story from his mother. "Damn that boy! He <I>must</I> have been asleep.
It's all imagination."

<P>"Traitor!" thought the spinster aunt. "Dear Mr. Jingle was not deceiving
me. Ugh! how I hate the wretch!"

<P>The following conversation may serve to explain to our readers this
apparently unaccountable alteration of deportment on the part of Mr. Tracy
Tupman.

<P>The time was evening; the scene the garden. There were two figures walking
in a side path; one was rather short and stout; the other rather tall and
slim. They were Mr. Tupman and Mr. Jingle. The stout figure commenced the
dialogue.

<P>"How did I do it?" he inquired.

<P>"Splendid--capital--couldn't act better myself--you must repeat the
part to-morrow--every evening, till further notice."

<P>"Does Rachael still wish it?"

<P>"Of course--she don't like it--but must be done--avert suspicion--afraid
of her brother--says there's no help for it--only a few days more--when
old folks blinded--crown your happiness."

<P>"Any message?"

<P>"Love--best love--kindest regards--unalterable affection. Can I say
anything for you?"

<P>"My dear fellow," replied the unsuspicious Mr. Tupman, fervently grasping
his "friend's" hand--"carry my best love--say how hard I find it to dissemble--say
anything that's kind; but add how sensible I am of the necessity of the
suggestion she made to me, through you, this morning. Say I applaud her
wisdom and admire her discretion."

<P>"I will. Anything more?"

<P>"Nothing; only add how ardently I long for the time when I may call
her mine, and all dissimulation may be unnecessary."

<P>"Certainly, certainly. Anything more?"

<P>"Oh, my friend!" said poor Mr. Tupman, again grasping the hand of his
companion, "receive my warmest thanks for your disinterested kindness;
and forgive me if I have ever, even in thought, done you the injustice
of supposing that you <I>could</I> stand in my way. My dear friend, can
I ever repay you?"

<P>"Don't talk of it," replied Mr. Jingle. He stopped short, as if suddenly
recollecting something, and said--"By-the-bye --can't spare ten pounds,
can you?--very particular purpose--pay you in three days."

<P>"I dare say I can," replied Mr. Tupman, in the fulness of his heart.
"Three days, you say?"

<P>"Only three days--all over then--no more difficulties."

<P>Mr. Tupman counted the money into his companion's hand, and he dropped
it piece by piece into his pocket, as they walked towards the house.

<P>"Be careful," said Mr. Jingle--"not a look."

<P>"Not a wink," said Mr. Tupman.

<P>"Not a syllable."

<P>"Not a whisper."

<P>"All your attentions to the niece--rather rude, than otherwise, to the
aunt--only way of deceiving the old ones."

<P>"I'll take care," said Mr. Tupman aloud.

<P>"And <I>I</I>'ll take care," said Mr. Jingle internally; and they entered
the house.

<P>The scene of that afternoon was repeated that evening, and on the three
afternoons and evenings next ensuing. On the fourth, the host was in high
spirits, for he had satisfied himself that there was no ground for the
charge against Mr. Tupman. So was Mr. Tupman, for Mr. Jingle had told him
that his affair would soon be brought to a crisis. So was Mr. Pickwick,
for he was seldom otherwise. So was not Mr. Snodgrass, for he had grown
jealous of Mr. Tupman. So was the old lady, for she had been winning at
whist. So were Mr. Jingle and Miss Wardle, for reasons of sufficient importance
in this eventful history to be narrated in another chapter.
