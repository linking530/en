CHAPTER XII</H1></CENTER>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=-1>DESCRIPTIVE OF A VERY IMPORTANT PROCEEDING ON THE
PART OF MR. PICKWICK; NO LESS AN EPOCH IN HIS LIFE, THAN IN THIS HISTORY</FONT></CENTER>


<P>M<FONT SIZE=-1>R</FONT>. P<FONT SIZE=-1>ICKWICK'S</FONT> apartments
in Goswell Street, although on a limited scale, were not only of a very
neat and comfortable description, but peculiarly adapted for the residence
of a man of his genius and observation. His sitting-room was the first
floor front, his bedroom the second floor front; and thus, whether he were
sitting at his desk in his parlour, or standing before the dressing-glass
in his dormitory, he had an equal opportunity of contemplating human nature
in all the numerous phases it exhibits, in that not more populous than
popular thoroughfare. His landlady, Mrs. Bardell--the relict and sole executrix
of a deceased custom-house officer--was a comely woman of bustling manners
and agreeable appearance, with a natural genius for cooking, improved by
study and long practice, into an exquisite talent. There were no children,
no servants, no fowls. The only other inmates of the house were a large
man and a small boy; the first a lodger, the second a production of Mrs.
Bardell's. The large man was always home precisely at ten o'clock at night,
at which hour he regularly condensed himself into the limits of a dwarfish
French bedstead in the back parlour; and the infantine sports and gymnastic
exercises of Master Bardell were exclusively confined to the neighbouring
pavements and gutters. Cleanliness and quiet reigned throughout the house;
and in it Mr. Pickwick's will was law.

<P>To any one acquainted with these points of the domestic economy of the
establishment, and conversant with the admirable regulation of Mr. Pickwick's
mind, his appearance and behaviour on the morning previous to that which
had been fixed upon for the journey to Eatanswill, would have been most
mysterious and unaccountable. He paced the room to and fro with hurried
steps, popped his head out of the window at intervals of about three minutes
each, constantly referred to his watch, and exhibited many other manifestations
of impatience very unusual with him. It was evident that something of great
importance was in contemplation, but what that something was, not even
Mrs. Bardell herself had been enabled to discover.

<P>"Mrs. Bardell," said Mr. Pickwick, at last, as that amiable female approached
the termination of a prolonged dusting of the apartment.

<P>"Sir," said Mrs. Bardell.

<P>"Your little boy is a very long time gone."

<P>"Why it's a good long way to the Borough, sir," remonstrated Mrs. Bardell.

<P>"Ah," said Mr. Pickwick, "very true; so it is."

<P>Mr. Pickwick relapsed into silence, and Mrs. Bardell resumed her dusting.

<P>"Mrs. Bardell," said Mr. Pickwick, at the expiration of a few minutes.

<P>"Sir," said Mrs. Bardell again.

<P>"Do you think it a much greater expense to keep two people, than to
keep one?"

<P>"La, Mr. Pickwick," said Mrs. Bardell, colouring up to the very border
of her cap, as she fancied she observed a species of matrimonial twinkle
in the eyes of her lodger; "La, Mr. Pickwick, what a question!"

<P>"Well, but <I>do</I> you?" inquired Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"That depends--" said Mrs. Bardell, approaching the duster very near
to Mr. Pickwick's elbow, which was planted on the table--"that depends
a good deal upon the person, you know, Mr. Pickwick; and whether it's a
saving and careful person, sir."

<P>"That's very true," said Mr. Pickwick, "but the person I have in my
eye (here he looked very hard at Mrs. Bardell) I think possesses these
qualities; and has, moreover, a considerable knowledge of the world, and
a great deal of sharpness, Mrs. Bardell; which may be of material use to
me."

<P>"La, Mr. Pickwick," said Mrs. Bardell; the crimson rising to her cap-border
again.

<P>"I do," said Mr. Pickwick, growing energetic, as was his wont in speaking
of a subject which interested him, "I do, indeed; and to tell you the truth,
Mrs. Bardell, I have made up my mind."

<P>"Dear me, sir," exclaimed Mrs. Bardell.

<P>"You'll think it very strange now," said the amiable Mr. Pickwick, with
a good-humoured glance at his companion, "that I never consulted you about
this matter, and never even mentioned it, till I sent your little boy out
this morning--eh?"

<P>Mrs. Bardell could only reply by a look. She had long worshipped Mr.
Pickwick at a distance, but here she was, all at once, raised to a pinnacle
to which her wildest and most extravagant hopes had never dared to aspire.
Mr. Pickwick was going to propose--a deliberate plan, too--sent her little
boy to the Borough, to get him out of the way--how thoughtful--how considerate!

<P>"Well," said Mr. Pickwick, "what do you think?"

<P>"Oh, Mr. Pickwick," said Mrs. Bardell, trembling with agitation, "you're
very kind, sir."

<P>"It'll save you a good deal of trouble, won't it?" said Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"Oh, I never thought anything of the trouble, sir," replied Mrs. Bardell;
"and, of course, I should take more trouble to please you then, than ever;
but it is so kind of you, Mr. Pickwick, to have so much consideration for
my loneliness."

<P>"Ah, to be sure," said Mr. Pickwick; "I never thought of that. When
I am in town, you'll always have somebody to sit with you. To be sure,
so you will."

<P>"I'm sure I ought to be a very happy woman," said Mrs. Bardell.

<P>"And your little boy--" said Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"Bless his heart!" interposed Mrs. Bardell, with a maternal sob.

<P>"He, too, will have a companion," resumed Mr. Pickwick, "a lively one,
who'll teach him, I'll be bound, more tricks in a week than he would ever
learn in a year." And Mr. Pickwick smiled placidly.

<P>"Oh you dear--" said Mrs. Bardell.

<P>Mr. Pickwick started.

<P>"Oh you kind, good, playful dear," said Mrs. Bardell; and without more
ado, she rose from her chair, and flung her arms round Mr. Pickwick's neck,
with a cataract of tears and a chorus of sobs.

<P>"Bless my soul," cried the astonished Mr. Pickwick;--"Mrs. Bardell my
good woman--dear me, what a situation--pray consider.--Mrs. Bardell, don't--if
anybody should come--"

<P>"Oh, let them come," exclaimed Mrs. Bardell, frantically; "I'll never
leave you,--dear, kind, good, soul;" and with these words, Mrs. Bardell
clung the tighter.

<P>"Mercy upon me," said Mr. Pickwick, struggling violently, "I hear somebody
coming up the stairs. Don't, don't, there's a good creature, don't." But
entreaty and remonstrance were alike unavailing: for Mrs. Bardell had fainted
in Mr. Pickwick's arms; and before he could gain time to deposit her on
a chair, Master Bardell entered the room, ushering in Mr. Tupman, Mr. Winkle,
and Mr. Snodgrass.

<P>Mr. Pickwick was struck motionless and speechless. He stood with his
lovely burden in his arms, gazing vacantly on the countenances of his friends,
without the slightest attempt at recognition or explanation. They, in their
turn, stared at him; and Master Bardell, in his turn, stared at everybody.

<P>The astonishment of the Pickwickians was so absorbing, and the perplexity
of Mr. Pickwick was so extreme, that they might have remained in exactly
the same relative situations until the suspended animation of the lady
was restored, had it not been for a most beautiful and touching expression
of filial affection on the part of her youthful son. Clad in a tight suit
of corduroy, spangled with brass buttons of a very considerable size, he
at first stood at the door astounded and uncertain; but by degrees, the
impression that his mother must have suffered some personal damage, pervaded
his partially developed mind, and considering Mr. Pickwick as the aggressor,
he set up an appalling and semi-earthly kind of howling, and butting forward
with his head, commenced assailing that immortal gentleman about the back
and legs, with such blows and pinches as the strength of his arm, and the
violence of his excitement, allowed.

<P>"Take this little villain away," said the agonised Mr. Pickwick, "he's
mad."

<P>"What <I>is</I> the matter?" said the three tongue-tied Pickwickians.

<P>"I don't know," replied Mr. Pickwick, pettishly. "Take away the boy"
(here Mr. Winkle carried the interesting boy, screaming and struggling,
to the further end of the apartment). "Now, help me, lead this woman down-stairs."

<P>"Oh, I am better now," said Mrs. Bardell, faintly.

<P>"Let me lead you down-stairs," said the ever-gallant Mr. Tupman.

<P>"Thank you, sir--thank you;" exclaimed Mrs. Bardell, hysterically. And
down-stairs she was lead accordingly, accompanied by her affectionate son.

<P>"I cannot conceive--" said Mr. Pickwick, when his friend returned--"I
cannot conceive what has been the matter with that woman. I had merely
announced to her my intention of keeping a man-servant, when she fell into
the extraordinary paroxysm in which you found her. Very extraordinary thing."

<P>"Very," said his three friends.

<P>"Placed me in such an extremely awkward situation," continued Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"Very," was the reply of his followers, as they coughed slightly, and
looked dubiously at each other.

<P>This behaviour was not lost upon Mr. Pickwick. He remarked their incredulity.
They evidently suspected him.

<P>"There is a man in the passage now," said Mr. Tupman.

<P>"It's the man I spoke to you about," said Mr. Pickwick. "I sent for
him up to the Borough this morning. Have the goodness to call him up, Snodgrass.

<P>Mr. Snodgrass did as he was desired; and Mr. Samuel Weller forthwith
presented himself.

<P>"Oh--you remember me, I suppose?" said Mr. Pickwick. "I should think
so," replied Sam, with a patronising wink. "Queer start that 'ere, but
he was one too many for you, warn't he? Up to snuff and a pinch or two
over--eh?"

<P>"Never mind that matter now," said Mr. Pickwick hastily. "I want to
speak to you about something else. Sit down."

<P>"Thank'ee, sir," said Sam. And down he sat without further bidding,
having previously deposited his old white hat on the landing outside the
door. "Tan't a werry good 'un to look at," said Sam, "but it's an astonishin'
'un to wear; and afore the brim went, it was a werry handsome tile. Hows'ever
it's lighter without it, that's one thing, and every hole lets in some
air, that's another--wentilation gossamer I calls it." On the delivery
of this sentiment, Mr. Weller smiled agreeably upon the assembled Pickwickians.

<P>"Now with regard to the matter on which I, with the concurrence of these
gentlemen, sent for you," said Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"That's the pint, sir," interposed Sam; "out vith it, as the father
said to the child, wen he swallowed a farden."

<P>"We want to know in the first place," said Mr. Pickwick, "whether you
have any reason to be discontented with your present situation."

<P>"Afore I answers that 'ere question, gen'l'm'n," replied Mr. Weller,
"<I>I</I> should like to know, in the first place, whether you're a goin'
to purwide me with a better?"

<P>A sunbeam of placid benevolence played on Mr. Pickwick's features as
he said, "I have half made up my mind to engage you myself."

<P>"Have you, though?" said Sam.

<P>Mr. Pickwick nodded in the affirmative.

<P>"Wages?" inquired Sam

<P>"Twelve pounds a year," replied Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"Clothes?"

<P>"Two suits."

<P>"Work?"

<P>"To attend upon me; and travel about with me and these gentlemen here."

<P>"Take the bill down," said Sam, emphatically. "I'm let to a single gentleman,
and the terms is agreed upon."

<P>"You accept the situation?" inquired Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"Cert'nly," replied Sam. "If the clothes fits me half as well as the
place, they'll do."

<P>"You can get a character of course?" said Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"Ask the landlady o' the White Hart about that, sir," replied Sam.

<P>"Can you come this evening?"

<P>"I'll get into the clothes this minute, if they're here," said Sam with
great alacrity.

<P>"Call at eight this evening," said Mr. Pickwick; "and if the inquiries
are satisfactory, they shall be provided."

<P>With the single exception of one amiable indiscretion, in which an assistant
housemaid had equally participated, the history of Mr. Weller's conduct
was so very blameless, that Mr. Pickwick felt fully justified in closing
the engagement that very evening. With the promptness and energy which
characterised not only the public proceedings, but all the private actions
of this extraordinary man, he at once led his new attendant to one of those
convenient emporiums where gentlemen's new and second-hand clothes are
provided, and the troublesome and inconvenient formality of measurement
dispensed with; and before night had closed in, Mr. Weller was furnished
with a grey coat with the P. C. button, a black hat with a cockade to it,
a pink striped waistcoat, light breeches and gaiters, and a variety of
other necessaries, too numerous to recapitulate.

<P>"Well," said that suddenly-transformed individual, as he took his seat
on the outside of the Eatanswill coach next morning; "I wonder whether
I'm meant to be a footman, or a groom, or a gamekeeper, or a seedsman.
I looks like a sort of compo of every one on 'em. Never mind; there's change
of air, plenty to see, and little to do; and all this suits my complaint
uncommon; so long life to the Pickvicks, says I!"
