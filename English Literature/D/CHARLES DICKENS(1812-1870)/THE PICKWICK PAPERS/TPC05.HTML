<CENTER><FONT SIZE=-1>A SHORT ONE. SHOWING, AMONG OTHER MATTERS, HOW MR.
PICKWICK UNDERTOOK TO DRIVE, AND MR. WINKLE TO RIDE; AND HOW THEY BOTH
DID IT</FONT></CENTER>


<P>B<FONT SIZE=-1>RIGHT</FONT> and pleasant was the sky, balmy the air,
and beautiful the appearance of every object around, as Mr. Pickwick leant
over the balustrades of Rochester Bridge, contemplating nature, and waiting
for breakfast. The scene was indeed one which might well have charmed a
far less reflective mind, than that to which it was presented.

<P>On the left of the spectator lay the ruined wall, broken in many places,
and in some, overhanging the narrow beach below in rude and heavy masses.
Huge knots of sea-weed hung upon the jagged and pointed stones, trembling
in every breath of wind; and the green ivy clung mournfully round the dark
and ruined battlements. Behind it rose the ancient castle, its towers roofless,
and its massive walls crumbling away, but telling us proudly of its own
might and strength, as when, seven hundred years ago, it rang with the
clash of arms, or resounded with the noise of feasting and revelry. On
either side, the banks of the Medway, covered with cornfields and pastures,
with here and there a windmill, or a distant church, stretched away as
far as the eye could see, presenting a rich and varied landscape, rendered
more beautiful by the changing shadows which passed swiftly across it,
as the thin and half-formed clouds skimmed away in the light of the morning
sun. The river, reflecting the clear blue of the sky, glistened and sparkled
as it flowed noiselessly on; and the oars of the fishermen dipped into
the water with a clear and liquid sound, as the heavy but picturesque boats
glided slowly down the stream.

<P>Mr. Pickwick was roused from the agreeable reverie into which he had
been led by the objects before him, by a deep sigh, and a touch on his
shoulder. He turned round: and the dismal man was at his side.

<P>"Contemplating the scene?" inquired the dismal man.

<P>"I was," said Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"And congratulating yourself on being up so soon?" Mr. Pickwick nodded
assent.

<P>"Ah! people need to rise early, to see the sun in all his splendour,
for his brightness seldom lasts the day through. The morning of day and
the morning of life are but too much alike."

<P>"You speak truly, sir," said Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"How common the saying," continued the dismal man, "`The morning's too
fine to last.' How well might it be applied to our every-day existence.
God! what would I forfeit to have the days of my childhood restored, or
to be able to forget them for ever!"

<P>"You have seen much trouble, sir," said Mr. Pickwick, compassionately.

<P>"I have," said the dismal man, hurriedly; "I have. More than those who
see me now would believe possible." He paused for an instant, and then
said, abruptly--

<P>"Did it ever strike you, on such a morning as this, that drowning would
be happiness and peace?"

<P>"God bless me, no!" replied Mr. Pickwick, edging a little from the balustrade,
as the possibility of the dismal man's tipping him over, by way of experiment,
occurred to him rather forcibly.

<P>"<I>I</I> have thought so, often," said the dismal man, without noticing
the action. "The calm, cool water seems to me to murmur an invitation to
repose and rest. A bound, a splash, a brief struggle; there is an eddy
for an instant, it gradually subsides into a gentle ripple; the waters
have closed above your head, and the world has closed upon your miseries
and misfortunes for ever." The sunken eye of the dismal man flashed brightly
as he spoke, but the momentary excitement quickly subsided; and he turned
calmly away, as he said--

<P>"There--enough of that. I wish to see you on another subject. You invited
me to read that paper, the night before last, and listened attentively
while I did so."

<P>"I did," replied Mr. Pickwick; "and I certainly thought--"

<P>"I asked for no opinion," said the dismal man, interrupting him, "and
I want none. You are travelling for amusement and instruction. Suppose
I forwarded you a curious manuscript--observe, not curious because wild
or improbable, but curious as a leaf from the romance of real life. Would
you communicate it to the club, of which you have spoken so frequently?"

<P>"Certainly," replied Mr. Pickwick, "if you wished it; and it would be
entered on their transactions."

<P>"You shall have it," replied the dismal man. "Your address;" and, Mr.
Pickwick having communicated their probable route, the dismal man carefully
noted it down in a greasy pocket-book, and, resisting Mr. Pickwick's pressing
invitation to breakfast, left that gentleman at his inn, and walked slowly
away.

<P>Mr. Pickwick found that his three companions had risen, and were waiting
his arrival to commence breakfast, which was ready laid in tempting display.
They sat down to the meal; and broiled ham, eggs, tea, coffee, and sundries,
began to disappear with a rapidity which at once bore testimony to the
excellence of the fare, and the appetites of its consumers.

<P>"Now, about Manor Farm," said Mr. Pickwick. "How shall we go?"

<P>"We had better consult the waiter, perhaps," said Mr. Tupman, and the
waiter was summoned accordingly.

<P>"Dingley Dell, gentlemen--fifteen miles, gentlemen--cross road--post-chaise,
sir?"

<P>"Post-chaise won't hold more than two," said Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"True, sir--beg your pardon, sir.--Very nice four-wheeled chaise, sir--seat
for two behind--one in front for the gentleman that drives--oh! beg your
pardon, sir--that'll only hold three."

<P>"What's to be done?" said Mr. Snodgrass.

<P>"Perhaps one of the gentlemen would like to ride, sir?" suggested the
waiter, looking towards Mr. Winkle; "very good saddle horses, sir--any
of Mr. Wardle's men coming to Rochester bring 'em back, sir."

<P>"The very thing," said Mr. Pickwick. "Winkle, will you go on horseback?"

<P>Mr. Winkle did entertain considerable misgivings in the very lowest
recesses of his own heart, relative to his equestrian skill; but, as he
would not have them even suspected on any account, he at once replied with
great hardihood, "Certainly. I should enjoy it, of all things."

<P>Mr. Winkle had rushed upon his fate; there was no resource. "Let them
be at the door by eleven," said Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"Very well, sir," replied the waiter.

<P>The waiter retired; the breakfast concluded; and the travellers ascended
to their respective bed-rooms, to prepare a change of clothing, to take
with them on their approaching expedition.

<P>Mr. Pickwick had made his preliminary arrangements, and was looking
over the coffee-room blinds at the passengers in the street, when the waiter
entered, and announced that the chaise was ready--an announcement which
the vehicle itself confirmed, by forthwith appearing before the coffee-room
blinds aforesaid.

<P>It was a curious little green box on four wheels, with a low place like
a wine-bin for two behind, and an elevated perch for one in front, drawn
by an immense brown horse, displaying great symmetry of bone. An hostler
stood near, holding by the bridle another immense horse--apparently a near
relative of the animal in the chaise--ready saddled for Mr. Winkle.

<P>"Bless my soul!" said Mr. Pickwick, as they stood upon the pavement
while the coats were being put in. "Bless my soul! who's to drive? I never
thought of that."

<P>"Oh! you, of course," said Mr. Tupman.

<P>"Of course," said Mr. Snodgrass.

<P>"I!" exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"Not the slightest fear, sir," interposed the hostler. "Warrant him
quiet, sir; a hinfant in arms might drive him."

<P>"He don't shy, does he?" inquired Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"Shy, sir?--He wouldn't shy if he was to meet a vaggin-load of monkeys
with their tails burnt off."

<P>The last recommendation was indisputable. Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass
got into the bin; Mr. Pickwick ascended to his perch, and deposited his
feet on a floor-clothed shelf, erected beneath it for that purpose.

<P>"Now, shiny Villiam," said the hostler to the deputy hostler, "give
the gen'l'm'n the ribbins." "Shiny Villiam"--so called, probably, from
his sleek hair and oily countenance--placed the reins in Mr. Pickwick's
left hand; and the upper hostler thrust a whip into his right.

<P>"Wo--o!" cried Mr. Pickwick, as the tall quadruped evinced a decided
inclination to back into the coffee-room window.

<P>"Wo--o!" echoed Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass, from the bin.

<P>"Only his playfulness, gen'l'm'n," said the head hostler encouragingly;
"jist kitch hold on him, Villiam." The deputy restrained the animal's impetuosity,
and the principal ran to assist Mr. Winkle in mounting.

<P>"T'other side, sir, if you please."

<P>"Blowed if the gen'l'm'n worn't a gettin' up on the wrong side," whispered
a grinning post-boy to the inexpressibly gratified waiter.

<P>Mr. Winkle, thus instructed, climbed into his saddle, with about as
much difficulty as he would have experienced in getting up the side of
a first-rate man-of-war.

<P>"All right?" inquired Mr. Pickwick, with an inward presentiment that
it was all wrong.

<P>"All right," replied Mr. Winkle faintly.

<P>"Let 'em go," cried the hostler,--"Hold him in, sir," and away went
the chaise, and the saddle-horse, with Mr. Pickwick on the box of the one,
and Mr. Winkle on the back of the other, to the delight and gratification
of the whole inn yard.

<P>"What makes him go sideways?" said Mr. Snodgrass in the bin, to Mr.
Winkle in the saddle.

<P>"I can't imagine," replied Mr. Winkle. His horse was drifting up the
street in the most mysterious manner--side first, with his head towards
one side of the way, and his tail towards the other.

<P>Mr. Pickwick had no leisure to observe either this or any other particular,
the whole of his faculties being concentrated in the management of the
animal attached to the chaise, who displayed various peculiarities, highly
interesting to a bystander, but by no means equally amusing to any one
seated behind him. Besides constantly jerking his head up, in a very unpleasant
and uncomfortable manner, and tugging at the reins to an extent which rendered
it a matter of great difficulty for Mr. Pickwick to hold them, he had a
singular propensity for darting suddenly every now and then to the side
of the road, then stopping short, and then rushing forward for some minutes,
at a speed which it was wholly impossible to control.

<P>"What <I>can</I> he mean by this?" said Mr. Snodgrass, when the horse
had executed this manoeuvre for the twentieth time.

<P>"I don't know," replied Mr. Tupman; "it <I>looks</I> very like shying,
don't it?" Mr. Snodgrass was about to reply, when he was interrupted by
a shout from Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"Woo!" said that gentleman; "I have dropped my whip."

<P>"Winkle," said Mr. Snodgrass, as the equestrian came trotting up on
the tall horse, with his hat over his ears, and shaking all over, as if
he would shake to pieces, with the violence of the exercise, "pick up the
whip, there's a good fellow." Mr. Winkle pulled at the bridle of the tall
horse till he was black in the face; and having at length succeeded in
stopping him, dismounted, handed the whip to Mr. Pickwick, and grasping
the reins, prepared to remount.

<P>Now whether the tall horse, in the natural playfulness of his disposition,
was desirous of having a little innocent recreation with Mr. Winkle, or
whether it occurred to him that he could perform the journey as much to
his own satisfaction without a rider as with one, are points upon which,
of course, we can arrive at no definite and distinct conclusion. By whatever
motives the animal was actuated, certain it is that Mr. Winkle had no sooner
touched the reins, than he slipped them over his head, and darted backwards
to their full length.

<P>"Poor fellow," said Mr. Winkle, soothingly,--"poor fellow--good old
horse." The "poor fellow" was proof against flattery: the more Mr. Winkle
tried to get nearer him, the more he sidled away; and, notwithstanding
all kinds of coaxing and wheedling, there were Mr. Winkle and the horse
going round and round each other for ten minutes, at the end of which time
each was at precisely the same distance from the other as when they first
commenced--an unsatisfactory sort of thing under any circumstances, but
particularly so in a lonely road, where no assistance can be procured.

<P>"What am I to do?" shouted Mr. Winkle, after the dodging had been prolonged
for a considerable time. "What am I to do? I can't get on him."

<P>"You had better lead him till we come to a turnpike," replied Mr. Pickwick
from the chaise.

<P>"But he won't come!" roared Mr. Winkle. "Do come, and hold him."

<P>Mr. Pickwick was the very personation of kindness and humanity: he threw
the reins on the horse's back, and having descended from his seat, carefully
drew the chaise into the hedge, lest anything should come along the road,
and stepped back to the assistance of his distressed companion, leaving
Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass in the vehicle. The horse no sooner beheld
Mr. Pickwick advancing towards him with the chaise whip in his hand, than
he exchanged the rotary motion in which he had previously indulged, for
a retrograde movement of so very determined a character, that it at once
drew Mr. Winkle, who was still at the end of the bridle, at a rather quicker
rate than fast walking, in the direction from which they had just come.
Mr. Pickwick ran to his assistance, but the faster Mr. Pickwick ran forward,
the faster the horse ran backward. There was a great scraping of feet,
and kicking up of the dust; and at last Mr. Winkle, his arms being nearly
pulled out of their sockets, fairly let go his hold. The horse paused,
stared, shook his head, turned round, and quietly trotted home to Rochester,
leaving Mr. Winkle and Mr. Pickwick gazing on each other with countenances
of blank dismay. A rattling noise at a little distance attracted their
attention. They looked up.

<P>"Bless my soul!" exclaimed the agonised Mr. Pickwick, "there's the other
horse running away!"

<P>It was but too true. The animal was startled by the noise, and the reins
were on his back. The result may be guessed. He tore off with the four-wheeled
chaise behind him, and Mr. Tupman and Mr. Snodgrass in the four-wheeled
chaise. The heat was a short one. Mr. Tupman threw himself into the hedge,
Mr. Snodgrass followed his example, the horse dashed the four-wheeled chaise
against a wooden bridge, separated the wheels from the body, and the bin
from the perch: and finally stood stock still to gaze upon the ruin he
had made.

<P>The first care of the two unspilt friends was to extricate their unfortunate
companions from their bed of quickset--a process which gave them the unspeakable
satisfaction of discovering that they had sustained no injury, beyond sundry
rents in their garments, and various lacerations from the brambles. The
next thing to be done was, to unharness the horse. This complicated process
having been effected, the party walked slowly forward, leading the horse
among them, and abandoning the chaise to its fate.

<P>An hour's walking brought the travellers to a little roadside public-house,
with two elm trees, a horse trough, and a sign-post, in front; one or two
deformed hay-ricks behind, a kitchen garden at the side, and rotten sheds
and mouldering out-houses jumbled in strange confusion all about it. A
red-headed man was working in the garden; and to him Mr. Pickwick called
lustily--"Hallo there!"

<P>The red-headed man raised his body, shaded his eyes with his hand, and
stared, long and coolly, at Mr. Pickwick and his companions.

<P>"Hallo there!" repeated Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"Hallo!" was the red-headed man's reply.

<P>"How far is it to Dingley Dell?"

<P>"Better er seven mile."

<P>"Is it a good road?"

<P>"No t'ant." Having uttered this brief reply, and apparently satisfied
himself with another scrutiny, the red-headed man resumed his work.

<P>"We want to put this horse up here," said Mr. Pickwick; "I suppose we
can, can't we?"

<P>"Want to put that ere horse up, do ee?" repeated the red-headed man,
leaning on his spade.

<P>"Of course," replied Mr. Pickwick, who had by this time advanced, horse
in hand, to the garden rails.

<P>"Missus"--roared the man with the red head, emerging from the garden,
and looking very hard at the horse--"Missus!"

<P>A tall bony woman--straight all the way down--in a coarse blue pelisse,
with the waist an inch or two below her arm-pits, responded to the call.

<P>"Can we put this horse up here, my good woman?" said Mr. Tupman, advancing,
and speaking in his most seductive tones. The woman looked very hard at
the whole party; and the red-headed man whispered something in her ear.

<P>"No," replied the woman, after a little consideration, "I'm afeered
on it."

<P>"Afraid!" exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, "what's the woman afraid of?"

<P>"It got us in trouble last time," said the woman, turning into the house;
"I woant have nothin' to say to 'un."

<P>"Most extraordinary thing I ever met with in my life," said the astonished
Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"I--I--really believe," whispered Mr. Winkle, as his friends gathered
round him, "that they think we have come by this horse in some dishonest
manner."

<P>"What!" exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, in a storm of indignation. Mr. Winkle
modestly repeated his suggestion.

<P>"Hallo, you fellow!" said the angry Mr. Pickwick, "do you think we stole
this horse?"

<P>"I'm sure ye did," replied the red-headed man, with a grin which agitated
his countenance from one auricular organ to the other. Saying which, he
turned into the house, and banged the door after him.

<P>"It's like a dream," ejaculated Mr. Pickwick, "a hideous dream. The
idea of a man's walking about, all day, with a dreadful horse that he can't
get rid of!" The depressed Pickwickians turned moodily away, with the tall
quadruped, for which they all felt the most unmitigated disgust, following
slowly at their heels.

<P>It was late in the afternoon when the four friends and their four-footed
companion turned into the lane leading to Manor Farm: and even when they
were so near their place of destination, the pleasure they would otherwise
have experienced was materially damped as they reflected on the singularity
of their appearance, and the absurdity of their situation. Torn clothes,
lacerated faces, dusty shoes, exhausted looks, and, above all, the horse.
Oh, how Mr. Pickwick cursed that horse: he had eyed the noble animal from
time to time with looks expressive of hatred and revenge; more than once
he had calculated the probable amount of the expense he would incur by
cutting his throat; and now the temptation to destroy him, or to cast him
loose upon the world, rushed upon his mind with tenfold force. He was roused
from a meditation on these dire imaginings, by the sudden appearance of
two figures at a turn of the lane. It was Mr. Wardle, and his faithful
attendant, the fat boy.

<P>"Why, where <I>have</I> you been?" said the hospitable old gentleman;
"I've been waiting for you all day. Well, you <I>do</I> look tired. What!
Scratches! Not hurt, I hope--eh? Well, I <I>am</I> glad to hear that--very.
So you've been spilt, eh? Never mind. Common accident in these parts. Joe--he's
asleep again!--Joe, take that horse from the gentleman, and lead it into
the stable."

<P>The fat boy sauntered heavily behind them with the animal; and the old
gentleman, condoling with his guests in homely phrase on so much of the
day's adventures as they thought proper to communicate, led the way to
the kitchen.

<P>"We'll have you put to rights here," said the old gentleman, "and then
I'll introduce you to the people in the parlour. Emma, bring out the cherry
brandy; now, Jane, a needle and thread here; towels and water, Mary. Come,
girls, bustle about."

<P>Three or four buxom girls speedily dispersed in search of the different
articles in requisition, while a couple of large-headed, circular-visaged
males rose from their seats in the chimney-corner (for although it was
a May evening, their attachment to the wood fire appeared as cordial as
if it were Christmas), and dived into some obscure recesses, from which
they speedily produced a bottle of blacking, and some half-dozen brushes.

<P>"Bustle!" said the old gentleman again, but the admonition was quite
unnecessary, for one of the girls poured out the cherry brandy, and another
brought in the towels, and one of the men suddenly seizing Mr. Pickwick
by the leg, at imminent hazard of throwing him off his balance, brushed
away at his boot, till his corns were red-hot; while the other shampoo'd
Mr. Winkle with a heavy clothes-brush, indulging, during the operation,
in that hissing sound which hostlers are wont to produce when engaged in
rubbing down a horse.

<P>Mr. Snodgrass, having concluded his ablutions, took a survey of the
room, while standing with his back to the fire, sipping his cherry brandy
with heartfelt satisfaction. He describes it as a large apartment, with
a red brick floor and a capacious chimney; the ceiling garnished with hams,
sides of bacon, and ropes of onions. The walls were decorated with several
hunting-whips, two or three bridles, a saddle and an old rusty blunderbuss,
with an inscription below it, intimating that it was "Loaded"--as it had
been, on the same authority, for half a century at least. An old eight-day
clock, of solemn and sedate demeanour, ticked gravely in one corner; and
a silver watch, of equal antiquity, dangled from one of the many hooks
which ornamented the dresser.

<P>"Ready?" said the old gentleman inquiringly, when his guests had been
washed, mended, brushed, and brandied.

<P>"Quite," replied Mr. Pickwick.

<P>"Come along, then," and the party having traversed severa dark passages,
and being joined by Mr. Tupman, who had lingered behind to snatch a kiss
from Emma, for which he had been duly rewarded with sundry pushings and
scratchings, arrived at the parlour door.

<P>"Welcome," said their hospitable host, throwing it open and stepping
forward to announce them, "Welcome, gentlemen, to Manor Farm."
