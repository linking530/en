THE VOICE OF SOCIETY





Behoves Mortimer Lightwood, therefore, to answer a dinner card

from Mr and Mrs Veneering requesting the honour, and to signify

that Mr Mortimer Lightwood will be happy to have the other

honour.  The Veneerings have been, as usual, indefatigably dealing

dinner cards to Society, and whoever desires to take a hand had

best be quick about it, for it is written in the Books of the Insolvent

Fates that Veneering shall make a resounding smash next week.

Yes.  Having found out the clue to that great mystery how people

can contrive to live beyond their means, and having over-jobbed

his jobberies as legislator deputed to the Universe by the pure

electors of Pocket-Breaches, it shall come to pass next week that

Veneering will accept the Chiltern Hundreds, that the legal

gentleman in Britannia's confidence will again accept the Pocket-

Breaches Thousands, and that the Veneerings will retire to Calais,

there to live on Mrs Veneering's diamonds (in which Mr

Veneering, as a good husband, has from time to time invested

considerable sums), and to relate to Neptune and others, how that,

before Veneering retired from Parliament, the House of Commons

was composed of himself and the six hundred and fifty-seven

dearest and oldest friends he had in the world.  It shall likewise

come to pass, at as nearly as possible the same period, that Society

will discover that it always did despise Veneering, and distrust

Veneering, and that when it went to Veneering's to dinner it

always had misgivings--though very secretly at the time, it would

seem, and in a perfectly private and confidential manner.



The next week's books of the Insolvent Fates, however, being not

yet opened, there is the usual rush to the Veneerings, of the people

who go to their house to dine with one another and not with them.

There is Lady Tippins.  There are Podsnap the Great, and Mrs

Podsnap.  There is Twemlow.  There are Buffer, Boots, and

Brewer.  There is the Contractor, who is Providence to five

hundred thousand men.  There is the Chairman, travelling three

thousand miles per week.  There is the brilliant genius who turned

the shares into that remarkably exact sum of three hundred and

seventy five thousand pounds, no shillings, and nopence.



To whom, add Mortimer Lightwood, coming in among them with

a reassumption of his old languid air, founded on Eugene, and

belonging to the days when he told the story of the man from

Somewhere.



That fresh fairy, Tippins, all but screams at sight of her false

swain.  She summons the deserter to her with her fan; but the

deserter, predetermined not to come, talks Britain with Podsnap.

Podsnap always talks Britain, and talks as if he were a sort of

Private Watchman employed, in the British interests, against the

rest of the world.  'We know what Russia means, sir,' says

Podsnap; 'we know what France wants; we see what America is up

to; but we know what England is.  That's enough for us.'



However, when dinner is served, and Lightwood drops into his old

place over against Lady Tippins, she can be fended off no longer.

'Long banished Robinson Crusoe,' says the charmer, exchanging

salutations, 'how did you leave the Island?'



'Thank you,' says Lightwood.  'It made no complaint of being in

pain anywhere.'



'Say, how did you leave the savages?' asks Lady Tippins.



'They were becoming civilized when I left Juan Fernandez,' says

Lightwood.  'At least they were eating one another, which looked

like it.'



'Tormentor!' returns the dear young creature.  'You know what I

mean, and you trifle with my impatience.  Tell me something,

immediately, about the married pair.  You were at the wedding.'



'Was I, by-the-by?' Mortimer pretends, at great leisure, to consider.

'So I was!'



'How was the bride dressed?  In rowing costume?'



Mortimer looks gloomy, and declines to answer.



'I hope she steered herself, skiffed herself, paddled herself,

larboarded and starboarded herself, or whatever the technical term

may be, to the ceremony?' proceeds the playful Tippins.



'However she got to it, she graced it,' says Mortimer.



Lady Tippins with a skittish little scream, attracts the general

attention.  'Graced it!  Take care of me if I faint, Veneering.  He

means to tell us, that a horrid female waterman is graceful!'



'Pardon me.  I mean to tell you nothing, Lady Tippins,' replies

Lightwood.  And keeps his word by eating his dinner with a show

of the utmost indifference.



'You shall not escape me in this way, you morose

backwoodsman,' retorts Lady Tippins.  'You shall not evade the

question, to screen your friend Eugene, who has made this

exhibition of himself.  The knowledge shall be brought home to

you that such a ridiculous affair is condemned by the voice of

Society.  My dear Mrs Veneering, do let us resolve ourselves into

a Committee of the whole House on the subject.'



Mrs Veneering, always charmed by this rattling sylph, cries.  'Oh

yes!  Do let us resolve ourselves into a Committee of the whole

House!  So delicious!'  Veneering says, 'As many as are of that

opinion, say Aye,--contrary, No--the Ayes have it.'  But nobody

takes the slightest notice of his joke.



'Now, I am Chairwoman of Committees!' cries Lady Tippins.



('What spirits she has!' exclaims Mrs Veneering; to whom likewise

nobody attends.)



'And this,' pursues the sprightly one, 'is a Committee of the whole

House to what-you-may-call-it--elicit, I suppose--the voice of

Society.  The question before the Committee is, whether a young

man of very fair family, good appearance, and some talent, makes

a fool or a wise man of himself in marrying a female waterman,

turned factory girl.'



'Hardly so, I think,' the stubborn Mortimer strikes in.  'I take the

question to be, whether such a man as you describe, Lady Tippins,

does right or wrong in marrying a brave woman (I say nothing of

her beauty), who has saved his life, with a wonderful energy and

address; whom he knows to be virtuous, and possessed of

remarkable qualities; whom he has long admired, and who is

deeply attached to him.'



'But, excuse me,' says Podsnap, with his temper and his shirt-collar

about equally rumpled; 'was this young woman ever a female

waterman?'



'Never.  But she sometimes rowed in a boat with her father, I

believe.'



General sensation against the young woman.  Brewer shakes his

head.  Boots shakes his head.  Buffer shakes his head.



'And now, Mr Lightwood, was she ever,' pursues Podsnap, with

his indignation rising high into those hair-brushes of his, 'a factory

girl?'



'Never.  But she had some employment in a paper mill, I believe.'



General sensation repeated.  Brewer says, 'Oh dear!'  Boots says,

'Oh dear!'  Buffer says, 'Oh dear!'  All, in a rumbling tone of

protest.



'Then all I have to say is,' returns Podsnap, putting the thing away

with his right arm, 'that my gorge rises against such a marriage--

that it offends and disgusts me--that it makes me sick--and that I

desire to know no more about it.'



('Now I wonder,' thinks Mortimer, amused, 'whether YOU are the

Voice of Society!')



'Hear, hear, hear!' cries Lady Tippins.  'Your opinion of this

MESALLIANCE, honourable colleagues of the honourable

member who has just sat down?'



Mrs Podsnap is of opinion that in these matters there should be an

equality of station and fortune, and that a man accustomed to

Society should look out for a woman accustomed to Society and

capable of bearing her part in it with--an ease and elegance of

carriage--that.'  Mrs Podsnap stops there, delicately intimating

that every such man should look out for a fine woman as nearly

resembling herself as he may hope to discover.



('Now I wonder,' thinks Mortimer, 'whether you are the Voice!')



Lady Tippins next canvasses the Contractor, of five hundred

thousand power.  It appears to this potentate, that what the man in

question should have done, would have been, to buy the young

woman a boat and a small annuity, and set her up for herself.

These things are a question of beefsteaks and porter.  You buy the

young woman a boat.  Very good.  You buy her, at the same time,

a small annuity.  You speak of that annuity in pounds sterling, but

it is in reality so many pounds of beefsteaks and so many pints of

porter.  On the one hand, the young woman has the boat.  On the

other hand, she consumes so many pounds of beefsteaks and so

many pints of porter.  Those beefsteaks and that porter are the fuel

to that young woman's engine.  She derives therefrom a certain

amount of power to row the boat; that power will produce so much

money; you add that to the small annuity; and thus you get at the

young woman's income.  That (it seems to the Contractor) is the

way of looking at it.



The fair enslaver having fallen into one of her gentle sleeps during

the last exposition, nobody likes to wake her.  Fortunately, she

comes awake of herself, and puts the question to the Wandering

Chairman.  The Wanderer can only speak of the case as if it were

his own.  If such a young woman as the young woman described,

had saved his own life, he would have been very much obliged to

her, wouldn't have married her, and would have got her a berth in

an Electric Telegraph Office, where young women answer very

well.



What does the Genius of the three hundred and seventy-five

thousand pounds, no shillings, and nopence, think?  He can't say

what he thinks, without asking: Had the young woman any

money?



'No,' says Lightwood, in an uncompromising voice; 'no money.'



'Madness and moonshine,' is then the compressed verdict of the

Genius.  'A man may do anything lawful, for money.  But for no

money!--Bosh!'



What does Boots say?



Boots says he wouldn't have done it under twenty thousand pound.



What does Brewer say?



Brewer says what Boots says.



What does Buffer say?



Buffer says he knows a man who married a bathing-woman, and

bolted.



Lady Tippins fancies she has collected the suffrages of the whole

Committee (nobody dreaming of asking the Veneerings for their

opinion), when, looking round the table through her eyeglass, she

perceives Mr Twemlow with his hand to his forehead.



Good gracious!  My Twemlow forgotten!  My dearest!  My own!

What is his vote?



Twemlow has the air of being ill at ease, as he takes his hand from

his forehead and replies.



'I am disposed to think,' says he, 'that this is a question of the

feelings of a gentleman.'



'A gentleman can have no feelings who contracts such a marriage,'

flushes Podsnap.



'Pardon me, sir,' says Twemlow, rather less mildly than usual, 'I

don't agree with you.  If this gentleman's feelings of gratitude, of

respect, of admiration, and affection, induced him (as I presume

they did) to marry this lady--'



'This lady!' echoes Podsnap.



'Sir,' returns Twemlow, with his wristbands bristling a little, 'YOU

repeat the word; I repeat the word.  This lady.  What else would

you call her, if the gentleman were present?'



This being something in the nature of a poser for Podsnap, he

merely waves it away with a speechless wave.



'I say,' resumes Twemlow, 'if such feelings on the part of this

gentleman, induced this gentleman to marry this lady, I think he is

the greater gentleman for the action, and makes her the greater

lady.  I beg to say, that when I use the word, gentleman, I use it in

the sense in which the degree may be attained by any man.  The

feelings of a gentleman I hold sacred, and I confess I am not

comfortable when they are made the subject of sport or general

discussion.'



'I should like to know,' sneers Podsnap, 'whether your noble

relation would be of your opinion.'



'Mr Podsnap,' retorts Twemlow, 'permit me.  He might be, or he

might not be.  I cannot say.  But, I could not allow even him to

dictate to me on a point of great delicacy, on which I feel very

strongly.'



Somehow, a canopy of wet blanket seems to descend upon the

company, and Lady Tippins was never known to turn so very

greedy or so very cross.  Mortimer Lightwood alone brightens.

He has been asking himself, as to every other member of the

Committee in turn, 'I wonder whether you are the Voice!'  But he

does not ask himself the question after Twemlow has spoken, and

he glances in Twemlow's direction as if he were grateful.  When

the company disperse--by which time Mr and Mrs Veneering have

had quite as much as they want of the honour, and the guests have

had quite as much as THEY want of the other honour--Mortimer

sees Twemlow home, shakes hands with him cordially at parting,

and fares to the Temple, gaily.
