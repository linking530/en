CHAPTER I</H3>

<H3>
Dombey and Son</H3>
DOMBEY sat in the corner of the darkened room in the great arm-chair by
the bedside, and Son lay tucked up warm in a little basket bedstead, carefully
disposed on a low settee immediately in front of the fire and close to
it, as if his constitution were analogous to that of a muffin, and it was
essential to toast him brown while he was very new.

<P>&nbsp;Dombey was about eight-and-forty years of age. Son about eight-and-forty
minutes. Dombey was rather bald, rather red, and though a handsome well-made
man, too stern and pompous in appearance, to be prepossessing. Son was
very bald, and very red, and though (of course) an undeniably fine infant,
somewhat crushed and spotty in his general effect, as yet. On the brow
of Dombey, Time and his brother Care had set some marks, as on a tree that
was to come down in good time--remorseless twins they are for striding
through their human forests, notching as they go--while the countenance
of Son was crossed and recrossed with a thousand little creases, which
the same deceitful Time would take delight in smoothing out and wearing
away with the flat part of his scythe, as a preparation of the surface
for his deeper operations.

<P>&nbsp;Dombey, exulting in the long-looked-for event, jingled and jingled
the heavy gold watch-chain that depended from below his trim blue coat,
whereof the buttons sparkled phosphorescently in the feeble rays of the
distant fire. Son, with his little fists curled up and clenched, seemed,
in his feeble way, to be squaring at existence for having come upon him
so unexpectedly.

<P>&nbsp;`The house will once again, Mrs. Dombey,' said Mr. Dombey, `be
not only in name but in fact Dombey and Son; Dom-bey and Son!'

<P>&nbsp;The words had such a softening influence, that he appended a term
of endearment to Mrs. Dombey's name (though not without some hesitation,
as being a man but little used to that form of address): and said, `Mrs.
Dombey, my--my dear.'

<P>&nbsp;A transient flush of faint surprise overspread the sick lady's
face as she raised her eyes towards him.

<P>&nbsp;`He will be christened Paul, my--Mrs. Dombey--of course.'

<P>&nbsp;She feebly echoed, `Of course,' or rather expressed it by the
motion of her lips, and closed her eyes again.

<P>&nbsp;`His father's name, Mrs. Dombey, and his grandfather's! I wish
his grandfather were alive this day!' And again he said `Dom-bey and Son,'
in exactly the same tone as before.

<P>&nbsp;Those three words conveyed the one idea of Mr. Dombey's life.
The earth was made for Dombey and Son to trade in, and the sun and moon
were made to give them light. Rivers and seas were formed to float their
ships; rainbows gave them promise of fair weather; winds blew for or against
their enterprises; stars and planets circled in their orbits, to preserve
inviolate a system of which they were the centre. Common abbreviations
took new meanings in his eyes, and had sole reference to them: A.D. had
no concern with anno Domini, but stood for anno Dombei--and Son.

<P>&nbsp;He had risen, as his father had before him, in the course of life
and death, from Son to Dombey, and for nearly twenty years had been the
sole representative of the firm. Of those years he had been married, ten--married,
as some said, to a lady with no heart to give him; whose happiness was
in the past, and who was content to bind her broken spirit to the dutiful
and meek endurance of the present. Such idle talk was little likely to
reach the ears of Mr. Dombey, whom it nearly concerned; and probably no
one in the world would have received it with such utter incredulity as
he, if it had reached him. Dombey and Son had often dealt in hides, but
never in hearts. They left that fancy ware to boys and girls, and boarding-schools
and books. Mr. Dombey would have reasoned: That a matrimonial alliance
with himself <I>must</I>, in the nature of things, be gratifying and honourable
to any woman of common sense. That the hope of giving birth to a new partner
in such a house, could not fail to awaken a glorious and stirring ambition
in the breast of the least ambitious of her sex. That Mrs. Dombey had entered
on that social contract of matrimony: almost necessarily part of a genteel
and wealthy station, even without reference to the perpetuation of family
firms: with her eyes fully open to these advantages. That Mrs. Dombey had
had daily practical knowledge of his position in society. That Mrs. Dombey
had always sat at the head of his table, and done the honours of his house
in a remarkably lady-like and becoming manner. That Mrs. Dombey must have
been happy. That she couldn't help it.

<P>&nbsp;Or, at all events, with one drawback. Yes. That he would have
allowed. With only one; but that one certainly involving much. They had
been married ten years, and until this present day on which Mr. Dombey
sat jingling and jingling his heavy gold watch-chain in the great arm-chair
by the side of the bed, had had no issue.

<P>&nbsp;--To speak of; none worth mentioning. There had been a girl some
six years before, and the child, who had stolen into the chamber unobserved,
was now crouching timidly, in a corner whence she could see her mother's
face. But what was a girl to Dombey and Son! In the capital of the House's
name and dignity, such a child was merely a piece of base coin that couldn't
be invested--a bad Boy--nothing more.

<P>&nbsp;Mr. Dombey's cup of satisfaction was so full at this moment, however,
that he felt he could afford a drop or two of its contents, even to sprinkle
on the dust in the by-path of his little daughter.

<P>&nbsp;So he said, `Florence, you may go and look at your pretty brother,
if you like, I dare say. Don't touch him!'

<P>&nbsp;The child glanced keenly at the blue coat and stiff white cravat,
which, with a pair of creaking boots and a very loud ticking watch, embodied
her idea of a father; but her eyes returned to her mother's face immediately,
and she neither moved nor answered.

<P>&nbsp;Next moment, the lady had opened her eyes and seen the child;
and the child had run towards her; and, standing on tip-toe, the better
to hide her face in her embrace, had clung about her with a desperate affection
very much at variance with her years.

<P>&nbsp;`Oh Lord bless me!' said Mr. Dombey, rising testily. `A very ill-advised
and feverish proceeding this, I am sure. I had better ask Doctor Peps if
he'll have the goodness to step up stairs again perhaps. I'll go down.
I'll go down. I needn't beg you,' he added, pausing for a moment at the
settee before the fire, `to take particular care of this young gentleman,
Mrs.---'

<P>&nbsp;`Blockitt, Sir?' suggested the nurse, a simpering piece of faded
gentility, who did not presume to state her name as a fact, but merely
offered it as a mild suggestion.

<P>&nbsp;`Of this young gentleman, Mrs. Blockitt.'

<P>&nbsp;`No, Sir, indeed. I remember when Miss Florence was born--'

<P>&nbsp;`Ay, ay, ay,' said Mr. Dombey, bending over the basket bedstead,
and slightly bending his brows at the same time. `Miss Florence was all
very well, but this is another matter. This young gentleman has to accomplish
a destiny. A destiny, little fellow!' As he thus apostrophised the infant
he raised one of his hands to his lips, and kissed it; then, seeming to
fear that the action involved some compromise of his dignity, went, awkwardly
enough, away.

<P>&nbsp;Doctor Parker Peps, one of the Court Physicians, and a man of
immense reputation for assisting at the increase of great families, was
walking up and down the drawing-room with his hands behind him, to the
unspeakable admiration of the family Surgeon, who had regularly puffed
the case for the last six weeks, among all his patients, friends, and acquaintances,
as one to which he was in hourly expectation day and night of being summoned,
in conjunction with Doctor Parker Peps.

<P>&nbsp;`Well, Sir,' said Doctor Parker Peps in a round, deep, sonorous
voice, muffled for the occasion, like the knocker; `do you find that your
dear lady is at all roused by your visit?'

<P>&nbsp;`Stimulated as it were?' said the family practitioner faintly:
bowing at the same time to the Doctor, as much as to say, `Excuse my putting
in a word, but this is a valuable connexion.'

<P>&nbsp;Mr. Dombey was quite discomfited by the question. He had thought
so little of the patient, that he was not in a condition to answer it.
He said that it would be a satisfaction to him, if Doctor Parker Peps would
walk up stairs again.

<P>&nbsp;`Good! We must not disguise from you, Sir,' said Doctor Parker
Peps, `that there is a want of power in Her Grace the Duchess--I beg your
pardon; I confound names; I should say, in your amiable lady. That there
is a certain degree of languor, and a general absence of elasticity, which
we would rather--not--'

<P>&nbsp;`See,' interposed the family practitioner with another inclination
of the head.

<P>&nbsp;`Quite so,' said Doctor Parker Peps, `which we would rather not
see. It would appear that the system of Lady Cankaby--excuse me: I should
say of Mrs. Dombey: I confuse the names of cases--'

<P>&nbsp;`So very numerous,' murmured the family practitioner--`can't be
expected I'm sure--quite wonderful if otherwise--Doctor Parker Peps's West-End
practice--'

<P>&nbsp;`Thank you,' said the Doctor, `quite so. It would appear, I was
observing, that the system of our patient has sustained a shock, from which
it can only hope to rally by a great and strong--'

<P>`And vigorous,' murmured the family practitioner.

<P>&nbsp;`Quite so,' assented the Doctor--`and vigorous effort. Mr. Pilkins
here, who from his position of medical adviser in this family--no one better
qualified to fill that position, I am sure.'

<P>&nbsp;`Oh!' murmured the family practitioner. `"Praise from Sir Hubert
Stanley!"'

<P>&nbsp;`You are good enough,' returned Doctor Parker Peps, `to say so.
Mr. Pilkins who, from his position, is best acquainted with the patient's
constitution in its normal state (an acquaintance very valuable to us in
forming our opinions on these occasions), is of opinion, with me, that
Nature must be called upon to make a vigorous effort in this instance;
and that if our interesting friend the Countess of Dombey--I <I>beg</I>
your pardon; Mrs. Dombey--should not be--'

<P>&nbsp;`Able,' said the family practitioner.

<P>&nbsp;`To make that effort successfully,' said Doctor Parker Peps, `then
a crisis might arise, which we should both sincerely deplore.'

<P>&nbsp;With that, they stood for a few seconds looking at the ground.
Then, on the motion--made in dumb show--of Doctor Parker Peps, they went
up stairs; the family practitioner opening the room door for that distinguished
professional, and following him out, with most obsequious politeness.

<P>&nbsp;To record of Mr. Dombey that he was not in his way affected by
this intelligence, would be to do him an injustice. He was not a man of
whom it could properly be said that he was ever startled or shocked; but
he certainly had a sense within him, that if his wife should sicken and
decay, he would be very sorry, and that he would find a something gone
from among his plate and furniture, and other household possessions, which
was well worth the having, and could not be lost without sincere regret.
Though it would be a cool, business-like, gentlemanly, self-possessed regret,
no doubt.

<P>&nbsp;His meditations on the subject were soon interrupted, first by
the rustling of garments on the staircase, and then by the sudden whisking
into the room of a lady rather past the middle age than otherwise, but
dressed in a very juvenile manner, particularly as to the tightness of
her bodice, who, running up to him with a kind of screw in her face and
carriage, expressive of suppressed emotion, flung her arms round his neck,
and said in a choking voice,

<P>&nbsp;`My dear Paul! He's quite a Dombey!'

<P>&nbsp;`Well, well!' returned her brother--for Mr. Dombey was her brother--`I
think he <I>is</I> like the family. Don't agitate yourself, Louisa.'

<P>&nbsp;`It's very foolish of me,' said Louisa, sitting down, and taking
out her pocket-handkerchief, `but he's--he's such a perfect Dombey! <I>I</I>
never saw anything like it in my life!'

<P>&nbsp;`But what is this about Fanny, herself?' said Mr. Dombey. `How
is Fanny?'

<P>&nbsp;`My dear Paul,' returned Louisa, `it's nothing whatever. Take
my word, it's nothing whatever. There is exhaustion, certainly, but nothing
like what I underwent myself, either with George or Frederick. An effort
is necessary. That's all. If dear Fanny were a Dombey!--But I dare say
she'll make it; I have no doubt she'll make it. Knowing it to be required
of her, as a duty, of course she'll make it. My dear Paul, it's very weak
and silly of me, I know, to be so trembly and shaky from head to foot;
but I am so very queer that I must ask you for a glass of wine and a morsel
of that cake. I thought I should have fallen out of the staircase window
as I came down from seeing dear Fanny, and that tiddy ickle sing.' These
last words originated in a sudden vivid reminiscence of the baby.

<P>&nbsp;They were succeeded by a gentle tap at the door.

<P>&nbsp;`Mrs. Chick,' said a very bland female voice outside, `how are
you now, my dear friend?'

<P>&nbsp;`My dear Paul,' said Louisa in a low voice, as she rose from her
seat, `it's Miss Tox. The kindest creature! I never could have got here
without her! Miss Tox, my brother Mr. Dombey. Paul, my dear, my very particular
friend Miss Tox.'

<P>&nbsp;The lady thus specially presented, was a long lean figure, wearing
such a faded air that she seemed not to have been made in what linen-drapers
call `fast colours' originally, and to have, by little and little, washed
out. But for this she might have been described as the very pink of general
propitiation and politeness. From a long habit of listening admirably to
everything that was said in her presence, and looking at the speakers as
if she were mentally engaged in taking off impressions of their images
upon her soul, never to part with the same but with life, her head had
quite settled on one side. Her hands had contracted a spasmodic habit of
raising themselves of their own accord as in involuntary admiration. Her
eyes were liable to a similar affection. She had the softest voice that
ever was heard; and her nose, stupendously aquiline, had a little knob
in the very centre or key-stone of the bridge, whence it tended downwards
towards her face, as in an invincible determination never to turn up at
anything.

<P>&nbsp;Miss Tox's dress, though perfectly genteel and good, had a certain
character of angularity and scantiness. She was accustomed to wear odd
weedy little flowers in her bonnets and caps. Strange grasses were sometimes
perceived in her hair; and it was observed by the curious, of all her collars,
frills, tuckers, wristbands, and other gossamer articles--indeed of everything
she wore which had two ends to it intended to unite--that the two ends
were never on good terms, and wouldn't quite meet without a struggle. She
had furry articles for winter wear, as tippets, boas, and muffs, which
stood up on end in a rampant manner, and were not at all sleek. She was
much given to the carrying about of small bags with snaps to them, that
went off like little pistols when they were shut up; and when full-dressed,
she wore round her neck the barrenest of lockets, representing a fishy
old eye, with no approach to speculation in it. These and other appearances
of a similar nature, had served to propagate the opinion, that Miss Tox
was a lady of what is called a limited independence, which she turned to
the best account. Possibly her mincing gait encouraged the belief, and
suggested that her clipping a step of ordinary compass into two or three,
originated in her habit of making the most of everything.

<P>&nbsp;`I am sure,' said Miss Tox, with a prodigious curtsey, `that to
have the honour of being presented to Mr. Dombey is a distinction which
I have long sought, but very little expected at the present moment. My
dear Mrs. Chick--may I say Louisa!'

<P>&nbsp;Mrs. Chick took Miss Tox's hand in hers, rested the foot of her
wine-glass upon it, repressed a tear, and said in a low voice `Bless you!'

<P>&nbsp;`My dear Louisa then,' said Miss Tox, `my sweet friend, how are
you now?'

<P>&nbsp;`Better,' Mrs. Chick returned. `Take some wine. You have been
almost as anxious as I have been, and must want it, I am sure.'

<P>&nbsp;Mr. Dombey of course officiated.

<P>&nbsp;`Miss Tox, Paul,' pursued Mrs. Chick, still retaining her hand,
`knowing how much I have been interested in the anticipation of the event
of to-day, has been working at a little gift for Fanny, which I promised
to present. It is only a pin-cushion for the toilette table, Paul, but
I do say, and will say, and must say, that Miss Tox has very prettily adapted
the sentiment to the occasion. I call `Welcome little Dombey' Poetry, myself!'

<P>&nbsp;`Is that the device?' inquired her brother.

<P>&nbsp;`That is the device,' returned Louisa.

<P>&nbsp;`But do me the justice to remember, my dear Louisa,' said Miss
Tox in a tone of low and earnest entreaty, `that nothing but the--I have
some difficulty in expressing myself--the dubiousness of the result would
have induced me to take so great a liberty: "Welcome, Master Dombey," would
have been much more congenial to my feelings, as I am sure you know. But
the uncertainty attendant on angelic strangers, will, I hope, excuse what
must otherwise appear an unwarrantable familiarity.' Miss Tox made a graceful
bend as she spoke, in favour of Mr. Dombey, which that gentleman graciously
acknowledged. Even the sort of recognition of Dombey and Son, conveyed
in the foregoing conversation, was so palatable to him, that his sister,
Mrs. Chick--though he affected to consider her a weak good-natured person--had
perhaps more influence over him than anybody else.

<P>&nbsp;`Well' said Mrs. Chick, with a sweet smile, `after this, I forgive
Fanny everything!'

<P>It was a declaration in a Christian spirit, and Mrs. Chick felt that
it did her good. Not that she had anything particular to forgive in her
sister-in-law, nor indeed anything at all, except her having married her
brother--in itself a species of audacity--and her having, in the course
of events, given birth to a girl instead of a boy: which, as Mrs. Chick
had frequently observed, was not quite what she had expected of her, and
was not a pleasant return for all the attention and distinction she had
met with.

<P>&nbsp;Mr. Dombey being hastily summoned out of the room at this moment,
the two ladies were left alone together. Miss Tox immediately became spasmodic.

<P>&nbsp;`I knew you would admire my brother. I told you so before-hand,
my dear,' said Louisa.

<P>&nbsp;Miss Tox's hands and eyes expressed how much.

<P>&nbsp;`And as to his property, my dear!'

<P>&nbsp;`Ah!' said Miss Tox, with deep feeling.

<P>&nbsp;`Im--mense!'

<P>&nbsp;`But his deportment, my dear Louisa!' said Miss Tox. `His presence!
His dignity! No portrait that I have ever seen of any one has been half
so replete with those qualities. Something so stately, you know: so uncompromising:
so very wide across the chest: so upright! A pecuniary Duke of York, my
love, and nothing short of it!' said Miss Tox. `That's what <I>I</I> should
designate him.'

<P>&nbsp;`Why, my dear Paul!' exclaimed his sister, as he returned, `you
look quite pale! There's nothing the matter?'

<P>&nbsp;`I am sorry to say, Louisa, that they tell me that Fanny--'

<P>&nbsp;`Now, my dear Paul,' returned his sister rising, `don't believe
it. If you have any reliance on my experience, Paul, you may rest assured
that there is nothing wanting but an effort on Fanny's part. And that effort,'
she continued, taking off her bonnet, and adjusting her cap and gloves,
in a business-like manner, `she must be encouraged, and really, if necessary,
urged to make. Now, my dear Paul, come up stairs with me.'

<P>&nbsp;Mr. Dombey, who, besides being generally influenced by his sister
for the reason already mentioned, had really faith in her as an experienced
and bustling matron, acquiesced: and followed her, at once, to the sick
chamber.

<P>&nbsp;The lady lay upon her bed as he had left her, clasping her little
daughter to her breast. The child clung close about her, with the same
intensity as before, and never raised her head, or moved her soft cheek
from her mother's face, or looked on those who stood around, or spoke,
or moved, or shed a tear.

<P>&nbsp;`Restless without the little girl,' the Doctor whispered Mr. Dombey.
`We found it best to have her in again.'

<P>&nbsp;There was such a solemn stillness round the bed; and the two medical
attendants seemed to look on the impassive form with so much compassion
and so little hope, that Mrs. Chick was for the moment diverted from her
purpose. But presently summoning courage, and what she called presence
of mind, she sat down by the bedside, and said in the low precise tone
of one who endeavours to awaken a sleeper:

<P>&nbsp;`Fanny! Fanny!'

<P>&nbsp;There was no sound in answer but the loud ticking of Mr. Dombey's
watch and Doctor Parker Peps's watch, which seemed in the silence to be
running a race.

<P>&nbsp;`Fanny, my dear,' said Mrs. Chick, with assumed lightness, `here's
Mr. Dombey come to see you. Won't you speak to him? They want to lay your
little boy--the baby, Fanny, you know; you have hardly seen him yet, I
think--in bed; but they can't till you rouse yourself a little. Don't you
think it's time you roused yourself a little? Eh?'

<P>&nbsp;She bent her ear to the bed, and listened: at the same time looking
round at the bystanders, and holding up her finger.

<P>&nbsp;`Eh?' she repeated, `what was it you said, Fanny? I didn't hear
you.'

<P>&nbsp;No word or sound in answer. Mr. Dombey's watch and Dr. Parker
Peps's watch seemed to be racing faster.

<P>&nbsp;`Now, really, Fanny my dear,' said the sister-in-law, altering
her position, and speaking less confidently, and more earnestly, in spite
of herself, `I shall have to be quite cross with you, if you don't rouse
yourself. It's necessary for you to make an effort, and perhaps a very
great and painful effort which you are not disposed to make; but this is
a world of effort you know, Fanny, and we must never yield, when so much
depends upon us. Come! Try! I must really scold you if you don't!'

<P>&nbsp;The race in the ensuing pause was fierce and furious. The watches
seemed to jostle, and to trip each other up.

<P>&nbsp;`Fanny!' said Louisa, glancing round, with a gathering alarm.
`Only look at me. Only open your eyes to show me that you hear and understand
me; will you? Good Heaven, gentlemen, what is to be done!'

<P>&nbsp;The two medical attendants exchanged a look across the bed; and
the Physician, stooping down, whispered in the child's ear. Not having
understood the purport of his whisper, the little creature turned her perfectly
colourless face, and deep dark eyes towards him; but without loosening
her hold in the least.

<P>&nbsp;The whisper was repeated.

<P>&nbsp;`Mama!' said the child.

<P>&nbsp;The little voice, familiar and dearly loved, awakened some show
of consciousness, even at that ebb. For a moment, the closed eye-lids trembled,
and the nostril quivered, and the faintest shadow of a smile was seen.

<P>&nbsp;`Mama!' cried the child sobbing aloud. `Oh dear Mama! oh dear
Mama!'

<P>&nbsp;The Doctor gently brushed the scattered ringlets of the child,
aside from the face and mouth of the mother. Alas how calm they lay there;
how little breath there was to stir them!

<P>&nbsp;Thus, clinging fast to that slight spar within her arms, the mother
drifted out upon the dark and unknown sea that rolls round all the world.
