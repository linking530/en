how Mr Kenwigs underwent violent agitation, and how Mrs Kenwigs was as

<P>I<FONT SIZE=-1>T MIGHT HAVE BEEN</FONT> seven o'clock in the evening,
and it was growing dark in the narrow streets near Golden Square, when
Mr Kenwigs sent out for a pair of the cheapest white kid gloves -- those
at fourteen-pence -- and selecting the strongest, which happened to be
the right-hand one, walked downstairs with an air of pomp and much excitement,
and proceeded to muffle the knob of the street-door knocker therein. Having
executed this task with great nicety, Mr Kenwigs pulled the door to, after
him, and just stepped across the road to try the effect from the opposite
side of the street. Satisfied that nothing could possibly look better in
its way, Mr Kenwigs then stepped back again, and calling through the keyhole
to Morleena to open the door, vanished into the house, and was seen no
longer.

<P>Now, considered as an abstract circumstance, there was no more obvious
cause or reason why Mr Kenwigs should take the trouble of muffling this
particular knocker, than there would have been for his muffling the knocker
of any nobleman or gentleman resident ten miles off; because, for the greater
convenience of the numerous lodgers, the street-door always stood wide
open, and the knocker was never used at all. The first floor, the second
floor, and the third floor, had each a bell of its own. As to the attics,
no one ever called on them; if anybody wanted the parlours, they were close
at hand, and all he had to do was to walk straight into them; while the
kitchen had a separate entrance down the area steps. As a question of mere
necessity and usefulness, therefore, this muffling of the knocker was thoroughly
incomprehensible.

<P>But knockers may be muffled for other purposes than those of mere utilitarianism,
as, in the present instance, was clearly shown. There are certain polite
forms and ceremonies which must be observed in civilised life, or mankind
relapse into their original barbarism. No genteel lady was ever yet confined
-- indeed, no genteel confinement can possibly take place -- without the
accompanying symbol of a muffled knocker. Mrs Kenwigs was a lady of some
pretensions to gentility; Mrs Kenwigs was confined. And, therefore, Mr
Kenwigs tied up the silent knocker on the premises in a white kid glove.

<P>`I'm not quite certain neither,' said Mr Kenwigs, arranging his shirt-collar,
and walking slowly upstairs, `whether, as it's a boy, I won't have it in
the papers.'

<P>Pondering upon the advisability of this step, and the sensation it was
likely to create in the neighbourhood, Mr Kenwigs betook himself to the
sitting-room, where various extremely diminutive articles of clothing were
airing on a horse before the fire, and Mr Lumbey, the doctor, was dandling
the baby -- that is, the old baby -- not the new one.

<P>`It's a fine boy, Mr Kenwigs,' said Mr Lumbey, the doctor.

<P>`You consider him a fine boy, do you, sir?' returned Mr Kenwigs.

<P>`It's the finest boy I ever saw in all my life,' said the doctor. `I
never saw such a baby.'

<P>It is a pleasant thing to reflect upon, and furnishes a complete answer
to those who contend for the gradual degeneration of the human species,
that every baby born into the world is a finer one than the last.

<P>`I ne -- ver saw such a baby,' said Mr Lumbey, the doctor.

<P>`Morleena was a fine baby,' remarked Mr Kenwigs; as if this were rather
an attack, by implication, upon the family.

<P>`They were all fine babies,' said Mr Lumbey. And Mr Lumbey went on nursing
the baby with a thoughtful look. Whether he was considering under what
head he could best charge the nursing in the bill, was best known to himself.

<P>During this short conversation, Miss Morleena, as the eldest of the
family, and natural representative of her mother during her indisposition,
had been hustling and slapping the three younger Miss Kenwigses, without
intermission; which considerate and affectionate conduct brought tears
into the eyes of Mr Kenwigs, and caused him to declare that, in understanding
and behaviour, that child was a woman.

<P>`She will be a treasure to the man she marries, sir,' said Mr Kenwigs,
half aside; `I think she'll marry above her station, Mr Lumbey.'

<P>`I shouldn't wonder at all,' replied the doctor.

<P>`You never see her dance, sir, did you?' asked Mr Kenwigs.

<P>The doctor shook his head.

<P>`Ay!' said Mr Kenwigs, as though he pitied him from his heart, `then
you don't know what she's capable of.'

<P>All this time there had been a great whisking in and out of the other
room; the door had been opened and shut very softly about twenty times
a minute (for it was necessary to keep Mrs Kenwigs quiet); and the baby
had been exhibited to a score or two of deputations from a select body
of female friends, who had assembled in the passage, and about the street-door,
to discuss the event in all its bearings. Indeed, the excitement extended
itself over the whole street, and groups of ladies might be seen standing
at the doors, -- some in the interesting condition in which Mrs Kenwigs
had last appeared in public, -- relating their experiences of similar occurrences.
Some few acquired great credit from having prophesied, the day before yesterday,
exactly when it would come to pass; others, again, related, how that they
guessed what it was, directly they saw Mr Kenwigs turn pale and run up
the street as hard as ever he could go. Some said one thing, and some another;
but all talked together, and all agreed upon two points: first, that it
was very meritorious and highly praiseworthy in Mrs Kenwigs to do as she
had done: and secondly, that there never was such a skilful and scientific
doctor as that Dr Lumbey.

<P>In the midst of this general hubbub, Dr Lumbey sat in the first-floor
front, as before related, nursing the deposed baby, and talking to Mr Kenwigs.
He was a stout bluff-looking gentleman, with no shirt-collar to speak of,
and a beard that had been growing since yesterday morning; for Dr Lumbey
was popular, and the neighbourhood was prolific; and there had been no
less than three other knockers muffled, one after the other within the
last forty-eight hours.

<P>`Well, Mr Kenwigs,' said Dr Lumbey, `this makes six. You'll have a fine
family in time, sir.'

<P>`I think six is almost enough, sir,' returned Mr Kenwigs.

<P>`Pooh! pooh!' said the doctor. `Nonsense! not half enough.'

<P>With this, the doctor laughed; but he didn't laugh half as much as a
married friend of Mrs Kenwigs's, who had just come in from the sick chamber
to report progress, and take a small sip of brandy-and-water: and who seemed
to consider it one of the best jokes ever launched upon society.

<P>`They're not altogether dependent upon good fortune, neither,' said
Mr Kenwigs, taking his second daughter on his knee; `they have expectations.'

<P>`Oh, indeed!' said Mr Lumbey, the doctor.

<P>`And very good ones too, I believe, haven't they?' asked the married
lady.

<P>`Why, ma'am,' said Mr Kenwigs, `it's not exactly for me to say what
they may be, or what they may not be. It's not for me to boast of any family
with which I have the honour to be connected; at the same time, Mrs Kenwigs's
is -- I should say,' said Mr Kenwigs, abruptly, and raising his voice as
he spoke, `that my children might come into a matter of a hundred pound
apiece, perhaps. Perhaps more, but certainly that.'

<P>`And a very pretty little fortune,' said the married lady.

<P>`There are some relations of Mrs Kenwigs's,' said Mr Kenwigs, taking
a pinch of snuff from the doctor's box, and then sneezing very hard, for
he wasn't used to it, `that might leave their hundred pound apiece to ten
people, and yet not go begging when they had done it.'

<P>`Ah! I know who you mean,' observed the married lady, nodding her head.

<P>`I made mention of no names, and I wish to make mention of no names,'
said Mr Kenwigs, with a portentous look. `Many of my friends have met a
relation of Mrs Kenwigs's in this very room, as would do honour to any
company; that's all.'

<P>`I've met him,' said the married lady, with a glance towards Dr Lumbey.

<P>`It's naterally very gratifying to my feelings as a father, to see such
a man as that, a kissing and taking notice of my children,' pursued Mr
Kenwigs. `It's naterally very gratifying to my feelings as a man, to know
that man. It will be naterally very gratifying to my feelings as a husband,
to make that man acquainted with this ewent.'

<P>Having delivered his sentiments in this form of words, Mr Kenwigs arranged
his second daughter's flaxen tail, and bade her be a good girl and mind
what her sister, Morleena, said.

<P>`That girl grows more like her mother every day,' said Mr Lumbey, suddenly
stricken with an enthusiastic admiration of Morleena.

<P>`There!' rejoined the married lady. `What I always say -- what I always
did say! She's the very picter of her.' Having thus directed the general
attention to the young lady in question, the married lady embraced the
opportunity of taking another sip of the brandy-and-water -- and a pretty
long sip too.

<P>`Yes! there is a likeness,' said Mr Kenwigs, after some reflection.
`But such a woman as Mrs Kenwigs was, afore she was married! Good gracious,
such a woman!'

<P>Mr Lumbey shook his head with great solemnity, as though to imply that
he supposed she must have been rather a dazzler.

<P>`Talk of fairies!' cried Mr Kenwigs `<I>I</I> never see anybody so light
to be alive -- never. Such manners too; so playful, and yet so sewerely
proper! As for her figure! It isn't generally known,' said Mr Kenwigs,
dropping his voice; `but her figure was such, at that time, that the sign
of the Britannia, over in the Holloway Road, was painted from it!'

<P>`But only see what it is now,' urged the married lady. `Does <I>she</I>
look like the mother of six?'

<P>`Quite ridiculous,' cried the doctor.

<P>`She looks a deal more like her own daughter,' said the married lady.

<P>`So she does,' assented Mr Lumbey. `A great deal more.'

<P>Mr Kenwigs was about to make some further observations, most probably
in confirmation of this opinion, when another married lady, who had looked
in to keep up Mrs Kenwigs's spirits, and help to clear off anything in
the eating and drinking way that might be going about, put in her head
to announce that she had just been down to answer the bell, and that there
was a gentleman at the door who wanted to see Mr Kenwigs `most particular.'

<P>Shadowy visions of his distinguished relation flitted through the brain
of Mr Kenwigs, as this message was delivered; and under their influence,
he dispatched Morleena to show the gentleman up straightway.

<P>`Why, I do declare,' said Mr Kenwigs, standing opposite the door so
as to get the earliest glimpse of the visitor, as he came upstairs, `it's
Mr Johnson! How do you find yourself, sir?'

<P>Nicholas shook hands, kissed his old pupils all round, intrusted a large
parcel of toys to the guardianship of Morleena, bowed to the doctor and
the married ladies, and inquired after Mrs Kenwigs in a tone of interest,
which went to the very heart and soul of the nurse, who had come in to
warm some mysterious compound, in a little saucepan over the fire.

<P>`I ought to make a hundred apologies to you for calling at such a season,'
said Nicholas, `but I was not aware of it until I had rung the bell, and
my time is so fully occupied now, that I feared it might be some days before
I could possibly come again.'

<P>`No time like the present, sir,' said Mr Kenwigs. `The sitiwation ofMrs
Kenwigs, sir, is no obstacle to a little conversation between you and me,
I hope?'

<P>`You are very good,' said Nicholas.

<P>At this juncture, proclamation was made by another married lady, that
the baby had begun to eat like anything; whereupon the two married ladies,
already mentioned, rushed tumultuously into the bedroom to behold him in
the act.

<P>`The fact is,' resumed Nicholas, `that before I left the country, where
I have been for some time past, I undertook to deliver a message to you.'

<P>`Ay, ay?' said Mr Kenwigs.

<P>`And I have been,' added Nicholas, `already in town for some days, without
having had an opportunity of doing so.'

<P>`It's no matter, sir,' said Mr Kenwigs. `I dare say it's none the worse
for keeping cold. Message from the country!' said Mr Kenwigs, ruminating;
`that's curious. I don't know anybody in the country.'

<P>`Miss Petowker,' suggested Nicholas.

<P>`Oh! from her, is it?' said Mr Kenwigs. `Oh dear, yes. Ah! Mrs Kenwigs
will be glad to hear from her. Henrietta Petowker, eh? How odd things come
about, now! That you should have met her in the country! Well!'

<P>Hearing this mention of their old friend's name, the four Miss Kenwigses
gathered round Nicholas, open eyed and mouthed, to hear more. Mr Kenwigs
looked a little curious too, but quite comfortable and unsuspecting.

<P>`The message relates to family matters,' said Nicholas, hesitating.

<P>`Oh, never mind,' said Kenwigs, glancing at Mr Lumbey, who, having rashly
taken charge of little Lillyvick, found nobody disposed to relieve him
of his precious burden. `All friends here.'

<P>Nicholas hemmed once or twice, and seemed to have some difficulty in
proceeding.

<P>`At Portsmouth, Henrietta Petowker is,' observed Mr Kenwigs.

<P>`Yes,' said Nicholas, `Mr Lillyvick is there.'

<P>Mr Kenwigs turned pale, but he recovered, and said, <I>that</I> was
an odd coincidence also.

<P>`The message is from him,' said Nicholas.

<P>Mr Kenwigs appeared to revive. He knew that his niece was in a delicate
state, and had, no doubt, sent word that they were to forward full particulars.
Yes. That was very kind of him -- so like him too!

<P>`He desired me to give his kindest love,' said Nicholas.

<P>`Very much obliged to him, I'm sure. Your great-uncle, Lillyvick, my
dears!' interposed Mr Kenwigs, condescendingly explaining it to the children.

<P>`His kindest love,' resumed Nicholas; `and to say that he had no time
to write, but that he was married to Miss Petowker.'

<P>Mr Kenwigs started from his seat with a petrified stare, caught his
second daughter by her flaxen tail, and covered his face with his pocket-handkerchief.
Morleena fell, all stiff and rigid, into the baby's chair, as she had seen
her mother fall when she fainted away, and the two remaining little Kenwigses
shrieked in affright.

<P>`My children, my defrauded, swindled infants!' cried Mr Kenwigs, pulling
so hard, in his vehemence, at the flaxen tail of his second daughter, that
he lifted her up on tiptoe, and kept her, for some seconds, in that attitude.
`Villain, ass, traitor!'

<P>`Drat the man!' cried the nurse, looking angrily around. `What does
he mean by making that noise here?'

<P>`Silence, woman!' said Mr Kenwigs, fiercely.

<P>`I won't be silent,' returned the nurse. `Be silent yourself, you wretch.
Have you no regard for your baby?'

<P>`No!' returned Mr Kenwigs.

<P>`More shame for you,' retorted the nurse. `Ugh! you unnatural monster.'

<P>`Let him die,' cried Mr Kenwigs, in the torrent of his wrath. `Let him
die! He has no expectations, no property to come into. We want no babies
here,' said Mr Kenwigs recklessly. `Take 'em away, take 'em away to the
Fondling!'

<P>With these awful remarks, Mr Kenwigs sat himself down in a chair, and
defied the nurse, who made the best of her way into the adjoining room,
and returned with a stream of matrons: declaring that Mr Kenwigs had spoken
blasphemy against his family, and must be raving mad.

<P>Appearances were certainly not in Mr Kenwigs's favour, for the exertion
of speaking with so much vehemence, and yet in such a tone as should prevent
his lamentations reaching the ears of Mrs Kenwigs, had made him very black
in the face; besides which, the excitement of the occasion, and an unwonted
indulgence in various strong cordials to celebrate it, had swollen and
dilated his features to a most unusual extent. But, Nicholas and the doctor
-- who had been passive at first, doubting very much whether Mr Kenwigs
could be in earnest -- interfering to explain the immediate cause of his
condition, the indignation of the matrons was changed to pity, and they
implored him, with much feeling, to go quietly to bed.

<P>`The attention,' said Mr Kenwigs, looking around with a plaintive air,
`the attention that I've shown to that man! The hyseters he has eat, and
the pints of ale he has drank, in this house --!'

<P>`It's very trying, and very hard to bear, we know,' said one of the
married ladies; `but think of your dear darling wife.'

<P>`Oh yes, and what she's been a undergoing of, only this-is day,' cried
a great many voices. `There's a good man, do.'

<P>`The presents that have been made to him,' said Mr Kenwigs, reverting
to his calamity, `the pipes, the snuff-boxes -- a pair of india-rubber
goloshes, that cost six-and-six--'

<P>`Ah! it won't bear thinking of, indeed,' cried the matrons generally;
`but it'll all come home to him, never fear.'

<P>Mr Kenwigs looked darkly upon the ladies, as if he would prefer its
all coming home to <I>him</I>, as there was nothing to be got by it; but
he said nothing, and resting his head upon his hand, subsided into a kind
of doze.

<P>Then, the matrons again expatiated on the expediency of taking the good
gentleman to bed; observing that he would be better tomorrow, and that
they knew what was the wear and tear of some men's minds when their wives
were taken as Mrs Kenwigs had been that day, and that it did him great
credit, and there was nothing to be ashamed of in it; far from it; they
liked to see it, they did, for it showed a good heart. And one lady observed,
as a case bearing upon the present, that her husband was often quite light-headed
from anxiety on similar occasions, and that once, when her little Johnny
was born, it was nearly a week before he came to himself again, during
the whole of which time he did nothing but cry `Is it a boy, is it a boy?'
in a manner which went to the hearts of all his hearers.

<P>At length, Morleena (who quite forgot she had fainted, when she found
she was not noticed) announced that a chamber was ready for her afflicted
parent; and Mr Kenwigs, having partially smothered his four daughters in
the closeness of his embrace, accepted the doctor's arm on one side, and
the support of Nicholas on the other, and was conducted upstairs to a bedroom
which been secured for the occasion.

<P>Having seen him sound asleep, and heard him snore most satisfactorily,
and having further presided over the distribution of the toys, to the perfect
contentment of all the little Kenwigses, Nicholas took his leave. The matrons
dropped off one by one, with the exception of six or eight particular friends,
who had determined to stop all night; the lights in the houses gradually
disappeared; the last bulletin was issued that Mrs Kenwigs was as well
as could be expected; and the whole family were left to their repose.
