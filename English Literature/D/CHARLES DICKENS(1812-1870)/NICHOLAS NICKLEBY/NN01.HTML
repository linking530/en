<P>T<FONT SIZE=-1>HERE ONCE LIVED</FONT>, in a sequestered part of the
county of Devonshire, one Mr Godfrey Nickleby: a worthy gentleman, who,
taking it into his head rather late in life that he must get married, and
not being young enough or rich enough to aspire to the hand of a lady of
fortune, had wedded an old flame out of mere attachment, who in her turn
had taken him for the same reason. Thus two people who cannot afford to
play cards for money, sometimes sit down to a quiet game for love.

<P>Some ill-conditioned persons who sneer at the life-matrimonial, may
perhaps suggest, in this place, that the good couple would be better likened
to two principals in a sparring match, who, when fortune is low and backers
scarce, will chivalrously set to, for the mere pleasure of the buffeting;
and in one respect indeed this comparison would hold good: for, as the
adventurous pair of the Fives' Court will afterwards send round a hat,
and trust to the bounty of the lookers-on for the means of regaling themselves,
so Mr Godfrey Nickleby and <I>his</I> partner, the honeymoon being over,
looked out wistfully into the world, relying in no inconsiderable degree
upon chance for the improvement of their means. Mr Nickleby's income, at
the period of his marriage, fluctuated between sixty and eighty pounds
<I>per annum</I>.

<P>There are people enough in the world, Heaven knows! and even in London
(where Mr Nickleby dwelt in those days) but few complaints prevail, of
the population being scanty. It is extraordinary how long a man may look
among the crowd without discovering the face of a friend, but it is no
less true. Mr Nickleby looked, and looked, till his eyes became sore as
his heart, but no friend appeared; and when, growing tired of the search,
he turned his eyes homeward, he saw very little there to relieve his weary
vision. A painter who has gazed too long upon some glaring colour, refreshes
his dazzled sight by looking upon a darker and more sombre tint; but everything
that met Mr Nickleby's gaze wore so black and gloomy a hue, that he would
have been beyond description refreshed by the very reverse of the contrast.

<P>At length, after five years, when Mrs Nickleby had presented her husband
with a couple of sons, and that embarassed gentleman, impressed with the
necessity of making some provision for his family, was seriously revolving
in his mind a little commercial speculation of insuring his life next quarter-day,
and then falling from the top of the Monument by accident, there came,
one morning, by the general post, a black-bordered letter to inform him
how his uncle, Mr Ralph Nickleby, was dead, and had left him the bulk of
his little property, amounting in all to five thousand pounds sterling.

<P>As the deceased had taken no further notice of his nephew in his lifetime,
than sending to his eldest boy (who had been christened after him, on desperate
speculation) a silver spoon in a morocco case, which, as he had not too
much to eat with it, seemed a kind of satire upon his having been born
without that useful article of plate in his mouth, Mr Godfrey Nickleby
could, at first, scarcely believe the tidings thus conveyed to him. On
examination, however, they turned out to be strictly correct. The amiable
old gentleman, it seemed, had intended to leave the whole to the Royal
Humane Society, and had indeed executed a will to that effect; but the
Institution, having been unfortunate enough, a few months before, to save
the life of a poor relation to whom he paid a weekly allowance of three
shillings and sixpence, he had, in a fit of very natural exasperation,
revoked the bequest in a codicil, and left it all to Mr Godfrey Nickleby;
with a special mention of his indignation, not only against the society
for saving the poor relation's life, but against the poor relation also,
for allowing himself to be saved.

<P>With a portion of this property Mr Godfrey Nickleby purchased a small
farm, near Dawlish in Devonshire, whither he retired with his wife and
two children, to live upon the best interest he could get for the rest
of his money, and the little produce he could raise from his land. The
two prospered so well together that, when he died, some fifteen years after
this period, and some five after his wife, he was enabled to leave, to
his eldest son, Ralph, three thousand pounds in cash, and to his youngest
son, Nicholas, one thousand and the farm, which was as small a landed estate
as one would desire to see.

<P>These two brothers had been brought up together in a school at Exeter;
and, being accustomed to go home once a week, had often heard, from their
mother's lips, long accounts of their father's sufferings in his days of
poverty, and of their deceased uncle's importance in his days of affluence:
which recitals produced a very different impression on the two: for, while
the younger, who was of a timid and retiring disposition, gleaned from
thence nothing but forewarnings to shun the great world and attach himself
to the quiet routine of a country life, Ralph, the elder, deduced from
the often-repeated tale the two great morals that riches are the only true
source of happiness and power, and that it is lawful and just to compass
their acquisition by all means short of felony. `And,' reasoned Ralph with
himself, `if no good came of my uncle's money when he was alive, a great
deal of good came of it after he was dead, inasmuch as my father has got
it now, and is saving it up for me, which is a highly virtuous purpose;
and, going back to the old gentleman, good <I>did</I> come of it to him
too, for he had the pleasure of thinking of it all his life long, and of
being envied and courted by all his family besides.' And Ralph always wound
up these mental soliloquies by arriving at the conclusion, that there was
nothing like money.

<P>Not confining himself to theory, or permitting his faculties to rust,
even at that early age, in mere abstract speculations, this promising lad
commenced usurer on a limited scale at school; putting out at good interest
a small capital of slate-pencil and marbles, and gradually extending his
operations until they aspired to the copper coinage of this realm, in which
he speculated to considerable advantage. Nor did he trouble his borrowers
with abstract calculations of figures, or references to ready-reckoners;
his simple rule of interest being all comprised in the one golden sentence,
`twopence for every halfpenny,' which greatly simplified the accounts,
and which, as a familiar precept, more easily acquired and retained in
the memory than any known rule of arithmetic, cannot be too strongly recommended
to the notice of capitalists, both large and small, and more especially
of money-brokers and bill-discounters. Indeed, to do these gentlemen justice,
many of them are to this day in the frequent habit of adopting it, with
eminent success.

<P>In like manner, did young Ralph Nickleby avoid all those minute and
intricate calculations of odd days, which nobody who has worked sums in
simple-interest can fail to have found most embarrassing, by establishing
the one general rule that all sums of principal and interest should be
paid on pocket-money day, that is to say, on Saturday: and that whether
a loan were contracted on the Monday, or on the Friday, the amount of interest
should be, in both cases, the same. Indeed he argued, and with great show
of reason, that it ought to be rather more for one day than for five, inasmuch
as the borrower might in the former case be very fairly presumed to be
in great extremity, otherwise he would not borrow at all with such odds
against him. This fact is interesting, as illustrating the secret connection
and sympathy which always exist between great minds. Though Master Ralph
Nickleby was not at that time aware of it, the class of gentlemen before
alluded to, proceed on just the same principle in all their transactions.

<P>From what we have said of this young gentleman, and the natural admiration
the reader will immediately conceive of his character, it may perhaps be
inferred that he is to be the hero of the work which we shall presently
begin. To set this point at rest, for once and for ever, we hasten to undeceive
them, and stride to its commencement.

<P>On the death of his father, Ralph Nickleby, who had been some time before
placed in a mercantile house in London, applied himself passionately to
his old pursuit of money-getting, in which he speedily became so buried
and absorbed, that he quite forgot his brother for many years; and if,
at times, a recollection of his old playfellow broke upon him through the
haze in which he lived--for gold conjures up a mist about a man, more destructive
of all his old senses and lulling to his feelings than the fumes of charcoal--it
brought along with it a companion thought, that if they were intimate he
would want to borrow money of him. So, Mr Ralph Nickleby shrugged his shoulders,
and said things were better as they were.

<P>As for Nicholas, he lived a single man on the patrimonial estate until
he grew tired of living alone, and then he took to wife the daughter of
a neighbouring gentleman with a dower of one thousand pounds. This good
lady bore him two children, a son and a daughter, and when the son was
about nineteen, and the daughter fourteen, as near as we can guess--impartial
records--of young ladies' ages being, before the passing of the new act,
nowhere preserved in the registries of this country--Mr Nickleby looked
about him for the means of repairing his capital, now sadly reduced by
this increase in his family, and the expenses of their education.

<P>`Speculate with it,' said Mrs Nickleby.

<P>`Spec--u--late, my dear?' said Mr Nickleby, as though in doubt.

<P>`Why not?' asked Mrs Nickleby.

<P>`Because, my dear, if we <I>should</I> lose it,' rejoined Mr Nickleby,
who was a slow and time-taking speaker, `if we <I>should</I> lose it, we
shall no longer be able to live, my dear.'

<P>`Fiddle,' said Mrs Nickleby.

<P>`I am not altogether sure of that, my dear,' said Mr Nickleby.

<P>`There's Nicholas,' pursued the lady, `quite a young man--it's time
he was in the way of doing something for himself; and Kate too, poor girl,
without a penny in the world. Think of your brother! Would he be what he
is, if he hadn't speculated?'

<P>`That's true,' replied Mr Nickleby. `Very good, my dear. Yes. I <I>will</I>
speculate, my dear.'

<P>Speculation is a round game; the players see little or nothing of their
cards at first starting; gains <I>may</I> be great--and so may losses.
The run of luck went against Mr Nickleby. A mania prevailed, a bubble burst,
four stock-brokers took villa residences at Florence, four hundred nobodies
were ruined, and among them Mr Nickleby.

<P>`The very house I live in,' sighed the poor gentleman, `may be taken
from me tomorrow. Not an article of my old furniture, but will be sold
to strangers!'

<P>The last reflection hurt him so much, that he took at once to his bed;
apparently resolved to keep that, at all events.

<P>`Cheer up, sir!' said the apothecary.

<P>`You mustn't let yourself be cast down, sir,' said the nurse.

<P>`Such things happen every day,' remarked the lawyer.

<P>`And it is very sinful to rebel against them,' whispered the clergyman.

<P>`And what no man with a family ought to do,' added the neighbours.

<P>Mr Nickleby shook his head, and motioning them all out of the room,
embraced his wife and children, and having pressed them by turns to his
languidly beating heart, sunk exhausted on his pillow. They were concerned
to find that his reason went astray after this; for he babbled, for a long
time, about the generosity and goodness of his brother, and the merry old
times when they were at school together. This fit of wandering past, he
solemnly commended them to One who never deserted the widow or her fatherless
children, and, smiling gently on them, turned upon his face, and observed,
that he thought he could fall asleep.
