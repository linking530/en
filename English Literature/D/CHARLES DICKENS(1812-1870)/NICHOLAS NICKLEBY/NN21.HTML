CHAPTER XXI</H1></CENTER>

<CENTER><I>Madam Mantalini finds herself in a situation of some difficulty,
and Miss Nickleby finds herself in no situation at all</I></CENTER>
T<FONT SIZE=-1>HE AGITATION</FONT> she had undergone, rendered Kate Nickleby
unable to resume her duties at the dressmaker's for three days, at the
expiration of which interval she betook herself at the accustomed hour,
and with languid steps, to the temple of fashion where Madame Mantalini
reigned paramount and supreme.

<P>The ill-will of Miss Knag had lost nothing of its virulence in the interval.
The young ladies still scrupulously shrunk from all companionship with
their denounced associate; and when that exemplary female arrived a few
minutes afterwards, she was at no pains to conceal the displeasure with
which she regarded Kate's return.

<P>`Upon my word!' said Miss Knag, as the satellites flocked round, to
relieve her of her bonnet and shawl; `I should have thought some people
would have had spirit enough to stop away altogether, when they know what
an incumbrance their presence is to right-minded persons. But it's a queer
world; oh! it's a queer world!'

<P>Miss Knag, having passed this comment on the world, in the tone in which
most people do pass comments on the world when they are out of temper,
that is to say, as if they by no means belonged to it, concluded by heaving
a sigh, wherewith she seemed meekly to compassionate the wickedness of
mankind.

<P>The attendants were not slow to echo the sigh, and Miss Knag was apparently
on the eve of favouring them with some further moral reflections, when
the voice of Madame Mantalini, conveyed through the speaking-tube, ordered
Miss Nickleby upstairs to assist in the arrangement of the show-room; a
distinction which caused Miss Knag to toss her head so much, and bite her
lips so hard, that her powers of conversation were, for the time, annihilated.

<P>`Well, Miss Nickleby, child,' said Madame Mantalini, when Kate presented
herself; `are you quite well again?'

<P>`A great deal better, thank you,' replied Kate.

<P>`I wish I could say the same,' remarked Madame Mantalini, seating herself
with an air of weariness.

<P>`Are you ill?' asked Kate. `I am very sorry for that.'

<P>`Not exactly ill, but worried, child--worried,' rejoined Madame.

<P>`I am still more sorry to hear that,' said Kate, gently. `Bodily illness
is more easy to bear than mental.'

<P>`Ah! and it's much easier to talk than to bear either,' said Madame,
rubbing her nose with much irritability of manner. `There, get to your
work, child, and put the things in order, do.'

<P>While Kate was wondering within herself what these symptoms of unusual
vexation portended, Mr Mantalini put the tips of his whiskers, and, by
degrees, his head, through the half-opened door, and cried in a soft voice--

<P>`Is my life and soul there?'

<P>`No,' replied his wife.

<P>`How can it say so, when it is blooming in the front room like a little
rose in a demnition flower-pot?' urged Mantalini. `May its poppet come
in and talk?'

<P>`Certainly not,' replied Madame: `you know I never allow you here. Go
along!'

<P>The poppet, however, encouraged perhaps by the relenting tone of this
reply, ventured to rebel, and, stealing into the room, made towards Madame
Mantalini on tiptoe, blowing her a kiss as he came along.

<P>`Why will it vex itself, and twist its little face into bewitching nutcrackers?'
said Mantalini, putting his left arm round the waist of his life and soul,
and drawing her towards him with his right.

<P>`Oh! I can't bear you,' replied his wife.

<P>`Not--eh, not bear <I>me</I>!` exclaimed Mantalini. `Fibs, fibs. It
couldn't be. There's not a woman alive, that could tell me such a thing
to my face--to my own face.' Mr Mantalini stroked his chin, as he said
this, and glanced complacently at an opposite mirror.

<P>`Such destructive extravagance,' reasoned his wife, in a low tone.

<P>`All in its joy at having gained such a lovely creature, such a little
Venus, such a demd, enchanting, bewitching, engrossing, captivating little
Venus,' said Mantalini.

<P>`See what a situation you have placed me in!' urged Madame.

<P>`No harm will come, no harm shall come, to its own darling,' rejoined
Mr Mantalini. `It is all over; there will be nothing the matter; money
shall be got in; and if it don't come in fast enough, old Nickleby shall
stump up again, or have his jugular separated if he dares to vex and hurt
the little--'

<P>`Hush!' interposed Madame. `Don't you see?'

<P>Mr Mantalini, who, in his eagerness to make up matters with his wife,
had overlooked, or feigned to overlook, Miss Nickleby hitherto, took the
hint, and laying his finger on his lip, sunk his voice still lower. There
was, then, a great deal of whispering, during which Madame Mantalini appeared
to make reference, more than once, to certain debts incurred by Mr Mantalini
previous to her coverture; and also to an unexpected outlay of money in
payment of the aforesaid debts; and furthermore, to certain agreeable weaknesses
on that gentleman's part, such as gaming, wasting, idling, and a tendency
to horse-flesh; each of which matters of accusation Mr Mantalini disposed
of, by one kiss or more, as its relative importance demanded. The upshot
of it all was, that Madame Mantalini was in raptures with him, and that
they went upstairs to breakfast.

<P>Kate busied herself in what she had to do, and was silently arranging
the various articles of decoration in the best taste she could display,
when she started to hear a strange man's voice in the room, and started
again, to observe, on looking round, that a white hat, and a red neckerchief,
and a broad round face, and a large head, and part of a green coat were
in the room too.

<P>`Don't alarm yourself, miss,' said the proprietor of these appearances.

<P>I say; this here's the mantie-making consarn, an't it?'

<P>`Yes,' rejoined Kate, greatly astonished. `What did you want?'

<P>The stranger answered not; but, first looking back, as though to beckon
to some unseen person outside, came, very deliberately, into the room,
and was closely followed by a little man in brown, very much the worse
for wear, who brought with him a mingled fumigation of stale tobacco and
fresh onions. The clothes of this gentleman were much bespeckled with flue;
and his shoes, stockings, and nether garments, from his heels to the waist
buttons of his coat inclusive, were profusely embroidered with splashes
of mud, caught a fortnight previously--before the setting-in of the fine
weather.

<P>Kate's very natural impression was, that these engaging individuals
had called with the view of possessing themselves, unlawfully, of any portable
articles that chanced to strike their fancy. She did not attempt to disguise
her apprehensions, and made a move towards the door.

<P>`Wait a minnit,' said the man in the green coat, closing it softly,
and standing with his back against it. `This is a unpleasant bisness. Vere's
your govvernor?'

<P>`My what--did you say?' asked Kate, trembling; for she thought `governor'
might be slang for watch or money.

<P>`Mister Muntlehiney,' said the man. `Wot's come on him? Is he at home?'

<P>`He is abovestairs, I believe,' replied Kate, a little reassured by
this inquiry. `Do you want him?'

<P>`No,' replied the visitor. `I don't exactly want him, if it's made a
favour on. You can jist give him that 'ere card, and tell him if he wants
to speak to <I>me</I>, and save trouble, here I am; that's all.'

<P>With these words, the stranger put a thick square card into Kate's hand,
and, turning to his friend, remarked, with an easy air, `that the rooms
was a good high pitch;' to which the friend assented, adding, by way of
illustration, `that there was lots of room for a little boy to grow up
a man in either on 'em, without much fear of his ever bringing his head
into contract with the ceiling.'

<P>After ringing the bell which would summon Madame Mantalini, Kate glanced
at the card, and saw that it displayed the name of `Scaley,' together with
some other information to which she had not had time to refer, when her
attention was attracted by Mr Scaley himself, who, walking up to one of
the cheval-glasses, gave it a hard poke in the centre with his stick, as
coolly as if it had been made of cast iron.

<P>`Good plate this here, Tix,' said Mr Scaley to his friend.

<P>`Ah!' rejoined Mr Tix, placing the marks of his four fingers, and a
duplicate impression of his thumb, on a piece of sky-blue silk; `and this
here article warn't made for nothing, mind you.'

<P>From the silk, Mr Tix transferred his admiration to some elegant articles
of wearing apparel, while Mr Scaley adjusted his neckcloth, at leisure,
before the glass, and afterwards, aided by its reflection, proceeded to
the minute consideration of a pimple on his chin; in which absorbing occupation
he was yet engaged, when Madame Mantalini, entering the room, uttered an
exclamation of surprise which roused him.

<P>`Oh! Is this the missis?' inquired Scaley.

<P>`It is Madame Mantalini,' said Kate.

<P>`Then,' said Mr Scaley, producing a small document from his pocket and
unfolding it very slowly, `this is a writ of execution, and if it's not
conwenient to settle we'll go over the house at wunst, please, and take
the inwentory.'

<P>Poor Madame Mantalini wrung her hands for grief, and rung the bell for
her husband; which done, she fell into a chair and a fainting fit, simultaneously.
The professional gentlemen, however, were not at all discomposed by this
event, for Mr Scaley, leaning upon a stand on which a handsome dress was
displayed (so that his shoulders appeared above it, in nearly the same
manner as the shoulders of the lady for whom it was designed would have
done if she had had it on), pushed his hat on one side and scratched his
head with perfect unconcern, while his friend Mr Tix, taking that opportunity
for a general survey of the apartment preparatory to entering on business,
stood with his inventory-book under his arm and his hat-in his hand, mentally
occupied in putting a price upon every object within his range of vision.

<P>Such was the posture of affairs when Mr Mantalini hurried in; and as
that distinguished specimen had had a pretty extensive intercourse with
Mr Scaley's fraternity in his bachelor days, and was, besides, very far
from being taken by surprise on the present agitating occasion, he merely
shrugged his shoulders, thrust his hands down to the bottom of his pockets,
elevated his eyebrows, whistled a bar or two, swore an oath or two, and,
sitting astride upon a chair, put the best face upon the matter with great
composure and decency.

<P>`What's the demd total?' was the first question he asked.

<P>`Fifteen hundred and twenty-seven pound, four and ninepence ha'penny,'
replied Mr Scaley, without moving a limb.

<P>`The halfpenny be demd,' said Mr Mantalini, impatiently.

<P>`By all means if you vish it,' retorted Mr Scaley; `and the ninepence.'

<P>`It don't matter to us if the fifteen hundred and twenty-seven pound
went along with it, that I know on,' observed Mr Tix.

<P>`Not a button,' said Scaley.

<P>`Well,' said the same gentleman, alter a pause, `wot's to be done--anything?
Is it only a small crack, or a out-and-out smash? A break-up of the constitootion
is it?--werry good. Then Mr Tom Tix, esk-vire, you must inform your angel
wife and lovely family as you won't sleep at home for three nights to come,
along of being in possession here. Wot's the good of the lady a fretting
herself?' continued Mr Scaley, as Madame Mantalini sobbed. `A good half
of wot's here isn't paid for, I des-say, and wot a consolation oughtn't
that to be to her feelings!'

<P>With these remarks, combing great pleasantry with sound moral encouragement
under difficulties, Mr Scaley proceeded to take the inventory, in which
delicate task he was materially assisted by the uncommon tact and experience
of Mr Tix, the broker.

<P>`My cup of happiness's sweetener,' said Mantalini, approaching his wife
with a penitent air; `will you listen to me for two minutes?'

<P>`Oh! don't speak to me,' replied his wife, sobbing. `You have ruined
me, and that's enough.'

<P>Mr Mantalini, who had doubtless well considered his part, no sooner
heard these words pronounced in a tone of grief and severity, than he recoiled
several paces, assumed an expression of consuming mental agony, rushed
headlong from the room, and was, soon afterwards, heard to slam the door
of an upstairs dressing-room with great violence.

<P>`Miss Nickleby,' cried Madame Mantalini, when this sound met her ear,
`make haste, for Heaven's sake, he will destroy himself! I spoke unkindly
to him, and he cannot bear it from me. Alfred, my darling Alfred.'

<P>With such exclamations, she hurried upstairs, followed by Kate who,
although she did not quite participate in the fond wife's apprehensions,
was a little flurried, nevertheless. The dressing-room door being hastily
flung open, Mr Mantalini was disclosed to view, with his shirt-collar symmetrically
thrown back: putting a fine edge to a breakfast knife by means of his razor
strop.

<P>`Ah!' cried Mr Mantalini, `interrupted!' and whisk went the breakfast
knife into Mr Mantalini's dressing-gown pocket, while Mr Mantalini's eyes
rolled wildly, and his hair floating in wild disorder, mingled with his
whiskers.

<P>`Alfred,' cried his wife, flinging her arms about him, `I didn't mean
to say it, I didn't mean to say it!'

<P>`Ruined!' cried Mr Mantalini. `Have I brought ruin upon the best and
purest creature that ever blessed a demnition vagabond! Demmit, let me
go.' At this crisis of his ravings Mr Mantalini made a pluck at the breakfast
knife, and being restrained by his wife's grasp, attempted to dash his
head against the wall--taking very good care to be at least six feet from
it.

<P>`Compose yourself, my own angel,' said Madame. `It was nobody's fault;
it was mine as much as yours, we shall do very well yet. Come, Alfred,
come.'

<P>Mr Mantalini did not think proper to come to, all at once; but, after
calling several times for poison, and requesting some lady or gentleman
to blow his brains out, gentler feelings came upon him, and he wept pathetically.
In this softened frame of mind he did not oppose the capture of the knife--which,
to tell the truth, he was rather glad to be rid of, as an inconvenient
and dangerous article for a skirt pocket--and finally he suffered himself
to be led away by his affectionate partner.

<P>After a delay of two or three hours, the young ladies were informed
that their services would be dispensed with until further notice, and at
the expiration of two days, the name of Mantalini appeared in the list
of bankrupts: Miss Nickleby received an intimation per post, on the same
morning, that the business would be, in future, carried on under the name
of Miss Knag, and that her assistance would no longer be required--a piece
of intelligence with which Mrs Nickleby was no sooner made acquainted,
than that good lady declared she had expected it all along and cited divers
unknown occasions on which she had prophesied to that precise effect.

<P>`And I say again,' remarked Mrs Nickleby (who, it is scarcely necessary
to observe, had never said so before), `I say again, that a milliner's
and dressmaker's is the very last description of business, Kate, that you
should have thought of attaching yourself to. I don't make it a reproach
to you, my love; but still I will say, that if you had consulted your own
mother--'

<P>`Well, well, mamma,' said Kate, mildly: `what would you recommend now?'

<P>`Recommend!' cried Mrs Nickleby, `isn't it obvious, my dear, that of
all occupations in this world for a young lady situated as you are, that
of companion to some amiable lady is the very thing for which your education,
and manners, and personal appearance, and everything else, exactly qualify
you? Did you never hear your poor dear papa speak of the young lady who
was the daughter of the old lady who boarded in the same house that he
boarded in once, when he was a bachelor--what was her name again? I know
it began with a B, and ended with g, but whether it was Waters or--no,
it couldn't have been that, either; but whatever her name was, don't you
know that that young lady went as companion to a married lady who died
soon afterwards, and that she married the husband, and had one of the finest
little boys that the medical man had ever seen--all within eighteen months?

<P>Kate knew, perfectly well, that this torrent of favourable recollection
was occasioned by some opening, real or imaginary, which her mother had
discovered, in the companionship walk of life. She therefore waited, very
patiently, until all reminiscences and anecdotes, bearing or not bearing
upon the subject, had been exhausted, and at last ventured to inquire what
discovery had been made. The truth then came out. Mrs Nickleby had, that
morning, had a yesterday's newspaper of the very first respectability from
the public-house where the porter came from; and in this yesterday's newspaper
was an advertisement, couched in the purest and most grammatical English,
announcing that a married lady was in want of a genteel young person as
companion, and that the married lady's name and address were to be known,
on application at a certain library at the West-end of the town, therein
mentioned.

<P>`And I say,' exclaimed Mrs Nickleby, laying the paper down in triumph,
`that if your uncle don't object, it's well worth the trial.'

<P>Kate was too sick at heart, after the rough jostling she had already
had with the world, and really cared too little at the moment what fate
was reserved for her, to make any objection. Mr Ralph Nickleby offered
none, but, on the contrary, highly approved of the suggestion; neither
did he express any great surprise at Madame Mantalini's sudden failure,
indeed it would have been strange if he had, inasmuch as it had been procured
and brought about chiefly by himself. So, the name and address were obtained
without loss of time, and Miss Nickleby and her mamma went off in quest
of Mrs Wititterly, of Cadogan Place, Sloane Street, that same forenoon.

<P>Cadogan Place is the one slight bond that joins two great extremes;
it is the connecting link between the aristocratic pavements of Belgrave
Square, and the barbarism of Chelsea. It is in Sloane Street, but not of
it. The people in Cadogan Place look down upon Sloane Street, and think
Brompton low. They affect fashion too, and wonder where the New Road is.
Not that they claim to be on precisely the same footing as the high folks
of Belgrave Square and Grosvenor Place, but that they stand, with reference
to them, rather in the light of those illegitimate children of the great
who are content to boast of their connections, although their connections
disavow them. Wearing as much as they can of the airs and semblances of
loftiest rank, the people of Cadogan Place have the realities of middle
station. It is the conductor which communicates to the inhabitants of regions
beyond its limit, the shock of pride of birth and rank, which it has not
within itself, but derives from a fountain-head beyond; or, like the ligament
which unites the Siamese twins, it contains something of the life and essence
of two distinct bodies, and yet belongs to neither.

<P>Upon this doubtful ground, lived Mrs Wititterly, and at Mrs Wititterly's
door Kate Nickleby knocked with trembling hand. The door was opened by
a big footman with his head floured, or chalked, or painted in some way
(it didn't look genuine powder), and the big footman, receiving the card
of introduction, gave it to a little page; so little, indeed, that his
body would not hold, in ordinary array, the number of small buttons which
are indispensable to a page's costume, and they were consequently obliged
to be stuck on four abreast. This young gentleman took the card upstairs
on a salver, and pending his return, Kate and her mother were shown into
a dining-room of rather dirty and shabby aspect, and so comfortably arranged
as to be adapted to almost any purpose rather than eating and drinking.

<P>Now, in the ordinary course of things, and according to all authentic
descriptions of high life, as set forth in books, Mrs Wititterly ought
to have been in her <I>boudoir</I>; but whether it was that Mr Wititterly
was at that moment shaving himself in the <I>boudoir</I> or what not, certain
it is that Mrs Wititterly gave audience in the drawing-room, where was
everything proper and necessary, including curtains and furniture coverings
of a roseate hue, to shed a delicate bloom on Mrs Wititterly's complexion,
and a little dog to snap at strangers' legs for Mrs Wititterly's amusement,
and the afore-mentioned page, to hand chocolate for Mrs Wititterly's refreshment.

<P>The lady had an air of sweet insipidity, and a face of engaging paleness;
there was a faded look about her, and about the furniture, and about the
house. She was reclining on a sofa in such a very unstudied attitude, that
she might have been taken for an actress all ready for the first scene
in a ballet, and only waiting for the drop curtain to go up.

<P>`Place chairs.'

<P>The page placed them.

<P>`Leave the room, Alphonse.'

<P>The page left it; but if ever an Alphonse carried plain Bill in his
face and figure, that page was the boy.

<P>`I have ventured to call, ma'am,' said Kate, after a few seconds of
awkward silence, `from having seen your advertisement.'

<P>`Yes,' replied Mrs Wititterly, `one of my people put it in the paper--Yes.'

<P>`I thought, perhaps,' said Kate, modestly, `that if you had not already
made a final choice, you would forgive my troubling you with an application.'

<P>`Yes,' drawled Mrs Wititterly again.

<P>`If you have already made a selection--'

<P>`Oh dear no,' interrupted the lady, `I am not so easily suited. I really
don't know what to say. You have never been a companion before, have you?'

<P>Mrs Nickleby, who had been eagerly watching her opportunity, came dexterously
in, before Kate could reply. `Not to any stranger, ma'am,' said the good
lady; `but she has been a companion to me for some years. I am her mother,
ma'am.'

<P>`Oh!' said Mrs Wititterly, `I apprehend you.'

<P>`I assure you, ma'am,' said Mrs Nickleby, `that I very little thought,
at one time, that it would be necessary for my daughter to go out into
the world at all, for her poor dear papa was an independent gentleman,
and would have been at this moment if he had but listened in time to my
constant entreaties and--'

<P>`Dear mamma,' said Kate, in a low voice.

<P>`My dear Kate, if you will allow me to speak,' said Mrs Nickleby, `I
shall take the liberty of explaining to this lady--'

<P>`I think it is almost unnecessary, mamma.'

<P>And notwithstanding all the frowns and winks with which Mrs Nickleby
intimated that she was going to say something which would clench the business
at once, Kate maintained her point by an expressive look, and for once
Mrs Nickleby was stopped upon the very brink of an oration.

<P>`What are your accomplishments?' asked Mrs Wititterly, with her eyes
shut.

<P>Kate blushed as she mentioned her principal acquirements, and Mrs Nickleby
checked them all off, one by one, on her fingers; having calculated the
number before she came out. Luckily the two calculations agreed, so Mrs
Nickleby had no excuse for talking.

<P>`You are a good temper?' asked Mrs Wititterly, opening her eyes for
an instant, and shutting them again.

<P>`I hope so,' rejoined Kate.

<P>`And have a highly respectable reference for everything, have you?'

<P>Kate replied that she had, and laid her uncle's card upon the table.

<P>`Have the goodness to draw your chair a little nearer, and let me look
at you,' said Mrs Wititterly; `I am so very nearsighted that I can't quite
discern your features.'

<P>Kate complied, though not without some embarrassment, with this request,
and Mrs Wititterly took a languid survey of her countenance, which lasted
some two or three minutes.

<P>`I like your appearance,' said that lady, ringing a little bell. `Alphonse,
request your master to come here.'

<P>The page disappeared on this errand, and after a short interval, during
which not a word was spoken on either side, opened the door for an important
gentleman of about eight-and-thirty, of rather plebeian countenance, and
with a very light head of hair, who leant over Mrs Wititterly for a little
time, and conversed with her in whispers.

<P>`Oh!' he said, turning round, `yes. This is a most important matter.
Mrs Wititterly is of a very excitable nature; very delicate, very fragile;
a hothouse plant, an exotic.'

<P>`Oh! Henry, my dear,' interposed Mrs Wititterly.

<P>`You are, my love, you know you are; one breath--' said Mr W., blowing
an imaginary feather away. `Pho! you're gone!'

<P>The lady sighed.

<P>`Your soul is too large for your body,' said Mr Wititterly. `Your intellect
wears you out; all the medical men say so; you know that there is not a
physician who is not proud of being called in to you. What is their unanimous
declaration? "My dear doctor," said I to Sir Tumley Snuffim, in this very
room, the very last time he came. "My dear doctor, what is my wife's complaint?
Tell me all. I can bear it. Is it nerves?" "My dear fellow," he said, "be
proud of that woman; make much of her; she is an ornament to the fashionable
world, and to you. Her complaint is soul. It swells, expands, dilates--the
blood fires, the pulse quickens, the excitement increases--Whew!"' Here
Mr Wititterly, who, in the ardour of his description, had flourished his
right hand to within something less than an inch of Mrs Nickleby's bonnet,
drew it hastily back again, and blew his nose as fiercely as if it had
been done by some violent machinery.

<P>`You make me out worse than I am, Henry,' said Mrs Wititterly, with
a faint smile.

<P>`I do not, Julia, I do not,' said Mr W. `The society in which you move--necessarily
move, from your station, connection, and endowments--is one vortex and
whirlpool of the most frightful excitement. Bless my heart and body, can
I ever forget the night you danced with the baronet's nephew at the election
ball, at Exeter! It was tremendous.'

<P>`I always suffer for these triumphs afterwards,' said Mrs Wititterly.

<P>`And for that very reason,' rejoined her husband, `you must have a companion,
in whom there is great gentleness, great sweetness, excessive sympathy,
and perfect repose.'

<P>Here, both Mr and Mrs Wititterly, who had talked rather at the Nicklebys
than to each other, left off speaking, and looked at their two hearers,
with an expression of countenance which seemed to say, `What do you think
of all this?'

<P>`Mrs Wititterly,' said her husband, addressing himself to Mrs Nickleby,
`is sought after and courted by glittering crowds and brilliant circles.
She is excited by the opera, the drama, the fine arts, the--the--the--'

<P>`The nobility, my love,' interposed Mrs Wititterly.

<P>`The nobility, of course,' said Mr Wititterly. `And the military. She
forms and expresses an immense variety of opinions on an immense variety
of subjects. If some people in public life were acquainted with Mrs Wititterly's
real opinion of them, they would not hold their heads, perhaps, quite as
high as they do.'

<P>`Hush, Henry,' said the lady; `this is scarcely fair.'

<P>`I mention no names, Julia,' replied Mr Wititterly; `and nobody is injured.
I merely mention the circumstance to show that you are no ordinary person,
that there is a constant friction perpetually going on between your mind
and your body; and that you must be soothed and tended. Now let me hear,
dispassionately and calmly, what are this young lady's qualifications for
the office.'

<P>In obedience to this request, the qualifications were all gone through
again, with the addition of many interruptions and cross-questionings from
Mr Wititterly. It was finally arranged that inquiries should be made, and
a decisive answer addressed to Miss Nickleby under cover of her uncle,
within two days. These conditions agreed upon, the page showed them down
as far as the staircase window; and the big footman, relieving guard at
that point, piloted them in perfect safety to the street-door.

<P>`They are very distinguished people, evidently,' said Mrs Nickleby,
as she took her daughter's arm. `What a superior person Mrs Wititterly
is!'

<P>`Do you think so, mamma?' was all Kate's reply.

<P>`Why, who can help thinking so, Kate, my love?' rejoined her mother.
`She is pale though, and looks much exhausted. I hope she may not be wearing
herself out, but I am very much afraid.'

<P>These considerations led the deep-sighted lady into a calculation of
the probable duration of Mrs Wititterly's life, and the chances of the
disconsolate widower bestowing his hand on her daughter. Before reaching
home, she had freed Mrs Wititterly's soul from all bodily restraint; married
Kate with great splendour at St George's Hanover Square; and only left
undecided the minor question, whether a splendid French-polished mahogany
bedstead should be erected for herself in the two-pair back of the house
in Cadogan Place, or in the three-pair front: between which apartments
she could not quite balance the advantages, and therefore adjusted the
question at last, by determining to leave it to the decision of her son-in-law.

<P>The inquiries were made. The answer--not to Kate's very great joy--
was favourable; and at the expiration of a week she betook herself, with
all her movables and valuables, to Mrs Wititterly's mansion, where for
the present we will leave her.
