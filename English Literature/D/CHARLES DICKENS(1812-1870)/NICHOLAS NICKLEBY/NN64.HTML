CHAPTER LXIV</H1></CENTER>

<CENTER><I>An old acquaintance is recognised under melancholy circumstances,
and Dotheboys Hall breaks up for ever</I></CENTER>


<P>N<FONT SIZE=-1>ICHOLAS</FONT> was one of those whose joy is incomplete
unless it is shared by the friends of adverse and less fortunate days.
Surrounded by every fascination of love and hope, his warm heart yearned
towards plain John Browdie. He remembered their first meeting with a smile,
and their second with a tear; saw poor Smike once again with the bundle
on his shoulder trudging patiently by his side; and heard the honest Yorkshireman's
rough words of encouragement as he left them on their road to London.

<P>Madeline and he sat down, very many times, jointly to produce a letter
which should acquaint John at full length with his altered fortunes, and
assure him of his friendship and gratitude. It so happened, however, that
the letter could never be written. Although they applied themselves to
it with the best intentions in the world, it chanced that they always fell
to talking about something else, and when Nicholas tried it by himself,
he found it impossible to write one-half of what he wished to say, or to
pen anything, indeed, which on re-perusal did not appear cold and unsatisfactory
compared with what he had in his mind. At last, after going on thus from
day to day, and reproaching himself more and more, he resolved (the more
readily as Madeline strongly urged him) to make a hasty trip into Yorkshire,
and present himself before Mr and Mrs Browdie without a word of notice.

<P>Thus it was that between seven and eight o'clock one evening, he and
Kate found themselves in the Saracen's Head booking-office, securing a
place to Greta Bridge by the next morning's coach. They had to go westward,
to procure some little necessaries for his journey, and, as it was a fine
night, they agreed to walk there, and ride home.

<P>The place they had just been in called up so many recollections, and
Kate had so many anecdotes of Madeline, and Nicholas so many anecdotes
of Frank, and each was so interested in what the other said, and both were
so happy and confiding, and had so much to talk about, that it was not
until they had plunged for a full half-hour into that labyrinth of streets
which lies between Seven Dials and Soho, without emerging into any large
thoroughfare, that Nicholas began to think it just possible they might
have lost their way.

<P>The possibility was soon converted into a certainty; for, on looking
about, and walking first to one end of the street and then to the other,
he could find no landmark he could recognise, and was fain to turn back
again in quest of some place at which he could seek a direction.

<P>It was a by-street, and there was nobody about, or in the few wretched
shops they passed. Making towards a faint gleam of light which streamed
across the pavement from a cellar, Nicholas was about to descend two or
three steps so as to render himself visible to those below and make his
inquiry, when he was arrested by a loud noise of scolding in a woman's
voice.

<P>`Oh come away!' said Kate, `they are quarrelling. You'll be hurt.'

<P>`Wait one instant, Kate. Let us hear if there's anything the matter,'
returned her brother. `Hush!'

<P>`You nasty, idle, vicious, good-for-nothing brute,' cried the woman,
stamping on the ground, `why don't you turn the mangle?'

<P>`So I am, my life and soul!' replied the man's voice. `I am always turning.
I am perpetually turning, like a demd old horse in a demnition mill. My
life is one demd horrid grind!'

<P>`Then why don't you go and list for a soldier?' retorted the woman;
`you're welcome to.'

<P>`For a soldier!' cried the man. `For a soldier! Would his joy and gladness
see him in a coarse red coat with a little tail? Would she hear of his
being slapped and beat by drummers demnebly? Would she have him fire off
real guns, and have his hair cut, and his whiskers shaved, and his eyes
turned right and left, and his trousers pipeclayed?'

<P>`Dear Nicholas,' whispered Kate, `you don't know who that is. It's Mr
Mantalini I am confident.'

<P>`Do make sure! Peep at him while I ask the way,' said Nicholas. `Come
down a step or two -- come!'

<P>Drawing her after him, Nicholas crept down the steps and looked into
a small boarded cellar. There, amidst clothes-baskets and clothes, stripped
up to his shirt-sleeves, but wearing still an old patched pair of pantaloons
of superlative make, a once brilliant waistcoat, and moustache and whiskers
as of yore, but lacking their lustrous dye -- there, endeavouring to mollify
the wrath of a buxom female -- not the lawful Madame Mantalini, but the
proprietress of the concern -- and grinding meanwhile as if for very life
at the mangle, whose creaking noise, mingled with her shrill tones, appeared
almost to deafen him -- there was the graceful, elegant, fascinating, and
once dashing Mantalini.

<P>`Oh you false traitor!' cried the lady, threatening personal violence
on Mr Mantalini's face.

<P>`False! Oh dem! Now my soul, my gentle, captivating, bewitching, and
most demnebly enslaving chick-a-biddy, be calm,' said Mr Mantalini, humbly.

<P>`I won't!' screamed the woman. `I'll tear your eyes out!'

<P>`Oh! What a demd savage lamb!' cried Mr Mantalini.

<P>`You're never to be trusted,' screamed the woman; `you were out all
day yesterday, and gallivanting somewhere I know -- you know you were!
Isn't it enough that I paid two pound fourteen for you, and took you out
of prison and let you live here like a gentleman, but must you go on like
this: breaking, my heart besides?'

<P>`I will never break its heart, I will be a good boy, and never do so
any more; I will never be naughty again; I beg its little pardon,' said
Mr Mantalini, dropping the handle of the mangle, and folding his palms
together; `it is all up with its handsome friend! He has gone to the demnition
bow-wows. It will have pity? it will not scratch and claw, but pet and
comfort? Oh, demmit!'

<P>Very little affected, to judge from her action, by this tender appeal,
the lady was on the point of returning some angry reply, when Nicholas,
raising his voice, asked his way to Piccadilly.

<P>Mr Mantalini turned round, caught sight of Kate, and, without another
word, leapt at one bound into a bed which stood behind the door, and drew
the counterpane over his face: kicking meanwhile convulsively.

<P>`Demmit,' he cried, in a suffocating voice, `it's little Nickleby! Shut
the door, put out the candle, turn me up in the bedstead! Oh, dem, dem,
dem!'

<P>The woman looked, first at Nicholas, and then at Mr Mantalini, as if
uncertain on whom to visit this extraordinary behaviour; but Mr Mantalini
happening by ill-luck to thrust his nose from under the bedclothes, in
his anxiety to ascertain whether the visitors were gone, she suddenly,
and with a dexterity which could only have been acquired by long practice,
flung a pretty heavy clothes-basket at him, with so good an aim that he
kicked more violently than before, though without venturing to make any
effort to disengage his head, which was quite extinguished. Thinking this
a favourable opportunity for departing before any of the torrent of her
wrath discharged itself upon him, Nicholas hurried Kate off, and left the
unfortunate subject of this unexpected recognition to explain his conduct
as he best could.

<P>The next morning he began his journey. It was now cold, winter weather:
forcibly recalling to his mind under what circumstances he had first travelled
that road, and how many vicissitudes and changes he had since undergone.
He was alone inside the greater part of the way, and sometimes, when he
had fallen into a doze, and, rousing himself, looked out of the window,
and recognised some place which he well remembered as having passed, either
on his journey down, or in the long walk back with poor Smike, he could
hardly believe but that all which had since happened had been a dream,
and that they were still plodding wearily on towards London, with the world
before them.

<P>To render these recollections the more vivid, it came on to snow as
night set in; and, passing through Stamford and Grantham, and by the little
alehouse where he had heard the story of the bold Baron of Grogzwig, everything
looked as if he had seen it but yesterday, and not even a flake of the
white crust on the roofs had melted away. Encouraging the train of ideas
which flocked upon him, he could almost persuade himself that he sat again
outside the coach, with Squeers and the boys; that he heard their voices
in the air; and that he felt again, but with a mingled sensation of pain
and pleasure now, that old sinking of the heart, and longing after home.
While he was yet yielding himself up to these fancies he fell asleep, and,
dreaming of Madeline, forgot them.

<P>He slept at the inn at Greta Bridge on the night of his arrival, and,
rising at a very early hour next morning, walked to the market town, and
inquired for John Browdie's house. John lived in the outskirts, now he
was a family man; and as everbody knew him, Nicholas had no difficulty
in finding a boy who undertook to guide him to his residence.

<P>Dismissing his guide at the gate, and in his impatience not wen stopping
to admire the thriving look of cottage or garden either, Nicholas made
his way to the kitchen door, and knocked lustily with his stick.

<P>`Halloa!' cried a voice inside, `wa'et be the matther noo? Be the toon
afire? Ding, but thou mak'est noise eneaf!'

<P>With these words, John Browdie opened the door himself, and opening
his eyes too to their utmost width, cried, as he clapped his hands together,
and burst into a hearty roar:

<P>`Ecod, it be the godfeyther, it be the godfeyther! Tilly, here be Misther
Nickleby. Gi' us thee hond, mun. Coom awa', coom awa'. In wi 'un, doon
beside the fire; tak' a soop o' thot. Dinnot say a word till thou'st droonk
it a'! Oop wi' it, mun. Ding! but I'm reeght glod to see thee.'

<P>Adapting his action to his text, John dragged Nicholas into the kitchen,
forced him down upon a huge settle beside a blazing fire, poured out from
an enormous bottle about a quarter of a pint of spirits, thrust it into
his hand, opened his mouth and threw back his head as a sign to him to
drink it instantly, and stood with a broad grin of welcome overspreading
his great red face like a jolly giant.

<P>`I might ha' knowa'd,' said John,;' that nobody but thou would ha' coom
wi' sike a knock as you. Thot was the wa' thou knocked at schoolmeasther's
door, eh? Ha, ha, ha! But I say -- wa'at be a' this aboot schoolmeasther?'

<P>`You know it then?' said Nicholas.

<P>`They were talking aboot it, doon toon, last neeght,' replied John,
`but neane on 'em seemed quite to un'erstan' it, loike.'

<P>`After various shiftings and delays,' said Nicholas, `he has been sentenced
to be transported for seven years, for being in the unlawful possession
of a stolen will; and, after that, he has to suffer the consequence of
a conspiracy.'

<P>`Whew!' cried John, `a conspiracy! Soom'at in the pooder-plot wa' --
eh? Soom'at in the Guy Faurx line?'

<P>`No, no, no, a conspiracy connected with his school; I'll explain it
presently.'

<P>`Thot's reeght!' said John, `explain it arter breakfast, not noo, for
thou be'est hoongry, and so am I; and Tilly she mun' be at the bottom o'
a' explanations, for she says thot's the mutual confidence. Ha, ha, ha!
Ecod, it's a room start, is the mutual confidence!'

<P>The entrance of Mrs Browdie, with a smart cap on, and very many apologies
for their having been detected in the act of breakfasting in the kitchen,
stopped John in his discussion of this grave subject, and hastened the
breakfast: which, being composed of vast mounds of toast, new-laid eggs,
boiled ham, Yorkshire pie, and other cold substantials (of which heavy
relays were constantly appearing from another kitchen under the direction
of a very plump servant), was admirably adapted to the cold bleak morning,
and received the utmost justice from all parties. At last, it came to a
close; and the fire which had been lighted in the best parlour having by
this time burnt up, they adjourned thither, to hear what Nicholas had to
tell.

<P>Nicholas told them all, and never was there a story which awakened so
many emotions in the breasts of two eager listeners. At one time, honest
John groaned in sympathy, and at another roared with joy; at one time he
vowed to go up to London on purpose to get a sight of the brothers Cheeryble;
and, at another, swore that Tim Linkinwater should receive such a ham by
coach, and carriage free, as mortal knife had never carved. When Nicholas
began to describe Madeline, he sat with his mouth wide open, nudging Mrs
Browdie from time to time, and exclaiming under his breath that she must
be `raather a tidy sart,' and when he heard at last that his young friend
had come down purposely to communicate his good fortune, and to convey
to him all those assurances of friendship which he could not state with
sufficient warmth in writing -- that the only object of his journey was
to share his happiness with them, and to tell them that when he was married
they must come up to see him, and that Madeline insisted on it as well
as he -- John could hold out no longer, but after looking indignantly at
his wife, and demanding to know what she was whimpering for, drew his coat
sleeve over his eyes and blubbered outright.

<P>`Tell'ee wa'at though,' said John seriously, when a great deal had been
said on both sides, `to return to schoolmeasther. If this news aboot 'un
has reached school today, the old 'ooman wean't have a whole boan in her
boddy, nor Fanny neither.'

<P>`Oh, John!' cried Mrs Browdie.

<P>`Ah! and Oh, John, agean,' replied the Yorkshireman. `I dinnot know
what they lads mightn't do. When it first got aboot that schoolmeasther
was in trouble, some feythers and moothers sent and took their young chaps
awa'. If them as is left should know wa'at's coom tiv'un, there'll be sike
a revolution and rebel! -- Ding! But I think they'll a' gang daft, and
spill bluid like wather!'

<P>In fact, John Browdie's apprehensions were so strong that he determined
to ride over to the school without delay, and invited Nicholas to accompany
him, which, however, he declined, pleading that his presence might perhaps
aggravate the bitterness of their adversity.

<P>`Thot's true!' said John; `I should ne'er ha' thought o' thot.'

<P>`I must return tomorrow,' said Nicholas, `but I mean to dine with you
today, and if Mrs Browdie can give me a bed--'

<P>`Bed!' cried John, `I wish thou couldst sleep in fower beds at once.
Ecod, thou shouldst have 'em a'. Bide till I coom back, on'y bide till
I coom back, and ecod we'll make a day of it.'

<P>Giving his wife a hearty kiss, and Nicholas a no less hearty shake of
the hand, John mounted his horse and rode off: leaving Mrs Browdie to apply
herself to hospitable preparations, and his young friend to stroll about
the neighbourhood, and revisit spots which were rendered familiar to him
by many a miserable association.

<P>John cantered away, and arriving at Dotheboys Hall, tied his horse to
a gate and made his way to the schoolroom door, which he found locked on
the inside. A tremendous noise and riot arose from within, and, applying
his eye to a convenient crevice in the wall, he did not remain long in
ignorance of its meaning.

<P>The news of Mr Squeers's downfall had reached Dotheboys; that was quite
clear. To all appearance, it had very recently become known to the young
gentlemen; for the rebellion had just broken out.

<P>It was one of the brimstone-and-treacle mornings, and Mrs Squeers had
entered school according to custom with the large bowl and spoon, followed
by Miss Squeers and the amiable Wackford: who, during his father's absence,
had taken upon him such minor branches of the executive as kicking the
pupils with his nailed boots, pulling the hair of some of the smaller boys,
pinching the others in aggravating places, and rendering himself, in various
similar ways, a great comfort and happiness to his mother. Their entrance,
whether by premeditation or a simultaneous impulse, was the signal of revolt.
While one detachment rushed to the door and locked it, and another mounted
on the desks and forms, the stoutest (and consequently the newest) boy
seized the cane, and confronting Mrs Squeers with a stern countenance,
snatched off her cap and beaver bonnet, put them on his own head, armed
himself with the wooden spoon, and bade her, on pain of death, go down
upon her knees and take a dose directly. Before that estimable lady could
recover herself, or offer the slightest retaliation, she was forced into
a kneeling posture by a crowd of shouting tormentors, and compelled to
swallow a spoonful of the odious mixture, rendered more than usually savoury
by the immersion in the bowl of Master Wackford's head, whose ducking was
intrusted to another rebel. The success of this first achievement prompted
the malicious crowd, whose faces were clustered together in every variety
of lank and half-starved ugliness, to further acts of outrage. The leader
was insisting upon Mrs Squeers repeating her dose, Master Squeers was undergoing
another dip in the treacle, and a violent assault had been commenced on
Miss Squeers, when John Browdie, bursting open the door with a vigorous
kick, rushed to the rescue. The shouts, screams, groans, hoots, and clapping
of hands, suddenly ceased, and a dead silence ensued.

<P>`Ye be noice chaps,' said John, looking steadily round. `What's to do
here, thou yoong dogs?'

<P>`Squeers is in prison, and we are going to run away!' cried a score
of shrill voices. `We won't stop, we won't stop!'

<P>`Weel, then, dinnot stop,' replied John; `who waants thee to stop? Roon
awa' loike men, but dinnot hurt the women.'

<P>`Hurrah!' cried the shrill voices, more shrilly still.

<P>`Hurrah?' repeated John. `Weel, hurrah loike men too. Noo then, look
out. Hip -- hip -- hip -- hurrah!'

<P>`Hurrah!' cried the voices.

<P>`Hurrah! Agean;' said John. `Looder still.'

<P>The boys obeyed.

<P>`Anoother!' said John. `Dinnot be afeared on it. Let's have a good 'un!'

<P>`Hurrah!'

<P>`Noo then,' said John, `let's have yan more to end wi', and then coot
off as quick as you loike. Tak'a good breath noo -- Squeers be in gaol
-- the school's brokken oop -- it's a' ower -- past and gane -- think o'
thot, and let it be a hearty 'un! Hurrah!'

<P>Such a cheer arose as the walls of Dotheboys Hall had never echoed before,
and were destined never to respond to again. When the sound had died away,
the school was empty; and of the busy noisy crowd which had peopled it
but five minutes before, not one remained.

<P>`Very well, Mr Browdie!' said Miss Squeers, hot and flushed from the
recent encounter, but vixenish to the last; `you've been and excited our
boys to run away. Now see if we don't pay you out for that, sir! If my
pa <I>is</I> unfortunate and trod down by henemies, we're not going to
be basely crowed and conquered over by you and 'Tilda.'

<P>`Noa!' replied John bluntly, `thou bean't. Tak' thy oath o' thot. Think
betther o' us, Fanny. I tell'ee both, that I'm glod the auld man has been
caught out at last -- dom'd glod -- but ye'll sooffer eneaf wi'out any
crowin' fra' me, and I be not the mun to crow, nor be Tilly the lass, so
I tell'ee flat. More than thot, I tell'ee noo, that if thou need'st friends
to help thee awa' from this place -- dinnot turn up thy nose, Fanny, thou
may'st -- thou'lt foind Tilly and I wi' a thout o' old times aboot us,
ready to lend thee a hond. And when I say thot, dinnot think I be asheamed
of wa'at I've deane, for I say again, Hurrah! and dom the schoolmeasther
-- there!'

<P>His parting words concluded, John Browdie strode heavily out, remounted
his nag, put him once more into a smart canter, and, carolling lustily
forth some fragments of an old song, to which the horse's hoofs rang a
merry accompaniment, sped back to his pretty wife and to Nicholas.

<P>For some days afterwards, the neighbouring country was overrun with
boys, who, the report went, had been secretly furnished by Mr and Mrs Browdie,
not only with a hearty meal of bread and meat, but with sundry shillings
and sixpences to help them on their way. To this rumour John always returned
a stout denial, which he accompanied, however, with a lurking grin, that
rendered the suspicious doubtful, and fully confirmed all previous believers.

<P>There were a few timid young children, who, miserable as they had been,
and many as were the tears they had shed in the wretched school, still
knew no other home, and had formed for it a sort of attachment, which made
them weep when the bolder spirits fled, and cling to it as a refuge. Of
these, some were found crying under hedges and in such places, frightened
at the solitude. One had a dead bird in a little cage; he had wandered
nearly twenty miles, and when his poor favourite died, lost courage, and
lay down beside him. Another was discovered in a yard hard by the school,
sleeping with a dog, who bit at those who came to remove him, and licked
the sleeping child's pale face.

<P>They were taken back, and some other stragglers were recovered, but
by degrees they were claimed, or lost again; and, in course of time, Dotheboys
Hall and its last breaking-up began to be forgotten by the neighbours,
or to be only spoken of as among the things that had been.
