<P>T<FONT SIZE=-1>HERE ARE NOT</FONT> many men who lie abed too late, or
oversleep themselves, on their wedding morning. A legend there is of somebody
remarkable for absence of mind, who opened his eyes upon the day which
was to give him a young wife, and forgetting all about the matter, rated
his servants for providing him with such fine clothes as had been prepared
for the festival. There is also a legend of a young gentleman, who, not
having before his eyes the fear of the canons of the church for such cases
made and provided, conceived a passion for his grandmother. Both cases
are of a singular and special kind and it is very doubtful whether either
can be considered as a precedent likely to be extensively followed by succeeding
generations.

<P>Arthur Gride had enrobed himself in his marriage garments of bottle-green,
a full hour before Mrs Sliderskew, shaking off her more heavy slumbers,
knocked at his chamber door; and he had hobbled downstairs in full array
and smacked his lips over a scanty taste of his favourite cordial, ere
that delicate piece of antiquity enlightened the kitchen with her presence.

<P>`Faugh!' said Peg, grubbing, in the discharge of her domestic functions,
among a scanty heap of ashes in the rusty grate. `Wedding indeed! A precious
wedding! He wants somebody better than his old Peg to take care of him,
does he? And what has he said to me, many and many a time, to keep me content
with short food, small wages, and little fire? "My will, Peg! my will!"
says he: "I'm a bachelor--no friends--no relations, Peg." Lies! And now
he's to bring home a new mistress, a baby-faced chit of a girl! If he wanted
a wife, the fool, why couldn't he have one suitable to his age, and that
knew his ways? She won't come in <I>my</I> way, he says. No, that she won't,
but you little think why, Arthur boy!'

<P>While Mrs Sliderskew, influenced possibly by some lingering feelings
of disappointment and personal slight, occasioned by her old master's preference
for another, was giving loose to these grumblings below-stairs, Arthur
Gride was cogitating in the parlour upon what had taken place last night.

<P>`I can't think how he can have picked up what he knows,' said Arthur,
`unless I have committed myself--let something drop at Bray's, for instance,
which has been overheard. Perhaps I may. I shouldn't be surprised if that
was it. Mr Nickleby was often angry at my talking to him before we got
outside the door. I mustn't tell him that part of the business, or he'll
put me out of sorts, and make me nervous for the day.'

<P>Ralph was universally looked up to, and recognised among his fellows
as a superior genius, but upon Arthur Gride his stern unyielding character
and consummate art had made so deep an impression, that he was actually
afraid of him. Cringing and cowardly to the core by nature, Arthur Gride
humbled himself in the dust before Ralph Nickleby, and, even when they
had not this stake in common, would have licked his shoes and crawled upon
the ground before him rather than venture to return him word for word,
or retort upon him in any other spirit than one of the most slavish and
abject sycophancy.

<P>To Ralph Nickleby's, Arthur Gride now betook himself according to appointment;
and to Ralph Nickleby he related how, last night, some young blustering
blade, whom he had never seen, forced his way into his house, and tried
to frighten him from the proposed nuptials:--told, in short, what Nicholas
had said and done, with the slight reservation upon which he had determined.

<P>`Well, and what then?' said Ralph.

<P>`Oh! nothing more,' rejoined Gride.

<P>`He tried to frighten you,' said Ralph, `and you <I>were</I> frightened
I suppose; is that it?'

<P>`I frightened him by crying thieves and murder,' replied Gride. `Once
I was in earnest, I tell you that, for I had more than half a mind to swear
he uttered threats, and demanded my life or my money.'

<P>`Oho!' said Ralph, eyeing him askew. `Jealous too!'

<P>`Dear now see that!' cried Arthur, rubbing his hands and affecting to
laugh.

<P>`Why do you make those grimaces, man?' said Ralph; `you <I>are</I> jealous--and
with good cause I think.'

<P>`No, no, no,--not with good cause, hey? You don't think with good cause,
do you?' cried Arthur, faltering. `Do you though--hey?'

<P>`Why, how stands the fact?' returned Ralph. `Here is an old man about
to be forced in marriage upon a girl; and to this old man there comes a
handsome young fellow--you said he was handsome, didn't you?'

<P>`No!' snarled Arthur Gride.

<P>`Oh!' rejoined Ralph, `I thought you did. Well! Handsome or not handsome,
to this old man there comes a young fellow who casts all manner of fierce
defiances in his teeth--gums I should rather say--and tells him in plain
terms that his mistress hates him. What does he do that for? Philanthropy's
sake?'

<P>`Not for love of the lady,' replied Gride, `for he said that no word
of love--his very words--had ever passed between 'em.'

<P>`He said!' repeated Ralph, contemptuously. `But I like him for one thing,
and that is, his giving you this fair warning to keep your--what is it?--Tit-tit
or dainty chick--which?--under lock and key. Be careful, Gride, be careful.
It's a triumph, too, to tear her away from a gallant young rival: a great
triumph for an old man! It only remains to keep her safe when you have
her--that's all.'

<P>`What a man it is!' cried Arthur Gride, affecting, in the extremity
of his torture, to be highly amused. And then he added, anxiously, `Yes;
to keep her safe, that's all. And that isn't much, is it?'

<P>`Much!' said Ralph, with a sneer. `Why, everybody knows what easy things
to understand and to control, women are. But come, it's very nearly time
for you to be made happy. You'll pay the bond now, I suppose, to save us
trouble afterwards.'

<P>`Oh what a man you are!' croaked Arthur.

<P>`Why not?' said Ralph. `Nobody will pay you interest for the money,
I suppose, between this and twelve o'clock, will they?'

<P>`But nobody would pay you interest for it either, you know,' returned
Arthur, leering at Ralph with all the cunning and slyness he could throw
into his face.

<P>`Besides which,' said Ralph, suffering his lip to curl into a smile,
`you haven't the money about you, and you weren't prepared for this, or
you'd have brought it with you; and there's nobody you'd so much like to
accommodate as me. I see. We trust each other in about an equal degree.
Are you ready?'

<P>Gride, who had done nothing but grin, and nod, and chatter, during this
last speech of Ralph's, answered in the affirmative; and, producing from
his hat a couple of large white favours, pinned one on his breast, and
with considerable difficulty induced his friend to do the like. Thus accoutred,
they got into a hired coach which Ralph had in waiting, and drove to the
residence of the fair and most wretched bride.

<P>Gride, whose spirits and courage had gradually failed him more and more
as they approached nearer and nearer to the house, was utterly dismayed
and cowed by the mournful silence which pervaded it. The face of the poor
servant girl, the only person they saw, was disfigured with tears and want
of sleep. There was nobody to receive or welcome them; and they stole upstairs
into the usual sitting-room, more like two burglars than the bridegroom
and his friend.

<P>`One would think,' said Ralph, speaking, in spite of himself, in a low
and subdued voice, `that there was a funeral going on here, and not a wedding.'

<P>`He, he!' tittered his friend, `you are so--so very funny!'

<P>`I need be,' remarked Ralph, drily, `for this is rather dull and chilling.
Look a little brisker, man, and not so hangdog like!'

<P>`Yes, yes, I will,' said Gride. `But--but--you don't think she's coming
just yet, do you?'

<P>`Why, I suppose she'll not come till she is obliged,' returned Ralph,
looking at his watch, `and she has a good half-hour to spare yet. Curb
your impatience.'

<P>`I--I--am not impatient,' stammered Arthur. `I wouldn't be hard with
her for the world. Oh dear, dear, not on any account. Let her take her
time--her own time. Her time shall be ours by all means.'

<P>While Ralph bent upon his trembling friend a keen look, which showed
that he perfectly understood the reason of this great consideration and
regard, a footstep was heard upon the stairs, and Bray himself came into
the room on tiptoe, and holding up his hand with a cautious gesture, as
if there were some sick person near, who must not be disturbed.

<P>`Hush!' he said, in a low voice. `She was very ill last night. I thought
she would have broken her heart. She is dressed, and crying bitterly in
her own room; but she's better, and quite quiet--that's everything!'

<P>`She is ready, is she?' said Ralph.

<P>`Quite ready,' returned the father.

<P>`And not likely to delay us by any young-lady weaknesses--fainting,
or so forth?' said Ralph.

<P>`She may be safely trusted now,' returned Bray. `I have been talking
to her this morning. Here--come a little this way.'

<P>He drew Ralph Nickleby to the further end of the room, and pointed towards
Gride, who sat huddled together in a corner, fumbling nervously with the
buttons of his coat, and exhibiting a face, of which every skulking and
base expression was sharpened and aggravated to the utmost by his anxiety
and trepidation.

<P>`Look at that man,' whispered Bray, emphatically. `This seems a cruel
thing, after all.'

<P>`What seems a cruel thing?' inquired Ralph, with as much stolidity of
face, as if he really were in utter ignorance of the other's meaning.

<P>`This marriage,' answered Bray. `Don't ask me what. You know as well
as I do.'

<P>Ralph shrugged his shoulders, in silent deprecation of Bray's impatience,
and elevated his eyebrows, and pursed his lips, as men do when they are
prepared with a sufficient answer to some remark, but wait for a more favourable
opportunity of advancing it, or think it scarcely worth while to answer
their adversary at all.

<P>`Look at him. Does it not seem cruel?' said Bray.

<P>`No!' replied Ralph, boldly.

<P>`I say it does,' retorted Bray, with a show of much irritation. `It
is a cruel thing, by all that's bad and treacherous!'

<P>When men are about to commit, or to sanction the commission of some
injustice, it is not uncommon for them to express pity for the object either
of that or some parallel proceeding, and to feel themselves, at the time,
quite virtuous and moral, and immensely superior to those who express no
pity at all. This is a kind of upholding of faith above works, and is very
comfortable. To do Ralph Nickleby justice, he seldom practised this sort
of dissimulation; but he understood those who did, and therefore suffered
Bray to say, again and again, with great vehemence, that they were jointly
doing a very cruel thing, before he again offered to interpose a word.

<P>`You see what a dry, shrivelled, withered old chip it is,' returned
Ralph, when the other was at length silent. `If he were younger, it might
be cruel, but as it is--harkee, Mr Bray, he'll die soon, and leave her
a rich young widow! Miss Madeline consults your tastes this time; let her
consult her own next.'

<P>`True, true,' said Bray, biting his nails, and plainly very ill at ease.
`I couldn't do anything better for her than advise her to accept these
proposals, could I? Now, I ask you, Nickleby, as a man of the world--could
I?'

<P>`Surely not,' answered Ralph. `I tell you what, sir;--there are a hundred
fathers, within a circuit of five miles from this place; well off; good,
rich, substantial men; who would gladly give their daughters, and their
own ears with them, to that very man yonder, ape and mummy as he looks.'

<P>`So there are!' exclaimed Bray, eagerly catching at anything which seemed
a justification of himself. `And so I told her, both last night and today.'

<P>`You told her truth,' said Ralph, `and did well to do so; though I must
say, at the same time, that if I had a daughter, and my freedom, pleasure,
nay, my very health and life, depended on her taking a husband whom I pointed
out, I should hope it would not be necessary to advance any other arguments
to induce her to consent to my wishes.'

<P>Bray looked at Ralph as if to see whether he spoke in earnest, and having
nodded twice or thrice in unqualified assent to what had fallen from him,
said:

<P>`I must go upstairs for a few minutes, to finish dressing. When I come
down, I'll bring Madeline with me. Do you know, I had a very strange dream
last night, which I have not remembered till this instant. I dreamt that
it was this morning, and you and I had been talking as we have been this
minute; that I went upstairs, for the very purpose for which I am going
now; and that as I stretched out my hand to take Madeline's, and lead her
down, the floor sunk with me, and after falling from such an indescribable
and tremendous height as the imagination scarcely conceives, except in
dreams, I alighted in a grave.'

<P>`And you awoke, and found you were lying on your back, or with your
head hanging over the bedside, or suffering some pain from indigestion?'
said Ralph. `Pshaw, Mr Bray, do as I do (you will have the opportunity,
now that a constant round of pleasure and enjoyment opens upon you), and,
occupying yourself a little more by day, have no time to think of what
you dream by night.'

<P>Ralph followed him, with a steady look, to the door; and, turning to
the bridegroom, when they were again alone, said,

<P>`Mark my words, Gride, you won't have to pay <I>his</I> annuity very
long. You have the devil's luck in bargains, always. If he is not booked
to make the long voyage before many months are past and gone, I wear an
orange for a head!'

<P>To this prophecy, so agreeable to his ears, Arthur returned no answer
than a cackle of great delight. Ralph, throwing himself into a chair, they
both sat waiting in profound silence. Ralph was thinking, with a sneer
upon his lips, on the altered manner of Bray that day, and how soon their
fellowship in a bad design had lowered his pride and established a familiarity
between them, when his attentive ear caught the rustling of a female dress
upon the stairs, and the footstep of a man.

<P>`Wake up,' he said, stamping his foot impatiently upon the ground, `and
be something like life, man, will you? They are here. Urge those dry old
bones of yours this way--quick, man, quick!'

<P>Gride shambled forward, and stood, leering and bowing, close by Ralph's
side, when the door opened and there entered in haste--not Bray and his
daughter, but Nicholas and his sister Kate.

<P>If some tremendous apparition from the world of shadows had suddenly
presented itself before him, Ralph Nickleby could not have been more thunder-stricken
than he was by this surprise. His hands fell powerless by his side, he
reeled back; and with open mouth, and a face of ashy paleness, stood gazing
at them in speechless rage: his eyes so prominent, and his face so convulsed
and changed by the passions which raged within him, that it would have
been difficult to recognise in him the same stern, composed, hard-featured
man he had been not a minute ago.

<P>`The man that came to me last night,' whispered Gride, plucking at his
elbow. `The man that came to me last night!'

<P>`I see,' muttered Ralph, `I know! I might have guessed as much before.
Across my every path, at every turn, go where I will, do what I may, he
comes!'

<P>The absence of all colour from the face; the dilated nostril; the quivering
of the lips which, though set firmly against each other, would not be still;
showed what emotions were struggling for the mastery with Nicholas. But
he kept them down, and gently pressing Kate's arm to reassure her, stood
erect and undaunted, front to front with his unworthy relative.

<P>As the brother and sister stood side by side, with a gallant bearing
which became them well, a close likeness between them was apparent, which
many, had they only seen them apart, might have failed to remark. The air,
carriage, and very look and expression of the brother were all reflected
in the sister, but softened and refined to the nicest limit of feminine
delicacy and attraction. More striking still was some indefinable resemblance,
in the face of Ralph, to both. While they had never looked more handsome,
nor he more ugly; while they had never held themselves more proudly, nor
he shrunk half so low; there never had been a time when this resemblance
was so perceptible, or when all the worst characteristics of a face rendered
coarse and harsh by evil thoughts were half so manifest as now.

<P>`Away!' was the first word he could utter as he literally gnashed his
teeth. `Away! What brings you here? Liar--scoundrel--dastard--thief!'

<P>`I come here,' said Nicholas in a low deep voice, `to save your victim
if I can. Liar and scoundrel you are, in every action of your life; theft
is your trade; and double dastard you must be, or you were not here today.
Hard words will not move me, nor would hard blows. Here I stand, and will,
till I have done my errand.'

<P>`Girl!' said Ralph, `retire! We can use force to him, but I would not
hurt you if I could help it. Retire, you weak and silly wench, and leave
this dog to be dealt with as he deserves.'

<P>`I will not retire,' cried Kate, with flashing eyes and the red blood
mantling in her cheeks. `You will do him no hurt that he will not repay.
You may use force with me; I think you will, for I <I>am</I> a girl, and
that would well become you. But if I have a girl's weakness, I have a woman's
heart, and it is not you who in a cause like this can turn that from its
purpose.'

<P>`And what may your purpose be, most lofty lady?' said Ralph.

<P>`To offer to the unhappy subject of your treachery, at this last moment,'
replied Nicholas, `a refuge and a home. If the near prospect of such a
husband as you have provided will not prevail upon her, I hope she may
be moved by the prayers and entreaties of one of her own sex. At all events
they shall be tried. I myself, avowing to her father from whom I come and
by whom I am commissioned, will render it an act of greater baseness, meanness,
and cruelty in him if he still dares to force this marriage on. Here I
wait to see him and his daughter. For this I came and brought my sister
even into your presence. Our purpose is not to see or speak with you; therefore
to you we stoop to say no more.'

<P>`Indeed!' said Ralph. `You persist in remaining here, ma'am, do you?'

<P>His niece's bosom heaved with the indignant excitement into which he
had lashed her, but she gave him no reply.

<P>`Now, Gride, see here,' said Ralph. `This fellow--I grieve to say my
brother's son: a reprobate and profligate, stained with every mean and
selfish crime--this fellow, coming here today to disturb a solemn ceremony,
and knowing that the consequence of his presenting himself in another man's
house at such a time, and persisting in remaining there, must be his being
kicked into the streets and dragged through them like the vagabond he is--this
fellow, mark you, brings with him his sister as a protection, thinking
we would not expose a silly girl to the degradation and indignity which
is no novelty to him; and, even after I have warned her of what must ensue,
he still keeps her by him, as you see, and clings to her apron-strings
like a cowardly boy to his mother's. Is not this a pretty fellow to talk
as big as you have heard him now?'

<P>`And as I heard him last night,' said Arthur Gride; `as I heard him
last night when he sneaked into my house, and--he! he! he!--very soon sneaked
out again, when I nearly frightened him to death. And <I>he</I> wanting
to marry Miss Madeline too! Oh dear! Is there anything else he'd like--anything
else we can do for him, besides giving her up? Would he like his debts
paid and his house furnished, and a few bank notes for shaving paper if
he shaves at all? He! he! he!'

<P>`You will remain, girl, will you?' said Ralph, turning upon Kate again,
`to be hauled downstairs like a drunken drab--as I swear you shall if you
stop here? No answer! Thank your brother for what follows. Gride, call
down Bray--and not his daughter. Let them keep her above.'

<P>`If you value your head,' said Nicholas, taking up a position before
the door, and speaking in the same low voice in which he had spoken before,
and with no more outward passion than he had before displayed; `stay where
you are!'

<P>`Mind me, and not him, and call down Bray,' said Ralph.

<P>`Mind yourself rather than either of us, and stay where you are!' said
Nicholas.

<P>`Will you call down Bray?' cried Ralph.

<P>`Remember that you come near me at your peril,' said Nicholas.

<P>Gride hesitated. Ralph being, by this time, as furious as a baffled
tiger, made for the door, and, attempting to pass Kate, clasped her arm
roughly with his hand. Nicholas, with his eyes darting fire, seized him
by the collar. At that moment, a heavy body fell with great violence on
the floor above, and, in an instant afterwards, was heard a most appalling
and terrific scream.

<P>They all stood still, and gazed upon each other. Scream succeeded scream;
a heavy pattering of feet succeeded; and many shrill voices clamouring
together were heard to cry, `He is dead!'

<P>`Stand off!' cried Nicholas, letting loose all the passion he had restrained
till now; `if this is what I scarcely dare to hope it is, you are caught,
villains, in your own toils.'

<P>He burst from the room, and, darting upstairs to the quarter from whence
the noise proceeded, forced his way through a crowd of persons who quite
filled a small bed-chamber, and found Bray lying on the floor quite dead;
his daughter clinging to the body.

<P>`How did this happen?' he cried, looking wildly about him.

<P>Several voices answered together, that he had been observed, through
the half-opened door, reclining in a strange and uneasy position upon a
chair; that he had been spoken to several times, and not answering, was
supposed to be asleep, until some person going in and shaking him by the
arm, he fell heavily to the ground and was discovered to be dead.

<P>`Who is the owner of this house?' said Nicholas, hastily.

<P>An elderly woman was pointed out to him; and to her he said, as he knelt
down and gently unwound Madeline's arms from the lifeless mass round which
they were entwined: `I represent this lady's nearest friends, as her servant
here knows, and must remove her from this dreadful scene. This is my sister
to whose charge you confide her. My name and address are upon that card,
and you shall receive from me all necessary directions for the arrangements
that must be made. Stand aside, every one of you, and give me room and
air for God's sake!'

<P>The people fell back, scarce wondering more at what had just occurred,
than at the excitement and impetuosity of him who spoke. Nicholas, taking
the insensible girl in his arms, bore her from the chamber and downstairs
into the room he had just quitted, followed by his sister and the faithful
servant, whom he charged to procure a coach directly, while he and Kate
bent over their beautiful charge and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore
her to animation. The girl performed her office with such expedition, that
in a very few minutes the coach was ready.

<P>Ralph Nickleby and Gride, stunned and paralysed by the awful event which
had so suddenly overthrown their schemes (it would not otherwise, perhaps,
have made much impression on them), and carried away by the extraordinary
energy and precipitation of Nicholas, which bore down all before him, looked
on at these proceedings like men in a dream or trance. It was not until
every preparation was made for Madeline's immediate removal that Ralph
broke silence by declaring she should not be taken away.

<P>`Who says so?' cried Nicholas, rising from his knee and confronting
them, but still retaining Madeline's lifeless hand in his.

<P>`I!' answered Ralph, hoarsely.

<P>`Hush, hush!' cried the terrified Gride, catching him by the arm again.
`Hear what he says.'

<P>`Ay!' said Nicholas, extending his disengaged hand in the air, `hear
what he says. That both your debts are paid in the one great debt of nature--that
the bond, due today at twelve, is now waste paper--that your contemplated
fraud shall be discovered yet--that your schemes are known to man, and
overthrown by Heaven--wretches, that he defies you both to do your worst.'

<P>`This man,' said Ralph, in a voice scarcely intelligible, `this man
claims his wife, and he shall have her.'

<P>`That man claims what is not his, and he should not have her if he were
fifty men, with fifty more to back him,' said Nicholas.

<P>`Who shall prevent him?'

<P>`I will.'

<P>`By what right I should like to know,' said Ralph. `By what right I
ask?'

<P>`By this right--that, knowing what I do, you dare not tempt me further,'
said Nicholas, `and by this better right--that those I serve, and with
whom you would have done me base wrong and injury, are her nearest and
her dearest friends. In their name I bear her hence. Give way!'

<P>`One word!' cried Ralph, foaming at the mouth.

<P>`Not one,' replied Nicholas, `I will not hear of one--save this. Look
to yourself, and heed this warning that I give you! Your day is past, and
night is comin' on--'

<P>`My curse, my bitter, deadly curse, upon you, boy!'

<P>`Whence will curses come at your command? or what avails a curse or
blessing from a man like you? I tell you, that misfortune and discovery
are thickening about your head; that the structures you have raised, through
all your ill-spent life, are crumbling into dust; that your path is beset
with spies; that this very day, ten thousand pounds of your hoarded wealth
have gone in one great crash!'

<P>`'Tis false!' cried Ralph, shrinking back.

<P>`'Tis true, and you shall find it so. I have no more words to waste.
Stand from the door. Kate, do you go first. Lay not a hand on her, or on
that woman, or on me, or so much a brush their garments as they pass you
by!--You let them pass, and he blocks the door again!'

<P>Arthur Gride happened to be in the doorway, but whether intentionally
or from confusion was not quite apparent. Nicholas swung him away, with
such violence as to cause him to spin round the room until he was caught
by a sharp angle of the wall, and there knocked down; and then taking his
beautiful burden in his arms rushed out. No one cared to stop him, if any
were so disposed. Making his way through a mob of people, whom a report
of the circumstances had attracted round the house, and carrying Madeline,
in his excitement, as easily as if she were an infant, he reached the coach
in which Kate and the girl were already waiting, and, confiding his charge
to them, jumped up beside the coachman and bade him drive away.
