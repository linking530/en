<P>Q<FONT SIZE=-1>UITE UNCONSCIOUS</FONT> of the demonstrations of their
amorous neighbour, or their effects upon the susceptible bosom of her mamma,
Kate Nickleby had, by this time, begun to enjoy a settled feeling of tranquillity
and happiness, to which, even in occasional and transitory glimpses, she
had long been a stranger. Living under the same roof with the beloved brother
from whom she had been so suddenly and hardly separated: with a mind at
ease, and free from any persecutions which could call a blush into her
cheek, or a pang into her heart: she seemed to have passed into a new state
of being. Her former cheerfulness was restored, her step regained its elasticity
and lightness, the colour which had forsaken her cheek visited it once
again, and Kate Nickleby looked more beautiful than ever.

<P>Such was the result to which Miss La Creevy's ruminations and observations
led her, when the cottage had been, as she emphatically said, `thoroughly
got to rights, from the chimney-pots to the street-door scraper,' and the
busy little woman had at length a moment's time to think about its inmates.

<P>`Which I declare I haven't had since I first came down here,' said Miss
La Creevy; `for I have thought of nothing but hammers, nails, screwdrivers,
and gimlets, morning, noon, and night.'

<P>`You never bestowed one thought upon yourself, I believe,' returned
Kate, smiling.

<P>`Upon my word, my dear, when there are so many pleasanter things to
think of, I should be a goose if I did,' said Miss La Creevy. `By-the-bye,
I <I>have</I> thought of somebody too. Do you know, that I observe a great
change in one of this family -- a very extraordinary change?'

<P>`In whom?' asked Kate, anxiously. `Not in --'

<P>`Not in your brother, my dear,' returned Miss La Creevy, anticipating
the close of the sentence, `for he is always the same affectionate good-natured
clever creature, with a spice of the -- I won't say who -- in him when
there's any occasion, that he was when I first knew you. No. Smike, as
he <I>will</I> be called, poor fellow! for he won't hear of a <I>Mr</I>
before his name, is greatly altered, even in this short time.'

<P>`How?' asked Kate. `Not in health?'

<P>`N--n--o; perhaps not in health exactly,' said Miss La Creevy, pausing
to consider, `although he is a worn and feeble creature, and has that in
his face which it would wring my heart to see in yours. No; not in health.'

<P>`How then?'

<P>`I scarcely know,' said the miniature painter. `But I have watched him,
and he has brought the tears into my eyes many times. It is not a very
difficult matter to do that, certainly, for I am easily melted; still I
think these came with good cause and reason. I am sure that since he has
been here, he has grown, from some strong cause, more conscious of his
weak intellect. He feels it more. It gives him greater pain to know that
he wanders sometimes, and cannot understand very simple things. I have
watched him when you have not been by, my dear, sit brooding by himself,
with such a look of pain as I could scarcely bear to see, and then get
up and leave the room: so sorrowfully, and in such dejection, that I cannot
tell you how it has hurt me. Not three weeks ago, he was a light-hearted
busy creature, overjoyed to be in a bustle, and as happy as the day was
long. Now, he is another being -- the same willing, harmless, faithful,
loving creature -- but the same in nothing else.'

<P>`Surely this will all pass off,' said Kate. `Poor fellow!'

<P>`I hope,' returned her little friend, with a gravity very unusual in
her, `it may. I hope, for the sake of that poor lad, it may. However,'
said Miss La Creevy, relapsing into the cheerful, chattering tone, which
was habitual to her, `I have said my say, and a very long say it is, and
a very wrong say too, I shouldn't wonder at all. I shall cheer him up tonight,
at all events, for if he is to be my squire all the way to the Strand,
I shall talk on, and on, and on, and never leave off, till I have roused
him into a laugh at something. So the sooner he goes, the better for him,
and the sooner I go, the better for me, I am sure, or else I shall have
my maid gallivanting with somebody who may rob the house -- though what
there is to take away, besides tables and chairs, I don't know, except
the miniatures: and he is a clever thief who can dispose of them to any
great advantage, for <I>I</I> can't, I know, and that's the honest truth.'

<P>So saying, little Miss La Creevy hid her face in a very flat bonnet,
and herself in a very big shawl; and fixing herself tightly into the latter,
by means of a large pin, declared that the omnibus might come as soon as
it pleased, for she was quite ready.

<P>But there was still Mrs Nickleby to take leave of; and long before that
good lady had concluded some reminiscences bearing upon, and appropriate
to, the occasion, the omnibus arrived. This put Miss La Creevy in a great
bustle, in consequence whereof, as she secretly rewarded the servant girl
with eighteen-pence behind the street-door, she pulled out of her reticule
ten-pennyworth of halfpence, which rolled into all possible corners of
the passage, and occupied some considerable time in the picking up. This
ceremony had, of course, to be succeeded by a second kissing of Kate and
Mrs Nickleby, and a gathering together of the little basket and the brown-paper
parcel, during which proceedings, `the omnibus,' as Miss La Creevy protested,
`swore so dreadfully, that it was quite awful to hear it.' At length and
at last, it made a feint of going-away, and then Miss La Creevy darted
out, and darted in, apologising with great volubility to all the passengers,
and declaring that she wouldn't purposely have kept them waiting on any
account whatever. While she was looking about for a convenient seat, the
conductor pushed Smike in, and cried that it was all right -- though it
wasn't -- and away went the huge vehicle, with the noise of half-a-dozen
brewers' drays at least.

<P>Leaving it to pursue its journey at the pleasure of the conductor afore-mentioned,
who lounged gracefully on his little shelf behind, smoking an odoriferous
cigar; and leaving it to stop, or go on, or gallop, or crawl, as that gentleman
deemed expedient and advisable; this narrative may embrace the opportunity
of ascertaining the condition of Sir Mulberry Hawk, and to what extent
he had, by this time, recovered from the injuries consequent on being flung
violently from his cabriolet, under the circumstances already detailed.

<P>With a shattered limb, a body severely bruised, a face disfigured by
half-healed scars, and pallid from the exhaustion of recent pain and fever,
Sir Mulberry Hawk lay stretched upon his back, on the couch to which he
was doomed to be a prisoner for some weeks yet to come. Mr Pyke and Mr
Pluck sat drinking hard in the next room, now and then varying the monotonous
murmurs of their conversation with a half-smothered laugh, while the young
lord -- the only member of the party who was not thoroughly irredeemable,
and who really had a kind heart -- sat beside his Mentor, with a cigar
in his mouth, and read to him, by the light of a lamp, such scraps of intelligence
from a paper of the day, as were most likely to yield him interest or amusement.

<P>`Curse those hounds!' said the invalid, turning his head impatiently
towards the adjoining room; `will nothing stop their infernal throats?'

<P>Messrs Pyke and Pluck heard the exclamation, and stopped immediately:
winking to each other as they did so, and filling their glasses to the
brim, as some recompense for the deprivation of speech.

<P>`Damn!' muttered the sick man between his teeth, and writhing impatiently
in his bed. `Isn't this mattress hard enough, and the room dull enough,
and pain bad enough, but <I>they</I> must torture me? What's the time?'

<P>`Half-past eight,' replied his friend.

<P>`Here, draw the table nearer, and let us have the cards again,' said
Sir Mulberry. `More piquet. Come.'

<P>It was curious to see how eagerly the sick man, debarred from any change
of position save the mere turning of his head from side to side, watched
every motion of his friend in the progress of the game; and with what eagerness
and interest he played, and yet how warily and coolly. His address and
skill were more than twenty times a match for his adversary, who could
make little head against them, even when fortune favoured him with good
cards, which was not often the case. Sir Mulberry won every game; and when
his companion threw down the cards, and refused to play any longer, thrust
forth his wasted arm and caught up the stakes with a boastful oath, and
the same hoarse laugh, though considerably lowered in tone, that had resounded
in Ralph Nickleby's dining-room, months before.

<P>While he was thus occupied, his man appeared, to announce that Mr Ralph
Nickleby was below, and wished to know how he was, tonight.

<P>`Better,' said Sir Mulberry, impatiently.

<P>`Mr Nickleby wishes to know, sir --'

<P>`I tell you, better,' replied Sir Mulberry, striking his hand upon the
table.

<P>The man hesitated for a moment or two, and then said that Mr Nickleby
had requested permission to see Sir Mulberry Hawk, if it was not inconvenient.

<P>`It <I>is</I> inconvenient. I can't see him. I can't see anybody,' said
his master, more violently than before. `You know that, you blockhead.'

<P>`I am very sorry, sir,' returned the man. `But Mr Nickleby pressed so
much, sir --'

<P>The fact was, that Ralph Nickleby had bribed the man, who, being anxious
to earn his money with a view to future favours, held the door in his hand,
and ventured to linger still.

<P>`Did he say whether he had any business to speak about?' inquired Sir
Mulberry, after a little impatient consideration.

<P>`No, sir. He said he wished to see you, sir. Particularly, Mr Nickleby
said, sir.'

<P>`Tell him to come up. Here,' cried Sir Mulberry, calling the man back,
as he passed his hand over his disfigured face, `move that lamp, and put
it on the stand behind me. Wheel that table away, and place a chair there
-- further off. Leave it so.'

<P>The man obeyed these directions as if he quite comprehended the motive
with which they were dictated, and left the room. Lord Frederick Verisopht,
remarking that he would look in presently, strolled into the adjoining
apartment, and closed the folding door behind him.

<P>Then was heard a subdued footstep on the stairs; and Ralph Nickleby,
hat in hand, crept softly into the room, with his body bent forward as
if in profound respect, and his eyes fixed upon the face of his worthy
client.

<P>`Well, Nickleby,' said Sir Mulberry, motioning him to the chair by the
couch side, and waving his hand in assumed carelessness, `I have had a
bad accident, you see.'

<P>`I see,' rejoined Ralph, with the same steady gaze. `Bad, indeed! I
should not have known you, Sir Mulberry. Dear, dear! This <I>is</I> bad.'

<P>Ralph's manner was one of profound humility and respect; and the low
tone of voice was that, which the gentlest consideration for a sick man
would have taught a visitor to assume. But the expression of his face,
Sir Mulberry's being averted, was in extraordinary contrast; and as he
stood, in his usual attitude, calmly looking on the prostrate form before
him, all that part of his features which was not cast into shadow by his
protruding and contracted brows, bore the impress of a sarcastic smile.

<P>`Sit down,' said Sir Mulberry, turning towards him, as though by a violent
effort. `Am I a sight, that you stand gazing there?'

<P>As he turned his face, Ralph recoiled a step or two, and making as though
he were irresistibly impelled to express astonishment, but was determined
not to do so, sat down with well-acted confusion.

<P>`I have inquired at the door, Sir Mulberry, every day,' said Ralph,
`twice a day, indeed, at first -- and tonight, presuming upon old acquaintance,
and past transactions by which we have mutually benefited in some degree,
I could not resist soliciting admission to your chamber. Have you -- have
you suffered much?' said Ralph, bending forward, and allowing the same
harsh smile to gather upon his face, as the other closed his eyes.

<P>`More than enough to please me, and less than enough to please some
broken-down hacks that you and I know of, and who lay their ruin between
us, I dare say,' returned Sir Mulberry, tossing his arm restlessly upon
the coverlet.

<P>Ralph shrugged his shoulders in deprecation of the intense irritation
with which this had been said; for there was an aggravating, cold distinctness
in his speech and manner which so grated on the sick man that he could
scarcely endure it.

<P>`And what is it in these "past transactions," that brought you here
tonight?' asked Sir Mulberry.

<P>`Nothing,' replied Ralph. `There are some bills of my lord's which need
renewal; but let them be till you are well. I -- I -- came,' said Ralph,
speaking more slowly, and with harsher emphasis, `I came to say how grieved
I am that any relative of mine, although disowned by me, should have inflicted
such punishment on you as --'

<P>`Punishment!' interposed Sir Mulberry.

<P>`I know it has been a severe one,' said Ralph, wilfully mistaking the
meaning of the interruption, `and that has made me the more anxious to
tell you that I disown this vagabond -- that I acknowledge him as no kin
of mine -- and that I leave him to take his deserts from you, and every
man besides. You may wring his neck if you please. <I>I</I> shall not interfere.'

<P>`This story that they tell me here, has got abroad then, has it?' asked
Sir Mulberry, clenching his hands and teeth.

<P>`Noised in all directions,' replied Ralph. `Every club and gaming-room
has rung with it. There has been a good song made about it, as I am told,'
said Ralph, looking eagerly at his questioner. `I have not heard it myself,
not being in the way of such things, but I have been told it's even printed
-- for private circulation -- but that's all over town, of course.'

<P>`It's a lie!' said Sir Mulberry; `I tell you it's all a lie. The mare
took fright.'

<P>`They <I>say</I> he frightened her,' observed Ralph, in the same unmoved
and quiet manner. `Some say he frightened you, but <I>that's</I> a lie,
I know. I have said that boldly -- oh, a score of times! I am a peaceable
man, but I can't hear folks tell that of you -- no, no.'

<P>When Sir Mulberry found coherent words to utter, Ralph bent forward
with his hand to his ear, and a face as calm as if its every line of sternness
had been cast in iron.

<P>`When I am off this cursed bed,' said the invalid, actually striking
at his broken leg in the ecstasy of his passion, `I'll have such revenge
as never man had yet. By God, I will. Accident favouring him, he has marked
me for a week or two, but I'll put a mark on him that he shall carry to
his grave. I'll slit his nose and ears -- flog him -- maim him for life.
I'll do more than that; I'll drag that pattern of chastity, that pink of
prudery, the delicate sister, through --'

<P>It might have been that even Ralph's cold blood tingled in his cheeks
at that moment. It might have been that Sir Mulberry remembered, that,
knave and usurer as he was, he must, in some early time of infancy, have
twined his arm about her father's neck. He stopped, and menacing with his
hand, confirmed the unuttered threat with a tremendous oath.

<P>`It is a galling thing,' said Ralph, after a short term of silence,
during which he had eyed the sufferer keenly, `to think that the man about
town, the rake, the <I>roue</I>, the rook of twenty seasons should be brought
to this pass by a mere boy!'

<P>Sir Mulberry darted a wrathful look at him, but Ralph's eyes were bent
upon the ground, and his face wore no other expression than one of thoughtfulness.

<P>`A raw, slight stripling,' continued Ralph, `against a man whose very
weight might crush him; to say nothing of his skill in -- I am right, I
think,' said Ralph, raising his eyes, `you <I>were</I> a parton of the
ring once, were you not?'

<P>The sick man made an impatient gesture, which Ralph chose to consider
as one of acquiescence.

<P>`Ha!' he said, `I thought so. That was before I knew you, but I was
pretty sure I couldn't be mistaken. He is light and active, I suppose.
But those were slight advantages compared with yours. Luck, luck -- these
hang-dog outcasts have it.'

<P>`He'll need the most he has, when I am well again,' said Sir Mulberry
Hawk, `let him fly where he will.'

<P>`Oh!' returned Ralph quickly, `he doesn't dream of that. He is here,
good sir, waiting your pleasure -- here in London, walking the streets
at noonday; carrying it off jauntily; looking for you, I swear,' said Ralph,
his face darkening, and his own hatred getting the upper hand of him, for
the first time, as this gay picture of Nicholas presented itself; `if we
were only citizens of a country where it could be safely done, I'd give
good money to have him stabbed to the heart and rolled into the kennel
for the dogs to tear.'

<P>As Ralph, somewhat to the surprise of his old client, vented this little
piece of sound family feeling, and took up his hat preparatory to departing,
Lord Frederick Verisopht looked in.

<P>`Why what in the deyvle's name, Hawk, have you and Nickleby been talking
about?' said the young man. `I neyver heard such an insufferable riot.
Croak, croak, croak. Bow, wow, wow. What has it all been about?'

<P>`Sir Mulberry has been angry, my Lord,' said Ralph, looking towards
the couch.

<P>`Not about money, I hope? Nothing has gone wrong in business, has it,
Nickleby?'

<P>`No, my Lord, no,' returned Ralph. `On that point we always agree. Sir
Mulberry has been calling to mind the cause of --'

<P>There was neither necessity nor opportunity for Ralph to proceed; for
Sir Mulberry took up the theme, and vented his threats and oaths against
Nicholas, almost as ferociously as before.

<P>Ralph, who was no common observer, was surprised to see that as this
tirade proceeded, the manner of Lord Frederick Verisopht, who at the commencement
had been twirling his whiskers with a most dandified and listless air,
underwent a complete alteration. He was still more surprised when, Sir
Mulberry ceasing to speak, the young lord angrily, and almost unaffectedly,
requested never to have the subject renewed in his presence.

<P>`Mind that, Hawk!' he added, with unusual energy. `I never will be a
party to, or permit, if I can help it, a cowardly attack upon this young
fellow.'

<P>`Cowardly!' interrupted his friend.

<P>`Ye-es,' said the other, turning full upon him. `If you had told him
who you were; if you had given him your card, and found out, afterwards,
that his station or character prevented your fighting him, it would have
been bad enough then; upon my soul it would have been bad enough then.
As it is, you did wrong. I did wrong too, not to interfere, and I am sorry
for it. What happened to you afterwards, was as much the consequence of
accident as design, and more your fault than his; and it shall not, with
my knowledge, be cruelly visited upon him -- it shall not indeed.'

<P>With this emphatic repetition of his concluding words, the young lord
turned upon his heel; but before he had reached the adjoining room he turned
back again, and said, with even greater vehemence than he had displayed
before.

<P>`I do believe, now; upon my honour I do believe, that the sister is
as virtuous and modest a young lady as she is a handsome one; and of the
brother, I say this, that he acted as her brother should, and in a manly
and spirited manner. And I only wish, with all my heart and soul, that
any one of us came out of this matter half as well as he does.'

<P>So saying, Lord Frederick Verisopht walked out of the room, leaving
Ralph Nickleby and Sir Mulberry in most unpleasant astonishment.

<P>`Is this your pupil?' asked Ralph, softly, `or has he come fresh from
some country parson?'

<P>`Green fools take these fits sometimes,' replied Sir Mulberry Hawk,
biting his lip, and pointing to the door. `Leave him to me.'

<P>Ralph exchanged a familiar look with his old acquaintance; for they
had suddenly grown confidential again in this alarming surprise; and took
his way home, thoughtfully and slowly.

<P>While these things were being said and done, and long before they were
concluded, the omnibus had disgorged Miss La Creevy and her escort, and
they had arrived at her own door. Now, the good-nature of the little miniature
painter would by no means allow of Smike's walking back again, until he
had been previously refreshed with just a sip of something comfortable
and a mixed biscuit or so; and Smike, entertaining no objection either
to the sip of something comfortable, or the mixed biscuit, but, considering
on the contrary that they would be a very pleasant preparation for a walk
to Bow, it fell out that he delayed much longer than he originally intended,
and that it was some half-hour after dusk when he set forth on his journey
home.

<P>There was no likelihood of his losing his way, for it lay quite straight
before him, and he had walked into town with Nicholas, and back alone,
almost every day. So, Miss La Creevy and he shook hands with mutual confidence,
and, being charged with more kind remembrances to Mrs and Miss Nickleby,
Smike started off.

<P>At the foot of Ludgate Hill, he turned a little out of the road to satisfy
his curiosity by having a look at Newgate. After staring up at the sombre
walls, from the opposite side of the way, with great care and dread for
some minutes, he turned back again into the old track, and walked briskly
through the City; stopping now and then to gaze in at the window of some
particularly attractive shop, then running for a little way, then stopping
again, and so on, as any other country lad might do.

<P>He had been gazing for a long time through a jeweller's window, wishing
he could take some of the beautiful trinkets home as a present, and imagining
what delight they would afford if he could, when the clocks struck three-quarters
past eight; roused by the sound, he hurried on at a very quick pace, and
was crossing the corner of a by-street when he felt himself violently brought
to, with a jerk so sudden that he was obliged to cling to a lamp-post to
save himself from falling. At the same moment, a small boy clung tight
round his leg, and a shrill cry of `Here he is, father! Hooray!' vibrated
in his ears.

<P>Smike knew that voice too well. He cast his despairing eyes downward
towards the form from which it had proceeded, and, shuddering from head
to foot, looked round. Mr Squeers had hooked him in the coat collar with
the handle of his umbrella, and was hanging on at the other end with all
his might and main. The cry of triumph proceeded from Master Wackford,
who, regardless of all his kicks and struggles, clung to him with the tenacity
of a bull-dog!

<P>One glance showed him this; and in that one glance the terrified creature
became utterly powerless and unable to utter a sound.

<P>`Here's a go!' cried Mr Squeers, gradually coming hand-over-hand down
the umbrella, and only unhooking it when he had got tight hold of the victim's
collar. `Here's a delicious go! Wackford, my boy, call up one of them coaches.'

<P>`A coach, father!' cried little Wackford.

<P>`Yes, a coach, sir,' replied Squeers, feasting his eyes upon the countenance
of Smike. `Damn the expense. Let's have him in a coach.'

<P>`What's he been a doing of?' asked a labourer with a hod of bricks,
against whom and a fellow-labourer Mr Squeers had backed, on the first
jerk of the umbrella.

<P>`Everything!' replied Mr Squeers, looking fixedly at his old pupil in
a sort of rapturous trance. `Everything -- running away, sir -- joining
in bloodthirsty attacks upon his master -- there's nothing that's bad that
he hasn't done. Oh, what a delicious go is this here, good Lord!'

<P>The man looked from Squeers to Smike; but such mental faculties as the
poor fellow possessed, had utterly deserted him. The coach came up; Master
Wackford entered; Squeers pushed in his prize, and following close at his
heels, pulled up the glasses. The coachman mounted his box and drove slowly
off, leaving the two bricklayers, and an old apple-woman, and a town-made
little boy returning from an evening school, who had been the only witnesses
of the scene, to meditate upon it at their leisure.

<P>Mr Squeers sat himself down on the opposite seat to the unfortunate
Smike, and, planting his hands firmly on his knees, looked at him for some
five minutes, when, seeming to recover from his trance, he uttered a loud
laugh, and slapped his old pupil's face several times -- taking the right
and left sides alternately.

<P>`It isn't a dream!' said Squeers. `That's real flesh and blood! I know
the feel of it!' and being quite assured of his good fortune by these experiments,
Mr Squeers administered a few boxes on the ear, lest the entertainments
should seem to partake of sameness, and laughed louder and longer at every
one.

<P>`Your mother will be fit to jump out of her skin, my boy, when she hears
of this,' said Squeers to his son.

<P>`Oh, won't she though, father?' replied Master Wackford.

<P>`To think,' said Squeers, `that you and me should be turning out of
a street, and come upon him at the very nick; and that I should have him
tight, at only one cast of the umbrella, as if I had hooked him with a
grappling-iron -- Ha, ha!'

<P>`Didn't I catch hold of his leg, neither, father?' said little Wackford.

<P>`You did; like a good 'un, my boy,' said Mr Squeers, patting his son's
head, `and you shall have the best button-over jacket and waistcoat that
the next new boy brings down, as a reward of merit -- mind that. You always
keep on in the same path, and do them things that you see your father do,
and when you die you'll go right slap to Heaven and no questions asked.'

<P>Improving the occasion in these words, Mr Squeers patted his son's head
again, and then patted Smike's -- but harder; and inquired in a bantering
tone how he found himself by this time.

<P>`I must go home,' replied Smike, looking wildly round.

<P>`To be sure you must. You're about right there,' replied Mr Squeers.
`You'll go home very soon, you will. You'll find yourself at the peaceful
village of Dotheboys, in Yorkshire, in something under a week's time, my
young friend; and the next time you get away from there, I give you leave
to keep away. Where's the clothes you run off in, you ungrateful robber?'
said Mr Squeers, in a severe voice.

<P>Smike glanced at the neat attire which the care of Nicholas had provided
for him; and wrung his hands.

<P>`Do you know that I could hang you up, outside of the Old Bailey, for
making away with them articles of property?' said Squeers. `Do you know
that it's a hanging matter -- and I an't quite certain whether it an't
an anatomy one besides -- to walk off with up'ards of the valley of five
pound from a dwelling-house? Eh -- do you know that? What do you suppose
was the worth of them clothes you had? Do you know that that Wellington
boot you wore, cost eight-and-twenty shillings when it was a pair, and
the shoe seven-and-six? But you came to the right shop for mercy when you
came to me, and thank your stars that it <I>is</I> me as has got to serve
you with the article.'

<P>Anybody not in Mr Squeers's confidence would have supposed that he was
quite out of the article in question, instead of having a large stock on
hand ready for all comers; nor would the opinion of sceptical persons have
undergone much alteration when he followed up the remark by poking Smike
in the chest with the ferrule of his umbrella, and dealing a smart shower
of blows, with the ribs of the same instrument, upon his head and shoulders.

<P>`I never threshed a boy in a hackney coach before,' said Mr Squeers,
when he stopped to rest. `There's inconveniency in it, but the novelty
gives it a sort of relish, too!'

<P>Poor Smike! He warded off the blows, as well as he could, and now shrunk
into a corner of the coach, with his held resting on his hands, and his
elbows on his knees; he was stunned and stupefied, and had no more idea
that any act of his, would enable him to escape from the allpowerful Squeers,
now that he had no friend to speak to or to advise with, than he had had
in all the weary years of his Yorkshire life which preceded the arrival
of Nicholas.

<P>The journey seemed endless; street after street was entered and left
behind; and still they went jolting on. At last Mr Squeers began to thrust
his head out of the widow every half-minute, and to bawl a variety of directions
to the coachman; and after passing, with some difficulty, through several
mean streets which the appearance of the houses and the bad state of the
road denoted to have been recently built, Mr Squeers suddenly tugged at
the check-string with all his might, and cried, `Stop!'

<P>`What are you pulling a man's arm off for?' said the coachman looking
angrily down.

<P>`That's the house,' replied Squeers. `The second of them four little
houses, one story high, with the green shutters -- there's brass plate
on the door, with the name of Snawley.'

<P>`Couldn't you say that without wrenching a man's limbs off his body?'
inquired the coachman.

<P>`No!' bawled Mr Squeers. `Say another word, and I'll summons you for
having a broken winder. Stop!'

<P>Obedient to this direction, the coach stopped at Mr Snawley's door.
Mr Snawley may be remembered as the sleek and sanctified gentleman who
confided two sons (<I>in law</I>) to the parental care of Mr Squeers, as
narrated in the fourth chapter of this history. Mr Snawley's house was
on the extreme borders of some new settlements adjoining Somers Town, and
Mr Squeers had taken lodgings therein for a short time, as his stay was
longer than usual, and the Saracen, having experience of Master Wackford's
appetite, had declined to receive him on any other terms than as a full-grown
customer.

<P>`Here we are!' said Squeers, hurrying Smike into the little parlour,
where Mr Snawley and his wife were taking a lobster supper. `Here's the
vagrant -- the felon -- the rebel -- the monster of unthankfulness.'

<P>`What! The boy that run away!' cried Snawley, resting his knife and
fork upright on the table, and opening his eyes to their full width.

<P>`The very boy', said Squeers, putting his fist close to Smike's nose,
and drawing it away again, and repenting the process several times, with
a vicious aspect. `If there wasn't a lady present, I'd fetch him such a
-- never mind, I'll owe it him.'

<P>And here Mr Squeers related how, and in what manner, and when and where,
he had picked up the runaway.

<P>`It's clear that there has been a Providence in it, sir,' said Mr Snawley,
casting down his eyes with an air of humility, and elevating his fork)
with a bit of lobster on the top of it, towards the ceiling.

<P>`Providence is against him, no doubt,' replied Mr Squeers, scratching
his nose. `Of course; that was to be expected. Anybody might have known
that.'

<P>`Hard-heartedness and evil-doing will never prosper, sir,' said Mr Snawley.

<P>`Never was such a thing known,' rejoined Squeers, taking a little roll
of notes from his pocket-book, to see that they were all safe.

<P>`I have been, Mr Snawley,' said Mr Squeers, when he had satisfied himself
upon this point, `I have been that chap's benefactor, feeder, teacher,
and clother. I have been that chap's classical, commercial, mathematical,
philosophical, and trigonomical friend. My son -- my only son, Wackford
-- has been his brother; Mrs Squeers has been his mother, grandmother,
aunt, -- ah! and I may say uncle too, all in one. She never cottoned to
anybody, except them two engaging and delightful boys of yours, as she
cottoned to this chap. What's my return? What's come of my milk of human
kindness? It turns into curds and whey when I look at him.'

<P>`Well it may, sir,' said Mrs Snawley. `Oh! Well it may, sir.'

<P>`Where has he been all this time?' inquired Snawley. `Has he been living
with --?'

<P>`Ah, sir!' interposed Squeers, confronting him again. `Have you been
a living with that there devilish Nickleby, sir?'

<P>But no threats or cuffs could elicit from Smike one word of reply to
this question; for he had internally resolved that he would rather perish
in the wretched prison to which he was again about to be consigned, than
utter one syllable which could involve his first and true friend. He had
already called to mind the strict injunctions of secrecy as to his past
life, which Nicholas had laid upon him when they travelled from Yorkshire;
and a confused and perplexed idea that his benefactor might have committed
some terrible crime in bringing him away, which would render him liable
to heavy punishment if detected, had contributed, in some degree, to reduce
him to his present state of apathy and terror.

<P>Such were the thoughts -- if to visions so imperfect and undefined as
those which wandered through his enfeebled brain, the term can be applied
-- which were present to the mind of Smike, and rendered him deaf alike
to intimidation and persuasion. Finding every effort useless, Mr Squeers
conducted him to a little back-room upstairs, where he was to pass the
night; and, taking the precaution of removing his shoes, and coat and waistcoat,
and also of locking the door on the outside, lest he should muster up sufficient
energy to make an attempt at escape, that worthy gentleman left him to
his meditations.

<P>What those meditations were, and how the poor creature's heart sunk
within him when he thought -- when did he, for a moment, cease to think?
-- of his late home, and the dear friends and familiar faces with which
it was associated, cannot be told. To prepare the mind for such a heavy
sleep, its growth must be stopped by rigour and cruelty in childhood; there
must be years of misery and suffering, lightened by no ray of hope; the
chords of the heart, which beat a quick response to the voice of gentleness
and affection, must have rusted and broken in their secret places, and
bear the lingering echo of no old word of love or kindness. Gloomy, indeed,
must have been the short day, and dull the long, long twilight, preceding
such a night of intellect as his.

<P>There were voices which would have roused him, even then; but their
welcome tones could not penetrate there; and he crept to bed the same listless,
hopeless, blighted creature, that Nicholas had first found him at the Yorkshire
school.
