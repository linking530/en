M<FONT SIZE=-1>ISS</FONT> N<FONT SIZE=-1>ICKLEBY'S REFLECTIONS</FONT>,
as she wended her way homewards, were of that desponding nature which the
occurrences of the morning had been sufficiently calculated to awaken.
Her uncle's was not a manner likely to dispel any doubts or apprehensions
she might have formed, in the outset, neither was the glimpse she had had
of Madame Mantalini's establishment by any means encouraging. It was with
many gloomy forebodings and misgivings, therefore, that she looked forward,
with a heavy heart, to the opening of her new career.

<P>If her mother's consolations could have restored her to a pleasanter
and more enviable state of mind, there were abundance of them to produce
the effect. By the time Kate reached home, the good lady had called to
mind two authentic cases of milliners who had been possessed of considerable
property, though whether they had acquired it all in business, or had had
a capital to start with, or had been lucky and married to advantage, she
could not exactly remember. However, as she very logically remarked, there
must have been some young person in that way of business who had made a
fortune without having anything to begin with, and that being taken for
granted, why should not Kate do the same? Miss La Creevy, who was a member
of the little council, ventured to insinuate some doubts relative to the
probability of Miss Nickleby's arriving at this happy consummation in the
compass of an ordinary lifetime; but the good lady set that question entirely
at rest, by informing them that she had a presentiment on the subject--a
species of second-sight with which she had been in the habit of clenching
every argument with the deceased Mr Nickleby, and, in nine cases and three-quarters
out of every ten, determining it the wrong way.

<P>`I am afraid it is an unhealthy occupation,' said Miss La Creevy. `I
recollect getting three young milliners to sit to me, when I first began
to paint, and I remember that they were all very pale and sickly.'

<P>`Oh! that's not a general rule by any means,' observed Mrs Nickleby;
`for I remember, as well as if it was only yesterday, employing one that
I was particularly recommended to, to make me a scarlet cloak at the time
when scarlet cloaks were fashionable, and she had a very red face--a very
red face, indeed.'

<P>`Perhaps she drank,' suggested Miss La Creevy.

<P>`I don't know how that may have been,' returned Mrs Nickleby: `but I
know she had a very red face, so your argument goes for nothing.'

<P>In this manner, and with like powerful reasoning, did the worthy matron
meet every little objection that presented itself to the new scheme of
the morning. Happy Mrs Nickleby! A project had but to be new, and it came
home to her mind, brightly varnished and gilded as a glittering toy.

<P>This question disposed of, Kate communicated her uncle's desire about
the empty house, to which Mrs Nickleby assented with equal readiness, characteristically
remarking, that, on the fine evenings, it would be a pleasant amusement
for her to walk to the West-end to fetch her daughter home; and no less
characteristically forgetting, that there were such things as wet nights
and bad weather to be encountered in almost every week of the year.

<P>`I shall be sorry--truly sorry to leave you, my kind friend,' said Kate,
on whom the good feeling of the poor miniature painter had made a deep
impression.

<P>`You shall not shake me off, for all that,' replied Miss La Creevy,
with as much sprightliness as she could assume. `I shall see you very often,
and come and hear how you get on; and if, in all London, or all the wide
world besides, there is no other heart that takes an interest in your welfare,
there will be one little lonely woman that prays for it night and day.'

<P>With this, the poor soul, who had a heart big enough for Gog, the guardian
genius of London, and enough to spare for Magog to boot, after making a
great many extraordinary faces which would have secured her an ample fortune,
could she have transferred them to ivory or canvas, sat down in a corner,
and had what she termed `a real good cry.'

<P>But no crying, or talking, or hoping, or fearing, could keep off the
dreaded Saturday afternoon, or Newman Noggs either; who, punctual to his
time, limped up to the door, and breathed a whiff of cordial gin through
the keyhole, exactly as such of the church clocks in the neighbourhood
as agreed among themselves about the time, struck five. Newman waited for
the last stroke, and then knocked.

<P>`From Mr Ralph Nickleby,' said Newman, announcing his errand, when he
got upstairs, with all possible brevity.

<P>`We shall be ready directly,' said Kate. `We have not much to carry,
but I fear we must have a coach.'

<P>`I'll get one,' replied Newman.

<P>`Indeed you shall not trouble yourself,' said Mrs Nickleby.

<P>`I will,' said Newman.

<P>`I can't suffer you to think of such a thing,' said Mrs Nickleby.

<P>`You can't help it,' said Newman.

<P>`Not help it!'

<P>`No; I thought of it as I came along; but didn't get one, thinking you
mightn't be ready. I think of a great many things. Nobody can prevent that.'

<P>`Oh yes, I understand you, Mr Noggs,' said Mrs Nickleby. `Our thoughts
are free, of course. Everybody's thoughts are their own, clearly.'

<P>`They wouldn't be, if some people had their way,' muttered Newman.

<P>`Well, no more they would, Mr Noggs, and that's very true,' rejoined
Mrs Nickleby. `Some people to be sure are such--how's your master?'

<P>Newman darted a meaning glance at Kate, and replied with a strong emphasis
on the last word of his answer, that Mr Ralph Nickleby was well, and sent
his <I>love</I>.

<P>`I am sure we are very much obliged to him,' observed Mrs Nickleby.

<P>`Very,' said Newman. `I'll tell him so.'

<P>It was no very easy matter to mistake Newman Noggs, after having once
seen him, and as Kate, attracted by the singularity of his manner (in which
on this occasion, however, there was something respectful and even delicate,
notwithstanding the abruptness of his speech), looked at him more closely,
she recollected having caught a passing glimpse of that strange figure
before.

<P>`Excuse my curiosity,' she said, `but did I not see you in the coachyard,
on the morning my brother went away to Yorkshire?'

<P>Newman cast a wistful glance on Mrs Nickleby and said `No,' most unblushingly.

<P>`No!' exclaimed Kate, `I should have said so anywhere.'

<P>`You'd have said wrong,' rejoined Newman. `It's the first time I've
been out for three weeks. I've had the gout.'

<P>Newman was very, very far from having the appearance of a gouty subject,
and so Kate could not help thinking; but the conference was cut short by
Mrs Nickleby's insisting on having the door shut, lest Mr Noggs should
take cold, and further persisting in sending the servant girl for a coach,
for fear he should bring on another attack of his disorder. To both conditions,
Newman was compelled to yield. Presently, the coach came; and, after many
sorrowful farewells, and a great deal of running backwards and forwards
across the pavement on the part of Miss La Creevy, in the course of which
the yellow turban came into violent contact with sundry foot-passengers,
it (that is to say the coach, not the turban) went away again, with the
two ladies and their luggage inside; and Newman, despite all Mrs Nickleby's
assurances that it would be his death--on the box beside the driver.

<P>They went into the City, turning down by the river side; and, after
a long and very slow drive, the streets being crowded at that hour with
vehicles of every kind, stopped in front of a large old dingy house in
Thames Street: the door and windows of which were so bespattered with mud,
that it would have appeared to have been uninhabited for years.

<P>The door of this deserted mansion Newman opened with a key which he
took out of his hat--in which, by-the-bye, in consequence of the dilapidated
state of his pockets, he deposited everything, and would most likely have
carried his money if he had had any--and the coach being discharged, he
led the way into the interior of the mansion.

<P>Old, and gloomy, and black, in truth it was, and sullen and dark were
the rooms, once so bustling with life and enterprise. There was a wharf
behind, opening on the Thames. An empty dog-kennel, some bones of animals,
fragments of iron hoops, and staves of old casks, lay strewn about, but
no life was stirring there. It was a picture of cold, silent decay.

<P>`This house depresses and chills one,' said Kate, `and seems as if some
blight had fallen on it. If I were superstitious, I should be almost inclined
to believe that some dreadful crime had been perpetrated within these old
walls, and that the place had never prospered since. How frowning and how
dark it looks!'

<P>`Lord, my dear,' replied Mrs Nickleby, `don't talk in that way, or you'll
frighten me to death.'

<P>`It is only my foolish fancy, mamma,' said Kate, forcing a smile.

<P>`Well, then, my love, I wish you would keep your foolish fancy to yourself,
and not wake up <I>my</I> foolish fancy to keep it company,' retorted Mrs
Nickleby. `Why didn't you think of all this before--you are so careless--we
might have asked Miss La Creevy to keep us company or borrowed a dog, or
a thousand things--but it always was the way, and was just the same with
your poor dear father. Unless I thought of everything--' This was Mrs Nickleby's
usual commencement of a general lamentation, running through a dozen or
so of complicated sentences addressed to nobody in particular, and into
which she now launched until her breath was exhausted.

<P>Newman appeared not to hear these remarks, but preceded them to a couple
of rooms on the first floor, which some kind of attempt had been made to
render habitable. In one, were a few chairs, a table, an old hearth-rug,
and some faded baize; and a fire was ready laid in the grate. In the other
stood an old tent bedstead, and a few scanty articles of chamber furniture.

<P>`Well, my dear,' said Mrs Nickleby, trying to be pleased, `now isn't
this thoughtful and considerate of your uncle? Why, we should not have
had anything but the bed we bought yesterday, to lie down upon, if it hadn't
been for his thoughtfulness!'

<P>`Very kind, indeed,' replied Kate, looking round.

<P>Newman Noggs did not say that he had hunted up the old furniture they
saw, from attic and cellar; or that he had taken in the halfpennyworth
of milk for tea that stood upon a shelf, or filled the rusty kettle on
the hob, or collected the woodchips from the wharf, or begged the coals.
But the notion of Ralph Nickleby having directed it to be done, tickled
his fancy so much, that he could not refrain from cracking all his ten
fingers in succession: at which performance Mrs Nickleby was rather startled
at first, but supposing it to be in some remote manner connected with the
gout, did not remark upon.

<P>`We need detain you no longer, I think,' said Kate.

<P>`Is there nothing I can do?' asked Newman.

<P>`Nothing, thank you,' rejoined Miss Nickleby.

<P>`Perhaps, my dear, Mr Noggs would like to drink our healths,' said Mrs
Nickleby, fumbling in her reticule for some small coin.

<P>`I think, mamma,' said Kate hesitating, and remarking Newman's averted
face, `you would hurt his feelings if you offered it.'

<P>Newman Noggs, bowing to the young lady more like a gentleman than the
miserable wretch he seemed, placed his hand upon his breast, and, pausing
for a moment, with the air of a man who struggles to speak but is uncertain
what to say, quitted the room.

<P>As the jarring echoes of the heavy house-door, closing on its latch,
reverberated dismally through the building, Kate felt half tempted to call
him back, and beg him to remain a little while; but she was ashamed to
own her fears, and Newman Noggs was on his road homewards.
