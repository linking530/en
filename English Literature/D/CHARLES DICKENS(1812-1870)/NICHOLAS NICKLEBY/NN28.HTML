<P>T<FONT SIZE=-1>HE ENSUING MORNING</FONT> brought reflection with it,
as morning usually does; but widely different was the train of thought
it awakened in the different persons who had been so unexpectedly brought
together on the preceding evening, by the active agency of Messrs Pyke
and Pluck.

<P>The reflections of Sir Mulberry Hawk -- if such a term can be applied
to the thoughts of the systematic and calculating man of dissipation, whose
joys, regrets, pains, and pleasures, are all of self, and who would seem
to retain nothing of the intellectual faculty but the power to debase himself,
and to degrade the very nature whose outward semblance he wears -- the
reflections of Sir Mulberry Hawk turned upon Kate Nickleby, and were, in
brief, that she was undoubtedly handsome; that her coyness <I>must</I>
be easily conquerable by a man of his address and experience, and that
the pursuit was one which could not fail to redound to his credit, and
greatly to enhance his reputation with the world. And lest this last consideration
-- no mean or secondary one with Sir Mulberry -- should sound strangely
in the ears of some, let it be remembered that most men live in a world
of their own, and that in that limited circle alone are they ambitious
for distinction and applause. Sir Mulberry's world was peopled with profligates,
and he acted accordingly.

<P>Thus, cases of injustice, and oppression, and tyranny, and the most
extravagant bigotry, are in constant occurrence among us every day. It
is the custom to trumpet forth much wonder and astonishment at the chief
actors therein setting at defiance so completely the opinion of the world;
but there is no greater fallacy; it is precisely because they do consult
the opinion of their own little world that such things take place at all,
and strike the great world dumb with amazement.

<P>The reflections of Mrs Nickleby were of the proudest and most complacent
kind; and under the influence of her very agreeable delusion she straightway
sat down and indited a long letter to Kate, in which she expressed her
entire approval of the admirable choice she had made, and extolled Sir
Mulberry to the skies; asserting, for the more complete satisfaction of
her daughter's feelings, that he was precisely the individual whom she
(Mrs Nickleby) would have chosen for her son-in-law, if she had had the
picking and choosing from all mankind. The good lady then, with the preliminary
observation that she might be fairly supposed not to have lived in the
world so long without knowing its ways, communicated a great many subtle
precepts applicable to the state of courtship, and confirmed in their wisdom
by her own personal experience. Above all things she commended a strict
maidenly reserve, as being not only a very laudable thing in itself, but
as tending materially to strengthen and increase a lover's ardour. `And
I never,' added Mrs Nickleby, `was more delighted in my life than to observe
last night, my dear, that your good sense had already told you this.' With
which sentiment, and various hints of the pleasure she derived from the
knowledge that her daughter inherited so large an instalment of her own
excellent sense and discretion (to nearly the full measure of which she
might hope, with care, to succeed in time), Mrs Nickleby concluded a very
long and rather illegible letter.

<P>Poor Kate was well-nigh distracted on the receipt of four closely-written
and closely-crossed sides of congratulation on the very subject which had
prevented her closing her eyes all night, and kept her weeping and watching
in her chamber; still worse and more trying was the necessity of rendering
herself agreeable to Mrs Wititterly, who, being in low spirits after the
fatigue of the preceding night, of course expected her companion (else
wherefore had she board and salary?) to be in the best spirits possible.
As to Mr Wititterly, he went about all day in a tremor of delight at having
shaken hands with a lord, and having actually asked him to come and see
him in his own house. The lord himself, not being troubled to any inconvenient
extent with the power of thinking, regaled himself with the conversation
of Messrs Pyke and Pluck, who sharpened their wit by a plentiful indulgence
in various costly stimulants at his expense.

<P>It was four in the afternoon -- that is, the vulgar afternoon of the
sun and the clock -- and Mrs Wititterly reclined, according to custom,
on the drawing-room sofa, while Kate read aloud a new novel in three volumes,
entitled `The Lady Flabella,' which Alphonse the doubtful had procured
from the library that very morning. And it was a production admirably suited
to a lady labouring under Mrs Wititterly's complaint, seeing that there
was not a line in it, from beginning to end, which could, by the most remote
contingency, awaken the smallest excitement in any person breathing.

<P>Kate read on.

<P>`"Cherizette," said the Lady Flabella, inserting her mouse-like feet
in the blue satin slippers, which had unwittingly occasioned the half-playful
half-angry altercation between herself and the youthful Colonel Befillaire,
in the Duke of Mincefenille's <I>salon de danse</I> on the previous night.
"<I>Cherizette, ma chere, donnez-moi de l'eau-de-Cologne, s'il vous plait,
mon enfant</I>."

<P>`"<I>Mercie</I> -- thank you," said the Lady Flabella, as the lively
but devoted Cherizette plentifully besprinkled with the fragrant compound
the Lady Flabella's <I>mouchoir</I> of finest cambric, edged with richest
lace, and emblazoned at the four corners with the Flabella crest, and gorgeous
heraldic bearings of that noble family. "<I>Mercie</I> -- that will do."

<P>`At this instant, while the Lady Flabella yet inhaled that delicious
fragrance by holding the <I>mouchoir</I> to her exquisite, but thoughtfully-chiselled
nose, the door of the <I>boudoir</I> (artfully concealed by rich hangings
of silken damask, the hue of Italy's firmament) was thrown open, and with
noiseless tread two <I>valets-de-chambre</I>, clad in sumptuous liveries
of peach-blossom and gold, advanced into the room followed by a page in
<I>bas de soie</I> -- silk stockings -- who, while they remained at some
distance making the most graceful obeisances, advanced to the feet of his
lovely mistress, and dropping on one knee presented, on a golden salver
gorgeously chased, a scented <I>billet</I>.

<P>`The Lady Flabella, with an agitation she could not repress, hastily
tore off the <I>envelope</I> and broke the scented seal. It <I>was</I>
from Befillaire -- the young, the slim, the low-voiced -- <I>her own</I>
Befillaire.'

<P>`Oh, charming!' interrupted Kate's patroness, who was sometimes taken
literary. `Poetic, really. Read that description again, Miss Nickleby.'

<P>Kate complied.

<P>`Sweet, indeed!' said Mrs Wititterly, with a sigh. `So voluptuous, is
it not -- so soft?'

<P>`Yes, I think it is,' replied Kate, gently; `very soft.'

<P>`Close the book, Miss Nickleby,' said Mrs Wititterly. `I can hear nothing
more today; I should be sorry to disturb the impression of that sweet description.
Close the book.'

<P>Kate complied, not unwillingly; and, as she did so, Mrs Wititterly raising
her glass with a languid hand, remarked, that she looked pale.

<P>`It was the fright of that -- that noise and confusion last night,'
said Kate.

<P>`How very odd!' exclaimed Mrs Wititterly, with a look of surprise. And
certainly, when one comes to think of it, it <I>was</I> very odd that anything
should have disturbed a companion. A steam-engine, or other ingenious piece
of mechanism out of order, would have been nothing to it.

<P>`How did you come to know Lord Frederick, and those other delightful
creatures, child?' asked Mrs Wititterly, still eyeing Kate through her
glass.

<P>`I met them at my uncle's,' said Kate, vexed to feel that she was colouring
deeply, but unable to keep down the blood which rushed to her face whenever
she thought of that man.

<P>`Have you known them long?'

<P>`No,' rejoined Kate. `Not long.'

<P>`I was very glad of the opportunity which that respectable person, your
mother, gave us of being known to them,' said Mrs Wititterly, in a lofty
manner. `Some friends of ours were on the very point of introducing us,
which makes it quite remarkable.'

<P>This was said lest Miss Nickleby should grow conceited on the honour
and dignity of having known four great people (for Pyke and Pluck were
included among the delightful creatures), whom Mrs Wititterly did not know.
But as the circumstance had made no impression one way or other upon Kate's
mind, the force of the observation was quite lost upon her.

<P>`They asked permission to call,' said Mrs Wititterly. `I gave it them
of course.'

<P>`Do you expect them today?' Kate ventured to inquire.

<P>Mrs Wititterly's answer was lost in the noise of a tremendous rapping
at the street-door, and before it had ceased to vibrate, there drove up
a handsome cabriolet, out of which leaped Sir Mulberry Hawk and his friend
Lord Verisopht.

<P>`They are here now,' said Kate, rising and hurrying away.

<P>`Miss Nickleby!' cried Mrs Wititterly, perfectly aghast at a companion's
attempting to quit the room, without her permission first had and obtained.
`Pray don't think of going.'

<P>`You are very good!' replied Kate. `But --'

<P>`For goodness' sake, don't agitate me by making me speak so much,' said
Mrs Wititterly, with great sharpness. `Dear me, Miss Nickleby, I beg --'

<P>It was in vain for Kate to protest that she was unwell, for the footsteps
of the knockers, whoever they were, were already on the stairs. She resumed
her seat, and had scarcely done so, when the doubtful page darted into
the room and announced, Mr Pyke, and Mr Pluck, and Lord Verisopht, and
Sir Mulberry Hawk, all at one burst.

<P>`The most extraordinary thing in the world,' said Mr Pluck, saluting
both ladies with the utmost cordiality; `the most extraordinary thing.
As Lord Frederick and Sir Mulberry drove up to the door, Pyke and I had
that instant knocked.'

<P>`That instant knocked,' said Pyke.

<P>`No matter how you came, so that you are here,' said Mrs Wititterly,
who, by dint of lying on the same sofa for three years and a half, had
got up quite a little pantomime of graceful attitudes, and now threw herself
into the most striking of the whole series, to astonish the visitors. `I
am delighted, I am sure.'

<P>`And how is Miss Nickleby?' said Sir Mulberry Hawk, accosting Kate,
in a low voice -- not so low, however, but that it reached the ears of
Mrs Wititterly.

<P>`Why, she complains of suffering from the fright of last night,' said
the lady. `I am sure I don't wonder at it, for my nerves are quite torn
to pieces.'

<P>`And yet you look,' observed Sir Mulberry, turning round; `and yet you
look --'

<P>`Beyond everything,' said Mr Pyke, coming to his patron's assistance.
Of course Mr Pluck said the same.

<P>`I am afraid Sir Mulberry is a flatterer, my lord,' said Mrs Wititterly,
turning to that young gentleman, who had been sucking the head of his cane
in silence, and staring at Kate.

<P>`Oh, deyvlish!' replied Verisopht. Having given utterance to which remarkable
sentiment, he occupied himself as before.

<P>`Neither does Miss Nickleby look the worse,' said Sir Mulberry, bending
his bold gaze upon her. `She was always handsome, but upon my soul, ma'am,
you seem to have imparted some of your own good looks to her besides.'

<P>To judge from the glow which suffused the poor girl's countenance after
this speech, Mrs Wititterly might, with some show of reason, have been
supposed to have imparted to it some of that artificial bloom which decorated
her own. Mrs Wititterly admitted, though not with the best grace in the
world, that Kate <I>did</I> look pretty. She began to think, too, that
Sir Mulberry was not quite so agreeable a creature as she had at first
supposed him; for, although a skilful flatterer is a most delightful companion,
if you can keep him all to yourself, his taste becomes very doubtful when
he takes to complimenting other people.

<P>`Pyke,' said the watchful Mr Pluck, observing the effect which the praise
of Miss Nickleby had produced.

<P>`Well, Pluck,' said Pyke.

<P>`Is there anybody,' demanded Mr Pluck, mysteriously, `anybody you know,
that Mrs Wititterly's profile reminds you of?'

<P>`Reminds me of!' answered Pyke. `Of course there is.'

<P>`Who do you mean?' said Pluck, in the same mysterious manner. `The D.
of B.?'

<P>`The C. of B.,' replied Pyke, with the faintest trace of a grin lingering
in his countenance. `The beautiful sister is the countess; not the duchess.'

<P>`True,' said Pluck, `the C. of B. The resemblance is wonderful!'

<P>`Perfectly startling,' said Mr Pyke.

<P>Here was a state of things! Mrs Wititterly was declared, upon the testimony
of two veracious and competent witnesses, to be the very picture of a countess!
This was one of the consequences of getting into good society. Why, she
might have moved among grovelling people for twenty years, and never heard
of it. How could she, indeed? what did <I>they</I> know about countesses?

<P>The two gentlemen having, by the greediness with which this little bait
was swallowed, tested the extent of Mrs Wititterly's appetite for adulation,
proceeded to administer that commodity in very large doses, thus affording
to Sir Mulberry Hawk an opportunity of pestering Miss Nickleby with questions
and remarks, to which she was absolutely obliged to make some reply. Meanwhile,
Lord Verisopht enjoyed unmolested the full flavour of the gold knob at
the top of his cane, as he would have done to the end of the interview
if Mr Wititterly had not come home, and caused the conversation to turn
to his favourite topic.

<P>`My lord,' said Mr Wititterly, `I am delighted -- honoured -- proud.
Be seated again, my lord, pray. I am proud, indeed -- most proud.'

<P>It was to the secret annoyance of his wife that Mr Wititterly said all
this, for, although she was bursting with pride and arrogance, she would
have had the illustrious guests believe that their visit was quite a common
occurrence, and that they had lords and baronets to see them every day
in the week. But Mr Wititterly's feelings were beyond the power of suppression.

<P>`It is an honour, indeed!' said Mr Wititterly. `Julia, my soul, you
will suffer for this tomorrow.'

<P>`Suffer!' cried Lord Verisopht.

<P>`The reaction, my lord, the reaction,' said Mr Wititterly. `This violent
strain upon the nervous system over, my lord, what ensues? A sinking, a
depression, a lowness, a lassitude, a debility. My lord, if Sir Tumley
Snuffim was to see that delicate creature at this moment, he would not
give a -- a -- <I>this</I> for her life.' In illustration of which remark,
Mr Wititterly took a pinch of snuff from his box, and jerked it lightly
into the air as an emblem of instability.

<P>`Not <I>that</I>,' said Mr Wititterly, looking about him with a seriouscountenance.
`Sir Tumley Snuffim would not give that for Mrs Wititterly's existence.'

<P>Mr Wititterly told this with a kind of sober exultation, as if it were
no trifling distinction for a man to have a wife in such a desperate state,
and Mrs Wititterly sighed and looked on, as if she felt the honour, but
had determined to bear it as meekly as might be.

<P>`Mrs Wititterly,' said her husband, `is Sir Tumley Snuffim's favourite
patient. I believe I may venture to say, that Mrs Wititterly is the first
person who took the new medicine which is supposed to have destroyed a
family at Kensington Gravel Pits. I believe she was. If I am wrong, Julia,
my dear, you will correct me.'

<P>`I believe I was,' said Mrs Wititterly, in a faint voice.

<P>As there appeared to be some doubt in the mind of his patron how he
could best join in this conversation, the indefatigable Mr Pyke threw himself
into the breach, and, by way of saying something to the point, inquired
-- with reference to the aforesaid medicine -- whether it was nice.

<P>`No, sir, it was not. It had not even that recommendation,' said Mr
W.

<P>`Mrs Wititterly is quite a martyr,' observed Pyke, with a complimentary
bow.

<P>`I <I>think</I> I am,' said Mrs Wititterly, smiling.

<P>`I think you are, my dear Julia,' replied her husband, in a tone which
seemed to say that he was not vain, but still must insist upon their privileges.
`If anybody, my lord,' added Mr Wititterly, wheeling round to the nobleman,
`will produce to me a greater martyr than Mrs Wititterly, all I can say
is, that I shall be glad to see that martyr, whether male or female --
that's all, my lord.'

<P>Pyke and Pluck promptly remarked that certainly nothing could be fairer
than that; and the call having been by this time protracted to a very great
length, they obeyed Sir Mulberry's look, and rose to go. This brought Sir
Mulberry himself and Lord Verisopht on their legs also. Many protestations
of friendship, and expressions anticipative of the pleasure which must
inevitably flow from so happy an acquaintance, were exchanged, and the
visitors departed, with renewed assurances that at all times and seasons
the mansion of the Wititterlys would be honoured by receiving them beneath
its roof.

<P>That they came at all times and seasons -- that they dined there one
day, supped the next, dined again on the next, and were constantly to and
fro on all -- that they made parties to visit public places, and met by
accident at lounges -- that upon all these occasions Miss Nickleby was
exposed to the constant and unremitting persecution of Sir Mulberry Hawk,
who now began to feel his character, even in the estimation of his two
dependants, involved in the successful reduction of her pride -- that she
had no intervals of peace or rest, except at those hours when she could
sit in her solitary room, and weep over the trials of the day -- all these
were consequences naturally flowing from the well-laid plans of Sir Mulberry,
and their able execution by the auxiliaries, Pyke and Pluck.

<P>And thus for a fortnight matters went on. That any but the weakest and
silliest of people could have seen in one interview that Lord Verisopht,
though he was a lord, and Sir Mulberry Hawk, though he was a baronet, were
not persons accustomed to be the best possible companions, and were certainly
not calculated by habits, manners, tastes, or conversation, to shine with
any very great lustre in the society of ladies, need scarcely be remarked.
But with Mrs Wititterly the two titles were all sufficient; coarseness
became humour, vulgarity softened itself down into the most charming eccentricity;
insolence took the guise of an easy absence of reserve, attainable only
by those who had had the good fortune to mix with high folks.

<P>If the mistress put such a construction upon the behaviour of her new
friends, what could the companion urge against them? If they accustomed
themselves to very little restraint before the lady of the house, with
how much more freedom could they address her paid dependent! Nor was even
this the worst. As the odious Sir Mulberry Hawk attached himself to Kate
with less and less of disguise, Mrs Wititterly began to grow jealous of
the superior attractions of Miss Nickleby. If this feeling had led to her
banishment from the drawing-room when such company was there, Kate would
have been only too happy and willing that it should have existed, but unfortunately
for her she possessed that native grace and true gentility of manner, and
those thousand nameless accomplishments which give to female society its
greatest charm; if these be valuable anywhere, they were especially so
where the lady of the house was a mere animated doll. The consequence was,
that Kate had the double mortification of being an indispensable part of
the circle when Sir Mulberry and his friends were there, and of being exposed,
on that very account, to all Mrs Wititterly's ill-humours and caprices
when they were gone. She became utterly and completely miserable.

<P>Mrs Wititterly had never thrown off the mask with regard to Sir Mulberry,
but when she was more than usually out of temper, attributed the circumstance,
as ladies sometimes do, to nervous indisposition. However, as the dreadful
idea that Lord Verisopht also was somewhat taken with Kate, and that she,
Mrs Wititterly, was quite a secondary person, dawned upon that lady's mind
and gradually developed itself, she became possessed with a large quantity
of highly proper and most virtuous indignation, and felt it her duty, as
a married lady and a moral member of society, to mention the circumstance
to `the young person' without delay.

<P>Accordingly Mrs Wititterly broke ground next morning, during a pause
in the novel-reading.

<P>`Miss Nickleby,' said Mrs Wititterly, `I wish to speak to you very gravely.
I am sorry to have to do it, upon my word I am very sorry, but you leave
me no alternative, Miss Nickleby.' Here Mrs Wititterly tossed her head
-- not passionately, only virtuously -- and remarked, with some appearance
of excitement, that she feared that palpitation of the heart was coming
on again.

<P>`Your behaviour, Miss Nickleby,' resumed the lady, `is very far from
pleasing me -- very far. I am very anxious indeed that you should do well,
but you may depend upon it, Miss Nickleby, you will not, if you go on as
you do.'

<P>`Ma'am!' exclaimed Kate, proudly.

<P>`Don't agitate me by speaking in that way, Miss Nickleby, don't,' said
Mrs Wititterly, with some violence, `or you'll compel me to ring the bell.'

<P>Kate looked at her, but said nothing.

<P>`You needn't suppose,' resumed Mrs Wititterly, `that your looking at
me in that way, Miss Nickleby, will prevent my saying what I am going to
say, which I feel to be a religious duty. You needn't direct your glances
towards me,' said Mrs Wititterly, with a sudden burst of spite; `<I>I</I>
am not Sir Mulberry, no, nor Lord Frederick Verisopht, Miss Nickleby, nor
am I Mr Pyke, nor Mr Pluck either.'

<P>Kate looked at her again, but less steadily than before; and resting
her elbow on the table, covered her eyes with her hand.

<P>`If such things had been done when I was a young girl,' said Mrs Wititterly
(this, by the way, must have been some little time before), `I don't suppose
anybody would have believed it.'

<P>`I don't think they would,' murmured Kate. `I do not think anybody would
believe, without actually knowing it, what I seem doomed to undergo!'

<P>`Don't talk to me of being doomed to undergo, Miss Nickleby, if you
please,' said Mrs Wititterly, with a shrillness of tone quite surprising
in so great an invalid. `I will not be answered, Miss Nickleby. I am not
accustomed to be answered, nor will I permit it for an instant. Do you
hear?' she added, waiting with some apparent inconsistency <I>for</I> an
answer.

<P>`I do hear you, ma'am,' replied Kate, `with surprise -- with greater
surprise than I can express.'

<P>`I have always considered you a particularly well-behaved young person
for your station in life,' said Mrs Wititterly; `and as you are a person
of healthy appearance, and neat in your dress and so forth, I have taken
an interest in you, as I do still, considering that I owe a sort of duty
to that respectable old female, your mother. For these reasons, Miss Nickleby,
I must tell you once for all, and begging you to mind what I say, that
I must insist upon your immediately altering your very forward behaviour
to the gentleman who visit at this house. It really is not becoming,' said
Mrs Wititterly, closing her chaste eyes as she spoke; `it is improper --
quite improper."

<P>`Oh!' cried Kate, looking upwards and clasping her hands; `is not this,
is not this, too cruel, too hard to bear! Is it not enough that I should
have suffered as I have, night and day; that I should almost have sunk
in my own estimation from very shame of having been brought into contact
with such people; but must I also be exposed to this unjust and most unfounded
charge!'

<P>`You will have the goodness to recollect, Miss Nickleby,' said Mrs Wititterly,
`that when you use such terms as "unjust", and "unfounded", you charge
me, in effect, with stating that which is untrue.'

<P>`I do,' said Kate with honest indignation. `Whether you make this accusation
of yourself, or at the prompting of others, is alike to me. I say it <I>is</I>
vilely, grossly, wilfully untrue. Is it possible!' cried Kate, `that anyone
of my own sex can have sat by, and not have seen the misery these men have
caused me? Is it possible that you, ma'am, can have been present, and failed
to mark the insulting freedom that their every look bespoke? Is it possible
that you can have avoided seeing, that these libertines, in their utter
disrespect for you, and utter disregard of all gentlemanly behaviour, and
almost of decency, have had but one object in introducing themselves here,
and that the furtherance of their designs upon a friendless, helpless girl,
who, without this humiliating confession, might have hoped to receive from
one so much her senior something like womanly aid and sympathy? I do not
-- I cannot believe it!'

<P>If poor Kate had possessed the slightest knowledge of the world, she
certainly would not have ventured, even in the excitement into which she
had been lashed, upon such an injudicious speech as this. Its effect was
precisely what a more experienced observer would have foreseen. Mrs Wititterly
received the attack upon her veracity with exemplary calmness, and listened
with the most heroic fortitude to Kate's account of her own sufferings.
But allusion being made to her being held in disregard by the gentlemen,
she evinced violent emotion, and this blow was no sooner followed up by
the remark concerning her seniority, than she fell back upon the sofa,
uttering dismal screams.

<P>`What is the matter?' cried Mr Wititterly, bouncing into the room. `Heavens,
what do I see? Julia! Julia! look up, my life, look up!'

<P>But Julia looked down most perseveringly, and screamed still louder;
so Mr Wititterly rang the bell, and danced in a frenzied manner round the
sofa on which Mrs Wititterly lay; uttering perpetual cries for Sir Tumley
Snuffim, and never once leaving off to ask for any explanation of the scene
before him.

<P>`Run for Sir Tumley,' cried Mr Wititterly, menacing the page with both
fists. `I knew it, Miss Nickleby,' he said, looking round with an air of
melancholy triumph, `that society has been too much for her. This is all
soul, you know, every bit of it.' With this assurance Mr Wititterly took
up the prostrate form of Mrs Wititterly, and carried her bodily off to
bed.

<P>Kate waited until Sir Tumley Snuffim had paid his visit and looked in
with a report, that, through the special interposition of a merciful Providence
(thus spake Sir Tumley), Mrs Wititterly had gone to sleep. She then hastily
attired herself for walking, and leaving word that she should return within
a couple of hours, hurried away towards her uncle's house.

<P>It had been a good day with Ralph Nickleby -- quite a lucky day; and
as he walked to and fro in his little back-room with his hands clasped
behind him, adding up in his own mind all the sums that had been, or would
be, netted from the business done since morning, his mouth was drawn into
a hard stern smile; while the firmness of the lines and curves that made
it up, as well as the cunning glance of his cold, bright eye, seemed to
tell, that if any resolution or cunning would increase the profits, they
would not fail to be excited for the purpose.

<P>`Very good!' said Ralph, in allusion, no doubt, to some proceeding of
the day. `He defies the usurer, does he? Well, we shall see. "Honesty is
the best policy," is it? We'll try that too.'

<P>He stopped, and then walked on again.

<P>`He is content,' said Ralph, relaxing into a smile, `to set his known
character and conduct against the power of money -- dross, as he calls
it. Why, what a dull blockhead this fellow must be! Dross too -- dross!
-- Who's that?'

<P>`Me,' said Newman Noggs, looking in. `Your niece.'

<P>`What of her?' asked Ralph sharply.

<P>`She's here.'

<P>`Here!'

<P>Newman jerked his head towards his little room, to signify that she
was waiting there.

<P>`What does she want?' asked Ralph.

<P>`I don't know,' rejoined Newman. `Shall I ask?' he added quickly.

<P>`No,' replied Ralph. `Show her in -- stay.' He hastily put away a padlocked
cash-box that was on the table, and substituted in its stead an empty purse.
`There,' said Ralph. `<I>Now</I> she may come in.'

<P>Newman, with a grim smile at this manoeuvre, beckoned the young lady
to advance, and having placed a chair for her, retired; looking stealthily
over his shoulder at Ralph as he limped slowly out.

<P>`Well,' said Ralph, roughly enough; but still with something more of
kindness in his manner than he would have exhibited towards anybody else.
`Well, my -- dear. What now?'

<P>Kate raised her eyes, which were filled with tears; and with an effort
to master her emotion strove to speak, but in vain. So drooping her head
again, she remained silent. Her face was hidden from his view, but Ralph
could see that she was weeping.

<P>`I can guess the cause of this!' thought Ralph, after looking at her
for some time in silence. `I can -- I can guess the cause. Well! Well!'
-- thought Ralph -- for the moment quite disconcerted, as he watched the
anguish of his beautiful niece. `Where is the harm? only a few tears; and
it's an excellent lesson for her -- an excellent lesson.'

<P>`What is the matter?' asked Ralph, drawing a chair opposite, and sitting
down.

<P>He was rather taken aback by the sudden firmness with which Kate looked
up and answered him.

<P>`The matter which brings me to you, sir,' she said, `is one which should
call the blood up into your cheeks, and make you burn to hear, as it does
me to tell. I have been wronged; my feelings have been outraged, insulted,
wounded past all healing, and by your friends.'

<P>`Friends!' cried Ralph, sternly. `<I>I</I> have no friends, girl.'

<P>`By the men I saw here, then,' returned Kate, quickly. `If they were
no friends of yours, and you knew what they were, -- oh, the more shame
on you, uncle, for bringing me among them. To have subjected me to what
I was exposed to here, through any misplaced confidence or imperfect knowledge
of your guests, would have required some strong excuse; but if you did
it -- as I now believe you did -- knowing them well, it was most dastardly
and cruel.'

<P>Ralph drew back in utter amazement at this plain speaking, and regarded
Kate with the sternest look. But she met his gaze proudly and firmly, and
although her face was very pale, it looked more noble and handsome, lighted
up as it was, than it had ever appeared before.

<P>`There is some of that boy's blood in you, I see,' said Ralph, speaking
in his harshest tones, as something in the flashing eye reminded him of
Nicholas at their last meeting.

<P>`I hope there is!' replied Kate. `I should be proud to know it. I am
young, uncle, and all the difficulties and miseries of my situation have
kept it down, but I have been roused today beyond all endurance, and come
what may, <I>I will not</I>, as I am your brother's child, bear these insults
longer.'

<P>`What insults, girl?' demanded Ralph, sharply.

<P>`Remember what took place here, and ask yourself,' replied Kate, colouring
deeply. `Uncle, you must -- I am sure you will -- release me from such
vile and degrading companionship as I am exposed to now. I do not mean,'
said Kate, hurrying to the old man, and laying her arm upon his shoulder;
`I do not mean to be angry and violent -- I beg your pardon if I have seemed
so, dear uncle, -- but you do not know what I have suffered, you do not
indeed. You cannot tell what the heart of a young girl is -- I have no
right to expect you should; but when I tell you that I am wretched, and
that my heart is breaking, I am sure you will help me. I am sure, I am
sure you will!'

<P>Ralph looked at her for an instant; then turned away his head, and beat
his foot nervously upon the ground.

<P>`I have gone on day after day,' said Kate, bending over him, and timidly
placing her little hand in his, `in the hope that this persecution would
cease; I have gone on day after day, compelled to assume the appearance
of cheerfulness, when I was most unhappy. I have had no counsellor, no
adviser, no one to protect me. Mamma supposes that these are honourable
men, rich and distinguished, and how <I>can</I> I -- how can I undeceive
her -- when she is so happy in these little delusions, which are the only
happiness she has? The lady with whom you placed me, is not the person
to whom I could confide matters of so much delicacy, and I have come at
last to you, the only friend I have at hand -- almost the only friend I
have at all -- to entreat and implore you to assist me.'

<P>`How can <I>I</I> assist you, child?' said Ralph, rising from his chair,
and pacing up and down the room in his old attitude.

<P>`You have influence with one of these men, I <I>know</I>,' rejoined
Kate, emphatically. `Would not a word from you induce them to desist from
this unmanly course?'

<P>`No,' said Ralph, suddenly turning; `at least -- that -- I can't say
it, if it would.'

<P>`Can't say it!'

<P>`No,' said Ralph, coming to a dead stop, and clasping his hands more
tightly behind him. `I can't say it.'

<P>Kate fell back a step or two, and looked at him, as if in doubt whether
she had heard aright.

<P>`We are connected in business,' said Ralph, poising himself alternately
on his toes and heels, and looking coolly in his niece's face, `in business,
and I can't afford to offend them. What is it after all? We have all our
trials, and this is one of yours. Some girls would be proud to have such
gallants at their feet.'

<P>`Proud!' cried Kate.

<P>`I don't say,' rejoined Ralph, raising his forefinger, `but that you
do right to despise them; no, you show your good sense in that, as indeed
I knew from the first you would. Well. In all other respects you are comfortably
bestowed. It's not much to bear. If this young lord does dog your footsteps,
and whisper his drivelling inanities in your ears, what of it? It's a dishonourable
passion. So be it; it won't last long. Some other novelty will spring up
one day, and you will be released. In the meantime --'

<P>`In the meantime,' interrupted Kate, with becoming pride and indignation,
`I am to be the scorn of my own sex, and the toy of the other; justly condemned
by all women of right feeling, and despised by all honest and honourable
men; sunken in my own esteem, and degraded in every eye that looks upon
me. No, not if I work my fingers to the bone, not if I am driven to the
roughest and hardest labour. Do not mistake me. I will not disgrace your
recommendation. I will remain in the house in which it placed me, until
I am entitled to leave it by the terms of my engagement; -- though, mind,
I see these men no more. When I quit it, I will hide myself from them and
you, and, striving to support my mother by hard service, I will live, at
least, in peace, and trust in God to help me.'

<P>With these words, she waved her hand, and quitted the room, leaving
Ralph Nickleby motionless as a statue.

<P>The surprise with which Kate, as she closed the room-door, beheld, close
beside it, Newman Noggs standing bolt upright in a little niche in the
wall like some scarecrow or Guy Faux laid up in winter quarters, almost
occasioned her to call aloud. But, Newman laying his finger upon his lips,
she had the presence of mind to refrain.

<P>`Don't,' said Newman, gliding out of his recess, and accompanying her
across the hall. `Don't cry, don't cry.' Two very large tears, by-the-bye,
were running down Newman's face as he spoke.

<P>`I see how it is,' said poor Noggs, drawing from his pocket what seemed
to be a very old duster, and wiping Kate's eyes with it, as gently as if
she were an infant. `You're giving way now. Yes, yes, very good; that's
right, I like that. It was right not to give way before him. Yes, yes!
Ha, ha, ha! Oh, yes. Poor thing!'

<P>With these disjointed exclamations, Newman wiped his own eyes with the
afore-mentioned duster, and, limping to the street-door, opened it to let
her out.

<P>`Don't cry any more,' whispered Newman. `I shall see you soon. Ha! ha!
ha! And so shall somebody else too. Yes, yes. Ho! ho!'

<P>`God bless you,' answered Kate, hurrying out, `God bless you.'

<P>`Same to you,' rejoined Newman, opening the door again a little way
to say so. `Ha, ha, ha! Ho! ho! ho!'

<P>And Newman Noggs opened the door once again to nod cheerfully, and laugh
-- and shut it, to shake his head mournfully, and cry.

<P>Ralph remained in the same attitude till he heard the noise of the closing
door, when he shrugged his shoulders, and after a few turns about the room
-- hasty at first, but gradually becoming slower, as he relapsed into himself
-- sat down before his desk.

<P>It is one of those problems of human nature, which may be noted down,
but not solved; -- although Ralph felt no remorse at that moment for his
conduct towards the innocent, true-hearted girl; although his libertine
clients had done precisely what he had expected, precisely what he most
wished, and precisely what would tend most to his advantage, still he hated
them for doing it, from the very bottom of his soul.

<P>`Ugh!' said Ralph, scowling round, and shaking his clenched hand as
the faces of the two profligates rose up before his mind; `you shall pay
for this. Oh! you shall pay for this!'

<P>As the usurer turned for consolation to his books and papers, a performance
was going on outside his office door, which would have occasioned him no
small surprise, if he could by any means have become acquainted with it.

<P>Newman Noggs was the sole actor. He stood at a little distance from
the door, with his face towards it; and with the sleeves of his coat turned
back at the wrists, was occupied in bestowing the most vigorous, scientific,
and straightforward blows upon the empty air.

<P>At first sight, this would have appeared merely a wise precaution in
a man of sedentary habits, with the view of opening the chest and strengthening
the muscles of the arms. But the intense eagerness and joy depicted in
the face of Newman Noggs, which was suffused with perspiration; the surprising
energy with which he directed a constant succession of blows towards a
particular panel about five feet eight from the ground, and still worked
away in the most untiring and persevering manner, would have sufficiently
explained to the attentive observer, that his imagination was thrashing,
to within an inch of his life, his body's most active employer, Mr Ralph
Nickleby.
