<P>I<FONT SIZE=-1>N THAT QUARTER OF</FONT> L<FONT SIZE=-1>ONDON</FONT>
in which Golden Square is situated, there is a bygone, faded, tumble-down
street, with two irregular rows of tall meagre houses, which seem to have
stared each other out of countenance, years ago. The very chimneys appear
to have grown dismal and melancholy, from having had nothing better to
look at than the chimneys over the way. Their tops are battered, and broken,
and blackened with smoke; and, here and there, some taller stack than the
rest, inclining heavily to one side, and toppling over the roof, seems
to mediate taking revenge for half a century's neglect, by crushing the
inhabitants of the garrests beneath.

<P>The fowls who peck about the kennels, jerking their bodies hither and
thither with a gait which none but town fowls are ever seen to adopt, and
which any country cock or hen would be puzzled to understand, are perfectly
in keeping with the crazy habitations of their owners. Dingy, ill-plumed,
drowsy flutterers, sent, like many of the neighbouring children, to get
a livelihood in the streets, they hop, from stone to stone, in forlorn
search of some hidden eatable in the mud, and can scarcely raise a crow
among them. The only one with anything approaching to a voice, is an aged
bantam at the baker's; and even he is hoarse, in consequence of bad living
in his last place.

<P>To judge from the size of the houses, they have been, at one time, tenanted
by persons of better condition than their present occupants; but they are
now let off, by the week, in floors or rooms, and every door has almost
as many plates or belf-handles as there are apartments within. The windows
are, for the same reason, sufficiently diversified in appearance, being
ornamented with every variety of common blind and curtain that can easily
be imagined; while every doorway is blocked up, and rendered nearly impassable,
by a motley collection of children and porter pots of all sizes, from the
baby in arms and the half-pint pot, to the full-grown girl and half-gallon
can.

<P>In the parlour of one of these houses, which was perhaps a thought dirtier
than any of its neighbours; which exhibited more bell-handles, children,
and porter pots, and caught in all its freshness the first gust of the
thick black smoke that poured forth, night and day, from a large brewery
hard by; hung a bill, announcing that there was yet one room to let within
its walls, though on what story the vacant room could be--regard being
had to the outward tokens of many lodgers which the whole front displayed,
from the mangle in the kitchen window to the flower-pots on the parapet--it
would have been beyond the power of a calculating boy to discover.

<P>The common stairs of this mansion were bare and carpetless; but a curious
visitor who had to climb his way to the top, might have observed that there
were not wanting indications of the progressive poverty of the inmates,
although their rooms were shut. Thus, the first-floor lodgers, being flush
of furniture, kept an old mahogany table--real mahogany--on the landing-place
outside, which was only taken in, when occasion required. On the second
story, the spare furniture dwindled down to a couple of old deal chairs,
of which one, belonging to the back-room, was shorn of a leg, and bottomless.
The story above, boasted no greater excess than a worm-eaten wash-tub;
and the garret landing-place displayed no costlier articles than two crippled
pitchers, and some broken blacking-bottles.

<P>It was on this garret landing-place that a hard-featured square-faced
man, elderly and shabby, stopped to unlock the door of the front attic,
into which, having surmounted the task of turning the rusty key in its
still more rusty wards, he walked with the air of legal owner.

<P>This person wore a wig of short, coarse, red hair, which he took off
with his hat, and hung upon a nail. Having adopted in its place a dirty
cotton nightcap, and groped about in the dark till he found a remnant of
candle, he knocked at the partition which divided the two garrets, and
inquired, in a loud voice, whether Mr Noggs had a light.

<P>The sounds that came back were stifled by the lath and plaster, and
it seemed moreover as though the speaker had uttered them from the interior
of a mug or other drinking vessel; but they were in the voice of Newman,
and conveyed a reply in the affirmative.

<P>`A nasty night, Mr Noggs!' said the man in the nightcap, stepping in
to light his candle.

<P>`Does it rain?' asked Newman.

<P>`Does it?' replied the other pettishly. `I am wet through.'

<P>`It doesn't take much to wet you and me through, Mr Crowl,' said Newman,
laying his hand upon the lappel of his threadbare coat.

<P>`Well; and that makes it the more vexatious,' observed Mr Crowl, in
the same pettish tone.

<P>Uttering a low querulous growl, the speaker, whose harsh countenance
was the very epitome of selfishness, raked the scanty fire nearly out of
the grate, and, emptying the glass which Noggs had pushed towards him,
inquired where he kept his coals.

<P>Newman Noggs pointed to the bottom of a cupboard, and Mr Crowl, seizing
the shovel, threw on half the stock: which Noggs very deliberately took
off again, without saying a word.

<P>`You have not turned saving, at this time of day, I hope?' said Crowl.

<P>Newman pointed to the empty glass, as though it were a sufficient refutation
of the charge, and briefly said that he was going downstairs to supper.

<P>`To the Kenwigses?' asked Crowl.

<P>Newman nodded assent.

<P>`Think of that now!' said Crowl. `If I didn't--thinking that you were
certain not to go, because you said you wouldn't--tell Kenwigs I couldn't
come, and make up my mind to spend the evening with you!'

<P>`I was obliged to go,' said Newman. `They would have me.'

<P>`Well; but what's to become of me?' urged the selfish man, who never
thought of anybody else. `It's all your fault. I'll tell you what--I'll
sit by your fire till you come back again.'

<P>Newman cast a despairing glance at his small store of fuel, but, not
having the courage to say no--a word which in all his life he never had
said at the right time, either to himself or anyone else--gave way to the
proposed arrangement. Mr Crowl immediately went about making himself as
comfortable, with Newman Nogg's means, as circumstances would admit of
his being made.

<P>The lodgers to whom Crowl had made allusion under the designation of
`the Kenwigses,' were the wife and olive branches of one Mr Kenwigs, a
turner in ivory, who was looked upon as a person of some consideration
on the premises, inasmuch as he occupied the whole of the first floor,
comprising a suite of two rooms. Mrs Kenwigs, too, was quite a lady in
her manners, and of a very genteel family, having an uncle who collected
a water-rate; besides which distinction, the two eldest of her little girls
went twice a week to a dancing school in the neighbourhood, and had flaxen
hair, tied with blue ribbons, hanging in luxuriant pigtails down their
backs; and wore little white trousers with frills round the ankles--for
all of which reasons, and many more equally valid but too numerous to mention,
Mrs Kenwigs was considered a very desirable person to know, and was the
constant theme of all the gossips in the street, and even three or four
doors round the corner at both ends.

<P>It was the anniversary of that happy day on which the Church of England
as by law established, had bestowed Mrs Kenwigs upon Mr Kenwigs; and in
grateful commemoration of the same, Mrs Kenwigs had invited a few select
friends to cards and a supper in the first floor, and had put on a new
gown to receive them in: which gown, being of a flaming colour and made
upon a juvenile principle, was so successful that Mr Kenwigs said the eight
years of matrimony and the five children seemed all a dream, and Mrs Kenwigs
younger and more blooming than on the very first Sunday he had kept company
with her.

<P>Beautiful as Mrs Kenwigs looked when she was dressed though, and so
stately that you would have supposed she had a cook and housemaid at least,
and nothing to do but order them about, she had a world of trouble with
the preparations; more, indeed, than she, being of a delicate and genteel
constitution, could have sustained, had not the pride of housewifery upheld
her. At last, however, all the things that had to be got together were
got together, and all the things that had to be got out of the way were
got out of the way, and everything was ready, and the collector himself
having promised to come, fortune smiled upon the occasion.

<P>The party was admirably selected. There were, first of all, Mr Kenwigs
and Mrs Kenwigs, and four olive Kenwigses who sat up to supper; firstly,
because it was but right that they should have a treat on such a day; and
secondly, because their going to bed, in presence of the company, would
have been inconvenient, not to say improper. Then, there was a young lady
who had made Mrs Kenwigs's dress, and who--it was the most convenient thing
in the world--living in the two-pair back, gave up her bed to the baby,
and got a little girl to watch it. Then, to match this young lady, was
a young man, who had known Mr Kenwigs when he was a bachelor, and was much
esteemed by the ladies, as bearing the reputation of a rake. To these were
added a newly-married couple, who had visited Mr and Mrs Kenwigs in their
courtship; and a sister of Mrs Kenwigs's, who was quite a beauty; besides
whom, there was another young man, supposed to entertain honourable designs
upon the lady last mentioned; and Mr Noggs, who was a genteel person to
ask, because he had been a gentleman once. There were also an elderly lady
from the back-parlour, and one more young lady, who, next to the collector,
perhaps was the great lion of the party, being the daughter of a theatrical
fireman, who `went on `in the pantomime, and had the greatest turn for
the stage that was ever known, being able to sing and recite in a manner
that brought the tears into Mrs Kenwigs's eyes. There was only one drawback
upon the pleasure of seeing such friends, and that was, that the lady in
the back-parlour, who was very fat, and turned of sixty, came in a low
book-muslin dress and short kid gloves, which so exasperated Mrs Kenwigs,
that that lady assured her visitors, in private, that if it hadn't happened
that the supper was cooking at the back-parlour grate at that moment, she
certainly would have requested its representative to withdraw.

<P>`My dear,' said Mr Kenwigs, `wouldn't it be better to begin a round
game?'

<P>`Kenwigs, my dear,' returned his wife, `I am surprised at you. Would
you begin without my uncle?'

<P>`I forgot the collector,' said Kenwigs; `oh no, that would never do.'

<P>`He's so particular,' said Mrs Kenwigs, turning to the other married
lady, `that if we began without him, I should be out of his will for ever.'

<P>`Dear!' cried the married lady.

<P>`You've no idea what he is,' replied Mrs Kenwigs; `and yet as good a
creature as ever breathed.'

<P>`The kindest-hearted man as ever was,' said Kenwigs.

<P>`It goes to his heart, I believe, to be forced to cut the water off,
when the people don't pay,' observed the bachelor friend, intending a joke.

<P>`George,' said Mr Kenwigs, solemnly, `none of that, if you please.'

<P>`It was only my joke,' said the friend, abashed.

<P>`George,' rejoined Mr Kenwigs, `a joke is a wery good thing--a wery
good thing--but when that joke is made at the expense of Mrs Kenwigs's
feelings, I set my face against it. A man in public life expects to be
sneered at--it is the fault of his elewated sitiwation, and not of himself.
Mrs Kenwigs's relation is a public man, and that he knows, George, and
that he can bear; but putting Mrs Kenwigs out of the question (if I <I>could</I>
put Mrs Kenwigs out of the question on such an occasion as this), I have
the honour to be connected with the collector by marriage; and I cannot
allow these remarks in my--'Mr Kenwigs was going to say `house,' but he
rounded the sentence with `apartments'.

<P>At the conclusion of these observations, which drew forth evidences
of acute feeling from Mrs Kenwigs, and had the intended effect of impressing
the company with a deep sense of the collector's dignity, a ring was heard
at the bell.

<P>`That's him,' whispered Mr Kenwigs, greatly excited. `Morleena, my dear,
run down and let your uncle in, and kiss him directly you get the door
open. Hem! Let's be talking.'

<P>Adopting Mr Kenwigs's suggestion, the company spoke very loudly, to
look easy and unembarrassed; and almost as soon as they had begun to do
so, a short old gentleman in drabs and gaiters, with a face that might
have been carved out of <I>lignum vitae</I>, for anything that appeared
to the contrary, was led playfully in by Miss Morleena Kenwigs, regarding
whose uncommon Christian name it may be here remarked that it had been
invented and composed by Mrs Kenwigs previous to her first lying-in, for
the special distinction of her eldest child, in case it should prove a
daughter.

<P>`Oh, uncle, I am <I>so</I> glad to see you,' said Mrs Kenwigs, kissing
the collector affectionately on both cheeks. `So glad!'

<P>`Many happy returns of the day, my dear,' replied the collector, returning
the compliment.

<P>Now, this was an interesting thing. Here was a collector of water-rates,
without his book, without his pen and ink, without his double knock, without
his intimidation, kissing--actually kissing--an agreeable female, and leaving
taxes, summonses, notices that he had called, or announcements that he
would never call again, for two quarters' due, wholly out of the question.
It was pleasant to see how the company looked on, quite absorbed in the
sight, and to behold the nods and winks with which they expressed their
gratification at finding so much humanity in a tax-gatherer.

<P>`Where will you sit, uncle?' said Mrs Kenwigs, in the full glow of family
pride, which the appearance of her distinguished relation occasioned.

<P>`Anywheres, my dear,' said the collector, `I am not particular.'

<P>Not particular! What a meek collector! If he had been an author, who
knew his place, he couldn't have been more humble.

<P>`Mr Lillyvick,' said Kenwigs, addressing the collector, `some friends
here, sir, are very anxious for the honour of--thank you--Mr and Mrs Cutler,
Mr Lillyvick.'

<P>`Proud to know you, sir,' said Mr Cutler; `I've heerd of you very often.'
These were not mere words of ceremony; for, Mr Cutler, having kept house
in Mr Lillyvick's parish, had heard of him very often indeed. His attention
in calling had been quite extraordinary.

<P>`George, you know, I think, Mr Lillyvick,' said Kenwigs; `lady from
downstairs--Mr Lillyvick. Mr Snewkes--Mr Lillyvick. Miss Green--Mr Lillyvick.
Mr Lillyvick--Miss Petowker of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Very glad
to make two public characters acquainted! Mrs Kenwigs, my dear, will you
sort the counters?'

<P>Mrs Kenwigs, with the assistance of Newman Noggs, (who, as he performed
sundry little acts of kindness for the children, at all times and seasons,
was humoured in his request to be taken no notice of, and was merely spoken
about, in a whisper, as the decayed gentleman), did as he was desired;
and the greater part of the guests sat down to speculation, while Newman
himself, Mrs Kenwigs, and Miss Petowker of the Theatre Royal Drury Lane,
looked after the supper-table.

<P>While the ladies were thus busying themselves, Mr Lillyvick was intent
upon the game in progress, and as all should be fish that comes to a water-collector's
net, the dear old gentleman was by no means scrupulous in appropriating
to himself the property of his neighbours, which, on the contrary, he abstracted
whenever an opportunity presented itself, smiling good-humouredly all the
while, and making so many condescending speeches to the owners, that they
were delighted with his amiability, and thought in their hearts that he
deserved to be Chancellor of the Exchequer at least.

<P>After a great deal of trouble, and the administration of many slaps
on the head to the infant Kenwigses, whereof two of the most rebellious
were summarily banished, the cloth was laid with much elegance, and a pair
of boiled fowls, a large piece of pork, apple-pie, potatoes and greens,
were served; at sight of which, the worthy Mr Lillyvick vented a great
many witticisms, and plucked up amazingly: to the immense delight and satisfaction
of the whole body of admirers.

<P>Very well and very fast the supper went off; no more serious difficulties
occurring, than those which arose from the incessant demand for clean knives
and forks: which made poor Mrs Kenwigs wish, more than once, that private
society adopted the principle of schools, and required that every guest
should bring his own knife, fork, and spoon; which doubtless would be a
great accommodation in many cases, and to no one more so than to the lady
and gentleman of the house, especially if the school principle were carried
out to the full extent, and the articles were expected, as a matter of
delicacy, not to be taken away again.

<P>Everybody having eaten everything, the table was cleared in a most alarming
hurry, and with great noise; and the spirits, whereat the eyes of Newman
Noggs glistened, being arranged in order, with water both hot and cold,
the party composed themselves for conviviality; Mr Lillyvick being stationed
in a large armchair by the fireside, and the four little Kenwigses disposed
on a small form in front of the company with their flaxen tails towards
them, and their faces to the fire; an arrangement which was no sooner perfected,
than Mrs Kenwigs was overpowered by the feelings of a mother, and fell
upon the left shoulder of Mr Kenwigs dissolved in tears.

<P>`They are so beautiful!' said Mrs Kenwigs, sobbing.

<P>`Oh, dear,' said all the ladies, `so they are! it's very natural you
should feel proud of that; but don't give way, don't.'

<P>`I can--not help it, and it don't signify,' sobbed Mrs Kenwigs; `oh!
they're too beautiful to live, much too beautiful!'

<P>On hearing this alarming presentiment of their being doomed to an early
death in the flower of their infancy, all four little girls raised a hideous
cry, and burying their heads in their mother's lap simultaneously, screamed
until the eight flaxen tails vibrated again; Mrs Kenwigs meanwhile clasping
them alternately to her bosom, with attitudes expressive of distraction,
which Miss Petowker herself might have copied.

<P>At length, the anxious mother permitted herself to be soothed into a
more tranquil state, and the little Kenwigses, being also composed, were
distributed among the company, to prevent the possibility of Mrs Kenwigs
being again overcome by the blaze of their combined beauty. This done,
the ladies and gentlemen united in prophesying that they would live for
many, many years, and that there was no occasion at all for Mrs Kenwigs
to distress herself: which, in good truth, there did not appear to be;
the loveliness of the children by no means justifying her apprehensions.

<P>`This day eight year,' said Mr Kenwigs after a pause. `Dear me--ah!'

<P>This reflection was echoed by all present, who said `Ah!' first, and
`dear me,' afterwards.

<P>`I was younger then,' tittered Mrs Kenwigs.

<P>`No,' said the collector.

<P>`Certainly not,' added everybody.

<P>`I remember my niece,' said Mr Lillyvick, surveying his audience with
a grave air; `I remember her, on that very afternoon, when she first acknowledged
to her mother a partiality for Kenwigs. "Mother," she says, "I love him."'

<P>`"Adore him," I said, uncle,' interposed Mrs Kenwigs.

<P>`"Love him," I think, my dear,' said the collector, firmly.

<P>`Perhaps you are right, uncle,' replied Mrs Kenwigs, submissively. `I
thought it was "adore."'

<P>`"Love," my dear,' retorted Mr Lillyvick. `"Mother," she says, "I love
him!" "What do I hear?" cries her mother; and instantly falls into strong
conwulsions.'

<P>A general exclamation of astonishment burst from the company.

<P>`Into strong conwulsions,' repeated Mr Lillyvick, regarding them with
a rigid look. `Kenwigs will excuse my saying, in the presence of friends,
that there was a very great objection to him, on the ground that he was
beneath the family, and would disgrace it. You remember, Kenwigs?'

<P>`Certainly,' replied that gentleman, in no way displeased at the reminiscence,
inasmuch as it proved, beyond all doubt, what a high family Mrs Kenwigs
came of.

<P>`I shared in that feeling,' said Mr Lillyvick: `perhaps it was natural;
perhaps it wasn't.'

<P>A gentle murmur seemed to say, that, in one of Mr Lillyvick's station,
the objection was not only natural, but highly praiseworthy.

<P>`I came round to him in time,' said Mr Lillyvick. `After they were married,
and there was no help for it, I was one of the first to say that Kenwigs
must be taken notice of. The family <I>did</I> take notice of him, in consequence,
and on my representation; and I am bound to say--and proud to say--that
I have always found him a very honest, well-behaved, upright, respectable
sort of man. Kenwigs, shake hands.'

<P>`I am proud to do it, sir,' said Mr Kenwigs.

<P>`So am I, Kenwigs,' rejoined Mr Lillyvick.

<P>`A very happy life I have led with your niece, sir,' said Kenwigs.

<P>`It would have been your own fault if you had not, sir,' remarked Mr
Lillyvick.

<P>`Morleena Kenwigs,' cried her mother, at this crisis, much affected,
`kiss your dear uncle!'

<P>The young lady did as she was requested, and the three other little
girls were successively hoisted up to the collector's countenance, and
subjected to the same process, which was afterwards repeated on them by
the majority of those present.

<P>`Oh dear, Mrs Kenwigs,' said Miss Petowker, `while Mr Noggs is making
that punch to drink happy returns in, do let Morleena go through that figure
dance before Mr Lillyvick.'

<P>`No, no, my dear,' replied Mrs Kenwigs, `it will only worry my uncle.'

<P>`It can't worry him, I am sure,' said Miss Petowker. `You will be very
much pleased, won't you, sir?'

<P>`That I am sure I shall' replied the collector, glancing at the punchmixer.

<P>`Well then, I'll tell you what,' said Mrs Kenwigs, `Morleena shall do
the steps, if uncle can persuade Miss Petowker to recite us the Blood-Drinker's
Burial, afterwards.'

<P>There was a great clapping of hands and stamping of feet, at this proposition;
the subject whereof, gently inclined her head several times, in acknowledgment
of the reception.

<P>`You know,' said Miss Petowker, reproachfully, `that I dislike doing
anything professional in private parties.'

<P>`Oh, but not here!' said Mrs Kenwigs. `We are all so very friendly and
pleasant, that you might as well be going through it in your own room;
besides, the occasion--'

<P>`I can't resist that,' interrupted Miss Petowker; `anything in my humble
power I shall be delighted to do.'

<P>Mrs Kenwigs and Miss Petowker had arranged a small <I>programme</I>
of the entertainments between them, of which this was the prescribed order,
but they had settled to have a little pressing on both sides, because it
looked more natural. The company being all ready, Miss Petowker hummed
a tune, and Morleena danced a dance; having previously had the soles of
her shoes chalked, with as much care as if she were going on the tight-rope.
It was a very beautiful figure, comprising a great deal of work for the
arms, and was received with unbounded applause.

<P>`If I was blessed with a--a child--' said Miss Petowker, blushing, `of
such genius as that, I would have her out at the Opera instantly.'

<P>Mrs Kenwigs sighed, and looked at Mr Kenwigs, who shook his head, and
observed that he was doubtful about it.

<P>`Kenwigs is afraid,' said Mrs K.

<P>`What of?' inquired Miss Petowker, `not of her failing?'

<P>`Oh no,' replied Mrs Kenwigs, `but if she grew up what she is now,--only
think of the young dukes and marquises.'

<P>`Very right,' said the collector.

<P>`Still,' submitted Miss Petowker, `if she took a proper pride in herself,
you know--'

<P>`There's a good deal in that,' observed Mrs Kenwigs, looking at her
husband.

<P>`I only know--' faltered Miss Petowker,--`it may be no rule to be sure--but
<I>I</I> have never found any inconvenience or unpleasantness of that sort.'

<P>Mr Kenwigs, with becoming gallantry, said that settled the question
at once, and that he would take the subject into his serious consideration.
This being resolved upon, Miss Petowker was entreated to begin the Blood-Drinker's
Burial; to which end, that young lady let down her back hair, and taking
up her position at the other end of the room, with the bachelor friend
posted in a corner, to rush out at the cue `in death expire,' and catch
her in his arms when she died raving mad, went through the performance
with extraordinary spirit, and to the great terror of the little Kenwigses,
who were all but frightened into fits.

<P>The ecstasies consequent upon the effort had not yet subsided, and Newman
(who had not been thoroughly sober at so late an hour for a long long time,)
had not yet been able to put in a word of announcement, that the punch
was ready, when a hasty knock was heard at the room-door, which elicited
a shriek from Mrs Kenwigs, who immediately divined that the baby had fallen
out of bed.

<P>`Who is that?' demanded Mr Kenwigs, sharply.

<P>`Don't be alarmed, it's only me,' said Crowl, looking in, in his nightcap.
`The baby is very comfortable, for I peeped into the room as I came down,
and it's fast asleep, and so is the girl; and I don't think the candle
will set fire to the bed-curtain, unless a draught was to get into the
room--it's Mr Noggs that's wanted.'

<P>`Me!' cried Newman, much astonished.

<P>`Why, it <I>is</I> a queer hour, isn't it?' replied Crowl, who was not
best pleased at the prospect of losing his fire; `and they are queer-looking
people, too, all covered with rain and mud. Shall I tell them to go away?'

<P>`No,' said Newman, rising. `People? How many?'

<P>`Two,' rejoined Crowl.

<P>`Want me? By name?' asked Newman.

<P>`By name,' replied Crowl. `Mr Newman Noggs, as pat as need be.'

<P>Newman reflected for a few seconds, and then hurried away, muttering
that he would be back directly. He was as good as his word; for, in an
exceedingly short time, he burst into the room, and seizing, without a
word of apology or explanation, a lighted candle and tumbler of hot punch
from the table, darted away like a madman.

<P>`What the deuce is the matter with him?' exclaimed Crowl, throwing the
door open. `Hark! Is there any noise above?'

<P>The guests rose in great confusion, and, looking in each other's faces
with much perplexity and some fear, stretched their necks forward, and
listened attentively.
