<P>I<FONT SIZE=-1>T WAS</FONT> with a heavy heart, and many sad forebodings
which no effort could banish, that Kate Nickleby, on the morning appointed
for the commencement of her engagement with Madame Mantalini, left the
City when its clocks yet wanted a quarter of an hour of eight, and threaded
her way alone, amid the noise and bustle of the streets, towards the West-end
of London.

<P>At this early hour many sickly girls, whose business, like that of the
poor worm, is to produce, with patient toil, the finery that bedecks the
thoughtless and luxurious, traverse our streets, making towards the scene
of their daily labour, and catching, as if by stealth, in their hurried
walk, the only gasp of wholesome air and glimpse of sunlight which cheer
their monotonous existence during the long train of hours that make a working
day. As she drew night to the more fashionable quarter of the town, Kate
marked many of this class as they passed by, hurrying like herself to their
painful occupation, and saw, in their unhealthy looks and feeble gait,
but too clear an evidence that her misgivings were not wholly groundless.

<P>She arrived at Madame Mantalini's some minutes before the appointed
hour, and after walking a few times up and down, in the hope that some
other female might arrive and spare her the embarrassment of stating her
business to the servant, knocked timidly at the door: which, after some
delay, was opened by the footman, who had been putting on his striped jacket
as he came upstairs, and was now intent on fastening his apron.

<P>`Is Madame Mantalini in?' faltered Kate.

<P>`Not often out at this time, miss,' replied the man in a tone which
rendered "Miss," something more offensive than "My dear."

<P>`Can I see her?' asked Kate.

<P>`Eh?' replied the man, holding the door in his hand, and honouring the
inquirer with a stare and a broad grin, `Lord, no.'

<P>`I came by her own appointment,' said Kate; `I am--I am--to be employed
here.'

<P>`Oh! you should have rung the worker's bell,' said the footman, touching
the handle of one in the door-post. `Let me see, though, I forgot--Miss
Nickleby, is it?'

<P>`Yes,' replied Kate.

<P>`You're to walk upstairs then, please,' said the man. `Madame Mantalini
wants to see you--this way--take care of these things on the floor.'

<P>Cautioning her, in these terms, not to trip over a heterogeneous litter
of pastry-cook's trays, lamps, waiters full of glasses, and piles of rout
seats which were strewn about the hall, plainly bespeaking a late party
on the previous night, the man led the way to the second story, and ushered
Kate into a back-room, communicating by folding-doors with the apartment
in which she had first seen the mistress of the establishment.

<P>`If you'll wait here a minute,' said the man, `I'll tell her presently.'
Having made this promise with much affability, he retired and left Kate
alone.

<P>There was not much to amuse in the room; of which the most attractive
feature was, a half-length portrait in oil, of Mr Mantalini, whom the artist
had depicted scratching his head in an easy manner, and thus displaying
to advantage a diamond ring, the gift of Madame Mantalini before her marriage.
There was, however, the sound of voices in conversation in the next room;
and as the conversation was loud and the partition thin, Kate could not
help discovering that they belonged to Mr and Mrs Mantalini.

<P>`If you will be odiously, demnebly, outr<I>i</I>geously jealous, my
soul,' said Mr Mantalini, `you will be very miserable--horrid miserable--demnition
miserable.' And then, there was a sound as though Mr Mantalini were sipping
his coffee.

<P>`I <I>am</I> miserable,' returned Madame Mantalini, evidently pouting.

<P>`Then you are an ungrateful, unworthy, demd unthankful little fairy,'
said Mr Mantalini.

<P>`I am not,' returned Madame, with a sob.

<P>`Do not put itself out of humour,' said Mr Mantalini, breaking an egg.
`It is a pretty, bewitching little demd countenance, and it should not
be out of humour, for it spoils its loveliness, and makes it cross and
gloomy like a frightful, naughty, demd hobgoblin.'

<P>`I am not to be brought round in that way, always,' rejoined Madame,
sulkily.

<P>`It shall be brought round in any way it likes best, and not brought
round at all if it likes that better,' retorted Mr Mantalini, with his
eggspoon in his mouth.

<P>`It's very easy to talk,' said Mrs Mantalini.

<P>`Not so easy when one is eating a demnition egg,' replied Mr Mantalini;
`for the yolk runs down the waistcoat, and yolk of egg does not match any
waistcoat but a yellow waistcoat, demmit.'

<P>`You were flirting with her during the whole night,' said Madame Mantalini,
apparently desirous to lead the conversation back to the point from which
it had strayed.

<P>`No, no, my life.'

<P>`You were,' said Madame; `I had my eye upon you all the time.'

<P>`Bless the little winking twinkling eye; was it on me all the time!'
cried Mantalini, in a sort of lazy rapture. `Oh, demmit!'

<P>`And I say once more,' resumed Madame, `that you ought not to waltz
with anybody but your own wife; and I will not bear it, Mantalini, if I
take poison first.'

<P>`She will not take poison and have horrid pains, will she?' said Mantalini;
who, by the altered sound of his voice, seemed to have moved his chair,
and taken up his position nearer to his wife. `She will not take poison,
because she had a demd fine husband who might have married two countesses
and a dowager--'

<P>`Two countesses,' interposed Madame. `You told me one before!'

<P>`Two!' cried Mantalini. `Two demd fine women, real countesses and splendid
fortunes, demmit.'

<P>`And why didn't you?' asked Madame, playfully.

<P>`Why didn't I!' replied her husband. `Had I not seen, at a morning concert,
the demdest little fascinator in all the world, and while that little fascinator
is my wife, may not all the countesses and dowagers in England be--'

<P>Mr Mantalini did not finish the sentence, but he gave Madame Mantalini
a very loud kiss, which Madame Mantalini returned; after which, there seemed
to be some more kissing mixed up with the progress of the breakfast.

<P>`And what about the cash, my existence's jewel?' said Mantalini, when
these endearments ceased. `How much have we in hand?'

<P>`Very little indeed,' replied Madame.

<P>`We must have some more,' said Mantalini; `we must have some discount
out of old Nickleby to carry on the war with, demmit.'

<P>`You can't want any more just now,' said Madame coaxingly.

<P>`My life and soul,' returned her husband, `there is a horse for sale
at Scrubbs's, which it would be a sin and a crime to lose--going, my senses'
joy, for nothing.'

<P>`For nothing,' cried Madame, `I am glad of that.'

<P>`For actually nothing,' replied Mantalini. `A hundred guineas down will
buy him; mane, and crest, and legs, and tail, all of the demdest beauty.
I will ride him in the park before the very chariots of the rejected countesses.
The demd old dowager will faint with grief and rage; the other two will
say "He is married, he has made away with himself, it is a demd thing,
it is all up!" They will hate each other demnebly, and wish you dead and
buried. Ha! ha! Demmit.'

<P>Madame Mantalini's prudence, if she had any, was not proof against these
triumphal pictures; after a little jingling of keys, she observed that
she would see what her desk contained, and rising for that purpose, opened
the folding-door, and walked into the room where Kate was seated.

<P>`Dear me, child!' exclaimed Madame Mantalini, recoiling in surprise.
`How came you here?'

<P>`Child!' cried Mantalini, hurrying in. `How came--eh!--oh--demmit, how
d'ye do?'

<P>`I have been waiting, here some time, ma'am,' said Kate, addressing
Madame Mantalini. `The servant must have forgotten to let you know that
I was here, I think.'

<P>`You really must see to that man,' said Madame, turning to her husband.
`He forgets everything.'

<P>`I will twist his demd nose off his countenance for leaving such a very
pretty creature all alone by herself,' said her husband.

<P>`Mantalini,' cried Madame, `you forget yourself.'

<P>`I don't forget you, my soul, and never shall, and never can,' said
Mantalini, kissing his wife's hand, and grimacing aside, to Miss Nickleby,
who turned away.

<P>Appeased by this compliment, the lady of the business took some papers
from her desk which she handed over to Mr Mantalini, who received them
with great delight. She then requested Kate to follow her, and after several
feints on the part of Mr Mantalini to attract the young lady's attention,
they went away: leaving that gentleman extended at full length on the sofa,
with his heels in the air and a newspaper in his hand.

<P>Madame Mantalini led the way down a flight of stairs, and through a
passage, to a large room at the back of the premises where were a number
of young women employed in sewing, cutting out, making up, altering, and
various other processes known only to those who are cunning in the arts
of millinery and dressmaking. It was a close room with a skylight, and
as dull and quiet as a room need be.

<P>On Madame Mantalini calling aloud for Miss Knag, a short, bustling,
over-dressed female, full of importance, presented herself, and all the
young ladies suspending their operations for the moment, whispered to each
other sundry criticisms upon the make and texture of Miss Nickleby's dress,
her complexion, cast of features, and personal appearance, with as much
good breeding as could have been displayed by the very best society in
a crowded ball-room.

<P>`Oh, Miss Knag,' said Madame Mantalini, `this is the young person I
spoke to you about.'

<P>Miss Knag bestowed a reverential smile upon Madame Mantalini, which
she dexterously transformed into a gracious one for Kate, and said that
certainly, although it was a great deal of trouble to have young people
who were wholly unused to the business, still, she was sure the young person
would try to do her best--impressed with which conviction she (Miss Knag)
felt an interest in her, already.

<P>`I think that, for the present at all events, it will be better for
Miss Nickleby to come into the show-room with you, and try things on for
people,' said Madame Mantalini. `She will not be able for the present to
be of much use in any other way; and her appearance will--'

<P>`Suit very well with mine, Madame Mantalini,' interrupted Miss Knag.
`So it will; and to be sure I might have known that you would not be long
in finding that out; for you have so much taste in all those matters, that
really, as I often say to the young ladies, I do not know how, when, or
where, you possibly could have acquired all you know--hem--Miss Nickleby
and I are quite a pair, Madame Mantalini, only I am a little darker than
Miss Nickleby, and--hem--I think my foot may be a little darker than Miss
Nickleby, I am sure, will not be offended at my saying that, when she hears
that our family always have been celebrated for small feet ever since--hem--ever
since our family had any feet at all, indeed, I think. I had an uncle once,
Madame Mantalini, who lived in Cheltenham, and had a most excellent business
as a tobacconist--hem--who had such small feet, that they were no bigger
than those which are usually joined to wooden legs--the most symmetrical
feet, Madame Mantalini, that even you can imagine.'

<P>`They must have had something of the appearance of club feet, Miss Knag,'
said Madame.

<P>`Well now, that is so like you,' returned Miss Knag, `Ha! ha! ha! Of
club feet! Oh very good! As I often remark to the young ladies, "Well I
must say, and I do not care who knows it, of all the ready humour--hem--I
ever heard anywhere"--and I have heard a good deal; for when my dear brother
was alive (I kept house for him, Miss Nickleby), we had to supper once
a week two or three young men, highly celebrated in those days for their
humour, Madame Mantalini--"Of all the ready humour," I say to the young
ladies, "<I>I</I> ever heard, Madame Mantalini's is the most remarkable--hem.
It is so gentle, so sarcastic, and yet so good-natured (as I was observing
to Miss Simmonds only this morning), that how, or when, or by what means
she acquired it, is to me a mystery indeed."'

<P>Here Miss Knag paused to take breath, and while she pauses it may be
observed--not that she was marvellously loquacious and marvellously deferential
to Madame Mantalini, since these are facts which require no comment; but
that every now and then, she was accustomed, in the torrent of her discourse,
to introduce a loud, shrill, clear `hem!' the import and meaning of which,
was variously interpreted by her acquaintance; some holding that Miss Knag
dealt in exaggeration, and introduced the monosyllable when any fresh invention
was in course of coinage in her brain; others, that when she wanted a word,
she threw it in to gain time, and prevent anybody else from striking into
the conversation. It may be further remarked, that Miss Knag still aimed
at youth, although she had shot beyond it, years ago; and that she was
weak and vain, and one of those people who are best described by the axiom,
that you may trust them as far as you can see them, and no farther.

<P>`You'll take care that Miss Nickleby understands her hours, and so forth,'
said Madame Mantalini; `and so I'll leave her with you. You'll not forget
my directions, Miss Knag?'

<P>Miss Knag of course replied, that to forget anything Madame Mantalini
had directed, was a moral impossibility; and that lady, dispensing a general
good-morning among her assistants, sailed away.

<P>`Charming creature, isn't she, Miss Nickleby?' said Miss Knag, rubbing
her hands together.

<P>`I have seen very little of her,' said Kate. `I hardly know yet.'

<P>`Have you seen Mr Mantalini?' inquired Miss Knag.

<P>`Yes; I have seen him twice.'

<P>`Isn't <I>be</I> a charming creature?'

<P>`Indeed he does not strike me as being so, by any means,' replied Kate.

<P>`No, my dear!' cried Miss Knag, elevating her hands. `Why, goodness
gracious mercy, where's your taste? Such a fine tall, full-whiskered dashing
gentlemanly man, with such teeth and hair, and--hem--well now, you <I>do</I>
astonish me.'

<P>`I dare say I am very foolish,' replied Kate, laying aside her bonnet;
`but as my opinion is of very little importance to him or anyone else,
I do not regret having formed it, and shall be slow to change it, I think.'

<P>`He is a very fine man, don't you think so?' asked one of the young
ladies.

<P>`Indeed he may be, for anything I could say to the contrary,' replied
Kate.

<P>`And drives very beautiful horses, doesn't he?' inquired another.

<P>`I dare say he may, but I never saw them,' answered Kate.

<P>`Never saw them!' interposed Miss Knag. `Oh, well! There it is at once
you know; how can you possibly pronounce an opinion about a gentleman--hem--if
you don't see him as he turns out altogether?'

<P>There was so much of the world--even of the little world of the country
girl--in this idea of the old milliner, that Kate, who was anxious, for
every reason, to change the subject, made no further remark, and left Miss
Knag in possession of the field.

<P>After a short silence, during which most of the young people made a
closer inspection of Kate's appearance, and compared notes respecting it,
one of them offered to help her off with her shawl, and the offer being
accepted, inquired whether she did not find black very uncomfortable wear.

<P>`I do indeed,' replied Kate, with a bitter sigh.

<P>`So dusty and hot,' observed the same speaker, adjusting her dress for
her.

<P>Kate might have said, that mourning is sometimes the coldest wear which
mortals can assume; that it not only chills the breasts of those it clothes,
but extending its influence to summer friends, freezes up their sources
of good-will and kindness, and withering all the buds of promise they once
so liberally put forth, leaves nothing but bared and rotten hearts exposed.
There are few who have lost a friend or relative constituting in life their
sole dependence, who have not keenly felt this chilling influence of their
sable garb. She had felt it acutely, and feeling it at the moment, could
not quite restrain her tears.

<P>`I am very sorry to have wounded you by my thoughtless speech,' said
her companion. `I did not think of it. You are in mourning for some near
relation?'

<P>`For my father,' answered Kate.

<P>`For what relation, Miss Simmonds?' asked Miss Knag, in an audible voice.

<P>`Her father,' replied the other softly.

<P>`Her father, eh?' said Miss Knag, without the slightest depression of
her voice. `Ah! A long illness, Miss Simmonds?'

<P>`Hush,' replied the girl; `I don't know.'

<P>`Our misfortune was very sudden,' said Kate, turning away, `or I might
perhaps, at a time like this, be enabled to support it better.'

<P>There had existed not a little desire in the room, according to invariable
custom, when any new `young person' came, to know who Kate was, and what
she was, and all about her; but, although it might have been very naturally
increased by her appearance and emotion, the knowledge that it pained her
to be questioned, was sufficient to repress even this curiosity; and Miss
Knag, finding it hopeless to attempt extracting any further particulars
just then, reluctantly commanded silence, and bade the work proceed.

<P>In silence, then, the tasks were plied until half-past one, when a baked
leg of mutton, with potatoes to correspond, were served in the kitchen.
The meal over, and the young ladies having enjoyed the additional relaxation
of washing their hands, the work began again, and was again performed in
silence, until the noise of carriages rattling through the streets, and
of loud double knocks at doors, gave token that the day's work of the more
fortunate members of society was proceeding in its turn.

<P>One of these double knocks at Madame Mantalini's door, announced the
equipage of some great lady--or rather rich one, for there is occasionally
a distinction between riches and greatness--who had come with her daughter
to approve of some court-dresses which had been a long time preparing,
and upon whom Kate was deputed to wait, accompanied by Miss Knag, and officered
of course by Madame Mantalini.

<P>Kate's part in the pageant was humble enough, her duties being limited
to holding articles of costume until Miss Knag was ready to try them on,
and now and then tying a string, or fastening a hook-and-eye. She might,
not unreasonably, have supposed herself beneath the reach of any arrogance,
or bad humour; but it happened that the lady and daughter were both out
of temper that day, and the poor girl came in for her share of their revilings.
She was awkward--her hands were cold--dirty--coarse--she could do nothing
right; they wondered how Madame Mantalini could have such people about
her; requested they might see some other young woman the next time they
came; and so forth.

<P>So common an occurrence would be hardly deserving of mention, but for
its effect. Kate shed many bitter tears when these people were gone, and
felt, for the first time, humbled by her occupation. She had, it is true,
quailed at the prospect of drudgery and hard service; but she had felt
no degradation in working for her bread, until she found herself exposed
to insolence and pride. Philosophy would have taught her that the degradation
was on the side of those who had sunk so low as to display such passions
habitually, and without cause: but she was too young for such consolation,
and her honest feeling was hurt. May not the complaint, that common people
are above their station, often take its rise in the fact of <I>un</I>common
people being below theirs?

<P>In such scenes and occupations the time wore on until nine o'clock,
when Kate, jaded and dispirited with the occurrences of the day, hastened
from the confinement of the workroom, to join her mother at the street
corner, and walk home:--the more sadly, from having to disguise her real
feelings, and feign to participate in all the sanguine visions of her companion.

<P>`Bless my soul, Kate,' said Mrs Nickleby; `I've been thinking all day
what a delightful thing it would be for Madame Mantalini to take you into
partnership--such a likely thing too, you know! Why, your poor dear pap's
cousin's sister-in-law--a Miss Browndock--was taken into partnership by
a lady that kept a school at Hammersmith, and made her fortune in no time
at all. I forget, by-the-bye, whether that Miss Browndock was the same
lady that got the ten thousand pounds prize in the lottery, but I think
she was; indeed, now I come to think of it, I am sure she was. "Mantalini
and Nickleby", how well it would sound!--and if Nicholas has any good fortune,
you might have Doctor Nickleby, the head-master of Westminster School,
living in the same street.'

<P>`Dear Nicholas!' cried Kate, taking from her reticule her brother's
letter from Dotheboys Hall. `In all our misfortunes, how happy it makes
me, mamma, to hear he is doing well, and to find him writing in such good
spirits! It consoles me for all we may undergo, to think that he is comfortable
and happy.'

<P>Poor Kate! she little thought how weak her consolation was, and how
soon she would be undeceived.
