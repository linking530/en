CHAPTER XXXV</H1></CENTER>

<CENTER><I>Smike becomes known to Mrs Nickleby and Kate. Nicholas also
meets with new acquaintances. Brighter days seem to dawn upon the family</I></CENTER>


<P>H<FONT SIZE=-1>AVING ESTABLISHED</FONT> his mother and sister in the
apartments of the kind-hearted miniature painter, and ascertained that
Sir Mulberry Hawk was in no danger of losing his life, Nicholas turned
his thoughts to poor Smike, who, after breakfasting with Newman Noggs,
had remained, in a disconsolate state, at that worthy creature's lodgings,
waiting, with much anxiety, for further intelligence of his protector.

<P>`As he will be one of our own little household, wherever we live, or
whatever fortune is in reserve for us,' thought Nicholas, `I must present
the poor fellow in due form. They will be kind to him for his own sake,
and if not (on that account solely) to the full extent I could wish, they
will stretch a point, I am sure, for mine.'

<P>Nicholas said `they', but his misgivings were confined to one person.
He was sure of Kate, but he knew his mother's peculiarities, and was not
quite so certain that Smike would find favour in the eyes of Mrs Nickleby.

<P>`However,' thought Nicholas as he departed on his benevolent errand;
`she cannot fail to become attached to him, when she knows what a devoted
creature he is, and as she must quickly make the discovery, his probation
will be a short one.'

<P>`I was afraid,' said Smike, overjoyed to see his friend again, `that
you had fallen into some fresh trouble; the time seemed so long, at last,
that I almost feared you were lost.'

<P>`Lost!' replied Nicholas gaily. `You will not be rid of me so easily,
I promise you. I shall rise to the surface many thousand times yet, and
the harder the thrust that pushes me down, the more quickly I shall rebound,
Smike. But come; my errand here is to take you home.'

<P>`Home!' faltered Smike, drawing timidly back.

<P>`Ay,' rejoined Nicholas, taking his arm. `Why not?'

<P>`I had such hopes once,' said Smike; `day and night, day and night,
for many years. I longed for home till I was weary, and pined away with
grief, but now--'

<P>`And what now?' asked Nicholas, looking kindly in his face. `What now,
old friend?'

<P>`I could not part from you to go to any home on earth,' replied Smike,
pressing his hand; `except one, except one. I shall never be an old man;
and if your hand placed me in the grave, and I could think, before I died,
that you would come and look upon it sometimes with one of your kind smiles,
and in the summer weather, when everything was alive -- not dead like me
-- I could go to that home almost without a tear.'

<P>`Why do you talk thus, poor boy, if your life is a happy one with me?'
said Nicholas.

<P>`Because <I>I</I> should change; not those about me. And if they forgot
me, <I>I</I> should never know it,' replied Smike. `In the churchyard we
are all alike, but here there are none like me. I am a poor creature, but
I know that.'

<P>`You are a foolish, silly creature,' said Nicholas cheerfully. `If that
is what you mean, I grant you that. Why, here's a dismal face for ladies'
company! -- my pretty sister too, whom you have so often asked me about.
Is this your Yorkshire gallantry? For shame! for shame!'

<P>Smike brightened up and smiled.

<P>`When I talk of home,' pursued Nicholas, `I talk of mine -- which is
yours of course. If it were defined by any particular four walls and a
roof, God knows I should be sufficiently puzzled to say whereabouts it
lay; but that is not what I mean. When I speak of home, I speak of the
place where -- in default of a better -- those I love are gathered together;
and if that place were a gypsy's tent, or a barn, I should call it by the
same good name notwithstanding. And now, for what is my present home, which,
however alarming your expectations may be, will neither terrify you by
its extent nor its magnificence.'

<P>So saying, Nicholas took his companion by the arm, and saying a great
deal more to the same purpose, and pointing out various things to amuse
and interest him as they went along, led the way to Miss La Creevy's house.

<P>`And this, Kate,' said Nicholas, entering the room where his sister
sat alone, `is the faithful friend and affectionate fellow-traveller whom
I prepared you to receive.'

<P>Poor Smike was bashful, and awkward, and frightened enough, at first,
but Kate advanced towards him so kindly, and said, in such a sweet voice,
how anxious she had been to see him after all her brother had told her,
and how much she had to thank him for having comforted Nicholas so greatly
in their very trying reverses, that he began to be very doubtful whether
he should shed tears or not, and became still more flurried. However, he
managed to say, in a broken voice, that Nicholas was his only friend, and
that he would lay down his life to help him; and Kate, although she was
so kind and considerate, seemed to be so wholly unconscious of his distress
and embarrassment, that he recovered almost immediately and felt quite
at home.

<P>Then, Miss La Creevy came in; and to her Smike had to be presented also.
And Miss La Creevy was very kind too, and wonderfully talkative: -- not
to Smike, for that would have made him uneasy at first, but to Nicholas
and his sister. Then, after a time, she would speak to Smike himself now
and then, asking him whether he was a judge of likenesses, and whether
he thought that picture in the corner was like herself, and whether he
didn't think it would have looked better if she had made herself ten years
younger, and whether he didn't think, as a matter of general observation,
that young ladies looked better not only in pictures, but out of them too,
than old ones; with many more small jokes and facetious remarks, which
were delivered with such good-humour and merriment, that Smike thought,
within himself, she was the nicest lady he had ever seen; even nicer than
Mrs Grudden, of Mr Vincent Crummles's theatre; and she was a nice lady
too, and talked, perhaps more, but certainly louder, than Miss La Creevy.

<P>At length the door opened again, and a lady in mourning came in; and
Nicholas kissing the lady in mourning affectionately, and calling her his
mother, led her towards the chair from which Smike had risen when she entered
the room.

<P>`You are always kind-hearted, and anxious to help the oppressed, my
dear mother,' said Nicholas, `so you will be favourably disposed towards
him, I know.'

<P>`I am sure, my dear Nicholas,' replied Mrs Nickleby, looking very hard
at her new friend, and bending to him with something more of majesty than
the occasion seemed to require, -- `I am sure any friend of yours has,
as indeed he naturally ought to have, and must have, of course, you know
-- a great claim upon me, and of course, it is a very great pleasure to
me to be introduced to anybody you take an interest in -- there can he
no doubt about that; none at all; not the least in the world,' said Mrs
Nickleby. `At the same time I must say, Nicholas, my dear, as I used to
say to your poor dear papa, when he <I>would</I> bring gentlemen home to
dinner, and there was nothing in the house, that if he had come the day
before yesterday -- no, I don't mean the day before yesterday now; I should
have said, perhaps, the year before last -- we should have been better
able to entertain him.'

<P>With which remarks, Mrs Nickleby turned to her daughter, and inquired,
in an audible whisper, whether the gentleman was going to stop all night.

<P>`Because, if he is, Kate, my dear,' said Mrs Nickleby, `I don't see
that it's possible for him to sleep anywhere, and that's the truth.'

<P>Kate stepped gracefully forward, and without any show of annoyance or
irritation, breathed a few words into her mother's ear.

<P>`La, Kate, my dear,' said Mrs Nickleby, shrinking back, `how you do
tickle one! Of course, I understand <I>that</I>, my love, without your
telling me; and I said the same to Nicholas, and I <I>am</I> very much
pleased. You didn't tell me, Nicholas, my dear,' added Mrs Nickleby, turning
round with an air of less reserve than she had before assumed, `what your
friend's name is.'

<P>`His name, mother,' replied Nicholas, `is Smike.'

<P>The effect of this communication was by no means anticipated; but the
name was no sooner pronounced, than Mrs Nickleby dropped upon a chair,
and burst into a fit of crying.

<P>`What is the matter?' exclaimed Nicholas, running to support her.

<P>`It's so like Pyke,' cried Mrs Nickleby; `so exactly like Pyke. Oh!
don't speak to me -- I shall be better presently.'

<P>And after exhibiting every symptom of slow suffocation in all its stages,
and drinking about a tea-spoonful of water from a full tumbler, and spilling
the remainder, Mrs Nickleby <I>was</I> better, and remarked, with a feeble
smile, that she was very foolish, she knew.

<P>`It's a weakness in our family,' said Mrs Nickleby, `so, of course,
I can't be blamed for it. Your grandmamma, Kate, was exactly the same --
precisely. The least excitement, the slightest surprise, she fainted away
directly. I have heard her say, often and often, that when she was a young
lady, and before she was married, she was turning a corner into Oxford
Street one day, when she ran against her own hairdresser, who, it seems,
was escaping from a bear; -- the mere suddenness of the encounter made
her faint away directly. Wait, though,' added Mrs Nickleby, pausing to
consider. `Let me be sure I'm right. Was it her hairdresser who had escaped
from a bear, or was it a bear who had escaped from her hairdresser's? I
declare I can't remember just now, but the hairdresser was a very handsome
man, I know, and quite a gentleman in his manners; so that it has nothing
to do with the point of the story.'

<P>Mrs Nickleby having fallen imperceptibly into one of her retrospective
moods, improved in temper from that moment, and glided, by an easy change
of the conversation occasionally, into various other anecdotes, no less
remarkable for their strict application to the subject in hand.

<P>`Mr Smike is from Yorkshire, Nicholas, my dear?' said Mrs Nickleby,
after dinner, and when she had been silent for some time.

<P>`Certainly, mother,' replied Nicholas. `I see you have not forgotten
his melancholy history.'

<P>`O dear no,' cried Mrs Nickleby. `Ah! melancholy, indeed. You don't
happen, Mr Smike, ever to have dined with the Grimbles of Grimble Hall,
somewhere in the North Riding, do you?' said the good lady, addressing
herself to him. `A very proud man, Sir Thomas Grimble, with six grown-up
and most lovely daughters, and the finest park in the county.'

<P>`My dear mother,' reasoned Nicholas, `do you suppose that the unfortunate
outcast of a Yorkshire school was likely to receive many cards of invitation
from the nobility and gentry in the neighbourhood?'

<P>`Really, my dear, I don't know why it should be so very extraordinary,'
said Mrs Nickleby. `I know that when I was at school, I always went at
least twice every half-year to the Hawkinses at Taunton Vale, and they
are much richer than the Grimbles, and connected with them in marriage;
so you see it's not so very unlikely, after all.'

<P>Having put down Nicholas in this triumphant manner, Mrs Nickleby was
suddenly seized with a forgetfulness of Smike's real name, and an irresistible
tendency to call him Mr Slammons; which circumstance she attributed to
the remarkable similarity of the two names in point of sound both beginning
with an S, and moreover being spelt with an M. But whatever doubt there
might be on this point, there was none as to his being a most excellent
listener; which circumstance had considerable influence in placing them
on the very best terms, and inducing Mrs Nickleby to express the highest
opinion of his general deportment and disposition.

<P>Thus, the little circle remained, on the most amicable and agreeable
footing, until the Monday morning, when Nicholas withdrew himself from
it for a short time, seriously to reflect upon the state of his affairs,
and to determine, if he could, upon some course of life, which would enable
him to support those who were so entirely dependent upon his exertions.

<P>Mr Crummles occurred to him more than once; but although Kate was acquainted
with the whole history of his connection with that gentleman, his mother
was not; and he foresaw a thousand fretful objections, on her part, to
his seeking a livelihood upon the stage. There were graver reasons, too,
against his returning to that mode of life. Independently of those arising
out of its spare and precarious earnings, and his own internal conviction
that he could never hope to aspire to any great distinction, even as a
provincial actor, how could he carry his sister from town to town, and
place to place, and debar her from any other associates than those with
whom he would be compelled, almost without distinction, to mingle? `It
won't do,' said Nicholas, shaking his head; `I must try something else.'

<P>It was much easier to make this resolution than to carry it into effect.
With no greater experience of the world than he had acquired for himself
in his short trials; with a sufficient share of headlong rashness and precipitation
(qualities not altogether unnatural at his time of life); with a very slender
stock of money, and a still more scanty stock of friends; what could he
do? `Egad!' said Nicholas, `I'll try that Register Office again.'

<P>He smiled at himself as he walked away with a quick step; for, an instant
before, he had been internally blaming his own precipitation. He did not
laugh himself out of the intention, however, for on he went: picturing
to himself, as he approached the place, all kinds of splendid possibilities,
and impossibilities too, for that matter, and thinking himself, perhaps
with good reason, very fortunate to be endowed with so buoyant and sanguine
a temperament.

<P>The office looked just the same as when he had left it last, and, indeed,
with one or two exceptions, there seemed to be the very same placards in
the window that he had seen before. There were the same unimpeachable masters
and mistresses in want of virtuous servants, and the same virtuous servants
in want of unimpeachable masters and mistresses, and the same magnificent
estates for the investment of capital, and the same enormous quantities
of capital to be invested in estates, and, in short, the same opportunities
of all sorts for people who wanted to make their fortunes. And a most extraordinary
proof it was of the national prosperity, that people had not been found
to avail themselves of such advantages long ago.

<P>As Nicholas stopped to look in at the window, an old gentleman happened
to stop too; and Nicholas, carrying his eye along the window-panes from
left to right in search of some capital-text placard which should be applicable
to his own case, caught sight of this old gentleman's figure, and instinctively
withdrew his eyes from the window, to observe the same more closely.

<P>He was a sturdy old fellow in a broad-skirted blue coat, made pretty
large, to fit easily, and with no particular waist; his bulky legs clothed
in drab breeches and high gaiters, and his head protected by a low-crowned
broad-brimmed white hat, such as a wealthy grazier might wear. He wore
his coat buttoned; and his dimpled double chin rested in the folds of a
white neckerchief -- not one of your stiff-starched apoplectic cravats,
but a good, easy, old-fashioned white neckcloth that a man might go to
bed in and be none the worse for. But what principally attracted the attention
of Nicholas was the old gentleman's eye, -- never was such a clear, twinkling,
honest, merry, happy eye, as that. And there he stood, looking a little
upward, with one hand thrust into the breast of his coat, and the other
playing with his old-fashioned gold watch-chain: his head thrown a little
on one side, and his hat a little more on one side than his head, (but
that was evidently accident; not his ordinary way of wearing it,) with
such a pleasant smile playing about his mouth, and such a comical expression
of mingled slyness, simplicity, kind-heartedness, and good-humour, lighting
up his jolly old face, that Nicholas would have been content to have stood
there and looked at him until evening, and to have forgotten, meanwhile,
that there was such a thing as a soured mind or a crabbed countenance to
be met with in the whole wide world.

<P>But, even a very remote approach to this gratification was not to be
made, for although he seemed quite unconscious of having been the subject
of observation, he looked casually at Nicholas; and the latter, fearful
of giving offence, resumed his scrutiny of the window instantly.

<P>Still, the old gentleman stood there, glancing from placard to placard,
and Nicholas could not forbear raising his eyes to his face again. Grafted
upon the quaintness and oddity of his appearance, was something so indescribably
engaging, and bespeaking so much worth, and there were so many little lights
hovering about the corners of his mouth and eyes, that it was not a mere
amusement, but a positive pleasure and delight to look at him.

<P>This being the case, it is no wonder that the old man caught Nicholas
in the fact, more than once. At such times, Nicholas coloured and looked
embarrassed: for the truth is, that he had begun to wonder whether the
stranger could, by any possibility, be looking for a clerk or secretary;
and thinking this, he felt as if the old gentleman must know it.

<P>Long as all this takes to tell, it was not more than a couple of minutes
in passing. As the stranger was moving away, Nicholas caught his eye again,
and, in the awkwardness of the moment, stammered out an apology.

<P>`No offence -- oh no offence!' said the old man.

<P>This was said in such a hearty tone, and the voice was so exactly what
it should have been from such a speaker, and there was such a cordiality
in the manner, that Nicholas was emboldened to speak again.

<P>`A great many opportunities here, sir,' he said, half smiling as he
motioned towards the window.

<P>`A great many people willing and anxious to be employed have seriously
thought so very often, I dare say,' replied the old man. `Poor fellows,
poor fellows!'

<P>He moved away as he said this; but seeing that Nicholas was about to
speak, good-naturedly slackened his pace, as if he were unwilling to cut
him short. After a little of that hesitation which may be sometimes observed
between two people in the street who have exchanged a nod, and are both
uncertain whether they shall turn back and speak, or not, Nicholas found
himself at the old man's side.

<P>`You were about to speak, young gentleman; what were you going to say?'

<P>`Merely that I almost hoped -- I mean to say, thought -- you had some
object in consulting those advertisements,' said Nicholas.

<P>`Ay, ay? what object now -- what object?' returned the old man, looking
slily at Nicholas. `Did you think I wanted a situation now -- eh? Did you
think I did?'

<P>Nicholas shook his head.

<P>`Ha! ha!' laughed the old gentleman, rubbing his hands and wrists as
if he were washing them. `A very natural thought, at all events, after
seeing me gazing at those bills. I thought the same of you, at first; upon
my word I did.'

<P>`If you had thought so at last, too, sir, you would not have been far
from the truth,' rejoined Nicholas.

<P>`Eh?' cried the old man, surveying him from head to foot. `What! Dear
me! No, no. Well-behaved young gentleman reduced to such a necessity! No
no, no no.'

<P>Nicholas bowed, and bidding him good-morning, turned upon his heel.

<P>`Stay,' said the old man, beckoning him into a by-street, where they
could converse with less interruption. `What d'ye mean, eh?'

<P>`Merely that your kind face and manner -- both so unlike any I have
ever seen -- tempted me into an avowal, which, to any other stranger in
this wilderness of London, I should not have dreamt of making,' returned
Nicholas.

<P>`Wilderness! Yes, it is, it is. Good! It <I>is</I> a wilderness,' said
the old man with much animation. `It was a wilderness to me once. I came
here barefoot -- I have never forgotten it. Thank God!' and he raised his
hat from his head, and looked very grave.

<P>`What's the matter -- what is it -- how did it all come about?' said
the old man, laying his hand on the shoulder of Nicholas, and walking him
up the street. `You're -- Eh?' laying his finger on the sleeve of his black
coat. `Who's it for -- eh?'

<P>`My father,' replied Nicholas.

<P>`Ah!' said the old gentleman quickly. `Bad thing for a young man to
lose his father. Widowed mother, perhaps?'

<P>Nicholas sighed.

<P>`Brothers and sisters too -- eh?'

<P>`One sister,' rejoined Nicholas.

<P>`Poor thing, poor thing! You are a scholar too, I dare say?' said the
old man, looking wistfully into the face of the young one.

<P>`I have been tolerably well educated,' said Nicholas.

<P>`Fine thing,' said the old gentleman, `education a great thing -- a
very great thing -- I never had any. I admire it the more in others. A
very fine thing -- yes, yes. Tell me more of your history. Let me hear
it all. No impertinent curiosity -- no, no, no.'

<P>There was something so earnest and guileless in the way in which all
this was said, and such a complete disregard of all conventional restraints
and coldnesses, that Nicholas could not resist it. Among men who have any
sound and sterling qualities, there is nothing so contagious as pure openness
of heart. Nicholas took the infection instantly, and ran over the main
points of his little history without reserve: merely suppressing names,
and touching as lightly as possible upon his uncle's treatment of Kate.
The old man listened with great attention, and when he had concluded, drew
his arm eagerly through his own.

<P>`Don't say another word -- not another word' said he. `Come along with
me. We mustn't lose a minute.'

<P>So saying, the old gentleman dragged him back into Oxford Street, and
hailing an omnibus on its way to the City, pushed Nicholas in before him,
and followed himself.

<P>As he appeared in a most extraordinary condition of restless excitement,
and whenever Nicholas offered to speak, immediately interposed with --
`Don't say another word, my dear sir, on any account -- not another word,'
the young man thought it better to attempt no further interruption. Into
the City they journeyed accordingly, without interchanging any conversation;
and the farther they went, the more Nicholas wondered what the end of the
adventure could possibly be.

<P>The old gentleman got out, with great alacrity, when they reached the
Bank, and once more taking Nicholas by the arm, hurried him along Threadneedle
Street, and through some lanes and passages on the right, until they, at
length, emerged in a quiet shady little square. Into the oldest and cleanest-looking
house of business in the square, he led the way. The only inscription on
the door-post was `Cheeryble, Brothers;' but from a hasty glance at the
directions of some packages which were lying about, Nicholas supposed that
the brothers Cheeryble were German merchants.

<P>Passing through a warehouse which presented every indication of a thriving
business, Mr Cheeryble (for such Nicholas supposed him to be, from the
respect which had been shown him by the warehousemen and porters whom they
passed) led him into a little partitioned-off counting-house like a large
glass case, in which counting-house there sat -- as free from dust and
blemish as if he had been fixed into the glass case before the top was
put on, and had never come out since -- a fat, elderly, large-faced clerk,
with silver spectacles and a powdered head.

<P>`Is my brother in his room, Tim?' said Mr Cheeryble, with no less kindness
of manner than he had shown to Nicholas.

<P>`Yes, he is, sir,' replied the fat clerk, turning his spectacle-glasses
towards his principal, and his eyes towards Nicholas, `but Mr Trimmers
is with him.'

<P>`Ay! And what has he come about, Tim?' said Mr Cheeryble.

<P>`He is getting up a subscription for the widow and family of a man who
was killed in the East India Docks this morning, sir,' rejoined Tim. `Smashed,
sir, by a cask of sugar.'

<P>`He is a good creature,' said Mr Cheeryble, with great earnestness.
`He is a kind soul. I am very much obliged to Trimmers. Trimmers is one
of the best friends we have. He makes a thousand cases known to us that
we should never discover of ourselves. I am <I>very</I> much obliged to
Trimmers.' Saying which, Mr Cheeryble rubbed his hands with infinite delight,
and Mr Trimmers happening to pass the door that instant, on his way out,
shot out after him and caught him by the hand.

<P>`I owe you a thousand thanks, Trimmers -- ten thousand thanks -- I take
it very friendly of you -- very friendly indeed,' said Mr Cheeryble, dragging
him into a corner to get out of hearing. `How many children are there,
and what has my brother Ned given, Trimmers?'

<P>`There are six children,' replied the gentleman, `and your brother has
given us twenty pounds.'

<P>`My brother Ned is a good fellow, and you're a good fellow too, Trimmers,'
said the old man, shaking him by both hands with trembling eagerness. `Put
me down for another twenty -- or -- stop a minute, stop a minute. We mustn't
look ostentatious; put me down ten pound, and Tim Linkinwater ten pound.
A cheque for twenty pound for Mr Trimmers, Tim. God bless you, Trimmers
-- and come and dine with us some day this week; you'll always find a knife
and fork, and we shall be delighted. Now, my dear sir -- cheque from Mr
Linkinwater, Tim. Smashed by a cask of sugar, and six poor children --
oh dear, dear, dear!'

<P>Talking on in this strain, as fast as he could, to prevent any friendly
remonstrances from the collector of the subscription on the large amount
of his donation, Mr Cheeryble led Nicholas, equally astonished and affected
by what he had seen and heard in this short space, to the half-opened door
of another room.

<P>`Brother Ned,' said Mr Cheeryble, tapping with his knuckles, and stooping
to listen, `are you busy, my dear brother, or can you spare time for a
word or two with me?'

<P>`Brother Charles, my dear fellow,' replied a voice from the inside,
so like in its tones to that which had just spoken, that Nicholas started,
and almost thought it was the same, `don't ask me such a question, but
come in directly.'

<P>They went in, without further parley. What was the amazement of Nicholas
when his conductor advanced, and exchanged a warm greeting with another
old gentleman, the very type and model of himself -- the same face, the
same figure, the same coat, waistcoat, and neckcloth, the same breeches
and gaiters -- nay, there was the very same white hat hanging against the
wall!

<P>As they shook each other by the hand: the face of each lighted up by
beaming looks of affection, which would have been most delightful to behold
in infants, and which, in men so old, was inexpressibly touching: Nicholas
could observe that the last old gentleman was something stouter than his
brother; this, and a slight additional shade of clumsiness in his gait
and stature, formed the only perceptible difference between them. Nobody
could have doubted their being twin brothers.

<P>`Brother Ned,' said Nicholas's friend, closing the room-door, `here
is a young friend of mine whom we must assist. We must make proper inquiries
into his statements, in justice to him as well as to ourselves, and if
they are confirmed -- as I feel assured they will be -- we must assist
him, we must assist him, brother Ned.'

<P>`It is enough, my dear brother, that you say we should,' returned the
other. `When you say that, no further inquiries are needed. He <I>shall</I>
be assisted. What are his necessities, and what does he require? Where
is Tim Linkinwater? Let us have him here.'

<P>Both the brothers, it may be here remarked, had a very emphatic and
earnest delivery; both had lost nearly the same teeth, which imparted the
same peculiarity to their speech; and both spoke as if, besides possessing
the utmost serenity of mind that the kindliest and most unsuspecting nature
could bestow, they had, in collecting the plums from Fortune's choicest
pudding, retained a few for present use, and kept them in their mouths.

<P>`Where is Tim Linkinwater?' said brother Ned.

<P>`Stop, stop, stop!' said brother Charles, taking the other aside. `I've
a plan, my dear brother, I've a plan. Tim is getting old, and Tim has been
a faithful servant, brother Ned; and I don't think pensioning Tim's mother
and sister, and buying a little tomb for the family when his poor brother
died, was a sufficient recompense for his faithful services.'

<P>`No, no, no,' replied the other. `Certainly not. Not half enough, not
half.'

<P>`If we could lighten Tim's duties,' said the old gentleman, `and prevail
upon him to go into the country, now and then, and sleep in the fresh air,
besides, two or three times a week (which he could, if he began business
an hour later in the morning), old Tim Linkinwater would grow young again
in time; and he's three good years our senior now. Old Tim Linkinwater
young again! Eh, brother Ned, eh? Why, I recollect old Tim Linkinwater
quite a little boy, don't you? Ha, ha, ha! Poor Tim, poor Tim!'

<P>And the fine old fellows laughed pleasantly together: each with a tear
of regard for old Tim Linkinwater standing in his eye.

<P>`But hear this first -- hear this first, brother Ned,' said the old
man, hastily, placing two chairs, one on each side of Nicholas: `I'll tell
it you myself, brother Ned, because the young gentleman is modest, and
is a scholar, Ned, and I shouldn't feel it right that he should tell us
his story over and over again as if he was a beggar, or as if we doubted
him. No, no no.'

<P>`No, no, no,' returned the other, nodding his head gravely. `Very right,
my dear brother, very right.'

<P>`He will tell me I'm wrong, if I make a mistake,' said Nicholas's friend.
`But whether I do or not, you'll be very much affected, brother Ned, remembering
the time when we were two friendless lads, and earned our first shilling
in this great city.'

<P>The twins pressed each other's hands in silence; and in his own homely
manner, brother Charles related the particulars he had heard from Nicholas.
The conversation which ensued was a long one, and when it was over, a secret
conference of almost equal duration took place between brother Ned and
Tim Linkinwater in another room. It is no disparagement to Nicholas to
say, that before he had been closeted with the two brothers ten minutes,
he could only wave his hand at every fresh expression of kindness and sympathy,
and sob like a little child.

<P>At length brother Ned and Tim Linkinwater came back together, when Tim
instantly walked up to Nicholas and whispered in his ear in a very brief
sentence (for Tim was ordinarily a man of few words), that he had taken
down the address in the Strand, and would call upon him that evening, at
eight. Having done which, Tim wiped his spectacles and put them on, preparatory
to hearing what more the brothers Cheeryble had got to say.

<P>`Tim,' said brother Charles, `you understand that we have an intention
of taking this young gentleman into the counting-house?'

<P>Brother Ned remarked that Tim was aware of that intention, and quite
approved of it; and Tim having nodded, and said he did, drew himself up
and looked particularly fat, and very important. After which, there was
a profound silence.

<P>`I'm not coming an hour later in the morning, you know,' said Tim, breaking
out all at once, and looking very resolute. `I'm not going to sleep in
the fresh air--no, nor I'm not going into the country either. A pretty
thing at this time of day, certainly. Pho!'

<P>`Damn your obstinacy, Tim Linkinwater,' said brother Charles, looking
at him without the faintest spark of anger, and with a countenance radiant
with attachment to the old clerk. `Damn your obstinacy, Tim Linkinwater,
what do you mean, sir?'

<P>`It's forty-four year,' said Tim, making a calculation in the air with
his pen, and drawing an imaginary line before he cast it up, `forty-four
year, next May, since I first kept the books of Cheeryble, Brothers. I've
opened the safe every morning all that time (Sundays excepted) as the clock
struck nine, and gone over the house every night at half-past ten (except
on Foreign Post nights, and then twenty minutes before twelve) to see the
doors fastened, and the fires out. I've never slept out of the back-attic
one single night. There's the same mignonette box in the middle of the
window, and the same four flower-pots, two on each side, that I brought
with me when I first came. There an't--I've said it again and again, and
I'll maintain it--there an't such a square as this in the world. I <I>know</I>
there an't,' said Tim, with sudden energy, and looking sternly about him.
`Not one. For business or pleasure, in summer-time or winter--I don't care
which--there's nothing like it. There's not such a spring in England as
the pump under the archway. There's not such a view in England as the view
out of my window; I've seen it every morning before I shaved, and I ought
to know something about it. I have slept in that room,' added Tim, sinking
his voice a little, `for four-and-forty year; and if it wasn't inconvenient,
and didn't interfere with business, I should request leave to die there.'

<P>`Damn you, Tim Linkinwater, how dare you talk about dying?' roared the
twins by one impulse, and blowing their old noses violently.

<P>`That's what I've got to say, Mr Edwin and Mr Charles,' said Tim, squaring
his shoulders again. `This isn't the first time you've talked about superannuating
me; but, if you please, we'll make it the last, and drop the subject for
evermore.'

<P>With these words, Tim Linkinwater stalked out, and shut himself up in
his glass case, with the air of a man who had had his say, and was thoroughly
resolved not to be put down.

<P>The brothers interchanged looks, and coughed some half-dozen times without
speaking.

<P>`He must be done something with, brother Ned,' said the other, warmly;
`we must disregard his old scruples; they can't be tolerated, or borne.
He must be made a partner, brother Ned; and if he won't submit to it peaceably,
we must have recourse to violence.'

<P>`Quite right,' replied brother Ned, nodding his head as a man thoroughly
determined; `quite right, my dear brother. If he won't listen to reason,
we must do it against his will, and show him that we are determined to
exert our authority. We must quarrel with him, brother Charles.'

<P>`We must--we certainly must have a quarrel with Tim Linkinwater,' said
the other. `But in the meantime, my dear brother, we are keeping our young
friend; and the poor lady and her daughter will be anxious for his return.
So let us say goodbye for the present, and--there, there--take care of
that box, my dear sir--and--no, no, not a word now; but be careful of the
crossings and--'

<P>And with any disjointed and unconnected words which would prevent Nicholas
from pouring forth his thanks, the brothers hurried him out: shaking hands
with him all the way, and affecting very unsuccessfully--they were poor
hands at deception!--to be wholly unconscious of the feelings that completely
mastered him.

<P>Nicholas's heart was too full to allow of his turning into the street
until he had recovered some composure. When he at last glided out of the
dark doorway corner in which he had been compelled to halt, he caught a
glimpse of the twins stealthily peeping in at one corner of the glass case,
evidently undecided whether they should follow up their late attack without
delay, or for the present postpone laying further siege to the inflexible
Tim Linkinwater.

<P>To recount all the delight and wonder which the circumstances just detailed
awakened at Miss La Creevy's, and all the things that were done, said,
thought, expected, hoped, and prophesied in consequence, is beside the
present course and purpose of these adventures. It is sufficient to state,
in brief, that Mr Timothy Linkinwater arrived, punctual to his appointment;
that, oddity as he was, and jealous, as he was bound to be, of the proper
exercise of his employers' most comprehensive liberality, he reported strongly
and warmly in favour of Nicholas; and that, next day, he was appointed
to the vacant stool in the counting-house of Cheeryble, Brothers, with
a present salary of one hundred and twenty pounds a year.

<P>`And I think, my dear brother,' said Nicholas's first friend, `that
if we were to let them that little cottage at Bow which is empty, at something
under the usual rent, now--eh, brother Ned?'

<P>`For nothing at all,' said brother Ned. `We are rich, and should be
ashamed to touch the rent under such circumstances as these. Where is Tim
Linkinwater?--for nothing at all, my dear brother, for nothing at all.'

<P>`Perhaps it would be better to say something, brother Ned,' suggested
the other, mildly; `it would help to preserve habits of frugality, you
know, and remove any painful sense of overwhelming obligations. We might
say fifteen pound, or twenty pound, and if it was punctually paid, make
it up to them in some other way. And I might secretly advance a small loan
towards a little furniture, and you might secretly advance another small
loan, brother Ned; and if we find them doing well--as we shall; there's
no fear, no fear--we can change the loans into gifts--carefully, brother
Ned, and by degrees, and without pressing upon them too much; what do you
say now, brother?'

<P>Brother Ned gave his hand upon it, and not only said it should be done,
but had it done too; and, in one short week, Nicholas took possession of
the stool, and Mrs Nickleby and Kate took possession of the house, and
all was hope, bustle, and light-heartedness.

<P>There surely never was such a week of discoveries and surprises as the
first week of that cottage. Every night when Nicholas came home, something
new had been found out. One day it was a grapevine, and another day it
was a boiler, and another day it was the key of the front-parlour closet
at the bottom of the water-butt, and so on through a hundred items. Then,
this room was embellished with a muslin curtain, and that room was rendered
quite elegant by a window-blind, and such improvements were made, as no
one would have supposed possible. Then there was Miss La Creevy, who had
come out in the omnibus to stop a day or two and help, and who was perpetually
losing a very small brown-paper parcel of tin tacks and a very large hammer,
and running about with her sleeves tucked up at the wrists, and falling
off pairs of steps and hurting herself very much--and Mrs Nickleby, who
talked incessantly, and did something now and then, but not often--and
Kate, who busied herself noiselessly everywhere, and was pleased with everything--and
Smike, who made the garden a perfect wonder to look upon--and Nicholas,
who helped and encouraged them every one--all the peace and cheerfulness
of home restored, with such new zest imparted to every frugal pleasure,
and such delight to every hour of meeting, as misfortune and separation
alone could give!

<P>In short, the poor Nicklebys were social and happy; while the rich Nickleby
was alone and miserable.
