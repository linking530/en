<CENTER><I>Nicholas despairs of rescuing Madeline Bray, but plucks up his
spirits again, and determines to attempt it. domestic intelligence of the
Kenwigses and Lillyvicks</I></CENTER>


<P>F<FONT SIZE=-1>INDING</FONT> that Newman was determined to arrest his
progress at any hazard, and apprehensive that some well-intentioned passenger,
attracted by the cry of `Stop thief,' might lay violent hands upon his
person, and place him in a disagreeable predicament from which he might
have some difficulty in extricating himself, Nicholas soon slackened his
pace, and suffered Newman Noggs to come up with him: which he did, in so
breathless a condition, that it seemed impossible he could have held out
for a minute longer.

<P>`I will go straight to Bray's,' said Nicholas. `I will see this man.
If there is a feeling of humanity lingering in his breast, a spark of consideration
for his own child, motherless and friendless as she is, I will awaken it.'

<P>`You will not,' replied Newman. `You will not, indeed.'

<P>`Then,' said Nicholas, pressing onward, `I will act upon my first impulse,
and go straight to Ralph Nickleby.'

<P>`By the time you reach his house he will be in bed,' said Newman.

<P>`I'll drag him from it,' cried Nicholas.

<P>`Tut, tut,' said Noggs. `Be yourself.'

<P>`You are the best of friends to me, Newman,' rejoined Nicholas after
a pause, and taking his hand as he spoke. `I have made head against many
trials; but the misery of another, and such misery, is involved in this
one, that I declare to you I am rendered desperate, and know not how to
act.'

<P>In truth, it did seem a hopeless case. It was impossible to make any
use of such intelligence as Newman Noggs had gleaned, when he lay concealed
in the closet. The mere circumstance of the compact between Ralph Nickleby
and Gride would not invalidate the marriage, or render Bray averse to it,
who, if he did not actually know of the existence of some such understanding,
doubtless suspected it. What had been hinted with reference to some fraud
on Madeline, had been put, with sufficient obscurity, by Arthur Gride,
but coming from Newman Noggs, and obscured still further by the smoke of
his pocketpistol, it became wholly unintelligible, and involved in utter
darkness.

<P>`There seems no ray of hope,' said Nicholas.

<P>`The greater necessity for coolness, for reason, for consideration,
for thought,' said Newman, pausing at every alternate word, to look anxiously
in his friend's face. `Where are the brothers?'

<P>`Both absent on urgent business, as they will be for a week to come.'

<P>`Is there no way of communicating with them? no way of getting one of
them here by tomorrow night?'

<P>`Impossible!' said Nicholas, `the sea is between us and them. With the
fairest winds that ever blew, to go and return would take three days and
nights.'

<P>`Their nephew,' said Newman, `their old clerk.'

<P>`What could either do, that I cannot?' rejoined Nicholas. `With reference
to them, especially, I am enjoined to the strictest silence on this subject.
What right have I to betray the confidence reposed in me, when nothing
but a miracle can prevent this sacrifice?'

<P>`Think,' urged Newman. `Is there no way.'

<P>`There is none,' said Nicholas, in utter dejection. `Not one. The father
urges--the daughter consents. These demons have her in their toils; legal
right, might, power, money, and every influence are on their side. How
can I hope to save her?'

<P>`Hope to the last!' said Newman, clapping him on the back. `Always hope;
that's dear boy. Never leave off hoping; it don't answer. Do you mind me,
Nick? it don't answer. Don't leave a stone unturned. It's always something,
to know you've done the most you could. But, don't leave off hoping, or
it's of no use doing anything. Hope, hope, to the last!'

<P>Nicholas needed encouragement. The suddenness with which intelligence
of the two usurers' plans had come upon him, the little time which remained
for exertion, the probability, almost amounting to certainty itself, that
a few hours would place Madeline Bray for ever beyond his reach, consign
her to unspeakable misery, and perhaps to an untimely death; all this quite
stunned and overwhelmed him. Every hope connected with her that he had
suffered himself to form, or had entertained unconsciously, seemed to fall
at his feet, withered and dead. Every charm with which his memory or imagination
had surrounded her, presented itself before him, only to heighten his anguish
and add new bitterness to his despair. Every feeling of sympathy for her
forlorn condition, and of admiration for her heroism and fortitude, aggravated
the indignation which shook him in every limb, and swelled his heart almost
to bursting.

<P>But, if Nicholas's own heart embarrassed him, Newman's came to his relief.
There was so much earnestness in his remonstrance, and such sincerity and
fervour in his manner, odd and ludicrous as it always was, that it imparted
to Nicholas new firmness, and enabled him to say, after he had walked on
for some little way in silence.

<P>`You read me a good lesson, Newman, and I will profit by it. One step,
at least, I may take--am bound to take indeed--and to that I will apply
myself tomorrow.'

<P>`What is that?' asked Noggs wistfully. `Not to threaten Ralph? Not to
see the father?'

<P>`To see the daughter, Newman,' replied Nicholas. `To do what, after
all, is the utmost that the brothers could do, if they were here, as Heaven
send they were! To reason with her upon this hideous union, to point out
to her all the horrors to which she is hastening; rashly, it may be, and
without due reflection. To entreat her, at least, to pause. She can have
had no counsellor for her good. Perhaps even I may move her so far yet,
though it is the eleventh hour, and she upon the very brink of ruin.'

<P>`Bravely spoken!' said Newman. `Well done, well done! Yes. Very good.'

<P>`And I do declare,' cried Nicholas, with honest enthusiasm, `that in
this effort I am influenced by no selfish or personal considerations, but
by pity for her, and detestation and abhorrence of this scheme; and that
I would do the same, were there twenty rivals in the field, and I the last
and least favoured of them all.'

<P>`You would, I believe,' said Newman. `But where are you hurrying now?'

<P>`Homewards,' answered Nicholas. `Do you come with me, or I shall say
good-night?'

<P>`I'll come a little way, if you will but walk: not run,' said Noggs.

<P>`I cannot walk tonight, Newman,' returned Nicholas, hurriedly. `I must
move rapidly, or I could not draw my breath. I'll tell you what I've said
and done tomorrow.'

<P>Without waiting for a reply, he darted off at a rapid pace, and, plunging
into the crowds which thronged the street, was quickly lost to view.

<P>`He's a violent youth at times,' said Newman, looking after him; `and
yet like him for it. There's cause enough now, or the deuce is in it. Hope!
I <I>said</I> hope, I think! Ralph Nickleby and Gride with their heads
together--and hope for the opposite party! Ho! ho!'

<P>It was with a very melancholy laugh that Newman Noggs concluded this
soliloquy; and it was with a very melancholy shake of the head, and a very
rueful countenance, that he turned about, and went plodding on his way.

<P>This, under ordinary circumstances, would have been to some small tavern
or dram-shop; that being his way, in more senses than one. But, Newman
was too much interested, and too anxious, to betake himself even to this
resource, and so, with many desponding and dismal reflections, went straight
home.

<P>It had come to pass, that afternoon, that Miss Morleena Kenwigs had
received an invitation to repair next day, per steamer from Westminster
Bridge, unto the Eel-pie Island at Twickenham: there to make merry upon
a cold collation, bottled beer, shrub, and shrimps, and to dance in the
open air to the music of a locomotive band, conveyed thither for the purpose:
the steamer being specially engaged by a dancing-master of extensive connection
for the accommodation of his numerous pupils, and the pupils displaying
their appreciation of the dancing-master's services, by purchasing themselves,
and inducing their friends to do the like, divers light blue tickets, entitling
them to join the expedition. Of these light blue tickets, one had been
presented by an ambitious neighbour to Miss Morleena Kenwigs, with an invitation
to join her daughters; and Mrs Kenwigs, rightly deeming that the honour
of the family was involved in Miss Morleena's making the most splendid
appearance possible on so short a notice, and testifying to the dancing-master
that there were other dancing-masters besides him, and to all fathers and
mothers present that other people's children could learn to be genteel
besides theirs, had fainted away twice under the magnitude of her preparations,
but, upheld by a determination to sustain the family name or perish in
the attempt, was still hard at work when Newman Noggs came home.

<P>Now, between the italian-ironing of frills, the flouncing of trousers,
the trimming of frocks, the faintings and the comings-to again, incidental
to the occasion, Mrs Kenwigs had been so entirely occupied, that she had
not observed, until within half an hour before, that the flaxen tails of
Miss Morleena's hair were, in a manner, run to seed; and that, unless she
were put under the hands of a skilful hairdresser, she never could achieve
that signal triumph over the daughters of all other people, anything less
than which would he tantamount to defeat. This discovery drove Mrs Kenwigs
to despair; for the hairdresser lived three streets and eight dangerous
crossings off; Morleena could not be trusted to go there alone, even if
such a proceeding were strictly proper: of which Mrs Kenwigs had her doubts;
Mr Kenwigs had not returned from business; and there was nobody to take
her. So, Mrs Kenwigs first slapped Miss Kenwigs for being the cause of
her vexation, and then shed tears.

<P>`You ungrateful child!' said Mrs Kenwigs, `after I have gone through
what I have, this night, for your good.'

<P>`I can't help it, ma,' replied Morleena, also in tears; `my hair <I>will</I>
grow.'

<P>`Don't talk to me, you naughty thing!' said Mrs Kenwigs, `don't! Even
if I was to trust you by yourself and you were to escape being run over,
I know you'd run in to Laura Chopkins,' who was the daughter of the ambitious
neighbour, `and tell her what you're going to wear tomorrow, I know you
would. You've no proper pride in yourself, and are not to be trusted out
of sight for an instant.'

<P>Deploring the evil-mindedness of her eldest daughter in these terms,
Mrs Kenwigs distilled fresh drops of vexation from her eyes, and declared
that she did believe there never was anybody so tried as she was. Thereupon,
Morleena Kenwigs wept afresh, and they bemoaned themselves together.

<P>Matters were at this point, as Newman Noggs was heard to limp past the
door on his way upstairs; when Mrs Kenwigs, gaining new hope from the sound
of his footsteps, hastily removed from her countenance as many traces of
her late emotion as were effaceable on so short a notice: and presenting
herself before him, and representing their dilemma, entreated that he would
escort Morleena to the hairdresser's shop.

<P>`I wouldn't ask you, Mr Noggs,' said Mrs Kenwigs, `if I didn't know
what a good, kind-hearted creature you are--no, not for worlds. I am a
weak constitution, Mr Noggs, but my spirit would no more let me ask a favour
where I thought there was a chance of its being refused, than it would
let me submit to see my children trampled down and trod upon by envy and
lowness!'

<P>Newman was too good-natured not to have consented, even without this
avowal of confidence on the part of Mrs Kenwigs. Accordingly, a very few
minutes had elapsed, when he and Miss Morleena were on their way to the
hairdresser's.

<P>It was not exactly a hairdresser's; that is to say, people of a coarse
and vulgar turn of mind might have called it a barber's; for they not only
cut and curled ladies elegantly, and children carefully, but shaved gentlemen
easily. Still, it was a highly genteel establishment--quite first-rate
in fact--and there were displayed in the window, besides other elegancies,
waxen busts of a light lady and a dark gentleman which were the admiration
of the whole neighbourhood. Indeed, some ladies had gone so far as to assert,
that the dark gentleman was actually a portrait of the spirted young proprietor;
and the great similarity between their head-dresses--both wore very glossy
hair, with a narrow walk straight down the middle, and a profusion of flat
circular curls on both sides--encouraged the idea. The better informed
among the sex, however, made light of this assertion, for however willing
they were (and they were very willing) to do full justice to the handsome
face and figure of the proprietor, they held the countenance of the dark
gentleman in the window to be an exquisite and abstract idea of masculine
beauty, realised sometimes, perhaps, among angles and military men, but
very rarely embodied to gladden the eyes of mortals.

<P>It was to this establishment that Newman Noggs led Miss Kenwigs in safety.
The proprietor, knowing that Miss Kenwigs had three sisters, each with
two flaxen tails, and all good for sixpence apiece, once a month at least,
promptly deserted an old gentleman whom he had just lathered for shaving,
and handing him over to the journeyman, (who was not very popular among,
the ladies, by reason of his obesity and middle age,) waited on the young
lady himself.

<P>Just as this change had been effected, there presented himself for shaving,
a big, burly, good-humoured coal-heaver with a pipe in his mouth, who,
drawing his hand across his chin, requested to know when a shaver would
be disengaged.

<P>The journeyman, to whom this question was put, looked doubtfully at
the young proprietor, and the young proprietor looked scornfully at the
coal-heaver: observing at the same time--

<P>`You won't get shaved here, my man.'

<P>`Why not?' said the coal-heaver.

<P>`We don't shave gentlemen in your line,' remarked the young proprietor.

<P>`Why, I see you a shaving of a baker, when I was a looking through the
winder, last week,' said the coal-heaver.

<P>`It's necessary to draw the line somewheres, my fine feller,' replied
the principal. `We draw the line there. We can't go beyond bakers. If we
was to get any lower than bakers, our customers would desert us, and we
might shut up shop. You must try some other establishment, sir. We couldn't
do it here.'

<P>The applicant stared; grinned at Newman Noggs, who appeared highly entertained;
looked slightly round the shop, as if in depreciation of the pomatum pots
and other articles of stock; took his pipe out of his mouth and gave a
very loud whistle; and then put it in again, and walked out.

<P>The old gentleman who had just been lathered, and who was sitting in
a melancholy manner with his face turned towards the wall, appeared quite
unconscious of this incident, and to be insensible to everything around
him in the depth of a reverie--a very mournful one, to judge from the sighs
he occasionally vented--in which he was absorbed. Affected by this example,
the proprietor began to clip Miss Kenwigs, the journeyman to scrape the
old gentleman, and Newman Noggs to read last Sunday's paper, all three
in silence: when Miss Kenwigs uttered a shrill little scream, and Newman,
raising his eyes, saw that it had been elicited by the circumstance of
the old gentleman turning his head, and disclosing the features of Mr Lillyvick
the collector.

<P>The features of Mr Lillyvick they were, but strangely altered. If ever
an old gentleman had made a point of appearing in public, shaved close
and clean, that old gentleman was Mr Lillyvick. If ever a collector had
borne himself like a collector, and assumed, before all men, a solemn and
portentous dignity as if he had the world on his books and it was all two
quarters in arrear, that collector was Mr Lillyvick. And now, there he
sat, with the remains of a beard at least a week old encumbering his chin;
a soiled and crumpled shirt-frill crouching, as it were, upon his breast,
instead of standing boldly out; a demeanour so abashed and drooping, so
despondent, and expressive of such humiliation, grief, and shame; that
if the souls of forty unsubstantial housekeepers, all of whom had had their
water cut off for non-payment of the rate, could have been concentrated
in one body, that one body could hardly have expressed such mortification
and defeat as were now expressed in the person of Mr Lillyvick the collector.

<P>Newman Noggs uttered his name, and Mr Lillyvick groaned: then coughed
to hide it. But the groan was a full-sized groan, and the cough was but
a wheeze.

<P>`Is anything the matter?' said Newman Noggs.

<P>`Matter, sir!' cried Mr Lillyvick. `The plug of life is dry, sir, and
but the mud is left.'

<P>This speech--the style of which Newman attributed to Mr Lillyvick's
recent association with theatrical characters--not being quite explanatory,
Newman looked as if he were about to ask another question, when Mr Lillyvick
prevented him by shaking his hand mournfully, and then waving his own.

<P>`Let me be shaved!' said Mr Lillyvick. `It shall be done before Morleena--it
<I>is</I> Morleena, isn't it?'

<P>`Kenwigses said Newman.

<P>`Kenwigses have got a boy, haven't they?' inquired the collector.

<P>Again Newman said `Yes.'

<P>`Is it a nice boy?' demanded the collector.

<P>`It ain't very nasty one,' returned Newman, rather embarrassed by the
question.

<P>`Susan Kenwigs used to say,' observed the collector, `that if ever she
had another boy, she hoped it might be like me. Is this one like me, Mr
Noggs?'

<P>This was a puzzling inquiry; but Newman evaded it, by replying to Mr
Lillyvick, that he thought the baby might possibly come like him in time.

<P>`I should be glad to have somebody like me, somehow,' said Mr Lillyvick,
`before I die.'

<P>`You don't mean to do that, yet awhile?' said Newman.

<P>Unto which Mr Lillyvick replied in a solemn voice, `Let me be shaved!'
and again consigning himself to the hands of the journeyman, said no more.

<P>This was remarkable behaviour. So remarkable did it seem to Miss Morleena,
that that young lady, at the imminent hazard of having her ear sliced off,
had not been able to forbear looking round, some score of times, during
the foregoing colloquy. Of her, however, Mr Lillyvick took no notice: rather
striving (so, at least, it seemed to Newman Noggs) to evade her observation,
and to shrink into himself whenever he attracted her regards. Newman wondered
very much what could have occasioned this altered behaviour on the part
of the collector; but, philosophically reflecting that he would most likely
know, sooner or later, and that he could perfectly afford to wait, he was
very little disturbed by the singularity of the old gentleman's deportment.

<P>The cutting and curling being at last concluded, the old gentleman,
who had been some time waiting, rose to go, and, walking out with Newman
and his charge, took Newman's arm, and proceeded for some time without
making any observation. Newman, who in power of taciturnity was excelled
by few people, made no attempt to break silence; and so they went on, until
they had very nearly reached Miss Morleena's home, when Mr Lillyvick said--

<P>`Were the Kenwigses very much overpowered, Mr Noggs, by that news?'

<P>`What news?' returned Newman.

<P>`That about--my being--'

<P>`Married?' suggested Newman.

<P>`Ah!' replied Mr Lillyvick, with another groan--this time not even disguised
by a wheeze.

<P>`It made ma cry when she knew it,' interposed Miss Morleena, `but we
kept it from her for a long time; and pa was very low in his spirits, but
he is better now; and I was very ill, but I am better too.'

<P>`Would you give your great-uncle Lillyvick a kiss if he was to ask you,
Morleena?' said the collector, with some hesitation.

<P>`Yes,--uncle Lillyvick, I would,' returned Miss Morleena, with the energy
of both her parents combined; `but not aunt Lillyvick. She's not an aunt
of mine, and I'll never call her one.'

<P>Immediately upon the utterance of these words, Mr Lillyvick caught Miss
Morleena up in his arms, and kissed her; and, being by this time at the
door of the house where Mr Kenwigs lodged (which, as has been before mentioned,
usually stood wide open), he walked straight up into Mr Kenwigs's sitting-room,
and put Miss Morleena down in the midst. Mr and Mrs Kenwigs were at supper.
At sight of their perjured relative, Mrs Kenwigs turned faint and pale,
and Mr Kenwigs rose majestically.

<P>`Kenwigs,' said the collector, `shake hands.'

<P>`Sir,' said Mr Kenwigs, `the time has been, when I was proud to shake
hands with such a man as that man as now surweys me. The time has been,
sir,' said Mr Kenwigs, `when a wisit from that man has excited in me and
my family's boozums sensations both nateral and awakening. But, now, I
look upon that man with emotions totally surpassing everythink, and I ask
myself where is his <I>h</I>onour, where is his straightfor'ardness, and
where is his human natur?'

<P>`Susan Kenwigs,' said Mr Lillyvick, turning humbly to his niece, `don't
you say anything to me?'

<P>`She is not equal to it, sir,' said Mr Kenwigs, striking the table emphatically.
`What with the nursing of a healthy babby, and the reflections upon your
cruel conduct, four pints of malt liquor a day is hardly able to sustain
her.'

<P>`I am glad,' said the poor collector meekly, `that the baby is a healthy
one. I am very glad of that.'

<P>This was touching the Kenwigses on their tenderest point. Mrs Kenwigs
instantly burst into tears, and Mr Kenwigs evinced great emotion.

<P>`My pleasantest feeling, all the time that child was expected,' said
Mr Kenwigs, mournfully, `was a thinking, "If it's a boy, as I hope it may
be; for I have heard its uncle Lillyvick say again and again he would prefer
our having a boy next--if it's a boy, what will his uncle Lillyvick say--what
will he like him to be called--will he be Peter, or Alexander,or Pompey,
or Diorgeenes, or what will he be?" and now when I look at him--a precious,
unconscious, helpless infant, with no use in his little arms but to tear
his little cap, and no use in his little legs but to kick his little self--when
I see him a lying on his mother's lap, cooing and cooing, and, in his innocent
state, almost a choking hisself with his little fist--when I see him such
a infant as he is, and think that that uncle Lillyvick, as was once a-going
to be so fond of him, has withdrawed himself away, such a feeling of wengeance
comes over me as no language can depicter, and I feel as if even that holy
babe was a telling me to hate him.'

<P>This affecting picture moved Mrs Kenwigs deeply. After several imperfect
words, which vainly attempted to struggle to the surface, but were drowned
and washed away by the strong tide of her tears, she spake.

<P>`Uncle,' said Mrs Kenwigs, `to think that you should have turned your
back upon me and my dear children, and upon Kenwigs which is the author
of their being--you who was once so kind and affectionate, and who, if
anybody had told us such a thing of, we should have withered with scorn
like lightning--you that little Lillyvick, our first and earliest boy,
was named after at the very altar--oh gracious!'

<P>`Was it money that we cared for?' said Mr Kenwigs. `Was it property
that we ever thought of?'

<P>`No,' cried Mrs Kenwigs, `I scorn it.'

<P>`So do I,' said Mr Kenwigs, `and always did.'

<P>`My feelings have been lancerated,' said Mrs Kenwigs, `my heart has
been torn asunder with anguish, I have been thrown back in my confinement,
my unoffending infant has been rendered uncomfortable and fractious, Morleena
has pined herself away to nothing; all this I forget and forgive, and with
you, uncle, I never can quarrel. But never ask me to receive <I>her</I>--never
do it, uncle. For I will not, I will not, I won't, I won't, I won't!'

<P>`Susan, my dear,' said Mr Kenwigs, `consider your child.'

<P>`Yes,' shrieked Mrs Kenwigs, `I will consider my child! I will consider
my child! my own child, that no uncles can deprive me of; my own hated,
despised, deserted, cut-off little child.' And, here, the emotions of Mrs
Kenwigs became so violent, that Mr Kenwigs was fain to administer hartshorn
internally, and vinegar externally, and to destroy a staylace, four petticoat
strings, and several small buttons.

<P>Newman had been a silent spectator of this scene; for Mr Lillyvick had
signed to him not to withdraw, and Mr Kenwigs had further solicited his
presence by a nod of invitation. When Mrs Kenwigs had been, in some degree,
restored, and Newman, as a person possessed of some influence with her,
had remonstrated and begged her to compose herself, Mr Lillyvick said in
a faltering voice:

<P>`I never shall ask anybody here to receive my--I needn't mention the
word; you know what I mean. Kenwigs and Susan, yesterday was a week she
eloped with a half-pay captain!'

<P>Mr and Mrs Kenwigs started together.

<P>`Eloped with a half-pay captain,' repeated Mr Lillyvick, `basely and
falsely eloped with a half-pay captain--with a bottle-nosed captain that
any man might have considered himself safe from. It was in this room,'
said Mr Lillyvick, looking sternly round, `that I first see Henrietta Petowker.
It is in this room that I turn her off for ever.'

<P>This declaration completely changed the whole posture of affairs. Mrs
Kenwigs threw herself upon the old gentleman's neck, bitterly reproaching
herself for her late harshness, and exclaiming, if she had suffered, what
must his sufferings have been! Mr Kenwigs grasped his hand, and vowed eternal
friendship and remorse. Mrs Kenwigs was horror-stricken to think that she
should ever have nourished in her bosom such a snake, adder, viper, serpent,
and base crocodile as Henrietta Petowker. Mr Kenwigs argued that she must
have been bad indeed not to have improved by so long a contemplation of
Mrs Kenwigs's virtue. Mrs Kenwigs remembered that Mr Kenwigs had often
said that he was not quite satisfied of the propriety of Miss Petowker's
conduct, and wondered how it was that she could have been blinded by such
a wretch. Mr Kenwigs remembered that he had had his suspicious, but did
not wonder why Mrs Kenwigs had not had hers, as she was all chastity, purity,
and truth, and Henrietta all baseness, falsehood, and deceit. And Mr and
Mrs Kenwigs both said, with strong feelings and tears of sympathy, that
everything happened for the best; and conjured the good collector not to
give way to unavailing grief, but to seek consolation in the society of
those affectionate relations whose arms and hearts were ever open to him.

<P>`Out of affection and regard for you, Susan and Kenwigs,' said Mr Lillyvick,
`and not out of revenge and spite against her, for she is below it, I shall,
tomorrow morning, settle upon your children, and make payable to the survivors
of them when they come of age of marry, that money that I once meant to
leave'em in my will. The deed shall be executed tomorrow, and Mr Noggs
shall be one of the witnesses. He hears me promise this, and he shall see
it done.'

<P>Overpowered by this noble and generous offer, Mr Kenwigs, Mrs Kenwigs,
and Miss Morleena Kenwigs, all began to sob together; and the noise of
their sobbing, communicating itself to the next room, where the children
lay abed, and causing them to cry too, Mr Kenwigs rushed wildly in, and
bringing them out in his arms, by two and two, tumbled them down in their
nightcaps and gowns at the feet of Mr Lillyvick, and called upon them to
thank and bless him.

<P>`And now,' said Mr Lillyvick, when a heart-rending scene had ensued
and the children were cleared away again, `give me some supper. This took
place twenty mile from town. I came up this morning, and have being lingering
about all day, without being able to make up my mind to come and see you.
I humoured her in everything, she had her own way, she did just as she
pleased, and now she has done this. There was twelve tea-spoons and twenty-four
pound in sovereigns--I missed them first--it's a trial--I feel I shall
never be able to knock a double knock again, when I go my rounds--don't
say anything more about it, please--the spoons were worth--never mind--never
mind!'

<P>With such muttered outpourings as these, the old gentleman shed a few
tears; but, they got him into the elbow-chair, and prevailed upon him,
without much pressing, to make a hearty supper, and by the time he had
finished his first pipe, and disposed of half-a-dozen glasses out of a
crown bowl of punch, ordered by Mr Kenwigs, in celebration of his return
to the bosom of his family, he seemed, though still very humble, quite
resigned to his fate, and rather relieved than otherwise by the flight
of his wife.

<P>`When I see that man,' said Mr Kenwigs, with one hand round Mrs Kenwigs's
waist: his other hand supporting his pipe (which made him wink and cough
very much, for he was no smoker): and his eyes on Morleena, who sat upon
her uncle's knee, `when I see that man as mingling, once again, in the
spear which he adorns, and see his affections deweloping themselves in
legitimate sitiwations, I feel that his nature is as elewated and expanded,
as his standing afore society as a public character is unimpeached, and
the woices of my infant children purvided for in life, seem to whisper
to me softly, "This is an ewent at which Evins itself looks down!"'
