<P>I<FONT SIZE=-1>N WALKING FROM THE CITY</FONT> with his sentimental friend,
Tom Pinch had looked into the face, and brushed against the threadbare
sleeve, of Mr. Nadgett, man of mystery to the Anglo-Bengalee Disinterested
Loan and Life Assurance Company. Mr. Nadgett naturally passed away from
Tom's remembrance as he passed out of his view; for he didn't know him,
and had never heard his name.

<P>As there are a vast number of people in the huge metropolis of England
who rise up every morning not knowing where their heads will rest at night,
so there are a multitude who shooting arrows over houses as their daily
business, never know on whom they fall. Mr. Nadgett might have passed Tom
Pinch ten thousand times; might even have been quite familiar with his
face, his name, pursuits, and character; yet never once have dreamed that
Tom had any interest in any act or mystery of his. Tom might have done
the like by him of course. But the same private man out of all the men
alive, was in the mind of each at the same moment; was prominently connected
though in a different manner, with the day's adventures of both; and formed,
when they passed each other in the street, the one absorbing topic of their
thoughts.

<P>Why Tom had Jonas Chuzzlewit in his mind requires no explanation. Why
Mr. Nadgett should have had Jonas Chuzzlewit in his, is quite another thing.

<P>But, somehow or other, that amiable and worthy orphan had become a part
of the mystery of Mr. Nadgett's existence. Mr. Nadgett took an interest
in his lightest proceedings; and it never flagged or wavered. He watched
him in and out of the Assurance Office, where he was now formally installed
as a Director; he dogged his footsteps in the streets; he stood listening
when he talked; he sat in coffee-rooms entering his name in the great pocket-book,
over and over again; he wrote letters to himself about him constantly;
and, when he found them in his pocket, put them in the fire, with such
distrust and caution that he would bend down to watch the crumpled tinder
while it floated upwards, as if his mind misgave him, that the mystery
it had contained might come out at the chimney-pot.

<P>And yet all this was quite a secret. Mr. Nadgett kept it to himself,
and kept it close. Jonas had no more idea that Mr. Nadgett's eyes were
fixed on him, than he had that he was living under the daily inspection
and report of a whole order of Jesuits. Indeed Mr. Nadgett's eyes were
seldom fixed on any other objects than the ground, the clock, or the fire;
but every button on his coat might have been an eye: he saw so much.

<P>The secret manner of the man disarmed suspicion in this wise; suggesting,
not that he was watching any one, but that he thought some other man was
watching him. He went about so stealthily, and kept himself so wrapped
up in himself, that the whole object of his life appeared to be, to avoid
notice and preserve his own mystery. Jonas sometimes saw him in the street,
hovering in the outer office, waiting at the door for the man who never
came, or slinking off with his immovable face and drooping head, and the
one beaver glove dangling before him; but he would as soon have thought
of the cross upon the top of St. Paul's Cathedral taking note of what he
did, or slowly winding a great net about his feet, as of Nadgett's being
engaged in such an occupation.

<P>Mr. Nadgett made a mysterious change about this time in his mysterious
life: for whereas he had, until now, been first seen every morning coming
down Cornhill, so exactly like the Nadgett of the day before as to occasion
a popular belief that he never went to bed or took his clothes off, he
was now first seen in Holborn, coming out of Kingsgate Street; and it was
soon discovered that he actually went every morning to a barber's shop
in that street to get shaved; and that the barber's name was Sweedlepipe.
He seemed to make appointments with the man who never came, to meet him
at this barber's; for he would frequently take long spells of waiting in
the shop, and would ask for pen and ink, and pull out his pocket-book,
and be very busy over it for an hour at a time, Mrs. Gamp and Mr. Sweedlepipe
had many deep discoursings on the subject of this mysterious customer;
but they usually agreed that he had speculated too much and was keeping
out of the way.

<P>He must have appointed the man who never kept his word, to meet him
at another new place too; for one day he was found, for the first time,
by the waiter at the Mourning Coach-Horse, the House-of-call for Undertakers,
down in the City there, making figures with a pipe-stem in the sawdust
of a clean spittoon; and declining to call for anything, on the ground
of expecting a gentleman presently. As the gentleman was not honourable
enough to keep his engagement, he came again next day, with his pocket-book
in such a state of distention that he was regarded in the bar as a man
of large property. After that, he repeated his visits every day, and had
so much writing to do, that he made nothing of emptying a capacious leaden
inkstand in two sittings. Although he never talked much, still, by being
there among the regular customers, he made their acquaintance. and in course
of time became quite intimate with Mr. Tacker, Mr. Mould's foreman; and
even with Mr. Mould himself, who openly said he was a long-headed man,
a dry one, a salt fish, a deep file, a rasper; and made him the subject
of many other flattering encomiums.

<P>At the same time, too, he told the people at the Assurance Office, in
his own mysterious way, that there was something wrong (secretly wrong,
of course) in his liver, and that he feared he must put himself under the
doctor's hands. He was delivered over to Jobling upon this representation;
and though Jobling could not find out where his liver was wrong, wrong
Mr. Nadgett said it was; observing that it was his own liver, and he hoped
he ought to know. Accordingly, he became Mr. Jobling's patient; and detailing
his symptoms in his slow and secret way, was in and out of that gentleman's
room a dozen times a day.

<P>As he pursued all these occupations at once; and all steadily. and all
secretly; and never slackened in his watchfulness of everything that Mr.
Jonas said and did, and left unsaid and undone; it is not improbable that
they were, secretly, essential parts of some great scheme which Mr. Nadgett
had on foot.

<P>It was on the morning of this very day on which so much had happened
to Tom Pinch, that Nadgett suddenly appeared before Mr. Montague's house
in Pall Mall -- he always made his appearance as if he had that moment
come up a trap -- when the clocks were striking nine. He rang the bell
in a covert under-handed way, as though it were a treasonable act; and
passed in at the door, the moment it was opened wide enough to receive
his body. That done, he shut it immediately with his own hands.

<P>Mr. Bailey, taking up his name without delay, returned with a request
that he would follow him into his master's chamber. The chairman of the
Anglo-Bengalee Disinterested Loan and Life Assurance Board was dressing,
and received him as a business person who was often backwards and forwards,
and was received at all times for his business' sake.

<P>`Well, Mr. Nadgett?'

<P>Mr. Nadgett put his hat upon the ground and coughed. The boy having
withdrawn and shut the door, he went to it softly, examined the handle,
and returned to within a pace or two of the chair in which Mr. Montague
sat.

<P>`Any news, Mr. Nadgett?'

<P>`I think we have some news at last, sir.'

<P>`I am happy to hear it. I began to fear you were off the scent, Mr.
Nadgett.'

<P>`No, sir. It grows cold occasionally. It will sometimes. We can't help
that.'

<P>`You are truth itself, Mr. Nadgett. Do you report a great success?'

<P>`That depends upon your judgment and construction of it,' was his answer,
as he put on his spectacles.

<P>`What do you think of it yourself? Have you pleased yourself?'

<P>Mr. Nadgett rubbed his hands slowly, stroked his chin, looked round
the room, and said, `Yes, yes, I think it's a good case. I am disposed
to think it's a good case. Will you go into it at once?'

<P>`By all means.'

<P>Mr. Nadgett picked out a certain chair from among the rest, and having
planted it in a particular spot, as carefully as if he had been going to
vault over it, placed another chair in front of it: leaving room for his
own legs between them. He then sat down in chair number two, and laid his
pocket-book, very carefully, on chair number one. He then untied the pocket-book,
and hung the string over the back of chair number one. He then drew both
the chairs a little nearer Mr. Montague, and opening the pocket-book spread
out its contents. Finally he selected a certain memorandum from the rest,
and held it out to his employer, who, during the whole of these preliminary
ceremonies, had been making violent efforts to conceal his impatience.

<P>`I wish you wouldn't be so fond of making notes, my excellent friend,'
said Tigg Montague with a ghastly smile. `I wish you would consent to give
me their purport by word of mouth.'

<P>`I don't like word of mouth,' said Mr. Nadgett gravely. `We never know
who's listening.'

<P>Mr. Montague was going to retort, when Nadgett handed him the paper,
and said, with quiet exultation in his tone, `We'll begin at the beginning,
and take that one first, if you please, sir.'

<P>The chairman cast his eyes upon it, coldly, and with a smile which did
not render any great homage to the slow and methodical habits of his spy.
But he had not read half-a-dozen lines when the expression of his face
began to change, and before he had finished the perusal of the paper, it
was full of grave and serious attention.

<P>`Number Two,' said Mr. Nadgett, handing him another, and receiving back
the first. `Read Number Two, sir, if you please. There is more interest
as you go on.'

<P>Tigg Montague leaned backward in his chair, and cast upon his emissary
such a look of vacant wonder (not unmingled with alarm), that Mr. Nadgett
considered it necessary to repeat the request he had already twice preferred:
with the view to recalling his attention to the point in hand. Profiting
by the hint, Mr. Montague went on with Number Two, and afterwards with
Numbers Three, and Four, and Five, and so on.

<P>These documents were all in Mr. Nadgett's writing, and were apparently
a series of memoranda, jotted down from time to time upon the backs of
old letters, or any scrap of paper that came first to hand. Loose straggling
scrawls they were, and of very uninviting exterior; but they had weighty
purpose in them, if the chairman's face were any index to the character
of their contents.

<P>The progress of Mr. Nadgett's secret satisfaction arising out of the
effect they made, kept pace with the emotions of the reader. At first,
Mr. Nadgett sat with his spectacles low down upon his nose, looking over
them at his employer, and nervously rubbing his hands. After a little while,
he changed his posture in his chair for one of greater ease, and leisurely
perused the next document he held ready as if an occasional glance at his
employer's face were now enough and all occasion for anxiety or doubt were
gone. And finally he rose and looked out of the window, where he stood
with a triumphant air until Tigg Montague had finished.

<P>`And this is the last, Mr. Nadgett!' said that gentleman, drawing a
long breath.

<P>`That, sir, is the last.'

<P>`You are a wonderful man, Mr. Nadgett!'

<P>`I think it is a pretty good case,' he returned as he gathered up his
papers. `It cost some trouble, sir.'

<P>`The trouble shall be well rewarded, Mr. Nadgett.' Nadgett bowed. `There
is a deeper impression of Somebody's Hoof here, than I had expected, Mr.
Nadgett. I may congratulate myself upon your being such a good hand at
a secret.'

<P>`Oh! nothing has an interest to me that's not a secret,' replied Nadgett,
as he tied the string about his pocket-book, and put it up. `It always
takes away any pleasure I may have had in this inquiry even to make it
known to you.'

<P>`A most invaluable constitution,' Tigg retorted. `A great gift for a
gentleman employed as you are, Mr. Nadgett. Much better than discretion:
though you possess that quality also in an eminent degree. I think I heard
a double knock. Will you put your head out of window, and tell me whether
there is anybody at the door?'

<P>Mr. Nadgett softly raised the sash, and peered out from the very corner,
as a man might who was looking down into a street from whence a brisk discharge
of musketry might be expected at any moment. Drawing in his head with equal
caution, he observed, not altering his voice or manner:

<P>`Mr. Jonas Chuzzlewit!'

<P>`I thought so,' Tigg retorted.

<P>`Shall I go?'

<P>`I think you had better. Stay though! No! remain here, Mr. Nadgett,
if you please.'

<P>It was remarkable how pale and flurried he had become in an instant.
There was nothing to account for it. His eye had fallen on his razors;
but what of them!

<P>Mr. Chuzzlewit was announced.

<P>`Show him up directly. Nadgett! don't you leave us alone together. Mind
you don't, now! By the Lord!' he added in a whisper to himself: `We don't
know what may happen.'

<P>Saying this, he hurriedly took up a couple of hair-brushes, and began
to exercise them on his own head, as if his toilet had not been interrupted.
Mr. Nadgett withdrew to the stove, in which there was a small fire for
the convenience of heating curling-irons; and taking advantage of so favourable
an opportunity for drying his pocket-handkerchief, produced it without
loss of time. There he stood, during the whole interview, holding it before
the bars, and sometimes, but not often, glancing over his shoulder.

<P>`My dear Chuzzlewit!' cried Montague, as Jonas entered: `you rise with
the lark. Though you go to bed with the nightingale, you rise with the
lark. You have superhuman energy, my dear Chuzzlewit!'

<P>`Ecod!' said Jonas, with an air of langour and ill-humour, as he took
a chair, `I should be very glad not to get up with the lark, if I could
help it. But I am a light sleeper; and it's better to be up than lying
awake, counting the dismal old church-clocks, in bed.'

<P>`A light sleeper!' cried his friend. `Now, what is a light sleeper?
I often hear the expression, but upon my life I have not the least conception
what a light sleeper is.'

<P>`Hallo!' said Jonas, `Who's that? Oh, old what's-his-name: looking (as
usual) as if he wanted to skulk up the chimney.'

<P>`Ha, ha! I have no doubt he does.'

<P>`Well! He's not wanted here, I suppose,' said Jonas. `He may go, mayn't
he?'

<P>`Oh, let him stay, let him stay!' said Tigg. `He's a mere piece of furniture.
He has been making his report, and is waiting for further orders. He has
been told,' said Tigg, raising his voice, `not to lose sight of certain
friends of ours, or to think that he has done with them by any means. He
understands his business.'

<P>`He need,' replied Jonas; `for of all the precious old dummies in appearance
that I ever saw, he's about the worst. He's afraid of me, I think.'

<P>`It's my belief,' said Tigg, `that you are Poison to him. Nadgett! give
me that towel!'

<P>He had as little occasion for a towel as Jonas had for a start. But
Nadgett brought it quickly; and, having lingered for a moment, fell back
upon his old post by the fire.

<P>`You see, my dear fellow,' resumed Tigg, `you are too -- What's the
matter with your lips? How white they are!'

<P>`I took some vinegar just now,' said Jonas. `I had oysters for my breakfast.
Where are they white?' he added, muttering an oath, and rubbing them upon
his handkerchief. `I don't believe they <I>are</I> white.'

<P>`Now I look again, they are not,' replied his friend. `They are coming
right again.'

<P>`Say what you were going to say,' cried Jonas angrily, `and let my face
be! As long as I can show my teeth when I want to (and I can do that pretty
well), the colour of my lips is not material.'

<P>`Quite true,' said Tigg. `I was only going to say that you are too quick
and active for our friend. He is too shy to cope with such a man as you,
but does his duty well. Oh, very well! But what is a light sleeper?'

<P>`Hang a light sleeper!' exclaimed Jonas pettishly.

<P>`No, no,' interrupted Tigg. `No. We'll not do that.'

<P>`A light sleeper ain't a heavy one,' said Jonas in his sulky way; `don't
sleep much, and don't sleep well, and don't sleep sound.'

<P>`And dreams,' said Tigg, `and cries out in an ugly manner; and when
the candle burns down in the night, is in an agony; and all that sort of
thing. I see!'

<P>They were silent for a little time. Then Jonas spoke:

<P>`Now we've done with child's talk, I want to have a word with you. I
want to have a word with you before we meet up yonder today. I am not satisfied
with the state of affairs.'

<P>`Not satisfied!' cried Tigg. `The money comes in well.'

<P>`The money comes in well enough,' retorted Jonas: `but it don't come
out well enough. It can't be got at easily enough. I haven't sufficient
power; it is all in your hands. Ecod! what with one of your, by-laws, and
another of your by-laws, and your votes in this capacity, and your votes
in that capacity, and your official rights, and your individual rights,
and other people's rights who are only you again, there are no rights left
for me. Everybody else's rights are my wrongs. What's the use of my having
a voice if it's always drowned? I might as well be dumb, and it would be
much less aggravating. I'm not a-going to stand that, you know.'

<P>`No!' said Tigg in an insinuating tone.

<P>`No!' returned Jonas, `I'm not indeed. I'll play old Gooseberry with
the office, and make you glad to buy me out at a good high figure, if you
try any of your tricks with me.'

<P>`I give you my honour --' Montague began.

<P>`Oh! confound your honour,' interrupted Jonas, who became more coarse
and quarrelsome as the other remonstrated, which may have been a part of
Mr. Montague's intention: `I want a little more control over the money.
You may have all the honour, if you like; I'll never bring you to book
for that. But I'm not a-going to stand it, as it is now. If you should
take it into your honourable head to go abroad with the bank, I don't see
much to prevent you. Well! That won't do. I've had some very good dinners
here, but they'd come too dear on such terms: and therefore that won't
do.'

<P>`I am unfortunate to find you in this humour,' said Tigg, with a remarkable
kind of smile: `for I was going to propose to you -- for your own advantage;
solely for your own advantage -- that you should venture a little more
with us.'

<P>`Was you, by G --?' said Jonas, with a short laugh.

<P>`Yes. And to suggest,' pursued Montague, `that surely you have friends;
indeed, I know you have; who would answer our purpose admirably, and whom
we should be delighted to receive.'

<P>`How kind of you! You'd be delighted to receive 'em, would you?' said
Jonas, bantering.

<P>`I give you my sacred honour, quite transported. As your friends, observe!'

<P>`Exactly,' said Jonas; `as my friends, of course. You'll be very much
delighted when you get 'em, I have no doubt. And it'll be all to my advantage,
won't it?'

<P>`It will be very much to your advantage,' answered Montague poising
a brush in each hand, and looking steadily upon him. `It will be very much
to your advantage, I assure you.'

<P>`And you can tell me how,' said Jonas, `can't you?'

<P>`Shall I tell you how?' returned the other.

<P>`I think you had better,' said Jonas. `Strange things have been whatever
thoughts came crowding on his mind even at that early time, of one terrible
chance of escape, of one red glimmer in a sky of blackness; he no more
thought that the slinking figure half-a-dozen stairs behind him was his
pursuing Fate, than that the other figure at his side was his Good Angel.
