<CENTER><I>Tom Pinch, going astray, finds that he is not the only person
in that predicament. He retaliates upon a fallen foe</I></CENTER>


<P>T<FONT SIZE=-1>OM'S EVIL GENIUS</FONT> did not lead him into the dens
of any of those preparers of cannibalic pastry, who are represented in
many standard country legends as doing a lively retail business in the
Metropolis; nor did it mark him out as the prey of ring-droppers, pea and
thimble-riggers, duffers, touters, or any of those bloodless sharpers,
who are, perhaps, a little better known to the Police. He fell into conversation
with no gentleman who took him into a public-house, where there happened
to be another gentleman who swore he had more money than any gentleman,
and very soon proved he had more money than one gentleman by taking his
away from him: neither did he fall into any other of the numerous man-traps
which are set up without notice, in the public grounds of this city. But
he lost his way. He very soon did that; and in trying to find it again
he lost it more and more.

<P>Now Tom, in his guileless distrust of London, thought himself very knowing
in coming to the determination that he would not ask to be directed to
Furnival's Inn, if he could help it; unless, indeed, he should happen to
find himself near the Mint, or the Bank of England; in which case he would
step in, and ask a civil question or two, confiding in the perfect respectability
of the concern. So on he went, looking up all the streets he came near,
and going up half of them; and thus, by dint of not being true to Goswell
Street, and filing off into Aldermanbury, and bewildering himself in Barbican,
and being constant to the wrong point of the compass in London Wall, and
then getting himself crosswise into Thames Street, by an instinct that
would have been marvellous if he had had the least desire or reason to
go there, he found himself, at last, hard by the Monument.

<P>The Man in the Monument was quite as mysterious a being to Tom as the
Man in the Moon. It immediately occurred to him that the lonely creature
who held himself aloof from all mankind in that pillar like some old hermit
was the very man of whom to ask his way. Cold, he might be; little sympathy
he had, perhaps, with human passion -- the column seemed too tall for that;
but if Truth didn't live in the base of the Monument, notwithstanding Pope's
couplet about the outside of it, where in London (thought Tom) was she
likely to be found!

<P>Coming close below the pillar, it was a great encouragement to Tom to
find that the Man in the Monument had simple tastes; that stony and artificial
as his residence was, he still preserved some rustic recollections; that
he liked plants, hung up bird-cages, was not wholly cut off from fresh
groundsel, and kept young trees in tubs. The Man in the Monument, himself,
was sitting outside the door -- his own door: the Monument-door: what a
grand idea! -- and was actually yawning, as if there were no Monument to
stop his mouth, and give him a perpetual interest in his own existence.

<P>Tom was advancing towards this remarkable creature, to inquire the way
to Furnival's Inn, when two people came to see the Monument. They were
a gentleman and a lady; and the gentleman said, `How much a-piece?'

<P>The Man in the Monument replied, `A Tanner.'

<P>It seemed a low expression, compared with the Monument.

<P>The gentleman put a shilling into his hand, and the Man in the Monument
opened a dark little door. When the gentleman and lady had passed out of
view, he shut it again, and came slowly back to his chair.

<P>He sat down and laughed.

<P>`They don't know what a many steps there is!' he said. `It's worth twice
the money to stop here. Oh, my eye!'

<P>The Man in the Monument was a Cynic; a worldly man! Tom couldn't ask
his way of <I>him</I>. He was prepared to put no confidence in anything
he said.

<P>`My gracious!' cried a well-known voice behind Mr. Pinch. `Why, to be
sure it is!'

<P>At the same time he was poked in the back by a parasol. Turning round
to inquire into this salute, he beheld the eldest daughter of his late
patron.

<P>`Miss Pecksniff!' said Tom.

<P>`Why, my goodness, Mr. Pinch!' cried Cherry. `What are you doing here?'

<P>`I have rather wandered from my way,' said Tom. `I--'

<P>`I hope you have run away,' said Charity. `It would be quite spirited
and proper if you had, when my Papa so far forgets himself.'

<P>`I have left him,' returned Tom. `But it was perfectly understood on
both sides. It was not done clandestinely.'

<P>`Is he married?' asked Cherry, with a spasmodic shake of her chin.

<P>`No, not yet,' said Tom, colouring: `to tell you the truth, I don't
think he is likely to be, if -- if Miss Graham is the object of his passion.'

<P>`Tcha, Mr. Pinch!' cried Charity, with sharp impatience, `you're very
easily deceived. You don't know the arts of which such a creature is capable.
Oh! it's a wicked world.'

<P>`You are not married?' Tom hinted, to divert the conversation.

<P>`N--no!' said Cherry, tracing out one particular paving-stone in Monument
Yard with the end of her parasol. `I -- but really it's quite impossible
to explain. Won't you walk in?'

<P>`You live here, then?' said Tom

<P>`Yes,' returned Miss Pecksniff, pointing with her parasol to Todgers's:
`I reside with this lady, <I>at present</I>.'

<P>The great stress on the two last words suggested to Tom that he was
expected to say something in reference to them. So he said.

<P>`Only at present! Are you going home again soon?'

<P>`No, Mr. Pinch,' returned Charity. `No, thank you. No! A mother-in-law
who is younger than -- I mean to say, who is as nearly as possible about
the same age as one's self, would not quite suit my spint. Not quite!'
said Cherry, with a spiteful shiver.

<P>`I thought from your saying "at present"' -- Tom observed.

<P>`Really, upon my word! I had no idea you would press me so very closely
on the subject, Mr. Pinch,' said Charity, blushing, `or I should not have
been so foolish as to allude to -- oh really! -- won't you walk in?'

<P>Tom mentioned, to excuse himself, that he had an appointment in Furnival's
Inn, and that coming from Islington he had taken a few wrong turnings,
and arrived at the Monument instead. Miss Pecksniff simpered very much
when he asked her if she knew the way to Furnival's Inn, and at length
found courage to reply.

<P>`A gentleman who is a friend of mine, or at least who is not exactly
a friend so much as a sort of acquaintance -- oh upon my word, I hardly
know what I say, Mr. Pinch. you mustn't suppose there is any engagement
between us; or at least if there is, that it is at all a settled thing
as yet -- is going to Furnival's Inn immediately, I believe upon a little
business, and I am sure he would be very glad to accompany you, so as to
prevent your going wrong again. You had better walk in. You will very likely
find my sister Merry here,' she said with a curious toss of her head, and
anything but an agreeable smile.

<P>`Then, I think, I'll endeavour to find my way alone,' said Tom: `for
I fear she would not be very glad to see me. That unfortunate occurrence,
in relation to which you and I had some amicable words together, in private,
is not likely to have impressed her with any friendly feeling towards me.
Though it really was not my fault.'

<P>`She has never heard of that, you may depend,' said Cherry, gathering
up the corners of her mouth, and nodding at Tom. `I am far from sure that
she would bear you any mighty ill will for it, if she had.'

<P>`You don't say so?' cried Tom, who was really concerned by this insinuation.

<P>`I say nothing,' said Charity. `If I had not already known what shocking
things treachery and deceit are in themselves, Mr. Pinch, I might perhaps
have learnt it from the success they meet with -- from the success they
meet with.' Here she smiled as before. `But I don't say anything. On the
contrary, I should scorn it. You had better walk in!'

<P>There was something hidden here, which piqued Tom's interest and troubled
his tender heart. When, in a moment's irresolution, he looked at Charity,
he could not but observe a struggle in her face between a sense of triumph
and a sense of shame; nor could he but remark how, meeting even his eyes,
which she cared so little for, she turned away her own, for all the splenetic
defiance in her manner.

<P>An uneasy thought entered Tom's head; a shadowy misgiving that the altered
relations between himself and Pecksniff were somehow to involve an altered
knowledge on his part of other people, and were to give him an insight
into much of which he had had no previous suspicion. And yet he put no
definite construction upon Charity's proceedings. He certainly had no idea
that as he had been the audience and spectator of her mortification, she
grasped with eager delight at any opportunity of reproaching her sister
with his presence in <I>her</I> far deeper misery; for he knew nothing
of it, and only pictured that sister as the same giddy, careless, trivial
creature she always had been, with the same slight estimation of himself
which she had never been at the least pains to conceal. In short, he had
merely a confused impression that Miss Pecksniff was not quite sisterly
or kind; and being curious to set it right, accompanied her as she desired.

<P>The house-door being opened, she went in before Tom, requesting him
to follow her. and led the way to the parlour door.

<P>`Oh, Merry!' she said, looking in, `I am so glad you have not gone home.
Who do you think I have met in the street, and brought to see you! Mr.
Pinch! There. Now you <I>are</I> surprised, I am sure!'

<P>Not more surprised than Tom was, when he looked upon her. Not so much.
Not half so much.

<P>`Mr. Pinch has left Papa, my dear,' said Cherry, `and his prospects
are quite flourishing. I have promised that Augustus, who is going that
way, shall escort him to the place he wants. Augustus, my child, where
are you?'

<P>With these words Miss Pecksniff screamed her way out of the parlour,
calling on Augustus Moddle to appear; and left Tom Pinch alone with her
sister.

<P>If she had always been his kindest friend; if she had treated him through
all his servitude with such consideration as was never yet received by
struggling man; if she had lightened every moment of those many years,
and had ever spared and never wounded him; his honest heart could not have
swelled before her with a deeper pity, or a purer freedom from all base
remembrance, than it did then.

<P>`My gracious me! You are really the last person in the world I should
have thought of seeing, I am sure!'

<P>Tom was sorry to hear her speaking in her old manner. He had not expected
that. Yet he did not feel it a contradiction that he should be sorry to
see her so unlike her old self, and sorry at the same time to hear her
speaking in her old manner. The two things seemed quite natural.

<P>`I wonder you find any gratification in coming to see me. I can't think
what put it in your head. I never had much in seeing you. There was no
love lost between us, Mr. Pinch, at any time, I think.'

<P>Her bonnet lay beside her on the sofa, and she was very busy with the
ribbons as she spoke. Much too busy to be conscious of the work her fingers
did.

<P>`We never quarrelled,' said Tom. -- Tom was right in that, for one person
can no more quarrel without an adversary, than one person can play at chess,
or fight a duel. `I hoped you would be glad to shake hands with an old
friend. Don't let us rake up bygones,' said Tom. `If I ever offended you,
forgive me.'

<P>She looked at him for a moment; dropped her bonnet from her hands; spread
them before her altered face, and burst into tears.

<P>`Oh, Mr. Pinch!' she said, `although I never used you well, I did believe
your nature was forgiving. I did not think you could be cruel.'

<P>She spoke as little like her old self now, for certain, as Tom could
possibly have wished. But she seemed to be appealing to him reproachfully,
and he did not understand her.

<P>`I seldom showed it -- never -- I know that. But I had that belief in
you, that if I had been asked to name the person in the world least likely
to retort upon me, I would have named you, confidently.'

<P>`Would have named me!' Tom repeated.

<P>`Yes,' she said with energy, `and I have often thought so.'

<P>After a moment's reflection, Tom sat himself upon a chair beside her.

<P>`Do you believe,' said Tom, `oh, can you think, that what I said just
now, I said with any but the true and plain intention which my words professed?
I mean it, in the spirit and the letter. If I ever offended you, forgive
me; I may have done so, many times. You never injured or offended me. How,
then, could I possibly retort, if even I were stern and bad enough to wish
to do it!'

<P>After a little while she thanked him, through her tears and sobs, and
told him she had never been at once so sorry and so comforted, since she
left home. Still she wept bitterly; and it was the greater pain to Tom
to see her weeping, from her standing in especial need, just then, of sympathy
and tenderness.

<P>`Come, come!' said Tom, `you used to be as cheerful as the day was long.'

<P>`Ah! used!' she cried, in such a tone as rent Tom's heart.

<P>`And will be again,' said Tom.

<P>`No, never more. No, never, never more. If you should talk with old
Mr. Chuzzlewit, at any time,' she added, looking hurriedly into his face
-- `I sometimes thought he liked you, but suppressed it -- will you promise
me to tell him that you saw me here, and that I said I bore in mind the
time we talked together in the churchyard?'

<P>Tom promised that he would.

<P>`Many times since then, when I have wished I had been carried their
before that day, I have recalled his words. I wish that he should know
how true they were, although the least acknowledgment to that effect has
never passed my lips and never will.'

<P>Tom promised this, conditionally too. He did not tell her how improbable
it was that he and the old man would ever meet again, because he thought
it might disturb her more.

<P>`If he should ever know this, through your means, dear Mr. Pinch,' said
Mercy, `tell him that I sent the message, not for myself, but that he might
be more forbearing and more patient, and more trustful to some other person,
in some other time of need. Tell him that if he could know how my heart
trembled in the balance that day, and what a very little would have turned
the scale, his own would bleed with pity for me.'

<P>`Yes, yes,' said Tom, `I will.'

<P>`When I appeared to him the most unworthy of his help, I was -- I know
I was, for I have often, often, thought about it since -- the most inclined
to yield to what he showed me. Oh! if he had relented but a little more;
if he had thrown himself in my way for but one other quarter of an hour;
if he had extended his compassion for a vain, unthinking, miserable girl,
in but the least degree; he might, and I believe he would, have saved her!
Tell him that I don't blame him, but am grateful for the effort that he
made; but ask him for the love of God, and youth, and in merciful consideration
for the struggle which an ill-advised and unwakened nature makes to hide
the strength it thinks its weakness -- ask him never, never, to forget
this, when he deals with one again!'

<P>Although Tom did not hold the clue to her full meaning, he could guess
it pretty nearly. Touched to the quick, he took her hand and said, or meant
to say, some words of consolation. She felt and understood them, whether
they were spoken or no. He was not quite certain, afterwards, but that
she had tried to kneel down at his feet, and bless him.

<P>He found that he was not alone in the room when she had left it. Mrs.
Todgers was there, shaking her head. Tom had never seen Mrs. Todgers, it
is needless to say, but he had a perception of her being the lady of the
house; and he saw some genuine compassion in her eyes, that won his good
opinion.

<P>`Ah, sir! You are an old friend, I see,' said Mrs. Todgers.

<P>`Yes,' said Tom.

<P>`And yet,' quoth Mrs. Todgers, shutting the door softly, `she hasn't
told you what her troubles are, I'm certain.'

<P>Tom was struck by these words, for they were quite true. `Indeed,' he
said, `she has not.'

<P>`And never would,' said Mrs. Todgers, `if you saw her daily. She never
makes the least complaint to me, or utters a single word of explanation
or reproach. But I know,' said Mrs. Todgers, drawing in her breath, `I
know!'

<P>Tom nodded sorrowfully, `so do I.'

<P>`I fully believe,' said Mrs. Todgers, taking her pocket-handkerchief
from the flat reticule, `that nobody can tell one half of what that poor
young creature has to undergo. But though she comes here, constantly, to
ease her poor full heart without his knowing it. and saying, "Mrs. Todgers,
I am very low to-day; I think that I shall soon be dead," sits crying in
my room until the fit is past; I know no more from her. And, I believe,'
said Mrs. Todgers, putting back her handkerchief again, `that she considers
me a good friend too.'

<P>Mrs. Todgers might have said her best friend. Commercial gentlemen and
gravy had tried Mrs. Todgers's temper; the main chance -- it was such a
very small one in her case, that she might have been excused for looking
sharp after it, lest it should entirely vanish from her sight -- had taken
a firm hold on Mrs. Todgers's attention. But in some odd nook in Mrs. Todgers's
breast, up a great many steps, and in a corner easy to be overlooked, there
was a secret door, with `Woman' written on the spring, which, at a touch
from Mercy's hand, had flown wide open, and admitted her for shelter.

<P>When boarding-house accounts are balanced with all other ledgers, and
the books of the Recording Angel are made up for ever, perhaps there may
be seen an entry to thy credit, lean Mrs. Todgers, which shall make thee
beautiful!

<P>She was growing beautiful so rapidly in Tom's eyes; for he saw that
she was poor, and that this good had sprung up in her from among the sordid
strivings of her life; that she might have been a very Venus in a minute
more, if Miss Pecksniff had not entered with her friend.

<P>`Mr. Thomas Pinch!' said Charity, performing the ceremony of introduction
with evident pride. `Mr. Moddle. Where's my sister?'

<P>`Gone, Miss Pecksniff,' Mrs. Todgers answered. `She had appointed to
be home.'

<P>`Ah!' said Charity, looking at Tom. `Oh, dear me!'

<P>`She's greatly altered since she's been Anoth -- since she's been married,
Mrs. Todgers!' observed Moddle.

<P>`My dear Augustus!' said Miss Pecksniff, in a low voice. `I verily believe
you have said that fifty thousand times, in my hearing. What a Prose you
are!'

<P>This was succeeded by some trifling love passages, which appeared to
originate with, if not to be wholly carried on by Miss Pecksniff. At any
rate, Mr. Moddle was much slower in his responses than is customary with
young lovers, and exhibited a lowness of spirits which was quite oppressive.

<P>He did not improve at all when Tom and he were in the streets, but sighed
so dismally that it was dreadful to hear him. As a means of cheering him
up, Tom told him that he wished him joy.

<P>`Joy!' cried Moddle. `Ha, ha!'

<P>`What an extraordinary young man!' thought Tom.

<P>`The Scorner has not set his seal upon you. You care what becomes of
you?' said Moddle.

<P>Tom admitted that it was a subject in which he certainly felt some interest.

<P>`I don't,' said Mr. Moddle. `The Elements may have me when they please.
I'm ready.'

<P>Tom inferred from these, and other expressions of the same nature, that
he was jealous. Therefore he allowed him to take his own course; which
was such a gloomy one, that he felt a load removed from his mind when they
parted company at the gate of Furnival's Inn.

<P>It was now a couple of hours past John Westlock's dinner-time; and he
was walking up and down the room, quite anxious for Tom's safety. The table
was spread; the wine was carefully decanted; and the dinner smelt delicious.

<P>`Why, Tom, old boy, where on earth have you been? Your box is here.
Get your boots off instantly, and sit down!'

<P>`I am sorry to say I can't stay, John,' replied Tom Pinch, who was breathless
with the haste he had made in running up the stairs.

<P>`Can't stay!'

<P>`If you'll go on with your dinner,' said Tom, `I'll tell you my reason
the while. I mustn't eat myself, or I shall have no appetite for the chops.'

<P>`There are no chops here, my food fellow.'

<P>`No. But there are at Islington,' said Tom.

<P>John Westlock was perfectly confounded by this reply, and vowed he would
not touch a morsel until Tom had explained himself fully. So Tom sat down,
and told him all; to which he listened with the greatest interest.

<P>He knew Tom too well, and respected his delicacy too much, to ask him
why he had taken these measures without communicating with him first. He
quite concurred in the expediency of Tom's immediately returning to his
sister, as he knew so little of the place. in which he had left her, and
good-humouredly proposed to ride back with him in a cab, in which he might
convey his box. Tom's proposition that he should sup with them that night,
he flatly rejected, but made an appointment with him for the morrow. `And
now Tom,' he said, as they rode along, `I have a question to ask you to
which I expect a manly and straightforward answer. Do you want any money?
I am pretty sure you do.'

<P>`I don't indeed,' said Tom.

<P>`I believe you are deceiving me.'

<P>`No. With many thanks to you, I am quite in earnest,' Tom replied. `My
sister has some money, and so have I. If I had nothing else, John, I have
a five-pound note, which that good creature, Mrs. Lupin, of the Dragon,
handed up to me outside the coach, in a letter begging me to borrow it;
and then drove off as hard as she could go.'

<P>`And a blessing on every dimple in her handsome face, say I!' cried
John, `though why you should give her the preference over me, I don't know.
Never mind. I bide my time, Tom.'

<P>`And I hope you'll continue to bide it,' returned Tom, gaily. `For I
owe you more, already, in a hundred other ways, than I can ever hope to
pay.'

<P>They parted at the door of Tom's new residence. John Westlock, sitting
in the cab, and, catching a glimpse of a blooming little busy creature
darting out to kiss Tom and to help him with his box, would not have had
the least objection to change places with him.

<P>Well! she <I>was</I> a cheerful little thing; and had a quaint, bright
quietness about her that was infinitely pleasant. Surely she was the best
sauce for chops ever invented. The potatoes seemed to take a pleasure in
sending up their grateful steam before her; the froth upon the pint of
porter pouted to attract her notice. But it was all in vain. She saw nothing
but Tom. Tom was the first and last thing in the world.

<P>As she sat opposite to Tom at supper, fingering one of Tom's pet tunes
upon the table-cloth, and smiling in his face, he had never been so happy
in his life.
