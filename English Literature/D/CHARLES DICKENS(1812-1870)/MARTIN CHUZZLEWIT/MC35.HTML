<P>T<FONT SIZE=-1>HE LAWS OF SYMPATHY BETWEEN BEARDS</FONT> and birds,
and the secret source of that attraction which frequently impels a shaver
of the one to be a dealer in the other, are questions for the subtle reasoning
of scientific bodies: not the less so, because their investigation would
seem calculated to lead to no particular result. It is enough to know that
the artist who had the honour of entertaining Mrs. Gamp as his first-floor
lodger, united the two pursuits of barbering and bird-fancying; and that
it was not an original idea of his, but one in which he had, dispersed
about the by-streets and suburbs of the town, a host of rivals.

<P>The name of the householder was Paul Sweedlepipe. But he was commonly
called Poll Sweedlepipe: and was not uncommonly believed to have been so
christened, among his friends and neighbours.

<P>With the exception of the staircase, and his lodger's private apartment,
Poll Sweedlepipe's house was one great bird's nest. Gamecocks resided in
the kitchen; pheasants wasted the brightness of their golden plumage on
the garret; bantams roosted in the cellar; owls had possession of the bedroom;
and specimens of all the smaller fry of birds chirrupped and twittered
in the shop. The staircase was sacred to rabbits. There in hutches of all
shapes and kinds, made from old packing-cases, boxes, drawers, and tea-chests,
they increased in a prodigious degree, and contributed their share towards
that complicated whiff which, quite impartially, and without distinction
of persons, saluted every nose that was put into Sweedlepipe's easy shaving-shop.

<P>Many noses found their way there, for all that, especially on Sunday
morning, before church-time. Even archbishops shave, or must be shaved,
on a Sunday, and beards <I>will</I> grow after twelve o'clock on Saturday
night, though it be upon the chins of base mechanics: who, not being able
to engage their valets by the quarter, hire them by the job, and pay them--oh,
the wickedness of copper coin!--in dirty pence. Poll Sweedlepipe, the sinner,
shaved all comers at a penny each, and cut the hair of any customer for
twopence; and being a lone unmarried man, and having some connexion in
the bird line, Poll got on tolerably well.

<P>He was a little elderly man, with a clammy cold right hand, from which
even rabbits and birds could not remove the smell of shaving-soap. Poll
had something of the bird in his nature. not of the hawk or eagle, but
of the sparrow, that builds in chimney-stacks and inclines to human company.
He was not quarrelsome, though, like the sparrow; but peaceful, like the
dove. In his walk he strutted; and, in this respect, he bore a faint resemblance
to the pigeon, as well as in a certain prosiness of speech, which might,
in its monotony, be likened to the cooing of that bird. He was very inquisitive;
and when he stood at his shop-door in the evening-tide, watching the neighbours,
with his head on one side, and his eye cocked knowingly, there was a dash
of the raven in him. Yet there was no more wickedness in Poll than in a
robin. Happily, too, when any of his ornithological properties were on
the verge of going too far, they were quenched, dissolved, melted down,
and neutralised in the barber just as his bald head--otherwise, as the
head of a shaved magpie--lost itself in a wig of curly black ringlets,
parted on one side, and cut away almost to the crown, to indicate immense
capacity of intellect.

<P>Poll had a very small, shrill treble voice, which might have led the
wags of Kingsgate Street to insist the more upon his feminine designation.
He had a tender heart, too; for, when he had a good commission to provide
three or four score sparrows for a shooting-match, he would observe, in
a compassionate tone, how singular it was that sparrows should have been
made expressly for such purposes. The question, whether men were made to
shoot them, never entered into Poll's philosophy.

<P>Poll wore in his sporting character, a velveteen coat, a great deal
of blue stocking, ankle boots, a neckerchief of some bright colour, and
a very tall hat. Pursuing his more quiet occupation of barber, he generally
subsided into an apron not over-clean, a flannel jacket, and corduroy knee-shorts.
It was in this latter costume, but with his apron girded round his waist,
as a token of his having shut up shop for the night, that he closed the
door one evening, some weeks after the occurrences detailed in the last
chapter, and stood upon the steps in Kingsgate Street, listening until
the little cracked bell within should leave off ringing. For until it did--this
was Mr. Sweedlepipe's reflection--the place never seemed quiet enough to
be left to itself.

<P>`It's the greediest little bell to ring,' said Poll, `that ever was.
But it's quiet at last.'

<P>He rolled his apron up a little tighter as he said these words, and
hastened down the street. Just as he was turning into Holborn, he ran against
a young gentleman in a livery. This youth was bold, though small, and with
several lively expressions of displeasure, turned upon him instantly.

<P>`Now, Stoo-pid!' cried the young gentleman. `Can't you look where you're
a-going to--eh? Can't you mind where you're a-coming to--eh? What do you
think your eyes was made for--eh? Ah! Yes. oh! Now then!'

<P>The young gentleman pronounced the two last words in a very loud tone
and with frightful emphasis, as though they contamed within themselves
the essence of the direst aggravation. But he had scarcely done so, when
his anger yielded to surprise, and he cried, in a milder tone:

<P>`What! Polly!'

<P>`Why, it ain't you, sure!' cried Poll. `It can't be you!'

<P>`No. It ain't me,' returned the youth. `It's my son, my oldest one.
He's a credit to his father, ain't he, Polly?' With this delicate little
piece of banter, he halted on the pavement, and went round and round in
circles, for the better exhibition of his figure: rather to the inconvenience
of the passengers generally, who were not in an equal state of spirits
with himself.

<P>`I wouldn't have believed it,' said Poll. `What! You've left your old
place, then? Have you?'

<P>`Have I!' returned his young friend, who had by this time stuck his
hands into the pockets of his white cord breeches, and was swaggering along
at the barber's side. `D'ye know a pair of top-boots when you see 'em,
Polly? Look here!'

<P>`Beau-ti-ful' cried Mr. Sweedlepipe.

<P>`D'ye know a slap-up sort of button, when you see it?' said the youth.
`Don't look at mine, if you ain't a judge, because these lions" heads was
made for men of taste: not snobs.'

<P>`Beau-ti-ful!' cried the barber again. `A grass-green frock-coat, too,
bound with gold! And a cockade in your hat!'

<P>`I should hope so,' replied the youth. `Blow the cockade, though; for,
except that it don't turn round, it's like the wentilator that used to
be in the kitchen winder at Todgers's. You ain't seen the old lady's name
in the Gazette, have you?'

<P>`No,' returned the barber. `Is she a bankrupt?'

<P>`If she ain't, she will be,' retorted Bailey. `That bis'ness never can
be carried on without <I>me</I>. Well! How are you?'

<P>`Oh! I'm pretty well,' said Poll. `Are you living at this end of the
town, or were you coming to see me? Was that the bis'ness that brought
you to Holborn?'

<P>`I haven't got no bis'ness in Holborn,' returned Bailey, with some displeasure.
`All my bis'ness lays at the West-end. I've got the right sort of governor
now. You can't see his face for his whiskers, and can't see his whiskers
for the dye upon 'em. That's a gentleman ain't it? You wouldn't like a
ride in a cab, would you? Why, it wouldn't be safe to offer it. You'd faint
away, only to see me a-comin' at a mild trot round the corner.'

<P>To convey a slight idea of the effect of this approach, Mr. Bailey counterfeited
in his own person the action of a high-trotting horse and threw up his
head so high, in backing against a pump, that he shook his hat off.

<P>`Why, he's own uncle to Capricorn,' said Bailey, `and brother to Cauliflower.
He's been through the winders of two chaney shops since we've had him,
and wos sold for killin' his missis. That's a horse, I hope?'

<P>`Ah! you'll never want to buy any more red-polls, now,' observed Poll,
looking on his young friend with an air of melancholy. `You'll never want
to buy any more red-polls now, to hang up over the sink, will you?'

<P>`I should think not,' replied Bailey. `Reether so. I wouldn't have nothin'
to say to any bird below a Peacock. and <I>he</I>'d be wulgar. Well, how
are you?'

<P>`Oh! I'm pretty well,' said Poll. He answered the question again because
Mr. Bailey asked it again; Mr. Bailey asked it again, because--accompanied
with a straddling action of the white cords, a bend of the knees, and a
striking forth of the top-boots--it was an easy horse-fleshy, turfy sort
of thing to do.

<P>`Wot are you up to, old feller?' added Mr. Bailey, with the same graceful
rakishness. He was quite the man-about-town of the conversation, while
the easy-shaver was the child.

<P>`Why, I am going to fetch my lodger home,' said Paul.

<P>`A woman!' cried Mr. Bailey, `for a twenty-pun' note!'

<P>The little barber hastened to explain that she was neither a young woman,
nor a handsome woman, but a nurse, who had been acting as a kind of house-keeper
to a gentleman for some weeks past, and left her place that night, in consequence
of being superseded by another and a more legitimate house-keeper: to wit,
the gentleman's bride.

<P>`He's newly married, and he brings his young wife home to-night,' said
the barber. `So I'm going to fetch my lodger away--Mr. Chuzzlewit's, close
behind the Post Office--and carry her box for her.'

<P>`Jonas Chuzzlewit's?' said Bailey.

<P>`Ah!' returned Paul: `that's the name sure enough. Do you know him?'

<P>`Oh, no!' cried Mr. Bailey; `not at all. And I don't know her! Not neither!
Why, they first kept company through me, a'most.'

<P>`Ah?' said Paul.

<P>`Ah!' said Mr. Bailey, with a wink; `and she ain't bad-looking mind
you. But her sister was the best. <I>She</I> was the merry one. I often
used to have a bit of fun with her, in the hold times!'

<P>Mr. Bailey spoke as if he already had a leg and three-quarters in the
grave and this had happened twenty or thirty years ago. Paul Sweedlepipe,
the meek, was so perfectly confounded by his precocious self-possession,
and his patronising manner, as well as by his boots, cockade, and livery,
that a mist swam before his eyes, and he saw--not the Bailey of acknowledged
juvenility, from Todgers's Commercial Boarding House, who had made his
acquaintance within a twelvemonth, by purchasing, at sundry times, small
birds at twopence each--but a highly-condensed embodiment of all the sporting
grooms in London; an abstract of all the stable-knowledge of the time;
a something at a high-pressure that must have had existence many years,
and was fraught with terrible experiences. And truly, though in the cloudy
atmosphere of Todgers's, Mr. Bailey's genius had ever shone out brightly
in this particular respect, it now eclipsed both time and space, cheated
beholders of their senses, and worked on their belief in defiance of all
natural laws. He walked along the tangible and real stones of Holborn Hill,
an under-sized boy; and yet he winked the winks, and thought the thoughts,
and did the deeds, and said the sayings of an ancient man. There was an
old principle within him, and a young surface without. He became an inexplicable
creature a breeched and booted Sphinx. There was no course open to the
barber, but to go distracted himself, or to take Bailey for granted and
he wisely chose the latter.

<P>Mr. Bailey was good enough to continue to bear him company, and to entertain
him, as they went, with easy conversation on various sporting topics. especially
on the comparative merits, as a general principle, of horses with white
stockings, and horses without. In regard to the style of tail to be preferred,
Mr. Bailey had opinions of his own, which he explained, but begged they
might by no means influence his friend's, as here he knew he had the misfortune
to differ from some excellent authorities. He treated Mr. Sweedlepipe to
a dram, compounded agreeably to his own directions, which he informed him
had been invented by a member of the Jockey Club; and, as they were by
this time near the barber's destination, he observed that, as he had an
hour to spare, and knew the parties, he would, if quite agreeable, be introduced
to Mrs. Gamp.

<P>Paul knocked at Jonas Chuzzlewit's: and, on the door being opened by
that lady, made the two distinguished persons known to one another. It
was a happy feature in Mrs. Gamp's twofold profession, that it gave her
an interest in everything that was young as well as in everything that
was old. She received Mr. Bailey with much kindness.

<P>`It's very good, I'm sure, of you to come, she said to her an or `as
well as bring so nice a friend. But I'm afraid that I must trouble you
so far as to step in, for the young couple has not yet made appearance.'

<P>`They're late, ain't they?' inquired her landlord, when she had conducted
them down-stairs into the kitchen.

<P>`Well, sir, considern' the Wings of Love, they are,' said Mrs. Gamp.

<P>Mr. Bailey inquired whether the Wings of Love had ever won a plate,
or could be backed to do anything remarkable; and being informed that it
was not a horse, but merely a poetical or figurative expression, evinced
considerable disgust. Mrs. Gamp was so very much astonished by his affable
manners and great ease, that she was about to propound to her landlord
in a whisper the staggering inquiry, whether he was a man or a boy, when
Mr. Sweedlepipe, anticipating her design, made a timely diversion.

<P>`He knows Mrs. Chuzzlewit,' said Paul aloud.

<P>`There's nothin' he don't know; that's my opinion,' observed Mrs. Gamp.
`All the wickedness of the world is Print to him.'

<P>Mr. Bailey received this as a compliment, and said, adjusting his cravat,
`reether so.'

<P>`As you knows Mrs. Chuzzlewit, you knows, p'raps, what her chris'n name
is?' Mrs. Gamp observed.

<P>`Charity,' said Bailey.

<P>`That it ain't!' cried Mrs. Gamp.

<P>`Cherry, then,' said Bailey. `Cherry's short for it. It's all the same.'

<P>`It don't begin with a C at all,' retorted Mrs. Gamp, shaking her head.
`It begins with a M.'

<P>`Whew!' cried Mr. Bailey, slapping a little cloud of pipe-clay out of
his left leg, `then he's been and married the merry one!'

<P>As these words were mysterious, Mrs. Gamp called upon him to explain,
which Mr. Bailey proceeded to do: that lady listening greedily to everything
he said. He was yet in the fulness of his narrative when the sound of wheels,
and a double knock at the street door, announced the arrival of the newly-married
couple. Begging him to reserve what more he had to say, for her hearing
on the way home, Mrs. Gamp took up the candle, and hurried away to receive
and welcome the young mistress of the house.

<P>`Wishing you appiness and joy with all my art,' said Mrs. Gamp, dropping
a curtsey as they entered the hall; `and you, too, sir. Your lady looks
a little tired with the journey, Mr. Chuzzlewit, a pretty dear!'

<P>`She has bothered enough about it,' grumbled Mr. Jonas. `Now, show a
light, will you?'

<P>`This way, ma'am, if you please,' said Mrs. Gamp, going upstairs before
them. `Things has been made as comfortable as they could be, but there's
many things you'll have to alter your own self when you gets time to look
about you! Ah! sweet thing! But you don't,' added Mrs. Gamp, internally,
`you don't look much like a merry one, I must say!'

<P>It was true: she did not. The death that had gone before the bridal
seemed to have left its shade upon the house. The air was heavy and oppressive;
the rooms were dark; a deep gloom filled up every chink and corner. Upon
the hearthstone, like a creature of ill omen, sat the aged clerk, with
his eyes fixed on some withered branches in the stove. He rose and looked
at her.

<P>`So there you are, Mr. Chuff,' said Jonas carelessly, as he dusted his
boots: `still in the land of the living, eh?'

<P>`Still in the land of the living, sir,' retorted Mrs. Gamp. `And Mr.
Chuffey may thank you for it, as many and many a time I've told him.'

<P>Mr. Jonas was not in the best of humours, for he merely said, as he
looked round, `We don't want you any more, you know, Mrs. Gamp.'

<P>`I'm a-going immediate, sir,' returned the nurse; `unless there's nothink
I can do for you, ma'am. Ain't there,' said Mrs. Gamp, with a look of great
sweetness, and rummaging all the time in her pocket; `ain't there nothink
I can do for you, my little bird?'

<P>`No,' said Merry, almost crying. `You had better go away, please!'

<P>With a leer of mingled sweetness and slyness; with one eye on the future,
one on the bride, and an arch expression in her face, partly spiritual,
partly spirituous, and wholly professional and peculiar to her art; Mrs.
Gamp rummaged in her pocket again, and took from it a printed card, whereon
was an inscription copied from her sign-board.

<P>`Would you be so good, my darling dovey of a dear young married lady,'
Mrs. Gamp observed, in a low voice, `as put that some-whereas where you
can keep it in your mind? I'm well beknown to many ladies, and it's my
card. Gamp is my name, and Gamp my nater. Livin' quite handy, I will make
so bold as call in now and then, and make inquiry how your health and spirits
is, my precious chick!'

<P>And with innumerable leers, winks, coughs, nods, smiles, and curtseys,
all leading to the establishment of a mysterious and confidential understanding
between herself and the bride, Mrs. Gamp, invoking a blessing upon the
house, leered, winked, coughed, nodded, smiled, and curtseyed herself out
of the room.

<P>`But I will say, and I would if I was led a Martha to the Stakes for
it,' Mrs. Gamp remarked below stairs, in a whisper, `that she don't look
much like a merry one at this present moment of time.'

<P>`Ah! wait till you hear her laugh!' said Bailey.

<P>`Hem!' cried Mrs. Gamp, in a kind of groan. `I will, child.'

<P>They said no more in the house, for Mrs. Gamp put on her bonnet, Mr.
Sweedlepipe took up her box; and Mr. Bailey accompanied them towards Kingsgate
Street; recounting to Mrs. Gamp as they went along, the origin and progress
of his acquaintance with Mrs. Chuzzlewit and her sister. It was a pleasant
instance of this youth's precocity, that he fancied Mrs. Gamp had conceived
a tenderness for him, and was much tickled by her misplaced attachment.

<P>As the door closed heavily behind them, Mrs. Jonas sat down in a chair,
and felt a strange chill creep upon her, whilst she looked about the room.
It was pretty much as she had known it, but appeared more dreary. She had
thought to see it brightened to receive her.

<P>`It ain't good enough for you, I suppose?' said Jonas, watching her
looks.

<P>`Why, it <I>is</I> dull,' said Merry, trying to be more herself.

<P>`It'll be duller before you're done with it,' retorted Jonas, `if you
give me any of your airs. You're a nice article, to turn sulky on first
coming home! Ecod, you used to have life enough, when you could plague
me with it. The gal's down-stairs. Ring the bell for supper, while I take
my boots off!'

<P>She roused herself from looking after him as he left the room, to do
what he had desired: when the old man Chuffey laid his hand softly on her
arm.

<P>`You are not married?' he said eagerly. `Not married?'

<P>`Yes. A month ago. Good Heaven, what is the matter?'

<P>He answered nothing was the matter; and turned from her. But in her
fear and wonder, turning also, she saw him raise his trembling hands above
his head, and heard him say:

<P>`Oh! woe, woe, woe, upon this wicked house!'

<P>It was her welcome,--H<FONT SIZE=-1>OME</FONT>.
