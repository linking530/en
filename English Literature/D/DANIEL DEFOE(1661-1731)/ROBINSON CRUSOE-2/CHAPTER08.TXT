IT now came into my thoughts that I had hinted to my friend the 

clergyman that the work of converting the savages might perhaps be 

set on foot in his absence to his satisfaction, and I told him that 

now I thought that it was put in a fair way; for the savages, being 

thus divided among the Christians, if they would but every one of 

them do their part with those which came under their hands, I hoped 

it might have a very good effect.



He agreed presently in that, if they did their part.  "But how," 

says he, "shall we obtain that of them?"  I told him we would call 

them all together, and leave it in charge with them, or go to them, 

one by one, which he thought best; so we divided it - he to speak 

to the Spaniards, who were all Papists, and I to speak to the 

English, who were all Protestants; and we recommended it earnestly 

to them, and made them promise that they would never make any 

distinction of Papist or Protestant in their exhorting the savages 

to turn Christians, but teach them the general knowledge of the 

true God, and of their Saviour Jesus Christ; and they likewise 

promised us that they would never have any differences or disputes 

one with another about religion.



When I came to Will Atkins's house, I found that the young woman I 

have mentioned above, and Will Atkins's wife, were become 

intimates; and this prudent, religious young woman had perfected 

the work Will Atkins had begun; and though it was not above four 

days after what I have related, yet the new-baptized savage woman 

was made such a Christian as I have seldom heard of in all my 

observation or conversation in the world.  It came next into my 

mind, in the morning before I went to them, that amongst all the 

needful things I had to leave with them I had not left them a 

Bible, in which I showed myself less considering for them than my 

good friend the widow was for me when she sent me the cargo of a 

hundred pounds from Lisbon, where she packed up three Bibles and a 

Prayer-book.  However, the good woman's charity had a greater 

extent than ever she imagined, for they were reserved for the 

comfort and instruction of those that made much better use of them 

than I had done.



I took one of the Bibles in my pocket, and when I came to Will 

Atkins's tent, or house, and found the young woman and Atkins's 

baptized wife had been discoursing of religion together - for Will 

Atkins told it me with a great deal of joy - I asked if they were 

together now, and he said, "Yes"; so I went into the house, and he 

with me, and we found them together very earnest in discourse.  

"Oh, sir," says Will Atkins, "when God has sinners to reconcile to 

Himself, and aliens to bring home, He never wants a messenger; my 

wife has got a new instructor:  I knew I was unworthy, as I was 

incapable of that work; that young woman has been sent hither from 

heaven - she is enough to convert a whole island of savages."  The 

young woman blushed, and rose up to go away, but I desired her to 

sit-still; I told her she had a good work upon her hands, and I 

hoped God would bless her in it.



We talked a little, and I did not perceive that they had any book 

among them, though I did not ask; but I put my hand into my pocket, 

and pulled out my Bible.  "Here," said I to Atkins, "I have brought 

you an assistant that perhaps you had not before."  The man was so 

confounded that he was not able to speak for some time; but, 

recovering himself, he takes it with both his hands, and turning to 

his wife, "Here, my dear," says he, "did not I tell you our God, 

though He lives above, could hear what we have said?  Here's the 

book I prayed for when you and I kneeled down under the bush; now 

God has heard us and sent it."  When he had said so, the man fell 

into such passionate transports, that between the joy of having it, 

and giving God thanks for it, the tears ran down his face like a 

child that was crying.



The woman was surprised, and was like to have run into a mistake 

that none of us were aware of; for she firmly believed God had sent 

the book upon her husband's petition.  It is true that 

providentially it was so, and might be taken so in a consequent 

sense; but I believe it would have been no difficult matter at that 

time to have persuaded the poor woman to have believed that an 

express messenger came from heaven on purpose to bring that 

individual book.  But it was too serious a matter to suffer any 

delusion to take place, so I turned to the young woman, and told 

her we did not desire to impose upon the new convert in her first 

and more ignorant understanding of things, and begged her to 

explain to her that God may be very properly said to answer our 

petitions, when, in the course of His providence, such things are 

in a particular manner brought to pass as we petitioned for; but we 

did not expect returns from heaven in a miraculous and particular 

manner, and it is a mercy that it is not so.



This the young woman did afterwards effectually, so that there was 

no priestcraft used here; and I should have thought it one of the 

most unjustifiable frauds in the world to have had it so.  But the 

effect upon Will Atkins is really not to be expressed; and there, 

we may be sure, was no delusion.  Sure no man was ever more 

thankful in the world for anything of its kind than he was for the 

Bible, nor, I believe, never any man was glad of a Bible from a 

better principle; and though he had been a most profligate 

creature, headstrong, furious, and desperately wicked, yet this man 

is a standing rule to us all for the well instructing children, 

viz. that parents should never give over to teach and instruct, nor 

ever despair of the success of their endeavours, let the children 

be ever so refractory, or to appearance insensible to instruction; 

for if ever God in His providence touches the conscience of such, 

the force of their education turns upon them, and the early 

instruction of parents is not lost, though it may have been many 

years laid asleep, but some time or other they may find the benefit 

of it.  Thus it was with this poor man:  however ignorant he was of 

religion and Christian knowledge, he found he had some to do with 

now more ignorant than himself, and that the least part of the 

instruction of his good father that now came to his mind was of use 

to him.



Among the rest, it occurred to him, he said, how his father used to 

insist so much on the inexpressible value of the Bible, and the 

privilege and blessing of it to nations, families, and persons; but 

he never entertained the least notion of the worth of it till now, 

when, being to talk to heathens, savages, and barbarians, he wanted 

the help of the written oracle for his assistance.  The young woman 

was glad of it also for the present occasion, though she had one, 

and so had the youth, on board our ship among their goods, which 

were not yet brought on shore.  And now, having said so many things 

of this young woman, I cannot omit telling one story more of her 

and myself, which has something in it very instructive and 

remarkable.



I have related to what extremity the poor young woman was reduced; 

how her mistress was starved to death, and died on board that 

unhappy ship we met at sea, and how the whole ship's company was 

reduced to the last extremity.  The gentlewoman, and her son, and 

this maid, were first hardly used as to provisions, and at last 

totally neglected and starved - that is to say, brought to the last 

extremity of hunger.  One day, being discoursing with her on the 

extremities they suffered, I asked her if she could describe, by 

what she had felt, what it was to starve, and how it appeared?  She 

said she believed she could, and told her tale very distinctly 

thus:-



"First, we had for some days fared exceedingly hard, and suffered 

very great hunger; but at last we were wholly without food of any 

kind except sugar, and a little wine and water.  The first day 

after I had received no food at all, I found myself towards 

evening, empty and sick at the stomach, and nearer night much 

inclined to yawning and sleep.  I lay down on the couch in the 

great cabin to sleep, and slept about three hours, and awaked a 

little refreshed, having taken a glass of wine when I lay down; 

after being about three hours awake, it being about five o'clock in 

the morning, I found myself empty, and my stomach sickish, and lay 

down again, but could not sleep at all, being very faint and ill; 

and thus I continued all the second day with a strange variety - 

first hungry, then sick again, with retchings to vomit.  The second 

night, being obliged to go to bed again without any food more than 

a draught of fresh water, and being asleep, I dreamed I was at 

Barbadoes, and that the market was mightily stocked with 

provisions; that I bought some for my mistress, and went and dined 

very heartily.  I thought my stomach was full after this, as it 

would have been after a good dinner; but when I awaked I was 

exceedingly sunk in my spirits to find myself in the extremity of 

family.  The last glass of wine we had I drank, and put sugar in 

it, because of its having some spirit to supply nourishment; but 

there being no substance in the stomach for the digesting office to 

work upon, I found the only effect of the wine was to raise 

disagreeable fumes from the stomach into the head; and I lay, as 

they told me, stupid and senseless, as one drunk, for some time.  

The third day, in the morning, after a night of strange, confused, 

and inconsistent dreams, and rather dozing than sleeping, I awaked 

ravenous and furious with hunger; and I question, had not my 

understanding returned and conquered it, whether if I had been a 

mother, and had had a little child with me, its life would have 

been safe or not.  This lasted about three hours, during which time 

I was twice raging mad as any creature in Bedlam, as my young 

master told me, and as he can now inform you.



"In one of these fits of lunacy or distraction I fell down and 

struck my face against the corner of a pallet-bed, in which my 

mistress lay, and with the blow the blood gushed out of my nose; 

and the cabin-boy bringing me a little basin, I sat down and bled 

into it a great deal; and as the blood came from me I came to 

myself, and the violence of the flame or fever I was in abated, and 

so did the ravenous part of the hunger.  Then I grew sick, and 

retched to vomit, but could not, for I had nothing in my stomach to 

bring up.  After I had bled some time I swooned, and they all 

believed I was dead; but I came to myself soon after, and then had 

a most dreadful pain in my stomach not to be described - not like 

the colic, but a gnawing, eager pain for food; and towards night it 

went off with a kind of earnest wishing or longing for food.  I 

took another draught of water with sugar in it; but my stomach 

loathed the sugar and brought it all up again; then I took a 

draught of water without sugar, and that stayed with me; and I laid 

me down upon the bed, praying most heartily that it would please 

God to take me away; and composing my mind in hopes of it, I 

slumbered a while, and then waking, thought myself dying, being 

light with vapours from an empty stomach.  I recommended my soul 

then to God, and then earnestly wished that somebody would throw me 

into the into the sea.



"All this while my mistress lay by me, just, as I thought, 

expiring, but she bore it with much more patience than I, and gave 

the last bit of bread she had left to her child, my young master, 

who would not have taken it, but she obliged him to eat it; and I 

believe it saved his life.  Towards the morning I slept again, and 

when I awoke I fell into a violent passion of crying, and after 

that had a second fit of violent hunger.  I got up ravenous, and in 

a most dreadful condition; and once or twice I was going to bite my 

own arm.  At last I saw the basin in which was the blood I had bled 

at my nose the day before:  I ran to it, and swallowed it with such 

haste, and such a greedy appetite, as if I wondered nobody had 

taken it before, and afraid it should be taken from me now.  After 

it was down, though the thoughts of it filled me with horror, yet 

it checked the fit of hunger, and I took another draught of water, 

and was composed and refreshed for some hours after.  This was the 

fourth day; and this I kept up till towards night, when, within the 

compass of three hours, I had all the several circumstances over 

again, one after another, viz. sick, sleepy, eagerly hungry, pain 

in the stomach, then ravenous again, then sick, then lunatic, then 

crying, then ravenous again, and so every quarter of an hour, and 

my strength wasted exceedingly; at night I lay me down, having no 

comfort but in the hope that I should die before morning.



"All this night I had no sleep; but the hunger was now turned into 

a disease; and I had a terrible colic and griping, by wind instead 

of food having found its way into the bowels; and in this condition 

I lay till morning, when I was surprised by the cries and 

lamentations of my young master, who called out to me that his 

mother was dead.  I lifted myself up a little, for I had not 

strength to rise, but found she was not dead, though she was able 

to give very little signs of life.  I had then such convulsions in 

my stomach, for want of some sustenance, as I cannot describe; with 

such frequent throes and pangs of appetite as nothing but the 

tortures of death can imitate; and in this condition I was when I 

heard the seamen above cry out, 'A sail! a sail!' and halloo and 

jump about as if they were distracted.  I was not able to get off 

from the bed, and my mistress much less; and my young master was so 

sick that I thought he had been expiring; so we could not open the 

cabin door, or get any account what it was that occasioned such 

confusion; nor had we had any conversation with the ship's company 

for twelve days, they having told us that they had not a mouthful 

of anything to eat in the ship; and this they told us afterwards - 

they thought we had been dead.  It was this dreadful condition we 

were in when you were sent to save our lives; and how you found us, 

sir, you know as well as I, and better too."



This was her own relation, and is such a distinct account of 

starving to death, as, I confess, I never met with, and was 

exceeding instructive to me.  I am the rather apt to believe it to 

be a true account, because the youth gave me an account of a good 

part of it; though I must own, not so distinct and so feeling as 

the maid; and the rather, because it seems his mother fed him at 

the price of her own life:  but the poor maid, whose constitution 

was stronger than that of her mistress, who was in years, and a 

weakly woman too, might struggle harder with it; nevertheless she 

might be supposed to feel the extremity something sooner than her 

mistress, who might be allowed to keep the last bit something 

longer than she parted with any to relieve her maid.  No question, 

as the case is here related, if our ship or some other had not so 

providentially met them, but a few days more would have ended all 

their lives.  I now return to my disposition of things among the 

people.  And, first, it is to be observed here, that for many 

reasons I did not think fit to let them know anything of the sloop 

I had framed, and which I thought of setting up among them; for I 

found, at least at my first coming, such seeds of division among 

them, that I saw plainly, had I set up the sloop, and left it among 

them, they would, upon every light disgust, have separated, and 

gone away from one another; or perhaps have turned pirates, and so 

made the island a den of thieves, instead of a plantation of sober 

and religious people, as I intended it; nor did I leave the two 

pieces of brass cannon that I had on board, or the extra two 

quarter-deck guns that my nephew had provided, for the same reason.  

I thought it was enough to qualify them for a defensive war against 

any that should invade them, but not to set them up for an 

offensive war, or to go abroad to attack others; which, in the end, 

would only bring ruin and destruction upon them.  I reserved the 

sloop, therefore, and the guns, for their service another way, as I 

shall observe in its place.



Having now done with the island, I left them all in good 

circumstances and in a flourishing condition, and went on board my 

ship again on the 6th of May, having been about twenty-five days 

among them:  and as they were all resolved to stay upon the island 

till I came to remove them, I promised to send them further relief 

from the Brazils, if I could possibly find an opportunity.  I 

particularly promised to send them some cattle, such as sheep, 

hogs, and cows:  as to the two cows and calves which I brought from 

England, we had been obliged, by the length of our voyage, to kill 

them at sea, for want of hay to feed them.



The next day, giving them a salute of five guns at parting, we set 

sail, and arrived at the bay of All Saints in the Brazils in about 

twenty-two days, meeting nothing remarkable in our passage but 

this:  that about three days after we had sailed, being becalmed, 

and the current  setting strong to the ENE., running, as it were, 

into a bay or gulf on the land side, we were driven something out 

of our course, and once or twice our men cried out, "Land to the 

eastward!" but whether it was the continent or islands we could not 

tell by any means.  But the third day, towards evening, the sea 

smooth, and the weather calm, we saw the sea as it were covered 

towards the land with something very black; not being able to 

discover what it was till after some time, our chief mate, going up 

the main shrouds a little way, and looking at them with a 

perspective, cried out it was an army.  I could not imagine what he 

meant by an army, and thwarted him a little hastily.  "Nay, sir," 

says he, "don't be angry, for 'tis an army, and a fleet too:  for I 

believe there are a thousand canoes, and you may see them paddle 

along, for they are coming towards us apace."



I was a little surprised then, indeed, and so was my nephew the 

captain; for he had heard such terrible stories of them in the 

island, and having never been in those seas before, that he could 

not tell what to think of it, but said, two or three times, we 

should all be devoured.  I must confess, considering we were 

becalmed, and the current set strong towards the shore, I liked it 

the worse; however, I bade them not be afraid, but bring the ship 

to an anchor as soon as we came so near as to know that we must 

engage them.  The weather continued calm, and they came on apace 

towards us, so I gave orders to come to an anchor, and furl all our 

sails; as for the savages, I told them they had nothing to fear but 

fire, and therefore they should get their boats out, and fasten 

them, one close by the head and the other by the stern, and man 

them both well, and wait the issue in that posture:  this I did, 

that the men in the boats might he ready with sheets and buckets to 

put out any fire these savages might endeavour to fix to the 

outside of the ship.



In this posture we lay by for them, and in a little while they came 

up with us; but never was such a horrid sight seen by Christians; 

though my mate was much mistaken in his calculation of their 

number, yet when they came up we reckoned about a hundred and 

twenty-six canoes; some of them had sixteen or seventeen men in 

them, and some more, and the least six or seven.  When they came 

nearer to us, they seemed to be struck with wonder and 

astonishment, as at a sight which doubtless they had never seen 

before; nor could they at first, as we afterwards understood, know 

what to make of us; they came boldly up, however, very near to us, 

and seemed to go about to row round us; but we called to our men in 

the boats not to let them come too near them.  This very order 

brought us to an engagement with them, without our designing it; 

for five or six of the large canoes came so near our long-boat, 

that our men beckoned with their hands to keep them back, which 

they understood very well, and went back:  but at their retreat 

about fifty arrows came on board us from those boats, and one of 

our men in the long-boat was very much wounded.  However, I called 

to them not to fire by any means; but we handed down some deal 

boards into the boat, and the carpenter presently set up a kind of 

fence, like waste boards, to cover them from the arrows of the 

savages, if they should shoot again.



About half-an-hour afterwards they all came up in a body astern of 

us, and so near that we could easily discern what they were, though 

we could not tell their design; and I easily found they were some 

of my old friends, the same sort of savages that I had been used to 

engage with.  In a short time more they rowed a little farther out 

to sea, till they came directly broadside with us, and then rowed 

down straight upon us, till they came so near that they could hear 

us speak; upon this, I ordered all my men to keep close, lest they 

should shoot any more arrows, and made all our guns ready; but 

being so near as to be within hearing, I made Friday go out upon 

the deck, and call out aloud to them in his language, to know what 

they meant.  Whether they understood him or not, that I knew not; 

but as soon as he had called to them, six of them, who were in the 

foremost or nighest boat to us, turned their canoes from us, and 

stooping down, showed us their naked backs; whether this was a 

defiance or challenge we knew not, or whether it was done in mere 

contempt, or as a signal to the rest; but immediately Friday cried 

out they were going to shoot, and, unhappily for him, poor fellow, 

they let fly about three hundred of their arrows, and to my 

inexpressible grief, killed poor Friday, no other man being in 

their sight.  The poor fellow was shot with no less than three 

arrows, and about three more fell very near him; such unlucky 

marksmen they were!



I was so annoyed at the loss of my old trusty servant and 

companion, that I immediately ordered five guns to be loaded with 

small shot, and four with great, and gave them such a broadside as 

they had never heard in their lives before.  They were not above 

half a cable's length off when we fired; and our gunners took their 

aim so well, that three or four of their canoes were overset, as we 

had reason to believe, by one shot only.  The ill manners of 

turning up their bare backs to us gave us no great offence; neither 

did I know for certain whether that which would pass for the 

greatest contempt among us might be understood so by them or not; 

therefore, in return, I had only resolved to have fired four or 

five guns at them with powder only, which I knew would frighten 

them sufficiently:  but when they shot at us directly with all the 

fury they were capable of, and especially as they had killed my 

poor Friday, whom I so entirely loved and valued, and who, indeed, 

so well deserved it, I thought myself not only justifiable before 

God and man, but would have been very glad if I could have overset 

every canoe there, and drowned every one of them.



I can neither tell how many we killed nor how many we wounded at 

this broadside, but sure such a fright and hurry never were seen 

among such a multitude; there were thirteen or fourteen of their 

canoes split and overset in all, and the men all set a-swimming:  

the rest, frightened out of their wits, scoured away as fast as 

they could, taking but little care to save those whose boats were 

split or spoiled with our shot; so I suppose that many of them were 

lost; and our men took up one poor fellow swimming for his life, 

above an hour after they were all gone.  The small shot from our 

cannon must needs kill and wound a great many; but, in short, we 

never knew how it went with them, for they fled so fast, that in 

three hours or thereabouts we could not see above three or four 

straggling canoes, nor did we ever see the rest any more; for a 

breeze of wind springing up the same evening, we weighed and set 

sail for the Brazils.



We had a prisoner, indeed, but the creature was so sullen that he 

would neither cat nor speak, and we all fancied he would starve 

himself to death.  But I took a way to cure him:  for I had made 

them take him and turn him into the long-boat, and make him believe 

they would toss him into the sea again, and so leave him where they 

found him, if he would not speak; nor would that do, but they 

really did throw him into the sea, and came away from him.  Then he 

followed them, for he swam like a cork, and called to them in his 

tongue, though they knew not one word of what he said; however at 

last they took him in again., and then he began to he more 

tractable:  nor did I ever design they should drown him.



We were now under sail again, but I was the most disconsolate 

creature alive for want of my man Friday, and would have been very 

glad to have gone back to the island, to have taken one of the rest 

from thence for my occasion, but it could not be:  so we went on.  

We had one prisoner, as I have said, and it was a long time before 

we could make him understand anything; but in time our men taught 

him some English, and he began to be a little tractable.  

Afterwards, we inquired what country he came from; but could make 

nothing of what he said; for his speech was so odd, all gutturals, 

and he spoke in the throat in such a hollow, odd manner, that we 

could never form a word after him; and we were all of opinion that 

they might speak that language as well if they were gagged as 

otherwise; nor could we perceive that they had any occasion either 

for teeth, tongue, lips, or palate, but formed their words just as 

a hunting-horn forms a tune with an open throat.  He told us, 

however, some time after, when we had taught him to speak a little 

English, that they were going with their kings to fight a great 

battle.  When he said kings, we asked him how many kings?  He said 

they were five nation (we could not make him understand the plural 

's), and that they all joined to go against two nation.  We asked 

him what made them come up to us?  He said, "To makee te great 

wonder look."  Here it is to be observed that all those natives, as 

also those of Africa when they learn English, always add two e's at 

the end of the words where we use one; and they place the accent 

upon them, as makee, takee, and the like; nay, I could hardly make 

Friday leave it off, though at last he did.



And now I name the poor fellow once more, I must take my last leave 

of him.  Poor honest Friday!  We buried him with all the decency 

and solemnity possible, by putting him into a coffin, and throwing 

him into the sea; and I caused them to fire eleven guns for him.  

So ended the life of the most grateful, faithful, honest, and most 

affectionate servant that ever man had.



We went now away with a fair wind for Brazil; and in about twelve 

days' time we made land, in the latitude of five degrees south of 

the line, being the north-easternmost land of all that part of 

America.  We kept on S. by E., in sight of the shore four days, 

when we made Cape St. Augustine, and in three days came to an 

anchor off the bay of All Saints, the old place of my deliverance, 

from whence came both my good and evil fate.  Never ship came to 

this port that had less business than I had, and yet it was with 

great difficulty that we were admitted to hold the least 

correspondence on shore:  not my partner himself, who was alive, 

and made a great figure among them, not my two merchant-trustees, 

not the fame of my wonderful preservation in the island, could 

obtain me that favour.  My partner, however, remembering that I had 

given five hundred moidores to the prior of the monastery of the 

Augustines, and two hundred and seventy-two to the poor, went to 

the monastery, and obliged the prior that then was to go to the 

governor, and get leave for me personally, with the captain and one 

more, besides eight seamen, to come on shore, and no more; and this 

upon condition, absolutely capitulated for, that we should not 

offer to land any goods out of the ship, or to carry any person 

away without licence.  They were so strict with us as to landing 

any goods, that it was with extreme difficulty that I got on shore 

three bales of English goods, such as fine broadcloths, stuffs, and 

some linen, which I had brought for a present to my partner.



He was a very generous, open-hearted man, although he began, like 

me, with little at first.  Though he knew not that I had the least 

design of giving him anything, he sent me on board a present of 

fresh provisions, wine, and sweetmeats, worth about thirty 

moidores, including some tobacco, and three or four fine medals of 

gold:  but I was even with him in my present, which, as I have 

said, consisted of fine broadcloth, English stuffs, lace, and fine 

holland; also, I delivered him about the value of one hundred 

pounds sterling in the same goods, for other uses; and I obliged 

him to set up the sloop, which I had brought with me from England, 

as I have said, for the use of my colony, in order to send the 

refreshments I intended to my plantation.



Accordingly, he got hands, and finished the sloop in a very few 

days, for she was already framed; and I gave the master of her such 

instructions that he could not miss the place; nor did he, as I had 

an account from my partner afterwards.  I got him soon loaded with 

the small cargo I sent them; and one of our seamen, that had been 

on shore with me there, offered to go with the sloop and settle 

there, upon my letter to the governor Spaniard to allot him a 

sufficient quantity of land for a plantation, and on my giving him 

some clothes and tools for his planting work, which he said he 

understood, having been an old planter at Maryland, and a buccaneer 

into the bargain.  I encouraged the fellow by granting all he 

desired; and, as an addition, I gave him the savage whom we had 

taken prisoner of war to be his slave, and ordered the governor 

Spaniard to give him his share of everything he wanted with the 

rest.



When we came to fit this man out, my old partner told me there was 

a certain very honest fellow, a Brazil planter of his acquaintance, 

who had fallen into the displeasure of the Church.  "I know not 

what the matter is with him," says he, "but, on my conscience, I 

think he is a heretic in his heart, and he has been obliged to 

conceal himself for fear of the Inquisition." He then told me that 

he would be very glad of such an opportunity to make his escape, 

with his wife and two daughters; and if I would let them go to my 

island, and allot them a plantation, he would give them a small 

stock to begin with - for the officers of the Inquisition had 

seized all his effects and estate, and he had nothing left but a 

little household stuff and two slaves; "and," adds he, "though I 

hate his principles, yet I would not have him fall into their 

hands, for he will be assuredly burned alive if he does."  I 

granted this presently, and joined my Englishman with them:  and we 

concealed the man, and his wife and daughters, on board our ship, 

till the sloop put out to go to sea; and then having put all their 

goods on board some time before, we put them on board the sloop 

after she was got out of the bay.  Our seaman was mightily pleased 

with this new partner; and their stocks, indeed, were much alike, 

rich in tools, in preparations, and a farm - but nothing to begin 

with, except as above:  however, they carried over with them what 

was worth all the rest, some materials for planting sugar-canes, 

with some plants of canes, which he, I mean the Brazil planter, 

understood very well.



Among the rest of the supplies sent to my tenants in the island, I 

sent them by the sloop three milch cows and five calves; about 

twenty-two hogs, among them three sows; two mares, and a stone-

horse.  For my Spaniards, according to my promise, I engaged three 

Brazil women to go, and recommended it to them to marry them, and 

use them kindly.  I could have procured more women, but I 

remembered that the poor persecuted man had two daughters, and that 

there were but five of the Spaniards that wanted partners; the rest 

had wives of their own, though in another country.  All this cargo 

arrived safe, and, as you may easily suppose, was very welcome to 

my old inhabitants, who were now, with this addition, between sixty 

and seventy people, besides little children, of which there were a 

great many.  I found letters at London from them all, by way of 

Lisbon, when I came back to England.



I have now done with the island, and all manner of discourse about 

it:  and whoever reads the rest of my memorandums would do well to 

turn his thoughts entirely from it, and expect to read of the 

follies of an old man, not warned by his own harms, much less by 

those of other men, to beware; not cooled by almost forty years' 

miseries and disappointments - not satisfied with prosperity beyond 

expectation, nor made cautious by afflictions and distress beyond 

example.
