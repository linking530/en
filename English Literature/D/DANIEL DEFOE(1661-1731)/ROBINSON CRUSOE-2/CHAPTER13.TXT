THE greater weight the anxieties and perplexities of these things 

were to our thoughts while we were at sea, the greater was our 

satisfaction when we saw ourselves on shore; and my partner told me 

he dreamed that he had a very heavy load upon his back, which he 

was to carry up a hill, and found that he was not able to stand 

longer under it; but that the Portuguese pilot came and took it off 

his back, and the hill disappeared, the ground before him appearing 

all smooth and plain:  and truly it was so; they were all like men 

who had a load taken off their backs.  For my part I had a weight 

taken off from my heart that it was not able any longer to bear; 

and as I said above we resolved to go no more to sea in that ship.  

When we came on shore, the old pilot, who was now our friend, got 

us a lodging, together with a warehouse for our goods; it was a 

little hut, with a larger house adjoining to it, built and also 

palisadoed round with canes, to keep out pilferers, of which there 

were not a few in that country:  however, the magistrates allowed 

us a little guard, and we had a soldier with a kind of half-pike, 

who stood sentinel at our door, to whom we allowed a pint of rice 

and a piece of money about the value of three-pence per day, so 

that our goods were kept very safe.



The fair or mart usually kept at this place had been over some 

time; however, we found that there were three or four junks in the 

river, and two ships from Japan, with goods which they had bought 

in China, and were not gone away, having some Japanese merchants on 

shore.



The first thing our old Portuguese pilot did for us was to get us 

acquainted with three missionary Romish priests who were in the 

town, and who had been there some time converting the people to 

Christianity; but we thought they made but poor work of it, and 

made them but sorry Christians when they had done.  One of these 

was a Frenchman, whom they called Father Simon; another was a 

Portuguese; and a third a Genoese.  Father Simon was courteous, and 

very agreeable company; but the other two were more reserved, 

seemed rigid and austere, and applied seriously to the work they 

came about, viz. to talk with and insinuate themselves among the 

inhabitants wherever they had opportunity.  We often ate and drank 

with those men; and though I must confess the conversion, as they 

call it, of the Chinese to Christianity is so far from the true 

conversion required to bring heathen people to the faith of Christ, 

that it seems to amount to little more than letting them know the 

name of Christ, and say some prayers to the Virgin Mary and her 

Son, in a tongue which they understood not, and to cross 

themselves, and the like; yet it must be confessed that the 

religionists, whom we call missionaries, have a firm belief that 

these people will be saved, and that they are the instruments of 

it; and on this account they undergo not only the fatigue of the 

voyage, and the hazards of living in such places, but oftentimes 

death itself, and the most violent tortures, for the sake of this 

work.



Father Simon was appointed, it seems, by order of the chief of the 

mission, to go up to Pekin, and waited only for another priest, who 

was ordered to come to him from Macao, to go along with him.  We 

scarce ever met together but he was inviting me to go that journey; 

telling me how he would show me all the glorious things of that 

mighty empire, and, among the rest, Pekin, the greatest city in the 

world:  "A city," said he, "that your London and our Paris put 

together cannot be equal to."  But as I looked on those things with 

different eyes from other men, so I shall give my opinion of them 

in a few words, when I come in the course of my travels to speak 

more particularly of them.



Dining with Father Simon one day, and being very merry together, I 

showed some little inclination to go with him; and he pressed me 

and my partner very hard to consent.  "Why, father," says my 

partner, "should you desire our company so much? you know we are 

heretics, and you do not love us, nor cannot keep us company with 

any pleasure." - "Oh," says he, "you may perhaps be good Catholics 

in time; my business here is to convert heathens, and who knows but 

I may convert you too?" - "Very well, father," said I, "so you will 

preach to us all the way?" - "I will not be troublesome to you," 

says he; "our religion does not divest us of good manners; besides, 

we are here like countrymen; and so we are, compared to the place 

we are in; and if you are Huguenots, and I a Catholic, we may all 

be Christians at last; at least, we are all gentlemen, and we may 

converse so, without being uneasy to one another."  I liked this 

part of his discourse very well, and it began to put me in mind of 

my priest that I had left in the Brazils; but Father Simon did not 

come up to his character by a great deal; for though this friar had 

no appearance of a criminal levity in him, yet he had not that fund 

of Christian zeal, strict piety, and sincere affection to religion 

that my other good ecclesiastic had.



But to leave him a little, though he never left us, nor solicited 

us to go with him; we had something else before us at first, for we 

had all this while our ship and our merchandise to dispose of, and 

we began to be very doubtful what we should do, for we were now in 

a place of very little business.  Once I was about to venture to 

sail for the river of Kilam, and the city of Nankin; but Providence 

seemed now more visibly, as I thought, than ever to concern itself 

in our affairs; and I was encouraged, from this very time, to think 

I should, one way or other, get out of this entangled circumstance, 

and be brought home to my own country again, though I had not the 

least view of the manner.  Providence, I say, began here to clear 

up our way a little; and the first thing that offered was, that our 

old Portuguese pilot brought a Japan merchant to us, who inquired 

what goods we had:  and, in the first place, he bought all our 

opium, and gave us a very good price for it, paying us in gold by 

weight, some in small pieces of their own coin, and some in small 

wedges, of about ten or twelves ounces each.  While we were dealing 

with him for our opium, it came into my head that he might perhaps 

deal for the ship too, and I ordered the interpreter to propose it 

to him.  He shrunk up his shoulders at it when it was first 

proposed to him; but in a few days after he came to me, with one of 

the missionary priests for his interpreter, and told me he had a 

proposal to make to me, which was this:  he had bought a great 

quantity of our goods, when he had no thoughts of proposals made to 

him of buying the ship; and that, therefore, he had not money to 

pay for the ship:  but if I would let the same men who were in the 

ship navigate her, he would hire the ship to go to Japan; and would 

send them from thence to the Philippine Islands with another 

loading, which he would pay the freight of before they went from 

Japan:  and that at their return he would buy the ship.  I began to 

listen to his proposal, and so eager did my head still run upon 

rambling, that I could not but begin to entertain a notion of going 

myself with him, and so to set sail from the Philippine Islands 

away to the South Seas; accordingly, I asked the Japanese merchant 

if he would not hire us to the Philippine Islands and discharge us 

there.  He said No, he could not do that, for then he could not 

have the return of his cargo; but he would discharge us in Japan, 

at the ship's return.  Well, still I was for taking him at that 

proposal, and going myself; but my partner, wiser than myself, 

persuaded me from it, representing the dangers, as well of the seas 

as of the Japanese, who are a false, cruel, and treacherous people; 

likewise those of the Spaniards at the Philippines, more false, 

cruel, and treacherous than they.



But to bring this long turn of our affairs to a conclusion; the 

first thing we had to do was to consult with the captain of the 

ship, and with his men, and know if they were willing to go to 

Japan.  While I was doing this, the young man whom my nephew had 

left with me as my companion came up, and told me that he thought 

that voyage promised very fair, and that there was a great prospect 

of advantage, and he would be very glad if I undertook it; but that 

if I would not, and would give him leave, he would go as a 

merchant, or as I pleased to order him; that if ever he came to 

England, and I was there and alive, he would render me a faithful 

account of his success, which should be as much mine as I pleased.  

I was loath to part with him; but considering the prospect of 

advantage, which really was considerable, and that he was a young 

fellow likely to do well in it, I inclined to let him go; but I 

told him I would consult my partner, and give him an answer the 

next day.  I discoursed about it with my partner, who thereupon 

made a most generous offer:  "You know it has been an unlucky 

ship," said he, "and we both resolve not to go to sea in it again; 

if your steward" (so he called my man) "will venture the voyage, I 

will leave my share of the vessel to him, and let him make the best 

of it; and if we live to meet in England, and he meets with success 

abroad, he shall account for one half of the profits of the ship's 

freight to us; the other shall be his own."



If my partner, who was no way concerned with my young man, made him 

such an offer, I could not do less than offer him the same; and all 

the ship's company being willing to go with him, we made over half 

the ship to him in property, and took a writing from him, obliging 

him to account for the other, and away he went to Japan.  The Japan 

merchant proved a very punctual, honest man to him:  protected him 

at Japan, and got him a licence to come on shore, which the 

Europeans in general have not lately obtained.  He paid him his 

freight very punctually; sent him to the Philippines loaded with 

Japan and China wares, and a supercargo of their own, who, 

trafficking with the Spaniards, brought back European goods again, 

and a great quantity of spices; and there he was not only paid his 

freight very well, and at a very good price, but not being willing 

to sell the ship, then the merchant furnished him goods on his own 

account; and with some money, and some spices of his own which he 

brought with him, he went back to the Manillas, where he sold his 

cargo very well.  Here, having made a good acquaintance at Manilla, 

he got his ship made a free ship, and the governor of Manilla hired 

him to go to Acapulco, on the coast of America, and gave him a 

licence to land there, and to travel to Mexico, and to pass in any 

Spanish ship to Europe with all his men.  He made the voyage to 

Acapulco very happily, and there he sold his ship:  and having 

there also obtained allowance to travel by land to Porto Bello, he 

found means to get to Jamaica, with all his treasure, and about 

eight years after came to England exceeding rich.



But to return to our particular affairs, being now to part with the 

ship and ship's company, it came before us, of course, to consider 

what recompense we should give to the two men that gave us such 

timely notice of the design against us in the river Cambodia.  The 

truth was, they had done us a very considerable service, and 

deserved well at our hands; though, by the way, they were a couple 

of rogues, too; for, as they believed the story of our being 

pirates, and that we had really run away with the ship, they came 

down to us, not only to betray the design that was formed against 

us, but to go to sea with us as pirates.  One of them confessed 

afterwards that nothing else but the hopes of going a-roguing 

brought him to do it:  however, the service they did us was not the 

less, and therefore, as I had promised to be grateful to them, I 

first ordered the money to be paid them which they said was due to 

them on board their respective ships:  over and above that, I gave 

each of them a small sum of money in gold, which contented them 

very well.  I then made the Englishman gunner in the ship, the 

gunner being now made second mate and purser; the Dutchman I made 

boatswain; so they were both very well pleased, and proved very 

serviceable, being both able seamen, and very stout fellows.



We were now on shore in China; if I thought myself banished, and 

remote from my own country at Bengal, where I had many ways to get 

home for my money, what could I think of myself now, when I was 

about a thousand leagues farther off from home, and destitute of 

all manner of prospect of return?  All we had for it was this:  

that in about four months' time there was to be another fair at the 

place where we were, and then we might be able to purchase various 

manufactures of the country, and withal might possibly find some 

Chinese junks from Tonquin for sail, that would carry us and our 

goods whither we pleased.  This I liked very well, and resolved to 

wait; besides, as our particular persons were not obnoxious, so if 

any English or Dutch ships came thither, perhaps we might have an 

opportunity to load our goods, and get passage to some other place 

in India nearer home.  Upon these hopes we resolved to continue 

here; but, to divert ourselves, we took two or three journeys into 

the country.



First, we went ten days' journey to Nankin, a city well worth 

seeing; they say it has a million of people in it:  it is regularly 

built, and the streets are all straight, and cross one another in 

direct lines.  But when I come to compare the miserable people of 

these countries with ours, their fabrics, their manner of living, 

their government, their religion, their wealth, and their glory, as 

some call it, I must confess that I scarcely think it worth my 

while to mention them here.  We wonder at the grandeur, the riches, 

the pomp, the ceremonies, the government, the manufactures, the 

commerce, and conduct of these people; not that there is really any 

matter for wonder, but because, having a true notion of the 

barbarity of those countries, the rudeness and the ignorance that 

prevail there, we do not expect to find any such thing so far off.  

Otherwise, what are their buildings to the palaces and royal 

buildings of Europe?  What their trade to the universal commerce of 

England, Holland, France, and Spain?  What are their cities to 

ours, for wealth, strength, gaiety of apparel, rich furniture, and 

infinite variety?  What are their ports, supplied with a few junks 

and barks, to our navigation, our merchant fleets, our large and 

powerful navies?  Our city of London has more trade than half their 

mighty empire:  one English, Dutch, or French man-of-war of eighty 

guns would be able to fight almost all the shipping belonging to 

China:  but the greatness of their wealth, their trade, the power 

of their government, and the strength of their armies, may be a 

little surprising to us, because, as I have said, considering them 

as a barbarous nation of pagans, little better than savages, we did 

not expect such things among them.  But all the forces of their 

empire, though they were to bring two millions of men into the 

field together, would be able to do nothing but ruin the country 

and starve themselves; a million of their foot could not stand 

before one embattled body of our infantry, posted so as not to be 

surrounded, though they were not to be one to twenty in number; 

nay, I do not boast if I say that thirty thousand German or English 

foot, and ten thousand horse, well managed, could defeat all the 

forces of China.  Nor is there a fortified town in China that could 

hold out one month against the batteries and attacks of an European 

army.  They have firearms, it is true, but they are awkward and 

uncertain in their going off; and their powder has but little 

strength.  Their armies are badly disciplined, and want skill to 

attack, or temper to retreat; and therefore, I must confess, it 

seemed strange to me, when I came home, and heard our people say 

such fine things of the power, glory, magnificence, and trade of 

the Chinese; because, as far as I saw, they appeared to be a 

contemptible herd or crowd of ignorant, sordid slaves, subjected to 

a government qualified only to rule such a people; and were not its 

distance inconceivably, great from Muscovy, and that empire in a 

manner as rude, impotent, and ill governed as they, the Czar of 

Muscovy might with ease drive them all out of their country, and 

conquer them in one campaign; and had the Czar (who is now a 

growing prince) fallen this way, instead of attacking the warlike 

Swedes, and equally improved himself in the art of war, as they say 

he has done; and if none of the powers of Europe had envied or 

interrupted him, he might by this time have been Emperor of China, 

instead of being beaten by the King of Sweden at Narva, when the 

latter was not one to six in number.



As their strength and their grandeur, so their navigation, 

commerce, and husbandry are very imperfect, compared to the same 

things in Europe; also, in their knowledge, their learning, and in 

their skill in the sciences, they are either very awkward or 

defective, though they have globes or spheres, and a smattering of 

the mathematics, and think they know more than all the world 

besides.  But they know little of the motions of the heavenly 

bodies; and so grossly and absurdly ignorant are their common 

people, that when the sun is eclipsed, they think a great dragon 

has assaulted it, and is going to run away with it; and they fall a 

clattering with all the drums and kettles in the country, to fright 

the monster away, just as we do to hive a swarm of bees!



As this is the only excursion of the kind which I have made in all 

the accounts I have given of my travels, so I shall make no more 

such.  It is none of my business, nor any part of my design; but to 

give an account of my own adventures through a life of inimitable 

wanderings, and a long variety of changes, which, perhaps, few that 

come after me will have heard the like of:  I shall, therefore, say 

very little of all the mighty places, desert countries, and 

numerous people I have yet to pass through, more than relates to my 

own story, and which my concern among them will make necessary.



I was now, as near as I can compute, in the heart of China, about 

thirty degrees north of the line, for we were returned from Nankin.  

I had indeed a mind to see the city of Pekin, which I had heard so 

much of, and Father Simon importuned me daily to do it.  At length 

his time of going away being set, and the other missionary who was 

to go with him being arrived from Macao, it was necessary that we 

should resolve either to go or not; so I referred it to my partner, 

and left it wholly to his choice, who at length resolved it in the 

affirmative, and we prepared for our journey.  We set out with very 

good advantage as to finding the way; for we got leave to travel in 

the retinue of one of their mandarins, a kind of viceroy or 

principal magistrate in the province where they reside, and who 

take great state upon them, travelling with great attendance, and 

great homage from the people, who are sometimes greatly 

impoverished by them, being obliged to furnish provisions for them 

and all their attendants in their journeys.  I particularly 

observed in our travelling with his baggage, that though we 

received sufficient provisions both for ourselves and our horses 

from the country, as belonging to the mandarin, yet we were obliged 

to pay for everything we had, after the market price of the 

country, and the mandarin's steward collected it duly from us.  

Thus our travelling in the retinue of the mandarin, though it was a 

great act of kindness, was not such a mighty favour to us, but was 

a great advantage to him, considering there were above thirty other 

people travelled in the same manner besides us, under the 

protection of his retinue; for the country furnished all the 

provisions for nothing to him, and yet he took our money for them.



We were twenty-five days travelling to Pekin, through a country 

exceeding populous, but I think badly cultivated; the husbandry, 

the economy, and the way of living miserable, though they boast so 

much of the industry of the people:  I say miserable, if compared 

with our own, but not so to these poor wretches, who know no other.  

The pride of the poor people is infinitely great, and exceeded by 

nothing but their poverty, in some parts, which adds to that which 

I call their misery; and I must needs think the savages of America 

live much more happy than the poorer sort of these, because as they 

have nothing, so they desire nothing; whereas these are proud and 

insolent and in the main are in many parts mere beggars and 

drudges.  Their ostentation is inexpressible; and, if they can, 

they love to keep multitudes of servants or slaves, which is to the 

last degree ridiculous, as well as their contempt of all the world 

but themselves.



I must confess I travelled more pleasantly afterwards in the 

deserts and vast wildernesses of Grand Tartary than here, and yet 

the roads here are well paved and well kept, and very convenient 

for travellers; but nothing was more awkward to me than to see such 

a haughty, imperious, insolent people, in the midst of the grossest 

simplicity and ignorance; and my friend Father Simon and I used to 

be very merry upon these occasions, to see their beggarly pride.  

For example, coming by the house of a country gentleman, as Father 

Simon called him, about ten leagues off the city of Nankin, we had 

first of all the honour to ride with the master of the house about 

two miles; the state he rode in was a perfect Don Quixotism, being 

a mixture of pomp and poverty.  His habit was very proper for a 

merry-andrew, being a dirty calico, with hanging sleeves, tassels, 

and cuts and slashes almost on every side:  it covered a taffety 

vest, so greasy as to testify that his honour must be a most 

exquisite sloven.  His horse was a poor, starved, hobbling 

creature, and two slaves followed him on foot to drive the poor 

creature along; he had a whip in his hand, and he belaboured the 

beast as fast about the head as his slaves did about the tail; and 

thus he rode by us, with about ten or twelve servants, going from 

the city to his country seat, about half a league before us.  We 

travelled on gently, but this figure of a gentleman rode away 

before us; and as we stopped at a village about an hour to refresh 

us, when we came by the country seat of this great man, we saw him 

in a little place before his door, eating a repast.  It was a kind 

of garden, but he was easy to be seen; and we were given to 

understand that the more we looked at him the better he would be 

pleased.  He sat under a tree, something like the palmetto, which 

effectually shaded him over the head, and on the south side; but 

under the tree was placed a large umbrella, which made that part 

look well enough.  He sat lolling back in a great elbow-chair, 

being a heavy corpulent man, and had his meat brought him by two 

women slaves.  He had two more, one of whom fed the squire with a 

spoon, and the other held the dish with one hand, and scraped off 

what he let fall upon his worship's beard and taffety vest.



Leaving the poor wretch to please himself with our looking at him, 

as if we admired his idle pomp, we pursued our journey.  Father 

Simon had the curiosity to stay to inform himself what dainties the 

country justice had to feed on in all his state, which he had the 

honour to taste of, and which was, I think, a mess of boiled rice, 

with a great piece of garlic in it, and a little bag filled with 

green pepper, and another plant which they have there, something 

like our ginger, but smelling like musk, and tasting like mustard; 

all this was put together, and a small piece of lean mutton boiled 

in it, and this was his worship's repast.  Four or five servants 

more attended at a distance, who we supposed were to eat of the 

same after their master.  As for our mandarin with whom we 

travelled, he was respected as a king, surrounded always with his 

gentlemen, and attended in all his appearances with such pomp, that 

I saw little of him but at a distance.  I observed that there was 

not a horse in his retinue but that our carrier's packhorses in 

England seemed to me to look much better; though it was hard to 

judge rightly, for they were so covered with equipage, mantles, 

trappings, &c., that we could scarce see anything but their feet 

and their heads as they went along.



I was now light-hearted, and all my late trouble and perplexity 

being over, I had no anxious thoughts about me, which made this 

journey the pleasanter to me; in which no ill accident attended me, 

only in passing or fording a small river, my horse fell and made me 

free of the country, as they call it - that is to say, threw me in.  

The place was not deep, but it wetted me all over.  I mention it 

because it spoiled my pocket-book, wherein I had set down the names 

of several people and places which I had occasion to remember, and 

which not taking due care of, the leaves rotted, and the words were 

never after to be read.



At length we arrived at Pekin.  I had nobody with me but the youth 

whom my nephew had given me to attend me as a servant and who 

proved very trusty and diligent; and my partner had nobody with him 

but one servant, who was a kinsman.  As for the Portuguese pilot, 

he being desirous to see the court, we bore his charges for his 

company, and for our use of him as an interpreter, for he 

understood the language of the country, and spoke good French and a 

little English.  Indeed, this old man was most useful to us 

everywhere; for we had not been above a week at Pekin, when he came 

laughing.  "Ah, Seignior Inglese," says he, "I have something to 

tell will make your heart glad." - "My heart glad," says I; "what 

can that be?  I don't know anything in this country can either give 

me joy or grief to any great degree." - "Yes, yes," said the old 

man, in broken English, "make you glad, me sorry." - "Why," said I, 

"will it make you sorry?" - "Because," said he, "you have brought 

me here twenty-five days' journey, and will leave me to go back 

alone; and which way shall I get to my port afterwards, without a 

ship, without a horse, without PECUNE?" so he called money, being 

his broken Latin, of which he had abundance to make us merry with.  

In short, he told us there was a great caravan of Muscovite and 

Polish merchants in the city, preparing to set out on their journey 

by land to Muscovy, within four or five weeks; and he was sure we 

would take the opportunity to go with them, and leave him behind, 

to go back alone.



I confess I was greatly surprised with this good news, and had 

scarce power to speak to him for some time; but at last I said to 

him, "How do you know this? are you sure it is true?" - "Yes," says 

he; "I met this morning in the street an old acquaintance of mine, 

an Armenian, who is among them.  He came last from Astrakhan, and 

was designed to go to Tonquin, where I formerly knew him, but has 

altered his mind, and is now resolved to go with the caravan to 

Moscow, and so down the river Volga to Astrakhan." - "Well, 

Seignior," says I, "do not be uneasy about being left to go back 

alone; if this be a method for my return to England, it shall be 

your fault if you go back to Macao at all."  We then went to 

consult together what was to be done; and I asked my partner what 

he thought of the pilot's news, and whether it would suit with his 

affairs?  He told me he would do just as I would; for he had 

settled all his affairs so well at Bengal, and left his effects in 

such good hands, that as we had made a good voyage, if he could 

invest it in China silks, wrought and raw, he would be content to 

go to England, and then make a voyage back to Bengal by the 

Company's ships.



Having resolved upon this, we agreed that if our Portuguese pilot 

would go with us, we would bear his charges to Moscow, or to 

England, if he pleased; nor, indeed, were we to be esteemed over-

generous in that either, if we had not rewarded him further, the 

service he had done us being really worth more than that; for he 

had not only been a pilot to us at sea, but he had been like a 

broker for us on shore; and his procuring for us a Japan merchant 

was some hundreds of pounds in our pockets.  So, being willing to 

gratify him, which was but doing him justice, and very willing also 

to have him with us besides, for he was a most necessary man on all 

occasions, we agreed to give him a quantity of coined gold, which, 

as I computed it, was worth one hundred and seventy-five pounds 

sterling, between us, and to bear all his charges, both for himself 

and horse, except only a horse to carry his goods.  Having settled 

this between ourselves, we called him to let him know what we had 

resolved.  I told him he had complained of our being willing to let 

him go back alone, and I was now about to tell him we designed he 

should not go back at all.  That as we had resolved to go to Europe 

with the caravan, we were very willing he should go with us; and 

that we called him to know his mind.  He shook his head and said it 

was a long journey, and that he had no PECUNE to carry him thither, 

or to subsist himself when he came there.  We told him we believed 

it was so, and therefore we had resolved to do something for him 

that should let him see how sensible we were of the service he had 

done us, and also how agreeable he was to us:  and then I told him 

what we had resolved to give him here, which he might lay out as we 

would do our own; and that as for his charges, if he would go with 

us we would set him safe on shore (life and casualties excepted), 

either in Muscovy or England, as he would choose, at our own 

charge, except only the carriage of his goods.  He received the 

proposal like a man transported, and told us he would go with us 

over all the whole world; and so we all prepared for our journey.  

However, as it was with us, so it was with the other merchants:  

they had many things to do, and instead of being ready in five 

weeks, it was four months and some days before all things were got 

together.
