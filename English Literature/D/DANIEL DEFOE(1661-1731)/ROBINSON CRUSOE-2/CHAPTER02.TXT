IT was in the latitude of 27 degrees 5 minutes N., on the 19th day 

of March 1694-95, when we spied a sail, our course SE. and by S.  

We soon perceived it was a large vessel, and that she bore up to 

us, but could not at first know what to make of her, till, after 

coming a little nearer, we found she had lost her main-topmast, 

fore-mast, and bowsprit; and presently she fired a gun as a signal 

of distress.  The weather was pretty good, wind at NNW. a fresh 

gale, and we soon came to speak with her.  We found her a ship of 

Bristol, bound home from Barbadoes, but had been blown out of the 

road at Barbadoes a few days before she was ready to sail, by a 

terrible hurricane, while the captain and chief mate were both gone 

on shore; so that, besides the terror of the storm, they were in an 

indifferent case for good mariners to bring the ship home.  They 

had been already nine weeks at sea, and had met with another 

terrible storm, after the hurricane was over, which had blown them 

quite out of their knowledge to the westward, and in which they 

lost their masts.  They told us they expected to have seen the 

Bahama Islands, but were then driven away again to the south-east, 

by a strong gale of wind at NNW., the same that blew now:  and 

having no sails to work the ship with but a main course, and a kind 

of square sail upon a jury fore-mast, which they had set up, they 

could not lie near the wind, but were endeavouring to stand away 

for the Canaries.



But that which was worst of all was, that they were almost starved 

for want of provisions, besides the fatigues they had undergone; 

their bread and flesh were quite gone - they had not one ounce left 

in the ship, and had had none for eleven days.  The only relief 

they had was, their water was not all spent, and they had about 

half a barrel of flour left; they had sugar enough; some succades, 

or sweetmeats, they had at first, but these were all devoured; and 

they had seven casks of rum.  There was a youth and his mother and 

a maid-servant on board, who were passengers, and thinking the ship 

was ready to sail, unhappily came on board the evening before the 

hurricane began; and having no provisions of their own left, they 

were in a more deplorable condition than the rest:  for the seamen 

being reduced to such an extreme necessity themselves, had no 

compassion, we may be sure, for the poor passengers; and they were, 

indeed, in such a condition that their misery is very hard to 

describe.



I had perhaps not known this part, if my curiosity had not led me, 

the weather being fair and the wind abated, to go on board the 

ship.  The second mate, who upon this occasion commanded the ship, 

had been on board our ship, and he told me they had three 

passengers in the great cabin that were in a deplorable condition.  

"Nay," says he, "I believe they are dead, for I have heard nothing 

of them for above two days; and I was afraid to inquire after 

them," said he, "for I had nothing to relieve them with."  We 

immediately applied ourselves to give them what relief we could 

spare; and indeed I had so far overruled things with my nephew, 

that I would have victualled them though we had gone away to 

Virginia, or any other part of the coast of America, to have 

supplied ourselves; but there was no necessity for that.



But now they were in a new danger; for they were afraid of eating 

too much, even of that little we gave them.  The mate, or 

commander, brought six men with him in his boat; but these poor 

wretches looked like skeletons, and were so weak that they could 

hardly sit to their oars.  The mate himself was very ill, and half 

starved; for he declared he had reserved nothing from the men, and 

went share and share alike with them in every bit they ate.  I 

cautioned him to eat sparingly, and set meat before him 

immediately, but he had not eaten three mouthfuls before he began 

to be sick and out of order; so he stopped a while, and our surgeon 

mixed him up something with some broth, which he said would be to 

him both food and physic; and after he had taken it he grew better.  

In the meantime I forgot not the men.  I ordered victuals to be 

given them, and the poor creatures rather devoured than ate it:  

they were so exceedingly hungry that they were in a manner 

ravenous, and had no command of themselves; and two of them ate 

with so much greediness that they were in danger of their lives the 

next morning.  The sight of these people's distress was very moving 

to me, and brought to mind what I had a terrible prospect of at my 

first coming on shore in my island, where I had not the least 

mouthful of food, or any prospect of procuring any; besides the 

hourly apprehensions I had of being made the food of other 

creatures.  But all the while the mate was thus relating to me the 

miserable condition of the ship's company, I could not put out of 

my thought the story he had told me of the three poor creatures in 

the great cabin, viz. the mother, her son, and the maid-servant, 

whom he had heard nothing of for two or three days, and whom, he 

seemed to confess, they had wholly neglected, their own extremities 

being so great; by which I understood that they had really given 

them no food at all, and that therefore they must be perished, and 

be all lying dead, perhaps, on the floor or deck of the cabin.



As I therefore kept the mate, whom we then called captain, on board 

with his men, to refresh them, so I also forgot not the starving 

crew that were left on board, but ordered my own boat to go on 

board the ship, and, with my mate and twelve men, to carry them a 

sack of bread, and four or five pieces of beef to boil.  Our 

surgeon charged the men to cause the meat to be boiled while they 

stayed, and to keep guard in the cook-room, to prevent the men 

taking it to eat raw, or taking it out of the pot before it was 

well boiled, and then to give every man but a very little at a 

time:  and by this caution he preserved the men, who would 

otherwise have killed themselves with that very food that was given 

them on purpose to save their lives.



At the same time I ordered the mate to go into the great cabin, and 

see what condition the poor passengers were in; and if they were 

alive, to comfort them, and give them what refreshment was proper:  

and the surgeon gave him a large pitcher, with some of the prepared 

broth which he had given the mate that was on board, and which he 

did not question would restore them gradually.  I was not satisfied 

with this; but, as I said above, having a great mind to see the 

scene of misery which I knew the ship itself would present me with, 

in a more lively manner than I could have it by report, I took the 

captain of the ship, as we now called him, with me, and went 

myself, a little after, in their boat.



I found the poor men on board almost in a tumult to get the 

victuals out of the boiler before it was ready; but my mate 

observed his orders, and kept a good guard at the cook-room door, 

and the man he placed there, after using all possible persuasion to 

have patience, kept them off by force; however, he caused some 

biscuit-cakes to be dipped in the pot, and softened with the liquor 

of the meat, which they called brewis, and gave them every one some 

to stay their stomachs, and told them it was for their own safety 

that he was obliged to give them but little at a time.  But it was 

all in vain; and had I not come on board, and their own commander 

and officers with me, and with good words, and some threats also of 

giving them no more, I believe they would have broken into the 

cook-room by force, and torn the meat out of the furnace - for 

words are indeed of very small force to a hungry belly; however, we 

pacified them, and fed them gradually and cautiously at first, and 

the next time gave them more, and at last filled their bellies, and 

the men did well enough.



But the misery of the poor passengers in the cabin was of another 

nature, and far beyond the rest; for as, first, the ship's company 

had so little for themselves, it was but too true that they had at 

first kept them very low, and at last totally neglected them:  so 

that for six or seven days it might be said they had really no food 

at all, and for several days before very little.  The poor mother, 

who, as the men reported, was a woman of sense and good breeding, 

had spared all she could so affectionately for her son, that at 

last she entirely sank under it; and when the mate of our ship went 

in, she sat upon the floor on deck, with her back up against the 

sides, between two chairs, which were lashed fast, and her head 

sunk between her shoulders like a corpse, though not quite dead.  

My mate said all he could to revive and encourage her, and with a 

spoon put some broth into her mouth.  She opened her lips, and 

lifted up one hand, but could not speak:  yet she understood what 

he said, and made signs to him, intimating, that it was too late 

for her, but pointed to her child, as if she would have said they 

should take care of him.  However, the mate, who was exceedingly 

moved at the sight, endeavoured to get some of the broth into her 

mouth, and, as he said, got two or three spoonfuls down - though I 

question whether he could be sure of it or not; but it was too 

late, and she died the same night.



The youth, who was preserved at the price of his most affectionate 

mother's life, was not so far gone; yet he lay in a cabin bed, as 

one stretched out, with hardly any life left in him.  He had a 

piece of an old glove in his mouth, having eaten up the rest of it; 

however, being young, and having more strength than his mother, the 

mate got something down his throat, and he began sensibly to 

revive; though by giving him, some time after, but two or three 

spoonfuls extraordinary, he was very sick, and brought it up again.



But the next care was the poor maid:  she lay all along upon the 

deck, hard by her mistress, and just like one that had fallen down 

in a fit of apoplexy, and struggled for life.  Her limbs were 

distorted; one of her hands was clasped round the frame of the 

chair, and she gripped it so hard that we could not easily make her 

let it go; her other arm lay over her head, and her feet lay both 

together, set fast against the frame of the cabin table:  in short, 

she lay just like one in the agonies of death, and yet she was 

alive too.  The poor creature was not only starved with hunger, and 

terrified with the thoughts of death, but, as the men told us 

afterwards, was broken-hearted for her mistress, whom she saw dying 

for two or three days before, and whom she loved most tenderly.  We 

knew not what to do with this poor girl; for when our surgeon, who 

was a man of very great knowledge and experience, had, with great 

application, recovered her as to life, he had her upon his hands 

still; for she was little less than distracted for a considerable 

time after.



Whoever shall read these memorandums must be desired to consider 

that visits at sea are not like a journey into the country, where 

sometimes people stay a week or a fortnight at a place.  Our 

business was to relieve this distressed ship's crew, but not lie by 

for them; and though they were willing to steer the same course 

with us for some days, yet we could carry no sail to keep pace with 

a ship that had no masts.  However, as their captain begged of us 

to help him to set up a main-topmast, and a kind of a topmast to 

his jury fore-mast, we did, as it were, lie by him for three or 

four days; and then, having given him five barrels of beef, a 

barrel of pork, two hogsheads of biscuit, and a proportion of peas, 

flour, and what other things we could spare; and taking three casks 

of sugar, some rum, and some pieces of eight from them for 

satisfaction, we left them, taking on board with us, at their own 

earnest request, the youth and the maid, and all their goods.



The young lad was about seventeen years of age, a pretty, well-

bred, modest, and sensible youth, greatly dejected with the loss of 

his mother, and also at having lost his father but a few months 

before, at Barbadoes.  He begged of the surgeon to speak to me to 

take him out of the ship; for he said the cruel fellows had 

murdered his mother:  and indeed so they had, that is to say, 

passively; for they might have spared a small sustenance to the 

poor helpless widow, though it had been but just enough to keep her 

alive; but hunger knows no friend, no relation, no justice, no 

right, and therefore is remorseless, and capable of no compassion.



The surgeon told him how far we were going, and that it would carry 

him away from all his friends, and put him, perhaps, in as bad 

circumstances almost as those we found him in, that is to say, 

starving in the world.  He said it mattered not whither he went, if 

he was but delivered from the terrible crew that he was among; that 

the captain (by which he meant me, for he could know nothing of my 

nephew) had saved his life, and he was sure would not hurt him; and 

as for the maid, he was sure, if she came to herself, she would be 

very thankful for it, let us carry them where we would.  The 

surgeon represented the case so affectionately to me that I 

yielded, and we took them both on board, with all their goods, 

except eleven hogsheads of sugar, which could not be removed or 

come at; and as the youth had a bill of lading for them, I made his 

commander sign a writing, obliging himself to go, as soon as he 

came to Bristol, to one Mr. Rogers, a merchant there, to whom the 

youth said he was related, and to deliver a letter which I wrote to 

him, and all the goods he had belonging to the deceased widow; 

which, I suppose, was not done, for I could never learn that the 

ship came to Bristol, but was, as is most probable, lost at sea, 

being in so disabled a condition, and so far from any land, that I 

am of opinion the first storm she met with afterwards she might 

founder, for she was leaky, and had damage in her hold when we met 

with her.



I was now in the latitude of 19 degrees 32 minutes, and had 

hitherto a tolerable voyage as to weather, though at first the 

winds had been contrary.  I shall trouble nobody with the little 

incidents of wind, weather, currents, &c., on the rest of our 

voyage; but to shorten my story, shall observe that I came to my 

old habitation, the island, on the 10th of April 1695.  It was with 

no small difficulty that I found the place; for as I came to it and 

went to it before on the south and east side of the island, coming 

from the Brazils, so now, coming in between the main and the 

island, and having no chart for the coast, nor any landmark, I did 

not know it when I saw it, or, know whether I saw it or not.  We 

beat about a great while, and went on shore on several islands in 

the mouth of the great river Orinoco, but none for my purpose; only 

this I learned by my coasting the shore, that I was under one great 

mistake before, viz. that the continent which I thought I saw from 

the island I lived in was really no continent, but a long island, 

or rather a ridge of islands, reaching from one to the other side 

of the extended mouth of that great river; and that the savages who 

came to my island were not properly those which we call Caribbees, 

but islanders, and other barbarians of the same kind, who inhabited 

nearer to our side than the rest.



In short, I visited several of these islands to no purpose; some I 

found were inhabited, and some were not; on one of them I found 

some Spaniards, and thought they had lived there; but speaking with 

them, found they had a sloop lying in a small creek hard by, and 

came thither to make salt, and to catch some pearl-mussels if they 

could; but that they belonged to the Isle de Trinidad, which lay 

farther north, in the latitude of 10 and 11 degrees.



Thus coasting from one island to another, sometimes with the ship, 

sometimes with the Frenchman's shallop, which we had found a 

convenient boat, and therefore kept her with their very good will, 

at length I came fair on the south side of my island, and presently 

knew the very countenance of the place:  so I brought the ship safe 

to an anchor, broadside with the little creek where my old 

habitation was.  As soon as I saw the place I called for Friday, 

and asked him if he knew where he was?  He looked about a little, 

and presently clapping his hands, cried, "Oh yes, Oh there, Oh yes, 

Oh there!" pointing to our old habitation, and fell dancing and 

capering like a mad fellow; and I had much ado to keep him from 

jumping into the sea to swim ashore to the place.



"Well, Friday," says I, "do you think we shall find anybody here or 

no? and do you think we shall see your father?"  The fellow stood 

mute as a stock a good while; but when I named his father, the poor 

affectionate creature looked dejected, and I could see the tears 

run down his face very plentifully.  "What is the matter, Friday? 

are you troubled because you may see your father?"  "No, no," says 

he, shaking his head, "no see him more:  no, never more see him 

again."  "Why so, Friday? how do you know that?"  "Oh no, Oh no," 

says Friday, "he long ago die, long ago; he much old man."  "Well, 

well, Friday, you don't know; but shall we see any one else, then?"  

The fellow, it seems, had better eyes than I, and he points to the 

hill just above my old house; and though we lay half a league off, 

he cries out, "We see! we see! yes, we see much man there, and 

there, and there."  I looked, but I saw nobody, no, not with a 

perspective glass, which was, I suppose, because I could not hit 

the place:  for the fellow was right, as I found upon inquiry the 

next day; and there were five or six men all together, who stood to 

look at the ship, not knowing what to think of us.



As soon as Friday told me he saw people, I caused the English 

ancient to be spread, and fired three guns, to give them notice we 

were friends; and in about a quarter of an hour after we perceived 

a smoke arise from the side of the creek; so I immediately ordered 

the boat out, taking Friday with me, and hanging out a white flag, 

I went directly on shore, taking with me the young friar I 

mentioned, to whom I had told the story of my living there, and the 

manner of it, and every particular both of myself and those I left 

there, and who was on that account extremely desirous to go with 

me.  We had, besides, about sixteen men well armed, if we had found 

any new guests there which we did not know of; but we had no need 

of weapons.



As we went on shore upon the tide of flood, near high water, we 

rowed directly into the creek; and the first man I fixed my eye 

upon was the Spaniard whose life I had saved, and whom I knew by 

his face perfectly well:  as to his habit, I shall describe it 

afterwards.  I ordered nobody to go on shore at first but myself; 

but there was no keeping Friday in the boat, for the affectionate 

creature had spied his father at a distance, a good way off the 

Spaniards, where, indeed, I saw nothing of him; and if they had not 

let him go ashore, he would have jumped into the sea.  He was no 

sooner on shore, but he flew away to his father like an arrow out 

of a bow.  It would have made any man shed tears, in spite of the 

firmest resolution, to have seen the first transports of this poor 

fellow's joy when he came to his father:  how he embraced him, 

kissed him, stroked his face, took him up in his arms, set him down 

upon a tree, and lay down by him; then stood and looked at him, as 

any one would look at a strange picture, for a quarter of an hour 

together; then lay down on the ground, and stroked his legs, and 

kissed them, and then got up again and stared at him; one would 

have thought the fellow bewitched.  But it would have made a dog 

laugh the next day to see how his passion ran out another way:  in 

the morning he walked along the shore with his father several 

hours, always leading him by the hand, as if he had been a lady; 

and every now and then he would come to the boat to fetch something 

or other for him, either a lump of sugar, a dram, a biscuit, or 

something or other that was good.  In the afternoon his frolics ran 

another way; for then he would set the old man down upon the 

ground, and dance about him, and make a thousand antic gestures; 

and all the while he did this he would be talking to him, and 

telling him one story or another of his travels, and of what had 

happened to him abroad to divert him.  In short, if the same filial 

affection was to be found in Christians to their parents in our 

part of the world, one would be tempted to say there would hardly 

have been any need of the fifth commandment.



But this is a digression:  I return to my landing.  It would be 

needless to take notice of all the ceremonies and civilities that 

the Spaniards received me with.  The first Spaniard, whom, as I 

said, I knew very well, was he whose life I had saved.  He came 

towards the boat, attended by one more, carrying a flag of truce 

also; and he not only did not know me at first, but he had no 

thoughts, no notion of its being me that was come, till I spoke to 

him.  "Seignior," said I, in Portuguese, "do you not know me?"  At 

which he spoke not a word, but giving his musket to the man that 

was with him, threw his arms abroad, saying something in Spanish 

that I did not perfectly hear, came forward and embraced me, 

telling me he was inexcusable not to know that face again that he 

had once seen, as of an angel from heaven sent to save his life; he 

said abundance of very handsome things, as a well-bred Spaniard 

always knows how, and then, beckoning to the person that attended 

him, bade him go and call out his comrades.  He then asked me if I 

would walk to my old habitation, where he would give me possession 

of my own house again, and where I should see they had made but 

mean improvements.  I walked along with him, but, alas! I could no 

more find the place than if I had never been there; for they had 

planted so many trees, and placed them in such a position, so thick 

and close to one another, and in ten years' time they were grown so 

big, that the place was inaccessible, except by such windings and 

blind ways as they themselves only, who made them, could find.



I asked them what put them upon all these fortifications; he told 

me I would say there was need enough of it when they had given me 

an account how they had passed their time since their arriving in 

the island, especially after they had the misfortune to find that I 

was gone.  He told me he could not but have some pleasure in my 

good fortune, when he heard that I was gone in a good ship, and to 

my satisfaction; and that he had oftentimes a strong persuasion 

that one time or other he should see me again, but nothing that 

ever befell him in his life, he said, was so surprising and 

afflicting to him at first as the disappointment he was under when 

he came back to the island and found I was not there.



As to the three barbarians (so he called them) that were left 

behind, and of whom, he said, he had a long story to tell me, the 

Spaniards all thought themselves much better among the savages, 

only that their number was so small:  "And," says he, "had they 

been strong enough, we had been all long ago in purgatory;" and 

with that he crossed himself on the breast.  "But, sir," says he, 

"I hope you will not be displeased when I shall tell you how, 

forced by necessity, we were obliged for our own preservation to 

disarm them, and make them our subjects, as they would not be 

content with being moderately our masters, but would be our 

murderers."  I answered I was afraid of it when I left them there, 

and nothing troubled me at my parting from the island but that they 

were not come back, that I might have put them in possession of 

everything first, and left the others in a state of subjection, as 

they deserved; but if they had reduced them to it I was very glad, 

and should be very far from finding any fault with it; for I knew 

they were a parcel of refractory, ungoverned villains, and were fit 

for any manner of mischief.



While I was saying this, the man came whom he had sent back, and 

with him eleven more.  In the dress they were in it was impossible 

to guess what nation they were of; but he made all clear, both to 

them and to me.  First, he turned to me, and pointing to them, 

said, "These, sir, are some of the gentlemen who owe their lives to 

you;" and then turning to them, and pointing to me, he let them 

know who I was; upon which they all came up, one by one, not as if 

they had been sailors, and ordinary fellows, and the like, but 

really as if they had been ambassadors or noblemen, and I a monarch 

or great conqueror:  their behaviour was, to the last degree, 

obliging and courteous, and yet mixed with a manly, majestic 

gravity, which very well became them; and, in short, they had so 

much more manners than I, that I scarce knew how to receive their 

civilities, much less how to return them in kind.



The history of their coming to, and conduct in, the island after my 

going away is so very remarkable, and has so many incidents which 

the former part of my relation will help to understand, and which 

will in most of the particulars, refer to the account I have 

already given, that I cannot but commit them, with great delight, 

to the reading of those that come after me.



In order to do this as intelligibly as I can, I must go back to the 

circumstances in which I left the island, and the persons on it, of 

whom I am to speak.  And first, it is necessary to repeat that I 

had sent away Friday's father and the Spaniard (the two whose lives 

I had rescued from the savages) in a large canoe to the main, as I 

then thought it, to fetch over the Spaniard's companions that he 

left behind him, in order to save them from the like calamity that 

he had been in, and in order to succour them for the present; and 

that, if possible, we might together find some way for our 

deliverance afterwards.  When I sent them away I had no visible 

appearance of, or the least room to hope for, my own deliverance, 

any more than I had twenty years before - much less had I any 

foreknowledge of what afterwards happened, I mean, of an English 

ship coming on shore there to fetch me off; and it could not be but 

a very great surprise to them, when they came back, not only to 

find that I was gone, but to find three strangers left on the spot, 

possessed of all that I had left behind me, which would otherwise 

have been their own.



The first thing, however, which I inquired into, that I might begin 

where I left off, was of their own part; and I desired the Spaniard 

would give me a particular account of his voyage back to his 

countrymen with the boat, when I sent him to fetch them over.  He 

told me there was little variety in that part, for nothing 

remarkable happened to them on the way, having had very calm 

weather and a smooth sea.  As for his countrymen, it could not be 

doubted, he said, but that they were overjoyed to see him (it seems 

he was the principal man among them, the captain of the vessel they 

had been shipwrecked in having been dead some time):  they were, he 

said, the more surprised to see him, because they knew that he was 

fallen into the hands of the savages, who, they were satisfied, 

would devour him as they did all the rest of their prisoners; that 

when he told them the story of his deliverance, and in what manner 

he was furnished for carrying them away, it was like a dream to 

them, and their astonishment, he said, was somewhat like that of 

Joseph's brethren when he told them who he was, and the story of 

his exaltation in Pharaoh's court; but when he showed them the 

arms, the powder, the ball, the provisions that he brought them for 

their journey or voyage, they were restored to themselves, took a 

just share of the joy of their deliverance, and immediately 

prepared to come away with him.



Their first business was to get canoes; and in this they were 

obliged not to stick so much upon the honesty of it, but to 

trespass upon their friendly savages, and to borrow two large 

canoes, or periaguas, on pretence of going out a-fishing, or for 

pleasure.  In these they came away the next morning.  It seems they 

wanted no time to get themselves ready; for they had neither 

clothes nor provisions, nor anything in the world but what they had 

on them, and a few roots to eat, of which they used to make their 

bread.  They were in all three weeks absent; and in that time, 

unluckily for them, I had the occasion offered for my escape, as I 

mentioned in the other part, and to get off from the island, 

leaving three of the most impudent, hardened, ungoverned, 

disagreeable villains behind me that any man could desire to meet 

with - to the poor Spaniards' great grief and disappointment.



The only just thing the rogues did was, that when the Spaniards 

came ashore, they gave my letter to them, and gave them provisions, 

and other relief, as I had ordered them to do; also they gave them 

the long paper of directions which I had left with them, containing 

the particular methods which I took for managing every part of my 

life there; the way I baked my bread, bred up tame goats, and 

planted my corn; how I cured my grapes, made my pots, and, in a 

word, everything I did.  All this being written down, they gave to 

the Spaniards (two of them understood English well enough):  nor 

did they refuse to accommodate the Spaniards with anything else, 

for they agreed very well for some time.  They gave them an equal 

admission into the house or cave, and they began to live very 

sociably; and the head Spaniard, who had seen pretty much of my 

methods, together with Friday's father, managed all their affairs; 

but as for the Englishmen, they did nothing but ramble about the 

island, shoot parrots, and catch tortoises; and when they came home 

at night, the Spaniards provided their suppers for them.



The Spaniards would have been satisfied with this had the others 

but let them alone, which, however, they could not find in their 

hearts to do long:  but, like the dog in the manger, they would not 

eat themselves, neither would they let the others eat.  The 

differences, nevertheless, were at first but trivial, and such as 

are not worth relating, but at last it broke out into open war:  

and it began with all the rudeness and insolence that can be 

imagined - without reason, without provocation, contrary to nature, 

and indeed to common sense; and though, it is true, the first 

relation of it came from the Spaniards themselves, whom I may call 

the accusers, yet when I came to examine the fellows they could not 

deny a word of it.



But before I come to the particulars of this part, I must supply a 

defect in my former relation; and this was, I forgot to set down 

among the rest, that just as we were weighing the anchor to set 

sail, there happened a little quarrel on board of our ship, which I 

was once afraid would have turned to a second mutiny; nor was it 

appeased till the captain, rousing up his courage, and taking us 

all to his assistance, parted them by force, and making two of the 

most refractory fellows prisoners, he laid them in irons:  and as 

they had been active in the former disorders, and let fall some 

ugly, dangerous words the second time, he threatened to carry them 

in irons to England, and have them hanged there for mutiny and 

running away with the ship.  This, it seems, though the captain did 

not intend to do it, frightened some other men in the ship; and 

some of them had put it into the head of the rest that the captain 

only gave them good words for the present, till they should come to 

same English port, and that then they should be all put into gaol, 

and tried for their lives.  The mate got intelligence of this, and 

acquainted us with it, upon which it was desired that I, who still 

passed for a great man among them, should go down with the mate and 

satisfy the men, and tell them that they might be assured, if they 

behaved well the rest of the voyage, all they had done for the time 

past should be pardoned.  So I went, and after passing my honour's 

word to them they appeared easy, and the more so when I caused the 

two men that were in irons to be released and forgiven.



But this mutiny had brought us to an anchor for that night; the 

wind also falling calm next morning, we found that our two men who 

had been laid in irons had stolen each of them a musket and some 

other weapons (what powder or shot they had we knew not), and had 

taken the ship's pinnace, which was not yet hauled up, and run away 

with her to their companions in roguery on shore.  As soon as we 

found this, I ordered the long-boat on shore, with twelve men and 

the mate, and away they went to seek the rogues; but they could 

neither find them nor any of the rest, for they all fled into the 

woods when they saw the boat coming on shore.  The mate was once 

resolved, in justice to their roguery, to have destroyed their 

plantations, burned all their household stuff and furniture, and 

left them to shift without it; but having no orders, he let it all 

alone, left everything as he found it, and bringing the pinnace 

way, came on board without them.  These two men made their number 

five; but the other three villains were so much more wicked than 

they, that after they had been two or three days together they 

turned the two newcomers out of doors to shift for themselves, and 

would have nothing to do with them; nor could they for a good while 

be persuaded to give them any food:  as for the Spaniards, they 

were not yet come.



When the Spaniards came first on shore, the business began to go 

forward:  the Spaniards would have persuaded the three English 

brutes to have taken in their countrymen again, that, as they said, 

they might be all one family; but they would not hear of it, so the 

two poor fellows lived by themselves; and finding nothing but 

industry and application would make them live comfortably, they 

pitched their tents on the north shore of the island, but a little 

more to the west, to be out of danger of the savages, who always 

landed on the east parts of the island.  Here they built them two 

huts, one to lodge in, and the other to lay up their magazines and 

stores in; and the Spaniards having given them some corn for seed, 

and some of the peas which I had left them, they dug, planted, and 

enclosed, after the pattern I had set for them all, and began to 

live pretty well.  Their first crop of corn was on the ground; and 

though it was but a little bit of land which they had dug up at 

first, having had but a little time, yet it was enough to relieve 

them, and find them with bread and other eatables; and one of the 

fellows being the cook's mate of the ship, was very ready at making 

soup, puddings, and such other preparations as the rice and the 

milk, and such little flesh as they got, furnished him to do.



They were going on in this little thriving position when the three 

unnatural rogues, their own countrymen too, in mere humour, and to 

insult them, came and bullied them, and told them the island was 

theirs:  that the governor, meaning me, had given them the 

possession of it, and nobody else had any right to it; and that 

they should build no houses upon their ground unless they would pay 

rent for them.  The two men, thinking they were jesting at first, 

asked them to come in and sit down, and see what fine houses they 

were that they had built, and to tell them what rent they demanded; 

and one of them merrily said if they were the ground-landlords, he 

hoped if they built tenements upon their land, and made 

improvements, they would, according to the custom of landlords, 

grant a long lease:  and desired they would get a scrivener to draw 

the writings.  One of the three, cursing and raging, told them they 

should see they were not in jest; and going to a little place at a 

distance, where the honest men had made a fire to dress their 

victuals, he takes a firebrand, and claps it to the outside of 

their hut, and set it on fire:  indeed, it would have been all 

burned down in a few minutes if one of the two had not run to the 

fellow, thrust him away, and trod the fire out with his feet, and 

that not without some difficulty too.



The fellow was in such a rage at the honest man's thrusting him 

away, that he returned upon him, with a pole he had in his hand, 

and had not the man avoided the blow very nimbly, and run into the 

hut, he had ended his days at once.  His comrade, seeing the danger 

they were both in, ran after him, and immediately they came both 

out with their muskets, and the man that was first struck at with 

the pole knocked the fellow down that began the quarrel with the 

stock of his musket, and that before the other two could come to 

help him; and then, seeing the rest come at them, they stood 

together, and presenting the other ends of their pieces to them, 

bade them stand off.



The others had firearms with them too; but one of the two honest 

men, bolder than his comrade, and made desperate by his danger, 

told them if they offered to move hand or foot they were dead men, 

and boldly commanded them to lay down their arms.  They did not, 

indeed, lay down their arms, but seeing him so resolute, it brought 

them to a parley, and they consented to take their wounded man with 

them and be gone:  and, indeed, it seems the fellow was wounded 

sufficiently with the blow.  However, they were much in the wrong, 

since they had the advantage, that they did not disarm them 

effectually, as they might have done, and have gone immediately to 

the Spaniards, and given them an account how the rogues had treated 

them; for the three villains studied nothing but revenge, and every 

day gave them some intimation that they did so.
