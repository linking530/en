	 by Daniel Defoe






CHAPTER I - REVISITS ISLAND







THAT homely proverb, used on so many occasions in England, viz. 

"That what is bred in the bone will not go out of the flesh," was 

never more verified than in the story of my Life.  Any one would 

think that after thirty-five years' affliction, and a variety of 

unhappy circumstances, which few men, if any, ever went through 

before, and after near seven years of peace and enjoyment in the 

fulness of all things; grown old, and when, if ever, it might be 

allowed me to have had experience of every state of middle life, 

and to know which was most adapted to make a man completely happy; 

I say, after all this, any one would have thought that the native 

propensity to rambling which I gave an account of in my first 

setting out in the world to have been so predominant in my 

thoughts, should be worn out, and I might, at sixty one years of 

age, have been a little inclined to stay at home, and have done 

venturing life and fortune any more.



Nay, farther, the common motive of foreign adventures was taken 

away in me, for I had no fortune to make; I had nothing to seek:  

if I had gained ten thousand pounds I had been no richer; for I had 

already sufficient for me, and for those I had to leave it to; and 

what I had was visibly increasing; for, having no great family, I 

could not spend the income of what I had unless I would set up for 

an expensive way of living, such as a great family, servants, 

equipage, gaiety, and the like, which were things I had no notion 

of, or inclination to; so that I had nothing, indeed, to do but to 

sit still, and fully enjoy what I had got, and see it increase 

daily upon my hands.  Yet all these things had no effect upon me, 

or at least not enough to resist the strong inclination I had to go 

abroad again, which hung about me like a chronic distemper.  In 

particular, the desire of seeing my new plantation in the island, 

and the colony I left there, ran in my head continually.  I dreamed 

of it all night, and my imagination ran upon it all day:  it was 

uppermost in all my thoughts, and my fancy worked so steadily and 

strongly upon it that I talked of it in my sleep; in short, nothing 

could remove it out of my mind:  it even broke so violently into 

all my discourses that it made my conversation tiresome, for I 

could talk of nothing else; all my discourse ran into it, even to 

impertinence; and I saw it myself.



I have often heard persons of good judgment say that all the stir 

that people make in the world about ghosts and apparitions is owing 

to the strength of imagination, and the powerful operation of fancy 

in their minds; that there is no such thing as a spirit appearing, 

or a ghost walking; that people's poring affectionately upon the 

past conversation of their deceased friends so realises it to them 

that they are capable of fancying, upon some extraordinary 

circumstances, that they see them, talk to them, and are answered 

by them, when, in truth, there is nothing but shadow and vapour in 

the thing, and they really know nothing of the matter.



For my part, I know not to this hour whether there are any such 

things as real apparitions, spectres, or walking of people after 

they are dead; or whether there is anything in the stories they 

tell us of that kind more than the product of vapours, sick minds, 

and wandering fancies:  but this I know, that my imagination worked 

up to such a height, and brought me into such excess of vapours, or 

what else I may call it, that I actually supposed myself often upon 

the spot, at my old castle, behind the trees; saw my old Spaniard, 

Friday's father, and the reprobate sailors I left upon the island; 

nay, I fancied I talked with them, and looked at them steadily, 

though I was broad awake, as at persons just before me; and this I 

did till I often frightened myself with the images my fancy 


represented to me.  One time, in my sleep, I had the villainy of 

the three pirate sailors so lively related to me by the first 

Spaniard, and Friday's father, that it was surprising:  they told 

me how they barbarously attempted to murder all the Spaniards, and 

that they set fire to the provisions they had laid up, on purpose 

to distress and starve them; things that I had never heard of, and 

that, indeed, were never all of them true in fact:  but it was so 

warm in my imagination, and so realised to me, that, to the hour I 

saw them, I could not be persuaded but that it was or would be 

true; also how I resented it, when the Spaniard complained to me; 

and how I brought them to justice, tried them, and ordered them all 

three to be hanged.  What there was really in this shall be seen in 

its place; for however I came to form such things in my dream, and 

what secret converse of spirits injected it, yet there was, I say, 

much of it true.  I own that this dream had nothing in it literally 

and specifically true; but the general part was so true - the base; 

villainous behaviour of these three hardened rogues was such, and 

had been so much worse than all I can describe, that the dream had 

too much similitude of the fact; and as I would afterwards have 

punished them severely, so, if I had hanged them all, I had been 

much in the right, and even should have been justified both by the 

laws of God and man.



But to return to my story.  In this kind of temper I lived some 

years; I had no enjoyment of my life, no pleasant hours, no 

agreeable diversion but what had something or other of this in it; 

so that my wife, who saw my mind wholly bent upon it, told me very 

seriously one night that she believed there was some secret, 

powerful impulse of Providence upon me, which had determined me to 

go thither again; and that she found nothing hindered me going but 

my being engaged to a wife and children.  She told me that it was 

true she could not think of parting with me:  but as she was 

assured that if she was dead it would be the first thing I would 

do, so, as it seemed to her that the thing was determined above, 

she would not be the only obstruction; for, if I thought fit and 

resolved to go - [Here she found me very intent upon her words, and 

that I looked very earnestly at her, so that it a little disordered 

her, and she stopped.  I asked her why she did not go on, and say 

out what she was going to say?  But I perceived that her heart was 

too full, and some tears stood in her eyes.]  "Speak out, my dear," 

said I; "are you willing I should go?" - "No," says she, very 

affectionately, "I am far from willing; but if you are resolved to 

go," says she, "rather than I would be the only hindrance, I will 

go with you:  for though I think it a most preposterous thing for 

one of your years, and in your condition, yet, if it must be," said 

she, again weeping, "I would not leave you; for if it be of Heaven 

you must do it, there is no resisting it; and if Heaven make it 

your duty to go, He will also make it mine to go with you, or 

otherwise dispose of me, that I may not obstruct it."



This affectionate behaviour of my wife's brought me a little out of 

the vapours, and I began to consider what I was doing; I corrected 

my wandering fancy, and began to argue with myself sedately what 

business I had after threescore years, and after such a life of 

tedious sufferings and disasters, and closed in so happy and easy a 

manner; I, say, what business had I to rush into new hazards, and 

put myself upon adventures fit only for youth and poverty to run 

into?



With those thoughts I considered my new engagement; that I had a 

wife, one child born, and my wife then great with child of another; 

that I had all the world could give me, and had no need to seek 

hazard for gain; that I was declining in years, and ought to think 

rather of leaving what I had gained than of seeking to increase it; 

that as to what my wife had said of its being an impulse from 

Heaven, and that it should be my duty to go, I had no notion of 

that; so, after many of these cogitations, I struggled with the 

power of my imagination, reasoned myself out of it, as I believe 

people may always do in like cases if they will:  in a word, I 

conquered it, composed myself with such arguments as occurred to my 

thoughts, and which my present condition furnished me plentifully 

with; and particularly, as the most effectual method, I resolved to 

divert myself with other things, and to engage in some business 

that might effectually tie me up from any more excursions of this 

kind; for I found that thing return upon me chiefly when I was 

idle, and had nothing to do, nor anything of moment immediately 

before me.  To this purpose, I bought a little farm in the county 

of Bedford, and resolved to remove myself thither.  I had a little 

convenient house upon it, and the land about it, I found, was 

capable of great improvement; and it was many ways suited to my 

inclination, which delighted in cultivating, managing, planting, 

and improving of land; and particularly, being an inland country, I 

was removed from conversing among sailors and things relating to 

the remote parts of the world.  I went down to my farm, settled my 

family, bought ploughs, harrows, a cart, waggon-horses, cows, and 

sheep, and, setting seriously to work, became in one half-year a 

mere country gentleman.  My thoughts were entirely taken up in 

managing my servants, cultivating the ground, enclosing, planting, 

&c.; and I lived, as I thought, the most agreeable life that nature 

was capable of directing, or that a man always bred to misfortunes 

was capable of retreating to.



I farmed upon my own land; I had no rent to pay, was limited by no 

articles; I could pull up or cut down as I pleased; what I planted 

was for myself, and what I improved was for my family; and having 

thus left off the thoughts of wandering, I had not the least 

discomfort in any part of life as to this world.  Now I thought, 

indeed, that I enjoyed the middle state of life which my father so 

earnestly recommended to me, and lived a kind of heavenly life, 

something like what is described by the poet, upon the subject of a 

country life:-





"Free from vices, free from care,

Age has no pain, and youth no snare."





But in the middle of all this felicity, one blow from unseen 

Providence unhinged me at once; and not only made a breach upon me 

inevitable and incurable, but drove me, by its consequences, into a 

deep relapse of the wandering disposition, which, as I may say, 

being born in my very blood, soon recovered its hold of me; and, 

like the returns of a violent distemper, came on with an 

irresistible force upon me.  This blow was the loss of my wife.  It 

is not my business here to write an elegy upon my wife, give a 

character of her particular virtues, and make my court to the sex 

by the flattery of a funeral sermon.  She was, in a few words, the 

stay of all my affairs; the centre of all my enterprises; the 

engine that, by her prudence, reduced me to that happy compass I 

was in, from the most extravagant and ruinous project that filled 

my head, and did more to guide my rambling genius than a mother's 

tears, a father's instructions, a friend's counsel, or all my own 

reasoning powers could do.  I was happy in listening to her, and in 

being moved by her entreaties; and to the last degree desolate and 

dislocated in the world by the loss of her.



When she was gone, the world looked awkwardly round me.  I was as 

much a stranger in it, in my thoughts, as I was in the Brazils, 

when I first went on shore there; and as much alone, except for the 

assistance of servants, as I was in my island.  I knew neither what 

to think nor what to do.  I saw the world busy around me:  one part 

labouring for bread, another part squandering in vile excesses or 

empty pleasures, but equally miserable because the end they 

proposed still fled from them; for the men of pleasure every day 

surfeited of their vice, and heaped up work for sorrow and 

repentance; and the men of labour spent their strength in daily 

struggling for bread to maintain the vital strength they laboured 

with:  so living in a daily circulation of sorrow, living but to 

work, and working but to live, as if daily bread were the only end 

of wearisome life, and a wearisome life the only occasion of daily 

bread.



This put me in mind of the life I lived in my kingdom, the island; 

where I suffered no more corn to grow, because I did not want it; 

and bred no more goats, because I had no more use for them; where 

the money lay in the drawer till it grew mouldy, and had scarce the 

favour to be looked upon in twenty years.  All these things, had I 

improved them as I ought to have done, and as reason and religion 

had dictated to me, would have taught me to search farther than 

human enjoyments for a full felicity; and that there was something 

which certainly was the reason and end of life superior to all 

these things, and which was either to be possessed, or at least 

hoped for, on this side of the grave.



But my sage counsellor was gone; I was like a ship without a pilot, 

that could only run afore the wind.  My thoughts ran all away again 

into the old affair; my head was quite turned with the whimsies of 

foreign adventures; and all the pleasant, innocent amusements of my 

farm, my garden, my cattle, and my family, which before entirely 

possessed me, were nothing to me, had no relish, and were like 

music to one that has no ear, or food to one that has no taste.  In 

a word, I resolved to leave off housekeeping, let my farm, and 

return to London; and in a few months after I did so.



When I came to London, I was still as uneasy as I was before; I had 

no relish for the place, no employment in it, nothing to do but to 

saunter about like an idle person, of whom it may be said he is 

perfectly useless in God's creation, and it is not one farthing's 

matter to the rest of his kind whether he be dead or alive.  This 

also was the thing which, of all circumstances of life, was the 

most my aversion, who had been all my days used to an active life; 

and I would often say to myself, "A state of idleness is the very 

dregs of life;" and, indeed, I thought I was much more suitably 

employed when I was twenty-six days making a deal board.



It was now the beginning of the year 1693, when my nephew, whom, as 

I have observed before, I had brought up to the sea, and had made 

him commander of a ship, was come home from a short voyage to 

Bilbao, being the first he had made.  He came to me, and told me 

that some merchants of his acquaintance had been proposing to him 

to go a voyage for them to the East Indies, and to China, as 

private traders.  "And now, uncle," says he, "if you will go to sea 

with me, I will engage to land you upon your old habitation in the 

island; for we are to touch at the Brazils."



Nothing can be a greater demonstration of a future state, and of 

the existence of an invisible world, than the concurrence of second 

causes with the idea of things which we form in our minds, 

perfectly reserved, and not communicated to any in the world.



My nephew knew nothing how far my distemper of wandering was 

returned upon me, and I knew nothing of what he had in his thought 

to say, when that very morning, before he came to me, I had, in a 

great deal of confusion of thought, and revolving every part of my 

circumstances in my mind, come to this resolution, that I would go 

to Lisbon, and consult with my old sea-captain; and if it was 

rational and practicable, I would go and see the island again, and 

what was become of my people there.  I had pleased myself with the 

thoughts of peopling the place, and carrying inhabitants from 

hence, getting a patent for the possession and I know not what; 

when, in the middle of all this, in comes my nephew, as I have 

said, with his project of carrying me thither in his way to the 

East Indies.



I paused a while at his words, and looking steadily at him, "What 

devil," said I, "sent you on this unlucky errand?"  My nephew 

stared as if he had been frightened at first; but perceiving that I 

was not much displeased at the proposal, he recovered himself.  "I 

hope it may not be an unlucky proposal, sir," says he.  "I daresay 

you would be pleased to see your new colony there, where you once 

reigned with more felicity than most of your brother monarchs in 

the world."  In a word, the scheme hit so exactly with my temper, 

that is to say, the prepossession I was under, and of which I have 

said so much, that I told him, in a few words, if he agreed with 

the merchants, I would go with him; but I told him I would not 

promise to go any further than my own island.  "Why, sir," says he, 

"you don't want to be left there again, I hope?"  "But," said I, 

"can you not take me up again on your return?"  He told me it would 

not be possible to do so; that the merchants would never allow him 

to come that way with a laden ship of such value, it being a 

month's sail out of his way, and might be three or four.  "Besides, 

sir, if I should miscarry," said he, "and not return at all, then 

you would be just reduced to the condition you were in before."



This was very rational; but we both found out a remedy for it, 

which was to carry a framed sloop on board the ship, which, being 

taken in pieces, might, by the help of some carpenters, whom we 

agreed to carry with us, be set up again in the island, and 

finished fit to go to sea in a few days.  I was not long resolving, 

for indeed the importunities of my nephew joined so effectually 

with my inclination that nothing could oppose me; on the other 

hand, my wife being dead, none concerned themselves so much for me 

as to persuade me one way or the other, except my ancient good 

friend the widow, who earnestly struggled with me to consider my 

years, my easy circumstances, and the needless hazards of a long 

voyage; and above all, my young children.  But it was all to no 

purpose, I had an irresistible desire for the voyage; and I told 

her I thought there was something so uncommon in the impressions I 

had upon my mind, that it would be a kind of resisting Providence 

if I should attempt to stay at home; after which she ceased her 

expostulations, and joined with me, not only in making provision 

for my voyage, but also in settling my family affairs for my 

absence, and providing for the education of my children.  In order 

to do this, I made my will, and settled the estate I had in such a 

manner for my children, and placed in such hands, that I was 

perfectly easy and satisfied they would have justice done them, 

whatever might befall me; and for their education, I left it wholly 

to the widow, with a sufficient maintenance to herself for her 

care:  all which she richly deserved; for no mother could have 

taken more care in their education, or understood it better; and as 

she lived till I came home, I also lived to thank her for it.



My nephew was ready to sail about the beginning of January 1694-5; 

and I, with my man Friday, went on board, in the Downs, the 8th; 

having, besides that sloop which I mentioned above, a very 

considerable cargo of all kinds of necessary things for my colony, 

which, if I did not find in good condition, I resolved to leave so.



First, I carried with me some servants whom I purposed to place 

there as inhabitants, or at least to set on work there upon my 

account while I stayed, and either to leave them there or carry 

them forward, as they should appear willing; particularly, I 

carried two carpenters, a smith, and a very handy, ingenious 

fellow, who was a cooper by trade, and was also a general mechanic; 

for he was dexterous at making wheels and hand-mills to grind corn, 

was a good turner and a good pot-maker; he also made anything that 

was proper to make of earth or of wood:  in a word, we called him 

our Jack-of-all-trades.  With these I carried a tailor, who had 

offered himself to go a passenger to the East Indies with my 

nephew, but afterwards consented to stay on our new plantation, and 

who proved a most necessary handy fellow as could be desired in 

many other businesses besides that of his trade; for, as I observed 

formerly, necessity arms us for all employments.



My cargo, as near as I can recollect, for I have not kept account 

of the particulars, consisted of a sufficient quantity of linen, 

and some English thin stuffs, for clothing the Spaniards that I 

expected to find there; and enough of them, as by my calculation 

might comfortably supply them for seven years; if I remember right, 

the materials I carried for clothing them, with gloves, hats, 

shoes, stockings, and all such things as they could want for 

wearing, amounted to about two hundred pounds, including some beds, 

bedding, and household stuff, particularly kitchen utensils, with 

pots, kettles, pewter, brass, &c.; and near a hundred pounds more 

in ironwork, nails, tools of every kind, staples, hooks, hinges, 

and every necessary thing I could think of.



I carried also a hundred spare arms, muskets, and fusees; besides 

some pistols, a considerable quantity of shot of all sizes, three 

or four tons of lead, and two pieces of brass cannon; and, because 

I knew not what time and what extremities I was providing for, I 

carried a hundred barrels of powder, besides swords, cutlasses, and 

the iron part of some pikes and halberds.  In short, we had a large 

magazine of all sorts of store; and I made my nephew carry two 

small quarter-deck guns more than he wanted for his ship, to leave 

behind if there was occasion; so that when we came there we might 

build a fort and man it against all sorts of enemies.  Indeed, I at 

first thought there would be need enough for all, and much more, if 

we hoped to maintain our possession of the island, as shall be seen 

in the course of that story.



I had not such bad luck in this voyage as I had been used to meet 

with, and therefore shall have the less occasion to interrupt the 

reader, who perhaps may be impatient to hear how matters went with 

my colony; yet some odd accidents, cross winds and bad weather 

happened on this first setting out, which made the voyage longer 

than I expected it at first; and I, who had never made but one 

voyage, my first voyage to Guinea, in which I might be said to come 

back again, as the voyage was at first designed, began to think the 

same ill fate attended me, and that I was born to be never 

contented with being on shore, and yet to be always unfortunate at 

sea.  Contrary winds first put us to the northward, and we were 

obliged to put in at Galway, in Ireland, where we lay wind-bound 

two-and-twenty days; but we had this satisfaction with the 

disaster, that provisions were here exceeding cheap, and in the 

utmost plenty; so that while we lay here we never touched the 

ship's stores, but rather added to them.  Here, also, I took in 

several live hogs, and two cows with their calves, which I 

resolved, if I had a good passage, to put on shore in my island; 

but we found occasion to dispose otherwise of them.



We set out on the 5th of February from Ireland, and had a very fair 

gale of wind for some days.  As I remember, it might be about the 

20th of February in the evening late, when the mate, having the 

watch, came into the round-house and told us he saw a flash of 

fire, and heard a gun fired; and while he was telling us of it, a 

boy came in and told us the boatswain heard another.  This made us 

all run out upon the quarter-deck, where for a while we heard 

nothing; but in a few minutes we saw a very great light, and found 

that there was some very terrible fire at a distance; immediately 

we had recourse to our reckonings, in which we all agreed that 

there could be no land that way in which the fire showed itself, 

no, not for five hundred leagues, for it appeared at WNW.  Upon 

this, we concluded it must be some ship on fire at sea; and as, by 

our hearing the noise of guns just before, we concluded that it 

could not be far off, we stood directly towards it, and were 

presently satisfied we should discover it, because the further we 

sailed, the greater the light appeared; though, the weather being 

hazy, we could not perceive anything but the light for a while.  In 

about half-an-hour's sailing, the wind being fair for us, though 

not much of it, and the weather clearing up a little, we could 

plainly discern that it was a great ship on fire in the middle of 

the sea.



I was most sensibly touched with this disaster, though not at all 

acquainted with the persons engaged in it; I presently recollected 

my former circumstances, and what condition I was in when taken up 

by the Portuguese captain; and how much more deplorable the 

circumstances of the poor creatures belonging to that ship must be, 

if they had no other ship in company with them.  Upon this I 

immediately ordered that five guns should be fired, one soon after 

another, that, if possible, we might give notice to them that there 

was help for them at hand and that they might endeavour to save 

themselves in their boat; for though we could see the flames of the 

ship, yet they, it being night, could see nothing of us.



We lay by some time upon this, only driving as the burning ship 

drove, waiting for daylight; when, on a sudden, to our great 

terror, though we had reason to expect it, the ship blew up in the 

air; and in a few minutes all the fire was out, that is to say, the 

rest of the ship sunk.  This was a terrible, and indeed an 

afflicting sight, for the sake of the poor men, who, I concluded, 

must be either all destroyed in the ship, or be in the utmost 

distress in their boat, in the middle of the ocean; which, at 

present, as it was dark, I could not see.  However, to direct them 

as well as I could, I caused lights to be hung out in all parts of 

the ship where we could, and which we had lanterns for, and kept 

firing guns all the night long, letting them know by this that 

there was a ship not far off.



About eight o'clock in the morning we discovered the ship's boats 

by the help of our perspective glasses, and found there were two of 

them, both thronged with people, and deep in the water.  We 

perceived they rowed, the wind being against them; that they saw 

our ship, and did their utmost to make us see them.  We immediately 

spread our ancient, to let them know we saw them, and hung a waft 

out, as a signal for them to come on board, and then made more 

sail, standing directly to them.  In little more than half-an-hour 

we came up with them; and took them all in, being no less than 

sixty-four men, women, and children; for there were a great many 

passengers.



Upon inquiry we found it was a French merchant ship of three-

hundred tons, home-bound from Quebec.  The master gave us a long 

account of the distress of his ship; how the fire began in the 

steerage by the negligence of the steersman, which, on his crying 

out for help, was, as everybody thought, entirely put out; but they 

soon found that some sparks of the first fire had got into some 

part of the ship so difficult to come at that they could not 

effectually quench it; and afterwards getting in between the 

timbers, and within the ceiling of the ship, it proceeded into the 

hold, and mastered all the skill and all the application they were 

able to exert.



They had no more to do then but to get into their boats, which, to 

their great comfort, were pretty large; being their long-boat, and 

a great shallop, besides a small skiff, which was of no great 

service to them, other than to get some fresh water and provisions 

into her, after they had secured their lives from the fire.  They 

had, indeed, small hopes of their lives by getting into these boats 

at that distance from any land; only, as they said, that they thus 

escaped from the fire, and there was a possibility that some ship 

might happen to be at sea, and might take them in.  They had sails, 

oars, and a compass; and had as much provision and water as, with 

sparing it so as to be next door to starving, might support them 

about twelve days, in which, if they had no bad weather and no 

contrary winds, the captain said he hoped he might get to the banks 

of Newfoundland, and might perhaps take some fish, to sustain them 

till they might go on shore.  But there were so many chances 

against them in all these cases, such as storms, to overset and 

founder them; rains and cold, to benumb and perish their limbs; 

contrary winds, to keep them out and starve them; that it must have 

been next to miraculous if they had escaped.



In the midst of their consternation, every one being hopeless and 

ready to despair, the captain, with tears in his eyes, told me they 

were on a sudden surprised with the joy of hearing a gun fire, and 

after that four more:  these were the five guns which I caused to 

be fired at first seeing the light.  This revived their hearts, and 

gave them the notice, which, as above, I desired it should, that 

there was a ship at hand for their help.  It was upon the hearing 

of these guns that they took down their masts and sails:  the sound 

coming from the windward, they resolved to lie by till morning.  

Some time after this, hearing no more guns, they fired three 

muskets, one a considerable while after another; but these, the 

wind being contrary, we never heard.  Some time after that again 

they were still more agreeably surprised with seeing our lights, 

and hearing the guns, which, as I have said, I caused to be fired 

all the rest of the night.  This set them to work with their oars, 

to keep their boats ahead, at least that we might the sooner come 

up with them; and at last, to their inexpressible joy, they found 

we saw them.



It is impossible for me to express the several gestures, the 

strange ecstasies, the variety of postures which these poor 

delivered people ran into, to express the joy of their souls at so 

unexpected a deliverance.  Grief and fear are easily described:  

sighs, tears, groans, and a very few motions of the head and hands, 

make up the sum of its variety; but an excess of joy, a surprise of 

joy, has a thousand extravagances in it.  There were some in tears; 

some raging and tearing themselves, as if they had been in the 

greatest agonies of sorrow; some stark raving and downright 

lunatic; some ran about the ship stamping with their feet, others 

wringing their hands; some were dancing, some singing, some 

laughing, more crying, many quite dumb, not able to speak a word; 

others sick and vomiting; several swooning and ready to faint; and 

a few were crossing themselves and giving God thanks.



I would not wrong them either; there might be many that were 

thankful afterwards; but the passion was too strong for them at 

first, and they were not able to master it:  then were thrown into 

ecstasies, and a kind of frenzy, and it was but a very few that 

were composed and serious in their joy.  Perhaps also, the case may 

have some addition to it from the particular circumstance of that 

nation they belonged to:  I mean the French, whose temper is 

allowed to be more volatile, more passionate, and more sprightly, 

and their spirits more fluid than in other nations.  I am not 

philosopher enough to determine the cause; but nothing I had ever 

seen before came up to it.  The ecstasies poor Friday, my trusty 

savage, was in when he found his father in the boat came the 

nearest to it; and the surprise of the master and his two 

companions, whom I delivered from the villains that set them on 

shore in the island, came a little way towards it; but nothing was 

to compare to this, either that I saw in Friday, or anywhere else 

in my life.



It is further observable, that these extravagances did not show 

themselves in that different manner I have mentioned, in different 

persons only; but all the variety would appear, in a short 

succession of moments, in one and the same person.  A man that we 

saw this minute dumb, and, as it were, stupid and confounded, would 

the next minute be dancing and hallooing like an antic; and the 

next moment be tearing his hair, or pulling his clothes to pieces, 

and stamping them under his feet like a madman; in a few moments 

after that we would have him all in tears, then sick, swooning, 

and, had not immediate help been had, he would in a few moments 

have been dead.  Thus it was, not with one or two, or ten or 

twenty, but with the greatest part of them; and, if I remember 

right, our surgeon was obliged to let blood of about thirty 

persons.



There were two priests among them:  one an old man, and the other a 

young man; and that which was strangest was, the oldest man was the 

worst.  As soon as he set his foot on board our ship, and saw 

himself safe, he dropped down stone dead to all appearance.  Not 

the least sign of life could be perceived in him; our surgeon 

immediately applied proper remedies to recover him, and was the 

only man in the ship that believed he was not dead.  At length he 

opened a vein in his arm, having first chafed and rubbed the part, 

so as to warm it as much as possible.  Upon this the blood, which 

only dropped at first, flowing freely, in three minutes after the 

man opened his eyes; a quarter of an hour after that he spoke, grew 

better, and after the blood was stopped, he walked about, told us 

he was perfectly well, and took a dram of cordial which the surgeon 

gave him.  About a quarter of an hour after this they came running 

into the cabin to the surgeon, who was bleeding a Frenchwoman that 

had fainted, and told him the priest was gone stark mad.  It seems 

he had begun to revolve the change of his circumstances in his 

mind, and again this put him into an ecstasy of joy.  His spirits 

whirled about faster than the vessels could convey them, the blood 

grew hot and feverish, and the man was as fit for Bedlam as any 

creature that ever was in it.  The surgeon would not bleed him 

again in that condition, but gave him something to doze and put him 

to sleep; which, after some time, operated upon him, and he awoke 

next morning perfectly composed and well.  The younger priest 

behaved with great command of his passions, and was really an 

example of a serious, well-governed mind.  At his first coming on 

board the ship he threw himself flat on his face, prostrating 

himself in thankfulness for his deliverance, in which I unhappily 

and unseasonably disturbed him, really thinking he had been in a 

swoon; but he spoke calmly, thanked me, told me he was giving God 

thanks for his deliverance, begged me to leave him a few moments, 

and that, next to his Maker, he would give me thanks also.  I was 

heartily sorry that I disturbed him, and not only left him, but 

kept others from interrupting him also.  He continued in that 

posture about three minutes, or little more, after I left him, then 

came to me, as he had said he would, and with a great deal of 

seriousness and affection, but with tears in his eyes, thanked me, 

that had, under God, given him and so many miserable creatures 

their lives.  I told him I had no need to tell him to thank God for 

it, rather than me, for I had seen that he had done that already; 

but I added that it was nothing but what reason and humanity 

dictated to all men, and that we had as much reason as he to give 

thanks to God, who had blessed us so far as to make us the 

instruments of His mercy to so many of His creatures.  After this 

the young priest applied himself to his countrymen, and laboured to 

compose them:  he persuaded, entreated, argued, reasoned with them, 

and did his utmost to keep them within the exercise of their 

reason; and with some he had success, though others were for a time 

out of all government of themselves.



I cannot help committing this to writing, as perhaps it may be 

useful to those into whose hands it may fall, for guiding 

themselves in the extravagances of their passions; for if an excess 

of joy can carry men out to such a length beyond the reach of their 

reason, what will not the extravagances of anger, rage, and a 

provoked mind carry us to?  And, indeed, here I saw reason for 

keeping an exceeding watch over our passions of every kind, as well 

those of joy and satisfaction as those of sorrow and anger.



We were somewhat disordered by these extravagances among our new 

guests for the first day; but after they had retired to lodgings 

provided for them as well as our ship would allow, and had slept 

heartily - as most of them did, being fatigued and frightened - 

they were quite another sort of people the next day.  Nothing of 

good manners, or civil acknowledgments for the kindness shown them, 

was wanting; the French, it is known, are naturally apt enough to 

exceed that way.  The captain and one of the priests came to me the 

next day, and desired to speak with me and my nephew; the commander 

began to consult with us what should be done with them; and first, 

they told us we had saved their lives, so all they had was little 

enough for a return to us for that kindness received.  The captain 

said they had saved some money and some things of value in their 

boats, caught hastily out of the flames, and if we would accept it 

they were ordered to make an offer of it all to us; they only 

desired to be set on shore somewhere in our way, where, if 

possible, they might get a passage to France.  My nephew wished to 

accept their money at first word, and to consider what to do with 

them afterwards; but I overruled him in that part, for I knew what 

it was to be set on shore in a strange country; and if the 

Portuguese captain that took me up at sea had served me so, and 

taken all I had for my deliverance, I must have been starved, or 

have been as much a slave at the Brazils as I had been at Barbary, 

the mere being sold to a Mahometan excepted; and perhaps a 

Portuguese is not a much better master than a Turk, if not in some 

cases much worse.



I therefore told the French captain that we had taken them up in 

their distress, it was true, but that it was our duty to do so, as 

we were fellow-creatures; and we would desire to be so delivered if 

we were in the like or any other extremity; that we had done 

nothing for them but what we believed they would have done for us 

if we had been in their case and they in ours; but that we took 

them up to save them, not to plunder them; and it would be a most 

barbarous thing to take that little from them which they had saved 

out of the fire, and then set them on shore and leave them; that 

this would be first to save them from death, and then kill them 

ourselves:  save them from drowning, and abandon them to starving; 

and therefore I would not let the least thing be taken from them.  

As to setting them on shore, I told them indeed that was an 

exceeding difficulty to us, for that the ship was bound to the East 

Indies; and though we were driven out of our course to the westward 

a very great way, and perhaps were directed by Heaven on purpose 

for their deliverance, yet it was impossible for us wilfully to 

change our voyage on their particular account; nor could my nephew, 

the captain, answer it to the freighters, with whom he was under 

charter to pursue his voyage by way of Brazil; and all I knew we 

could do for them was to put ourselves in the way of meeting with 

other ships homeward bound from the West Indies, and get them a 

passage, if possible, to England or France.



The first part of the proposal was so generous and kind they could 

not but be very thankful for it; but they were in very great 

consternation, especially the passengers, at the notion of being 

carried away to the East Indies; they then entreated me that as I 

was driven so far to the westward before I met with them, I would 

at least keep on the same course to the banks of Newfoundland, 

where it was probable I might meet with some ship or sloop that 

they might hire to carry them back to Canada.



I thought this was but a reasonable request on their part, and 

therefore I inclined to agree to it; for indeed I considered that 

to carry this whole company to the East Indies would not only be an 

intolerable severity upon the poor people, but would be ruining our 

whole voyage by devouring all our provisions; so I thought it no 

breach of charter-party, but what an unforeseen accident made 

absolutely necessary to us, and in which no one could say we were 

to blame; for the laws of God and nature would have forbid that we 

should refuse to take up two boats full of people in such a 

distressed condition; and the nature of the thing, as well 

respecting ourselves as the poor people, obliged us to set them on 

shore somewhere or other for their deliverance.  So I consented 

that we would carry them to Newfoundland, if wind and weather would 

permit:  and if not, I would carry them to Martinico, in the West 

Indies.



The wind continued fresh easterly, but the weather pretty good; and 

as the winds had continued in the points between NE. and SE. a long 

time, we missed several opportunities of sending them to France; 

for we met several ships bound to Europe, whereof two were French, 

from St. Christopher's, but they had been so long beating up 

against the wind that they durst take in no passengers, for fear of 

wanting provisions for the voyage, as well for themselves as for 

those they should take in; so we were obliged to go on.  It was 

about a week after this that we made the banks of Newfoundland; 

where, to shorten my story, we put all our French people on board a 

bark, which they hired at sea there, to put them on shore, and 

afterwards to carry them to France, if they could get provisions to 

victual themselves with.  When I say all the French went on shore, 

I should remember that the young priest I spoke of, hearing we were 

bound to the East Indies, desired to go the voyage with us, and to 

be set on shore on the coast of Coromandel; which I readily agreed 

to, for I wonderfully liked the man, and had very good reason, as 

will appear afterwards; also four of the seamen entered themselves 

on our ship, and proved very useful fellows.



From hence we directed our course for the West Indies, steering 

away S. and S. by E. for about twenty days together, sometimes 

little or no wind at all; when we met with another subject for our 

humanity to work upon, almost as deplorable as that before.
