AND now they had another broil with the three Englishmen; one of 

whom, a most turbulent fellow, being in a rage at one of the three 

captive slaves, because the fellow had not done something right 

which he bade him do, and seemed a little untractable in his 

showing him, drew a hatchet out of a frog-belt which he wore by his 

side, and fell upon the poor savage, not to correct him, but to 

kill him.  One of the Spaniards who was by, seeing him give the 

fellow a barbarous cut with the hatchet, which he aimed at his 

head, but stuck into his shoulder, so that he thought he had cut 

the poor creature's arm off, ran to him, and entreating him not to 

murder the poor man, placed himself between him and the savage, to 

prevent the mischief.  The fellow, being enraged the more at this, 

struck at the Spaniard with his hatchet, and swore he would serve 

him as he intended to serve the savage; which the Spaniard 

perceiving, avoided the blow, and with a shovel, which he had in 

his hand (for they were all working in the field about their corn 

land), knocked the brute down.  Another of the Englishmen, running 

up at the same time to help his comrade, knocked the Spaniard down; 

and then two Spaniards more came in to help their man, and a third 

Englishman fell in upon them.  They had none of them any firearms 

or any other weapons but hatchets and other tools, except this 

third Englishman; he had one of my rusty cutlasses, with which he 

made at the two last Spaniards, and wounded them both.  This fray 

set the whole family in an uproar, and more help coming in they 

took the three Englishmen prisoners.  The next question was, what 

should be done with them?  They had been so often mutinous, and 

were so very furious, so desperate, and so idle withal, they knew 

not what course to take with them, for they were mischievous to the 

highest degree, and cared not what hurt they did to any man; so 

that, in short, it was not safe to live with them.



The Spaniard who was governor told them, in so many words, that if 

they had been of his own country he would have hanged them; for all 

laws and all governors were to preserve society, and those who were 

dangerous to the society ought to be expelled out of it; but as 

they were Englishmen, and that it was to the generous kindness of 

an Englishman that they all owed their preservation and 

deliverance, he would use them with all possible lenity, and would 

leave them to the judgment of the other two Englishmen, who were 

their countrymen.  One of the two honest Englishmen stood up, and 

said they desired it might not be left to them.  "For," says he, "I 

am sure we ought to sentence them to the gallows;" and with that he 

gives an account how Will Atkins, one of the three, had proposed to 

have all the five Englishmen join together and murder all the 

Spaniards when they were in their sleep.



When the Spanish governor heard this, he calls to Will Atkins, 

"How, Seignior Atkins, would you murder us all?  What have you to 

say to that?"  The hardened villain was so far from denying it, 

that he said it was true, and swore they would do it still before 

they had done with them.  "Well, but Seignior Atkins," says the 

Spaniard, "what have we done to you that you will kill us?  What 

would you get by killing us?  And what must we do to prevent you 

killing us?  Must we kill you, or you kill us?  Why will you put us 

to the necessity of this, Seignior Atkins?" says the Spaniard very 

calmly, and smiling.  Seignior Atkins was in such a rage at the 

Spaniard's making a jest of it, that, had he not been held by three 

men, and withal had no weapon near him, it was thought he would 

have attempted to kill the Spaniard in the middle of all the 

company.  This hare-brained carriage obliged them to consider 

seriously what was to be done.  The two Englishmen and the Spaniard 

who saved the poor savage were of the opinion that they should hang 

one of the three for an example to the rest, and that particularly 

it should be he that had twice attempted to commit murder with his 

hatchet; indeed, there was some reason to believe he had done it, 

for the poor savage was in such a miserable condition with the 

wound he had received that it was thought he could not live.  But 

the governor Spaniard still said No; it was an Englishman that had 

saved all their lives, and he would never consent to put an 

Englishman to death, though he had murdered half of them; nay, he 

said if he had been killed himself by an Englishman, and had time 

left to speak, it should be that they should pardon him.



This was so positively insisted on by the governor Spaniard, that 

there was no gainsaying it; and as merciful counsels are most apt 

to prevail where they are so earnestly pressed, so they all came 

into it.  But then it was to be considered what should be done to 

keep them from doing the mischief they designed; for all agreed, 

governor and all, that means were to be used for preserving the 

society from danger.  After a long debate, it was agreed that they 

should be disarmed, and not permitted to have either gun, powder, 

shot, sword, or any weapon; that they should be turned out of the 

society, and left to live where they would and how they would, by 

themselves; but that none of the rest, either Spaniards or English, 

should hold any kind of converse with them, or have anything to do 

with them; that they should be forbid to come within a certain 

distance of the place where the rest dwelt; and if they offered to 

commit any disorder, so as to spoil, burn, kill, or destroy any of 

the corn, plantings, buildings, fences, or cattle belonging to the 

society, they should die without mercy, and they would shoot them 

wherever they could find them.



The humane governor, musing upon the sentence, considered a little 

upon it; and turning to the two honest Englishmen, said, "Hold; you 

must reflect that it will be long ere they can raise corn and 

cattle of their own, and they must not starve; we must therefore 

allow them provisions."  So he caused to be added, that they should 

have a proportion of corn given them to last them eight months, and 

for seed to sow, by which time they might be supposed to raise some 

of their own; that they should have six milch-goats, four he-goats, 

and six kids given them, as well for present subsistence as for a 

store; and that they should have tools given them for their work in 

the fields, but they should have none of these tools or provisions 

unless they would swear solemnly that they would not hurt or injure 

any of the Spaniards with them, or of their fellow-Englishmen.



Thus they dismissed them the society, and turned them out to shift 

for themselves.  They went away sullen and refractory, as neither 

content to go away nor to stay:  but, as there was no remedy, they 

went, pretending to go and choose a place where they would settle 

themselves; and some provisions were given them, but no weapons.  

About four or five days after, they came again for some victuals, 

and gave the governor an account where they had pitched their 

tents, and marked themselves out a habitation and plantation; and 

it was a very convenient place indeed, on the remotest part of the 

island, NE., much about the place where I providentially landed in 

my first voyage, when I was driven out to sea in my foolish attempt 

to sail round the island.



Here they built themselves two handsome huts, and contrived them in 

a manner like my first habitation, being close under the side of a 

hill, having some trees already growing on three sides of it, so 

that by planting others it would be very easily covered from the 

sight, unless narrowly searched for.  They desired some dried goat-

skins for beds and covering, which were given them; and upon giving 

their words that they would not disturb the rest, or injure any of 

their plantations, they gave them hatchets, and what other tools 

they could spare; some peas, barley, and rice, for sowing; and, in 

a word, anything they wanted, except arms and ammunition.



They lived in this separate condition about six months, and had got 

in their first harvest, though the quantity was but small, the 

parcel of land they had planted being but little.  Indeed, having 

all their plantation to form, they had a great deal of work upon 

their hands; and when they came to make boards and pots, and such 

things, they were quite out of their element, and could make 

nothing of it; therefore when the rainy season came on, for want of 

a cave in the earth, they could not keep their grain dry, and it 

was in great danger of spoiling.  This humbled them much:  so they 

came and begged the Spaniards to help them, which they very readily 

did; and in four days worked a great hole in the side of the hill 

for them, big enough to secure their corn and other things from the 

rain:  but it was a poor place at best compared to mine, and 

especially as mine was then, for the Spaniards had greatly enlarged 

it, and made several new apartments in it.



About three quarters of a year after this separation, a new frolic 

took these rogues, which, together with the former villainy they 

had committed, brought mischief enough upon them, and had very near 

been the ruin of the whole colony.  The three new associates began, 

it seems, to be weary of the laborious life they led, and that 

without hope of bettering their circumstances:  and a whim took 

them that they would make a voyage to the continent, from whence 

the savages came, and would try if they could seize upon some 

prisoners among the natives there, and bring them home, so as to 

make them do the laborious part of the work for them.



The project was not so preposterous, if they had gone no further.  

But they did nothing, and proposed nothing, but had either mischief 

in the design, or mischief in the event.  And if I may give my 

opinion, they seemed to be under a blast from Heaven:  for if we 

will not allow a visible curse to pursue visible crimes, how shall 

we reconcile the events of things with the divine justice?  It was 

certainly an apparent vengeance on their crime of mutiny and piracy 

that brought them to the state they were in; and they showed not 

the least remorse for the crime, but added new villanies to it, 

such as the piece of monstrous cruelty of wounding a poor slave 

because he did not, or perhaps could not, understand to do what he 

was directed, and to wound him in such a manner as made him a 

cripple all his life, and in a place where no surgeon or medicine 

could be had for his cure; and, what was still worse, the 

intentional murder, for such to be sure it was, as was afterwards 

the formed design they all laid to murder the Spaniards in cold 

blood, and in their sleep.



The three fellows came down to the Spaniards one morning, and in 

very humble terms desired to be admitted to speak with them.  The 

Spaniards very readily heard what they had to say, which was this:  

that they were tired of living in the manner they did, and that 

they were not handy enough to make the necessaries they wanted, and 

that having no help, they found they should be starved; but if the 

Spaniards would give them leave to take one of the canoes which 

they came over in, and give them arms and ammunition proportioned 

to their defence, they would go over to the main, and seek their 

fortunes, and so deliver them from the trouble of supplying them 

with any other provisions.



The Spaniards were glad enough to get rid of them, but very 

honestly represented to them the certain destruction they were 

running into; told them they had suffered such hardships upon that 

very spot, that they could, without any spirit of prophecy, tell 

them they would be starved or murdered, and bade them consider of 

it.  The men replied audaciously, they should be starved if they 

stayed here, for they could not work, and would not work, and they 

could but be starved abroad; and if they were murdered, there was 

an end of them; they had no wives or children to cry after them; 

and, in short, insisted importunately upon their demand, declaring 

they would go, whether they gave them any arms or not.



The Spaniards told them, with great kindness, that if they were 

resolved to go they should not go like naked men, and be in no 

condition to defend themselves; and that though they could ill 

spare firearms, not having enough for themselves, yet they would 

let them have two muskets, a pistol, and a cutlass, and each man a 

hatchet, which they thought was sufficient for them.  In a word, 

they accepted the offer; and having baked bread enough to serve 

them a month given them, and as much goats' flesh as they could eat 

while it was sweet, with a great basket of dried grapes, a pot of 

fresh water, and a young kid alive, they boldly set out in the 

canoe for a voyage over the sea, where it was at least forty miles 

broad.  The boat, indeed, was a large one, and would very well have 

carried fifteen or twenty men, and therefore was rather too big for 

them to manage; but as they had a fair breeze and flood-tide with 

them, they did well enough.  They had made a mast of a long pole, 

and a sail of four large goat-skins dried, which they had sewed or 

laced together; and away they went merrily together.  The Spaniards 

called after them "BON VOYAJO;" and no man ever thought of seeing 

them any more.



The Spaniards were often saying to one another, and to the two 

honest Englishmen who remained behind, how quietly and comfortably 

they lived, now these three turbulent fellows were gone.  As for 

their coming again, that was the remotest thing from their thoughts 

that could be imagined; when, behold, after two-and-twenty days' 

absence, one of the Englishmen being abroad upon his planting work, 

sees three strange men coming towards him at a distance, with guns 

upon their shoulders.



Away runs the Englishman, frightened and amazed, as if he was 

bewitched, to the governor Spaniard, and tells him they were all 

undone, for there were strangers upon the island, but he could not 

tell who they were.  The Spaniard, pausing a while, says to him, 

"How do you mean - you cannot tell who?  They are the savages, to 

be sure."  "No, no," says the Englishman, "they are men in clothes, 

with arms."  "Nay, then," says the Spaniard, "why are you so 

concerned!  If they are not savages they must be friends; for there 

is no Christian nation upon earth but will do us good rather than 

harm."  While they were debating thus, came up the three 

Englishmen, and standing without the wood, which was new planted, 

hallooed to them.  They presently knew their voices, and so all the 

wonder ceased.  But now the admiration was turned upon another 

question - What could be the matter, and what made them come back 

again?



It was not long before they brought the men in, and inquiring where 

they had been, and what they had been doing, they gave them a full 

account of their voyage in a few words:  that they reached the land 

in less than two days, but finding the people alarmed at their 

coming, and preparing with bows and arrows to fight them, they 

durst not go on, shore, but sailed on to the northward six or seven 

hours, till they came to a great opening, by which they perceived 

that the land they saw from our island was not the main, but an 

island:  that upon entering that opening of the sea they saw 

another island on the right hand north, and several more west; and 

being resolved to land somewhere, they put over to one of the 

islands which lay west, and went boldly on shore; that they found 

the people very courteous and friendly to them; and they gave them 

several roots and some dried fish, and appeared very sociable; and 

that the women, as well as the men, were very forward to supply 

them with anything they could get for them to eat, and brought it 

to them a great way, on their heads.  They continued here for four 

days, and inquired as well as they could of them by signs, what 

nations were this way, and that way, and were told of several 

fierce and terrible people that lived almost every way, who, as 

they made known by signs to them, used to eat men; but, as for 

themselves, they said they never ate men or women, except only such 

as they took in the wars; and then they owned they made a great 

feast, and ate their prisoners.



The Englishmen inquired when they had had a feast of that kind; and 

they told them about two moons ago, pointing to the moon and to two 

fingers; and that their great king had two hundred prisoners now, 

which he had taken in his war, and they were feeding them to make 

them fat for the next feast.  The Englishmen seemed mighty desirous 

of seeing those prisoners; but the others mistaking them, thought 

they were desirous to have some of them to carry away for their own 

eating.  So they beckoned to them, pointing to the setting of the 

sun, and then to the rising; which was to signify that the next 

morning at sunrising they would bring some for them; and 

accordingly the next morning they brought down five women and 

eleven men, and gave them to the Englishmen to carry with them on 

their voyage, just as we would bring so many cows and oxen down to 

a seaport town to victual a ship.



As brutish and barbarous as these fellows were at home, their 

stomachs turned at this sight, and they did not know what to do.  

To refuse the prisoners would have been the highest affront to the 

savage gentry that could be offered them, and what to do with them 

they knew not.  However, after some debate, they resolved to accept 

of them:  and, in return, they gave the savages that brought them 

one of their hatchets, an old key, a knife, and six or seven of 

their bullets; which, though they did not understand their use, 

they seemed particularly pleased with; and then tying the poor 

creatures' hands behind them, they dragged the prisoners into the 

boat for our men.



The Englishmen were obliged to come away as soon as they had them, 

or else they that gave them this noble present would certainly have 

expected that they should have gone to work with them, have killed 

two or three of them the next morning, and perhaps have invited the 

donors to dinner.  But having taken their leave, with all the 

respect and thanks that could well pass between people, where on 

either side they understood not one word they could say, they put 

off with their boat, and came back towards the first island; where, 

when they arrived, they set eight of their prisoners at liberty, 

there being too many of them for their occasion.  In their voyage 

they endeavoured to have some communication with their prisoners; 

but it was impossible to make them understand anything.  Nothing 

they could say to them, or give them, or do for them, but was 

looked upon as going to murder them.  They first of all unbound 

them; but the poor creatures screamed at that, especially the 

women, as if they had just felt the knife at their throats; for 

they immediately concluded they were unbound on purpose to be 

killed.  If they gave them thing to eat, it was the same thing; 

they then concluded it was for fear they should sink in flesh, and 

so not be fat enough to kill.  If they looked at one of them more 

particularly, the party presently concluded it was to see whether 

he or she was fattest, and fittest to kill first; nay, after they 

had brought them quite over, and began to use them kindly, and 

treat them well, still they expected every day to make a dinner or 

supper for their new masters.



When the three wanderers had give this unaccountable history or 

journal of their voyage, the Spaniard asked them where their new 

family was; and being told that they had brought them on shore, and 

put them into one of their huts, and were come up to beg some 

victuals for them, they (the Spaniards) and the other two 

Englishmen, that is to say, the whole colony, resolved to go all 

down to the place and see them; and did so, and Friday's father 

with them.  When they came into the hut, there they sat, all bound; 

for when they had brought them on shore they bound their hands that 

they might not take the boat and make their escape; there, I say, 

they sat, all of them stark naked.  First, there were three comely 

fellows, well shaped, with straight limbs, about thirty to thirty-

five years of age; and five women, whereof two might be from thirty 

to forty, two more about four or five and twenty; and the fifth, a 

tall, comely maiden, about seventeen.  The women were well-

favoured, agreeable persons, both in shape and features, only 

tawny; and two of them, had they been perfect white, would have 

passed for very handsome women, even in London, having pleasant 

countenances, and of a very modest behaviour; especially when they 

came afterwards to be clothed and dressed, though that dress was 

very indifferent, it must be confessed.



The sight, you may be sure, was something uncouth to our Spaniards, 

who were, to give them a just character, men of the most calm, 

sedate tempers, and perfect good humour, that ever I met with:  

and, in particular, of the utmost modesty:  I say, the sight was 

very uncouth, to see three naked men and five naked women, all 

together bound, and in the most miserable circumstances that human 

nature could be supposed to be, viz. to be expecting every moment 

to be dragged out and have their brains knocked out, and then to be 

eaten up like a calf that is killed for a dainty.



The first thing they did was to cause the old Indian, Friday's 

father, to go in, and see first if he knew any of them, and then if 

he understood any of their speech.  As soon as the old man came in, 

he looked seriously at them, but knew none of them; neither could 

any of them understand a word he said, or a sign he could make, 

except one of the women.  However, this was enough to answer the 

end, which was to satisfy them that the men into whose hands they 

were fallen were Christians; that they abhorred eating men or 

women; and that they might be sure they would not be killed.  As 

soon as they were assured of this, they discovered such a joy, and 

by such awkward gestures, several ways, as is hard to describe; for 

it seems they were of several nations.  The woman who was their 

interpreter was bid, in the next place, to ask them if they were 

willing to be servants, and to work for the men who had brought 

them away, to save their lives; at which they all fell a-dancing; 

and presently one fell to taking up this, and another that, 

anything that lay next, to carry on their shoulders, to intimate 

they were willing to work.



The governor, who found that the having women among them would 

presently be attended with some inconvenience, and might occasion 

some strife, and perhaps blood, asked the three men what they 

intended to do with these women, and how they intended to use them, 

whether as servants or as wives?  One of the Englishmen answered, 

very boldly and readily, that they would use them as both; to which 

the governor said:  "I am not going to restrain you from it - you 

are your own masters as to that; but this I think is but just, for 

avoiding disorders and quarrels among you, and I desire it of you 

for that reason only, viz. that you will all engage, that if any of 

you take any of these women as a wife, he shall take but one; and 

that having taken one, none else shall touch her; for though we 

cannot marry any one of you, yet it is but reasonable that, while 

you stay here, the woman any of you takes shall be maintained by 

the man that takes her, and should be his wife - I mean," says he, 

"while he continues here, and that none else shall have anything to 

do with her."  All this appeared so just, that every one agreed to 

it without any difficulty.



Then the Englishmen asked the Spaniards if they designed to take 

any of them?  But every one of them answered "No."  Some of them 

said they had wives in Spain, and the others did not like women 

that were not Christians; and all together declared that they would 

not touch one of them, which was an instance of such virtue as I 

have not met with in all my travels.  On the other hand, the five 

Englishmen took them every one a wife, that is to say, a temporary 

wife; and so they set up a new form of living; for the Spaniards 

and Friday's father lived in my old habitation, which they had 

enlarged exceedingly within.  The three servants which were taken 

in the last battle of the savages lived with them; and these 

carried on the main part of the colony, supplied all the rest with 

food, and assisted them in anything as they could, or as they found 

necessity required.



But the wonder of the story was, how five such refractory, ill-

matched fellows should agree about these women, and that some two 

of them should not choose the same woman, especially seeing two or 

three of them were, without comparison, more agreeable than the 

others; but they took a good way enough to prevent quarrelling 

among themselves, for they set the five women by themselves in one 

of their huts, and they went all into the other hut, and drew lots 

among them who should choose first.



Him that drew to choose first went away by himself to the hut where 

the poor naked creatures were, and fetched out her he chose; and it 

was worth observing, that he that chose first took her that was 

reckoned the homeliest and oldest of the five, which made mirth 

enough amongst the rest; and even the Spaniards laughed at it; but 

the fellow considered better than any of them, that it was 

application and business they were to expect assistance in, as much 

as in anything else; and she proved the best wife of all the 

parcel.



When the poor women saw themselves set in a row thus, and fetched 

out one by one, the terrors of their condition returned upon them 

again, and they firmly believed they were now going to be devoured.  

Accordingly, when the English sailor came in and fetched out one of 

them, the rest set up a most lamentable cry, and hung about her, 

and took their leave of her with such agonies and affection as 

would have grieved the hardest heart in the world:  nor was it 

possible for the Englishmen to satisfy them that they were not to 

be immediately murdered, till they fetched the old man, Friday's 

father, who immediately let them know that the five men, who were 

to fetch them out one by one, had chosen them for their wives.  

When they had done, and the fright the women were in was a little 

over, the men went to work, and the Spaniards came and helped them:  

and in a few hours they had built them every one a new hut or tent 

for their lodging apart; for those they had already were crowded 

with their tools, household stuff, and provisions.  The three 

wicked ones had pitched farthest off, and the two honest ones 

nearer, but both on the north shore of the island, so that they 

continued separated as before; and thus my island was peopled in 

three places, and, as I might say, three towns were begun to be 

built.



And here it is very well worth observing that, as it often happens 

in the world (what the wise ends in God's providence are, in such a 

disposition of things, I cannot say), the two honest fellows had 

the two worst wives; and the three reprobates, that were scarce 

worth hanging, that were fit for nothing, and neither seemed born 

to do themselves good nor any one else, had three clever, careful, 

and ingenious wives; not that the first two were bad wives as to 

their temper or humour, for all the five were most willing, quiet, 

passive, and subjected creatures, rather like slaves than wives; 

but my meaning is, they were not alike capable, ingenious, or 

industrious, or alike cleanly and neat.  Another observation I must 

make, to the honour of a diligent application on one hand, and to 

the disgrace of a slothful, negligent, idle temper on the other, 

that when I came to the place, and viewed the several improvements, 

plantings, and management of the several little colonies, the two 

men had so far out-gone the three, that there was no comparison.  

They had, indeed, both of them as much ground laid out for corn as 

they wanted, and the reason was, because, according to my rule, 

nature dictated that it was to no purpose to sow more corn than 

they wanted; but the difference of the cultivation, of the 

planting, of the fences, and indeed, of everything else, was easy 

to be seen at first view.



The two men had innumerable young trees planted about their huts, 

so that, when you came to the place, nothing was to be seen but a 

wood; and though they had twice had their plantation demolished, 

once by their own countrymen, and once by the enemy, as shall be 

shown in its place, yet they had restored all again, and everything 

was thriving and flourishing about them; they had grapes planted in 

order, and managed like a vineyard, though they had themselves 

never seen anything of that kind; and by their good ordering their 

vines, their grapes were as good again as any of the others.  They 

had also found themselves out a retreat in the thickest part of the 

woods, where, though there was not a natural cave, as I had found, 

yet they made one with incessant labour of their hands, and where, 

when the mischief which followed happened, they secured their wives 

and children so as they could never be found; they having, by 

sticking innumerable stakes and poles of the wood which, as I said, 

grew so readily, made the grove impassable, except in some places, 

when they climbed up to get over the outside part, and then went on 

by ways of their own leaving.



As to the three reprobates, as I justly call them, though they were 

much civilised by their settlement compared to what they were 

before, and were not so quarrelsome, having not the same 

opportunity; yet one of the certain companions of a profligate mind 

never left them, and that was their idleness.  It is true, they 

planted corn and made fences; but Solomon's words were never better 

verified than in them, "I went by the vineyard of the slothful, and 

it was all overgrown with thorns":  for when the Spaniards came to 

view their crop they could not see it in some places for weeds, the 

hedge had several gaps in it, where the wild goats had got in and 

eaten up the corn; perhaps here and there a dead bush was crammed 

in, to stop them out for the present, but it was only shutting the 

stable-door after the steed was stolen.  Whereas, when they looked 

on the colony of the other two, there was the very face of industry 

and success upon all they did; there was not a weed to be seen in 

all their corn, or a gap in any of their hedges; and they, on the 

other hand, verified Solomon's words in another place, "that the 

diligent hand maketh rich"; for everything grew and thrived, and 

they had plenty within and without; they had more tame cattle than 

the others, more utensils and necessaries within doors, and yet 

more pleasure and diversion too.



It is true, the wives of the three were very handy and cleanly 

within doors; and having learned the English ways of dressing, and 

cooking from one of the other Englishmen, who, as I said, was a 

cook's mate on board the ship, they dressed their husbands' 

victuals very nicely and well; whereas the others could not be 

brought to understand it; but then the husband, who, as I say, had 

been cook's mate, did it himself.  But as for the husbands of the 

three wives, they loitered about, fetched turtles' eggs, and caught 

fish and birds:  in a word, anything but labour; and they fared 

accordingly.  The diligent lived well and comfortably, and the 

slothful hard and beggarly; and so, I believe, generally speaking, 

it is all over the world.



But I now come to a scene different from all that had happened 

before, either to them or to me; and the origin of the story was 

this:  Early one morning there came on shore five or six canoes of 

Indians or savages, call them which you please, and there is no 

room to doubt they came upon the old errand of feeding upon their 

slaves; but that part was now so familiar to the Spaniards, and to 

our men too, that they did not concern themselves about it, as I 

did:  but having been made sensible, by their experience, that 

their only business was to lie concealed, and that if they were not 

seen by any of the savages they would go off again quietly, when 

their business was done, having as yet not the least notion of 

there being any inhabitants in the island; I say, having been made 

sensible of this, they had nothing to do but to give notice to all 

the three plantations to keep within doors, and not show 

themselves, only placing a scout in a proper place, to give notice 

when the boats went to sea again.



This was, without doubt, very right; but a disaster spoiled all 

these measures, and made it known among the savages that there were 

inhabitants there; which was, in the end, the desolation of almost 

the whole colony.  After the canoes with the savages were gone off, 

the Spaniards peeped abroad again; and some of them had the 

curiosity to go to the place where they had been, to see what they 

had been doing.  Here, to their great surprise, they found three 

savages left behind, and lying fast asleep upon the ground.  It was 

supposed they had either been so gorged with their inhuman feast, 

that, like beasts, they were fallen asleep, and would not stir when 

the others went, or they had wandered into the woods, and did not 

come back in time to be taken in.



The Spaniards were greatly surprised at this sight and perfectly at 

a loss what to do.  The Spaniard governor, as it happened, was with 

them, and his advice was asked, but he professed he knew not what 

to do.  As for slaves, they had enough already; and as to killing 

them, there were none of them inclined to do that:  the Spaniard 

governor told me they could not think of shedding innocent blood; 

for as to them, the poor creatures had done them no wrong, invaded 

none of their property, and they thought they had no just quarrel 

against them, to take away their lives.  And here I must, in 

justice to these Spaniards, observe that, let the accounts of 

Spanish cruelty in Mexico and Peru be what they will, I never met 

with seventeen men of any nation whatsoever, in any foreign 

country, who were so universally modest, temperate, virtuous, so 

very good-humoured, and so courteous, as these Spaniards:  and as 

to cruelty, they had nothing of it in their very nature; no 

inhumanity, no barbarity, no outrageous passions; and yet all of 

them men of great courage and spirit.  Their temper and calmness 

had appeared in their bearing the insufferable usage of the three 

Englishmen; and their justice and humanity appeared now in the case 

of the savages above.  After some consultation they resolved upon 

this; that they would lie still a while longer, till, if possible, 

these three men might be gone.  But then the governor recollected 

that the three savages had no boat; and if they were left to rove 

about the island, they would certainly discover that there were 

inhabitants in it; and so they should be undone that way.  Upon 

this, they went back again, and there lay the fellows fast asleep 

still, and so they resolved to awaken them, and take them 

prisoners; and they did so.  The poor fellows were strangely 

frightened when they were seized upon and bound; and afraid, like 

the women, that they should be murdered and eaten:  for it seems 

those people think all the world does as they do, in eating men's 

flesh; but they were soon made easy as to that, and away they 

carried them.



It was very happy for them that they did not carry them home to the 

castle, I mean to my palace under the hill; but they carried them 

first to the bower, where was the chief of their country work, such 

as the keeping the goats, the planting the corn, &c.; and afterward 

they carried them to the habitation of the two Englishmen.  Here 

they were set to work, though it was not much they had for them to 

do; and whether it was by negligence in guarding them, or that they 

thought the fellows could not mend themselves, I know not, but one 

of them ran away, and, taking to the woods, they could never hear 

of him any more.  They had good reason to believe he got home again 

soon after in some other boats or canoes of savages who came on 

shore three or four weeks afterwards, and who, carrying on their 

revels as usual, went off in two days' time.  This thought 

terrified them exceedingly; for they concluded, and that not 

without good cause indeed, that if this fellow came home safe among 

his comrades, he would certainly give them an account that there 

were people in the island, and also how few and weak they were; for 

this savage, as observed before, had never been told, and it was 

very happy he had not, how many there were or where they lived; nor 

had he ever seen or heard the fire of any of their guns, much less 

had they shown him any of their other retired places; such as the 

cave in the valley, or the new retreat which the two Englishmen had 

made, and the like.



The first testimony they had that this fellow had given 

intelligence of them was, that about two mouths after this six 

canoes of savages, with about seven, eight, or ten men in a canoe, 

came rowing along the north side of the island, where they never 

used to come before, and landed, about an hour after sunrise, at a 

convenient place, about a mile from the habitation of the two 

Englishmen, where this escaped man had been kept.  As the chief 

Spaniard said, had they been all there the damage would not have 

been so much, for not a man of them would have escaped; but the 

case differed now very much, for two men to fifty was too much 

odds.  The two men had the happiness to discover them about a 

league off, so that it was above an hour before they landed; and as 

they landed a mile from their huts, it was some time before they 

could come at them.  Now, having great reason to believe that they 

were betrayed, the first thing they did was to bind the two slaves 

which were left, and cause two of the three men whom they brought 

with the women (who, it seems, proved very faithful to them) to 

lead them, with their two wives, and whatever they could carry away 

with them, to their retired places in the woods, which I have 

spoken of above, and there to bind the two fellows hand and foot, 

till they heard farther.  In the next place, seeing the savages 

were all come on shore, and that they had bent their course 

directly that way, they opened the fences where the milch cows were 

kept, and drove them all out; leaving their goats to straggle in 

the woods, whither they pleased, that the savages might think they 

were all bred wild; but the rogue who came with them was too 

cunning for that, and gave them an account of it all, for they went 

directly to the place.



When the two poor frightened men had secured their wives and goods, 

they sent the other slave they had of the three who came with the 

women, and who was at their place by accident, away to the 

Spaniards with all speed, to give them the alarm, and desire speedy 

help, and, in the meantime, they took their arms and what 

ammunition they had, and retreated towards the place in the wood 

where their wives were sent; keeping at a distance, yet so that 

they might see, if possible, which way the savages took.  They had 

not gone far but that from a rising ground they could see the 

little army of their enemies come on directly to their habitation, 

and, in a moment more, could see all their huts and household stuff 

flaming up together, to their great grief and mortification; for 

this was a great loss to them, irretrievable, indeed, for some 

time.  They kept their station for a while, till they found the 

savages, like wild beasts, spread themselves all over the place, 

rummaging every way, and every place they could think of, in search 

of prey; and in particular for the people, of whom now it plainly 

appeared they had intelligence.



The two Englishmen seeing this, thinking themselves not secure 

where they stood, because it was likely some of the wild people 

might come that way, and they might come too many together, thought 

it proper to make another retreat about half a mile farther; 

believing, as it afterwards happened, that the further they 

strolled, the fewer would be together.  Their next halt was at the 

entrance into a very thick-grown part of the woods, and where an 

old trunk of a tree stood, which was hollow and very large; and in 

this tree they both took their standing, resolving to see there 

what might offer.  They had not stood there long before two of the 

savages appeared running directly that way, as if they had already 

had notice where they stood, and were coming up to attack them; and 

a little way farther they espied three more coming after them, and 

five more beyond them, all coming the same way; besides which, they 

saw seven or eight more at a distance, running another way; for in 

a word, they ran every way, like sportsmen beating for their game.



The poor men were now in great perplexity whether they should stand 

and keep their posture or fly; but after a very short debate with 

themselves, they considered that if the savages ranged the country 

thus before help came, they might perhaps find their retreat in the 

woods, and then all would be lost; so they resolved to stand them 

there, and if they were too many to deal with, then they would get 

up to the top of the tree, from whence they doubted not to defend 

themselves, fire excepted, as long as their ammunition lasted, 

though all the savages that were landed, which was near fifty, were 

to attack them.



Having resolved upon this, they next considered whether they should 

fire at the first two, or wait for the three, and so take the 

middle party, by which the two and the five that followed would be 

separated; at length they resolved to let the first two pass by, 

unless they should spy them the tree, and come to attack them.  The 

first two savages confirmed them also in this resolution, by 

turning a little from them towards another part of the wood; but 

the three, and the five after them, came forward directly to the 

tree, as if they had known the Englishmen were there.  Seeing them 

come so straight towards them, they resolved to take them in a line 

as they came:  and as they resolved to fire but one at a time, 

perhaps the first shot might hit them all three; for which purpose 

the man who was to fire put three or four small bullets into his 

piece; and having a fair loophole, as it were, from a broken hole 

in the tree, he took a sure aim, without being seen, waiting till 

they were within about thirty yards of the tree, so that he could 

not miss.



While they were thus waiting, and the savages came on, they plainly 

saw that one of the three was the runaway savage that had escaped 

from them; and they both knew him distinctly, and resolved that, if 

possible, he should not escape, though they should both fire; so 

the other stood ready with his piece, that if he did not drop at 

the first shot, he should be sure to have a second.  But the first 

was too good a marksman to miss his aim; for as the savages kept 

near one another, a little behind in a line, he fired, and hit two 

of them directly; the foremost was killed outright, being shot in 

the head; the second, which was the runaway Indian, was shot 

through the body, and fell, but was not quite dead; and the third 

had a little scratch in the shoulder, perhaps by the same ball that 

went through the body of the second; and being dreadfully 

frightened, though not so much hurt, sat down upon the ground, 

screaming and yelling in a hideous manner.



The five that were behind, more frightened with the noise than 

sensible of the danger, stood still at first; for the woods made 

the sound a thousand times bigger than it really was, the echoes 

rattling from one side to another, and the fowls rising from all 

parts, screaming, and every sort making a different noise, 

according to their kind; just as it was when I fired the first gun 

that perhaps was ever shot off in the island.



However, all being silent again, and they not knowing what the 

matter was, came on unconcerned, till they came to the place where 

their companions lay in a condition miserable enough.  Here the 

poor ignorant creatures, not sensible that they were within reach 

of the same mischief, stood all together over the wounded man, 

talking, and, as may be supposed, inquiring of him how he came to 

be hurt; and who, it is very rational to believe, told them that a 

flash of fire first, and immediately after that thunder from their 

gods, had killed those two and wounded him.  This, I say, is 

rational; for nothing is more certain than that, as they saw no man 

near them, so they had never heard a gun in all their lives, nor so 

much as heard of a gun; neither knew they anything of killing and 

wounding at a distance with fire and bullets:  if they had, one 

might reasonably believe they would not have stood so unconcerned 

to view the fate of their fellows, without some apprehensions of 

their own.



Our two men, as they confessed to me, were grieved to be obliged to 

kill so many poor creatures, who had no notion of their danger; 

yet, having them all thus in their power, and the first having 

loaded his piece again, resolved to let fly both together among 

them; and singling out, by agreement, which to aim at, they shot 

together, and killed, or very much wounded, four of them; the 

fifth, frightened even to death, though not hurt, fell with the 

rest; so that our men, seeing them all fall together, thought they 

had killed them all.



The belief that the savages were all killed made our two men come 

boldly out from the tree before they had charged their guns, which 

was a wrong step; and they were under some surprise when they came 

to the place, and found no less than four of them alive, and of 

them two very little hurt, and one not at all.  This obliged them 

to fall upon them with the stocks of their muskets; and first they 

made sure of the runaway savage, that had been the cause of all the 

mischief, and of another that was hurt in the knee, and put them 

out of their pain; then the man that was not hurt at all came and 

kneeled down to them, with his two hands held up, and made piteous 

moans to them, by gestures and signs, for his life, but could not 

say one word to them that they could understand.  However, they 

made signs to him to sit down at the foot of a tree hard by; and 

one of the Englishmen, with a piece of rope-yarn, which he had by 

great chance in his pocket, tied his two hands behind him, and 

there they left him; and with what speed they could made after the 

other two, which were gone before, fearing they, or any more of 

them, should find way to their covered place in the woods, where 

their wives, and the few goods they had left, lay.  They came once 

in sight of the two men, but it was at a great distance; however, 

they had the satisfaction to see them cross over a valley towards 

the sea, quite the contrary way from that which led to their 

retreat, which they were afraid of; and being satisfied with that, 

they went back to the tree where they left their prisoner, who, as 

they supposed, was delivered by his comrades, for he was gone, and 

the two pieces of rope-yarn with which they had bound him lay just 

at the foot of the tree.



They were now in as great concern as before, not knowing what 

course to take, or how near the enemy might be, or in what number; 

so they resolved to go away to the place where their wives were, to 

see if all was well there, and to make them easy.  These were in 

fright enough, to be sure; for though the savages were their own 

countrymen, yet they were most terribly afraid of them, and perhaps 

the more for the knowledge they had of them.  When they came there, 

they found the savages had been in the wood, and very near that 

place, but had not found it; for it was indeed inaccessible, from 

the trees standing so thick, unless the persons seeking it had been 

directed by those that knew it, which these did not:  they found, 

therefore, everything very safe, only the women in a terrible 

fright.  While they were here they had the comfort to have seven of 

the Spaniards come to their assistance; the other ten, with their 

servants, and Friday's father, were gone in a body to defend their 

bower, and the corn and cattle that were kept there, in case the 

savages should have roved over to that side of the country, but 

they did not spread so far.  With the seven Spaniards came one of 

the three savages, who, as I said, were their prisoners formerly; 

and with them also came the savage whom the Englishmen had left 

bound hand and foot at the tree; for it seems they came that way, 

saw the slaughter of the seven men, and unbound the eighth, and 

brought him along with them; where, however, they were obliged to 

bind again, as they had the two others who were left when the third 

ran away.



The prisoners now began to be a burden to them; and they were so 

afraid of their escaping, that they were once resolving to kill 

them all, believing they were under an absolute necessity to do so 

for their own preservation.  However, the chief of the Spaniards 

would not consent to it, but ordered, for the present, that they 

should be sent out of the way to my old cave in the valley, and be 

kept there, with two Spaniards to guard them, and have food for 

their subsistence, which was done; and they were bound there hand 

and foot for that night.



When the Spaniards came, the two Englishmen were so encouraged, 

that they could not satisfy themselves to stay any longer there; 

but taking five of the Spaniards, and themselves, with four muskets 

and a pistol among them, and two stout quarter-staves, away they 

went in quest of the savages.  And first they came to the tree 

where the men lay that had been killed; but it was easy to see that 

some more of the savages had been there, for they had attempted to 

carry their dead men away, and had dragged two of them a good way, 

but had given it over.  From thence they advanced to the first 

rising ground, where they had stood and seen their camp destroyed, 

and where they had the mortification still to see some of the 

smoke; but neither could they here see any of the savages.  They 

then resolved, though with all possible caution, to go forward 

towards their ruined plantation; but, a little before they came 

thither, coming in sight of the sea-shore, they saw plainly the 

savages all embarked again in their canoes, in order to be gone.  

They seemed sorry at first that there was no way to come at them, 

to give them a parting blow; but, upon the whole, they were very 

well satisfied to be rid of them.



The poor Englishmen being now twice ruined, and all their 

improvements destroyed, the rest all agreed to come and help them 

to rebuild, and assist them with needful supplies.  Their three 

countrymen, who were not yet noted for having the least inclination 

to do any good, yet as soon as they heard of it (for they, living 

remote eastward, knew nothing of the matter till all was over), 

came and offered their help and assistance, and did, very friendly, 

work for several days to restore their habitation and make 

necessaries for them.  And thus in a little time they were set upon 

their legs again.



About two days after this they had the farther satisfaction of 

seeing three of the savages' canoes come driving on shore, and, at 

some distance from them, two drowned men, by which they had reason 

to believe that they had met with a storm at sea, which had overset 

some of them; for it had blown very hard the night after they went 

off.  However, as some might miscarry, so, on the other hand, 

enough of them escaped to inform the rest, as well of what they had 

done as of what had happened to them; and to whet them on to 

another enterprise of the same nature, which they, it seems, 

resolved to attempt, with sufficient force to carry all before 

them; for except what the first man had told them of inhabitants, 

they could say little of it of their own knowledge, for they never 

saw one man; and the fellow being killed that had affirmed it, they 

had no other witness to confirm it to, them.
