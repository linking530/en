HAVING thus given an account of the colony in general, and pretty 

much of my runagate Englishmen, I must say something of the 

Spaniards, who were the main body of the family, and in whose story 

there are some incidents also remarkable enough.



I had a great many discourses with them about their circumstances 

when they were among the savages.  They told me readily that they 

had no instances to give of their application or ingenuity in that 

country; that they were a poor, miserable, dejected handful of 

people; that even if means had been put into their hands, yet they 

had so abandoned themselves to despair, and were so sunk under the 

weight of their misfortune, that they thought of nothing but 

starving.  One of them, a grave and sensible man, told me he was 

convinced they were in the wrong; that it was not the part of wise 

men to give themselves up to their misery, but always to take hold 

of the helps which reason offered, as well for present support as 

for future deliverance:  he told me that grief was the most 

senseless, insignificant passion in the world, for that it regarded 

only things past, which were generally impossible to be recalled or 

to be remedied, but had no views of things to come, and had no 

share in anything that looked like deliverance, but rather added to 

the affliction than proposed a remedy; and upon this he repeated a 

Spanish proverb, which, though I cannot repeat in the same words 

that he spoke it in, yet I remember I made it into an English 

proverb of my own, thus:-





"In trouble to be troubled,

Is to have your trouble doubled."





He then ran on in remarks upon all the little improvements I had 

made in my solitude:  my unwearied application, as he called it; 

and how I had made a condition, which in its circumstances was at 

first much worse than theirs, a thousand times more happy than 

theirs was, even now when they were all together.  He told me it 

was remarkable that Englishmen had a greater presence of mind in 

their distress than any people that ever he met with; that their 

unhappy nation and the Portuguese were the worst men in the world 

to struggle with misfortunes; for that their first step in dangers, 

after the common efforts were over, was to despair, lie down under 

it, and die, without rousing their thoughts up to proper remedies 

for escape.



I told him their case and mine differed exceedingly; that they were 

cast upon the shore without necessaries, without supply of food, or 

present sustenance till they could provide for it; that, it was 

true, I had this further disadvantage and discomfort, that I was 

alone; but then the supplies I had providentially thrown into my 

hands, by the unexpected driving of the ship on the shore, was such 

a help as would have encouraged any creature in the world to have 

applied himself as I had done.  "Seignior," says the Spaniard, "had 

we poor Spaniards been in your case, we should never have got half 

those things out of the ship, as you did:  nay," says he, "we 

should never have found means to have got a raft to carry them, or 

to have got the raft on shore without boat or sail:  and how much 

less should we have done if any of us had been alone!"  Well, I 

desired him to abate his compliments, and go on with the history of 

their coming on shore, where they landed.  He told me they 

unhappily landed at a place where there were people without 

provisions; whereas, had they had the common sense to put off to 

sea again, and gone to another island a little further, they had 

found provisions, though without people:  there being an island 

that way, as they had been told, where there were provisions, 

though no people - that is to say, that the Spaniards of Trinidad 

had frequently been there, and had filled the island with goats and 

hogs at several times, where they had bred in such multitudes, and 

where turtle and sea-fowls were in such plenty, that they could 

have been in no want of flesh, though they had found no bread; 

whereas, here they were only sustained with a few roots and herbs, 

which they understood not, and which had no substance in them, and 

which the inhabitants gave them sparingly enough; and they could 

treat them no better, unless they would turn cannibals and eat 

men's flesh.



They gave me an account how many ways they strove to civilise the 

savages they were with, and to teach them rational customs in the 

ordinary way of living, but in vain; and how they retorted upon 

them as unjust that they who came there for assistance and support 

should attempt to set up for instructors to those that gave them 

food; intimating, it seems, that none should set up for the 

instructors of others but those who could live without them.  They 

gave me dismal accounts of the extremities they were driven to; how 

sometimes they were many days without any food at all, the island 

they were upon being inhabited by a sort of savages that lived more 

indolent, and for that reason were less supplied with the 

necessaries of life, than they had reason to believe others were in 

the same part of the world; and yet they found that these savages 

were less ravenous and voracious than those who had better supplies 

of food.  Also, they added, they could not but see with what 

demonstrations of wisdom and goodness the governing providence of 

God directs the events of things in this world, which, they said, 

appeared in their circumstances:  for if, pressed by the hardships 

they were under, and the barrenness of the country where they were, 

they had searched after a better to live in, they had then been out 

of the way of the relief that happened to them by my means.



They then gave me an account how the savages whom they lived 

amongst expected them to go out with them into their wars; and, it 

was true, that as they had firearms with them, had they not had the 

disaster to lose their ammunition, they could have been serviceable 

not only to their friends, but have made themselves terrible both 

to friends and enemies; but being without powder and shot, and yet 

in a condition that they could not in reason decline to go out with 

their landlords to their wars; so when they came into the field of 

battle they were in a worse condition than the savages themselves, 

for they had neither bows nor arrows, nor could they use those the 

savages gave them.  So they could do nothing but stand still and be 

wounded with arrows, till they came up to the teeth of the enemy; 

and then, indeed, the three halberds they had were of use to them; 

and they would often drive a whole little army before them with 

those halberds, and sharpened sticks put into the muzzles of their 

muskets.  But for all this they were sometimes surrounded with 

multitudes, and in great danger from their arrows, till at last 

they found the way to make themselves large targets of wood, which 

they covered with skins of wild beasts, whose names they knew not, 

and these covered them from the arrows of the savages:  that, 

notwithstanding these, they were sometimes in great danger; and 

five of them were once knocked down together with the clubs of the 

savages, which was the time when one of them was taken prisoner - 

that is to say, the Spaniard whom I relieved.  At first they 

thought he had been killed; but when they afterwards heard he was 

taken prisoner, they were under the greatest grief imaginable, and 

would willingly have all ventured their lives to have rescued him.



They told me that when they were so knocked down, the rest of their 

company rescued them, and stood over them fighting till they were 

come to themselves, all but him whom they thought had been dead; 

and then they made their way with their halberds and pieces, 

standing close together in a line, through a body of above a 

thousand savages, beating down all that came in their way, got the 

victory over their enemies, but to their great sorrow, because it 

was with the loss of their friend, whom the other party finding 

alive, carried off with some others, as I gave an account before.  

They described, most affectionately, how they were surprised with 

joy at the return of their friend and companion in misery, who they 

thought had been devoured by wild beasts of the worst kind - wild 

men; and yet, how more and more they were surprised with the 

account he gave them of his errand, and that there was a Christian 

in any place near, much more one that was able, and had humanity 

enough, to contribute to their deliverance.



They described how they were astonished at the sight of the relief 

I sent them, and at the appearance of loaves of bread - things they 

had not seen since their coming to that miserable place; how often 

they crossed it and blessed it as bread sent from heaven; and what 

a reviving cordial it was to their spirits to taste it, as also the 

other things I had sent for their supply; and, after all, they 

would have told me something of the joy they were in at the sight 

of a boat and pilots, to carry them away to the person and place 

from whence all these new comforts came.  But it was impossible to 

express it by words, for their excessive joy naturally driving them 

to unbecoming extravagances, they had no way to describe them but 

by telling me they bordered upon lunacy, having no way to give vent 

to their passions suitable to the sense that was upon them; that in 

some it worked one way and in some another; and that some of them, 

through a surprise of joy, would burst into tears, others be stark 

mad, and others immediately faint.  This discourse extremely 

affected me, and called to my mind Friday's ecstasy when he met his 

father, and the poor people's ecstasy when I took them up at sea 

after their ship was on fire; the joy of the mate of the ship when 

he found himself delivered in the place where he expected to 

perish; and my own joy, when, after twenty-eight years' captivity, 

I found a good ship ready to carry me to my own country.  All these 

things made me more sensible of the relation of these poor men, and 

more affected with it.



Having thus given a view of the state of things as I found them, I 

must relate the heads of what I did for these people, and the 

condition in which I left them.  It was their opinion, and mine 

too, that they would be troubled no more with the savages, or if 

they were, they would be able to cut them off, if they were twice 

as many as before; so they had no concern about that.  Then I 

entered into a serious discourse with the Spaniard, whom I call 

governor, about their stay in the island; for as I was not come to 

carry any of them off, so it would not be just to carry off some 

and leave others, who, perhaps, would be unwilling to stay if their 

strength was diminished.  On the other hand, I told them I came to 

establish them there, not to remove them; and then I let them know 

that I had brought with me relief of sundry kinds for them; that I 

had been at a great charge to supply them with all things 

necessary, as well for their convenience as their defence; and that 

I had such and such particular persons with me, as well to increase 

and recruit their number, as by the particular necessary 

employments which they were bred to, being artificers, to assist 

them in those things in which at present they were in want.



They were all together when I talked thus to them; and before I 

delivered to them the stores I had brought, I asked them, one by 

one, if they had entirely forgot and buried the first animosities 

that had been among them, and would shake hands with one another, 

and engage in a strict friendship and union of interest, that so 

there might be no more misunderstandings and jealousies.



Will Atkins, with abundance of frankness and good humour, said they 

had met with affliction enough to make them all sober, and enemies 

enough to make them all friends; that, for his part, he would live 

and die with them, and was so far from designing anything against 

the Spaniards, that he owned they had done nothing to him but what 

his own mad humour made necessary, and what he would have done, and 

perhaps worse, in their case; and that he would ask them pardon, if 

I desired it, for the foolish and brutish things he had done to 

them, and was very willing and desirous of living in terms of 

entire friendship and union with them, and would do anything that 

lay in his power to convince them of it; and as for going to 

England, he cared not if he did not go thither these twenty years.



The Spaniards said they had, indeed, at first disarmed and excluded 

Will Atkins and his two countrymen for their ill conduct, as they 

had let me know, and they appealed to me for the necessity they 

were under to do so; but that Will Atkins had behaved himself so 

bravely in the great fight they had with the savages, and on 

several occasions since, and had showed himself so faithful to, and 

concerned for, the general interest of them all, that they had 

forgotten all that was past, and thought he merited as much to be 

trusted with arms and supplied with necessaries as any of them; 

that they had testified their satisfaction in him by committing the 

command to him next to the governor himself; and as they had entire 

confidence in him and all his countrymen, so they acknowledged they 

had merited that confidence by all the methods that honest men 

could merit to be valued and trusted; and they most heartily 

embraced the occasion of giving me this assurance, that they would 

never have any interest separate from one another.



Upon these frank and open declarations of friendship, we appointed 

the next day to dine all together; and, indeed, we made a splendid 

feast.  I caused the ship's cook and his mate to come on shore and 

dress our dinner, and the old cook's mate we had on shore assisted.  

We brought on shore six pieces of good beef and four pieces of 

pork, out of the ship's provisions, with our punch-bowl and 

materials to fill it; and in particular I gave them ten bottles of 

French claret, and ten bottles of English beer; things that neither 

the Spaniards nor the English had tasted for many years, and which 

it may be supposed they were very glad of.  The Spaniards added to 

our feast five whole kids, which the cooks roasted; and three of 

them were sent, covered up close, on board the ship to the seamen, 

that they might feast on fresh meat from on shore, as we did with 

their salt meat from on board.



After this feast, at which we were very innocently merry, I brought 

my cargo of goods; wherein, that there might be no dispute about 

dividing, I showed them that there was a sufficiency for them all, 

desiring that they might all take an equal quantity, when made up, 

of the goods that were for wearing.  As, first, I distributed linen 

sufficient to make every one of them four shirts, and, at the 

Spaniard's request, afterwards made them up six; these were 

exceeding comfortable to them, having been what they had long since 

forgot the use of, or what it was to wear them.  I allotted the 

thin English stuffs, which I mentioned before, to make every one a 

light coat, like a frock, which I judged fittest for the heat of 

the season, cool and loose; and ordered that whenever they decayed, 

they should make more, as they thought fit; the like for pumps, 

shoes, stockings, hats, &c.  I cannot express what pleasure sat 

upon the countenances of all these poor men when they saw the care 

I had taken of them, and how well I had furnished them.  They told 

me I was a father to them; and that having such a correspondent as 

I was in so remote a part of the world, it would make them forget 

that they were left in a desolate place; and they all voluntarily 

engaged to me not to leave the place without my consent.



Then I presented to them the people I had brought with me, 

particularly the tailor, the smith, and the two carpenters, all of 

them most necessary people; but, above all, my general artificer, 

than whom they could not name anything that was more useful to 

them; and the tailor, to show his concern for them, went to work 

immediately, and, with my leave, made them every one a shirt, the 

first thing he did; and, what was still more, he taught the women 

not only how to sew and stitch, and use the needle, but made them 

assist to make the shirts for their husbands, and for all the rest.  

As to the carpenters, I scarce need mention how useful they were; 

for they took to pieces all my clumsy, unhandy things, and made 

clever convenient tables, stools, bedsteads, cupboards, lockers, 

shelves, and everything they wanted of that kind.  But to let them 

see how nature made artificers at first, I carried the carpenters 

to see Will Atkins' basket-house, as I called it; and they both 

owned they never saw an instance of such natural ingenuity before, 

nor anything so regular and so handily built, at least of its kind; 

and one of them, when he saw it, after musing a good while, turning 

about to me, "I am sure," says he, "that man has no need of us; you 

need do nothing but give him tools."



Then I brought them out all my store of tools, and gave every man a 

digging-spade, a shovel, and a rake, for we had no barrows or 

ploughs; and to every separate place a pickaxe, a crow, a broad 

axe, and a saw; always appointing, that as often as any were broken 

or worn out, they should be supplied without grudging out of the 

general stores that I left behind.  Nails, staples, hinges, 

hammers, chisels, knives, scissors, and all sorts of ironwork, they 

had without reserve, as they required; for no man would take more 

than he wanted, and he must be a fool that would waste or spoil 

them on any account whatever; and for the use of the smith I left 

two tons of unwrought iron for a supply.



My magazine of powder and arms which I brought them was such, even 

to profusion, that they could not but rejoice at them; for now they 

could march as I used to do, with a musket upon each shoulder, if 

there was occasion; and were able to fight a thousand savages, if 

they had but some little advantages of situation, which also they 

could not miss, if they had occasion.



I carried on shore with me the young man whose mother was starved 

to death, and the maid also; she was a sober, well-educated, 

religious young woman, and behaved so inoffensively that every one 

gave her a good word; she had, indeed, an unhappy life with us, 

there being no woman in the ship but herself, but she bore it with 

patience.  After a while, seeing things so well ordered, and in so 

fine a way of thriving upon my island, and considering that they 

had neither business nor acquaintance in the East Indies, or reason 

for taking so long a voyage, both of them came to me and desired I 

would give them leave to remain on the island, and be entered among 

my family, as they called it.  I agreed to this readily; and they 

had a little plot of ground allotted to them, where they had three 

tents or houses set up, surrounded with a basket-work, palisadoed 

like Atkins's, adjoining to his plantation.  Their tents were 

contrived so that they had each of them a room apart to lodge in, 

and a middle tent like a great storehouse to lay their goods in, 

and to eat and to drink in.  And now the other two Englishmen 

removed their habitation to the same place; and so the island was 

divided into three colonies, and no more - viz. the Spaniards, with 

old Friday and the first servants, at my habitation under the hill, 

which was, in a word, the capital city, and where they had so 

enlarged and extended their works, as well under as on the outside 

of the hill, that they lived, though perfectly concealed, yet full 

at large.  Never was there such a little city in a wood, and so 

hid, in any part of the world; for I verify believe that a thousand 

men might have ranged the island a month, and, if they had not 

known there was such a thing, and looked on purpose for it, they 

would not have found it.  Indeed the trees stood so thick and so 

close, and grew so fast woven one into another, that nothing but 

cutting them down first could discover the place, except the only 

two narrow entrances where they went in and out could be found, 

which was not very easy; one of them was close down at the water's 

edge, on the side of the creek, and it was afterwards above two 

hundred yards to the place; and the other was up a ladder at twice, 

as I have already described it; and they had also a large wood, 

thickly planted, on the top of the hill, containing above an acre, 

which grew apace, and concealed the place from all discovery there, 

with only one narrow place between two trees, not easily to be 

discovered, to enter on that side.



The other colony was that of Will Atkins, where there were four 

families of Englishmen, I mean those I had left there, with their 

wives and children; three savages that were slaves, the widow and 

children of the Englishman that was killed, the young man and the 

maid, and, by the way, we made a wife of her before we went away.  

There were besides the two carpenters and the tailor, whom I 

brought with me for them:  also the smith, who was a very necessary 

man to them, especially as a gunsmith, to take care of their arms; 

and my other man, whom I called Jack-of-all-trades, who was in 

himself as good almost as twenty men; for he was not only a very 

ingenious fellow, but a very merry fellow, and before I went away 

we married him to the honest maid that came with the youth in the 

ship I mentioned before.



And now I speak of marrying, it brings me naturally to say 

something of the French ecclesiastic that I had brought with me out 

of the ship's crew whom I took up at sea.  It is true this man was 

a Roman, and perhaps it may give offence to some hereafter if I 

leave anything extraordinary upon record of a man whom, before I 

begin, I must (to set him out in just colours) represent in terms 

very much to his disadvantage, in the account of Protestants; as, 

first, that he was a Papist; secondly, a Popish priest; and 

thirdly, a French Popish priest.  But justice demands of me to give 

him a due character; and I must say, he was a grave, sober, pious, 

and most religious person; exact in his life, extensive in his 

charity, and exemplary in almost everything he did.  What then can 

any one say against being very sensible of the value of such a man, 

notwithstanding his profession? though it may be my opinion 

perhaps, as well as the opinion of others who shall read this, that 

he was mistaken.



The first hour that I began to converse with him after he had 

agreed to go with me to the East Indies, I found reason to delight 

exceedingly in his conversation; and he first began with me about 

religion in the most obliging manner imaginable.  "Sir," says he, 

"you have not only under God" (and at that he crossed his breast) 

"saved my life, but you have admitted me to go this voyage in your 

ship, and by your obliging civility have taken me into your family, 

giving me an opportunity of free conversation.  Now, sir, you see 

by my habit what my profession is, and I guess by your nation what 

yours is; I may think it is my duty, and doubtless it is so, to use 

my utmost endeavours, on all occasions, to bring all the souls I 

can to the knowledge of the truth, and to embrace the Catholic 

doctrine; but as I am here under your permission, and in your 

family, I am bound, in justice to your kindness as well as in 

decency and good manners, to be under your government; and 

therefore I shall not, without your leave, enter into any debate on 

the points of religion in which we may not agree, further than you 

shall give me leave."



I told him his carriage was so modest that I could not but 

acknowledge it; that it was true we were such people as they call 

heretics, but that he was not the first Catholic I had conversed 

with without falling into inconveniences, or carrying the questions 

to any height in debate; that he should not find himself the worse 

used for being of a different opinion from us, and if we did not 

converse without any dislike on either side, it should be his 

fault, not ours.



He replied that he thought all our conversation might be easily 

separated from disputes; that it was not his business to cap 

principles with every man he conversed with; and that he rather 

desired me to converse with him as a gentleman than as a 

religionist; and that, if I would give him leave at any time to 

discourse upon religious subjects, he would readily comply with it, 

and that he did not doubt but I would allow him also to defend his 

own opinions as well as he could; but that without my leave he 

would not break in upon me with any such thing.  He told me 

further, that he would not cease to do all that became him, in his 

office as a priest, as well as a private Christian, to procure the 

good of the ship, and the safety of all that was in her; and 

though, perhaps, we would not join with him, and he could not pray 

with us, he hoped he might pray for us, which he would do upon all 

occasions.  In this manner we conversed; and as he was of the most 

obliging, gentlemanlike behaviour, so he was, if I may be allowed 

to say so, a man of good sense, and, as I believe, of great 

learning.



He gave me a most diverting account of his life, and of the many 

extraordinary events of it; of many adventures which had befallen 

him in the few years that he had been abroad in the world; and 

particularly, it was very remarkable, that in the voyage he was now 

engaged in he had had the misfortune to be five times shipped and 

unshipped, and never to go to the place whither any of the ships he 

was in were at first designed.  That his first intent was to have 

gone to Martinico, and that he went on board a ship bound thither 

at St. Malo; but being forced into Lisbon by bad weather, the ship 

received some damage by running aground in the mouth of the river 

Tagus, and was obliged to unload her cargo there; but finding a 

Portuguese ship there bound for the Madeiras, and ready to sail, 

and supposing he should meet with a ship there bound to Martinico, 

he went on board, in order to sail to the Madeiras; but the master 

of the Portuguese ship being but an indifferent mariner, had been 

out of his reckoning, and they drove to Fayal; where, however, he 

happened to find a very good market for his cargo, which was corn, 

and therefore resolved not to go to the Madeiras, but to load salt 

at the Isle of May, and to go away to Newfoundland.  He had no 

remedy in this exigence but to go with the ship, and had a pretty 

good voyage as far as the Banks (so they call the place where they 

catch the fish), where, meeting with a French ship bound from 

France to Quebec, and from thence to Martinico, to carry 

provisions, he thought he should have an opportunity to complete 

his first design, but when he came to Quebec, the master of the 

ship died, and the vessel proceeded no further; so the next voyage 

he shipped himself for France, in the ship that was burned when we 

took them up at sea, and then shipped with us for the East Indies, 

as I have already said.  Thus he had been disappointed in five 

voyages; all, as I may call it, in one voyage, besides what I shall 

have occasion to mention further of him.



But I shall not make digression into other men's stories which have 

no relation to my own; so I return to what concerns our affair in 

the island.  He came to me one morning (for he lodged among us all 

the while we were upon the island), and it happened to be just when 

I was going to visit the Englishmen's colony, at the furthest part 

of the island; I say, he came to me, and told me, with a very grave 

countenance, that he had for two or three days desired an 

opportunity of some discourse with me, which he hoped would not be 

displeasing to me, because he thought it might in some measure 

correspond with my general design, which was the prosperity of my 

new colony, and perhaps might put it, at least more than he yet 

thought it was, in the way of God's blessing.



I looked a little surprised at the last of his discourse, and 

turning a little short, "How, sir," said I, "can it be said that we 

are not in the way of God's blessing, after such visible 

assistances and deliverances as we have seen here, and of which I 

have given you a large account?"  "If you had pleased, sir," said 

he, with a world of modesty, and yet great readiness, "to have 

heard me, you would have found no room to have been displeased, 

much less to think so hard of me, that I should suggest that you 

have not had wonderful assistances and deliverances; and I hope, on 

your behalf, that you are in the way of God's blessing, and your 

design is exceeding good, and will prosper.  But, sir, though it 

were more so than is even possible to you, yet there may be some 

among you that are not equally right in their actions:  and you 

know that in the story of the children of Israel, one Achan in the 

camp removed God's blessing from them, and turned His hand so 

against them, that six-and-thirty of them, though not concerned in 

the crime, were the objects of divine vengeance, and bore the 

weight of that punishment."



I was sensibly touched with this discourse, and told him his 

inference was so just, and the whole design seemed so sincere, and 

was really so religious in its own nature, that I was very sorry I 

had interrupted him, and begged him to go on; and, in the meantime, 

because it seemed that what we had both to say might take up some 

time, I told him I was going to the Englishmen's plantations, and 

asked him to go with me, and we might discourse of it by the way.  

He told me he would the more willingly wait on me thither, because 

there partly the thing was acted which he desired to speak to me 

about; so we walked on, and I pressed him to be free and plain with 

me in what he had to say.



"Why, then, sir," said he, "be pleased to give me leave to lay down 

a few propositions, as the foundation of what I have to say, that 

we may not differ in the general principles, though we may be of 

some differing opinions in the practice of particulars.  First, 

sir, though we differ in some of the doctrinal articles of religion 

(and it is very unhappy it is so, especially in the case before us, 

as I shall show afterwards), yet there are some general principles 

in which we both agree - that there is a God; and that this God 

having given us some stated general rules for our service and 

obedience, we ought not willingly and knowingly to offend Him, 

either by neglecting to do what He has commanded, or by doing what 

He has expressly forbidden.  And let our different religions be 

what they will, this general principle is readily owned by us all, 

that the blessing of God does not ordinarily follow presumptuous 

sinning against His command; and every good Christian will be 

affectionately concerned to prevent any that are under his care 

living in a total neglect of God and His commands.  It is not your 

men being Protestants, whatever my opinion may be of such, that 

discharges me from being concerned for their souls, and from 

endeavouring, if it lies before me, that they should live in as 

little distance from enmity with their Maker as possible, 

especially if you give me leave to meddle so far in your circuit."



I could not yet imagine what he aimed at, and told him I granted 

all he had said, and thanked him that he would so far concern 

himself for us:  and begged he would explain the particulars of 

what he had observed, that like Joshua, to take his own parable, I 

might put away the accursed thing from us.



"Why, then, sir," says he, "I will take the liberty you give me; 

and there are three things, which, if I am right, must stand in the 

way of God's blessing upon your endeavours here, and which I should 

rejoice, for your sake and their own, to see removed.  And, sir, I 

promise myself that you will fully agree with me in them all, as 

soon as I name them; especially because I shall convince you, that 

every one of them may, with great ease, and very much to your 

satisfaction, be remedied.  First, sir," says he, "you have here 

four Englishmen, who have fetched women from among the savages, and 

have taken them as their wives, and have had many children by them 

all, and yet are not married to them after any stated legal manner, 

as the laws of God and man require.  To this, sir, I know, you will 

object that there was no clergyman or priest of any kind to perform 

the ceremony; nor any pen and ink, or paper, to write down a 

contract of marriage, and have it signed between them.  And I know 

also, sir, what the Spaniard governor has told you, I mean of the 

agreement that he obliged them to make when they took those women, 

viz. that they should choose them out by consent, and keep 

separately to them; which, by the way, is nothing of a marriage, no 

agreement with the women as wives, but only an agreement among 

themselves, to keep them from quarrelling.  But, sir, the essence 

of the sacrament of matrimony" (so he called it, being a Roman) 

"consists not only in the mutual consent of the parties to take one 

another as man and wife, but in the formal and legal obligation 

that there is in the contract to compel the man and woman, at all 

times, to own and acknowledge each other; obliging the man to 

abstain from all other women, to engage in no other contract while 

these subsist; and, on all occasions, as ability allows, to provide 

honestly for them and their children; and to oblige the women to 

the same or like conditions, on their side.  Now, sir," says he, 

"these men may, when they please, or when occasion presents, 

abandon these women, disown their children, leave them to perish, 

and take other women, and marry them while these are living;" and 

here he added, with some warmth, "How, sir, is God honoured in this 

unlawful liberty?  And how shall a blessing succeed your endeavours 

in this place, however good in themselves, and however sincere in 

your design, while these men, who at present are your subjects, 

under your absolute government and dominion, are allowed by you to 

live in open adultery?"



I confess I was struck with the thing itself, but much more with 

the convincing arguments he supported it with; but I thought to 

have got off my young priest by telling him that all that part was 

done when I was not there:  and that they had lived so many years 

with them now, that if it was adultery, it was past remedy; nothing 

could be done in it now.



"Sir," says he, "asking your pardon for such freedom, you are right 

in this, that, it being done in your absence, you could not be 

charged with that part of the crime; but, I beseech you, flatter 

not yourself that you are not, therefore, under an obligation to do 

your utmost now to put an end to it.  You should legally and 

effectually marry them; and as, sir, my way of marrying may not be 

easy to reconcile them to, though it will be effectual, even by 

your own laws, so your way may be as well before God, and as valid 

among men.  I mean by a written contract signed by both man and 

woman, and by all the witnesses present, which all the laws of 

Europe would decree to be valid."



I was amazed to see so much true piety, and so much sincerity of 

zeal, besides the unusual impartiality in his discourse as to his 

own party or church, and such true warmth for preserving people 

that he had no knowledge of or relation to from transgressing the 

laws of God.  But recollecting what he had said of marrying them by 

a written contract, which I knew he would stand to, I returned it 

back upon him, and told him I granted all that he had said to be 

just, and on his part very kind; that I would discourse with the 

men upon the point now, when I came to them; and I knew no reason 

why they should scruple to let him marry them all, which I knew 

well enough would be granted to be as authentic and valid in 

England as if they were married by one of our own clergymen.



I then pressed him to tell me what was the second complaint which 

he had to make, acknowledging that I was very much his debtor for 

the first, and thanking him heartily for it.  He told me he would 

use the same freedom and plainness in the second, and hoped I would 

take it as well; and this was, that notwithstanding these English 

subjects of mine, as he called them, had lived with these women 

almost seven years, had taught them to speak English, and even to 

read it, and that they were, as he perceived, women of tolerable 

understanding, and capable of instruction, yet they had not, to 

this hour, taught them anything of the Christian religion - no, not 

so much as to know there was a God, or a worship, or in what manner 

God was to be served, or that their own idolatry, and worshipping 

they knew not whom, was false and absurd.  This he said was an 

unaccountable neglect, and what God would certainly call them to 

account for, and perhaps at last take the work out of their hands.  

He spoke this very affectionately and warmly.



"I am persuaded," says he, "had those men lived in the savage 

country whence their wives came, the savages would have taken more 

pains to have brought them to be idolaters, and to worship the 

devil, than any of these men, so far as I can see, have taken with 

them to teach the knowledge of the true God.  Now, sir," said he, 

"though I do not acknowledge your religion, or you mine, yet we 

would be glad to see the devil's servants and the subjects of his 

kingdom taught to know religion; and that they might, at least, 

hear of God and a Redeemer, and the resurrection, and of a future 

state - things which we all believe; that they might, at least, be 

so much nearer coming into the bosom of the true Church than they 

are now in the public profession of idolatry and devil-worship."



I could hold no longer:  I took him in my arms and embraced him 

eagerly.  "How far," said I to him, "have I been from understanding 

the most essential part of a Christian, viz. to love the interest 

of the Christian Church, and the good of other men's souls!  I 

scarce have known what belongs to the being a Christian." - "Oh, 

sir! do not say so," replied he; "this thing is not your fault." - 

"No," said I; "but why did I never lay it to heart as well as you?" 

- "It is not too late yet," said he; "be not too forward to condemn 

yourself." - "But what can be done now?" said I:  "you see I am 

going away." - "Will you give me leave to talk with these poor men 

about it?" - "Yes, with all my heart," said I:  "and oblige them to 

give heed to what you say too." - "As to that," said he, "we must 

leave them to the mercy of Christ; but it is your business to 

assist them, encourage them, and instruct them; and if you give me 

leave, and God His blessing, I do not doubt but the poor ignorant 

souls shall be brought home to the great circle of Christianity, if 

not into the particular faith we all embrace, and that even while 

you stay here."  Upon this I said, "I shall not only give you 

leave, but give you a thousand thanks for it."



I now pressed him for the third article in which we were to blame.  

"Why, really," says he, "it is of the same nature.  It is about 

your poor savages, who are, as I may say, your conquered subjects.  

It is a maxim, sir, that is or ought to be received among all 

Christians, of what church or pretended church soever, that the 

Christian knowledge ought to be propagated by all possible means 

and on all possible occasions.  It is on this principle that our 

Church sends missionaries into Persia, India, and China; and that 

our clergy, even of the superior sort, willingly engage in the most 

hazardous voyages, and the most dangerous residence amongst 

murderers and barbarians, to teach them the knowledge of the true 

God, and to bring them over to embrace the Christian faith.  Now, 

sir, you have such an opportunity here to have six or seven and 

thirty poor savages brought over from a state of idolatry to the 

knowledge of God, their Maker and Redeemer, that I wonder how you 

can pass such an occasion of doing good, which is really worth the 

expense of a man's whole life."



I was now struck dumb indeed, and had not one word to say.  I had 

here the spirit of true Christian zeal for God and religion before 

me.  As for me, I had not so much as entertained a thought of this 

in my heart before, and I believe I should not have thought of it; 

for I looked upon these savages as slaves, and people whom, had we 

not had any work for them to do, we would have used as such, or 

would have been glad to have transported them to any part of the 

world; for our business was to get rid of them, and we would all 

have been satisfied if they had been sent to any country, so they 

had never seen their own.  I was confounded at his discourse, and 

knew not what answer to make him.



He looked earnestly at me, seeing my confusion.  "Sir," says he, "I 

shall be very sorry if what I have said gives you any offence." - 

"No, no," said I,  "I am offended with nobody but myself; but I am 

perfectly confounded, not only to think that I should never take 

any notice of this before, but with reflecting what notice I am 

able to take of it now.  You know, sir," said I, "what 

circumstances I am in; I am bound to the East Indies in a ship 

freighted by merchants, and to whom it would be an insufferable 

piece of injustice to detain their ship here, the men lying all 

this while at victuals and wages on the owners' account.  It is 

true, I agreed to be allowed twelve days here, and if I stay more, 

I must pay three pounds sterling PER DIEM demurrage; nor can I stay 

upon demurrage above eight days more, and I have been here thirteen 

already; so that I am perfectly unable to engage in this work 

unless I would suffer myself to be left behind here again; in which 

case, if this single ship should miscarry in any part of her 

voyage, I should be just in the same condition that I was left in 

here at first, and from which I have been so wonderfully 

delivered."  He owned the case was very hard upon me as to my 

voyage; but laid it home upon my conscience whether the blessing of 

saving thirty-seven souls was not worth venturing all I had in the 

world for.  I was not so sensible of that as he was.  I replied to 

him thus:  "Why, sir, it is a valuable thing, indeed, to be an 

instrument in God's hand to convert thirty-seven heathens to the 

knowledge of Christ:  but as you are an ecclesiastic, and are given 

over to the work, so it seems so naturally to fall in the way of 

your profession; how is it, then, that you do not rather offer 

yourself to undertake it than to press me to do it?"



Upon this he faced about just before me, as he walked along, and 

putting me to a full stop, made me a very low bow.  "I most 

heartily thank God and you, sir," said he, "for giving me so 

evident a call to so blessed a work; and if you think yourself 

discharged from it, and desire me to undertake it, I will most 

readily do it, and think it a happy reward for all the hazards and 

difficulties of such a broken, disappointed voyage as I have met 

with, that I am dropped at last into so glorious a work."



I discovered a kind of rapture in his face while he spoke this to 

me; his eyes sparkled like fire; his face glowed, and his colour 

came and went; in a word, he was fired with the joy of being 

embarked in such a work.  I paused a considerable while before I 

could tell what to say to him; for I was really surprised to find a 

man of such sincerity, and who seemed possessed of a zeal beyond 

the ordinary rate of men.  But after I had considered it a while, I 

asked him seriously if he was in earnest, and that he would 

venture, on the single consideration of an attempt to convert those 

poor people, to be locked up in an unplanted island for perhaps his 

life, and at last might not know whether he should be able to do 

them good or not?  He turned short upon me, and asked me what I 

called a venture?  "Pray, sir," said he, "what do you think I 

consented to go in your ship to the East Indies for?" - "ay," said 

I, "that I know not, unless it was to preach to the Indians." - 

"Doubtless it was," said he; "and do you think, if I can convert 

these thirty-seven men to the faith of Jesus Christ, it is not 

worth my time, though I should never be fetched off the island 

again? - nay, is it not infinitely of more worth to save so many 

souls than my life is, or the life of twenty more of the same 

profession?  Yes, sir," says he, "I would give God thanks all my 

days if I could be made the happy instrument of saving the souls of 

those poor men, though I were never to get my foot off this island 

or see my native country any more.  But since you will honour me 

with putting me into this work, for which I will pray for you all 

the days of my life, I have one humble petition to you besides." - 

"What is that?" said I. - "Why," says he, "it is, that you will 

leave your man Friday with me, to be my interpreter to them, and to 

assist me; for without some help I cannot speak to them, or they to 

me."



I was sensibly touched at his requesting Friday, because I could 

not think of parting with him, and that for many reasons:  he had 

been the companion of my travels; he was not only faithful to me, 

but sincerely affectionate to the last degree; and I had resolved 

to do something considerable for him if he out-lived me, as it was 

probable he would.  Then I knew that, as I had bred Friday up to be 

a Protestant, it would quite confound him to bring him to embrace 

another religion; and he would never, while his eyes were open, 

believe that his old master was a heretic, and would be damned; and 

this might in the end ruin the poor fellow's principles, and so 

turn him back again to his first idolatry.  However, a sudden 

thought relieved me in this strait, and it was this:  I told him I 

could not say that I was willing to part with Friday on any account 

whatever, though a work that to him was of more value than his life 

ought to be of much more value than the keeping or parting with a 

servant.  On the other hand, I was persuaded that Friday would by 

no means agree to part with me; and I could not force him to it 

without his consent, without manifest injustice; because I had 

promised I would never send him away, and he had promised and 

engaged that he would never leave me, unless I sent him away.



He seemed very much concerned at it, for he had no rational access 

to these poor people, seeing he did not understand one word of 

their language, nor they one of his.  To remove this difficulty, I 

told him Friday's father had learned Spanish, which I found he also 

understood, and he should serve him as an interpreter.  So he was 

much better satisfied, and nothing could persuade him but he would 

stay and endeavour to convert them; but Providence gave another 

very happy turn to all this.



I come back now to the first part of his objections.  When we came 

to the Englishmen, I sent for them all together, and after some 

account given them of what I had done for them, viz. what necessary 

things I had provided for them, and how they were distributed, 

which they were very sensible of, and very thankful for, I began to 

talk to them of the scandalous life they led, and gave them a full 

account of the notice the clergyman had taken of it; and arguing 

how unchristian and irreligious a life it was, I first asked them 

if they were married men or bachelors?  They soon explained their 

condition to me, and showed that two of them were widowers, and the 

other three were single men, or bachelors.  I asked them with what 

conscience they could take these women, and call them their wives, 

and have so many children by them, and not be lawfully married to 

them?  They all gave me the answer I expected, viz. that there was 

nobody to marry them; that they agreed before the governor to keep 

them as their wives, and to maintain them and own them as their 

wives; and they thought, as things stood with them, they were as 

legally married as if they had been married by a parson and with 

all the formalities in the world.



I told them that no doubt they were married in the sight of God, 

and were bound in conscience to keep them as their wives; but that 

the laws of men being otherwise, they might desert the poor women 

and children hereafter; and that their wives, being poor desolate 

women, friendless and moneyless, would have no way to help 

themselves.  I therefore told them that unless I was assured of 

their honest intent, I could do nothing for them, but would take 

care that what I did should be for the women and children without 

them; and that, unless they would give me some assurances that they 

would marry the women, I could not think it was convenient they 

should continue together as man and wife; for that it was both 

scandalous to men and offensive to God, who they could not think 

would bless them if they went on thus.



All this went on as I expected; and they told me, especially Will 

Atkins, who now seemed to speak for the rest, that they loved their 

wives as well as if they had been born in their own native country, 

and would not leave them on any account whatever; and they did 

verily believe that their wives were as virtuous and as modest, and 

did, to the utmost of their skill, as much for them and for their 

children, as any woman could possibly do:  and they would not part 

with them on any account.  Will Atkins, for his own particular, 

added that if any man would take him away, and offer to carry him 

home to England, and make him captain of the best man-of-war in the 

navy, he would not go with him if he might not carry his wife and 

children with him; and if there was a clergyman in the ship, he 

would be married to her now with all his heart.



This was just as I would have it.  The priest was not with me at 

that moment, but he was not far off; so to try him further, I told 

him I had a clergyman with me, and, if he was sincere, I would have 

him married next morning, and bade him consider of it, and talk 

with the rest.  He said, as for himself, he need not consider of it 

at all, for he was very ready to do it, and was glad I had a 

minister with me, and he believed they would be all willing also.  

I then told him that my friend, the minister, was a Frenchman, and 

could not speak English, but I would act the clerk between them.  

He never so much as asked me whether he was a Papist or Protestant, 

which was, indeed, what I was afraid of.  We then parted, and I 

went back to my clergyman, and Will Atkins went in to talk with his 

companions.  I desired the French gentleman not to say anything to 

them till the business was thoroughly ripe; and I told him what 

answer the men had given me.



Before I went from their quarter they all came to me and told me 

they had been considering what I had said; that they were glad to 

hear I had a clergyman in my company, and they were very willing to 

give me the satisfaction I desired, and to be formally married as 

soon as I pleased; for they were far from desiring to part with 

their wives, and that they meant nothing but what was very honest 

when they chose them.  So I appointed them to meet me the next 

morning; and, in the meantime, they should let their wives know the 

meaning of the marriage law; and that it was not only to prevent 

any scandal, but also to oblige them that they should not forsake 

them, whatever might happen.



The women were easily made sensible of the meaning of the thing, 

and were very well satisfied with it, as, indeed, they had reason 

to be:  so they failed not to attend all together at my apartment 

next morning, where I brought out my clergyman; and though he had 

not on a minister's gown, after the manner of England, or the habit 

of a priest, after the manner of France, yet having a black vest 

something like a cassock, with a sash round it, he did not look 

very unlike a minister; and as for his language, I was his 

interpreter.  But the seriousness of his behaviour to them, and the 

scruples he made of marrying the women, because they were not 

baptized and professed Christians, gave them an exceeding reverence 

for his person; and there was no need, after that, to inquire 

whether he was a clergyman or not.  Indeed, I was afraid his 

scruples would have been carried so far as that he would not have 

married them at all; nay, notwithstanding all I was able to say to 

him, he resisted me, though modestly, yet very steadily, and at 

last refused absolutely to marry them, unless he had first talked 

with the men and the women too; and though at first I was a little 

backward to it, yet at last I agreed to it with a good will, 

perceiving the sincerity of his design.



When he came to them he let them know that I had acquainted him 

with their circumstances, and with the present design; that he was 

very willing to perform that part of his function, and marry them, 

as I had desired; but that before he could do it, he must take the 

liberty to talk with them.  He told them that in the sight of all 

indifferent men, and in the sense of the laws of society, they had 

lived all this while in a state of sin; and that it was true that 

nothing but the consenting to marry, or effectually separating them 

from one another, could now put an end to it; but there was a 

difficulty in it, too, with respect to the laws of Christian 

matrimony, which he was not fully satisfied about, that of marrying 

one that is a professed Christian to a savage, an idolater, and a 

heathen - one that is not baptized; and yet that he did not see 

that there was time left to endeavour to persuade the women to be 

baptized, or to profess the name of Christ, whom they had, he 

doubted, heard nothing of, and without which they could not be 

baptized.  He told them he doubted they were but indifferent 

Christians themselves; that they had but little knowledge of God or 

of His ways, and, therefore, he could not expect that they had said 

much to their wives on that head yet; but that unless they would 

promise him to use their endeavours with their wives to persuade 

them to become Christians, and would, as well as they could, 

instruct them in the knowledge and belief of God that made them, 

and to worship Jesus Christ that redeemed them, he could not marry 

them; for he would have no hand in joining Christians with savages, 

nor was it consistent with the principles of the Christian 

religion, and was, indeed, expressly forbidden in God's law.



They heard all this very attentively, and I delivered it very 

faithfully to them from his mouth, as near his own words as I 

could; only sometimes adding something of my own, to convince them 

how just it was, and that I was of his mind; and I always very 

carefully distinguished between what I said from myself and what 

were the clergyman's words.  They told me it was very true what the 

gentleman said, that they were very indifferent Christians 

themselves, and that they had never talked to their wives about 

religion.  "Lord, sir," says Will Atkins, "how should we teach them 

religion?  Why, we know nothing ourselves; and besides, sir," said 

he, "should we talk to them of God and Jesus Christ, and heaven and 

hell, it would make them laugh at us, and ask us what we believe 

ourselves.  And if we should tell them that we believe all the 

things we speak of to them, such as of good people going to heaven, 

and wicked people to the devil, they would ask us where we intend 

to go ourselves, that believe all this, and are such wicked fellows 

as we indeed are?  Why, sir; 'tis enough to give them a surfeit of 

religion at first hearing; folks must have some religion themselves 

before they begin to teach other people." - "Will Atkins," said I 

to him, "though I am afraid that what you say has too much truth in 

it, yet can you not tell your wife she is in the wrong; that there 

is a God and a religion better than her own; that her gods are 

idols; that they can neither hear nor speak; that there is a great 

Being that made all things, and that can destroy all that He has 

made; that He rewards the good and punishes the bad; and that we 

are to be judged by Him at last for all we do here?  You are not so 

ignorant but even nature itself will teach you that all this is 

true; and I am satisfied you know it all to be true, and believe it 

yourself." - "That is true, sir," said Atkins; "but with what face 

can I say anything to my wife of all this, when she will tell me 

immediately it cannot be true?" - "Not true!" said I; "what do you 

mean by that?" - "Why, sir," said he, "she will tell me it cannot 

be true that this God I shall tell her of can be just, or can 

punish or reward, since I am not punished and sent to the devil, 

that have been such a wicked creature as she knows I have been, 

even to her, and to everybody else; and that I should be suffered 

to live, that have been always acting so contrary to what I must 

tell her is good, and to what I ought to have done." - "Why, truly, 

Atkins," said I, "I am afraid thou speakest too much truth;" and 

with that I informed the clergyman of what Atkins had said, for he 

was impatient to know.  "Oh," said the priest, "tell him there is 

one thing will make him the best minister in the world to his wife, 

and that is repentance; for none teach repentance like true 

penitents.  He wants nothing but to repent, and then he will be so 

much the better qualified to instruct his wife; he will then be 

able to tell her that there is not only a God, and that He is the 

just rewarder of good and evil, but that He is a merciful Being, 

and with infinite goodness and long-suffering forbears to punish 

those that offend; waiting to be gracious, and willing not the 

death of a sinner, but rather that he should return and live; and 

even reserves damnation to the general day of retribution; that it 

is a clear evidence of God and of a future state that righteous men 

receive not their reward, or wicked men their punishment, till they 

come into another world; and this will lead him to teach his wife 

the doctrine of the resurrection and of the last judgment.  Let him 

but repent himself, he will be an excellent preacher of repentance 

to his wife."



I repeated all this to Atkins, who looked very serious all the 

while, and, as we could easily perceive, was more than ordinarily 

affected with it; when being eager, and hardly suffering me to make 

an end, "I know all this, master," says he, "and a great deal more; 

but I have not the impudence to talk thus to my wife, when God and 

my conscience know, and my wife will be an undeniable evidence 

against me, that I have lived as if I had never heard of a God or 

future state, or anything about it; and to talk of my repenting, 

alas!" (and with that he fetched a deep sigh, and I could see that 

the tears stood in his eyes) "'tis past all that with me." - "Past 

it, Atkins?" said I:  "what dost thou mean by that?" - "I know well 

enough what I mean," says he; "I mean 'tis too late, and that is 

too true."



I told the clergyman, word for word, what he said, and this 

affectionate man could not refrain from tears; but, recovering 

himself, said to me, "Ask him but one question.  Is he easy that it 

is too late; or is he troubled, and wishes it were not so?"  I put 

the question fairly to Atkins; and he answered with a great deal of 

passion, "How could any man be easy in a condition that must 

certainly end in eternal destruction? that he was far from being 

easy; but that, on the contrary, he believed it would one time or 

other ruin him." - "What do you mean by that?" said I. - "Why," he 

said, "he believed he should one time or other cut his throat, to 

put an end to the terror of it."



The clergyman shook his head, with great concern in his face, when 

I told him all this; but turning quick to me upon it, says, "If 

that be his case, we may assure him it is not too late; Christ will 

give him repentance.  But pray," says he, "explain this to him:  

that as no man is saved but by Christ, and the merit of His passion 

procuring divine mercy for him, how can it be too late for any man 

to receive mercy?  Does he think he is able to sin beyond the power 

or reach of divine mercy?  Pray tell him there may be a time when 

provoked mercy will no longer strive, and when God may refuse to 

hear, but that it is never too late for men to ask mercy; and we, 

that are Christ's servants, are commanded to preach mercy at all 

times, in the name of Jesus Christ, to all those that sincerely 

repent:  so that it is never too late to repent."



I told Atkins all this, and he heard me with great earnestness; but 

it seemed as if he turned off the discourse to the rest, for he 

said to me he would go and have some talk with his wife; so he went 

out a while, and we talked to the rest.  I perceived they were all 

stupidly ignorant as to matters of religion, as much as I was when 

I went rambling away from my father; yet there were none of them 

backward to hear what had been said; and all of them seriously 

promised that they would talk with their wives about it, and do 

their endeavours to persuade them to turn Christians.



The clergyman smiled upon me when I reported what answer they gave, 

but said nothing a good while; but at last, shaking his head, "We 

that are Christ's servants," says he, "can go no further than to 

exhort and instruct:  and when men comply, submit to the reproof, 

and promise what we ask, 'tis all we can do; we are bound to accept 

their good words; but believe me, sir," said he, "whatever you may 

have known of the life of that man you call Will Atkin's, I believe 

he is the only sincere convert among them:  I will not despair of 

the rest; but that man is apparently struck with the sense of his 

past life, and I doubt not, when he comes to talk of religion to 

his wife, he will talk himself effectually into it:  for attempting 

to teach others is sometimes the best way of teaching ourselves.  

If that poor Atkins begins but once to talk seriously of Jesus 

Christ to his wife, he will assuredly talk himself into a thorough 

convert, make himself a penitent, and who knows what may follow."



Upon this discourse, however, and their promising, as above, to 

endeavour to persuade their wives to embrace Christianity, he 

married the two other couple; but Will Atkins and his wife were not 

yet come in.  After this, my clergyman, waiting a while, was 

curious to know where Atkins was gone, and turning to me, said, "I 

entreat you, sir, let us walk out of your labyrinth here and look; 

I daresay we shall find this poor man somewhere or other talking 

seriously to his wife, and teaching her already something of 

religion."  I began to be of the same mind; so we went out 

together, and I carried him a way which none knew but myself, and 

where the trees were so very thick that it was not easy to see 

through the thicket of leaves, and far harder to see in than to see 

out:  when, coming to the edge of the wood, I saw Atkins and his 

tawny wife sitting under the shade of a bush, very eager in 

discourse:  I stopped short till my clergyman came up to me, and 

then having showed him where they were, we stood and looked very 

steadily at them a good while.  We observed him very earnest with 

her, pointing up to the sun, and to every quarter of the heavens, 

and then down to the earth, then out to the sea, then to himself, 

then to her, to the woods, to the trees.  "Now," says the 

clergyman, "you see my words are made good, the man preaches to 

her; mark him now, he is telling her that our God has made him, 

her, and the heavens, the earth, the sea, the woods, the trees, 

&c." - "I believe he is," said I.  Immediately we perceived Will 

Atkins start upon his feet, fall down on his knees, and lift up 

both his hands.  We supposed he said something, but we could not 

hear him; it was too far for that.  He did not continue kneeling 

half a minute, but comes and sits down again by his wife, and talks 

to her again; we perceived then the woman very attentive, but 

whether she said anything to him we could not tell.  While the poor 

fellow was upon his knees I could see the tears run plentifully 

down my clergyman's cheeks, and I could hardly forbear myself; but 

it was a great affliction to us both that we were not near enough 

to hear anything that passed between them.  Well, however, we could 

come no nearer for fear of disturbing them:  so we resolved to see 

an end of this piece of still conversation, and it spoke loud 

enough to us without the help of voice.  He sat down again, as I 

have said, close by her, and talked again earnestly to her, and two 

or three times we could see him embrace her most passionately; 

another time we saw him take out his handkerchief and wipe her 

eyes, and then kiss her again with a kind of transport very 

unusual; and after several of these things, we saw him on a sudden 

jump up again, and lend her his hand to help her up, when 

immediately leading her by the hand a step or two, they both 

kneeled down together, and continued so about two minutes.



My friend could bear it no longer, but cries out aloud, "St. Paul!  

St. Paul! behold he prayeth."  I was afraid Atkins would hear him, 

therefore I entreated him to withhold himself a while, that we 

might see an end of the scene, which to me, I must confess, was the 

most affecting that ever I saw in my life.  Well, he strove with 

himself for a while, but was in such raptures to think that the 

poor heathen woman was become a Christian, that he was not able to 

contain himself; he wept several times, then throwing up his hands 

and crossing his breast, said over several things ejaculatory, and 

by the way of giving God thanks for so miraculous a testimony of 

the success of our endeavours.  Some he spoke softly, and I could 

not well hear others; some things he said in Latin, some in French; 

then two or three times the tears would interrupt him, that he 

could not speak at all; but I begged that he would contain himself, 

and let us more narrowly and fully observe what was before us, 

which he did for a time, the scene not being near ended yet; for 

after the poor man and his wife were risen again from their knees, 

we observed he stood talking still eagerly to her, and we observed 

her motion, that she was greatly affected with what he said, by her 

frequently lifting up her hands, laying her hand to her breast, and 

such other postures as express the greatest seriousness and 

attention; this continued about half a quarter of an hour, and then 

they walked away, so we could see no more of them in that 

situation.



I took this interval to say to the clergyman, first, that I was 

glad to see the particulars we had both been witnesses to; that, 

though I was hard enough of belief in such cases, yet that I began 

to think it was all very sincere here, both in the man and his 

wife, however ignorant they might both be, and I hoped such a 

beginning would yet have a more happy end.  "But, my friend," added 

I, "will you give me leave to start one difficulty here?  I cannot 

tell how to object the least thing against that affectionate 

concern which you show for the turning of the poor people from 

their paganism to the Christian religion; but how does this comfort 

you, while these people are, in your account, out of the pale of 

the Catholic Church, without which you believe there is no 

salvation? so that you esteem these but heretics, as effectually 

lost as the pagans themselves."



To this he answered, with abundance of candour, thus:  "Sir, I am a 

Catholic of the Roman Church, and a priest of the order of St. 

Benedict, and I embrace all the principles of the Roman faith; but 

yet, if you will believe me, and that I do not speak in compliment 

to you, or in respect to my circumstances and your civilities; I 

say nevertheless, I do not look upon you, who call yourselves 

reformed, without some charity.  I dare not say (though I know it 

is our opinion in general) that you cannot be saved; I will by no 

means limit the mercy of Christ so far as think that He cannot 

receive you into the bosom of His Church, in a manner to us 

unperceivable; and I hope you have the same charity for us:  I pray 

daily for you being all restored to Christ's Church, by whatsoever 

method He, who is all-wise, is pleased to direct.  In the meantime, 

surely you will allow it consists with me as a Roman to distinguish 

far between a Protestant and a pagan; between one that calls on 

Jesus Christ, though in a way which I do not think is according to 

the true faith, and a savage or a barbarian, that knows no God, no 

Christ, no Redeemer; and if you are not within the pale of the 

Catholic Church, we hope you are nearer being restored to it than 

those who know nothing of God or of His Church:  and I rejoice, 

therefore, when I see this poor man, who you say has been a 

profligate, and almost a murderer kneel down and pray to Jesus 

Christ, as we suppose he did, though not fully enlightened; 

believing that God, from whom every such work proceeds, will 

sensibly touch his heart, and bring him to the further knowledge of 

that truth in His own time; and if God shall influence this poor 

man to convert and instruct the ignorant savage, his wife, I can 

never believe that he shall be cast away himself.  And have I not 

reason, then, to rejoice, the nearer any are brought to the 

knowledge of Christ, though they may not be brought quite home into 

the bosom of the Catholic Church just at the time when I desire it, 

leaving it to the goodness of Christ to perfect His work in His own 

time, and in his own way?  Certainly, I would rejoice if all the 

savages in America were brought, like this poor woman, to pray to 

God, though they were all to be Protestants at first, rather than 

they should continue pagans or heathens; firmly believing, that He 

that had bestowed the first light on them would farther illuminate 

them with a beam of His heavenly grace, and bring them into the 

pale of His Church when He should see good."
