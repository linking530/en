EARLY in the morning, when marching from a little town called 

Changu, we had a river to pass, which we were obliged to ferry; 

and, had the Tartars had any intelligence, then had been the time 

to have attacked us, when the caravan being over, the rear-guard 

was behind; but they did not appear there.  About three hours 

after, when we were entered upon a desert of about fifteen or 

sixteen miles over, we knew by a cloud of dust they raised, that 

the enemy was at hand, and presently they came on upon the spur.



Our Chinese guards in the front, who had talked so big the day 

before, began to stagger; and the soldiers frequently looked behind 

them, a certain sign in a soldier that he is just ready to run 

away.  My old pilot was of my mind; and being near me, called out, 

"Seignior Inglese, these fellows must be encouraged, or they will 

ruin us all; for if the Tartars come on they will never stand it." 

- "If am of your mind," said I; "but what must be done?" - "Done?" 

says he, "let fifty of our men advance, and flank them on each 

wing, and encourage them.  They will fight like brave fellows in 

brave company; but without this they will every man turn his back."  

Immediately I rode up to our leader and told him, who was exactly 

of our mind; accordingly, fifty of us marched to the right wing, 

and fifty to the left, and the rest made a line of rescue; and so 

we marched, leaving the last two hundred men to make a body of 

themselves, and to guard the camels; only that, if need were, they 

should send a hundred men to assist the last fifty.



At last the Tartars came on, and an innumerable company they were; 

how many we could not tell, but ten thousand, we thought, at the 

least.  A party of them came on first, and viewed our posture, 

traversing the ground in the front of our line; and, as we found 

them within gunshot, our leader ordered the two wings to advance 

swiftly, and give them a salvo on each wing with their shot, which 

was done.  They then went off, I suppose to give an account of the 

reception they were like to meet with; indeed, that salute cloyed 

their stomachs, for they immediately halted, stood a while to 

consider of it, and wheeling off to the left, they gave over their 

design for that time, which was very agreeable to our 

circumstances.



Two days after we came to the city of Naun, or Naum; we thanked the 

governor for his care of us, and collected to the value of a 

hundred crowns, or thereabouts, which we gave to the soldiers sent 

to guard us; and here we rested one day.  This is a garrison 

indeed, and there were nine hundred soldiers kept here; but the 

reason of it was, that formerly the Muscovite frontiers lay nearer 

to them than they now do, the Muscovites having abandoned that part 

of the country, which lies from this city west for about two 

hundred miles, as desolate and unfit for use; and more especially 

being so very remote, and so difficult to send troops thither for 

its defence; for we were yet above two thousand miles from Muscovy 

properly so called.  After this we passed several great rivers, and 

two dreadful deserts; one of which we were sixteen days passing 

over; and on the 13th of April we came to the frontiers of the 

Muscovite dominions.  I think the first town or fortress, whichever 

it may he called, that belonged to the Czar, was called Arguna, 

being on the west side of the river Arguna.



I could not but feel great satisfaction that I was arrived in a 

country governed by Christians; for though the Muscovites do, in my 

opinion, but just deserve the name of Christians, yet such they 

pretend to be, and are very devout in their way.  It would 

certainly occur to any reflecting man who travels the world as I 

have done, what a blessing it is to be brought into the world where 

the name of God and a Redeemer is known, adored, and worshipped; 

and not where the people, given up to strong delusions, worship the 

devil, and prostrate themselves to monsters, elements, horrid-

shaped animals, and monstrous images.  Not a town or city we passed 

through but had their pagodas, their idols, and their temples, and 

ignorant people worshipping even the works of their own hands.  Now 

we came where, at least, a face of the Christian worship appeared; 

where the knee was bowed to Jesus:  and whether ignorantly or not, 

yet the Christian religion was owned, and the name of the true God 

was called upon and adored; and it made my soul rejoice to see it.  

I saluted the brave Scots merchant with my first acknowledgment of 

this; and taking him by the hand, I said to him, "Blessed be God, 

we are once again amongst Christians."  He smiled, and answered, 

"Do not rejoice too soon, countryman; these Muscovites are but an 

odd sort of Christians; and but for the name of it you may see very 

little of the substance for some months further of our journey." - 

"Well," says I, "but still it is better than paganism, and 

worshipping of devils." - "Why, I will tell you," says he; "except 

the Russian soldiers in the garrisons, and a few of the inhabitants 

of the cities upon the road, all the rest of this country, for 

above a thousand miles farther, is inhabited by the worst and most 

ignorant of pagans."  And so, indeed, we found it.



We now launched into the greatest piece of solid earth that is to 

be found in any part of the world; we had, at least, twelve 

thousand miles to the sea eastward; two thousand to the bottom of 

the Baltic Sea westward; and above three thousand, if we left that 

sea, and went on west, to the British and French channels:  we had 

full five thousand miles to the Indian or Persian Sea south; and 

about eight hundred to the Frozen Sea north.



We advanced from the river Arguna by easy and moderate journeys, 

and were very visibly obliged to the care the Czar has taken to 

have cities and towns built in as many places as it is possible to 

place them, where his soldiers keep garrison, something like the 

stationary soldiers placed by the Romans in the remotest countries 

of their empire; some of which I had read of were placed in 

Britain, for the security of commerce, and for the lodging of 

travellers.  Thus it was here; for wherever we came, though at 

these towns and stations the garrisons and governors were Russians, 

and professed Christians, yet the inhabitants were mere pagans, 

sacrificing to idols, and worshipping the sun, moon, and stars, or 

all the host of heaven; and not only so, but were, of all the 

heathens and pagans that ever I met with, the most barbarous, 

except only that they did not eat men's flesh.



Some instances of this we met with in the country between Arguna, 

where we enter the Muscovite dominions, and a city of Tartars and 

Russians together, called Nortziousky, in which is a continued 

desert or forest, which cost us twenty days to travel over.  In a 

village near the last of these places I had the curiosity to go and 

see their way of living, which is most brutish and unsufferable.  

They had, I suppose, a great sacrifice that day; for there stood 

out, upon an old stump of a tree, a diabolical kind of idol made of 

wood; it was dressed up, too, in the most filthy manner; its upper 

garment was of sheepskins, with the wool outward; a great Tartar 

bonnet on the head, with two horns growing through it; it was about 

eight feet high, yet had no feet or legs, nor any other proportion 

of parts.



This scarecrow was set up at the outer side of the village; and 

when I came near to it there were sixteen or seventeen creatures 

all lying flat upon the ground round this hideous block of wood; I 

saw no motion among them, any more than if they had been all logs, 

like the idol, and at first I really thought they had been so; but, 

when I came a little nearer, they started up upon their feet, and 

raised a howl, as if it had been so many deep-mouthed hounds, and 

walked away, as if they were displeased at our disturbing them.  A 

little way off from the idol, and at the door of a hut, made of 

sheep and cow skins dried, stood three men with long knives in 

their hands; and in the middle of the tent appeared three sheep 

killed, and one young bullock.  These, it seems, were sacrifices to 

that senseless log of an idol; the three men were priests belonging 

to it, and the seventeen prostrated wretches were the people who 

brought the offering, and were offering their prayers to that 

stock.



I confess I was more moved at their stupidity and brutish worship 

of a hobgoblin than ever I was at anything in my life, and, 

overcome with rage, I rode up to the hideous idol, and with my 

sword made a stroke at the bonnet that was on its head, and cut it 

in two; and one of our men that was with me, taking hold of the 

sheepskin that covered it, pulled at it, when, behold, a most 

hideous outcry ran through the village, and two or three hundred 

people came about my ears, so that I was glad to scour for it, for 

some had bows and arrows; but I resolved from that moment to visit 

them again.  Our caravan rested three nights at the town, which was 

about four miles off, in order to provide some horses which they 

wanted, several of the horses having been lamed and jaded with the 

long march over the last desert; so we had some leisure here to put 

my design in execution.  I communicated it to the Scots merchant, 

of whose courage I had sufficient testimony; I told him what I had 

seen, and with what indignation I had since thought that human 

nature could be so degenerate; I told him if I could get but four 

or five men well armed to go with me, I was resolved to go and 

destroy that vile, abominable idol, and let them see that it had no 

power to help itself, and consequently could not be an object of 

worship, or to be prayed to, much less help them that offered 

sacrifices to it.



He at first objected to my plan as useless, seeing that, owing to 

the gross ignorance of the people, they could not be brought to 

profit by the lesson I meant to teach them; and added that, from 

his knowledge of the country and its customs, he feared we should 

fall into great peril by giving offence to these brutal idol 

worshippers.  This somewhat stayed my purpose, but I was still 

uneasy all that day to put my project in execution; and that 

evening, meeting the Scots merchant in our walk about the town, I 

again called upon him to aid me in it.  When he found me resolute 

he said that, on further thoughts, he could not but applaud the 

design, and told me I should not go alone, but he would go with me; 

but he would go first and bring a stout fellow, one of his 

countrymen, to go also with us; "and one," said he, "as famous for 

his zeal as you can desire any one to be against such devilish 

things as these."  So we agreed to go, only we three and my man-

servant, and resolved to put it in execution the following night 

about midnight, with all possible secrecy.



We thought it better to delay it till the next night, because the 

caravan being to set forward in the morning, we suppose the 

governor could not pretend to give them any satisfaction upon us 

when we were out of his power.  The Scots merchant, as steady in 

his resolution for the enterprise as bold in executing, brought me 

a Tartar's robe or gown of sheepskins, and a bonnet, with a bow and 

arrows, and had provided the same for himself and his countryman, 

that the people, if they saw us, should not determine who we were.  

All the first night we spent in mixing up some combustible matter, 

with aqua vitae, gunpowder, and such other materials as we could 

get; and having a good quantity of tar in a little pot, about an 

hour after night we set out upon our expedition.



We came to the place about eleven o'clock at night, and found that 

the people had not the least suspicion of danger attending their 

idol.  The night was cloudy:  yet the moon gave us light enough to 

see that the idol stood just in the same posture and place that it 

did before.  The people seemed to be all at their rest; only that 

in the great hut, where we saw the three priests, we saw a light, 

and going up close to the door, we heard people talking as if there 

were five or six of them; we concluded, therefore, that if we set 

wildfire to the idol, those men would come out immediately, and run 

up to the place to rescue it from destruction; and what to do with 

them we knew not.  Once we thought of carrying it away, and setting 

fire to it at a distance; but when we came to handle it, we found 

it too bulky for our carriage, so we were at a loss again.  The 

second Scotsman was for setting fire to the hut, and knocking the 

creatures that were there on the head when they came out; but I 

could not join with that; I was against killing them, if it were 

possible to avoid it.  "Well, then," said the Scots merchant, "I 

will tell you what we will do:  we will try to make them prisoners, 

tie their hands, and make them stand and see their idol destroyed."



As it happened, we had twine or packthread enough about us, which 

we used to tie our firelocks together with; so we resolved to 

attack these people first, and with as little noise as we could.  

The first thing we did, we knocked at the door, when one of the 

priests coming to it, we immediately seized upon him, stopped his 

mouth, and tied his hands behind him, and led him to the idol, 

where we gagged him that he might not make a noise, tied his feet 

also together, and left him on the ground.



Two of us then waited at the door, expecting that another would 

come out to see what the matter was; but we waited so long till the 

third man came back to us; and then nobody coming out, we knocked 

again gently, and immediately out came two more, and we served them 

just in the same manner, but were obliged to go all with them, and 

lay them down by the idol some distance from one another; when, 

going back, we found two more were come out of the door, and a 

third stood behind them within the door.  We seized the two, and 

immediately tied them, when the third, stepping back and crying 

out, my Scots merchant went in after them, and taking out a 

composition we had made that would only smoke and stink, he set 

fire to it, and threw it in among them.  By that time the other 

Scotsman and my man, taking charge of the two men already bound, 

and tied together also by the arm, led them away to the idol, and 

left them there, to see if their idol would relieve them, making 

haste back to us.



When the fuze we had thrown in had filled the hut with so much 

smoke that they were almost suffocated, we threw in a small leather 

bag of another kind, which flamed like a candle, and, following it 

in, we found there were but four people, who, as we supposed, had 

been about some of their diabolical sacrifices.  They appeared, in 

short, frightened to death, at least so as to sit trembling and 

stupid, and not able to speak either, for the smoke.



We quickly took them from the hut, where the smoke soon drove us 

out, bound them as we had done the other, and all without any 

noise.  Then we carried them all together to the idol; when we came 

there, we fell to work with him.  First, we daubed him all over, 

and his robes also, with tar, and tallow mixed with brimstone; then 

we stopped his eyes and ears and mouth full of gunpowder, and 

wrapped up a great piece of wildfire in his bonnet; then sticking 

all the combustibles we had brought with us upon him, we looked 

about to see if we could find anything else to help to burn him; 

when my Scotsman remembered that by the hut, where the men were, 

there lay a heap of dry forage; away he and the other Scotsman ran 

and fetched their arms full of that.  When we had done this, we 

took all our prisoners, and brought them, having untied their feet 

and ungagged their mouths, and made them stand up, and set them 

before their monstrous idol, and then set fire to the whole.



We stayed by it a quarter of an hour or thereabouts, till the 

powder in the eyes and mouth and ears of the idol blew up, and, as 

we could perceive, had split altogether; and in a word, till we saw 

it burned so that it would soon be quite consumed.  We then began 

to think of going away; but the Scotsman said, "No, we must not go, 

for these poor deluded wretches will all throw themselves into the 

fire, and burn themselves with the idol."  So we resolved to stay 

till the forage has burned down too, and then came away and left 

them.  After the feat was performed, we appeared in the morning 

among our fellow-travellers, exceedingly busy in getting ready for 

our journey; nor could any man suppose that we had been anywhere 

but in our beds.



But the affair did not end so; the next day came a great number of 

the country people to the town gates, and in a most outrageous 

manner demanded satisfaction of the Russian governor for the 

insulting their priests and burning their great Cham Chi-Thaungu.  

The people of Nertsinkay were at first in a great consternation, 

for they said the Tartars were already no less than thirty thousand 

strong.  The Russian governor sent out messengers to appease them, 

assuring them that he knew nothing of it, and that there had not a 

soul in his garrison been abroad, so that it could not be from 

anybody there:  but if they could let him know who did it, they 

should be exemplarily punished.  They returned haughtily, that all 

the country reverenced the great Cham Chi-Thaungu, who dwelt in the 

sun, and no mortal would have dared to offer violence to his image 

but some Christian miscreant; and they therefore resolved to 

denounce war against him and all the Russians, who, they said, were 

miscreants and Christians.



The governor, unwilling to make a breach, or to have any cause of 

war alleged to be given by him, the Czar having strictly charged 

him to treat the conquered country with gentleness, gave them all 

the good words he could.  At last he told them there was a caravan 

gone towards Russia that morning, and perhaps it was some of them 

who had done them this injury; and that if they would be satisfied 

with that, he would send after them to inquire into it.  This 

seemed to appease them a little; and accordingly the governor sent 

after us, and gave us a particular account how the thing was; 

intimating withal, that if any in our caravan had done it they 

should make their escape; but that whether we had done it or no, we 

should make all the haste forward that was possible:  and that, in 

the meantime, he would keep them in play as long as he could.



This was very friendly in the governor; however, when it came to 

the caravan, there was nobody knew anything of the matter; and as 

for us that were guilty, we were least of all suspected.  However, 

the captain of the caravan for the time took the hint that the 

governor gave us, and we travelled two days and two nights without 

any considerable stop, and then we lay at a village called Plothus:  

nor did we make any long stop here, but hastened on towards 

Jarawena, another Muscovite colony, and where we expected we should 

be safe.  But upon the second day's march from Plothus, by the 

clouds of dust behind us at a great distance, it was plain we were 

pursued.  We had entered a vast desert, and had passed by a great 

lake called Schanks Oser, when we perceived a large body of horse 

appear on the other side of the lake, to the north, we travelling 

west.  We observed they went away west, as we did, but had supposed 

we would have taken that side of the lake, whereas we very happily 

took the south side; and in two days more they disappeared again:  

for they, believing we were still before them, pushed on till they 

came to the Udda, a very great river when it passes farther north, 

but when we came to it we found it narrow and fordable.



The third day they had either found their mistake, or had 

intelligence of us, and came pouring in upon us towards dusk.  We 

had, to our great satisfaction, just pitched upon a convenient 

place for our camp; for as we had just entered upon a desert above 

five hundred miles over, where we had no towns to lodge at, and, 

indeed, expected none but the city Jarawena, which we had yet two 

days' march to; the desert, however, had some few woods in it on 

this side, and little rivers, which ran all into the great river 

Udda; it was in a narrow strait, between little but very thick 

woods, that we pitched our camp that night, expecting to be 

attacked before morning.  As it was usual for the Mogul Tartars to 

go about in troops in that desert, so the caravans always fortify 

themselves every night against them, as against armies of robbers; 

and it was, therefore, no new thing to be pursued.  But we had this 

night a most advantageous camp:  for as we lay between two woods, 

with a little rivulet running just before our front, we could not 

be surrounded, or attacked any way but in our front or rear.  We 

took care also to make our front as strong as we could, by placing 

our packs, with the camels and horses, all in a line, on the inside 

of the river, and felling some trees in our rear.



In this posture we encamped for the night; but the enemy was upon 

us before we had finished.  They did not come on like thieves, as 

we expected, but sent three messengers to us, to demand the men to 

be delivered to them that had abused their priests and burned their 

idol, that they might burn them with fire; and upon this, they 

said, they would go away, and do us no further harm, otherwise they 

would destroy us all.  Our men looked very blank at this message, 

and began to stare at one another to see who looked with the most 

guilt in their faces; but nobody was the word - nobody did it.  The 

leader of the caravan sent word he was well assured that it was not 

done by any of our camp; that we were peaceful merchants, 

travelling on our business; that we had done no harm to them or to 

any one else; and that, therefore, they must look further for the 

enemies who had injured them, for we were not the people; so they 

desired them not to disturb us, for if they did we should defend 

ourselves.



They were far from being satisfied with this for an answer:  and a 

great crowd of them came running down in the morning, by break of 

day, to our camp; but seeing us so well posted, they durst come no 

farther than the brook in our front, where they stood in such 

number as to terrify us very much; indeed, some spoke of ten 

thousand.  Here they stood and looked at us a while, and then, 

setting up a great howl, let fly a crowd of arrows among us; but we 

were well enough sheltered under our baggage, and I do not remember 

that one of us was hurt.



Some time after this we saw them move a little to our right, and 

expected them on the rear:  when a cunning fellow, a Cossack of 

Jarawena, calling to the leader of the caravan, said to him, "I 

will send all these people away to Sibeilka."  This was a city four 

or five days' journey at least to the right, and rather behind us.  

So he takes his bow and arrows, and getting on horseback, he rides 

away from our rear directly, as it were back to Nertsinskay; after 

this he takes a great circuit about, and comes directly on the army 

of the Tartars as if he had been sent express to tell them a long 

story that the people who had burned the Cham Chi-Thaungu were gone 

to Sibeilka, with a caravan of miscreants, as he called them - that 

is to say, Christians; and that they had resolved to burn the god 

Scal-Isar, belonging to the Tonguses.  As this fellow was himself a 

Tartar, and perfectly spoke their language, he counterfeited so 

well that they all believed him, and away they drove in a violent 

hurry to Sibeilka.  In less than three hours they were entirely out 

of our sight, and we never heard any more of them, nor whether they 

went to Sibeilka or no.  So we passed away safely on to Jarawena, 

where there was a Russian garrison, and there we rested five days.



From this city we had a frightful desert, which held us twenty-

three days' march.  We furnished ourselves with some tents here, 

for the better accommodating ourselves in the night; and the leader 

of the caravan procured sixteen waggons of the country, for 

carrying our water or provisions, and these carriages were our 

defence every night round our little camp; so that had the Tartars 

appeared, unless they had been very numerous indeed, they would not 

have been able to hurt us.  We may well be supposed to have wanted 

rest again after this long journey; for in this desert we neither 

saw house nor tree, and scarce a bush; though we saw abundance of 

the sable-hunters, who are all Tartars of Mogul Tartary; of which 

this country is a part; and they frequently attack small caravans, 

but we saw no numbers of them together.



After we had passed this desert we came into a country pretty well 

inhabited - that is to say, we found towns and castles, settled by 

the Czar with garrisons of stationary soldiers, to protect the 

caravans and defend the country against the Tartars, who would 

otherwise make it very dangerous travelling; and his czarish 

majesty has given such strict orders for the well guarding the 

caravans, that, if there are any Tartars heard of in the country, 

detachments of the garrison are always sent to see the travellers 

safe from station to station.  Thus the governor of Adinskoy, whom 

I had an opportunity to make a visit to, by means of the Scots 

merchant, who was acquainted with him, offered us a guard of fifty 

men, if we thought there was any danger, to the next station.



I thought, long before this, that as we came nearer to Europe we 

should find the country better inhabited, and the people more 

civilised; but I found myself mistaken in both:  for we had yet the 

nation of the Tonguses to pass through, where we saw the same 

tokens of paganism and barbarity as before; only, as they were 

conquered by the Muscovites, they were not so dangerous, but for 

rudeness of manners and idolatry no people in the world ever went 

beyond them.  They are all clothed in skins of beasts, and their 

houses are built of the same; you know not a man from a woman, 

neither by the ruggedness of their countenances nor their clothes; 

and in the winter, when the ground is covered with snow, they live 

underground in vaults, which have cavities going from one to 

another.  If the Tartars had their Cham Chi-Thaungu for a whole 

village or country, these had idols in every hut and every cave.  

This country, I reckon, was, from the desert I spoke of last, at 

least four hundred miles, half of it being another desert, which 

took us up twelve days' severe travelling, without house or tree; 

and we were obliged again to carry our own provisions, as well 

water as bread.  After we were out of this desert and had travelled 

two days, we came to Janezay, a Muscovite city or station, on the 

great river Janezay, which, they told us there, parted Europe from 

Asia.



All the country between the river Oby and the river Janezay is as 

entirely pagan, and the people as barbarous, as the remotest of the 

Tartars.  I also found, which I observed to the Muscovite governors 

whom I had an opportunity to converse with, that the poor pagans 

are not much wiser, or nearer Christianity, for being under the 

Muscovite government, which they acknowledged was true enough - but 

that, as they said, was none of their business; that if the Czar 

expected to convert his Siberian, Tonguse, or Tartar subjects, it 

should be done by sending clergymen among them, not soldiers; and 

they added, with more sincerity than I expected, that it was not so 

much the concern of their monarch to make the people Christians as 

to make them subjects.



From this river to the Oby we crossed a wild uncultivated country, 

barren of people and good management, otherwise it is in itself a 

pleasant, fruitful, and agreeable country.  What inhabitants we 

found in it are all pagans, except such as are sent among them from 

Russia; for this is the country - I mean on both sides the river 

Oby - whither the Muscovite criminals that are not put to death are 

banished, and from whence it is next to impossible they should ever 

get away.  I have nothing material to say of my particular affairs 

till I came to Tobolski, the capital city of Siberia, where I 

continued some time on the following account.



We had now been almost seven months on our journey, and winter 

began to come on apace; whereupon my partner and I called a council 

about our particular affairs, in which we found it proper, as we 

were bound for England, to consider how to dispose of ourselves.  

They told us of sledges and reindeer to carry us over the snow in 

the winter time, by which means, indeed, the Russians travel more 

in winter than they can in summer, as in these sledges they are 

able to run night and day:  the snow, being frozen, is one 

universal covering to nature, by which the hills, vales, rivers, 

and lakes are all smooth and hard is a stone, and they run upon the 

surface, without any regard to what is underneath.



But I had no occasion to urge a winter journey of this kind.  I was 

bound to England, not to Moscow, and my route lay two ways:  either 

I must go on as the caravan went, till I came to Jarislaw, and then 

go off west for Narva and the Gulf of Finland, and so on to 

Dantzic, where I might possibly sell my China cargo to good 

advantage; or I must leave the caravan at a little town on the 

Dwina, from whence I had but six days by water to Archangel, and 

from thence might be sure of shipping either to England, Holland, 

or Hamburg.



Now, to go any one of these journeys in the winter would have been 

preposterous; for as to Dantzic, the Baltic would have been frozen 

up and I could not get passage; and to go by land in those 

countries was far less safe than among the Mogul Tartars; likewise, 

as to Archangel in October, all the ships would be gone from 

thence, and even the merchants who dwell there in summer retire 

south to Moscow in the winter, when the ships are gone; so that I 

could have nothing but extremity of cold to encounter, with a 

scarcity of provisions, and must lie in an empty town all the 

winter.  Therefore, upon the whole, I thought it much my better way 

to let the caravan go, and make provision to winter where I was, at 

Tobolski, in Siberia, in the latitude of about sixty degrees, where 

I was sure of three things to wear out a cold winter with, viz. 

plenty of provisions, such as the country afforded, a warm house, 

with fuel enough, and excellent company.



I was now in quite a different climate from my beloved island, 

where I never felt cold, except when I had my ague; on the 

contrary, I had much to do to bear any clothes on my back, and 

never made any fire but without doors, which was necessary for 

dressing my food, &c.  Now I had three good vests, with large robes 

or gowns over them, to hang down to the feet, and button close to 

the wrists; and all these lined with furs, to make them 

sufficiently warm.  As to a warm house, I must confess I greatly 

dislike our way in England of making fires in every room of the 

house in open chimneys, which, when the fire is out, always keeps 

the air in the room cold as the climate.  So I took an apartment in 

a good house in the town, and ordered a chimney to be built like a 

furnace, in the centre of six several rooms, like a stove; the 

funnel to carry the smoke went up one way, the door to come at the 

fire went in another, and all the rooms were kept equally warm, but 

no fire seen, just as they heat baths in England.  By this means we 

had always the same climate in all the rooms, and an equal heat was 

preserved, and yet we saw no fire, nor were ever incommoded with 

smoke.



The most wonderful thing of all was, that it should be possible to 

meet with good company here, in a country so barbarous as this - 

one of the most northerly parts of Europe.  But this being the 

country where the state criminals of Muscovy, as I observed before, 

are all banished, the city was full of Russian noblemen, gentlemen, 

soldiers, and courtiers.  Here was the famous Prince Galitzin, the 

old German Robostiski, and several other persons of note, and some 

ladies.  By means of my Scotch merchant, whom, nevertheless, I 

parted with here, I made an acquaintance with several of these 

gentlemen; and from these, in the long winter nights in which I 

stayed here, I received several very agreeable visits.
