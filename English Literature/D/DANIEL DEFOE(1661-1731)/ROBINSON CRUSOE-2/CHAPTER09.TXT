I HAD no more business to go to the East Indies than a man at full 

liberty has to go to the turnkey at Newgate, and desire him to lock 

him up among the prisoners there, and starve him.  Had I taken a 

small vessel from England and gone directly to the island; had I 

loaded her, as I did the other vessel, with all the necessaries for 

the plantation and for my people; taken a patent from the 

government here to have secured my property, in subjection only to 

that of England; had I carried over cannon and ammunition, servants 

and people to plant, and taken possession of the place, fortified 

and strengthened it in the name of England, and increased it with 

people, as I might easily have done; had I then settled myself 

there, and sent the ship back laden with good rice, as I might also 

have done in six months' time, and ordered my friends to have 

fitted her out again for our supply - had I done this, and stayed 

there myself, I had at least acted like a man of common sense.  But 

I was possessed of a wandering spirit, and scorned all advantages:  

I pleased myself with being the patron of the people I placed 

there, and doing for them in a kind of haughty, majestic way, like 

an old patriarchal monarch, providing for them as if I had been 

father of the whole family, as well as of the plantation.  But I 

never so much as pretended to plant in the name of any government 

or nation, or to acknowledge any prince, or to call my people 

subjects to any one nation more than another; nay, I never so much 

as gave the place a name, but left it as I found it, belonging to 

nobody, and the people under no discipline or government but my 

own, who, though I had influence over them as a father and 

benefactor, had no authority or power to act or command one way or 

other, further than voluntary consent moved them to comply.  Yet 

even this, had I stayed there, would have done well enough; but as 

I rambled from them, and came there no more, the last letters I had 

from any of them were by my partner's means, who afterwards sent 

another sloop to the place, and who sent me word, though I had not 

the letter till I got to London, several years after it was 

written, that they went on but poorly; were discontented with their 

long stay there; that Will Atkins was dead; that five of the 

Spaniards were come away; and though they had not been much 

molested by the savages, yet they had had some skirmishes with 

them; and that they begged of him to write to me to think of the 

promise I had made to fetch them away, that they might see their 

country again before they died.



But I was gone a wildgoose chase indeed, and they that will have 

any more of me must be content to follow me into a new variety of 

follies, hardships, and wild adventures, wherein the justice of 

Providence may be duly observed; and we may see how easily Heaven 

can gorge us with our own desires, make the strongest of our wishes 

be our affliction, and punish us most severely with those very 

things which we think it would be our utmost happiness to be 

allowed to possess.  Whether I had business or no business, away I 

went:  it is no time now to enlarge upon the reason or absurdity of 

my own conduct, but to come to the history - I was embarked for the 

voyage, and the voyage I went.



I shall only add a word or two concerning my honest Popish 

clergyman, for let their opinion of us, and all other heretics in 

general, as they call us, be as uncharitable as it may, I verily 

believe this man was very sincere, and wished the good of all men:  

yet I believe he used reserve in many of his expressions, to 

prevent giving me offence; for I scarce heard him once call on the 

Blessed Virgin, or mention St. Jago, or his guardian angel, though 

so common with the rest of them.  However, I say I had not the 

least doubt of his sincerity and pious intentions; and I am firmly 

of opinion, if the rest of the Popish missionaries were like him, 

they would strive to visit even the poor Tartars and Laplanders, 

where they have nothing to give them, as well as covet to flock to 

India, Persia, China, &c., the most wealthy of the heathen 

countries; for if they expected to bring no gains to their Church 

by it, it may well be admired how they came to admit the Chinese 

Confucius into the calendar of the Christian saints.



A ship being ready to sail for Lisbon, my pious priest asked me 

leave to go thither; being still, as he observed, bound never to 

finish any voyage he began.  How happy it had been for me if I had 

gone with him.  But it was too late now; all things Heaven appoints 

for the best:  had I gone with him I had never had so many things 

to be thankful for, and the reader had never heard of the second 

part of the travels and adventures of Robinson Crusoe:  so I must 

here leave exclaiming at myself, and go on with my voyage.  From 

the Brazils we made directly over the Atlantic Sea to the Cape of 

Good Hope, and had a tolerably good voyage, our course generally 

south-east, now and then a storm, and some contrary winds; but my 

disasters at sea were at an end - my future rubs and cross events 

were to befall me on shore, that it might appear the land was as 

well prepared to be our scourge as the sea.



Our ship was on a trading voyage, and had a supercargo on board, 

who was to direct all her motions after she arrived at the Cape, 

only being limited to a certain number of days for stay, by 

charter-party, at the several ports she was to go to.  This was 

none of my business, neither did I meddle with it; my nephew, the 

captain, and the supercargo adjusting all those things between them 

as they thought fit.  We stayed at the Cape no longer than was 

needful to take in-fresh water, but made the best of our way for 

the coast of Coromandel.  We were, indeed, informed that a French 

man-of-war, of fifty guns, and two large merchant ships, were gone 

for the Indies; and as I knew we were at war with France, I had 

some apprehensions of them; but they went their own way, and we 

heard no more of them.



I shall not pester the reader with a tedious description of places, 

journals of our voyage, variations of the compass, latitudes, 

trade-winds, &c.; it is enough to name the ports and places which 

we touched at, and what occurred to us upon our passages from one 

to another.  We touched first at the island of Madagascar, where, 

though the people are fierce and treacherous, and very well armed 

with lances and bows, which they use with inconceivable dexterity, 

yet we fared very well with them a while.  They treated us very 

civilly; and for some trifles which we gave them, such as knives, 

scissors, &c., they brought us eleven good fat bullocks, of a 

middling size, which we took in, partly for fresh provisions for 

our present spending, and the rest to salt for the ship's use.



We were obliged to stay here some time after we had furnished 

ourselves with provisions; and I, who was always too curious to 

look into every nook of the world wherever I came, went on shore as 

often as I could.  It was on the east side of the island that we 

went on shore one evening:  and the people, who, by the way, are 

very numerous, came thronging about us, and stood gazing at us at a 

distance.  As we had traded freely with them, and had been kindly 

used, we thought ourselves in no danger; but when we saw the 

people, we cut three boughs out of a tree, and stuck them up at a 

distance from us; which, it seems, is a mark in that country not 

only of a truce and friendship, but when it is accepted the other 

side set up three poles or boughs, which is a signal that they 

accept the truce too; but then this is a known condition of the 

truce, that you are not to pass beyond their three poles towards 

them, nor they to come past your three poles or boughs towards you; 

so that you are perfectly secure within the three poles, and all 

the space between your poles and theirs is allowed like a market 

for free converse, traffic, and commerce.  When you go there you 

must not carry your weapons with you; and if they come into that 

space they stick up their javelins and lances all at the first 

poles, and come on unarmed; but if any violence is offered them, 

and the truce thereby broken, away they run to the poles, and lay 

hold of their weapons, and the truce is at an end.



It happened one evening, when we went on shore, that a greater 

number of their people came down than usual, but all very friendly 

and civil; and they brought several kinds of provisions, for which 

we satisfied them with such toys as we had; the women also brought 

us milk and roots, and several things very acceptable to us, and 

all was quiet; and we made us a little tent or hut of some boughs 

or trees, and lay on shore all night.  I know not what was the 

occasion, but I was not so well satisfied to lie on shore as the 

rest; and the boat riding at an anchor at about a stone's cast from 

the land, with two men in her to take care of her, I made one of 

them come on shore; and getting some boughs of trees to cover us 

also in the boat, I spread the sail on the bottom of the boat, and 

lay under the cover of the branches of the trees all night in the 

boat.



About two o'clock in the morning we heard one of our men making a 

terrible noise on the shore, calling out, for God's sake, to bring 

the boat in and come and help them, for they were all like to be 

murdered; and at the same time I heard the fire of five muskets, 

which was the number of guns they had, and that three times over; 

for it seems the natives here were not so easily frightened with 

guns as the savages were in America, where I had to do with them.  

All this while, I knew not what was the matter, but rousing 

immediately from sleep with the noise, I caused the boat to be 

thrust in, and resolved with three fusees we had on board to land 

and assist our men.  We got the boat soon to the shore, but our men 

were in too much haste; for being come to the shore, they plunged 

into the water, to get to the boat with all the expedition they 

could, being pursued by between three and four hundred men.  Our 

men were but nine in all, and only five of them had fusees with 

them; the rest had pistols and swords, indeed, but they were of 

small use to them.



We took up seven of our men, and with difficulty enough too, three 

of them being very ill wounded; and that which was still worse was, 

that while we stood in the boat to take our men in, we were in as 

much danger as they were in on shore; for they poured their arrows 

in upon us so thick that we were glad to barricade the side of the 

boat up with the benches, and two or three loose boards which, to 

our great satisfaction, we had by mere accident in the boat.  And 

yet, had it been daylight, they are, it seems, such exact marksmen, 

that if they could have seen but the least part of any of us, they 

would have been sure of us.  We had, by the light of the moon, a 

little sight of them, as they stood pelting us from the shore with 

darts and arrows; and having got ready our firearms, we gave them a 

volley that we could hear, by the cries of some of them, had 

wounded several; however, they stood thus in battle array on the 

shore till break of day, which we supposed was that they might see 

the better to take their aim at us.



In this condition we lay, and could not tell how to weigh our 

anchor, or set up our sail, because we must needs stand up in the 

boat, and they were as sure to hit us as we were to hit a bird in a 

tree with small shot.  We made signals of distress to the ship, and 

though she rode a league off, yet my nephew, the captain, hearing 

our firing, and by glasses perceiving the posture we lay in, and 

that we fired towards the shore, pretty well understood us; and 

weighing anchor with all speed, he stood as near the shore as he 

durst with the ship, and then sent another boat with ten hands in 

her, to assist us.  We called to them not to come too near, telling 

them what condition we were in; however, they stood in near to us, 

and one of the men taking the end of a tow-line in his hand, and 

keeping our boat between him and the enemy, so that they could not 

perfectly see him, swam on board us, and made fast the line to the 

boat:  upon which we slipped out a little cable, and leaving our 

anchor behind, they towed us out of reach of the arrows; we all the 

while lying close behind the barricade we had made.  As soon as we 

were got from between the ship and the shore, that we could lay her 

side to the shore, she ran along just by them, and poured in a 

broadside among them, loaded with pieces of iron and lead, small 

bullets, and such stuff, besides the great shot, which made a 

terrible havoc among them.



When we were got on board and out of danger, we had time to examine 

into the occasion of this fray; and indeed our supercargo, who had 

been often in those parts, put me upon it; for he said he was sure 

the inhabitants would not have touched us after we had made a 

truce, if we had not done something to provoke them to it.  At 

length it came out that an old woman, who had come to sell us some 

milk, had brought it within our poles, and a young woman with her, 

who also brought us some roots or herbs; and while the old woman 

(whether she was mother to the young woman or no they could not 

tell) was selling us the milk, one of our men offered some rudeness 

to the girl that was with her, at which the old woman made a great 

noise:  however, the seaman would not quit his prize, but carried 

her out of the old woman's sight among the trees, it being almost 

dark; the old woman went away without her, and, as we may suppose, 

made an outcry among the people she came from; who, upon notice, 

raised that great army upon us in three or four hours, and it was 

great odds but we had all been destroyed.



One of our men was killed with a lance thrown at him just at the 

beginning of the attack, as he sallied out of the tent they had 

made; the rest came off free, all but the fellow who was the 

occasion of all the mischief, who paid dear enough for his 

brutality, for we could not hear what became of him for a great 

while.  We lay upon the shore two days after, though the wind 

presented, and made signals for him, and made our boat sail up 

shore and down shore several leagues, but in vain; so we were 

obliged to give him over; and if he alone had suffered for it, the 

loss had been less.  I could not satisfy myself, however, without 

venturing on shore once more, to try if I could learn anything of 

him or them; it was the third night after the action that I had a 

great mind to learn, if I could by any means, what mischief we had 

done, and how the game stood on the Indians' side.  I was careful 

to do it in the dark, lest we should be attacked again:  but I 

ought indeed to have been sure that the men I went with had been 

under my command, before I engaged in a thing so hazardous and 

mischievous as I was brought into by it, without design.



We took twenty as stout fellows with us as any in the ship, besides 

the supercargo and myself, and we landed two hours before midnight, 

at the same place where the Indians stood drawn up in the evening 

before.  I landed here, because my design, as I have said, was 

chiefly to see if they had quitted the field, and if they had left 

any marks behind them of the mischief we had done them, and I 

thought if we could surprise one or two of them, perhaps we might 

get our man again, by way of exchange.



We landed without any noise, and divided our men into two bodies, 

whereof the boatswain commanded one and I the other.  We neither 

saw nor heard anybody stir when we landed:  and we marched up, one 

body at a distance from another, to the place.  At first we could 

see nothing, it being very dark; till by-and-by our boatswain, who 

led the first party, stumbled and fell over a dead body.  This made 

them halt a while; for knowing by the circumstances that they were 

at the place where the Indians had stood, they waited for my coming 

up there.  We concluded to halt till the moon began to rise, which 

we knew would be in less than an hour, when we could easily discern 

the havoc we had made among them.  We told thirty-two bodies upon 

the ground, whereof two were not quite dead; some had an arm and 

some a leg shot off, and one his head; those that were wounded, we 

supposed, they had carried away.  When we had made, as I thought, a 

full discovery of all we could come to the knowledge of, I resolved 

on going on board; but the boatswain and his party sent me word 

that they were resolved to make a visit to the Indian town, where 

these dogs, as they called them, dwelt, and asked me to go along 

with them; and if they could find them, as they still fancied they 

should, they did not doubt of getting a good booty; and it might be 

they might find Tom Jeffry there:  that was the man's name we had 

lost.



Had they sent to ask my leave to go, I knew well enough what answer 

to have given them; for I should have commanded them instantly on 

board, knowing it was not a hazard fit for us to run, who had a 

ship and ship-loading in our charge, and a voyage to make which 

depended very much upon the lives of the men; but as they sent me 

word they were resolved to go, and only asked me and my company to 

go along with them, I positively refused it, and rose up, for I was 

sitting on the ground, in order to go to the boat.  One or two of 

the men began to importune me to go; and when I refused, began to 

grumble, and say they were not under my command, and they would go.  

"Come, Jack," says one of the men, "will you go with me?  I'll go 

for one."  Jack said he would - and then another - and, in a word, 

they all left me but one, whom I persuaded to stay, and a boy left 

in the boat.  So the supercargo and I, with the third man, went 

back to the boat, where we told them we would stay for them, and 

take care to take in as many of them as should be left; for I told 

them it was a mad thing they were going about, and supposed most of 

them would have the fate of Tom Jeffry.



They told me, like seamen, they would warrant it they would come 

off again, and they would take care, &c.; so away they went.  I 

entreated them to consider the ship and the voyage, that their 

lives were not their own, and that they were entrusted with the 

voyage, in some measure; that if they miscarried, the ship might be 

lost for want of their help, and that they could not answer for it 

to God or man.  But I might as well have talked to the mainmast of 

the ship:  they were mad upon their journey; only they gave me good 

words, and begged I would not be angry; that they did not doubt but 

they would be back again in about an hour at furthest; for the 

Indian town, they said, was not above half-a mile off, though they 

found it above two miles before they got to it.



Well, they all went away, and though the attempt was desperate, and 

such as none but madmen would have gone about, yet, to give them 

their due, they went about it as warily as boldly; they were 

gallantly armed, for they had every man a fusee or musket, a 

bayonet, and a pistol; some of them had broad cutlasses, some of 

them had hangers, and the boatswain and two more had poleaxes; 

besides all which they had among them thirteen hand grenadoes.  

Bolder fellows, and better provided, never went about any wicked 

work in the world.  When they went out their chief design was 

plunder, and they were in mighty hopes of finding gold there; but a 

circumstance which none of them were aware of set them on fire with 

revenge, and made devils of them all.



When they came to the few Indian houses which they thought had been 

the town, which was not above half a mile off, they were under 

great disappointment, for there were not above twelve or thirteen 

houses, and where the town was, or how big, they knew not.  They 

consulted, therefore, what to do, and were some time before they 

could resolve; for if they fell upon these, they must cut all their 

throats; and it was ten to one but some of them might escape, it 

being in the night, though the moon was up; and if one escaped, he 

would run and raise all the town, so they should have a whole army 

upon them; on the other hand, if they went away and left those 

untouched, for the people were all asleep, they could not tell 

which way to look for the town; however, the last was the best 

advice, so they resolved to leave them, and look for the town as 

well as they could.  They went on a little way, and found a cow 

tied to a tree; this, they presently concluded, would be a good 

guide to them; for, they said, the cow certainly belonged to the 

town before them, or the town behind them, and if they untied her, 

they should see which way she went:  if she went back, they had 

nothing to say to her; but if she went forward, they would follow 

her.  So they cut the cord, which was made of twisted flags, and 

the cow went on before them, directly to the town; which, as they 

reported, consisted of above two hundred houses or huts, and in 

some of these they found several families living together.



Here they found all in silence, as profoundly secure as sleep could 

make them:  and first, they called another council, to consider 

what they had to do; and presently resolved to divide themselves 

into three bodies, and so set three houses on fire in three parts 

of the town; and as the men came out, to seize them and bind them 

(if any resisted, they need not be asked what to do then), and so 

to search the rest of the houses for plunder:  but they resolved to 

march silently first through the town, and see what dimensions it 

was of, and if they might venture upon it or no.



They did so, and desperately resolved that they would venture upon 

them:  but while they were animating one another to the work, three 

of them, who were a little before the rest, called out aloud to 

them, and told them that they had found - Tom Jeffry:  they all ran 

up to the place, where they found the poor fellow hanging up naked 

by one arm, and his throat cut.  There was an Indian house just by 

the tree, where they found sixteen or seventeen of the principal 

Indians, who had been concerned in the fray with us before, and two 

or three of them wounded with our shot; and our men found they were 

awake, and talking one to another in that house, but knew not their 

number.



The sight of their poor mangled comrade so enraged them, as before, 

that they swore to one another that they would be revenged, and 

that not an Indian that came into their hands should have any 

quarter; and to work they went immediately, and yet not so madly as 

might be expected from the rage and fury they were in.  Their first 

care was to get something that would soon take fire, but, after a 

little search, they found that would be to no purpose; for most of 

the houses were low, and thatched with flags and rushes, of which 

the country is full; so they presently made some wildfire, as we 

call it, by wetting a little powder in the palm of their hands, and 

in a quarter of an hour they set the town on fire in four or five 

places, and particularly that house where the Indians were not gone 

to bed.



As soon as the fire begun to blaze, the poor frightened creatures 

began to rush out to save their lives, but met with their fate in 

the attempt; and especially at the door, where they drove them 

back, the boatswain himself killing one or two with his poleaxe.  

The house being large, and many in it, he did not care to go in, 

but called for a hand grenado, and threw it among them, which at 

first frightened them, but, when it burst, made such havoc among 

them that they cried out in a hideous manner.  In short, most of 

the Indians who were in the open part of the house were killed or 

hurt with the grenado, except two or three more who pressed to the 

door, which the boatswain and two more kept, with their bayonets on 

the muzzles of their pieces, and despatched all that came in their 

way; but there was another apartment in the house, where the prince 

or king, or whatever he was, and several others were; and these 

were kept in till the house, which was by this time all in a light 

flame, fell in upon them, and they were smothered together.



All this while they fired not a gun, because they would not waken 

the people faster than they could master them; but the fire began 

to waken them fast enough, and our fellows were glad to keep a 

little together in bodies; for the fire grew so raging, all the 

houses being made of light combustible stuff, that they could 

hardly bear the street between them.  Their business was to follow 

the fire, for the surer execution:  as fast as the fire either 

forced the people out of those houses which were burning, or 

frightened them out of others, our people were ready at their doors 

to knock them on the head, still calling and hallooing one to 

another to remember Tom Jeffry.



While this was doing, I must confess I was very uneasy, and 

especially when I saw the flames of the town, which, it being 

night, seemed to be close by me.  My nephew, the captain, who was 

roused by his men seeing such a fire, was very uneasy, not knowing 

what the matter was, or what danger I was in, especially hearing 

the guns too, for by this time they began to use their firearms; a 

thousand thoughts oppressed his mind concerning me and the 

supercargo, what would become of us; and at last, though he could 

ill spare any more men, yet not knowing what exigence we might be 

in, he took another boat, and with thirteen men and himself came 

ashore to me.



He was surprised to see me and the supercargo in the boat with no 

more than two men; and though he was glad that we were well, yet he 

was in the same impatience with us to know what was doing; for the 

noise continued, and the flame increased; in short, it was next to 

an impossibility for any men in the world to restrain their 

curiosity to know what had happened, or their concern for the 

safety of the men:  in a word, the captain told me he would go and 

help his men, let what would come.  I argued with him, as I did 

before with the men, the safety of the ship, the danger of the 

voyage, the interests of the owners and merchants, &c., and told 

him I and the two men would go, and only see if we could at a 

distance learn what was likely to be the event, and come back and 

tell him.  It was in vain to talk to my nephew, as it was to talk 

to the rest before; he would go, he said; and he only wished he had 

left but ten men in the ship, for he could not think of having his 

men lost for want of help:  he had rather lose the ship, the 

voyage, and his life, and all; and away he went.



I was no more able to stay behind now than I was to persuade them 

not to go; so the captain ordered two men to row back the pinnace, 

and fetch twelve men more, leaving the long-boat at an anchor; and 

that, when they came back, six men should keep the two boats, and 

six more come after us; so that he left only sixteen men in the 

ship:  for the whole ship's company consisted of sixty-five men, 

whereof two were lost in the late quarrel which brought this 

mischief on.



Being now on the march, we felt little of the ground we trod on; 

and being guided by the fire, we kept no path, but went directly to 

the place of the flame.  If the noise of the guns was surprising to 

us before, the cries of the poor people were now quite of another 

nature, and filled us with horror.  I must confess I was never at 

the sacking a city, or at the taking a town by storm.  I had heard 

of Oliver Cromwell taking Drogheda, in Ireland, and killing man, 

woman, and child; and I had read of Count Tilly sacking the city of 

Magdeburg and cutting the throats of twenty-two thousand of all 

sexes; but I never had an idea of the thing itself before, nor is 

it possible to describe it, or the horror that was upon our minds 

at hearing it.  However, we went on, and at length came to the 

town, though there was no entering the streets of it for the fire.  

The first object we met with was the ruins of a hut or house, or 

rather the ashes of it, for the house was consumed; and just before 

it, plainly now to be seen by the light of the fire, lay four men 

and three women, killed, and, as we thought, one or two more lay in 

the heap among the fire; in short, there were such instances of 

rage, altogether barbarous, and of a fury something beyond what was 

human, that we thought it impossible our men could be guilty of it; 

or, if they were the authors of it, we thought they ought to be 

every one of them put to the worst of deaths.  But this was not 

all:  we saw the fire increase forward, and the cry went on just as 

the fire went on; so that we were in the utmost confusion.  We 

advanced a little way farther, and behold, to our astonishment, 

three naked women, and crying in a most dreadful manner, came 

flying as if they had wings, and after them sixteen or seventeen 

men, natives, in the same terror and consternation, with three of 

our English butchers in the rear, who, when they could not overtake 

them, fired in among them, and one that was killed by their shot 

fell down in our sight.  When the rest saw us, believing us to be 

their enemies, and that we would murder them as well as those that 

pursued them, they set up a most dreadful shriek, especially the 

women; and two of them fell down, as if already dead, with the 

fright.



My very soul shrunk within me, and my blood ran chill in my veins, 

when I saw this; and, I believe, had the three English sailors that 

pursued them come on, I had made our men kill them all; however, we 

took some means to let the poor flying creatures know that we would 

not hurt them; and immediately they came up to us, and kneeling 

down, with their hands lifted up, made piteous lamentation to us to 

save them, which we let them know we would:  whereupon they crept 

all together in a huddle close behind us, as for protection.  I 

left my men drawn up together, and, charging them to hurt nobody, 

but, if possible, to get at some of our people, and see what devil 

it was possessed them, and what they intended to do, and to command 

them off; assuring them that if they stayed till daylight they 

would have a hundred thousand men about their ears:  I say I left 

them, and went among those flying people, taking only two of our 

men with me; and there was, indeed, a piteous spectacle among them.  

Some of them had their feet terribly burned with trampling and 

running through the fire; others their hands burned; one of the 

women had fallen down in the fire, and was very much burned before 

she could get out again; and two or three of the men had cuts in 

their backs and thighs, from our men pursuing; and another was shot 

through the body and died while I was there.



I would fain have learned what the occasion of all this was; but I 

could not understand one word they said; though, by signs, I 

perceived some of them knew not what was the occasion themselves.  

I was so terrified in my thoughts at this outrageous attempt that I 

could not stay there, but went back to my own men, and resolved to 

go into the middle of the town, through the fire, or whatever might 

be in the way, and put an end to it, cost what it would; 

accordingly, as I came back to my men, I told them my resolution, 

and commanded them to follow me, when, at the very moment, came 

four of our men, with the boatswain at their head, roving over 

heaps of bodies they had killed, all covered with blood and dust, 

as if they wanted more people to massacre, when our men hallooed to 

them as loud as they could halloo; and with much ado one of them 

made them hear, so that they knew who we were, and came up to us.



As soon as the boatswain saw us, he set up a halloo like a shout of 

triumph, for having, as he thought, more help come; and without 

waiting to hear me, "Captain," says he, "noble captain!  I am glad 

you are come; we have not half done yet.  Villainous hell-hound 

dogs!  I'll kill as many of them as poor Tom has hairs upon his 

head:  we have sworn to spare none of them; we'll root out the very 

nation of them from the earth;" and thus he ran on, out of breath, 

too, with action, and would not give us leave to speak a word.  At 

last, raising my voice that I might silence him a little, 

"Barbarous dog!" said I, "what are you doing!  I won't have one 

creature touched more, upon pain of death; I charge you, upon your 

life, to stop your hands, and stand still here, or you are a dead 

man this minute." - "Why, sir," says he, "do you know what you do, 

or what they have done?  If you want a reason for what we have 

done, come hither;" and with that he showed me the poor fellow 

hanging, with his throat cut.



I confess I was urged then myself, and at another time would have 

been forward enough; but I thought they had carried their rage too 

far, and remembered Jacob's words to his sons Simeon and Levi:  

"Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it 

was cruel."  But I had now a new task upon my hands; for when the 

men I had carried with me saw the sight, as I had done, I had as 

much to do to restrain them as I should have had with the others; 

nay, my nephew himself fell in with them, and told me, in their 

hearing, that he was only concerned for fear of the men being 

overpowered; and as to the people, he thought not one of them ought 

to live; for they had all glutted themselves with the murder of the 

poor man, and that they ought to be used like murderers.  Upon 

these words, away ran eight of my men, with the boatswain and his 

crew, to complete their bloody work; and I, seeing it quite out of 

my power to restrain them, came away pensive and sad; for I could 

not bear the sight, much less the horrible noise and cries of the 

poor wretches that fell into their hands.



I got nobody to come back with me but the supercargo and two men, 

and with these walked back to the boat.  It was a very great piece 

of folly in me, I confess, to venture back, as it were, alone; for 

as it began now to be almost day, and the alarm had run over the 

country, there stood about forty men armed with lances and boughs 

at the little place where the twelve or thirteen houses stood, 

mentioned before:  but by accident I missed the place, and came 

directly to the seaside, and by the time I got to the seaside it 

was broad day:  immediately I took the pinnace and went on board, 

and sent her back to assist the men in what might happen.  I 

observed, about the time that I came to the boat-side, that the 

fire was pretty well out, and the noise abated; but in about half-

an-hour after I got on board, I heard a volley of our men's 

firearms, and saw a great smoke.  This, as I understood afterwards, 

was our men falling upon the men, who, as I said, stood at the few 

houses on the way, of whom they killed sixteen or seventeen, and 

set all the houses on fire, but did not meddle with the women or 

children.



By the time the men got to the shore again with the pinnace our men 

began to appear; they came dropping in, not in two bodies as they 

went, but straggling here and there in such a manner, that a small 

force of resolute men might have cut them all off.  But the dread 

of them was upon the whole country; and the men were surprised, and 

so frightened, that I believe a hundred of them would have fled at 

the sight of but five of our men.  Nor in all this terrible action 

was there a man that made any considerable defence:  they were so 

surprised between the terror of the fire and the sudden attack of 

our men in the dark, that they knew not which way to turn 

themselves; for if they fled one way they were met by one party, if 

back again by another, so that they were everywhere knocked down; 

nor did any of our men receive the least hurt, except one that 

sprained his foot, and another that had one of his hands burned.
