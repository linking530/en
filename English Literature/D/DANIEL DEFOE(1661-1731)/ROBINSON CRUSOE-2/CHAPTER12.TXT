THE inhabitants came wondering down the shore to look at us; and 

seeing the ship lie down on one side in such a manner, and heeling 

in towards the shore, and not seeing our men, who were at work on 

her bottom with stages, and with their boats on the off-side, they 

presently concluded that the ship was cast away, and lay fast on 

the ground.  On this supposition they came about us in two or three 

hours' time with ten or twelve large boats, having some of them 

eight, some ten men in a boat, intending, no doubt, to have come on 

board and plundered the ship, and if they found us there, to have 

carried us away for slaves.



When they came up to the ship, and began to row round her, they 

discovered us all hard at work on the outside of the ship's bottom 

and side, washing, and graving, and stopping, as every seafaring 

man knows how.  They stood for a while gazing at us, and we, who 

were a little surprised, could not imagine what their design was; 

but being willing to be sure, we took this opportunity to get some 

of us into the ship, and others to hand down arms and ammunition to 

those that were at work, to defend themselves with if there should 

be occasion.  And it was no more than need:  for in less than a 

quarter of an hour's consultation, they agreed, it seems, that the 

ship was really a wreck, and that we were all at work endeavouring 

to save her, or to save our lives by the help of our boats; and 

when we handed our arms into the boat, they concluded, by that act, 

that we were endeavouring to save some of our goods.  Upon this, 

they took it for granted we all belonged to them, and away they 

came directly upon our men, as if it had been in a line-of-battle.



Our men, seeing so many of them, began to be frightened, for we lay 

but in an ill posture to fight, and cried out to us to know what 

they should do.  I immediately called to the men that worked upon 

the stages to slip them down, and get up the side into the ship, 

and bade those in the boat to row round and come on board.  The few 

who were on board worked with all the strength and hands we had to 

bring the ship to rights; however, neither the men upon the stages 

nor those in the boats could do as they were ordered before the 

Cochin Chinese were upon them, when two of their boats boarded our 

longboat, and began to lay hold of the men as their prisoners.



The first man they laid hold of was an English seaman, a stout, 

strong fellow, who having a musket in his hand, never offered to 

fire it, but laid it down in the boat, like a fool, as I thought; 

but he understood his business better than I could teach him, for 

he grappled the Pagan, and dragged him by main force out of their 

boat into ours, where, taking him by the ears, he beat his head so 

against the boat's gunnel that the fellow died in his hands.  In 

the meantime, a Dutchman, who stood next, took up the musket, and 

with the butt-end of it so laid about him, that he knocked down 

five of them who attempted to enter the boat.  But this was doing 

little towards resisting thirty or forty men, who, fearless because 

ignorant of their danger, began to throw themselves into the 

longboat, where we had but five men in all to defend it; but the 

following accident, which deserved our laughter, gave our men a 

complete victory.



Our carpenter being prepared to grave the outside of the ship, as 

well as to pay the seams where he had caulked her to stop the 

leaks, had got two kettles just let down into the boat, one filled 

with boiling pitch, and the other with rosin, tallow, and oil, and 

such stuff as the shipwrights use for that work; and the man that 

attended the carpenter had a great iron ladle in his hand, with 

which he supplied the men that were at work with the hot stuff.  

Two of the enemy's men entered the boat just where this fellow 

stood in the foresheets; he immediately saluted them with a ladle 

full of the stuff, boiling hot which so burned and scalded them, 

being half-naked that they roared out like bulls, and, enraged with 

the fire, leaped both into the sea.  The carpenter saw it, and 

cried out, "Well done, Jack! give them some more of it!" and 

stepping forward himself, takes one of the mops, and dipping it in 

the pitch-pot, he and his man threw it among them so plentifully 

that, in short, of all the men in the three boats, there was not 

one that escaped being scalded in a most frightful manner, and made 

such a howling and crying that I never heard a worse noise.



I was never better pleased with a victory in my life; not only as 

it was a perfect surprise to me, and that our danger was imminent 

before, but as we got this victory without any bloodshed, except of 

that man the seaman killed with his naked hands, and which I was 

very much concerned at.  Although it maybe a just thing, because 

necessary (for there is no necessary wickedness in nature), yet I 

thought it was a sad sort of life, when we must be always obliged 

to be killing our fellow-creatures to preserve ourselves; and, 

indeed, I think so still; and I would even now suffer a great deal 

rather than I would take away the life even of the worst person 

injuring me; and I believe all considering people, who know the 

value of life, would be of my opinion, if they entered seriously 

into the consideration of it.



All the while this was doing, my partner and I, who managed the 

rest of the men on board, had with great dexterity brought the ship 

almost to rights, and having got the guns into their places again, 

the gunner called to me to bid our boat get out of the way, for he 

would let fly among them.  I called back again to him, and bid him 

not offer to fire, for the carpenter would do the work without him; 

but bid him heat another pitch-kettle, which our cook, who was on 

broad, took care of.  However, the enemy was so terrified with what 

they had met with in their first attack, that they would not come 

on again; and some of them who were farthest off, seeing the ship 

swim, as it were, upright, began, as we suppose, to see their 

mistake, and gave over the enterprise, finding it was not as they 

expected.  Thus we got clear of this merry fight; and having got 

some rice and some roots and bread, with about sixteen hogs, on 

board two days before, we resolved to stay here no longer, but go 

forward, whatever came of it; for we made no doubt but we should be 

surrounded the next day with rogues enough, perhaps more than our 

pitch-kettle would dispose of for us.  We therefore got all our 

things on board the same evening, and the next morning were ready 

to sail:  in the meantime, lying at anchor at some distance from 

the shore, we were not so much concerned, being now in a fighting 

posture, as well as in a sailing posture, if any enemy had 

presented.  The next day, having finished our work within board, 

and finding our ship was perfectly healed of all her leaks, we set 

sail.  We would have gone into the bay of Tonquin, for we wanted to 

inform ourselves of what was to be known concerning the Dutch ships 

that had been there; but we durst not stand in there, because we 

had seen several ships go in, as we supposed, but a little before; 

so we kept on NE. towards the island of Formosa, as much afraid of 

being seen by a Dutch or English merchant ship as a Dutch or 

English merchant ship in the Mediterranean is of an Algerine man-

of-war.



When we were thus got to sea, we kept on NE., as if we would go to 

the Manillas or the Philippine Islands; and this we did that we 

might not fall into the way of any of the European ships; and then 

we steered north, till we came to the latitude of 22 degrees 30 

seconds, by which means we made the island of Formosa directly, 

where we came to an anchor, in order to get water and fresh 

provisions, which the people there, who are very courteous in their 

manners, supplied us with willingly, and dealt very fairly and 

punctually with us in all their agreements and bargains.  This is 

what we did not find among other people, and may be owing to the 

remains of Christianity which was once planted here by a Dutch 

missionary of Protestants, and it is a testimony of what I have 

often observed, viz. that the Christian religion always civilises 

the people, and reforms their manners, where it is received, 

whether it works saving effects upon them or no.



From thence we sailed still north, keeping the coast of China at an 

equal distance, till we knew we were beyond all the ports of China 

where our European ships usually come; being resolved, if possible, 

not to fall into any of their hands, especially in this country, 

where, as our circumstances were, we could not fail of being 

entirely ruined.  Being now come to the latitude of 30 degrees, we 

resolved to put into the first trading port we should come at; and 

standing in for the shore, a boat came of two leagues to us with an 

old Portuguese pilot on board, who, knowing us to be an European 

ship, came to offer his service, which, indeed, we were glad of and 

took him on board; upon which, without asking us whither we would 

go, he dismissed the boat he came in, and sent it back.  I thought 

it was now so much in our choice to make the old man carry us 

whither we would, that I began to talk to him about carrying us to 

the Gulf of Nankin, which is the most northern part of the coast of 

China.  The old man said he knew the Gulf of Nankin very well; but 

smiling, asked us what we would do there?  I told him we would sell 

our cargo and purchase China wares, calicoes, raw silks, tea, 

wrought silks, &c.; and so we would return by the same course we 

came.  He told us our best port would have been to put in at Macao, 

where we could not have failed of a market for our opium to our 

satisfaction, and might for our money have purchased all sorts of 

China goods as cheap as we could at Nankin.



Not being able to put the old man out of his talk, of which he was 

very opinionated or conceited, I told him we were gentlemen as well 

as merchants, and that we had a mind to go and see the great city 

of Pekin, and the famous court of the monarch of China.  "Why, 

then," says the old man, "you should go to Ningpo, where, by the 

river which runs into the sea there, you may go up within five 

leagues of the great canal.  This canal is a navigable stream, 

which goes through the heart of that vast empire of China, crosses 

all the rivers, passes some considerable hills by the help of 

sluices and gates, and goes up to the city of Pekin, being in 

length near two hundred and seventy leagues." - "Well," said I, 

"Seignior Portuguese, but that is not our business now; the great 

question is, if you can carry us up to the city of Nankin, from 

whence we can travel to Pekin afterwards?"  He said he could do so 

very well, and that there was a great Dutch ship gone up that way 

just before.  This gave me a little shock, for a Dutch ship was now 

our terror, and we had much rather have met the devil, at least if 

he had not come in too frightful a figure; and we depended upon it 

that a Dutch ship would be our destruction, for we were in no 

condition to fight them; all the ships they trade with into those 

parts being of great burden, and of much greater force than we 

were.



The old man found me a little confused, and under some concern when 

he named a Dutch ship, and said to me, "Sir, you need be under no 

apprehensions of the Dutch; I suppose they are not now at war with 

your nation?" - "No," said I, "that's true; but I know not what 

liberties men may take when they are out of the reach of the laws 

of their own country." - "Why," says he, "you are no pirates; what 

need you fear?  They will not meddle with peaceable merchants, 

sure."  These words put me into the greatest disorder and confusion 

imaginable; nor was it possible for me to conceal it so, but the 

old man easily perceived it.



"Sir," says he, "I find you are in some disorder in your thoughts 

at my talk:  pray be pleased to go which way you think fit, and 

depend upon it, I'll do you all the service I can."  Upon this we 

fell into further discourse, in which, to my alarm and amazement, 

he spoke of the villainous doings of a certain pirate ship that had 

long been the talk of mariners in those seas; no other, in a word, 

than the very ship he was now on board of, and which we had so 

unluckily purchased.  I presently saw there was no help for it but 

to tell him the plain truth, and explain all the danger and trouble 

we had suffered through this misadventure, and, in particular, our 

earnest wish to be speedily quit of the ship altogether; for which 

reason we had resolved to carry her up to Nankin.



The old man was amazed at this relation, and told us we were in the 

right to go away to the north; and that, if he might advise us, it 

should be to sell the ship in China, which we might well do, and 

buy, or build another in the country; adding that I should meet 

with customers enough for the ship at Nankin, that a Chinese junk 

would serve me very well to go back again, and that he would 

procure me people both to buy one and sell the other.  "Well, but, 

seignior," said I, "as you say they know the ship so well, I may, 

perhaps, if I follow your measures, be instrumental to bring some 

honest, innocent men into a terrible broil; for wherever they find 

the ship they will prove the guilt upon the men, by proving this 

was the ship." - "Why," says the old man, "I'll find out a way to 

prevent that; for as I know all those commanders you speak of very 

well, and shall see them all as they pass by, I will be sure to set 

them to rights in the thing, and let them know that they had been 

so much in the wrong; that though the people who were on board at 

first might run away with the ship, yet it was not true that they 

had turned pirates; and that, in particular, these were not the men 

that first went off with the ship, but innocently bought her for 

their trade; and I am persuaded they will so far believe me as at 

least to act more cautiously for the time to come."



In about thirteen days' sail we came to an anchor, at the south-

west point of the great Gulf of Nankin; where I learned by accident 

that two Dutch ships were gone the length before me, and that I 

should certainly fall into their hands.  I consulted my partner 

again in this exigency, and he was as much at a loss as I was.  I 

then asked the old pilot if there was no creek or harbour which I 

might put into and pursue my business with the Chinese privately, 

and be in no danger of the enemy.  He told me if I would sail to 

the southward about forty-two leagues, there was a little port 

called Quinchang, where the fathers of the mission usually landed 

from Macao, on their progress to teach the Christian religion to 

the Chinese, and where no European ships ever put in; and if I 

thought to put in there, I might consider what further course to 

take when I was on shore.  He confessed, he said, it was not a 

place for merchants, except that at some certain times they had a 

kind of a fair there, when the merchants from Japan came over 

thither to buy Chinese merchandises.  The name of the port I may 

perhaps spell wrong, having lost this, together with the names of 

many other places set down in a little pocket-book, which was 

spoiled by the water by an accident; but this I remember, that the 

Chinese merchants we corresponded with called it by a different 

name from that which our Portuguese pilot gave it, who pronounced 

it Quinchang.  As we were unanimous in our resolution to go to this 

place, we weighed the next day, having only gone twice on shore 

where we were, to get fresh water; on both which occasions the 

people of the country were very civil, and brought abundance of 

provisions to sell to us; but nothing without money.



We did not come to the other port (the wind being contrary) for 

five days; but it was very much to our satisfaction, and I was 

thankful when I set my foot on shore, resolving, and my partner 

too, that if it was possible to dispose of ourselves and effects 

any other way, though not profitably, we would never more set foot 

on board that unhappy vessel.  Indeed, I must acknowledge, that of 

all the circumstances of life that ever I had any experience of, 

nothing makes mankind so completely miserable as that of being in 

constant fear.  Well does the Scripture say, "The fear of man 

brings a snare"; it is a life of death, and the mind is so entirely 

oppressed by it, that it is capable of no relief.



Nor did it fail of its usual operations upon the fancy, by 

heightening every danger; representing the English and Dutch 

captains to be men incapable of hearing reason, or of 

distinguishing between honest men and rogues; or between a story 

calculated for our own turn, made out of nothing, on purpose to 

deceive, and a true, genuine account of our whole voyage, progress, 

and design; for we might many ways have convinced any reasonable 

creatures that we were not pirates; the goods we had on board, the 

course we steered, our frankly showing ourselves, and entering into 

such and such ports; and even our very manner, the force we had, 

the number of men, the few arms, the little ammunition, short 

provisions; all these would have served to convince any men that we 

were no pirates.  The opium and other goods we had on board would 

make it appear the ship had been at Bengal.  The Dutchmen, who, it 

was said, had the names of all the men that were in the ship, might 

easily see that we were a mixture of English, Portuguese, and 

Indians, and but two Dutchmen on board.  These, and many other 

particular circumstances, might have made it evident to the 

understanding of any commander, whose hands we might fall into, 

that we were no pirates.



But fear, that blind, useless passion, worked another way, and 

threw us into the vapours; it bewildered our understandings, and 

set the imagination at work to form a thousand terrible things that 

perhaps might never happen.  We first supposed, as indeed everybody 

had related to us, that the seamen on board the English and Dutch 

ships, but especially the Dutch, were so enraged at the name of a 

pirate, and especially at our beating off their boats and escaping, 

that they would not give themselves leave to inquire whether we 

were pirates or no, but would execute us off-hand, without giving 

us any room for a defence.  We reflected that there really was so 

much apparent evidence before them, that they would scarce inquire 

after any more; as, first, that the ship was certainly the same, 

and that some of the seamen among them knew her, and had been on 

board her; and, secondly, that when we had intelligence at the 

river of Cambodia that they were coming down to examine us, we 

fought their boats and fled.  Therefore we made no doubt but they 

were as fully satisfied of our being pirates as we were satisfied 

of the contrary; and, as I often said, I know not but I should have 

been apt to have taken those circumstances for evidence, if the 

tables were turned, and my case was theirs; and have made no 

scruple of cutting all the crew to pieces, without believing, or 

perhaps considering, what they might have to offer in their 

defence.



But let that be how it will, these were our apprehensions; and both 

my partner and I scarce slept a night without dreaming of halters 

and yard-arms; of fighting, and being taken; of killing, and being 

killed:  and one night I was in such a fury in my dream, fancying 

the Dutchmen had boarded us, and I was knocking one of their seamen 

down, that I struck my doubled fist against the side of the cabin I 

lay in with such a force as wounded my hand grievously, broke my 

knuckles, and cut and bruised the flesh, so that it awaked me out 

of my sleep.  Another apprehension I had was, the cruel usage we 

might meet with from them if we fell into their hands; then the 

story of Amboyna came into my head, and how the Dutch might perhaps 

torture us, as they did our countrymen there, and make some of our 

men, by extremity of torture, confess to crimes they never were 

guilty of, or own themselves and all of us to be pirates, and so 

they would put us to death with a formal appearance of justice; and 

that they might be tempted to do this for the gain of our ship and 

cargo, worth altogether four or five thousand pounds.  We did not 

consider that the captains of ships have no authority to act thus; 

and if we had surrendered prisoners to them, they could not answer 

the destroying us, or torturing us, but would be accountable for it 

when they came to their country.  However, if they were to act thus 

with us, what advantage would it be to us that they should be 

called to an account for it? - or if we were first to be murdered, 

what satisfaction would it be to us to have them punished when they 

came home?



I cannot refrain taking notice here what reflections I now had upon 

the vast variety of my particular circumstances; how hard I thought 

it that I, who had spent forty years in a life of continual 

difficulties, and was at last come, as it were, to the port or 

haven which all men drive at, viz. to have rest and plenty, should 

be a volunteer in new sorrows by my own unhappy choice, and that I, 

who had escaped so many dangers in my youth, should now come to be 

hanged in my old age, and in so remote a place, for a crime which I 

was not in the least inclined to, much less guilty of.  After these 

thoughts something of religion would come in; and I would be 

considering that this seemed to me to be a disposition of immediate 

Providence, and I ought to look upon it and submit to it as such.  

For, although I was innocent as to men, I was far from being 

innocent as to my Maker; and I ought to look in and examine what 

other crimes in my life were most obvious to me, and for which 

Providence might justly inflict this punishment as a retribution; 

and thus I ought to submit to this, just as I would to a shipwreck, 

if it had pleased God to have brought such a disaster upon me.



In its turn natural courage would sometimes take its place, and 

then I would be talking myself up to vigorous resolutions; that I 

would not be taken to be barbarously used by a parcel of merciless 

wretches in cold blood; that it were much better to have fallen 

into the hands of the savages, though I were sure they would feast 

upon me when they had taken me, than those who would perhaps glut 

their rage upon me by inhuman tortures and barbarities; that in the 

case of the savages, I always resolved to die fighting to the last 

gasp, and why should I not do so now?  Whenever these thoughts 

prevailed, I was sure to put myself into a kind of fever with the 

agitation of a supposed fight; my blood would boil, and my eyes 

sparkle, as if I was engaged, and I always resolved to take no 

quarter at their hands; but even at last, if I could resist no 

longer, I would blow up the ship and all that was in her, and leave 

them but little booty to boast of.
