IT was talking one night with a certain prince, one of the banished 

ministers of state belonging to the Czar, that the discourse of my 

particular case began.  He had been telling me abundance of fine 

things of the greatness, the magnificence, the dominions, and the 

absolute power of the Emperor of the Russians:  I interrupted him, 

and told him I was a greater and more powerful prince than ever the 

Czar was, though my dominion were not so large, or my people so 

many.  The Russian grandee looked a little surprised, and, fixing 

his eyes steadily upon me, began to wonder what I meant.  I said 

his wonder would cease when I had explained myself, and told him 

the story at large of my living in the island; and then how I 

managed both myself and the people that were under me, just as I 

have since minuted it down.  They were exceedingly taken with the 

story, and especially the prince, who told me, with a sigh, that 

the true greatness of life was to be masters of ourselves; that he 

would not have exchanged such a state of life as mine to be Czar of 

Muscovy; and that he found more felicity in the retirement he 

seemed to be banished to there, than ever he found in the highest 

authority he enjoyed in the court of his master the Czar; that the 

height of human wisdom was to bring our tempers down to our 

circumstances, and to make a calm within, under the weight of the 

greatest storms without.  When he came first hither, he said, he 

used to tear the hair from his head, and the clothes from his back, 

as others had done before him; but a little time and consideration 

had made him look into himself, as well as round him to things 

without; that he found the mind of man, if it was but once brought 

to reflect upon the state of universal life, and how little this 

world was concerned in its true felicity, was perfectly capable of 

making a felicity for itself, fully satisfying to itself, and 

suitable to its own best ends and desires, with but very little 

assistance from the world.  That being now deprived of all the 

fancied felicity which he enjoyed in the full exercise of worldly 

pleasures, he said he was at leisure to look upon the dark side of 

them, where he found all manner of deformity; and was now convinced 

that virtue only makes a man truly wise, rich, and great, and 

preserves him in the way to a superior happiness in a future state; 

and in this, he said, they were more happy in their banishment than 

all their enemies were, who had the full possession of all the 

wealth and power they had left behind them.  "Nor, sir," says he, 

"do I bring my mind to this politically, from the necessity of my 

circumstances, which some call miserable; but, if I know anything 

of myself, I would not now go back, though the Czar my master 

should call me, and reinstate me in all my former grandeur."



He spoke this with so much warmth in his temper, so much 

earnestness and motion of his spirits, that it was evident it was 

the true sense of his soul; there was no room to doubt his 

sincerity.  I told him I once thought myself a kind of monarch in 

my old station, of which I had given him an account; but that I 

thought he was not only a monarch, but a great conqueror; for he 

that had got a victory over his own exorbitant desires, and the 

absolute dominion over himself, he whose reason entirely governs 

his will, is certainly greater than he that conquers a city.



I had been here eight months, and a dark, dreadful winter I thought 

it; the cold so intense that I could not so much as look abroad 

without being wrapped in furs, and a kind of mask of fur before my 

face, with only a hole for breath, and two for sight:  the little 

daylight we had was for three months not above five hours a day, 

and six at most; only that the snow lying on the ground 

continually, and the weather being clear, it was never quite dark.  

Our horses were kept, or rather starved, underground; and as for 

our servants, whom we hired here to look after ourselves and 

horses, we had, every now and then, their fingers and toes to thaw 

and take care of, lest they should mortify and fall off.



It is true, within doors we were warm, the houses being close, the 

walls thick, the windows small, and the glass all double.  Our food 

was chiefly the flesh of deer, dried and cured in the season; bread 

good enough, but baked as biscuits; dried fish of several sorts, 

and some flesh of mutton, and of buffaloes, which is pretty good 

meat.  All the stores of provisions for the winter are laid up in 

the summer, and well cured:  our drink was water, mixed with aqua 

vitae instead of brandy; and for a treat, mead instead of wine, 

which, however, they have very good.  The hunters, who venture 

abroad all weathers, frequently brought us in fine venison, and 

sometimes bear's flesh, but we did not much care for the last.  We 

had a good stock of tea, with which we treated our friends, and we 

lived cheerfully and well, all things considered.



It was now March, the days grown considerably longer, and the 

weather at least tolerable; so the other travellers began to 

prepare sledges to carry them over the snow, and to get things 

ready to be going; but my measures being fixed, as I have said, for 

Archangel, and not for Muscovy or the Baltic, I made no motion; 

knowing very well that the ships from the south do not set out for 

that part of the world till May or June, and that if I was there by 

the beginning of August, it would be as soon as any ships would be 

ready to sail.  Therefore I made no haste to be gone, as others 

did:  in a word, I saw a great many people, nay, all the 

travellers, go away before me.  It seems every year they go from 

thence to Muscovy, for trade, to carry furs, and buy necessaries, 

which they bring back with them to furnish their shops:  also 

others went on the same errand to Archangel.



In the month of May I began to make all ready to pack up; and, as I 

was doing this, it occurred to me that, seeing all these people 

were banished by the Czar to Siberia, and yet, when they came 

there, were left at liberty to go whither they would, why they did 

not then go away to any part of the world, wherever they thought 

fit:  and I began to examine what should hinder them from making 

such an attempt.  But my wonder was over when I entered upon that 

subject with the person I have mentioned, who answered me thus:  

"Consider, first, sir," said he, "the place where we are; and, 

secondly, the condition we are in; especially the generality of the 

people who are banished thither.  We are surrounded with stronger 

things than bars or bolts; on the north side, an unnavigable ocean, 

where ship never sailed, and boat never swam; every other way we 

have above a thousand miles to pass through the Czar's own 

dominion, and by ways utterly impassable, except by the roads made 

by the government, and through the towns garrisoned by his troops; 

in short, we could neither pass undiscovered by the road, nor 

subsist any other way, so that it is in vain to attempt it."



I was silenced at once, and found that they were in a prison every 

jot as secure as if they had been locked up in the castle at 

Moscow:  however, it came into my thoughts that I might certainly 

be made an instrument to procure the escape of this excellent 

person; and that, whatever hazard I ran, I would certainly try if I 

could carry him off.  Upon this, I took an occasion one evening to 

tell him my thoughts.  I represented to him that it was very easy 

for me to carry him away, there being no guard over him in the 

country; and as I was not going to Moscow, but to Archangel, and 

that I went in the retinue of a caravan, by which I was not obliged 

to lie in the stationary towns in the desert, but could encamp 

every night where I would, we might easily pass uninterrupted to 

Archangel, where I would immediately secure him on board an English 

ship, and carry him safe along with me; and as to his subsistence 

and other particulars, it should be my care till he could better 

supply himself.



He heard me very attentively, and looked earnestly on me all the 

while I spoke; nay, I could see in his very face that what I said 

put his spirits into an exceeding ferment; his colour frequently 

changed, his eyes looked red, and his heart fluttered, till it 

might be even perceived in his countenance; nor could he 

immediately answer me when I had done, and, as it were, hesitated 

what he would say to it; but after he had paused a little, he 

embraced me, and said, "How unhappy are we, unguarded creatures as 

we are, that even our greatest acts of friendship are made snares 

unto us, and we are made tempters of one another!"  He then 

heartily thanked me for my offers of service, but withstood 

resolutely the arguments I used to urge him to set himself free.  

He declared, in earnest terms, that he was fully bent on remaining 

where he was rather than seek to return to his former miserable 

greatness, as he called it:  where the seeds of pride, ambition, 

avarice, and luxury might revive, take root, and again overwhelm 

him.  "Let me remain, dear sir," he said, in conclusion - "let me 

remain in this blessed confinement, banished from the crimes of 

life, rather than purchase a show of freedom at the expense of the 

liberty of my reason, and at the future happiness which I now have 

in my view, but should then, I fear, quickly lose sight of; for I 

am but flesh; a man, a mere man; and have passions and affections 

as likely to possess and overthrow me as any man:  Oh, be not my 

friend and tempter both together!"



If I was surprised before, I was quite dumb now, and stood silent, 

looking at him, and, indeed, admiring what I saw.  The struggle in 

his soul was so great that, though the weather was extremely cold, 

it put him into a most violent heat; so I said a word or two, that 

I would leave him to consider of it, and wait on him again, and 

then I withdrew to my own apartment.



About two hours after I heard somebody at or near the door of my 

room, and I was going to open the door, but he had opened it and 

come in.  "My dear friend," says he, "you had almost overset me, 

but I am recovered.  Do not take it ill that I do not close with 

your offer.  I assure you it is not for want of sense of the 

kindness of it in you; and I came to make the most sincere 

acknowledgment of it to you; but I hope I have got the victory over 

myself." - "My lord," said I, "I hope you are fully satisfied that 

you do not resist the call of Heaven." - "Sir," said he, "if it had 

been from Heaven, the same power would have influenced me to have 

accepted it; but I hope, and am fully satisfied, that it is from 

Heaven that I decline it, and I have infinite satisfaction in the 

parting, that you shall leave me an honest man still, though not a 

free man."



I had nothing to do but to acquiesce, and make professions to him 

of my having no end in it but a sincere desire to serve him.  He 

embraced me very passionately, and assured me he was sensible of 

that, and should always acknowledge it; and with that he offered me 

a very fine present of sables - too much, indeed, for me to accept 

from a man in his circumstances, and I would have avoided them, but 

he would not be refused.  The next morning I sent my servant to his 

lordship with a small present of tea, and two pieces of China 

damask, and four little wedges of Japan gold, which did not all 

weigh above six ounces or thereabouts, but were far short of the 

value of his sables, which, when I came to England, I found worth 

near two hundred pounds.  He accepted the tea, and one piece of the 

damask, and one of the pieces of gold, which had a fine stamp upon 

it, of the Japan coinage, which I found he took for the rarity of 

it, but would not take any more:  and he sent word by my servant 

that he desired to speak with me.



When I came to him he told me I knew what had passed between us, 

and hoped I would not move him any more in that affair; but that, 

since I had made such a generous offer to him, he asked me if I had 

kindness enough to offer the same to another person that he would 

name to me, in whom he had a great share of concern.  In a word, he 

told me it was his only son; who, though I had not seen him, was in 

the same condition with himself, and above two hundred miles from 

him, on the other side of the Oby; but that, if I consented, he 

would send for him.



I made no hesitation, but told him I would do it.  I made some 

ceremony in letting him understand that it was wholly on his 

account; and that, seeing I could not prevail on him, I would show 

my respect to him by my concern for his son.  He sent the next day 

for his son; and in about twenty days he came back with the 

messenger, bringing six or seven horses, loaded with very rich 

furs, which, in the whole, amounted to a very great value.  His 

servants brought the horses into the town, but left the young lord 

at a distance till night, when he came incognito into our 

apartment, and his father presented him to me; and, in short, we 

concerted the manner of our travelling, and everything proper for 

the journey.



I had bought a considerable quantity of sables, black fox-skins, 

fine ermines, and such other furs as are very rich in that city, in 

exchange for some of the goods I had brought from China; in 

particular for the cloves and nutmegs, of which I sold the greatest 

part here, and the rest afterwards at Archangel, for a much better 

price than I could have got at London; and my partner, who was 

sensible of the profit, and whose business, more particularly than 

mine, was merchandise, was mightily pleased with our stay, on 

account of the traffic we made here.



It was the beginning of June when I left this remote place.  We 

were now reduced to a very small caravan, having only thirty-two 

horses and camels in all, which passed for mine, though my new 

guest was proprietor of eleven of them.  It was natural also that I 

should take more servants with me than I had before; and the young 

lord passed for my steward; what great man I passed for myself I 

know not, neither did it concern me to inquire.  We had here the 

worst and the largest desert to pass over that we met with in our 

whole journey; I call it the worst, because the way was very deep 

in some places, and very uneven in others; the best we had to say 

for it was, that we thought we had no troops of Tartars or robbers 

to fear, as they never came on this side of the river Oby, or at 

least very seldom; but we found it otherwise.



My young lord had a faithful Siberian servant, who was perfectly 

acquainted with the country, and led us by private roads, so that 

we avoided coming into the principal towns and cities upon the 

great road, such as Tumen, Soloy Kamaskoy, and several others; 

because the Muscovite garrisons which are kept there are very 

curious and strict in their observation upon travellers, and 

searching lest any of the banished persons of note should make 

their escape that way into Muscovy; but, by this means, as we were 

kept out of the cities, so our whole journey was a desert, and we 

were obliged to encamp and lie in our tents, when we might have had 

very good accommodation in the cities on the way; this the young 

lord was so sensible of, that he would not allow us to lie abroad 

when we came to several cities on the way, but lay abroad himself, 

with his servant, in the woods, and met us always at the appointed 

places.



We had just entered Europe, having passed the river Kama, which in 

these parts is the boundary between Europe and Asia, and the first 

city on the European side was called Soloy Kamaskoy, that is, the 

great city on the river Kama.  And here we thought to see some 

evident alteration in the people; but we were mistaken, for as we 

had a vast desert to pass, which is near seven hundred miles long 

in some places, but not above two hundred miles over where we 

passed it, so, till we came past that horrible place, we found very 

little difference between that country and Mogul Tartary.  The 

people are mostly pagans; their houses and towns full of idols; and 

their way of living wholly barbarous, except in the cities and 

villages near them, where they are Christians, as they call 

themselves, of the Greek Church:  but have their religion mingled 

with so many relics of superstition, that it is scarce to be known 

in some places from mere sorcery and witchcraft.



In passing this forest (after all our dangers were, to our 

imagination, escaped), I thought, indeed, we must have been 

plundered and robbed, and perhaps murdered, by a troop of thieves:  

of what country they were I am yet at a loss to know; but they were 

all on horseback, carried bows and arrows, and were at first about 

forty-five in number.  They came so near to us as to be within two 

musket-shot, and, asking no questions, surrounded us with their 

horses, and looked very earnestly upon us twice; at length, they 

placed themselves just in our way; upon which we drew up in a 

little line, before our camels, being not above sixteen men in all.  

Thus drawn up, we halted, and sent out the Siberian servant, who 

attended his lord, to see who they were; his master was the more 

willing to let him go, because he was not a little apprehensive 

that they were a Siberian troop sent out after him.  The man came 

up near them with a flag of truce, and called to them; but though 

he spoke several of their languages, or dialects of languages 

rather, he could not understand a word they said; however, after 

some signs to him not to come near them at his peril, the fellow 

came back no wiser than he went; only that by their dress, he said, 

he believed them to be some Tartars of Kalmuck, or of the 

Circassian hordes, and that there must be more of them upon the 

great desert, though he never heard that any of them were seen so 

far north before.



This was small comfort to us; however, we had no remedy:  there was 

on our left hand, at about a quarter of a mile distance, a little 

grove, and very near the road.  I immediately resolved we should 

advance to those trees, and fortify ourselves as well as we could 

there; for, first, I considered that the trees would in a great 

measure cover us from their arrows; and, in the next place, they 

could not come to charge us in a body:  it was, indeed, my old 

Portuguese pilot who proposed it, and who had this excellency 

attending him, that he was always readiest and most apt to direct 

and encourage us in cases of the most danger.  We advanced 

immediately, with what speed we could, and gained that little wood; 

the Tartars, or thieves, for we knew not what to call them, keeping 

their stand, and not attempting to hinder us.  When we came 

thither, we found, to our great satisfaction, that it was a swampy 

piece of ground, and on the one side a very great spring of water, 

which, running out in a little brook, was a little farther joined 

by another of the like size; and was, in short, the source of a 

considerable river, called afterwards the Wirtska; the trees which 

grew about this spring were not above two hundred, but very large, 

and stood pretty thick, so that as soon as we got in, we saw 

ourselves perfectly safe from the enemy unless they attacked us on 

foot.



While we stayed here waiting the motion of the enemy some hours, 

without perceiving that they made any movement, our Portuguese, 

with some help, cut several arms of trees half off, and laid them 

hanging across from one tree to another, and in a manner fenced us 

in.  About two hours before night they came down directly upon us; 

and though we had not perceived it, we found they had been joined 

by some more, so that they were near fourscore horse; whereof, 

however, we fancied some were women.  They came on till they were 

within half-shot of our little wood, when we fired one musket 

without ball, and called to them in the Russian tongue to know what 

they wanted, and bade them keep off; but they came on with a double 

fury up to the wood-side, not imagining we were so barricaded that 

they could not easily break in.  Our old pilot was our captain as 

well as our engineer, and desired us not to fire upon them till 

they came within pistol-shot, that we might be sure to kill, and 

that when we did fire we should be sure to take good aim; we bade 

him give the word of command, which he delayed so long that they 

were some of them within two pikes' length of us when we let fly.  

We aimed so true that we killed fourteen of them, and wounded 

several others, as also several of their horses; for we had all of 

us loaded our pieces with two or three bullets apiece at least.



They were terribly surprised with our fire, and retreated 

immediately about one hundred rods from us; in which time we loaded 

our pieces again, and seeing them keep that distance, we sallied 

out, and caught four or five of their horses, whose riders we 

supposed were killed; and coming up to the dead, we judged they 

were Tartars, but knew not how they came to make an excursion such 

an unusual length.



About an hour after they again made a motion to attack us, and rode 

round our little wood to see where they might break in; but finding 

us always ready to face them, they went off again; and we resolved 

not to stir for that night.



We slept little, but spent the most part of the night in 

strengthening our situation, and barricading the entrances into the 

wood, and keeping a strict watch.  We waited for daylight, and when 

it came, it gave us a very unwelcome discovery indeed; for the 

enemy, who we thought were discouraged with the reception they met 

with, were now greatly increased, and had set up eleven or twelve 

huts or tents, as if they were resolved to besiege us; and this 

little camp they had pitched upon the open plain, about three-

quarters of a mile from us.  I confess I now gave myself over for 

lost, and all that I had; the loss of my effects did not lie so 

near me, though very considerable, as the thoughts of falling into 

the hands of such barbarians at the latter end of my journey, after 

so many difficulties and hazards as I had gone through, and even in 

sight of our port, where we expected safety and deliverance.  As to 

my partner, he was raging, and declared that to lose his goods 

would be his ruin, and that he would rather die than be starved, 

and he was for fighting to the last drop.



The young lord, a most gallant youth, was for fighting to the last 

also; and my old pilot was of opinion that we were able to resist 

them all in the situation we were then in.  Thus we spent the day 

in debates of what we should do; but towards evening we found that 

the number of our enemies still increased, and we did not know but 

by the morning they might still be a greater number:  so I began to 

inquire of those people we had brought from Tobolski if there were 

no private ways by which we might avoid them in the night, and 

perhaps retreat to some town, or get help to guard us over the 

desert.  The young lord's Siberian servant told us, if we designed 

to avoid them, and not fight, he would engage to carry us off in 

the night, to a way that went north, towards the river Petruz, by 

which he made no question but we might get away, and the Tartars 

never discover it; but, he said, his lord had told him he would not 

retreat, but would rather choose to fight.  I told him he mistook 

his lord:  for that he was too wise a man to love fighting for the 

sake of it; that I knew he was brave enough by what he had showed 

already; but that he knew better than to desire seventeen or 

eighteen men to fight five hundred, unless an unavoidable necessity 

forced them to it; and that if he thought it possible for us to 

escape in the night, we had nothing else to do but to attempt it.  

He answered, if his lordship gave him such orders, he would lose 

his life if he did not perform it; we soon brought his lord to give 

that order, though privately, and we immediately prepared for 

putting it in practice.



And first, as soon as it began to be dark, we kindled a fire in our 

little camp, which we kept burning, and prepared so as to make it 

burn all night, that the Tartars might conclude we were still 

there; but as soon as it was dark, and we could see the stars (for 

our guide would not stir before), having all our horses and camels 

ready loaded, we followed our new guide, who I soon found steered 

himself by the north star, the country being level for a long way.



After we had travelled two hours very hard, it began to be lighter 

still; not that it was dark all night, but the moon began to rise, 

so that, in short, it was rather lighter than we wished it to be; 

but by six o'clock the next morning we had got above thirty miles, 

having almost spoiled our horses.  Here we found a Russian village, 

named Kermazinskoy, where we rested, and heard nothing of the 

Kalmuck Tartars that day.  About two hours before night we set out 

again, and travelled till eight the next morning, though not quite 

so hard as before; and about seven o'clock we passed a little 

river, called Kirtza, and came to a good large town inhabited by 

Russians, called Ozomys; there we heard that several troops of 

Kalmucks had been abroad upon the desert, but that we were now 

completely out of danger of them, which was to our great 

satisfaction.  Here we were obliged to get some fresh horses, and 

having need enough of rest, we stayed five days; and my partner and 

I agreed to give the honest Siberian who conducted us thither the 

value of ten pistoles.



In five days more we came to Veussima, upon the river Witzogda, and 

running into the Dwina:  we were there, very happily, near the end 

of our travels by land, that river being navigable, in seven days' 

passage, to Archangel.  From hence we came to Lawremskoy, the 3rd 

of July; and providing ourselves with two luggage boats, and a 

barge for our own convenience, we embarked the 7th, and arrived all 

safe at Archangel the 18th; having been a year, five months, and 

three days on the journey, including our stay of about eight months 

at Tobolski.



We were obliged to stay at this place six weeks for the arrival of 

the ships, and must have tarried longer, had not a Hamburgher come 

in above a month sooner than any of the English ships; when, after 

some consideration that the city of Hamburgh might happen to be as  

good a market for our goods as London, we all took freight with 

him; and, having put our goods on board, it was most natural for me 

to put my steward on board to take care of them; by which means my 

young lord had a sufficient opportunity to conceal himself, never 

coming on shore again all the time we stayed there; and this he did 

that he might not be seen in the city, where some of the Moscow 

merchants would certainly have seen and discovered him.



We then set sail from Archangel the 20th of August, the same year; 

and, after no extraordinary bad voyage, arrived safe in the Elbe 

the 18th of September.  Here my partner and I found a very good 

sale for our goods, as well those of China as the sables, &c., of 

Siberia:  and, dividing the produce, my share amounted to 3475 

pounds, 17s 3d., including about six hundred pounds' worth of 

diamonds, which I purchased at Bengal.



Here the young lord took his leave of us, and went up the Elbe, in 

order to go to the court of Vienna, where he resolved to seek 

protection and could correspond with those of his father's friends 

who were left alive.  He did not part without testimonials of 

gratitude for the service I had done him, and for my kindness to 

the prince, his father.



To conclude:  having stayed near four months in Hamburgh, I came 

from thence by land to the Hague, where I embarked in the packet, 

and arrived in London the 10th of January 1705, having been absent 

from England ten years and nine months.  And here, resolving to 

harass myself no more, I am preparing for a longer journey than all 

these, having lived seventy-two years a life of infinite variety, 

and learned sufficiently to know the value of retirement, and the 

blessing of ending our days in peace.
