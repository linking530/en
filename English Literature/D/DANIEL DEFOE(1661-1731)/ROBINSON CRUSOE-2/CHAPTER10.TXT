I WAS very angry with my nephew, the captain, and indeed with all 

the men, but with him in particular, as well for his acting so out 

of his duty as a commander of the ship, and having the charge of 

the voyage upon him, as in his prompting, rather than cooling, the 

rage of his blind men in so bloody and cruel an enterprise.  My 

nephew answered me very respectfully, but told me that when he saw 

the body of the poor seaman whom they had murdered in so cruel and 

barbarous a manner, he was not master of himself, neither could he 

govern his passion; he owned he should not have done so, as he was 

commander of the ship; but as he was a man, and nature moved him, 

he could not bear it.  As for the rest of the men, they were not 

subject to me at all, and they knew it well enough; so they took no 

notice of my dislike.  The next day we set sail, so we never heard 

any more of it.  Our men differed in the account of the number they 

had killed; but according to the best of their accounts, put all 

together, they killed or destroyed about one hundred and fifty 

people, men, women, and children, and left not a house standing in 

the town.  As for the poor fellow Tom Jeffry, as he was quite dead 

(for his throat was so cut that his head was half off), it would do 

him no service to bring him away; so they only took him down from 

the tree, where he was hanging by one hand.



However just our men thought this action, I was against them in it, 

and I always, after that time, told them God would blast the 

voyage; for I looked upon all the blood they shed that night to be 

murder in them.  For though it is true that they had killed Tom 

Jeffry, yet Jeffry was the aggressor, had broken the truce, and had 

ill-used a young woman of theirs, who came down to them innocently, 

and on the faith of the public capitulation.



The boatswain defended this quarrel when we were afterwards on 

board.  He said it was true that we seemed to break the truce, but 

really had not; and that the war was begun the night before by the 

natives themselves, who had shot at us, and killed one of our men 

without any just provocation; so that as we were in a capacity to 

fight them now, we might also be in a capacity to do ourselves 

justice upon them in an extraordinary manner; that though the poor 

man had taken a little liberty with the girl, he ought not to have 

been murdered, and that in such a villainous manner:  and that they 

did nothing but what was just and what the laws of God allowed to 

be done to murderers.  One would think this should have been enough 

to have warned us against going on shore amongst the heathens and 

barbarians; but it is impossible to make mankind wise but at their 

own expense, and their experience seems to be always of most use to 

them when it is dearest bought.



We were now bound to the Gulf of Persia, and from thence to the 

coast of Coromandel, only to touch at Surat; but the chief of the 

supercargo's design lay at the Bay of Bengal, where, if he missed 

his business outward-bound, he was to go out to China, and return 

to the coast as he came home.  The first disaster that befell us 

was in the Gulf of Persia, where five of our men, venturing on 

shore on the Arabian side of the gulf, were surrounded by the 

Arabians, and either all killed or carried away into slavery; the 

rest of the boat's crew were not able to rescue them, and had but 

just time to get off their boat.  I began to upbraid them with the 

just retribution of Heaven in this case; but the boatswain very 

warmly told me, he thought I went further in my censures than I 

could show any warrant for in Scripture; and referred to Luke xiii. 

4, where our Saviour intimates that those men on whom the Tower of 

Siloam fell were not sinners above all the Galileans; but that 

which put me to silence in the case was, that not one of these five 

men who were now lost were of those who went on shore to the 

massacre of Madagascar, so I always called it, though our men could 

not bear to hear the word MASSACRE with any patience.



But my frequent preaching to them on this subject had worse 

consequences than I expected; and the boatswain, who had been the 

head of the attempt, came up boldly to me one time, and told me he 

found that I brought that affair continually upon the stage; that I 

made unjust reflections upon it, and had used the men very ill on 

that account, and himself in particular; that as I was but a 

passenger, and had no command in the ship, or concern in the 

voyage, they were not obliged to bear it; that they did not know 

but I might have some ill-design in my head, and perhaps to call 

them to an account for it when they came to England; and that, 

therefore, unless I would resolve to have done with it, and also 

not to concern myself any further with him, or any of his affairs, 

he would leave the ship; for he did not think it safe to sail with 

me among them.



I heard him patiently enough till he had done, and then told him 

that I confessed I had all along opposed the massacre of 

Madagascar, and that I had, on all occasions, spoken my mind freely 

about it, though not more upon him than any of the rest; that as to 

having no command in the ship, that was true; nor did I exercise 

any authority, only took the liberty of speaking my mind in things 

which publicly concerned us all; and what concern I had in the 

voyage was none of his business; that I was a considerable owner in 

the ship.  In that claim I conceived I had a right to speak even 

further than I had done, and would not be accountable to him or any 

one else, and began to be a little warm with him.  He made but 

little reply to me at that time, and I thought the affair had been 

over.  We were at this time in the road at Bengal; and being 

willing to see the place, I went on shore with the supercargo in 

the ship's boat to divert myself; and towards evening was preparing 

to go on board, when one of the men came to me, and told me he 

would not have me trouble myself to come down to the boat, for they 

had orders not to carry me on board any more.  Any one may guess 

what a surprise I was in at so insolent a message; and I asked the 

man who bade him deliver that message to me?  He told me the 

coxswain.



I immediately found out the supercargo, and told him the story, 

adding that I foresaw there would be a mutiny in the ship; and 

entreated him to go immediately on board and acquaint the captain 

of it.  But I might have spared this intelligence, for before I had 

spoken to him on shore the matter was effected on board.  The 

boatswain, the gunner, the carpenter, and all the inferior 

officers, as soon as I was gone off in the boat, came up, and 

desired to speak with the captain; and then the boatswain, making a 

long harangue, and repeating all he had said to me, told the 

captain that as I was now gone peaceably on shore, they were loath 

to use any violence with me, which, if I had not gone on shore, 

they would otherwise have done, to oblige me to have gone.  They 

therefore thought fit to tell him that as they shipped themselves 

to serve in the ship under his command, they would perform it well 

and faithfully; but if I would not quit the ship, or the captain 

oblige me to quit it, they would all leave the ship, and sail no 

further with him; and at that word ALL he turned his face towards 

the main-mast, which was, it seems, a signal agreed on, when the 

seamen, being got together there, cried out, "ONE AND ALL! ONE AND 

ALL!"



My nephew, the captain, was a man of spirit, and of great presence 

of mind; and though he was surprised, yet he told them calmly that 

he would consider of the matter, but that he could do nothing in it 

till he had spoken to me about it.  He used some arguments with 

them, to show them the unreasonableness and injustice of the thing, 

but it was all in vain; they swore, and shook hands round before 

his face, that they would all go on shore unless he would engage to 

them not to suffer me to come any more on board the ship.



This was a hard article upon him, who knew his obligation to me, 

and did not know how I might take it.  So he began to talk smartly 

to them; told them that I was a very considerable owner of the 

ship, and that if ever they came to England again it would cost 

them very dear; that the ship was mine, and that he could not put 

me out of it; and that he would rather lose the ship, and the 

voyage too, than disoblige me so much:  so they might do as they 

pleased.  However, he would go on shore and talk with me, and 

invited the boatswain to go with him, and perhaps they might 

accommodate the matter with me.  But they all rejected the 

proposal, and said they would have nothing to do with me any more; 

and if I came on board they would all go on shore.  "Well," said 

the captain, "if you are all of this mind, let me go on shore and 

talk with him."  So away he came to me with this account, a little 

after the message had been brought to me from the coxswain.



I was very glad to see my nephew, I must confess; for I was not 

without apprehensions that they would confine him by violence, set 

sail, and run away with the ship; and then I had been stripped 

naked in a remote country, having nothing to help myself; in short, 

I had been in a worse case than when I was alone in the island.  

But they had not come to that length, it seems, to my satisfaction; 

and when my nephew told me what they had said to him, and how they 

had sworn and shook hands that they would, one and all, leave the 

ship if I was suffered to come on board, I told him he should not 

be concerned at it at all, for I would stay on shore.  I only 

desired he would take care and send me all my necessary things on 

shore, and leave me a sufficient sum of money, and I would find my 

way to England as well as I could.  This was a heavy piece of news 

to my nephew, but there was no way to help it but to comply; so, in 

short, he went on board the ship again, and satisfied the men that 

his uncle had yielded to their importunity, and had sent for his 

goods from on board the ship; so that the matter was over in a few 

hours, the men returned to their duty, and I began to consider what 

course I should steer.



I was now alone in a most remote part of the world, for I was near 

three thousand leagues by sea farther off from England than I was 

at my island; only, it is true, I might travel here by land over 

the Great Mogul's country to Surat, might go from thence to Bassora 

by sea, up the Gulf of Persia, and take the way of the caravans, 

over the desert of Arabia, to Aleppo and Scanderoon; from thence by 

sea again to Italy, and so overland into France.  I had another way 

before me, which was to wait for some English ships, which were 

coming to Bengal from Achin, on the island of Sumatra, and get 

passage on board them from England.  But as I came hither without 

any concern with the East Indian Company, so it would be difficult 

to go from hence without their licence, unless with great favour of 

the captains of the ships, or the company's factors:  and to both I 

was an utter stranger.



Here I had the mortification to see the ship set sail without me; 

however, my nephew left me two servants, or rather one companion 

and one servant; the first was clerk to the purser, whom he engaged 

to go with me, and the other was his own servant.  I then took a 

good lodging in the house of an Englishwoman, where several 

merchants lodged, some French, two Italians, or rather Jews, and 

one Englishman.  Here I stayed above nine months, considering what 

course to take.  I had some English goods with me of value, and a 

considerable sum of money; my nephew furnishing me with a thousand 

pieces of eight, and a letter of credit for more if I had occasion, 

that I might not be straitened, whatever might happen.  I quickly 

disposed of my goods to advantage; and, as I originally intended, I 

bought here some very good diamonds, which, of all other things, 

were the most proper for me in my present circumstances, because I 

could always carry my whole estate about me.



During my stay here many proposals were made for my return to 

England, but none falling out to my mind, the English merchant who 

lodged with me, and whom I had contracted an intimate acquaintance 

with, came to me one morning, saying:  "Countryman, I have a 

project to communicate, which, as it suits with my thoughts, may, 

for aught I know, suit with yours also, when you shall have 

thoroughly considered it.  Here we are posted, you by accident and 

I by my own choice, in a part of the world very remote from our own 

country; but it is in a country where, by us who understand trade 

and business, a great deal of money is to be got.  If you will put 

one thousand pounds to my one thousand pounds, we will hire a ship 

here, the first we can get to our minds.  You shall be captain, 

I'll be merchant, and we'll go a trading voyage to China; for what 

should we stand still for?  The whole world is in motion; why 

should we be idle?"



I liked this proposal very well; and the more so because it seemed 

to be expressed with so much goodwill.  In my loose, unhinged 

circumstances, I was the fitter to embrace a proposal for trade, or 

indeed anything else.  I might perhaps say with some truth, that if 

trade was not my element, rambling was; and no proposal for seeing 

any part of the world which I had never seen before could possibly 

come amiss to me.  It was, however, some time before we could get a 

ship to our minds, and when we had got a vessel, it was not easy to 

get English sailors - that is to say, so many as were necessary to 

govern the voyage and manage the sailors which we should pick up 

there.  After some time we got a mate, a boatswain, and a gunner, 

English; a Dutch carpenter, and three foremast men.  With these we 

found we could do well enough, having Indian seamen, such as they 

were, to make up.



When all was ready we set sail for Achin, in the island of Sumatra, 

and from thence to Siam, where we exchanged some of our wares for 

opium and some arrack; the first a commodity which bears a great 

price among the Chinese, and which at that time was much wanted 

there.  Then we went up to Saskan, were eight months out, and on 

our return to Bengal I was very well satisfied with my adventure.  

Our people in England often admire how officers, which the company 

send into India, and the merchants which generally stay there, get 

such very great estates as they do, and sometimes come home worth 

sixty or seventy thousand pounds at a time; but it is little matter 

for wonder, when we consider the innumerable ports and places where 

they have a free commerce; indeed, at the ports where the English 

ships come there is such great and constant demands for the growth 

of all other countries, that there is a certain vent for the 

returns, as well as a market abroad for the goods carried out.



I got so much money by my first adventure, and such an insight into 

the method of getting more, that had I been twenty years younger, I 

should have been tempted to have stayed here, and sought no farther 

for making my fortune; but what was all this to a man upwards of 

threescore, that was rich enough, and came abroad more in obedience 

to a restless desire of seeing the world than a covetous desire of 

gaining by it?  A restless desire it really was, for when I was at 

home I was restless to go abroad; and when I was abroad I was 

restless to be at home.  I say, what was this gain to me?  I was 

rich enough already, nor had I any uneasy desires about getting 

more money; therefore the profit of the voyage to me was of no 

great force for the prompting me forward to further undertakings.  

Hence, I thought that by this voyage I had made no progress at all, 

because I was come back, as I might call it, to the place from 

whence I came, as to a home:  whereas, my eye, like that which 

Solomon speaks of, was never satisfied with seeing.  I was come 

into a part of the world which I was never in before, and that 

part, in particular, which I heard much of, and was resolved to see 

as much of it as I could:  and then I thought I might say I had 

seen all the world that was worth seeing.



But my fellow-traveller and I had different notions:  I acknowledge 

his were the more suited to the end of a merchant's life:  who, 

when he is abroad upon adventures, is wise to stick to that, as the 

best thing for him, which he is likely to get the most money by.  

On the other hand, mine was the notion of a mad, rambling boy, that 

never cares to see a thing twice over.  But this was not all:  I 

had a kind of impatience upon me to be nearer home, and yet an 

unsettled resolution which way to go.  In the interval of these 

consultations, my friend, who was always upon the search for 

business, proposed another voyage among the Spice Islands, to bring 

home a loading of cloves from the Manillas, or thereabouts.



We were not long in preparing for this voyage; the chief difficulty 

was in bringing me to come into it.  However, at last, nothing else 

offering, and as sitting still, to me especially, was the 

unhappiest part of life, I resolved on this voyage too, which we 

made very successfully, touching at Borneo and several other 

islands, and came home in about five months, when we sold our 

spices, with very great profit, to the Persian merchants, who 

carried them away to the Gulf.  My friend, when we made up this 

account, smiled at me:  "Well, now," said he, with a sort of 

friendly rebuke on my indolent temper, "is not this better than 

walking about here, like a man with nothing to do, and spending our 

time in staring at the nonsense and ignorance of the Pagans?" - 

"Why, truly," said I, "my friend, I think it is, and I begin to be 

a convert to the principles of merchandising; but I must tell you, 

by the way, you do not know what I am doing; for if I once conquer 

my backwardness, and embark heartily, old as I am, I shall harass 

you up and down the world till I tire you; for I shall pursue it so 

eagerly, I shall never let you lie still."
