IT was five or six months after this before they heard any more of 

the savages, in which time our men were in hopes they had either 

forgot their former bad luck, or given over hopes of better; when, 

on a sudden, they were invaded with a most formidable fleet of no 

less than eight-and-twenty canoes, full of savages, armed with bows 

and arrows, great clubs, wooden swords, and such like engines of 

war; and they brought such numbers with them, that, in short, it 

put all our people into the utmost consternation.



As they came on shore in the evening, and at the easternmost side 

of the island, our men had that night to consult and consider what 

to do.  In the first place, knowing that their being entirely 

concealed was their only safety before and would be much more so 

now, while the number of their enemies would be so great, they 

resolved, first of all, to take down the huts which were built for 

the two Englishmen, and drive away their goats to the old cave; 

because they supposed the savages would go directly thither, as 

soon as it was day, to play the old game over again, though they 

did not now land within two leagues of it.  In the next place, they 

drove away all the flocks of goats they had at the old bower, as I 

called it, which belonged to the Spaniards; and, in short, left as 

little appearance of inhabitants anywhere as was possible; and the 

next morning early they posted themselves, with all their force, at 

the plantation of the two men, to wait for their coming.  As they 

guessed, so it happened:  these new invaders, leaving their canoes 

at the east end of the island, came ranging along the shore, 

directly towards the place, to the number of two hundred and fifty, 

as near as our men could judge.  Our army was but small indeed; 

but, that which was worse, they had not arms for all their number.  

The whole account, it seems, stood thus:  first, as to men, 

seventeen Spaniards, five Englishmen, old Friday, the three slaves 

taken with the women, who proved very faithful, and three other 

slaves, who lived with the Spaniards.  To arm these, they had 

eleven muskets, five pistols, three fowling-pieces, five muskets or 

fowling-pieces which were taken by me from the mutinous seamen whom 

I reduced, two swords, and three old halberds.



To their slaves they did not give either musket or fusee; but they 

had each a halberd, or a long staff, like a quarter-staff, with a 

great spike of iron fastened into each end of it, and by his side a 

hatchet; also every one of our men had a hatchet.  Two of the women 

could not be prevailed upon but they would come into the fight, and 

they had bows and arrows, which the Spaniards had taken from the 

savages when the first action happened, which I have spoken of, 

where the Indians fought with one another; and the women had 

hatchets too.



The chief Spaniard, whom I described so often, commanded the whole; 

and Will Atkins, who, though a dreadful fellow for wickedness, was 

a most daring, bold fellow, commanded under him.  The savages came 

forward like lions; and our men, which was the worst of their fate, 

had no advantage in their situation; only that Will Atkins, who now 

proved a most useful fellow, with six men, was planted just behind 

a small thicket of bushes as an advanced guard, with orders to let 

the first of them pass by and then fire into the middle of them, 

and as soon as he had fired, to make his retreat as nimbly as he 

could round a part of the wood, and so come in behind the 

Spaniards, where they stood, having a thicket of trees before them.



When the savages came on, they ran straggling about every way in 

heaps, out of all manner of order, and Will Atkins let about fifty 

of them pass by him; then seeing the rest come in a very thick 

throng, he orders three of his men to fire, having loaded their 

muskets with six or seven bullets apiece, about as big as large 

pistol-bullets.  How many they killed or wounded they knew not, but 

the consternation and surprise was inexpressible among the savages; 

they were frightened to the last degree to hear such a dreadful 

noise, and see their men killed, and others hurt, but see nobody 

that did it; when, in the middle of their fright, Will Atkins and 

his other three let fly again among the thickest of them; and in 

less than a minute the first three, being loaded again, gave them a 

third volley.



Had Will Atkins and his men retired immediately, as soon as they 

had fired, as they were ordered to do, or had the rest of the body 

been at hand to have poured in their shot continually, the savages 

had been effectually routed; for the terror that was among them 

came principally from this, that they were killed by the gods with 

thunder and lightning, and could see nobody that hurt them.  But 

Will Atkins, staying to load again, discovered the cheat:  some of 

the savages who were at a distance spying them, came upon them 

behind; and though Atkins and his men fired at them also, two or 

three times, and killed above twenty, retiring as fast as they 

could, yet they wounded Atkins himself, and killed one of his 

fellow-Englishmen with their arrows, as they did afterwards one 

Spaniard, and one of the Indian slaves who came with the women.  

This slave was a most gallant fellow, and fought most desperately, 

killing five of them with his own hand, having no weapon but one of 

the armed staves and a hatchet.



Our men being thus hard laid at, Atkins wounded, and two other men 

killed, retreated to a rising ground in the wood; and the 

Spaniards, after firing three volleys upon them, retreated also; 

for their number was so great, and they were so desperate, that 

though above fifty of them were killed, and more than as many 

wounded, yet they came on in the teeth of our men, fearless of 

danger, and shot their arrows like a cloud; and it was observed 

that their wounded men, who were not quite disabled, were made 

outrageous by their wounds, and fought like madmen.



When our men retreated, they left the Spaniard and the Englishman 

that were killed behind them:  and the savages, when they came up 

to them, killed them over again in a wretched manner, breaking 

their arms, legs, and heads, with their clubs and wooden swords, 

like true savages; but finding our men were gone, they did not seem 

inclined to pursue them, but drew themselves up in a ring, which 

is, it seems, their custom, and shouted twice, in token of their 

victory; after which, they had the mortification to see several of 

their wounded men fall, dying with the mere loss of blood.



The Spaniard governor having drawn his little body up together upon 

a rising ground, Atkins, though he was wounded, would have had them 

march and charge again all together at once:  but the Spaniard 

replied, "Seignior Atkins, you see how their wounded men fight; let 

them alone till morning; all the wounded men will be stiff and sore 

with their wounds, and faint with the loss of blood; and so we 

shall have the fewer to engage."  This advice was good:  but Will 

Atkins replied merrily, "That is true, seignior, and so shall I 

too; and that is the reason I would go on while I am warm."  "Well, 

Seignior Atkins," says the Spaniard, "you have behaved gallantly, 

and done your part; we will fight for you if you cannot come on; 

but I think it best to stay till morning:" so they waited.



But as it was a clear moonlight night, and they found the savages 

in great disorder about their dead and wounded men, and a great 

noise and hurry among them where they lay, they afterwards resolved 

to fall upon them in the night, especially if they could come to 

give them but one volley before they were discovered, which they 

had a fair opportunity to do; for one of the Englishmen in whose 

quarter it was where the fight began, led them round between the 

woods and the seaside westward, and then turning short south, they 

came so near where the thickest of them lay, that before they were 

seen or heard eight of them fired in among them, and did dreadful 

execution upon them; in half a minute more eight others fired after 

them, pouring in their small shot in such a quantity that abundance 

were killed and wounded; and all this while they were not able to 

see who hurt them, or which way to fly.



The Spaniards charged again with the utmost expedition, and then 

divided themselves into three bodies, and resolved to fall in among 

them all together.  They had in each body eight persons, that is to 

say, twenty-two men and the two women, who, by the way, fought 

desperately.  They divided the firearms equally in each party, as 

well as the halberds and staves.  They would have had the women 

kept back, but they said they were resolved to die with their 

husbands.  Having thus formed their little army, they marched out 

from among the trees, and came up to the teeth of the enemy, 

shouting and hallooing as loud as they could; the savages stood all 

together, but were in the utmost confusion, hearing the noise of 

our men shouting from three quarters together.  They would have 

fought if they had seen us; for as soon as we came near enough to 

be seen, some arrows were shot, and poor old Friday was wounded, 

though not dangerously.  But our men gave them no time, but running 

up to them, fired among them three ways, and then fell in with the 

butt-ends of their muskets, their swords, armed staves, and 

hatchets, and laid about them so well that, in a word, they set up 

a dismal screaming and howling, flying to save their lives which 

way soever they could.



Our men were tired with the execution, and killed or mortally 

wounded in the two fights about one hundred and eighty of them; the 

rest, being frightened out of their wits, scoured through the woods 

and over the hills, with all the speed that fear and nimble feet 

could help them to; and as we did not trouble ourselves much to 

pursue them, they got all together to the seaside, where they 

landed, and where their canoes lay.  But their disaster was not at 

an end yet; for it blew a terrible storm of wind that evening from 

the sea, so that it was impossible for them to go off; nay, the 

storm continuing all night, when the tide came up their canoes were 

most of them driven by the surge of the sea so high upon the shore 

that it required infinite toil to get them off; and some of them 

were even dashed to pieces against the beach.  Our men, though glad 

of their victory, yet got little rest that night; but having 

refreshed themselves as well as they could, they resolved to march 

to that part of the island where the savages were fled, and see 

what posture they were in.  This necessarily led them over the 

place where the fight had been, and where they found several of the 

poor creatures not quite dead, and yet past recovering life; a 

sight disagreeable enough to generous minds, for a truly great man 

though obliged by the law of battle to destroy his enemy, takes no 

delight in his misery.  However, there was no need to give any 

orders in this case; for their own savages, who were their 

servants, despatched these poor creatures with their hatchets.



At length they came in view of the place where the more miserable 

remains of the savages' army lay, where there appeared about a 

hundred still; their posture was generally sitting upon the ground, 

with their knees up towards their mouth, and the head put between 

the two hands, leaning down upon the knees.  When our men came 

within two musket-shots of them, the Spaniard governor ordered two 

muskets to be fired without ball, to alarm them; this he did, that 

by their countenance he might know what to expect, whether they 

were still in heart to fight, or were so heartily beaten as to be 

discouraged, and so he might manage accordingly.  This stratagem 

took:  for as soon as the savages heard the first gun, and saw the 

flash of the second, they started up upon their feet in the 

greatest consternation imaginable; and as our men advanced swiftly 

towards them, they all ran screaming and yelling away, with a kind 

of howling noise, which our men did not understand, and had never 

heard before; and thus they ran up the hills into the country.



At first our men had much rather the weather had been calm, and 

they had all gone away to sea:  but they did not then consider that 

this might probably have been the occasion of their coming again in 

such multitudes as not to be resisted, or, at least, to come so 

many and so often as would quite desolate the island, and starve 

them.  Will Atkins, therefore, who notwithstanding his wound kept 

always with them, proved the best counsellor in this case:  his 

advice was, to take the advantage that offered, and step in between 

them and their boats, and so deprive them of the capacity of ever 

returning any more to plague the island.  They consulted long about 

this; and some were against it for fear of making the wretches fly 

to the woods and live there desperate, and so they should have them 

to hunt like wild beasts, be afraid to stir out about their 

business, and have their plantations continually rifled, all their 

tame goats destroyed, and, in short, be reduced to a life of 

continual distress.



Will Atkins told them they had better have to do with a hundred men 

than with a hundred nations; that, as they must destroy their 

boats, so they must destroy the men, or be all of them destroyed 

themselves.  In a word, he showed them the necessity of it so 

plainly that they all came into it; so they went to work 

immediately with the boats, and getting some dry wood together from 

a dead tree, they tried to set some of them on fire, but they were 

so wet that they would not burn; however, the fire so burned the 

upper part that it soon made them unfit for use at sea.



When the Indians saw what they were about, some of them came 

running out of the woods, and coming as near as they could to our 

men, kneeled down and cried, "Oa, Oa, Waramokoa," and some other 

words of their language, which none of the others understood 

anything of; but as they made pitiful gestures and strange noises, 

it was easy to understand they begged to have their boats spared, 

and that they would be gone, and never come there again.  But our 

men were now satisfied that they had no way to preserve themselves, 

or to save their colony, but effectually to prevent any of these 

people from ever going home again; depending upon this, that if 

even so much as one of them got back into their country to tell the 

story, the colony was undone; so that, letting them know that they 

should not have any mercy, they fell to work with their canoes, and 

destroyed every one that the storm had not destroyed before; at the 

sight of which, the savages raised a hideous cry in the woods, 

which our people heard plain enough, after which they ran about the 

island like distracted men, so that, in a word, our men did not 

really know what at first to do with them.  Nor did the Spaniards, 

with all their prudence, consider that while they made those people 

thus desperate, they ought to have kept a good guard at the same 

time upon their plantations; for though it is true they had driven 

away their cattle, and the Indians did not find out their main 

retreat, I mean my old castle at the hill, nor the cave in the 

valley, yet they found out my plantation at the bower, and pulled 

it all to pieces, and all the fences and planting about it; trod 

all the corn under foot, tore up the vines and grapes, being just 

then almost ripe, and did our men inestimable damage, though to 

themselves not one farthing's worth of service.



Though our men were able to fight them upon all occasions, yet they 

were in no condition to pursue them, or hunt them up and down; for 

as they were too nimble of foot for our people when they found them 

single, so our men durst not go abroad single, for fear of being 

surrounded with their numbers.  The best was they had no weapons; 

for though they had bows, they had no arrows left, nor any 

materials to make any; nor had they any edge-tool among them.  The 

extremity and distress they were reduced to was great, and indeed 

deplorable; but, at the same time, our men were also brought to 

very bad circumstances by them, for though their retreats were 

preserved, yet their provision was destroyed, and their harvest 

spoiled, and what to do, or which way to turn themselves, they knew 

not.  The only refuge they had now was the stock of cattle they had 

in the valley by the cave, and some little corn which grew there, 

and the plantation of the three Englishmen.  Will Atkins and his 

comrades were now reduced to two; one of them being killed by an 

arrow, which struck him on the side of his head, just under the 

temple, so that he never spoke more; and it was very remarkable 

that this was the same barbarous fellow that cut the poor savage 

slave with his hatchet, and who afterwards intended to have 

murdered the Spaniards.



I looked upon their case to have been worse at this time than mine 

was at any time, after I first discovered the grains of barley and 

rice, and got into the manner of planting and raising my corn, and 

my tame cattle; for now they had, as I may say, a hundred wolves 

upon the island, which would devour everything they could come at, 

yet could be hardly come at themselves.



When they saw what their circumstances were, the first thing they 

concluded was, that they would, if possible, drive the savages up 

to the farther part of the island, south-west, that if any more 

came on shore they might not find one another; then, that they 

would daily hunt and harass them, and kill as many of them as they 

could come at, till they had reduced their number; and if they 

could at last tame them, and bring them to anything, they would 

give them corn, and teach them how to plant, and live upon their 

daily labour.  In order to do this, they so followed them, and so 

terrified them with their guns, that in a few days, if any of them 

fired a gun at an Indian, if he did not hit him, yet he would fall 

down for fear.  So dreadfully frightened were they that they kept 

out of sight farther and farther; till at last our men followed 

them, and almost every day killing or wounding some of them, they 

kept up in the woods or hollow places so much, that it reduced them 

to the utmost misery for want of food; and many were afterwards 

found dead in the woods, without any hurt, absolutely starved to 

death.



When our men found this, it made their hearts relent, and pity 

moved them, especially the generous-minded Spaniard governor; and 

he proposed, if possible, to take one of them alive and bring him 

to understand what they meant, so far as to be able to act as 

interpreter, and go among them and see if they might be brought to 

some conditions that might be depended upon, to save their lives 

and do us no harm.



It was some while before any of them could be taken; but being weak 

and half-starved, one of them was at last surprised and made a 

prisoner.  He was sullen at first, and would neither eat nor drink; 

but finding himself kindly used, and victuals given to him, and no 

violence offered him, he at last grew tractable, and came to 

himself.  They often brought old Friday to talk to him, who always 

told him how kind the others would be to them all; that they would 

not only save their lives, but give them part of the island to live 

in, provided they would give satisfaction that they would keep in 

their own bounds, and not come beyond it to injure or prejudice 

others; and that they should have corn given them to plant and make 

it grow for their bread, and some bread given them for their 

present subsistence; and old Friday bade the fellow go and talk 

with the rest of his countrymen, and see what they said to it; 

assuring them that, if they did not agree immediately, they should 

be all destroyed.



The poor wretches, thoroughly humbled, and reduced in number to 

about thirty-seven, closed with the proposal at the first offer, 

and begged to have some food given them; upon which twelve 

Spaniards and two Englishmen, well armed, with three Indian slaves 

and old Friday, marched to the place where they were.  The three 

Indian slaves carried them a large quantity of bread, some rice 

boiled up to cakes and dried in the sun, and three live goats; and 

they were ordered to go to the side of a hill, where they sat down, 

ate their provisions very thankfully, and were the most faithful 

fellows to their words that could be thought of; for, except when 

they came to beg victuals and directions, they never came out of 

their bounds; and there they lived when I came to the island and I 

went to see them.  They had taught them both to plant corn, make 

bread, breed tame goats, and milk them:  they wanted nothing but 

wives in order for them soon to become a nation.  They were 

confined to a neck of land, surrounded with high rocks behind them, 

and lying plain towards the sea before them, on the south-east 

corner of the island.  They had land enough, and it was very good 

and fruitful; about a mile and a half broad, and three or four 

miles in length.  Our men taught them to make wooden spades, such 

as I made for myself, and gave among them twelve hatchets and three 

or four knives; and there they lived, the most subjected, innocent 

creatures that ever were heard of.



After this the colony enjoyed a perfect tranquillity with respect 

to the savages, till I came to revisit them, which was about two 

years after; not but that, now and then, some canoes of savages 

came on shore for their triumphal, unnatural feasts; but as they 

were of several nations, and perhaps had never heard of those that 

came before, or the reason of it, they did not make any search or 

inquiry after their countrymen; and if they had, it would have been 

very hard to have found them out.



Thus, I think, I have given a full account of all that happened to 

them till my return, at least that was worth notice.  The Indians 

were wonderfully civilised by them, and they frequently went among 

them; but they forbid, on pain of death, any one of the Indians 

coming to them, because they would not have their settlement 

betrayed again.  One thing was very remarkable, viz. that they 

taught the savages to make wicker-work, or baskets, but they soon 

outdid their masters:  for they made abundance of ingenious things 

in wicker-work, particularly baskets, sieves, bird-cages, 

cupboards, &c.; as also chairs, stools, beds, couches, being very 

ingenious at such work when they were once put in the way of it.



My coming was a particular relief to these people, because we 

furnished them with knives, scissors, spades, shovels, pick-axes, 

and all things of that kind which they could want.  With the help 

of those tools they were so very handy that they came at last to 

build up their huts or houses very handsomely, raddling or working 

it up like basket-work all the way round.  This piece of ingenuity, 

although it looked very odd, was an exceeding good fence, as well 

against heat as against all sorts of vermin; and our men were so 

taken with it that they got the Indians to come and do the like for 

them; so that when I came to see the two Englishmen's colonies, 

they looked at a distance as if they all lived like bees in a hive.



As for Will Atkins, who was now become a very industrious, useful, 

and sober fellow, he had made himself such a tent of basket-work as 

I believe was never seen; it was one hundred and twenty paces round 

on the outside, as I measured by my steps; the walls were as close 

worked as a basket, in panels or squares of thirty-two in number, 

and very strong, standing about seven feet high; in the middle was 

another not above twenty-two paces round, but built stronger, being 

octagon in its form, and in the eight corners stood eight very 

strong posts; round the top of which he laid strong pieces, knit 

together with wooden pins, from which he raised a pyramid for a 

handsome roof of eight rafters, joined together very well, though 

he had no nails, and only a few iron spikes, which he made himself, 

too, out of the old iron that I had left there.  Indeed, this 

fellow showed abundance of ingenuity in several things which he had 

no knowledge of:  he made him a forge, with a pair of wooden 

bellows to blow the fire; he made himself charcoal for his work; 

and he formed out of the iron crows a middling good anvil to hammer 

upon:  in this manner he made many things, but especially hooks, 

staples, and spikes, bolts and hinges.  But to return to the house:  

after he had pitched the roof of his innermost tent, he worked it 

up between the rafters with basket-work, so firm, and thatched that 

over again so ingeniously with rice-straw, and over that a large 

leaf of a tree, which covered the top, that his house was as dry as 

if it had been tiled or slated.  He owned, indeed, that the savages 

had made the basket-work for him.  The outer circuit was covered as 

a lean-to all round this inner apartment, and long rafters lay from 

the thirty-two angles to the top posts of the inner house, being 

about twenty feet distant, so that there was a space like a walk 

within the outer wicker-wall, and without the inner, near twenty 

feet wide.



The inner place he partitioned off with the same wickerwork, but 

much fairer, and divided into six apartments, so that he had six 

rooms on a floor, and out of every one of these there was a door:  

first into the entry, or coming into the main tent, another door 

into the main tent, and another door into the space or walk that 

was round it; so that walk was also divided into six equal parts, 

which served not only for a retreat, but to store up any 

necessaries which the family had occasion for.  These six spaces 

not taking up the whole circumference, what other apartments the 

outer circle had were thus ordered:  As soon as you were in at the 

door of the outer circle you had a short passage straight before 

you to the door of the inner house; but on either side was a wicker 

partition and a door in it, by which you went first into a large 

room or storehouse, twenty feet wide and about thirty feet long, 

and through that into another not quite so long; so that in the 

outer circle were ten handsome rooms, six of which were only to be 

come at through the apartments of the inner tent, and served as 

closets or retiring rooms to the respective chambers of the inner 

circle; and four large warehouses, or barns, or what you please to 

call them, which went through one another, two on either hand of 

the passage, that led through the outer door to the inner tent.  

Such a piece of basket-work, I believe, was never seen in the 

world, nor a house or tent so neatly contrived, much less so built.  

In this great bee-hive lived the three families, that is to say, 

Will Atkins and his companion; the third was killed, but his wife 

remained with three children, and the other two were not at all 

backward to give the widow her full share of everything, I mean as 

to their corn, milk, grapes, &c., and when they killed a kid, or 

found a turtle on the shore; so that they all lived well enough; 

though it was true they were not so industrious as the other two, 

as has been observed already.



One thing, however, cannot be omitted, viz. that as for religion, I 

do not know that there was anything of that kind among them; they 

often, indeed, put one another in mind that there was a God, by the 

very common method of seamen, swearing by His name:  nor were their 

poor ignorant savage wives much better for having been married to 

Christians, as we must call them; for as they knew very little of 

God themselves, so they were utterly incapable of entering into any 

discourse with their wives about a God, or to talk anything to them 

concerning religion.



The utmost of all the improvement which I can say the wives had 

made from them was, that they had taught them to speak English 

pretty well; and most of their children, who were near twenty in 

all, were taught to speak English too, from their first learning to 

speak, though they at first spoke it in a very broken manner, like 

their mothers.  None of these children were above six years old 

when I came thither, for it was not much above seven years since 

they had fetched these five savage ladies over; they had all 

children, more or less:  the mothers were all a good sort of well-

governed, quiet, laborious women, modest and decent, helpful to one 

another, mighty observant, and subject to their masters (I cannot 

call them husbands), and lacked nothing but to be well instructed 

in the Christian religion, and to be legally married; both of which 

were happily brought about afterwards by my means, or at least in 

consequence of my coming among them.
