BUT not to crowd this part with an account of the lesser part of 

the rogueries with which they plagued them continually, night and 

day, it forced the two men to such a desperation that they resolved 

to fight them all three, the first time they had a fair 

opportunity.  In order to do this they resolved to go to the castle 

(as they called my old dwelling), where the three rogues and the 

Spaniards all lived together at that time, intending to have a fair 

battle, and the Spaniards should stand by to see fair play:  so 

they got up in the morning before day, and came to the place, and 

called the Englishmen by their names telling a Spaniard that 

answered that they wanted to speak with them.



It happened that the day before two of the Spaniards, having been 

in the woods, had seen one of the two Englishmen, whom, for 

distinction, I called the honest men, and he had made a sad 

complaint to the Spaniards of the barbarous usage they had met with 

from their three countrymen, and how they had ruined their 

plantation, and destroyed their corn, that they had laboured so 

hard to bring forward, and killed the milch-goat and their three 

kids, which was all they had provided for their sustenance, and 

that if he and his friends, meaning the Spaniards, did not assist 

them again, they should be starved.  When the Spaniards came home 

at night, and they were all at supper, one of them took the freedom 

to reprove the three Englishmen, though in very gentle and mannerly 

terms, and asked them how they could be so cruel, they being 

harmless, inoffensive fellows:  that they were putting themselves 

in a way to subsist by their labour, and that it had cost them a 

great deal of pains to bring things to such perfection as they were 

then in.



One of the Englishmen returned very briskly, "What had they to do 

there? that they came on shore without leave; and that they should 

not plant or build upon the island; it was none of their ground."  

"Why," says the Spaniard, very calmly, "Seignior Inglese, they must 

not starve."  The Englishman replied, like a rough tarpaulin, "They 

might starve; they should not plant nor build in that place."  "But 

what must they do then, seignior?" said the Spaniard.  Another of 

the brutes returned, "Do? they should be servants, and work for 

them."  "But how can you expect that of them?" says the Spaniard; 

"they are not bought with your money; you have no right to make 

them servants."  The Englishman answered, "The island was theirs; 

the governor had given it to them, and no man had anything to do 

there but themselves;" and with that he swore that he would go and 

burn all their new huts; they should build none upon their land.  

"Why, seignior," says the Spaniard, "by the same rule, we must be 

your servants, too."  "Ay," returned the bold dog, "and so you 

shall, too, before we have done with you;" mixing two or three 

oaths in the proper intervals of his speech.  The Spaniard only 

smiled at that, and made him no answer.  However, this little 

discourse had heated them; and starting up, one says to the other.  

(I think it was he they called Will Atkins), "Come, Jack, let's go 

and have t'other brush with them; we'll demolish their castle, I'll 

warrant you; they shall plant no colony in our dominions."



Upon this they were all trooping away, with every man a gun, a 

pistol, and a sword, and muttered some insolent things among 

themselves of what they would do to the Spaniards, too, when 

opportunity offered; but the Spaniards, it seems, did not so 

perfectly understand them as to know all the particulars, only that 

in general they threatened them hard for taking the two 

Englishmen's part.  Whither they went, or how they bestowed their 

time that evening, the Spaniards said they did not know; but it 

seems they wandered about the country part of the night, and them 

lying down in the place which I used to call my bower, they were 

weary and overslept themselves.  The case was this:  they had 

resolved to stay till midnight, and so take the two poor men when 

they were asleep, and as they acknowledged afterwards, intended to 

set fire to their huts while they were in them, and either burn 

them there or murder them as they came out.  As malice seldom 

sleeps very sound, it was very strange they should not have been 

kept awake.  However, as the two men had also a design upon them, 

as I have said, though a much fairer one than that of burning and 

murdering, it happened, and very luckily for them all, that they 

were up and gone abroad before the bloody-minded rogues came to 

their huts.



When they came there, and found the men gone, Atkins, who it seems 

was the forwardest man, called out to his comrade, "Ha, Jack, 

here's the nest, but the birds are flown."  They mused a while, to 

think what should be the occasion of their being gone abroad so 

soon, and suggested presently that the Spaniards had given them 

notice of it; and with that they shook hands, and swore to one 

another that they would be revenged of the Spaniards.  As soon as 

they had made this bloody bargain they fell to work with the poor 

men's habitation; they did not set fire, indeed, to anything, but 

they pulled down both their houses, and left not the least stick 

standing, or scarce any sign on the ground where they stood; they 

tore all their household stuff in pieces, and threw everything 

about in such a manner, that the poor men afterwards found some of 

their things a mile off.  When they had done this, they pulled up 

all the young trees which the poor men had planted; broke down an 

enclosure they had made to secure their cattle and their corn; and, 

in a word, sacked and plundered everything as completely as a horde 

of Tartars would have done.



The two men were at this juncture gone to find them out, and had 

resolved to fight them wherever they had been, though they were but 

two to three; so that, had they met, there certainly would have 

been blood shed among them, for they were all very stout, resolute 

fellows, to give them their due.



But Providence took more care to keep them asunder than they 

themselves could do to meet; for, as if they had dogged one 

another, when the three were gone thither, the two were here; and 

afterwards, when the two went back to find them, the three were 

come to the old habitation again:  we shall see their different 

conduct presently.  When the three came back like furious 

creatures, flushed with the rage which the work they had been about 

had put them into, they came up to the Spaniards, and told them 

what they had done, by way of scoff and bravado; and one of them 

stepping up to one of the Spaniards, as if they had been a couple 

of boys at play, takes hold of his hat as it was upon his head, and 

giving it a twirl about, fleering in his face, says to him, "And 

you, Seignior Jack Spaniard, shall have the same sauce if you do 

not mend your manners."  The Spaniard, who, though a quiet civil 

man, was as brave a man as could be, and withal a strong, well-made 

man, looked at him for a good while, and then, having no weapon in 

his hand, stepped gravely up to him, and, with one blow of his 

fist, knocked him down, as an ox is felled with a pole-axe; at 

which one of the rogues, as insolent as the first, fired his pistol 

at the Spaniard immediately; he missed his body, indeed, for the 

bullets went through his hair, but one of them touched the tip of 

his ear, and he bled pretty much.  The blood made the Spaniard 

believe he was more hurt than he really was, and that put him into 

some heat, for before he acted all in a perfect calm; but now 

resolving to go through with his work, he stooped, and taking the 

fellow's musket whom he had knocked down, was just going to shoot 

the man who had fired at him, when the rest of the Spaniards, being 

in the cave, came out, and calling to him not to shoot, they 

stepped in, secured the other two, and took their arms from them.



When they were thus disarmed, and found they had made all the 

Spaniards their enemies, as well as their own countrymen, they 

began to cool, and giving the Spaniards better words, would have 

their arms again; but the Spaniards, considering the feud that was 

between them and the other two Englishmen, and that it would be the 

best method they could take to keep them from killing one another, 

told them they would do them no harm, and if they would live 

peaceably, they would be very willing to assist and associate with 

them as they did before; but that they could not think of giving 

them their arms again, while they appeared so resolved to do 

mischief with them to their own countrymen, and had even threatened 

them all to make them their servants.



The rogues were now quite deaf to all reason, and being refused 

their arms, they raved away like madmen, threatening what they 

would do, though they had no firearms.  But the Spaniards, 

despising their threatening, told them they should take care how 

they offered any injury to their plantation or cattle; for if they 

did they would shoot them as they would ravenous beasts, wherever 

they found them; and if they fell into their hands alive, they 

should certainly be hanged.  However, this was far from cooling 

them, but away they went, raging and swearing like furies.  As soon 

as they were gone, the two men came back, in passion and rage 

enough also, though of another kind; for having been at their 

plantation, and finding it all demolished and destroyed, as above 

mentioned, it will easily be supposed they had provocation enough.  

They could scarce have room to tell their tale, the Spaniards were 

so eager to tell them theirs:  and it was strange enough to find 

that three men should thus bully nineteen, and receive no 

punishment at all.



The Spaniards, indeed, despised them, and especially, having thus 

disarmed them, made light of their threatenings; but the two 

Englishmen resolved to have their remedy against them, what pains 

soever it cost to find them out.  But the Spaniards interposed here 

too, and told them that as they had disarmed them, they could not 

consent that they (the two) should pursue them with firearms, and 

perhaps kill them.  "But," said the grave Spaniard, who was their 

governor, "we will endeavour to make them do you justice, if you 

will leave it to us:  for there is no doubt but they will come to 

us again, when their passion is over, being not able to subsist 

without our assistance.  We promise you to make no peace with them 

without having full satisfaction for you; and upon this condition 

we hope you will promise to use no violence with them, other than 

in your own defence."  The two Englishmen yielded to this very 

awkwardly, and with great reluctance; but the Spaniards protested 

that they did it only to keep them from bloodshed, and to make them 

all easy at last.  "For," said they, "we are not so many of us; 

here is room enough for us all, and it is a great pity that we 

should not be all good friends."  At length they did consent, and 

waited for the issue of the thing, living for some days with the 

Spaniards; for their own habitation was destroyed.



In about five days' time the vagrants, tired with wandering, and 

almost starved with hunger, having chiefly lived on turtles' eggs 

all that while, came back to the grove; and finding my Spaniard, 

who, as I have said, was the governor, and two more with him, 

walking by the side of the creek, they came up in a very 

submissive, humble manner, and begged to be received again into the 

society.  The Spaniards used them civilly, but told them they had 

acted so unnaturally to their countrymen, and so very grossly to 

themselves, that they could not come to any conclusion without 

consulting the two Englishmen and the rest; but, however, they 

would go to them and discourse about it, and they should know in 

half-an-hour.  It may be guessed that they were very hard put to 

it; for, as they were to wait this half-hour for an answer, they 

begged they would send them out some bread in the meantime, which 

they did, sending at the same time a large piece of goat's flesh 

and a boiled parrot, which they ate very eagerly.



After half-an-hour's consultation they were called in, and a long 

debate ensued, their two countrymen charging them with the ruin of 

all their labour, and a design to murder them; all which they owned 

before, and therefore could not deny now.  Upon the whole, the 

Spaniards acted the moderators between them; and as they had 

obliged the two Englishmen not to hurt the three while they were 

naked and unarmed, so they now obliged the three to go and rebuild 

their fellows' two huts, one to be of the same and the other of 

larger dimensions than they were before; to fence their ground 

again, plant trees in the room of those pulled up, dig up the land 

again for planting corn, and, in a word, to restore everything to 

the same state as they found it, that is, as near as they could.



Well, they submitted to all this; and as they had plenty of 

provisions given them all the while, they grew very orderly, and 

the whole society began to live pleasantly and agreeably together 

again; only that these three fellows could never be persuaded to 

work - I mean for themselves - except now and then a little, just 

as they pleased.  However, the Spaniards told them plainly that if 

they would but live sociably and friendly together, and study the 

good of the whole plantation, they would be content to work for 

them, and let them walk about and be as idle as they pleased; and 

thus, having lived pretty well together for a month or two, the 

Spaniards let them have arms again, and gave them liberty to go 

abroad with them as before.



It was not above a week after they had these arms, and went abroad, 

before the ungrateful creatures began to be as insolent and 

troublesome as ever.  However, an accident happened presently upon 

this, which endangered the safety of them all, and they were 

obliged to lay by all private resentments, and look to the 

preservation of their lives.



It happened one night that the governor, the Spaniard whose life I 

had saved, who was now the governor of the rest, found himself very 

uneasy in the night, and could by no means get any sleep:  he was 

perfectly well in body, only found his thoughts tumultuous; his 

mind ran upon men fighting and killing one another; but he was 

broad awake, and could not by any means get any sleep; in short, he 

lay a great while, but growing more and more uneasy, he resolved to 

rise.  As they lay, being so many of them, on goat-skins laid thick 

upon such couches and pads as they made for themselves, so they had 

little to do, when they were willing to rise, but to get upon their 

feet, and perhaps put on a coat, such as it was, and their pumps, 

and they were ready for going any way that their thoughts guided 

them.  Being thus got up, he looked out; but being dark, he could 

see little or nothing, and besides, the trees which I had planted, 

and which were now grown tall, intercepted his sight, so that he 

could only look up, and see that it was a starlight night, and 

hearing no noise, he returned and lay down again; but to no 

purpose; he could not compose himself to anything like rest; but 

his thoughts were to the last degree uneasy, and he knew not for 

what.  Having made some noise with rising and walking about, going 

out and coming in, another of them waked, and asked who it was that 

was up.  The governor told him how it had been with him.  "Say you 

so?" says the other Spaniard; "such things are not to be slighted, 

I assure you; there is certainly some mischief working near us;" 

and presently he asked him, "Where are the Englishmen?"  "They are 

all in their huts," says he, "safe enough."  It seems the Spaniards 

had kept possession of the main apartment, and had made a place for 

the three Englishmen, who, since their last mutiny, were always 

quartered by themselves, and could not come at the rest.  "Well," 

says the Spaniard, "there is something in it, I am persuaded, from 

my own experience.  I am satisfied that our spirits embodied have a 

converse with and receive intelligence from the spirits unembodied, 

and inhabiting the invisible world; and this friendly notice is 

given for our advantage, if we knew how to make use of it.  Come, 

let us go and look abroad; and if we find nothing at all in it to 

justify the trouble, I'll tell you a story to the purpose, that 

shall convince you of the justice of my proposing it."



They went out presently to go up to the top of the hill, where I 

used to go; but they being strong, and a good company, nor alone, 

as I was, used none of my cautions to go up by the ladder, and 

pulling it up after them, to go up a second stage to the top, but 

were going round through the grove unwarily, when they were 

surprised with seeing a light as of fire, a very little way from 

them, and hearing the voices of men, not of one or two, but of a 

great number.



Among the precautions I used to take on the savages landing on the 

island, it was my constant care to prevent them making the least 

discovery of there being any inhabitant upon the place:  and when 

by any occasion they came to know it, they felt it so effectually 

that they that got away were scarce able to give any account of it; 

for we disappeared as soon as possible, nor did ever any that had 

seen me escape to tell any one else, except it was the three 

savages in our last encounter who jumped into the boat; of whom, I 

mentioned, I was afraid they should go home and bring more help.  

Whether it was the consequence of the escape of those men that so 

great a number came now together, or whether they came ignorantly, 

and by accident, on their usual bloody errand, the Spaniards could 

not understand; but whatever it was, it was their business either 

to have concealed themselves or not to have seen them at all, much 

less to have let the savages have seen there were any inhabitants 

in the place; or to have fallen upon them so effectually as not a 

man of them should have escaped, which could only have been by 

getting in between them and their boats; but this presence of mind 

was wanting to them, which was the ruin of their tranquillity for a 

great while.



We need not doubt but that the governor and the man with him, 

surprised with this sight, ran back immediately and raised their 

fellows, giving them an account of the imminent danger they were 

all in, and they again as readily took the alarm; but it was 

impossible to persuade them to stay close within where they were, 

but they must all run out to see how things stood.  While it was 

dark, indeed, they were safe, and they had opportunity enough for 

some hours to view the savages by the light of three fires they had 

made at a distance from one another; what they were doing they knew 

not, neither did they know what to do themselves.  For, first, the 

enemy were too many; and secondly, they did not keep together, but 

were divided into several parties, and were on shore in several 

places.



The Spaniards were in no small consternation at this sight; and, as 

they found that the fellows went straggling all over the shore, 

they made no doubt but, first or last, some of them would chop in 

upon their habitation, or upon some other place where they would 

see the token of inhabitants; and they were in great perplexity 

also for fear of their flock of goats, which, if they should be 

destroyed, would have been little less than starving them.  So the 

first thing they resolved upon was to despatch three men away 

before it was light, two Spaniards and one Englishman, to drive 

away all the goats to the great valley where the cave was, and, if 

need were, to drive them into the very cave itself.  Could they 

have seen the savages all together in one body, and at a distance 

from their canoes, they were resolved, if there had been a hundred 

of them, to attack them; but that could not be done, for they were 

some of them two miles off from the other, and, as it appeared 

afterwards, were of two different nations.



After having mused a great while on the course they should take, 

they resolved at last, while it was still dark, to send the old 

savage, Friday's father, out as a spy, to learn, if possible, 

something concerning them, as what they came for, what they 

intended to do, and the like.  The old man readily undertook it; 

and stripping himself quite naked, as most of the savages were, 

away he went.  After he had been gone an hour or two, he brings 

word that he had been among them undiscovered, that he found they 

were two parties, and of two several nations, who had war with one 

another, and had a great battle in their own country; and that both 

sides having had several prisoners taken in the fight, they were, 

by mere chance, landed all on the same island, for the devouring 

their prisoners and making merry; but their coming so by chance to 

the same place had spoiled all their mirth - that they were in a 

great rage at one another, and were so near that he believed they 

would fight again as soon as daylight began to appear; but he did 

not perceive that they had any notion of anybody being on the 

island but themselves.  He had hardly made an end of telling his 

story, when they could perceive, by the unusual noise they made, 

that the two little armies were engaged in a bloody fight.  

Friday's father used all the arguments he could to persuade our 

people to lie close, and not be seen; he told them their safety 

consisted in it, and that they had nothing to do but lie still, and 

the savages would kill one another to their hands, and then the 

rest would go away; and it was so to a tittle.  But it was 

impossible to prevail, especially upon the Englishmen; their 

curiosity was so importunate that they must run out and see the 

battle.  However, they used some caution too:  they did not go 

openly, just by their own dwelling, but went farther into the 

woods, and placed themselves to advantage, where they might 

securely see them manage the fight, and, as they thought, not be 

seen by them; but the savages did see them, as we shall find 

hereafter.



The battle was very fierce, and, if I might believe the Englishmen, 

one of them said he could perceive that some of them were men of 

great bravery, of invincible spirit, and of great policy in guiding 

the fight.  The battle, they said, held two hours before they could 

guess which party would be beaten; but then that party which was 

nearest our people's habitation began to appear weakest, and after 

some time more some of them began to fly; and this put our men 

again into a great consternation, lest any one of those that fled 

should run into the grove before their dwelling for shelter, and 

thereby involuntarily discover the place; and that, by consequence, 

the pursuers would also do the like in search of them.  Upon this, 

they resolved that they would stand armed within the wall, and 

whoever came into the grove, they resolved to sally out over the 

wall and kill them, so that, if possible, not one should return to 

give an account of it; they ordered also that it should be done 

with their swords, or by knocking them down with the stocks of 

their muskets, but not by shooting them, for fear of raising an 

alarm by the noise.



As they expected it fell out; three of the routed army fled for 

life, and crossing the creek, ran directly into the place, not in 

the least knowing whither they went, but running as into a thick 

wood for shelter.  The scout they kept to look abroad gave notice 

of this within, with this comforting addition, that the conquerors 

had not pursued them, or seen which way they were gone; upon this 

the Spanish governor, a man of humanity, would not suffer them to 

kill the three fugitives, but sending three men out by the top of 

the hill, ordered them to go round, come in behind them, and 

surprise and take them prisoners, which was done.  The residue of 

the conquered people fled to their canoes, and got off to sea; the 

victors retired, made no pursuit, or very little, but drawing 

themselves into a body together, gave two great screaming shouts, 

most likely by way of triumph, and so the fight ended; the same 

day, about three o'clock in the afternoon, they also marched to 

their canoes.  And thus the Spaniards had the island again free to 

themselves, their fright was over, and they saw no savages for 

several years after.



After they were all gone, the Spaniards came out of their den, and 

viewing the field of battle, they found about two-and-thirty men 

dead on the spot; some were killed with long arrows, which were 

found sticking in their bodies; but most of them were killed with 

great wooden swords, sixteen or seventeen of which they found in 

the field of battle, and as many bows, with a great many arrows.  

These swords were strange, unwieldy things, and they must be very 

strong men that used them; most of those that were killed with them 

had their heads smashed to pieces, as we may say, or, as we call it 

in English, their brains knocked out, and several their arms and 

legs broken; so that it is evident they fight with inexpressible 

rage and fury.  We found not one man that was not stone dead; for 

either they stay by their enemy till they have killed him, or they 

carry all the wounded men that are not quite dead away with them.



This deliverance tamed our ill-disposed Englishmen for a great 

while; the sight had filled them with horror, and the consequences 

appeared terrible to the last degree, especially upon supposing 

that some time or other they should fall into the hands of those 

creatures, who would not only kill them as enemies, but for food, 

as we kill our cattle; and they professed to me that the thoughts 

of being eaten up like beef and mutton, though it was supposed it 

was not to be till they were dead, had something in it so horrible 

that it nauseated their very stomachs, made them sick when they 

thought of it, and filled their minds with such unusual terror, 

that they were not themselves for some weeks after.  This, as I 

said, tamed even the three English brutes I have been speaking of; 

and for a great while after they were tractable, and went about the 

common business of the whole society well enough - planted, sowed, 

reaped, and began to be all naturalised to the country.  But some 

time after this they fell into such simple measures again as 

brought them into a great deal of trouble.



They had taken three prisoners, as I observed; and these three 

being stout young fellows, they made them servants, and taught them 

to work for them, and as slaves they did well enough; but they did 

not take their measures as I did by my man Friday, viz. to begin 

with them upon the principle of having saved their lives, and then 

instruct them in the rational principles of life; much less did 

they think of teaching them religion, or attempt civilising and 

reducing them by kind usage and affectionate arguments.  As they 

gave them their food every day, so they gave them their work too, 

and kept them fully employed in drudgery enough; but they failed in 

this by it, that they never had them to assist them and fight for 

them as I had my man Friday, who was as true to me as the very 

flesh upon my bones.



But to come to the family part.  Being all now good friends - for 

common danger, as I said above, had effectually reconciled them - 

they began to consider their general circumstances; and the first 

thing that came under consideration was whether, seeing the savages 

particularly haunted that side of the island, and that there were 

more remote and retired parts of it equally adapted to their way of 

living, and manifestly to their advantage, they should not rather 

move their habitation, and plant in some more proper place for 

their safety, and especially for the security of their cattle and 

corn.



Upon this, after long debate, it was concluded that they would not 

remove their habitation; because that, some time or other, they 

thought they might hear from their governor again, meaning me; and 

if I should send any one to seek them, I should be sure to direct 

them to that side, where, if they should find the place demolished, 

they would conclude the savages had killed us all, and we were 

gone, and so our supply would go too.  But as to their corn and 

cattle, they agreed to remove them into the valley where my cave 

was, where the land was as proper for both, and where indeed there 

was land enough.  However, upon second thoughts they altered one 

part of their resolution too, and resolved only to remove part of 

their cattle thither, and part of their corn there; so that if one 

part was destroyed the other might be saved.  And one part of 

prudence they luckily used:  they never trusted those three savages 

which they had taken prisoners with knowing anything of the 

plantation they had made in that valley, or of any cattle they had 

there, much less of the cave at that place, which they kept, in 

case of necessity, as a safe retreat; and thither they carried also 

the two barrels of powder which I had sent them at my coming away.  

They resolved, however, not to change their habitation; yet, as I 

had carefully covered it first with a wall or fortification, and 

then with a grove of trees, and as they were now fully convinced 

their safety consisted entirely in their being concealed, they set 

to work to cover and conceal the place yet more effectually than 

before.  For this purpose, as I planted trees, or rather thrust in 

stakes, which in time all grew up to be trees, for some good 

distance before the entrance into my apartments, they went on in 

the same manner, and filled up the rest of that whole space of 

ground from the trees I had set quite down to the side of the 

creek, where I landed my floats, and even into the very ooze where 

the tide flowed, not so much as leaving any place to land, or any 

sign that there had been any landing thereabouts:  these stakes 

also being of a wood very forward to grow, they took care to have 

them generally much larger and taller than those which I had 

planted.  As they grew apace, they planted them so very thick and 

close together, that when they had been three or four years grown 

there was no piercing with the eye any considerable way into the 

plantation.  As for that part which I had planted, the trees were 

grown as thick as a man's thigh, and among them they had placed so 

many other short ones, and so thick, that it stood like a palisado 

a quarter of a mile thick, and it was next to impossible to 

penetrate it, for a little dog could hardly get between the trees, 

they stood so close.



But this was not all; for they did the same by all the ground to 

the right hand and to the left, and round even to the side of the 

hill, leaving no way, not so much as for themselves, to come out 

but by the ladder placed up to the side of the hill, and then 

lifted up, and placed again from the first stage up to the top:  so 

that when the ladder was taken down, nothing but what had wings or 

witchcraft to assist it could come at them.  This was excellently 

well contrived:  nor was it less than what they afterwards found 

occasion for, which served to convince me, that as human prudence 

has the authority of Providence to justify it, so it has doubtless 

the direction of Providence to set it to work; and if we listened 

carefully to the voice of it, I am persuaded we might prevent many 

of the disasters which our lives are now, by our own negligence, 

subjected to.



They lived two years after this in perfect retirement, and had no 

more visits from the savages.  They had, indeed, an alarm given 

them one morning, which put them into a great consternation; for 

some of the Spaniards being out early one morning on the west side 

or end of the island (which was that end where I never went, for 

fear of being discovered), they were surprised with seeing about 

twenty canoes of Indians just coming on shore.  They made the best 

of their way home in hurry enough; and giving the alarm to their 

comrades, they kept close all that day and the next, going out only 

at night to make their observation:  but they had the good luck to 

be undiscovered, for wherever the savages went, they did not land 

that time on the island, but pursued some other design.
