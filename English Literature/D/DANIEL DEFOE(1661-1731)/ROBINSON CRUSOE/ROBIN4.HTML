<P>I had Tortoise or Turtles enough; but now and then one, was as much
as I could put to any use. I had Timber enough to have built a Fleet of
Ships. I had Grapes enough to have made Wine, or to have cur'd into Raisins,
to have loaded that Fleet, when they had been built. But all I could make
use of, was, All that was valuable. I had enough to eat, and to supply
my Wants, and, what was all the rest to me? If I kill'd more Flesh than
I could eat, the Dog must eat it, or the Vermin. If I sow'd more Corn than
I could eat, it must be spoil'd. The Trees that I cut down, were lying
to rot on the Ground. I could make no more use of them than for Fewel;
and that I had no Occasion for, but to dress my Food.

<P>In a Word, The Nature and Experience of Things dictated to me upon just
Reflection, That all the good Things of this World, are no farther good
to us, than they are for our Use; and that whatever we may heap up indeed
to give others, we enjoy just as much as we can use, and no more. The most
covetous griping Miser in the World would have been cur'd of the Vice of
Covetousness, if he had been in my Case; for I possess'd infinitely more
than I knew what to do with. I had no room for Desire, except it was of
Things which I had not, and they were but Trifles, though indeed of great
Use to me. I had, as I hinted before, a Parcel of Money, as well Gold as
Silver, about thirty six Pounds Sterling: Alas! There the nasty sorry useless
Stuff lay; I had no manner of Business for it; and I often thought with
my self, That I would have given a Handful of it for a Gross of Tobacco-Pipes,
or for a Hand-Mill to grind my Corn; nay, I would have given it all for
Sixpenny-worth of <I>Turnip</I> and <I>Carrot</I> Seed out of England,
or for a Handful of Pease and Beans, and a Bottle of Ink: <I>As it was</I>,
I had not the least advantage by it, or Benefit from it; but there it lay
in a Drawer, and grew mouldy with the Damp of the Cave, in the wet Season;
and if I had had the Drawer full of Diamonds, it had been the same Case;
and they had been of no manner of Value to me, because of no Use.

<P>I had now brought my State of Life to be much easier in it self than
it was at first, and much easier to my Mind, as well as to my Body. I frequently
sat down to my Meat with Thankfulness, and admir'd the Hand of God's Providence,
which had thus spread my Table in the Wilderness. I learn'd to look more
upon the bright Side of my Condition, and less upon the dark Side; and
to consider what I enjoy'd, rather than what I wanted; and this gave me
sometimes such secret Comforts, that I cannot express them; and which I
take Notice of here, to put those discontented People in Mind of it, who
cannot enjoy comfortably what God has given them; because they see, and
covet something that he has not given them: All our Discontents about what
we want, appear'd to me, to spring from the Want of Thankfulness for what
we have.

<P>Another Reflection was of great Use to me, and doubtless would be so
to any one that should fall into such Distress as mine was; and this was,
To compare my present Condition with what I at first expected it should
be; nay, with what it would certainly have been, if the good Providence
of God had not wonderfully order'd the Ship to be cast up nearer to the
Shore, where I not only Could come at her, but could bring what I got out
of her to the Shore, for my Relief and Comfort; without which, I had wanted
for Tools to work, Weapons for Defence, or Gun-Powder and Shot for getting
my Food.

<P>I spent whole Hours, I may say whole Days, in representing to my self
in the most lively Colours, how I must have acted, if I had got nothing
out of the Ship. How I could not have so much as got any Food, except Fish
and Turtles; and that as it was long before I found any of them, I must
have perish'd first. That I should have liv'd, if I had not perish'd, like
a meer Savage. That if I had kill'd a Goat, or a Fowl, by any Contrivance,
I had no way to flea' or open them, or part the Flesh from the Skin, and
the Bowels, or to cut it up; but must gnaw it with my Teeth, and pull it
with my Claws like a Beast.

<P>These Reflections made me very sensible of the Goodness of Providence
to me, and very thankful for my present Condition, with all its Hardships
and Misfortunes: And this Part also I cannot but recommend to the Reflection
of those, who are apt in their Misery to say, <I>Is any Affliction like
mine!</I> Let them consider, How much worse the Cases of some People are,
and their Case might have been, if Providence had thought fit.

<P>I had another Reflection which assisted me also to comfort my Mind with
Hopes; and this was, comparing my present Condition with what I had deserv'd,
and had therefore Reason to expect from the Hand of Providence. I had liv'd
a dreadful Life, perfectly destitute of the Knowledge and Fear of God.
I had been well instructed by Father and Mother; neither had they been
wanting to me, in their early Endeavours, to infuse a religious Awe of
God into my Mind, a Sense of my Duty, and of what the Nature and End of
my Being, requir'd of me. But alas! falling early into the Seafaring Life,
which of all the Lives is the most destitute of the Fear of God, though
his Terrors are always before them; I say, falling early into the Seafaring
Life, and into Seafaring Company, all that little Sense of Religion which
I had entertain'd, was laugh'd out of me by my Mess-Mates, by a harden'd
despising of Dangers; and the Views of Death, which grew habitual to me;
by my long Absence from all Manner of Opportunities to converse with any
thing but what was like my self, or to hear any thing that was good, or
tended towards it.

<P>So void was I of every Thing that was good, or of the least Sense of
what I was, or was to be, that in the greatest Deliverances I enjoy'd,
such as my Escape from <I>Sallee</I>; my being taken up by the <I>Portuguese</I>
Master of the Ship; my being planted so well in the <I>Brasils</I>; my
receiving the Cargo from <I>England</I>, and the like; I never had once
the Word Thank God, so much as on my Mind, or in my Mouth; nor in the greatest
Distress, had I so much as a Thought to pray to him, or so much as to say,
<I>Lord have Mercy upon me;</I>no nor to mention the Name of God, unless
it was to swear by, and blaspheme it.

<P>I had terrible Reflections upon my Mind for many Months, as I have already
observ'd, on the Account of my wicked and hardned Life past; and when I
look'd about me and considered what particular Providences had attended
me since my coming into this Place, and how God had dealt bountifully with
me; had not only punished me less than my Iniquity had deserv'd, but had
so plentifully provided for me; this gave me great hopes that my Repentance
was accepted, and that God had yet Mercy in store for me.

<P>With these Reflections I work'd my Mind up, not only to Resignation
to the Will of God in the present Disposition of my Circumstances; but
even to a sincere Thankfulness for my Condition, and that I who was yet
a living Man, ought not to complain, seeing I had not the due Punishment
of my Sins; that I enjoy'd so many Mercies which I had no reason to have
expected in that Place; that I ought never more to repine at my Condition
but to rejoyce, and to give daily Thanks for that daily Bread, which nothing
but a Croud of Wonders could have brought. That I ought to consider I had
been fed even by Miracle, even as great as that of feeding Elijah by Ravens;
nay, by a long Series of Miracles, and that I could hardly have nam'd a
Place in the unhabitable Part of the World where I could have been cast
more to my Advantage: A Place, where as I had no Society, which was my
Affliction on one Hand, so I found no ravenous Beast, no furious Wolves
or Tygers to threaten my Life, no venomous Creatures or poisonous, which
I might feed On to my Hurt, no Savages to murther and devour me.

<P>In a word, as my Life was a Life of Sorrow, one way, so it was a Life
of Mercy, another; and I wanted nothing to make it a Life of Comfort, but
to be able to make my Sence of God's Goodness to me, and Care over me in
this Condition, be my daily Consolation; and after I did make a just Improvement
of these things, I went away and was no more sad.

<P>I had now been here so long, that many Things which I brought on Shore
for my Help, were either quite gone, or very much wasted' and near spent.

<P>My Ink, as I observed, had been gone some time, all but a very little,
which I eek'd out with Water a little and a little, till it was so pale
it scarce left any Appearance of black upon the Paper: As long as it lasted,
I made use of it to minute down the Days of the Month on which any remarkable
Thing happen'd to me, and first by casting up Times past: I remember that
there was a strange Concurrence of Days, in the various Providences which
befel me; and which, if I had been superstitiously inclin'd to observe
Days as Fatal or Fortunate, I might have had Reason to have look'd upon
with a great deal of Curiosity.

<P>First I had observed, that the same Day that I broke away from my Father
and my Friends, and run away to Hull, in order to go to Sea; the same Day
afterwards I was taken by the Sallee Man of War, and made a Slave.

<P>The same Day of the Year that I escaped out of the Wreck of that Ship
in Yarmouth Rodes, that same Day-Year afterwards I made my escape from
Sallee in the Boat.

<P>The same Day of the Year I was born on (viz.) the 30th of <I>September</I>,
that same Day, I had my Life so miraculously saved 26 Year after, when
I was cast on Shore in this Island, so that my wicked Life, and my solitary
Life begun both on a Day.

<P>The next Thing to my Ink's being wasted, was that of my Bread, I mean
the Bisket which I brought out of the Ship; this I had husbanded to the
last degree, allowing my self but one Cake of Bread a Day for above a Year,
and yet I was quite without Bread for near a Year before I got any Corn
of my own, and great Reason I had to be thankful that I had any at all,
the getting it being, as has been already observed, next to miraculous.

<P>My Cloaths began to decay too mightily: As to Linnen, I had had none
a good while, except some chequer'd Shirts which I found in the Chests
of the other Seamen, and which I carefully preserved, because many times
I could bear no other Cloaths on but a Shirt; and it was a very great help
to me that I had among all the Men's Cloaths Of the Ship almost three dozen
Of Shirts. There were also several thick Watch Coats of the Seamens, which
were left indeed, but they were too hot to wear; and tho' it is true, that
the Weather was so violent hot, that there was no need of Cloaths, yet
I could not go quite naked; no, tho' I had been inclin'd to it, which I
was not, nor could not abide the thoughts of it, tho' I was all alone.

<P>The Reason why I could not go quite naked, was, I could not bear the
heat of the Sun so well when quite naked, as with some Cloaths on; nay,
the very Heat frequently blistered my Skin; whereas with a Shirt on, the
Air itself made some Motion, and whistling under that Shirt was twofold
cooler than without it; no more could I ever bring my self to go out in
the heat of Sun, without a Cap or a Hat; the heat of the Sun beating with
such Violence as it does in that Place, would give me the Head-ach presently,
by darting so directly on my Head, without a Cap or Hat on, so that I could
not bear it, whereas, if I put on my Hat, it would presently go away.

<P>Upon those Views I began to consider about putting the few Rags I had,
which I call'd Cloaths, into some Order; I had worn out all the Wast-coats
I had, and my Business was now to try if I could not make Jackets out of
the great Watch-Coats which I had by me, and with such other Materials
as I had, so I set to Work a Taylering, or rather indeed a Botching, for
I made most piteous Work of it. However, I made shift to make two or three
new Wastcoats, which I hoped wou'd serve me a great while; as for Breeches
or Drawers, I made but a very sorry shift indeed, till afterward.

<P>I have mentioned that I saved the Skins of all the Creatures that I
kill'd, I mean four-footed ones, and I had hung them up stretch'd out with
Sticks in the Sun, by which means some of them were so dry and hard that
they were fit for little but others it seems were very useful. The first
thing I made of these was a great Cap for my Head, with the Hair on the
out Side to shoor off the Rain; and this I perform'd so well, that after
this I made me a Suit of Cloaths wholly of these Skins, that is to say,
a Wastcoat, and Breeches open at Knees, and both loose, for they were rather
wanting to keep me cool than to keep me warm. I must not omit to acknowledge
that they were wretchedly made; for if I was a bad <I>Carpenter</I>, I
was a worse Tayler. However, they were such as I made very good shift with;
and when I was abroad, if it happen'd to rain, the Hair of my Wastcoat
and Cap being outermost, I was kept very dry.

<P>After this I spent a great deal of Time and Pains to make me an Umbrella;
I was indeed in great want of one, and had a great Mind to make one; I
had seen them made in the <I>Brasils</I>, where they are very useful in
the great Heats which are there. And I felt the Heats every jot as great
here, and greater too, being nearer the Equinox; besides, as I was oblig'd
to be much abroad, it was a most useful thing to me, as well for the Rains
as the Heats. I took a world of Pains at it, and was a great while before
I could make any thing likely to hold; nay, after I thought I had hit the
Way, I spoil'd 2 or 3 before I made one to my Mind; but at last I made
one that answer'd indifferently well: The main Difficulty I found was to
make it to let down. I could make it to spread, but if it did not let down
too, and draw in, it was not portable for me any Way but just over my Head,
which wou'd not do. However, at last, as I said, I made one to answer,
and covered it with Skins, the Hair upwards, So that it cast off the Rains
like a Penthouse, and kept off the Sun so effectually, that I could walk
out in the hottest of the Weather with greater Advantage than I could before
in the coolest, and when I had no need of it, cou'd close it and carry
it under my Arm.

<P>Thus I liv'd mighty comfortably, my Mind being entirely composed by
resigning to the Will of God, and throwing my self wholly upon the Disposal
of his Providence. This made my Life better than sociable, for when I began
to regret the want of Conversation, I would ask my self whether thus conversing
mutually with my own Thoughts, and, as I hope I may say, with even God
himself by Ejaculations, was not better than the utmost Enjoyment of humane
Society in the World.

<P>I cannot say that after this, for five Years, any extraordinary thing
happened to me, but I liv'd on in the same Course, in the same Posture
and Place, just as before; the chief things I was employ'd in, besides
my yearly Labour of planting my Barley and Rice, and curing my Raisins,
of both which I always kept up just enough to have sufficient Stock of
one Year's Provisions beforehand. I say, besides this yearly Labour, and
my daily Labour of going out with my Gun, I had one Labour to make me a
Canoe, which at last I finished. So that by digging a Canal to it of six
Foot wide, and four Foot deep, I brought it into the Creek, almost half
a Mile. As for the first, which was so vastly big, as I made it without
considering before-hand, as I ought to do, how I should be able to launch
it; so never being able to bring it to the Water, or bring the Water to
it, I was oblig'd to let it lye where it was, as a Memorandum to teach
me to be wiser next Time: Indeed, the next Time, tho' I could not get a
Tree proper for it, and in a Place where I could not get the Water to it,
at any less Distance, than as I have said, near half a Mile; yet as I saw
it was practicable at last, I never gave it over: and though I was near
two Years about it, yet I never grutch'd my Labour, in Hopes of having
a Boat to go off to Sea at last.

<P>However, though my little <I>Periagua</I> was finish'd; yet the Size
of it was not at all answerable to the Design which I had in View, when
I made the first; I mean, Of venturing over to the <I>Terra Firma</I>,
where it was above forty Miles broad; accordingly, the Smallness of my
Boat assisted to put an End to that Design, and now I thought no more of
it: But as I had a Boat, my next Design was to make a Tour round the Island;
for as I had been on the other Side, in one Place, crossing as I have already
describ'd it, over the Land; so the Discoveries I made in that little Journey,
made me very eager to see other Parts of the Coast; and now I had a Boat,
I thought of nothing but sailing round the Island.

<P>For this Purpose, that I might do every Thing with Discretion and Consideration,
I fitted up a little Mast to my Boat, and made a Sail to it, out of some
of the Pieces of the Ship's Sail, which lay in store; and of which I had
a great Stock by me.

<P>Having fitted my Mast and Sail, and try'd the Boat, I found she would
sail very well: Then I made little Lockers, or Boxes, at either End of
my Boat, to put Provisions, Necessaries and Ammunition, etc. into, to be
kept dry, either from Rain, or the Sprye of the Sea; and a little long
hollow Place I cut in the In-side of the Boat, where I could lay Gun, making
a Flap to hang down over it to keep it dry.

<P>I fix'd my Umbrella also in a Step at the Stern, like a Mast, to stand
over my Head, and keep the Heat of the Sun off of me like an Auning; and
thus I every now and then took a little Voyage upon the Sea, but never
went far out, nor far from the little Creek; but at last being eager to
view the Circumference of my little Kingdom, I resolv'd upon my our, and
accordingly I victuall'd my Ship for the Voyage, putting in two Dozen of
my Loaves (Cakes I should rather All them) of Barley Bread, an Earthen
Pot full of parch'd Rice, a Food I eat a great deal of, a little Bottle
of Rum, half a Goat, and Powder and Shot for killing more, and two large
Watch-coats, of those which, as I mention'd before, I had sav'd out of
the Seamen's Chests; these I took, one to lye upon, and the other to cover
me in the Night.

<P>It was the sixth of <I>November</I>, in the sixth Year of my Reign,
or my Captivity, which you please, That I set out on this Voyage, and I
found it much longer than I expected; for though the Island it self was
not very large, yet when I me to the <I>East</I> Side of it, I found a
great Ledge of Rocks lye out above two Leagues into the Sea, some above
Water, some under it; and beyond that, a Shoal of Sand, lying dry half
a League more; so that I was oblig'd to go a great Way out to Sea to double
the Point.

<P>When first I discover'd them, I was going to give over my Enterprise,
and come back again, not knowing how far it might oblige me to go out to
Sea; and above all, doubting how I should get back again; so I came to
an Anchor; for I had made me a kind of an Anchor with a Piece of a broken
Graplin, which I got out of the Ship.

<P>Having secur'd my Boat, I took my Gun, and went on Shore, climbing up
upon a Hill, which seem'd to over-look that Point, where I saw the full
Extent of it, and resolv'd to venture.

<P>In my viewing the Sea from that Hill where I stood, I perceiv'd a strong,
and indeed, a most furious Current, which run to the <I>East</I>, and even
came close to the Point; and I took the more Notice of it, because I saw
there might be some Danger; that when I came into it, I might be carry'd
out to Sea by the Strength of it, and not be able to make the Island again;
and indeed, had I not gotten first up upon this Hill, 1 believe it would
have been so; for there was the same Current on the other Side the Island,
only, that it set off at a farther Distance; and I saw there was a strong
Eddy under the Shore; so I had nothing to do but to get in out of the first
Current, and I should presently be in an Eddy.

<P>I lay here, however, two Days; because the Wind blowing pretty fresh
at <I>E.S.E.</I> and that being just contrary to the said Current, made
a great Breach of the Sea upon the Point; so that it was not safe for me
to keep too close to the Shore for the Breach, nor to go too far off because
of the Stream.

<P>The third Day in the Morning, the Wind having abated over Night, the
Sea was calm, and I ventur'd; but I am a warning Piece again, to all rash
and ignorant Pilots; for no sooner was I come to the Point, when even I
was not my Boat's Length from the Shore, but I found my self in a great
Depth of Water, and a Current like the Sluice of a Mill: It carry'd my
Boat a long with it with such Violence, That all I could do, could not
keep her so much as on the Edge of it; but I found it hurry'd me farther
and farther out from the Eddy, which was on my left Hand. There was no
Wind stirring to help me, and all I could do with my Paddlers signify'd
nothing, and now I began to give my self over for lost; for as the Current
was on both Sides the Island, I knew in a few Leagues Distance they must
joyn again, and then I was irrecoverably gone; nor did I see any Possibility
of avoiding it; so that I had no Prospect before me but of Perishing; not
by the Sea, for that was calm enough, but of starving for Hunger. I had
indeed found a Tortoise on the Shore, as big almost as I could lift, and
had toss'd it into the Boat; and I had a great Jar of fresh Water, that
is to say, one of my Earthen Pots; but what was all this to being driven
into the vast Ocean, where to be sure, there was no Shore, no main Land,
or Island, for a thousand Leagues at least.

<P>And now I saw how easy it was for the Providence of God make the most
miserable Condition Mankind could be in <I>worse</I>. Now I look'd back
upon my desolate solitary Island, the most pleasant Place in the World,
and all the Happiness my Heart could wish for, was to be but there again.
I stretch'd out my Hands to it with eager Wishes. O happy Desart said I,
I shall never see thee more. O miserable Creature, said I, whether am I
going: Then I reproach'd my Self with my unthankful Temper, and how I had
repin'd at my solitary Condition; and now what would I give to be on Shore
there again. Thus we never see the true State of our Condition, till it
is illustrated to us by its Contraries; nor know how to value what we enjoy,
but by the want of it. It is scarce possible to imagine the Consternation
I was now in, being driven from my beloved Island (for so it appear'd to
me now to be) into the wide Ocean, almost two Leagues, and in the utmost
Despair of ever recovering it again. However, I work'd hard, till indeed
my Strength was almost exhausted, and kept my Boat as much to the <I>Northward</I>,
that is, towards the Side of the Current which the Eddy lay on, as possibly
I could; when about Noon, as the Sun pass'd the Meridian, I thought I felt
a little Breeze of Wind in my Face, springing up from the <I>S.S.E.</I>
This chear'd my Heart a little, and especially when in about half an Hour
more, it blew a pretty small gentle Gale. By this Time I was gotten at
a frightful Distance from the Island, and had the least Cloud or haizy
Weather interven'd, I had been undone another Way too; for I had no Compass
on Board, and should never have known how to have steer'd towards the Island,
if I had but once lost Sight of it; but the Weather continuing clear, I
apply'd my self to get up my Mast again, spread my Sail, standing away
to the <I>North</I>, as much as possible, to get out of the Current.

<P>Just as I had set my Mast and Sail, and the Boat began to stretch away,
I saw even by the Clearness of the Water, some Alteration of the Current
was near; for where the Current was so strong, the Water was foul; but
perceiving the Water clear, I found the Current abate, and presently I
found to the <I>East</I>, at about half a Mile, a Breach of the Sea upon
some Rocks; these Rocks I found caus'd the Current to part again, and as
the main Stress of it ran away more <I>Southerly</I>, leaving the Rocks
to the <I>North-East</I>; so the other return'd by the Repulse of the Rocks,
and made a strong Eddy, which run back again to the <I>North-West</I>,
with a very sharp Stream.

<P>They who know what it is to have a Reprieve brought to them upon the
Ladder, or to be rescued from Thieves just a going to murther them, or,
who have been in such like Extremities, may guess what my present Surprise
of Joy was, and how gladly I put my Boat into the Stream of this Eddy,
and the Wind also freshening, how gladly I spread my Sail to it, running
chearfully before the Wind, and with a strong Tide or Eddy under Foot.

<P>This Eddy carryed me about a League in my Way back again directly towards
the Island, but about two Leagues more to the Northward than the Current
which carried me away at first; so that when I came near the Island, I
found my self open to the Northern Shore of it, that is to say, the other
End of the Island opposite to that which I went out from.

<P>When I had made something more than a League of Way by the help of this
Current or Eddy, I found it was spent and serv'd me no farther. However,
I found that being between the two great Currents, (<I>viz</I>.) that on
the South Side which had hurried me away, and that on the North which lay
about a League on the other Side. I say between these two, in the wake
of the Island, I found the Water at least still and running no Way, and
having still a Breeze of Wind fair for me, I kept on steering directly
for the Island, tho' not making such fresh Way as I did before.

<P>About four a-Clock in the Evening, being then within about a League
of the Island, I found the Point of the Rocks which occasioned this Disaster,
stretching out as is describ'd before to the Southward, and casting off
the Current more Southwardly, had of Course made another Eddy to the North,
and this I found very strong, but not directly setting the Way my Course
lay which was due West, but almost full North. However having a fresh Gale,
I stretch'd a-cross this Eddy slanting North-west, and in about an Hour
came within about a Mile of the Shore, where it being smooth Water, I soon
got to Land.

<P>When I was on Shore I fell on my Knees and gave God Thanks for my Deliverance,
resolving to lay aside all Thoughts of my Deliverance by my Boat, and refreshing
my self with such Things as I had, I brought my Boat close to the Shore
in a little Cove that I had spy'd under some Trees, and lay'd me down to
sleep, being quite spent with the Labour and Fatigue of the Voyage.

<P>I was now at a great Loss which Way to get Home with my Boat, I had
run so much Hazard, and knew too much the Case to think of attempting it
by the Way I went out, and what might be at the other Side (I mean the
West Side) I knew not, nor had I any Mind to run any more Ventures; so
I only resolved in the Morning to make my Way Westward along the Shore
and to see if there was no Creek where I might lay up my Frigate in Safety,
so as to have her again if I wanted her; in about three Mile or thereabout
coasting the Shore, I came to a very good Inlet or Bay about a Mile over,
which narrowed till it came to a very little Rivulet or Brook, where I
found a very convenient Harbour for my Boat and where she lay as if she
had been in a little Dock made on Purpose for her. Here I put in, and having
stow'd my Boat very safe, I went on Shore to look about me and see where
I was.

<P>I soon found I had but a little past by the Place where I had been before,
when I travell'd on Foot to that Shore; so taking nothing out of my Boat,
but my Gun and my Umbrella, for it was exceeding hot, I began my March:
The Way was comfortable enough after such a Voyage as I had been upon,
and I reach'd my old Bower in the Evening, where I found every thing standing
as I left it; for I always kept it in good Order, being, as I said before,
my Country House.

<P>I got over the Fence, and laid me down in the Shade to rest my Limbs;
for I was very weary, and fell asleep: But judge you, if you can, that
read my Story, what a Surprize I must be in, when I was wak'd out of my
Sleep by a Voice calling me by my Name several times, <I>Robin, Robin,
Robin Crusoe</I>, poor <I>Robin Crusoe</I>, where are you <I>Robin Crusoe</I>?
Where are you? Where have you been?

<P>I was so dead asleep at first, being fatigu'd with Rowing, or Paddling,
as it is call'd, the first Part of the Day, and with walking the latter
Part, that I did not wake thoroughly, but dozing between sleeping and waking,
thought I dream'd that some Body spoke to me: But as the Voice continu'd
to repeat <I>Robin Crusoe, Robin Crusoe</I>, at last I began to wake more
perfectly, and was at first dreadfully frighted, and started up in the
utmost Consternation: But no sooner were my Eyes open, but I saw my <I>Poll</I>
sitting on the Top of the Hedge; and immediately knew that it was he that
spoke to me; for just in such bemoaning Language I had used to talk to
him, and teach him; and he had learn'd it so perfectly, that he would sit
upon my Finger, and lay his Bill close to my Face, and cry, Poor Robin
Crusoe, <I>Where are you? Where have you been? How come you here</I>? And
such things as I had taught him.

<P>However, even though I knew it was the Parrot, and that indeed it could
be no Body else, it was a good while before I could compose my self: First,
I was amazed how the Creature got thither, and then, how he should just
keep about the Place, and no where else: But as I was well satisfied it
could be no Body but honest <I>Poll</I>, I got it over; and holding out
my Hand, and calling him by his Name <I>Poll</I>, the sociable Creature
came to me, and sat upon my Thumb, as he used to do, and continu'd talking
to me, <I>Poor</I> Robin Crusoe, and <I>how did I come here</I>? and <I>where
had I been</I>? just as if he had been overjoy'd to see me again; and so
I carry'd him Home along with me.

<P>I had now had enough of rambling to Sea for some time, and had enough
to do for many Days to sit still, and reflect upon the Danger I had been
in: I would have been very glad to have had my Boat again on my Side of
the Island; but I knew not how it was practicable to get it about as to
the East Side of the Island, which I had gone round; I knew well enough
there was no venturing that Way; my very heart would shrink, and my very
Blood run chill but to think of it: And as to the other Side of the Island,
I did not know how it might be there; but supposing the Current ran with
the same Force against the Shore at the East as it pass'd by it on the
other, I might run the same Risk of being driven down the Stream, and carry'd
by the Island, as I had been before, of being carry'd away from it; so
with these Thoughts I contented my self to be without any Boat, though
it had been the Product of so many Months Labour to make it, and of so
many more to get it unto the Sea.

<P>In this Government of my Temper, I remain'd near a Year, liv'd a very
sedate retir'd Life, as you may well suppose; and my Thoughts being very
much composed as to my Condition, and fully comforted in resigning my self
to the Dispositions of Providence, I thought I liv'd really very happily
in all things, except that of Society.

<P>I improv'd my self in this time in all the mechanick Exercises which
my Necessities put me upon applying my self to, and I believe cou'd, upon
Occasion, make a very good Carpenter, especially considering how few Tools
I had.

<P>Besides this, I arriv'd at an unexpected Perfection in my Earthen Ware,
and contriv'd well enough to make them with a Wheel, which I found infinitely
easyer and better; because I made things round and shapable, which before
were filthy things indeed to look on. But I think I was never more vain
of my own Performance, or more joyful for any thing I found out, than for
my being able to make a Tobacco-Pipe. And tho' it was a very ugly clumsy
thing, when it was done, and only burnt red like other Earthen Ware, yet
as it was hard and firm, and would draw the Smoke, I was exceedingly comforted
with it, for I had been always used to smoke, and there were Pipes in the
Ship, but I forgot them at first, not knowing that there was Tobacco in
the Island; and afterwards, when I search'd the Ship again, I could not
come at any Pipes at all.

<P>In my Wicker Ware also I improved much, and made abundance of necessary
Baskets, as well as my Invention shew'd me, tho not very handsome, yet
they were such as were very handy and convenient for my laying things up
in, or fetching things home in. For Example, if I kill'd a Goat abroad,
I could hang it up in a Tree, flea it, and dress it, and cut it in Pieces,
and bring it home in a Basket, and the like by a Turtle, I could cut it
up, take out the Eggs, and a Piece or two of the Flesh, which was enough
for me, and bring them home in a Basket, and leave the rest behind me.
Also large deep Baskets were my Receivers for my Corn, which I always rubb'd
out as soon as it was dry, and cured, and kept it in great Baskets.

<P>I began now to perceive my Powder abated considerably, and this was
a Want which it was impossible for me to supply, and I began seriously
to consider what I must do when I should have no more Powder; that is to
say, how I should do to kill any Goat. I had, as is observ'd in the third
Year of my being here, kept a young Kid, and bred her up tame, and I was
in hope of getting a He-Goat, but I could not by any Means bring it to
pass, 'till my Kid grew an old Goat; and I could never find in my Heart
to kill her, till she dy'd at last of meer Age.

<P>But being now in the eleventh Year of my Residence, and, as I have said,
my Ammunition growing low, I set my self to study some Art to trap and
snare the Goats, to see whether I could not catch some of them alive, and
particularly I wanted a She-Goat great with young.

<P>To this Purpose I made Snares to hamper them, and I do believe they
were more than once taken in them, but my Tackle was not good, for I had
no Wire, and I always found them broken, and my Bait devoured.

<P>At length I resolv'd to try a Pit-fall, so I dug several large Pits
in the Earth, in Places where I had observ'd the Goats used to feed, and
over these Pits I plac'd Hurdles of my own baking too, with a great Weight
upon them; and several times I put Ears of Barley, and dry Rice, without
setting the Trap, and I could easily perceive that the Goats had gone in
and eaten up the Corn, for I could see the Mark of their Feet. At length
I set three Traps in one Night, and going the next Morning I found them
all standing, and yet the Bait eaten and gone: This was very discouraging.
However, I alter'd my Trap, and, not to trouble you with Particulars, going
one Morning to see my Trap, I found in one of them a large old He-Goat,
and in one of the other, three Kids, a Male and two Females.

<P>As to the old one, I knew not what to do with him, he was so fierce
I durst not go into the Pit to him; that is to say, to go about to bring
him away alive, which was what I wanted. I could have kill'd him, but that
was not my Business, nor would it answer my End. So I e'en let him out,
and he ran away as if he had been frighted out of his Wits: But I had forgot
then what I learn'd afterwards, that Hunger will tame a Lyon. If I had
let him stay there three or four Days without Food, and then have carry'd
him some Water to drink, and then a little Corn, he would have been as
tame as one of the Kids, for they are mighty sagacious tractable Creatures
where they are well used.

<P>However, for the present I let him go, knowing no better at that time;
then I went to the three Kids, and taking them one by one, I tyed them
with Strings together, and with some Difficulty brought them all home.

<P>It was a good while before they wou'd feed, but throwing them some sweet
Corn, it tempted them and they began to be tame; and now I found that if
I expected to supply my self with Goat-Flesh when I had no Powder or Shot
left, breeding some up tame was my only way, when perhaps I might have
them about my House like a Flock of Sheep.

<P>But then it presently occurr'd to me, that I must keep the tame from
the wild, or else they would always run wild when they grew up, and the
only Way for this was to have some enclosed Piece of Ground, well fenc'd
either with Hedge or Pale, to keep them in so effectually, that those within
might not break out, or those without break in.

<P>This was a great Undertaking for one Pair of Hands, yet as I saw there
was an absolute Necessity of doing it, my first Piece of Work was to find
out a proper Piece of Ground, <I>viz</I>. where there was likely to be
Herbage for them to eat, Water for them to drink, and Cover to keep them
from the Sun.

<P>Those who understand such Enclosures will think I had very little Contrivance,
when I pitch'd upon a Place very proper for all these, being a plain open
Piece of Meadow-Land, or Savanna, (as our People call it in the Western
Collonies,) which had two or three little Drills' of fresh Water in it,
and at one end was very woody. I say they will smile at my Forecast, when
I shall tell them I began my enclosing of this Piece of Ground in such
a manner, that my Hedge or Pale must have been at least two Mile about.
Nor was the Madness of it so great as to the Compass, for if it was ten
Mile about I was like to have time enough to do it in. But I did not consider
that my Goats would be as wild in so much Compass as if they had had the
whole Island, and I should have so much Room to chace them in, that I should
never catch them.

<P>My Hedge was begun and carry'd on, I believe, about fifty Yards, when
this Thought occurr'd to me, so I presently stopt short, and for the first
beginning I resolv'd to enclose a Piece of about 150 Yards in length, and
100 Yards in breadth, which as it would maintain as many as I should have
in any reasonable time, so as my Flock encreased, I could add more Ground
to my Enclosure.

<P>This was acting with some Prudence, and I went to work with Courage.
I was about three Months hedging in the first Piece, and till I had done
it I tether'd the three Kids in the best part of it, and us'd them to feed
as near me as possible to make them familiar; and very often I would go
and carry them some Ears of Barley, or a handful of Rice, and feed them
out of my Hand; so that after my Enclosure was finished, and I let them
loose, they would follow me up and down, bleating after me for a handful
of Corn.

<P>This answer'd my End, and in about a Year and half I had a Flock of
about twelve Goats, Kids and all; and in two Years more I had three and
forty, besides several that I took and kill'd for my Food. And after that
I enclosed five several Pieces of Ground to feed them in, with little Pens
to drive them into, to take them as I wanted, and Gates out of one Piece
of Ground into another.

<P>But this was not all, for now I not only had Goats Flesh to feed on
when I pleas'd, but Milk too, a thing which indeed in my beginning I did
not so much as think of, and which, when it came into my Thoughts, was
really an agreeable Surprize. For now I set up my Dairy, and had sometimes
a Gallon or two of Milk in a Day. And as Nature, who gives Supplies of
Food to every Creature, dictates even naturally how to make use of it;
so I that had never milk'd a Cow, much less a Goat, or seen Butter or Cheese
made, very readily and handily, tho' after a great many Essays and Miscarriages,
made me both Butter and Cheese at last, and never wanted it afterwards.

<P>How mercifully can our great Creator treat his Creatures, even in those
Conditions in which they seem'd to be overwhelm'd in Destruction. How can
he sweeten the bitterest Providences, and give us Cause to praise him for
Dungeons and Prisons. What a Table was here spread for me in a Wilderness,
where I saw nothing at first but to perish for Hunger.

<P>It would have made a Stoick smile to have seen, me and my little Family
sit down to Dinner; there was my Majesty the Prince and Lord of the whole
island; I had the Lives of all my Subjects at my absolute Command. I could
hang, draw, give Liberty, and take it away, and no Rebels among all my
Subjects.

<P>Then to see how like a King I din'd too all alone, attended by my Servants,
<I>Poll</I>, as if he had been my Favourite, was the only Person permitted
to talk to me. My Dog who was now grown very old and crazy, and had found
no Species to multiply his Kind upon, sat always at my Right Hand, and
two Cats, one on one Side the Table, and one on the other, expecting now
and then a Bit from my Hand, as a Mark of special Favour.

<P>But these were not the two Cats which I brought on Shore at first, for
they were both of them dead, and had been interr'd near my Habitation by
my own Hand; but one of them having multiply'd by I know not what Kind
of Creature, these were two which I had preserv'd tame, whereas the rest
run wild in the Woods, and became indeed troublesom to me at last; for
they would often come into my House, and plunder me too, till at last I
was obliged to shoot them, and did kill a great many; at length they left
me with this Attendance, and in this plentiful Manner I lived; neither
could I be said to want any thing but Society, and of that in some time
after this, I was like to have too much.

<P>I was something impatient, as I have observ'd, to have the Use of my
Boat; though very loath to run any more Hazards; and therefore sometimes
I sat contriving Ways to get her about the Island, and at other Times I
sat my self down contented enough without her. But I had a strange Uneasiness
in my Mind to go down to the Point of the Island, where, as I have said,
in my last Ramble, I went up the Hill to see how the Shore lay, and how
the Current set, that I might see what I had to do: This Inclination encreas'd
upon me every Day, and at length I resolv'd to travel thither by Land,
following the Edge of the Shore. I did so: But had any one in <I>England</I>
been to meet such a Man as I was, it must either have frighted them, or
rais'd a great deal of Laughter; and as I frequently stood still to look
at my self, I could not but smile at the Notion of my travelling though
<I>Yorkshire</I> with such an Equipage, and in such a Dress: Be pleas'd
to take a Scetch of my Figure as follows,

<P>I had a great high shapeless Cap, made of a Goat's Skin, with a Flap
hanging down behind, as well to keep the Sun from me, as to shoot the Rain
off from running into my Neck; nothing being so hurtful in these Climates,
as the Rain upon the Flesh under the Cloaths.

<P>I had a short Jacket of Goat-Skin, the Skirts coming down to about the
middle of my Thighs; and a Pair of open-knee'd Breeches of the same, the
Breeches were made of the Skin of an old <I>He-goat</I>, whose Hair hung
down such a Length on either Side, that like <I>Pantaloons</I> it reach'd
to the middle of my Legs; Stockings and Shoes I had none, but had made
me a Pair of some-things, I scarce know what to call them, like Buskins
to flap over my Legs, and lace on either Side like Spatter-dashes; but
of a most barbarous Shape, as indeed were all the rest of my Cloaths.

<P>I had on a broad Belt of Goats-Skin dry'd, which I drew together with
two Thongs of the same, instead of Buckles, and in a kind of a Frog on
either Side of this. Instead of a Sword and a Dagger, hung a little Saw
and a Hatchet, one on one Side, one on the other. I had another Belt not
so broad, and fasten'd in the same Manner, which hung over my Shoulder;
and at the End of it, under my left Arm, hung two Pouches, both made of
Goat's-Skin too; in one of which hung my Powder, in the other my Shot:
At my Back I carry'd my Basket, on my Shoulder my Gun, and over my Head
a great clumsy ugly Goat-Skin Umbrella, but which, after all, was the most
necessary Thing I had about me, next to my Gun: As for my Face, the Colour
of it was really not so <I>Moletta</I>-like as one might expect from a
Man not at all careful of it, and living within nine or ten Degrees of
the <I>Equinox</I>. My Beard I had once suffer'd to grow till it was about
a Quarter of a Yard long; but as I had both Scissars and Razors sufficient,
I had cut it pretty short, except what grew on my upper Lip, which I had
trimm'd into a large Pair of <I>Mahometan</I> Whiskers, such as I had seen
worn by some Turks, who I saw at Sallee; for the Moors did not wear such,
tho' the Turks did; of these Muschatoes or Whiskers, I will not say they
were long enough to hang my Hat upon them; but they were of a Length and
Shape monstrous enough, and such as in <I>England</I> would have pass'd
for frightful.

<P>But all this is by the by; for as to my Figure, I had so few to observe
me, that it was of no manner of Consequence; so I say no more to that Part.
In this kind of Figure I went my new Journey, and was out five or six Days.
I travell'd first along the Sea Shore, directly to the Place where I first
brought my Boat to an Anchor, to get up upon the Rocks; and having no Boat
now to take care of, I went over the Land a nearer Way to the same Height
that I was upon before, when looking forward to the Point of the Rocks
which lay out, and which I was oblig'd to double with my Boat, as is said
above: I was surpriz'd to see the Sea all smooth and quiet, no Ripling,
no Motion, no Current, any more there than in other Places.

<P>I was at a strange Loss to understand this, and resolv'd to spend some
Time in the observing it, to see if nothing from the Sets of the Tide had
occasion'd it; but I was presently convinc'd how it was, <I>viz</I>. That
the Tide of Ebb setting from the <I>West</I>, and joyning with the Current
of Waters from some great River on the Shore, must be the Occasion of this
Current; and that according as the Wind blew more forcibly from the <I>West</I>,
or from the <I>North</I>, this Current came nearer, or went farther from
the Shore; for waiting thereabouts till Evening, I went up to the Rock
again, and then the Tide of Ebb being made, I plainly saw the Current again
as before, only, that it run farther off, being near half a League from
the Shore; whereas in my Case, it set close upon the Shore, and hurry'd
me and my <I>Canoe</I> along with it, which at another Time it would not
have done.

<P>This Observation convinc'd me, That I had nothing to do but to observe
the Ebbing and the Flowing of the Tide, and I might very easily bring my
Boat about the Island again: But when I began to think of putting it in
Practice, I had such a Terror upon my Spirits at the Remembrance of the
Danger I had been in, that I could not think of it again with any Patience;
but on the contrary, I took up another Resolution which was more safe,
though more laborious; and this was, That I would build, or rather make
me another <I>Periagua</I> or Canoe; and so have one for one Side of the
Island, and one for the other.

<P>You are to understand, that now I had, as I may call it, two Plantations
in the Island; one my little Fortification or Tent, with the Wall about
it under the Rock, with the Cave behind me, which by this Time I had enlarg'd
into several Apartments, or Caves, one within another. One of these, which
was the dryest, and largest, and had a Door out beyond my Wall or Fortification;
that is to say, beyond where my Wall joyn'd to the Rock, was all fill'd
up with the large Earthen Pots, of which I have given an Account, and with
fourteen or fifteen great Baskets, which would hold five or six Bushels
each, where I laid up my Stores of Provision, especially my Corn, some
in the Ear cut off short from the Straw, and the other rubb'd out with
my Hand.

<P>A for my Wall made, <I>as before</I>, with long Stakes or Piles, those
Piles grew all like Trees, and were by this Time grown so big, and spread
so very much, that there was not the least Appearance to any one's View
of any Habitation behind them.

<P>Near this Dwelling of mine, but a little farther within the Land, and
upon lower Ground, lay my two Pieces of Corn-Ground, which I kept duly
cultivated and sow'd, and which duly yielded me their Harvest in its Season;
and whenever I had occasion for more Corn, I had more Land adjoyning as
fit as that.

<P>Besides this, I had my Country Seat, and I had now a tollerable Plantation
there also; for first, I had my little Bower, as I call'd it, which I kept
in Repair; <I>that is to say</I>, I kept the Hedge which circled it in,
constantly fitted up to its usual Height, the Ladder standing always in
the Inside; I kept the Trees which at first were no more than my Stakes,
but were now grown very firm and tall; I kept them always so cut, that
they might spread and grow thick and wild, and make the more agreeable
Shade, which they did effectually to my Mind. In the Middle of this I had
my Tent always standing, being a piece of a Sail spread over Poles set
up for that Purpose, and which never wanted any Repair or Renewing; and
under this I had made me a Squab or Couch, with the Skins of the Creatures
I had kill'd, and with other soft Things, and a Blanket laid on them, such
as belong'd to our Sea-Bedding, which I had saved, and a great Watch-Coat
to cover me; and here, whenever I had Occasion to be absent from my chief
Seat, I took up my Country Habitation.

<P>Adjoyning to this I had my Enclosures for my Cattle, that is to say,
my Goats: And as I had taken an inconceivable deal of Pains to fence and
enclose this Ground, so I was so uneasy to see it kept entire, lest the
Goats should break thro', that I never left off till with infinite Labour
I had stuck the Out-side of the Hedge so full of small Stakes, and so near
to one another, that it was rather a Pale than a Hedge, and there was scarce
Room to put a Hand thro' between them, which afterwards when those Stakes
grew, as they all did in the next rainy Season, made the Enclosure strong
like a Wall, indeed stronger than any Wall.

<P>This will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I spared no Pains
to bring to pass whatever appear'd necessary for my comfortable Support;
for I consider'd the keeping up a Breed of tame Creatures thus at my Hand,
would be a living Magazine of Flesh, Milk, Butter and Cheese, for me as
long as I liv'd in the Place, if it were to be forty Years; and that keeping
them in my Reach, depended entirely upon my perfecting my Enclosures to
such a Degree, that I might be of keeping them together; which by this
Method indeed I so effectually secur'd, that when these little Stakes began
to grow, I had planted them so very thick, I was forced to pw some of them
up again.

<P>In this Place also I had my Grapes growing, which I principally depended
on for my Winter Store of Raisins; and which I never fail'd to preserve
very carefully, as the best and most agreeable Dainty of my whole Diet;
and indeed they were not agreeable only, but physical, whole-some, nourishing,
and refreshing to the last Degree.

<P>As this was also about half Way between my other Habitation, and the
Place where I had laid up my Boat, I generally stay'd, and lay here in
my Way thither; for I used frequently to visit my Boat, and I kept all
Things about or belonging to her in very good Order; sometimes I went out
in her to divert my self, but no more hazardous Voyages would I go, nor
scarce ever above a Stone's Cast or two from the Shore, I was so apprehensive
of being hurry'd out my Knowledge again by the Currents, or Winds, or any
ether Accident. But now I come to a new Scene of my Life. It happen'd one
Day about Noon going towards my Boat, I was exceedingly surpriz'd with
the Print of a Man's naked Foot on the Shore, which was very plain to be
seen in the Sand: I stood like one Thunder-struck, or as if I had seen
an Apparition; I listen'd, I look'd round me, I could hear nothing, nor
see any Thing, I went up to a rising Ground to look farther, I went up
the Shore and down the Shore, but it was all one, I could see no other
Impression but that one, I went to it again to see if there were any more,
and to observe if it might not be my Fancy; but there was no Room for that,
for there was exactly the very Print of a Foot, Toes, Heel, and every Part
of a Foot; how it came thither, I knew not, nor could in the least imagine.
But after innumerable fluttering Thoughts, like a Man perfectly confus'd
and out of my self, I came Home to my Fortification, not feeling, as we
say, the Ground I went on, but terrify'd to the last Degree, looking behind
me at every two or three Steps, mistaking every Bush and Tree, and fancying
every Stump at a Distance to be a Man; nor is it possible to describe how
many various Shapes affrighted Imagination represented Things to me in,
how many wild Ideas were found every Moment in my Fancy, and what strange
unaccountable Whimsies came into my Thoughts by the Way.

<P>When I came to my Castle, for so I think I call'd it ever after this,
I fled into it like one pursued; whether I went over by the Ladder as first
contriv'd, or went in at the Hole in the Rock, which I call'd a Door, I
cannot remember; no, nor could I remember the next Morning, for never frighted
Hare fled to Cover, or Fox to Earth, with more Terror of Mind than I to
this Retreat.

<P>I slept none that Night; the farther I was from the Occasion of my Fright,
the greater my Apprehensions were, which is something contrary to the Nature
of such Things, and especially to the usual Practice of all Creatures in
Fear: But I was so embarrass'd with my own frightful Ideas of the Thing,
that I form'd nothing but dismal Imaginations to my self, even tho' I was
now a great way off of it. Sometimes I fancy'd it must be the Devil; and
Reason joyn'd in with me upon this Supposition: For how should any other
Thing in human Shape come into the Place? Where was the Vessel that brought
them? What Marks was there of any other Footsteps? And how was it possible
a Man should come there? But then to think that <I>Satan</I> should take
human Shape upon him in such a Place where there could be no manner of
Occasion for it, but to leave the Print of his Foot behind him, and that
even for no Purpose too, for he could not be sure I should see it; this
was an Amusement the other Way; I consider'd that the Devil might have
found out abundance of other Ways to have terrify'd me than this of the
single Print of a Foot. That as I liv'd quite on the other Side of the
Island, he would never have been so simple to leave a Mark in a Place where
'twas Ten Thousand to one whether I should ever see it Or not, and in the
Sand too, which the first Surge of the Sea upon a high Wind would have
defac'd entirely: All this seem'd inconsistent with the Thing it self,
and with all the Notions we usually entertain of the Subtilty of the Devil.

<P>Abundance of such Things as these assisted to argue me out' of all Apprehensions
of its being the Devil: And I presently concluded then, that it must be
some more dangerous Creature, (<I>viz</I>.) That it must be some of the
Savages of the main Land over-against me, who had wander'd out to Sea in
their <I>Canoes</I>; and either driven by the Currents, or by contrary
Winds had made the Island; and had been on Shore, but were gone away again
to Sea, being as loth, perhaps, to have stay'd in this desolate Island,
as I would have been to have had them.

<P>While these Reflections were rowling upon my Mind, I was very thankful
in my Thoughts, that I was so happy as not to be thereabouts at that Time,
or that they did not see my Boat, by which they would have concluded that
some Inhabitants had been in the Place, and perhaps have search'd farther
for me: Then terrible Thoughts rack'd my Imagination about their having
found my Boat, and that there were People here; and that if so, I should
certainly have them come again in greater Numbers, and devour me; that
if it should happen so that they should not find me, yet they would find
my Enclosure, destroy all my Corn, carry away all my Flock of tame Goats,
and I should perish at last for meer Want.

<P>Thus my Fear banish'd all my religious Hope; all that former Confidence
in God which was founded upon such wonderful Experience as I had had of
his Goodness, now vanished, as if he that had fed me by Miracle hitherto,
could not preserve by his Power the Provision which he had made for me
by his Goodness: I reproach'd my self with my Easiness, that would not
sow any more Corn one Year than would just serve me till the next Season,
as if no Accident could intervene to prevent my enjoying the Crop that
was upon the Ground; and this I thought so just a Reproof, that I resolv'd
for the future to have two or three Years Corn beforehand, so that whatever
might come, I might not perish for want of Bread.

<P>How strange a Chequer Work of Providence is the Life of Man! and by
what secret differing Springs are the Affections hurry'd about as differing
Circumstance present To Day we love what to Morrow we hate; to Day we seek
what to Morrow we shun; to Day we desire what to Morrow we fear; nay even
tremble at the Apprehensions of; this was exemplify'd in me at this Time
in the most lively Manner imaginable; for I whose only Affliction was,
that I seem'd banished from human Society, that I was alone, circumscrib'd
by the boundless Ocean, cut off from Mankind, and condemn'd to what I call'd
silent Life; that I was as one who Heaven thought not worthy to be number'd
among the Living, or to appear among the rest of his Creatures; that to
have seen one of my own Species, would have seem'd to me a Raising me from
Death to Life, and the greatest Blessing that Heaven it self, next to the
supreme Blessing of Salvation, could bestow; <I>I say</I>, that I should
now tremble at the very Apprehensions of seeing a Man, and was ready to
sink into the Ground at but the Shadow or silent Appearance of a Man's
having set his Foot in the Island.

<P>Such is the uneven State of human Life: And it afforded me a great many
curious Speculations afterwards, when I had a little recover'd my first
Surprize; I consider'd that this was the Station of Life the infinitely
wise and good Providence of God had determin'd for me, that as I could
not foresee what the Ends of Divine Wisdom might be in all this, so I was
not to dispute his Sovereignty, who, as I was his Creature, had an undoubted
Right by Creation to govern and dispose of me absolutely as he thought
fit; and who, as I was a Creature who had offended him, had likewise a
judicial Right to condemn me to what Punishment he thought fit; and that
it was my Part to submit to bear his Indignation, because I had sinn'd
against him.

<P>I then reflected that God, who was not only Righteous but Onmipotent,
as he had thought fit thus to punish and afflict me, so he was able to
deliver me; that if he did not think fit to do it, 'twas my unquestion'd
Duty to resign my self absolutely and entirely to his Will; and on the
other Hand, it was my Duty also to hope in him, pray to him, and quietly
to attend the Dictates and Directions of his daily Providence.

<P>These Thoughts took me up many Hours, Days; nay, I may say, Weeks and
Months; and one particular Effect of my Cogitations on this Occasion, I
cannot omit, viz. One Morning early, lying in my Bed, and fill'd with Thought
about my Danger from the Appearance of Savages, I found it discompos'd
me very much, upon which those Words of the Scripture came into my Thoughts,
<I>Call upon me in the Day of Trouble, and I will deliver, and thou shalt
glorify me</I>.

<P>Upon this, rising chearfully out of my Bed, my Heart was not only comforted,
but I was guided and encourag'd to pray earnestly to God for Deliverance:
When I had done praying, I took up my Bible, and opening it to read, the
first Words that presented to me, were, <I>Wait on the Lord, and be of
good Cheer, and he shall strengthen thy Heart; wait, I say, on the Lord:</I>
It is impossible to express the Comfort this gave me. In Answer, I thankfully
laid down the Book, and was no more sad, at least, not on that Occasion.

<P>In the middle of these Cogitations, Apprehensions and Reflections, it
came into my Thought one Day, that all this might be a meer Chimera of
my own; and that this Foot might be the Print of my own Foot, when I came
on Shore from my Boat: This chear'd me up a little too, and I began to
perswade my self it was all a Delusion; that it was nothing else but my
own Foot, and why might not I come that way from the Boat, as well as I
was going that way to the Boat; again, I consider'd also that I could by
no Means tell for certain where I had trod, and where I had not; and that
if at last this was only the Print of my own Foot, I had play'd the Part
of those Fools, who strive to make stories of Spectres, and Apparitions;
and then are frighted at them more than any body.

<P>Now I began to take Courage, and to peep abroad again; for I had not
stirr'd out of my Castle for three Days and Nights; so that I began to
starve for Provision; for I had little or nothing within Doors, but some
Barley Cakes and water. Then I knew that my Goats wanted to be milk'd too,
which usually was my Evening Diversion; and the poor Creatures were in
great Pain and Inconvenience for want of it; and indeed, it almost spoil'd
some of them, and almost dry'd up their Milk.

<P>Heartning my self therefore with the Belief that this was nothing but
the Print of one of my own Feet, and so I might be truly said to start
at my own Shadow, I began to go abroad again, and went to my Country House,
to milk my Flock; but to see with what Fear I went forward, how often I
look'd behind me, how I was ready every now and then to lay down my Basket,
and run for my Life, it would have made any one have thought I was haunted
with an evil Conscience, or that I had been lately most terribly frighted,
and so indeed I had.

<P>However, as I went down thus two or three Days, and having seen nothing,
I began to be a little bolder; and to think there was really nothing in
it, but my own Imagination: But I cou'd not perswade my self fully of this,
till I should go down to the Shore again, and see this Print of a Foot,
and measure it by my own, and see if there was any Similitude or Fitness,
that I might be assur'd it was my own Foot: But when I came to the Place,
<I>First</I>, It appear'd evidently to me, that when I laid up my Boat,
I could not possibly be on Shore any where there about. <I>Secondly</I>,
When I came to measure the Mark with my own Foot, I found my Foot not so
large by a great deal; both these Things fill'd my Head with new Imaginations,
and gave me the Vapours again, to the highest Degree; so that I shook with
cold, like one in an Ague: And I went Home again, fill'd with the Belief
that some Man Or Men had been on Shore there; or in short, that the Island
was inhabited, and I might be surpriz'd before I was aware; and what course
to take for my Security I knew not.

<P>O what ridiculous Resolution Men take, when possess'd with Fear! It
deprives them of the Use of those Means which Reason offers for their Relief.
The first Thing I propos'd to my self, was, to throw down my Enclosures,
and turn all my tame Cattle wild into the Woods, that the Enemy might not
find them; and then frequent the Island in Prospect of the same, or the
like Booty: Then to the simple' Thing of Digging up my two Corn Fields,
that they might not find such a Grain there, and still be prompted to frequent
the Island; then to demolish my Bower, and Tent, that they might not see
any Vestiges of Habitation, and be prompted to look farther, in order to
find out the Persons inhabiting.

<P>These were the Subject of the first Night's Cogitation, after I was
come Home again, while the Apprehensions which had so over-run my Mind
were fresh upon me, and my Head was full of Vapours, as above: Thus Fear
of Danger is ten thousand Times more terrifying than Danger it self, when
apparent to the Eyes; and we find the Burthen of Anxiety greater by much,
than the Evil which we are anxious about; and which was worse than all
this, I had not that Relief in this Trouble from the Resignation I used
to practice, that I hop'd to have. I look'd, I thought, like <I>Saul</I>,
who complain'd not only that the <I>Philistines</I> were upon him; but
that God had forsaken him; for I did not now take due Ways to compose my
Mind, by crying to God in my Distress, and resting upon his Providence,
as I had done before, for my Defence and Deliverance; which if I had done,
I had, at least, been more cheerfully supported under this new Surprise,
and perhaps carry'd through it with more Resolution.

<P>This Confusion of my Thoughts kept me waking all Night; but in the Morning
I fell asleep, and having by the Amusement of my Mind, been, as it were,
tyr'd, and my Spirits exhausted; I slept very soundly, and wak'd much better
compos'd than I had ever been before; and now I began to think sedately;
and upon the utmost Debate with my self, I concluded, That this Island,
which was so exceeding pleasant, fruitful, and no farther from the main
Land than as I had seen, was not so entirely abandon'd as I might imagine:
That altho' there were no stated Inhabitants who liv'd on the Spot; yet
that there might sometimes come Boats off from the Shore, who either with
Design, or perhaps never, but when they were driven by cross Winds, might
come to this Place.

<P>That I had liv'd here fifteen Years now, and had not met with the least
Shadow or Figure of any People yet; and that if at any Time they should
be driven here, it was probable they went away again as soon as ever they
could, seeing they had never thought fit to fix there upon any Occasion,
to this Time.

<P>That the most I cou'd suggest any Danger from, was, from any such casual
accidental Landing of straggling People from the Main, who, as it was likely
if they were driven hither, were here against their Wills; so they made
no stay here, but went off again with all possible Speed, seldom staying
one Night on Shore, least they should not have the Help of the Tides, and
Day-light back again; and that therefore I had nothing to do but to consider
of some safe Retreat, in Case I should see any Savages land upon the Spot.

<P>Now I began sorely to repent, that I had dug my Cave so large, as to
bring a Door through again, which Door, as I said, came out beyond where
my Fortification joyn'd to the Rock; upon maturely considering this therefore,
I resolv'd to draw me a second Fortification, in the same Manner of a Semicircle,
at a Distance from my Wall, just where I had planted a double Row of Trees,
about twelve Years before, of which I made mention: These Trees having
been planted so thick before, they wanted but a few Piles to be driven
between them, that they should be thicker, and stronger, and my Wall would
be soon finish'd.

<P>So that I had now a double Wall, and my Outer Wall was thickned with
Pieces Of Timber, old Cables, and every Thing I could think of, to make
it strong; having in it seven little Holes, about as big as I might put
my Arm out at: In the In-side of this, I thickned my Wall to above ten
Foot thick, with continual bringing Earth out of my Cave, and laying it
at the Foot of the Wall, and walking upon it; and through the seven Holes,
I contriv'd to plant the Musquets, of which I took Notice, that I got seven
on Shore out of the Ship; these, I say, I planted like my Cannon, and fitted
them into Frames that held them like a Carriage, that so I could fire all
the seven Guns in two Minutes Time: This Wall I was many a weary Month
a finishing, and yet never thought my self safe till it was done.

<P>When this was done, I stuck all the Ground without my Wall, for a great
way every way, as full with Stakes or Sticks of the <I>Osier</I> like Wood,
which I found so apt to grow, as they could well stand; insomuch, that
I believe I might set in near twenty thousand of them, leaving a pretty
large Space between them and my Wall, that I might have room to see an
Enemy, and they might have no shelter from the young Trees, if they attempted
to approach my outer Wall.

<P>Thus in two Years Time I had a thick Grove and in five or six Years
Time I had a Wood before my Dwelling, growing so monstrous thick and strong,
that it was indeed perfectly impassable; and no Men of what kind soever,
would ever imagine that there was any Thing beyond it, much less a Habitation:
As for the Way which I propos'd to my self to go in and out, for I left
no Avenue; it was by setting two Ladders, one to a Part of the Rock which
was low and then broke in, and left room to place another Ladder upon that;
so when the two Ladders were taken down, no Man living could come down
to me without mischieving himself; and if they had come down, they were
still on the Out-side of my outer Wall.

<P>Thus I took all the Measures humane Prudence could suggest for my own
Preservation; and it will be seen at length, that they were not altogether
without just Reason; though I foresaw nothing at that Time, more than my
meer Fear suggested to me.

<P>While this was doing, I was not altogether Careless of my other Affairs;
for I had a great Concern upon me, for my little Herd of Goats; they were
not only a present Supply to me upon every Occasion, and began to be sufficient
to me, without the Expence of Powder and Shot; but also without the Fatigue
of Hunting after the wild Ones, and I was loth to lose the Advantage of
them, and to have them all to nurse up over again.

<P>To this Purpose, after long Consideration, I could think of but two
Ways to preserve them; one was to find another convenient Place to dig
a Cave Under-ground, and to drive them into it every Night; and the other
was to enclose two or three little Bits of Land, remote from one another
and as much conceal'd as I could, where I might keep about half a Dozen
young Goats in each Place: So that if any Disaster happen'd to the Flock
in general, I might be able to raise them again with little Trouble and
Time: And this, tho' it would require a great deal of Time and Labour,
I thought was the most rational Design.

<P>Accordingly I spent some Time to find out the most retir'd Parts of
the Island; and I pitch'd upon one which was as private indeed as my Heart
could wish for; it was a little damp Piece of Ground in the Middle of the
hollow and thick Woods, where, as is observ'd, I almost lost my self once
before, endeavouring to Come back that Way from the Eastern Part of the
Island: Here I found a clear Piece of Land near three Acres, so surrounded
with Woods, that it was almost an Enclosure by Nature, at least it did
not want near so much Labour to make it so, as the other Pieces of Ground
I had work'd so hard at.

<P>I immediately went to Work with this Piece of Ground, and in less than
a Month's Time, I had so fenc'd it round, that my Flock or Herd, call it
which you please, who were not so wild now as at first they might be supposed
to be, were well enough secur'd in it. So, without any farther Delay, I
removed ten young She-Goats and two He-Goats to this Piece; and when they
were there, I continued to perfect the Fence till I had made it as secure
as the other, which, however, I did at more Leisure, and it took me up
more Time by a great deal.

<P>All this Labour I was at the Expence of, purely from my Apprehensions
on the Account of the Print of a Man's Foot which I had seen; for as yet
I never saw any human Creature come near the Island, and I had now liv'd
two Years under these Uneasinesses, which indeed made my Life much less
comfortable than it was before; as may well be imagin'd by any who know
what it is to live in the constant Snare of the Fear of Man; and this I
must observe with Grief too, that the Discomposure of my Mind had too great
Impressions also upon the religious Part of my Thoughts, for the Dread
and Terror of falling into the Hands of Savages and Canibals, lay so upon
my Spirits, that I seldom found my self in a due Temper for Application
to my Maker, at least not with the sedate Calmness and Resignation of Soul
which I was wont to do; I rather pray'd to God as under great Affliction
and Pressure of Mind, surrounded with Danger, and in Expectation every
Night of being murther'd and devour'd before Morning; and I must testify
from my Experience, that a Temper of Peace, Thankfulness, Love and Affection,
is much more the proper Frame for Prayer than that of Terror and Discomposure;
and that under the Dread of Mischief impending, a Man is no more fit for
a comforting Performance of the Duty of praying to God, than he is for
Repentance on a sick Bed: For these Discomposures affect the Mind as the
others do the Body; and the Discomposure of the Mind must necessarily be
as great a Disability as that of the Body, and much greater, Praying to
God being properly an Act Of the Mind, not of the Body.

<P>But to go on; After I had thus secur'd one Part of my little living
Stock, I went about the whole Island, searching for another private Place,
to make such another Deposit; when wandring more to the <I>West</I> Point
of the Island, than I had ever done yet, and looking out to Sea, I thought
I saw a Boat upon the Sea, at a great Distance; I had found a Prospective
Glass, or two, in one of the Seamen's Chests, which I sav'd out of our
Ship; but I had it not about me, and this was so remote, that I could not
tell what to make of it; though I look'd at it till my Eyes were not able
to hold to look any longer; whether it was a Boat, or not, I do not know;
but as I descended from the Hill, I could see no more of it, so I gave
it over; only I resolv'd to go no more out without a Prospective Glass
in my Pocket.

<P>When I was come down the Hill, to the End of the Island, where indeed
I had never been before, I was presently convinc'd, that the seeing the
Print of a Man's Foot, was not such a strange Thing in the Island as I
imagin'd; and but that it was a special Providence that I was cast upon
the Side of the Island, where the Savages never came: I should easily have
known, that nothing was more frequent than for the <I>Canoes</I> from the
Main, when they happen'd to be a little too far out at Sea, to shoot over
to that Side of the Island for Harbour; likewise as they often met, and
fought in their <I>Canoes</I>, the Victors having taken any Prisoners,
would bring them over to this Shore, where according to their dreadful
Customs, being all <I>Canibals</I>, they would kill and eat them; of which
hereafter.
