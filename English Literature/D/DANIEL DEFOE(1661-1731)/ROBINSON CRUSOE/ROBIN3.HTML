<P>When I was deliver'd and taken up at Sea by the <I>Portugal</I> Captain,
well us'd, and dealt justly and honourably with, as well as charitably,
I had not the least Thankfulness on my Thoughts: When again I was shipwreck'd,
ruin'd, and in Danger of drowning on this Island, I was as far from Remorse,
or looking on it as a Judgment; I only said to my self often, that I was
<I>an unfortunate Dog</I>, and born to be always miserable. It is true,
when I got on Shore first here, and found all my Ship's Crew drown'd, and
my self spar'd, I was surpriz'd with a Kind of Extasie, and some Transports
of Soul, which, had the Grace of God assisted, might have come up to true
Thankfulness; but it ended where it begun, in a meer common Flight of Joy,
or as I may say, <I>being glad I was alive</I>, without the least Reflection
upon the distinguishing Goodness of the Hand which had preserv'd me, and
had singled me out to be preserv'd, when all the rest were destroy'd; or
an Enquiry why Providence had been thus merciful to me; even just the same
common Sort of Joy which Seamen generally have after they are got safe
ashore from a Shipwreck, which they drown all in the next Bowl of Punch,
and forget almost as soon as it is over, and all the rest of my Life was
like it.

<P>Even when I was afterwards, on due Consideration, made sensible of my
Condition, how I was cast on this dreadful Place, out of the Reach of humane
Kind, out of all Hope of Relief, or Prospect of Redemption, as soon as
I saw but a Prospect of living, and that I should not starve and perish
for Hunger, all the Sense of my Affliction wore off, and I begun to be
very easy, apply'd my self to the Works proper for my Preservation and
Supply, and was far enough from being afflicted at my Condition, as a Judgment
from Heaven, or as the Hand of God against me; these were Thoughts which
very seldom enter'd into my Head.

<P>The growing up of the Corn, as is hinted in my Journal, had at first
some little Influence upon me, and began to affect me with Seriousness,
as long as I thought it had something miraculous in it; but as soon as
ever that Part of the Thought was remov'd, all the Impression which was
rais'd from it, wore off also, as I have noted already.

<P>Even the Earthquake, tho' nothing could be more terrible in its Nature,
or more immediately directing to the invisible Power which alone directs
such Things, yet no sooner was the first Fright over, but the Impression
it had made went off also. I had no more Sense of God or his Judgments,
much less of the present Affliction of my Circumstances being from his
Hand, than if I had been in the most prosperous Condition of Life.

<P>But now when I began to be sick, and a leisurely View of the Miseries
of Death came to place itself before me; when my Spirits began to sink
under the Burthen of a strong Distemper, and Nature was exhausted with
the Violence of the Feaver; Conscience that had slept so long, begun to
awake, and I began to reproach my self with my past Life, in which I had
so evidently, by uncommon Wickedness, provok'd the Justice of God to lay
me under uncommon Strokes, and to deal with me in so vindictive a Manner.

<P>These Reflections oppress'd me for the second or third Day of my Distemper,
and in the Violence, as well of the Feaver, as of the dreadful Reproaches
of my Conscience, extorted some Words from me, like praying to God, tho'
I cannot say they were either a Prayer attended with Desires or with Hopes;
it was rather the Voice of meer Fright and Distress; my Thoughts were confus'd,
the Convictions great upon my Mind, and the Horror of dying in such a miserable
Condition rais'd Vapours into my Head with the meer Apprehensions; and
in these Hurries of my Soul, I know not what my Tongue might express: but
it was rather Exclamation, such as, Lord! what a miserable Creature am
I? If I should be sick, I shall certainly die for Want of Help, and what
will become of me! Then the Tears burst out of my Eyes, and I could say
no more for a good while.

<P>In this Interval, the good Advice of my Father came to my Mind, and
presently his Prediction which I mention'd at the Beginning of this Story,
<I>viz. That if I did take this foolish Step, God would not bless me, and
I would have Leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected his Counsel,
when there might be none to assist in my Recovery</I>. Now, said I aloud,
My dear Father's Words are come to pass: God's Justice has overtaken me,
and I have none to help or hear me: I rejected the Voice of Providence,
which had mercifully put me in a Posture or Station of Life, wherein I
might have been happy and easy; but I would neither see it my self, or
learn to know the Blessing of it from my Parents; I left them to mourn
over my Folly, and now I am left to mourn under the Consequences of it:
I refus'd their Help and Assistance who wou'd have lifted me into the World,
and wou'd have made every Thing easy to me, and now I have Difficulties
to struggle with, too great for even Nature itself to support, and no Assistance,
no Help, no Comfort, no Advice; then I cry'd out, <I>Lord be my Help, for
I am in great Distress</I>.

<P>This was the first Prayer, if I may call it so, that I had made for
many Years: But 1 return to my Journal.

<P><I>June</I> 28. Having been somewhat refresh'd with the Sleep I had
had, and the Fit being entirely off, I got up; and tho' the Fright and
Terror of my Dream was very great, yet I consider'd, that the Fit of the
Ague wou'd return again the next Day, and now was my Time to get something
to refresh and support my self when I should be ill; and the first Thing
I did, I fill'd a large square Case Bottle with Water, and set it upon
my Table, in Reach of my Bed; and to take off the chill or aguish Disposition
of the Water, I put about a Quarter of a Pint of Rum into it, and mix'd
them together; then I got me a Piece of the Goat's Flesh, and broil'd it
on the Coals, but could eat very little; I walk'd about, but was very weak,
and withal very sad and heavy-hearted in the Sense of my miserable Condition;
dreading the Return of my Distemper the next Day; at Night I made my Supper
of three of the Turtle's Eggs, which I roasted in the Ashes, and eat, as
we call it, in the Shell; and this was the first Bit of Meat I had ever
ask'd God's Blessing to, even as I cou'd remember, in my whole Life.

<P>After I had eaten, I try'd to walk, but found my self so weak, that
I cou'd hardly carry the Gun, (for I never went out without that) so I
went but a little Way, and sat down upon the Ground, looking out upon the
Sea, which was just before me, and very calm and smooth: As I sat here,
some such Thoughts as these occurred to me.

<P>What is this Earth and Sea of which I have seen so much, whence is it
produc'd, and what am I, and all the other Creatures, wild and tame, humane
and brutal, whence are we?

<P>Sure we are all made by some secret Power, who form'd the Earth and
Sea, the Air and Sky; and who is that?

<P>Then it follow'd most naturally, It is God that has made it all: Well,
but then it came on strangely, if God has made all these Things, He guides
and governs them all, and all Things that concern them; for the Power that
could make all Things, must certainly have Power to guide and direct them.

<P>If so, nothing can happen in the great Circuit of his Works, either
without his Knowledge or Appointment.

<P>And if nothing happens without his Knowledge, he knows that I am here,
and am in this dreadful Condition; and if nothing happens without his Appointment,
he has appointed all this to befal me.

<P>Nothing occurr'd to my Thought to contradict any of these Conclusions;
and therefore it rested upon me with the greater Force, that it must needs
be, that God had appointed all this to befal me; that I was brought to
this miserable Circumstance by his Direction, he having the sole Power,
not of me only, but of every Thing that happen'd in the World. Immediately
it follow'd,

<P><I>Why has God done this to me? What have I done to be thus us'd?</I>

<P>My Conscience presently check'd me in that Enquiry, as if I had blasphem'd,
and methought it spoke to me like a Voice; <I>WRETCH! dost thou ask what
thou hast done!</I> look back upon a dreadful mis-spent Life, and ask thy
self <I>what thou hast not done?</I> ask, Why is it <I>that thou wert not
long ago destroy'd?</I> Why <I>wert thou not drown'd in Yarmouth Roads?
Kill'd in the Fight when the Ship was taken by</I> the Sallee Man of War?
<I>Devour'd by the wild Beasts on the</I> Coast of Africa? Or, <I>Drown'd
HERE, when all the Crew perish'd but thy self?</I> Dost thou ask, <I>What
have I done?</I>

<P>I was struck dumb with these Reflections, as one astonish'd, and had
not a Word to say, no not to answer to my self, but rise up pensive and
sad, walk'd back to my Retreat, and went up over my Wall, as if I had been
going to Bed, but my Thoughts were sadly disturb'd, and I had no Inclination
to Sleep; so I sat down in my Chair, and lighted my Lamp, for it began
to be dark: Now as the Apprehension of the Return of my Distemper terrify'd
me very much, it occurr'd to my Thought, that the <I>Brasilians</I> take
no Physick but their Tobacco, for almost all Distempers; and I had a Piece
of a Roll of Tobacco in one of the Chests, which was quite cur'd, and some
also that was green and not quite cur'd.

<P>I went, directed by Heaven no doubt; for in this Chest I found a Cure,
both for Soul and Body, I open'd the Chest, and found what I look'd for,
<I>viz.</I> the Tobacco; and as the few Books, I had sav'd, lay there too,
I took out one of the Bibles which I mention'd before, and which to this
Time I had not found Leisure, or so much as Inclination to look into; I
say, I took it out, and brought both that and the Tobacco with me to the
Table.

<P>What Use to make of the Tobacco, I knew not, as to my Distemper, or
whether it was good for it or no; but I try'd several Experiments with
it, as if I was resolv'd it should hit one Way or other: I first took a
Piece of a Leaf, and chew'd it in my Mouth, which indeed at first almost
stupify'd my Brain, the Tobacco being green and strong, and that I had
not been much us'd to it; then I took some and steeped it an Hour or two
in some Rum, and resolv'd to take a Dose of it when I lay down; and lastly,
I burnt some upon a Pan of Coals, and held my Nose close over the Smoke
of it as long as I could bear it, as well for the Heat as almost for Suffocation.

<P>In the Interval of this Operation, I took up the Bible and began to
read, but my Head was too much disturb'd with the Tobacco to bear reading,
at least that Time; only having open'd the Book casually, the first Words
that occurr'd to me were these, <I>Call on me in the Day of Trouble, and
I will deliver, and thou shalt glorify me</I>.

<P>The Words were very apt to my Case, and made some Impression upon my
Thoughts at the Time of reading them, tho' not so much as they did afterwards;
for as for being deliver'd, the Word had no Sound, <I>as I may say</I>,
to me; the Thing was so remote, so impossible in my Apprehension of Things,
that I began to say as the Children of <I>Israel</I> did, when they were
promis'd Flesh to eat, <I>Can God spread a Table in the Wilderness?</I>
so I began to say, Can God himself deliver me from this Place? and as it
was not for many Years that any Hope appear'd, this prevail'd very often
upon my Thoughts: But however, the Words made a great Impression upon me,
and I mused upon them very often. It grew now late, and the Tobacco had,
as I said, doz'd my Head so much, that I inclin'd to sleep; so I left my
Lamp burning in the Cave, least I should want any Thing in the Night, and
went to Bed; but before I lay down, I did what I never had done in all
my Life, I kneel'd down and pray'd to God to fulfil the Promise to me,
that if I call'd upon him in the Day of Trouble, he would deliver me; after
my broken and imperfect Prayer was over, I drunk the Rum in which I had
steep'd the Tobacco, which was so strong and rank of the Tobacco, that
indeed I could scarce get it down; immediately upon this I went to Bed,
I found presently it flew up in my Head violently, but I fell into a sound
Sleep, and wak'd no more 'till by the Sun it must necessarily be near Three
a-Clock in the Afternoon the next Day; nay, to this Hour, I'm partly of
the Opinion, that I slept all the next Day and Night, and 'till almost
Three that Day after; for otherwise I knew not how I should lose a Day
out of my Reckoning in the Days of the Week, as it appear'd some Years
after I had done: for if I had lost it by crossing and re-crossing the
Line, I should have lost more than one Day: But certainly I lost a Day
in my Accompt, and never knew which Way.

<P>Be that however one Way or th' other, when I awak'd I found my self
exceedingly refresh'd, and my Spirits lively and chearful; when I got up,
I was stronger than I was the Day before, and my Stomach better, for I
was hungry; and in short, I had no Fit the next Day, but continu'd much
alter'd for the better; this was the 29th.

<P>The 30th was my well Day of Course, and I went abroad with my Gun, but
did not care to travel too far, I kill'd a Sea Fowl or two, something like
a brand Goose, and brought them Home, but was not very forward to eat them;
so I ate some more of the Turtle's Eggs, which were very good: This Evening
I renew'd the Medicine which I had suppos'd did me good the Day before,
<I>viz</I>. the Tobacco steep'd in Rum, only I did not take so much as
before, nor did I chew any of the Leaf, or hold my Head over the Smoke;
however, I was not so well the next Day, which was the first of <I>July</I>,
as I hop'd I shou'd have been; for I had a little Spice of the cold Fit,
but it was not much.

<P><I>July</I> 2. I renew'd the Medicine all the three Ways, and doz'd
my self with it as at first; and doubled the Quantity which I drank.

<P>3. I miss'd the Fit for good and all, tho' I did not recover my full
Strength for some Weeks after; while I was thus gathering Strength, my
Thoughts run exceedingly upon this Scripture, <I>I will deliver thee</I>,
and the Impossibility of my Deliverance lay much upon my Mind in Barr of
my ever expecting it: But as I was discouraging my self with such Thoughts,
it occurr'd to my Mind, that I pored so much upon my Deliverance from the
main Affliction, that I disregarded the Deliverance I had receiv'd; and
I was, as it were, made to ask my self such Questions as these, <I>viz.</I>
Have I not been deliver'd, and wonderfully too, from Sickness? from the
most distress'd Condition that could be, and that as so frightful to me,
and what Notice I had taken of it?

<P>Had I done my Part? <I>God had deliver'd me, but I had not glorify'd
him;</I> that is to say, I had not own'd and been thankful for that as
a Deliverance, and how cou'd I expect greater Deliverance?

<P>This touch'd my Heart very much, and immediately I kneel'd down and
gave God Thanks aloud, for my Recovery from my Sickness.

<P><I>July</I> 4. In the Morning I took the Bible, and beginning at the
New Testament, I began seriously to read it, and impos'd upon my self to
read a while every Morning and every Night, not tying my self to the Number
of Chapters, but as long as my Thoughts shou'd engage me: It was not long
after I set seriously to this Work, but I found my Heart more deeply and
sincerely affected with the Wickedness of my past Life: The Impression
of my Dream reviv'd, and the Words, <I>All these Things have not brought
thee to Repentance</I>, ran seriously in my Thought: I was earnestly begging
of God to give me Repentance, when it happen'd providentially the very
Day that reading the Scripture, I came to these Words, <I>He is exalted
a Prince and a Saviour, to give Repentance, and to give Remission</I>:
I threw down the Book, and with my Heart as well as my Hands lifted up
to Heaven, in a Kind of Extasy of Joy, I cry'd out aloud, <I>Jesus, thou
Son of</I> David, <I>Jesus, thou exalted Prince and Saviour, give me Repentance!</I>

<P>This was the first Time that I could say, in the true Sense of the Words,
that I pray'd in all my Life; for now I pray'd with a Sense of my Condition,
and with a true Scripture View of Hope founded on the Encouragement of
the Word of God; and from this Time, I may say, I began to have Hope that
God would hear me.

<P>Now I began to construe the Words mentioned above, <I>Call on me, and
I will deliver you</I>, in a different Sense from what I had ever done
before; for then I had no Notion of any thing being call'd Deliverance,
but my being deliver'd from the Captivity I was in; for tho' I was indeed
at large in the Place, yet the Island was certainly a Prison to me, and
that in the worst Sense in the World; but now I learn'd to take it in another
Sense: Now I look'd back upon my past Life with such Horrour, and my Sins
appear'd so dreadful, that my Soul sought nothing of God, but Deliverance
from the Load of Guilt that bore down all my Comfort: As for my Solitary
Life it was nothing; I did not SO much as pray to be deliver'd from it,
or think of it; It was all of no Consideration in Comparison to this: And
I add this Part here, to hint to whoever shall read it, that whenever they
come to a true Sense of things, they will find Deliverance from Sin a much
greater Blessing, than Deliverance from Affliction.

<P>But leaving this Part, I return to my Journal.

<P>My Condition began now to be, tho' not less miserable as my Way of living,
yet much easier to my Mind; and my Thoughts being directed, by a constant
reading the Scripture, and praying to God, to things of a higher Nature:
I ad a great deal of Comfort within, which till now I knew nothing of;
also, as my Health and Strength returned, I bestirr'd my self to furnish
my self with every thing that I anted, and make my Way of living as regular
as I could.

<P>From the 4th of <I>July</I> to the 24th, I was chiefly employ'd walking
about with my Gun in my Hand, a little and a little, at a Time, as a Man
that was gathering up his Strength after a Fit of Sickness: For it is hardly
to be imagin'd, how low I was, and to what Weakness I was reduc'd. The
Application which I made Use of was perfectly new, and perhaps what had
never cur'd an Ague before, neither can recommend it to any one to practise,
by this Experiment; and tho' it did carry off the Fit, yet it rather contributed
to weakening me; for I had frequent Convulsions in my Nerves and Limbs
for some Time.

<P>I learn'd from it also this in particular, that being abroad the rainy
Season was the most pernicious thing to my Health that could be, especially
in those Rains which came ended with Storms and Hurricanes of Wind; for
as the in which came in the dry Season was always most accompany'd with
such Storms, so I found that Rain was much more dangerous than the Rain
which fell in <I>September</I> and <I>October.</I>

<P>I had been now in this unhappy Island above 10 Months, all Possibility
of Deliverance from this Condition, seem'd to be entirely taken from me;
and I firmly believed, that no humane Shape had ever set Foot upon that
Place: Having now secur'd my Habitation, as I thought, fully to my Mind,
I had a great Desire to make a more perfect Discovery of the Island, and
to see what other Productions I might find, which I yet knew nothing of.

<P>It was the 15th of <I>July</I> that I began to take a more particular
Survey of the Island it self: I went up the Creek first, where, as I hinted,
I brought my Rafts on Shore; I found after I came about two Miles up, that
the Tide did not flow any higher, and that it was no more than a little
Brook of running Water, and very fresh and good; but this being the dry
Season, there was hardly any Water in some Parts of it, at least, not enough
to run in any Stream, so as it could be perceiv'd.

<P>On the Bank of this Brook I found many pleasant <I>Savana's</I>, or
Meadows; plain, smooth, and cover'd with Grass; and on the rising Parts
of them next to the higher Grounds, where the Water, as it might be supposed,
never overflow'd I found a great deal of Tobacco, green, and growing to
great and very strong Stalk; there were divers other Plants which I had
no Notion of, or Understanding about, and might perhaps have Vertues of
their own, which I could find out.

<P>I searched for the <I>Cassava</I> Root, which the <I>Indians</I> in
all that climate make their Bread of, but I could find I saw large Plants
of Alloes, but did not then understand them. I saw several Sugar Canes,
but wild, and for Cultivation, imperfect. I contented my self with these
Discoveries for this Time, and came back musing with myself what Course
I might take to know the Vertue and Goodness of any of the Fruits or Plants
which I should discover; but could bring it to no Conclusion; for in short,
I had made so little Observation while I wad in the <I>Brasils</I>, that
I knew little of the Plants in the Field, at least very little that might
serve me to any Purpose now in my Distress.

<P>The next Day, the 16th, I went up the same Way again, and after going
something farther than I had gone the Day before, I found the Brook, and
the <I>Savana's</I> began to cease, and the Country became more woody than
before; in this Part I found different Fruits, and particularly I found
Mellons upon the Ground in great Abundance, and Grapes upon the Trees;
the Vines had spread indeed over the Trees, and the Clusters of Grapes
were just now in their Prime, very ripe and rich: This was a surprising
Discovery, and I was exceeding glad of them; but I was warn'd by my Experience
to eat sparingly of them, remembring, that when I was ashore in <I>Barbary</I>,
the eating of Grapes kill'd several of our <I>English</I> Men who were
Slaves there, by throwing them into Fluxes and Feavers: But I found an
excellent Use for these Grapes, and that was to cure or dry them in the
Sun, and keep them as dry'd Grapes or Raisins are kept, which I thought
would be, as indeed they were, as wholesom as agreeable to eat, when no
Grapes might be to be had.

<P>I spent all that Evening there, and went not back to my Habitation,
which by the Way was the first Night, as I might say, I had lain from Home.
In the Night I took my first Contrivance, and got up into a Tree, where
I slept well, and the next Morning proceeded upon my Discovery, travelling
near four Miles, as I might judge by the Length of the Valley, keeping
still due North, with a Ridge of Hills on the South and North-side of me.

<P>At the End of this March I came to an Opening, where the Country seem'd
to descend to the West, and a little Spring of fresh Water which issued
out of the Side of the Hill by me, run the other Way, that is due East;
and the Country appear'd so fresh, so green, so flourishing, every thing
being in a constant Verdure, or Flourish of <I>Spring</I>, that it looked
like a planted Garden.

<P>I descended a little on the Side of that delicious Vale, surveying it
with a secret Kind of Pleasure, (tho' mixt with my other afflicting Thoughts)
to think that this was all my own, that I was King and Lord of all this
Country indefeasibly, and had a Right of Possession; and if I could convey
it, I might have it in Inheritance, as compleatly as any Lord of a Mannor
in <I>England</I>. I saw here Abundance of Cocoa Trees, Orange, and Lemmon,
and Citron Trees; but all wild, and very few bearing any Fruit, at least
not then: However, the green Limes that I gathered, were not only pleasant
to eat, but very wholesome; and I mix'd their Juice afterwards with Water,
which made it very wholesome, and very cool, and refreshing.

<P>I found now I had Business enough to gather and carry Home; and I resolv'd
to lay up a Store, as well of Grapes, as Limes and Lemons, to furnish my
self for the wet Season, which I knew was approaching.

<P>In Order to this, I gather'd a great Heap of Grapes in one Place, and
a lesser Heap in another Place, and a great Parcel of Limes and Lemons
in another Place; and taking a few of each with me, I travell'd homeward,
and resolv'd to come again, and bring a Bag or Sack, or what I could make
to carry the rest Home.

<P>Accordingly, having spent three Days in this Journey, I came Home; so
I must now call my Tent and my Cave: But, before I got thither, the Grapes
were spoil'd; the Richness of the Fruits, and the Weight of the Juice having
broken them, and bruis'd them, they were good for little or nothing; as
to the Limes, they were good, but I could bring but a few.

<P>The next Day, being the 19th, I went back, having made me two small
Bags to bring Home my Harvest: But I was surpriz'd, when coming to my Heap
of Grapes, which were so rich and fine when I gather'd them, I found them
all spread about, trod to Pieces, and dragg'd about, some here, some there,
and Abundance eaten and devour'd: By this I concluded, there were some
wild Creatures thereabouts, which had done this; but what they were, I
knew not.

<P>However, as I found there there was no laying them up on Heaps, and
no carrying them away in a Sack, but that one Way they would be destroy'd,
and the other Way they would be crush'd with their own Weight. I took another
Course; for I gather'd a large Quantity of the Grapes, and hung them up
upon the out Branches of the Trees, that they might cure and dry in the
Sun; and as for the Limes and Lemons, I carry'd as many back as I could
well stand under.

<P>When I came Home from this Journey, I contemplated with great Pleasure
the Fruitfulness of that Valley, and the Pleasantness of the Scituation,
the Security from Storms on that Side the Water, and the Wood, and concluded,
that I had pitch'd upon a Place to fix my Abode, which was by far the worst
Part of the Country. Upon the Whole I began to consider of removing my
Habitation; and to look out for a ace equally safe, as where I now was
scituate, if possible, in that pleasant fruitful Part of the Island.

<P>This Thought run long in my Head, and I was exceeding fond of it for
some Time, the Pleasantness of the Place tempting me; but when I came to
a nearer View of it, and to consider that I was now by the Sea-Side, where
it was at least possible that something might happen to my Advantage, and
by the same ill Fate that brought me hither, might bring some other unhappy
Wretches to the same Place; and tho' it was scarce probable that any such
Thing should ever happen, yet to enclose my self among the Hills and Woods,
in the Center of the Island, was to anticipate my Bondage, and to render
such an Affair not only Improbable, but Impossible; and that therefore
I ought not by any Means to remove.

<P>However, I was so Enamour'd of this Place, that I spent much of my Time
there, for the whole remaining Part of the Month of <I>July</I>; and tho'
upon second Thoughts I resolv'd as above, not to remove, yet I built me
a little kind of a Bower, and surrounded it at a Distance with a strong
Fence, being a double Hedge, as high as I could reach, well stak'd, and
fill'd between with <I>Brushwood</I>; and here I lay very secure, sometimes
two or three Nights together, always going over it with a Ladder, as before;
so that I fancy'd now I had my Country-House, and my Sea-Coast-House: And
this Work took me up to the Beginning of <I>August</I>.

<P>I had but newly finish'd my Fence, and began to enjoy my Labour, but
the Rains came on, and made me stick close to my first Habitation; for
tho' I had made me a Tent like the other, with a Piece of a Sail, and spread
it very well; yet I had not the Shelter of a Hill to keep me from Storms,
nor a Cave behind me to retreat into, when the Rains were extraordinary.

<P>About the Beginning of <I>August</I>, as I said, I had finish'd my Bower,
and began to enjoy my self. The third of <I>August</I>, I found the Grapes
I had hung up were perfectly dry'd, and indeed, were excellent good Raisins
of the Sun; so I began to take them down from the Trees, and it was very
happy that I did so; for the Rains which follow'd would have spoil'd them,
and I had lost the best Part of my Winter Food; for I had above two hundred
large Bunches of them. No sooner had I taken them all down, and carry'd
most of them Home to my Cave, but it began to rain, and from hence, which
was the fourteenth of <I>August</I>, it rain'd more or less, every Day,
till the Middle of <I>October</I>; and sometimes so violently, that I could
not stir out of my Cave for several Days.

<P>In this Season I was much surpriz'd with the Increase of my Family;
I had been concern'd for the Loss of one of my Cats, who run away from
me, or as I thought had been dead, and I heard no more Tale or Tidings
of her, till to my Astonishment she came Home about the End of <I>August</I>,
with three <I>Kittens</I>; this was the more strange to me, because tho'
I had kill'd a wild Cat, as I call'd it, with my Gun; yet I thought it
was a quite differing Kind from our <I>European</I> Cats; yet the young
Cats were the same Kind of House breed like the old one; and both my Cats
being Females, I thought it very strange: But from these three Cats, I
afterwards came to be so pester'd with Cats, that I was forc'd to kill
them like Vermine, or wild Beasts, and to drive them from my House as much
as possible.

<P>From the fourteenth of <I>August</I> to the twenty sixth, incessant
Rain, so that I could not stir, and was now very careful not to be much
wet. In this Confinement I began to be straitned for Food, but venturing
out twice, I one Day kill'd a Goat, and the last Day, which was the twenty
sixth, found a very large Tortoise, which was a Treat to me, and my Food
was regulated thus; I eat a Bunch of Raisins for my Breakfast, a Piece
of the Goat's Flesh, or of the Turtle for my Dinner broil'd; for to my
great Misfortune, I had no Vessel to boil or stew any Thing; and two or
three of the Turtle's Eggs for my Supper.

<P>During this Confinement in my Cover, by the Rain, I work'd daily two
or three Hours at enlarging my Cave, and by Degrees work'd it on towards
one Side, till I came to the Out-Side of the Hill, and made a Door or Way
out, which came beyond my Fence or Wall, and so I came in and out this
Way; but I was not perfectly easy at lying so open; for as I had manag'd
my self before, I was in a perfect Enclosure, whereas now I thought I lay
expos'd, and open for any Thing to come in upon me; and yet I could not
perceive that there was any living Thing to fear, the biggest Creature
that I had yet seen upon the Island being a Goat.

<P><I>September</I> the thirtieth, I was now come to the unhappy Anniversary
of my Landing. I cast up the Notches on my Post, and found I had been on
Shore three hundred and sixty five Days. I kept this Day as a Solemn Fast,
Setting it apart to Religious Exercise, prostrating my self on the Ground
with the most serious Humiliation, confessing my Sins to God, acknowledging
his Righteous Judgments upon me, and praying to him to have Mercy on me,
through Jesus Christ; and having not tasted the least Refreshment for twelve
Hours, even till the going down of the Sun, I then eat a Bisket Cake, and
a Bunch of Grapes, and went to Bed, finishing the Day as I began it.

<P>I had all this Time observ'd no Sabbath-Day; for as at first I had no
Sense of Religion upon my Mind, I had after some Time omitted to distinguish
the Weeks, by making a longer Notch than ordinary for the Sabbath-Day,
and so did not really know what any Of the Days were; but now having cast
up the Days, as above, I found I had been there a Year; so I divided it
into Weeks, and set apart every seventh Day for a Sabbath; though I found
at the End of my Account I had lost a Day or two in my Reckoning.

<P>A line after this my Ink began to fail me, and so I contented my self
to use it more sparingly, and to write down only the most remarkable Events
of my Life, without continuing a daily <I>Memorandum</I> of other Things.

<P>The rainy Season, and the dry Season, began now to appear regular to
me, and I learn'd to divide them so, as to provide for them accordingly.
But I bought all my Experience before I had it; and this I am going to
relate, was one of the most discouraging Experiments that I made at all:
I have mention'd that I had sav'd the few Ears of Barley and Rice, which
I had so surprizingly found spring up, as I thought, of themselves, and
believe there was about thirty Stalks of Rice, and about twenty of Barley;
and now I thought it a proper Time to sow it after the Rains, the Sun being
in its <I>Southern</I> Position going from me.

<P>Accordingly I dug up a Piece of Ground as well as I could with my wooden
Spade, and dividing it into two Parts, I sow'd my Grain; but as I was sowing,
it casually occur'd to my Thoughts, That I would not sow it all at first,
because I did not know when was the proper Time for it; so I sow'd about
two Thirds of the Seed, leaving about a Handful of each.

<P>It was a great Comfort to me afterwards, that I did so, for not one
Grain of that I sow'd this Time came to any Thing; for the dry Months following,
the Earth having had no Rain after the Seed was sown, it had no Moisture
to assist its Growth, and never came up at all, till the wet Season had
come again, and then it grew as if it had been but newly sown.

<P>Finding my first Seed did not grow, which I easily imagin'd was by the
Drought, I fought for a moister Piece of Ground to make another Trial in,
and I dug up a Piece of Ground near my new Bower, and sow'd the rest of
my Seed in <I>February</I>, a little before the <I>Vernal Equinox;</I>
and this having the rainy Months of March and April to water it, sprung
up very pleasantly, and yielded a very good Crop; but having Part of the
Seed left only, and not daring to sow all that I had I had but a small
Quantity at last, my whole Crop not amounting to above half a Peck of each
kind.

<P>But by this Experiment I was made Master of my Business, and knew exactly
when the proper Season was to sow; and that I might expect two Seed Times,
and two Harvests every Year.

<P>While this Corn was growing, I made a little Discovery which was of
use to me afterwards: As soon as the Rains were over, and the Weather began
to settle, which was about the Month of <I>November</I>, I made a Visit
up the Country to my Bower, where though I had not been some Months, yet
I found all Things just as I left them. The Circle or double Hedge that
I had made, was not only firm and entire; but the Stakes which I had cut
out of some Trees that grew thereabouts, were all shot out and grown with
long Branches, as much as a Willow-Tree usually shoots the first Year after
lopping its Head. I could not tell what Tree to call it, that these Stakes
were cut from. I was surpriz'd, and yet very well pleas'd, to see the young
Trees grow; and I prun'd them, and led them up to grow as much alike as
I could; and it is scarce credible how beautiful a Figure they grew into
in three Years; so that though the Hedge made a Circle of about twenty
five Yards in Diameter, yet the Trees, for such I might now call them,
soon cover'd it; and it was a compleat Shade, sufficient to lodge under
all the dry Season.

<P>This made me resolve to cut some more Stakes, and make me a Hedge like
this in a Semicircle round my Wall; I mean that of my first Dwelling, which
I did; and placing the Trees or Stakes in a double Row, at about eight
Yards distance from my first Fence, they grew presently, and were at first
a fine Cover to my Habitation, and afterward serv'd for a Defence also,
as I shall observe in its Order.

<P>I found now, That the Seasons of the Year might generally be divided,
not into Summer and Winter, as in Europe; but into the Rainy Seasons, and
the Dry Seasons, which were generally thus,
<BLOCKQUOTE>Half <I>February, March</I>, Half <I>April</I>,
<BR>Rainy, the Sun being then on, or near the <I>Equinox</I>.

<P>Half <I>April, May, June, July</I>, Half <I>August</I>,
<BR>Dry, the <I>Sun</I> being then to the <I>North</I> of the Line.

<P>Half <I>August, September</I>, Half <I>October</I>,
<BR>Rainy, the <I>Sun</I> being then come back.

<P>Half <I>October, November, December, January</I>, Half <I>February</I>,
<BR>Dry, the <I>Sun</I> being then to the <I>South</I> of the Line.</BLOCKQUOTE>
The Rainy Season sometimes held longer or shorter, as the Winds happen'd
to blow; but this was the general Observation I made: After I had found
by Experience, the ill Consequence of being abroad in the Rain. I took
Care to furnish my self with Provisions before hand, that I might not be
oblig'd to go out; and I sat within Doors as much as possible during the
wet Months.

<P>This Time I found much Employment, (and very suitable also to the Time)
for I found great Occasion of many Things which I had no way to furnish
my self with, but by hard Labour and constant Application; particularly,
I try'd many Ways to make my self a Basket, but all the Twigs I could get
for the Purpose prov'd so brittle, that they would do nothing. It prov'd
of excellent Advantage to me now, That when I was a Boy, I used to take
great Delight in standing at a <I>Basketmaker's</I>, in the Town where
my Father liv'd, to see them make their <I>Wicker-ware</I>; and being as
Boys usually are, very officious to help, and a great Observer of the Manner
how they work'd those Things, and sometimes lending a Hand, I had by this
Means full Knowledge of the Methods of it, that I wanted nothing but the
Materials; when it came into my Mind, That the Twigs of that Tree from
whence I cut my Stakes that grew, might possibly be as tough as the <I>Sallow's</I>,
and <I>Willows</I>, and <I>Osiers</I> in <I>England</I>, and I resolv'd
to try.

<P>Accordingly the next Day, I went to my Country-House, as I call'd it,
and cutting some of the smaller Twigs, I found them to my Purpose as much
as I could desire; whereupon I came the next Time prepar'd with a Hatchet
to cut down a Quantity, which I soon found, for there was great Plenty
of them; these I set up to dry within my Circle or Hedge, and when they
were fit for Use, I carry'd them to my Cave, and here during the next Season,
I employ'd my self in making, <I>as well as I could</I>, a great many Baskets,
both to carry Earth, or to carry or lay up any Thing as I had occasion;
and tho' I did not finish them very handsomly, yet I made them sufficiently
serviceable for my Purpose; and thus afterwards I took Care never to be
without them; and as my <I>Wicker-ware</I> decay'd, I made more, especially,
I made strong deep Baskets to place my Corn in, instead of Sacks, when
I should come to have any Quantity of it.

<P>Having master'd this Difficulty, and employ'd a World of Time about
it, I bestirr'd my self to see if possible how to supply two Wants: I had
no Vessels to hold any Thing that was Liquid, except two Runlets which
were almost full of Rum, and some Glass-Bottles, some of the common Size,
and others which were Case-Bottles square, for the holding of Waters, Spirits,
<I>etc.</I> I had not so much as a Pot to boil any Thing, except a great
Kettle, which I sav'd out of the Ship, and which was too big for such Use
as I desir'd it, <I>viz.</I> To make Broth, and stew a Bit of Meat by it
self. The Second Thing I would fain have had, was a Tobacco-Pipe; but it
was impossible to me to make one, however, I found a Contrivance for that
too at last.

<P>I employ'd my self in Planting my Second Rows of Stakes or Piles and
in this <I>Wicker</I> working all the Summer, or dry Season, when another
Business took me up more Time than it could be imagin'd I could spare.

<P>I mention'd before, That I had a great Mind to see the whole Island,
and that I had travell'd up the Brook, and so on to where I built my Bower,
and where I had an Opening quite to the Sea on the other Side of the Island;
I now resolv'd to travel quite Cross to the Sea-Shore on that Side; so
taking my Gun, a Hatchet, and my Dog, and a larger Quantity of Powder and
Shot than usual, with two Bisket Cakes, and a great Bunch of Raisins in
my Pouch for my Store, I began my Journey; when I had pass'd the Vale where
my Bower stood as above, I came within View of the Sea, to the <I>West</I>,
and it being a very clear Day, I fairly descry'd Land, whether an Island
or a Continent, I could not tell; but it lay very high, extending from
the <I>West</I>, to the <I>W. S. W.</I> at a very great Distance; by my
Guess it could not be less than Fifteen or Twenty Leagues off.

<P>I could not tell what Part of the World this might be, otherwise than
that I know it must be Part of <I>America</I>, and as I concluded by all
my Observations, must be near the <I>Spanish</I> Dominions, and perhaps
was all Inhabited by Savages, where if I should have landed, I had been
in a worse Condition than I was now; and therefore I acquiesced in the
Dispositions of Providence, which I began now to own, and to believe, order'd
every Thing for the best; I say, I quieted my Mind with this, and left
afflicting my self with Fruitless Wishes of being there.

<P>Besides, after some Pause upon this Affair, I consider'd, that if this
Land was the <I>Spanish</I> Coast, I should certainly, one Time or other,
see some Vessel pass or re-pass one Way or other; but if not, then it was
the <I>Savage</I> Coast between the Spanish Country and <I>Brasils</I>,
which are indeed the worst of Savages; for they are Cannibals, or Men-eaters,
and fail not to murther and devour all the humane Bodies that fall into
their Hands.

<P>With these Considerations I walk'd very leisurely forward, I found that
Side of the Island where I now was, much pleasanter than mine, the open
or <I>Savanna</I> Fields sweet, adorn'd with Flowers and Grass, and full
of very fine Woods. I saw Abundance of Parrots, and fain I would have caught
one, if possible to have kept it to be tame, and taught it to speak to
me. I did, after some Pains taking, catch a young Parrot, for I knock'd
it down with a Stick, and having' recover'd it, I brought it home; but
it was some Years before I could make him speak: However, at last I taught
him to call me by my Name very familiarly: But the Accident that follow'd,
tho' it be a Trifle, will be very diverting in its Place.

<P>I was exceedingly diverted with this Journey: I found in the low Grounds
Hares, as I thought them to be, and Foxes, but they differ'd greatly from
all the other Kinds I had met with; nor could I satisfy my self to eat
them, tho' I kill'd several: But I had no Need to be ventrous; for I had
no Want of Food, and of that which was very good too; especially these
three Sorts, <I>viz.</I>Goats, Pidgeons, and Turtle or Tortoise; which,
added to my Grapes, <I>Leaden-hall</I> Market could not have furnish'd
a Table better than I, in Proportion to the Company; and tho' my Cafe was
deplorable enough, yet I had great Cause for Thankfulness, that I was not
driven to any Extremities for Food; but rather Plenty, even to Dainties.

<P>I never travell'd in this Journey above two Miles outright in a Day,
or thereabouts; but I took so many Turns and Returns, to see what Discoveries
I could make, that I came weary enough to the Place where I resolv'd to
sit down for all Night; and then I either repos'd my self in a Tree, or
surrounded my self with a Row of Stakes set upright in the Ground, either
from one Tree to another, or so as no wild Creature could come at me, without
Waking me.

<P>As soon as I came to the Sea Shore, I was surpriz'd to see that I had
taken up my Lot on the worst Side of the Island; for here indeed the Shore
was cover'd with innumerable Turtles, whereas on the other Side I had found
but three in a Year and half. Here was also an infinite Number of Fowls,
of many Kinds, some which I had seen, and some which I had not seen of
before, and many of them very good Meat; but such as I knew not the Names
of, except those call'd <I>Penguins</I>.

<P>I could have shot as many as I pleas'd, but was very sparing of my Powder
and Shot; and therefore had more Mind to kill a she Goat, if I could, which
I could better feed on; and though there were many Goats here more than
on my Side the Island, yet it was with much more Difficulty that I could
come near them, the Country being flat and even, and they saw me much sooner
than when I was on the Hill.

<P>I confess this Side of the Country was much pleasanter than mine, but
yet I had not the least Inclination to remove; for as I was fix'd in my
Habitation, it became natural to me, and I seem'd all the while I was here,
to be as it were upon a Journey, and from Home: However, I travell'd along
the Shore of the Sea, towards the <I>East</I>, I suppose about twelve Miles;
and the setting up a great Pole upon the Shore for a Mark, I concluded
I would go Home again; and that the next Journey I took should be on the
other Side of the Island, East from my Dwelling, and so round till I came
to my Post again: Of which in its Place.

<P>I took another Way to come back than that I went, thinking I could easily
keep all the Island so much in my View, that I could not miss finding my
first Dwelling by viewing the Country; but I found my self mistaken; for
being come about two or three Miles, I found my self descended into a very
large Valley; but so surrounded with Hills, and those Hills cover'd with
Wood, that I could not see which was my Way by any Direction but that of
the Sun, nor even then, unless I knew very well the Position of the Sun
at that Time of the Day.

<P>It happen'd to my farther Misfortune, That the Weather prov'd hazey
for three or four Days, while was in this Valley; and not being able to
see the Sun, I wander'd about very uncomfortably, and at last was oblig'd
to find out the Sea Side, look for my Post, and come back the same Way
I went; and then by easy Journies I turn'd Homeward, the Weather being
exceeding hot, and my Gun, Ammunition, Hatchet, and other Things very heavy.

<P>In this Journey my Dog surpriz'd a young Kid, and seiz'd upon it, and
I running in to take hold of it, caught it, and sav'd it alive from the
Dog: I had a great Mind to bring it Home if I could; for I had often been
musing, Whether it might not be possible to get a Kid or two, and so raise
a Breed of tame Goats, which might supply me when my Powder and Shot should
be all spent.

<P>I made a Collar to this little Creature, and with a String which I made
of some Rope-Yarn, which I always carry'd about me, I led him along, tho'
with some Difficulty, till I came to my Bower, and there I enclos'd him,
and left him; for I was very impatient to be at Home, from whence I had
been absent above a Month.

<P>I cannot express what a Satisfaction it was to me, to come into my old
Hutch, and lye down in my Hamock-Bed: This little wandring Journey, without
settled Place of Abode, had been so unpleasant to me, that my own House,
as I call'd it to my self, was a perfect Settlement to me, compar'd to
that; and it rendred every Thing about me so comfortable, that I resolv'd
I would never go a great Way from it again, while it should be my Lot to
stay on the Island.

<P>I repos'd my self here a Week, to rest and regale my self after my long
Journey; during which, most of the Time was taken up in the weighty Affair
of making a Cage for my Poll, who began now to be a meer Domestick, and
to be mighty well acquainted with me. Then I began to think of the poor
Kid, which I had penn'd in within my little Circle, and resolv'd to go
and fetch it Home, or give it some Food; accordingly I went, and found
it where I left it; for indeed it could not get out, but almost starv'd
for want of Food: I went and cut Bows of Trees, and Branches of such Shrubs
as I could find, and threw it over, and having fed it, I ty'd it as I did
before, to lead it away; but it was so tame with being hungry, that I had
no need to have ty'd it; for it follow'd me like a Dog; and as I continually
fed it, the Creature became so loving, so gentle, and so fond, that it
became from that Time one of my Domesticks also, and would never leave
me afterwards.

<P>The rainy Season of the <I>Autumnal Equinox</I> was now come, and I
kept the 30th of <I>Sept.</I> in the same solemn Manner as before, being
the Anniversary of my Landing on the Island, having now been there two
Years, and no more Prospect of being deliver'd, than the first Day I came
there. I spent the whole Day in humble and thankful Acknowledgments of
the many wonderful Mercies which my Solitary Condition was attended with,
and without which it might have been infinitely more miserable. I gave
humble and hearty Thanks that God had been pleas'd to discover to me, even
that it was possible I might be more happy in this Solitary Condition,
than I should have been in a Liberty of Society, and in all the Pleasures
of the World. That he could fully make up to me, the Deficiencies of my
Solitary State, and the want of Humane Society by his Presence, and the
Communications of his Grace to my Soul, supporting, comforting, and encouraging
me to depend upon his Providence here, and hope for his Eternal Presence
hereafter.

<P>It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more happy this Life
I now led was, with all its miserable Circumstances, than the wicked, cursed,
abominable Life I led all the past Part of my Days; and now I chang'd both
my Sorrows and my Joys; my very Desires alter'd, my Affections chang'd
their Gusts, land my Delights were perfectly new, from what they were at
my first Coming, or indeed for the two Years past.

<P>Before, as I walk'd about, either on, my Hunting, or for viewing the
Country, the Anguish of my Soul at my Condition, would break out upon me
on a sudden, and my very Heart would die within me, to think of the Woods,
the Mountains, the Desarts I was in; and how I was a Prisoner lock'd up
with the Eternal Bars and Bolts of the Ocean, in an uninhabited Wilderness,
without Redemption: In the midst of the greatest Composures of my Mind,
this would break out upon me like a Storm, and make me wring my Hands,
and weep like a Child: Sometimes it would take me in the middle of my Work,
and I would immediately sit down and sigh, and look upon the Ground for
an Hour or -two together; and this was still worse to me; for if I could
burst out into Tears, or vent my self by Words, it would go off, and the
Grief having exhausted it self would abate.

<P>But now I began to exercise my self with new Thoughts; I daily read
the Word of God, and apply'd all the Comforts of it to my present State:
One Morning being very sad, I open'd the Bible upon these Words, <I>I will
never, never leave thee, nor forsake thee</I>; immediately it occurr'd,
That these Words were to me, Why else should they be directed in such a
Manner, just at the Moment when I was mourning over my Condition, as one
forsaken of God and Man? Well then, said I, if God does not forsake me,
of what ill Consequence can it be, or what matters it, though the World
should all forsake me, seeing on the other Hand, if I had all the World,
and should lose the Favour and Blessing of God, there wou'd be no Comparison
in the Loss.

<P>From this Moment I began to conclude in my Mind, That it was possible
for me to be more happy in this forsaken Solitary Condition, than it was
probable I should ever have been in any other Particular State in the World;
and with this Thought I was going to give Thanks to God for bringing me
to this Place.

<P>I know not what it was, but something shock'd my Mind at that Thought,
and I durst not speak the Words: How canst thou be such a Hypocrite, (said
I, even audibly) to pretend to be thankful for a Condition, which however
thou mav'st endeavour to be contented with, thou would'st rather pray heartily
to be deliver'd from; so I stopp'd there: But though I could not say, I
thank'd God for being there; yet I sincerely gave Thanks to God for opening
my Eyes, by whatever afflicting Providences, to see the former Condition
of my Life, and to mourn for my Wickedness, and repent. I never open'd
the Bible, or shut it, but my very Soul within me, bless'd God for directing
my Friend in <I>England</I>, without any Order of mine, to pack it up among
my Goods; and for assisting me afterwards to save it out of the Wreck of
the Ship.

<P>Thus, and in this Disposition of Mind, I began my third Year: and tho'
I have not given the Reader the Trouble of so particular Account of my
Works this Year as the first; yet in General it may be observ'd, That I
was very seldom idle; but having regularly divided my Time, according to
the several daily Employments that were before me, such as, <I>First</I>,
My Duty to God, and the Reading the Scriptures, which I constantly set
apart some Time for thrice every Day. <I>Secondly</I>, The going Abroad
with my Gun for Food, which generally took me up three Hours in every Morning,
when it did not Rain. <I>Thirdly</I>, The ordering, curing, preserving,
and cooking what I had kill'd or catch'd for my Supply; these took up great
Part of the Day; also it is to be considered that the middle of the Day
when the Sun was in the <I>Zenith</I>, the Violence of the Heat was too
great to stir out; so that about four Hours in the Evening was all the
Time I could be suppos'd to work in; with this Exception, That sometimes
I chang'd my Hours of Hunting and Working, and went to work in the Morning,
and Abroad with my Gun in the Afternoon.

<P>To this short Time allow'd for Labour, I desire may be added the exceeding
Laboriousness of my Work; the many Hours which for want of Tools, want
of Help, and want of Skill, every Thing I did, took up out of my Time:
For Example, I was full two and forty Days making me a Board for a long
Shelf, which I wanted in my Cave; whereas two Sawyers with their Tools,
and a Saw-Pit, would have cut six of them out of the same Tree in half
a Day.

<P>My Case was this, It was to be a large Tree, which was to be cut down,
because my Board was to be a broad one. This Tree I was three Days a cutting
down, and two more cutting off the Bows, and reducing it to a Log, or Piece
of Timber. With inexpressible hacking and hewing I reduc'd both the Sides
of it into Chips, till it begun to be light enough to move; then I turn'd
it, and made one Side of it smooth, and flat, as a Board from End to End;
then turning that Side downward, cut the other Side, till I brought the
plank to be about three Inches thick, and smooth on both Sides. Any One
may judge the Labour of my Hands in such a Piece of Work; but Labour and
Patience carry'd me through that and many other Things: I only observe
this in Particular, to shew, The Reason why so much of my Time went away
with so little Work, <I>viz.</I>That what might be a little to be done
with Help and Tools, was a vast Labour, and requir'd a prodigious Time
to do alone, and by hand.

<P>But notwithstanding this, with Patience and Labour I went through many
Things; and indeed every Thing that my Circumstances made necessary to
me to do, as will appear by what follows.

<P>I was now, in the Months of <I>November</I> and <I>December</I>, expecting
my Crop of Barley and Rice. The Ground I had manur'd or dug up for them
was not great; for as I observ'd, my Seed of each was not above the Quantity
of half a Peck; for I had lost one whole Crop by sowing in the dry Season;
but now my Crop promis'd very well, when on a sudden I found I was in Danger
of losing it all again by Enemies of several Sorts, which it was scarce
possible to keep from it; as First, The Goats, and wild Creatures which
I call'd Hares who tasting the Sweetness of the Blade, lay in it Night
and Day, as soon as it came up, and eat it so close, that it could get
no Time to shoot up into Stalk.

<P>This I saw no Remedy for, but by making an Enclosure about it with a
Hedge, which I did with a great deal of Toil; and the more, because it
requir'd Speed. However, as my Arable Land was but small, suited to my
Crop, I got it totally well fenc'd, in about three Weeks Time; and shooting
some of the Creatures in the Day Time, I set my Dog to guard it in the
Night, tying him up to a Stake at the Gate, where he would stand and bark
all Night long; so in a little Time the Enemies forsook the Place, and
the Corn grew very strong, and well, and began to ripen apace.

<P>But as the Beasts ruined me before, while my Corn was in the Blade;
so the Birds were as likely to ruin me now, when it was in the Ear; for
going along by the Place to see how it throve, I saw my little Crop surrounded
with Fowls of I know not how many Sorts, who stood as it were watching
till I should be gone: I immediately let fly among them (for I always had
my Gun with me) I had no sooner shot, but there rose up a little Cloud
of Fowls, which I had not seen at all, from among the Corn it self.

<P>This touch'd me sensibly, for I foresaw, that in a few Days they would
devour all my Hopes, that I should be starv'd, and never be able to raise
a Crop at all, and what to do I could not tell: However I resolv'd not
to loose my Corn, if possible, tho' I should watch it Night and Day. In
the first Place, I went among it to see what Damage was already done, and
found they had spoil'd a good deal of it, but that as it was yet too Green
for them, the Loss was not so great, but that the Remainder was like to
be a good Crop if it could be sav'd.

<P>I staid by it to load my Gun, and then coming away I could easily see
the Thieves sitting upon all the Trees about me, as if they only waited
till I was gone away, and the Event proved it to be so; for as I walk'd
off as if I was gone, I was no sooner out of their sight, but they dropt
down one by one into the Corn again. I was so provok'd that I could not
have Patience to stay till more came on, knowing that every Grain that
they eat now, was, <I>as it might be said</I>, a Peck-loaf to me in the
Consequence; but coming up to the Hedge, I fir'd again, and kill'd three
of them. This was what I wish'd for; so I took them up, and serv'd them
as we serve notorious Thieves in <I>England</I>, (<I>viz.</I>) Hang'd them
in Chains for a Terror to others; it is impossible to imagine almost, that
this should have such an Effect, as it had; for the Fowls wou'd not only
not come at the Corn, but in short they forsook all that Part of the Island,
and I could never see a Bird near the Place as long as my Scare-Crows hung
there.

<P>This I was very glad of, you may be sure, and about the latter end of
<I>December</I>, which was our second Harvest of the Year, I reap'd my
Crop.

<P>I was sadly put to it for a Scythe or a Sicle to cut it down, and-all
I could do was to make one as well as I could out of one of the Broad Swords
or Cutlasses, which I sav'd among the Arms out of the Ship. However, as
my first Crop was but small I had no great Difficulty to cut it down; in
short, I reap'd it my Way, for I cut nothing off but the Ears, and carry'd
it away in a great Basket which I had made, and so rubb'd it out with my
Hands; and at the End of all my Harvesting, I found that out of my half
Peck of Seed, I had near two Bushels of Rice, and above two Bushels and
half of Barley, <I>that is to say</I>, by my Guess, for I had no Measure
at that time.

<P>However, this was a great Encouragement to me, and I foresaw that in
time, it wou'd please God to supply me with Bread: And yet here I was perplex'd
again, for I neither knew how to grind or make Meal of my Corn, or indeed
how to clean it and part it; nor if made into Meal, how to make Bread of
it, and if how to make it, yet I knew not how to bake it; these things
being added to my Desire of having a good Quantity for Store, and to secure
a constant Supply, I resolv'd not to taste any of this Crop but to preserve
it all for Seed against the next Season, and in the mean time to employ
all my Study and Hours of Working to accomplish this great Work of Providing
my self with Corn and Bread.

<P>It might be truly said, that now I work'd for my Bread; 'tis a little
wonderful, and what I believe few People have thought much upon, (viz.)
the strange multitude of little Things necessary in the Providing, Producing,
Curing, Dressing, Making and Finishing this one Article of Bread.

<P>I that was reduced to a meer State of Nature, found this to my daily
Discouragement, and was made more and more sensible of it every Hour, even
after I had got the first Handful of Seed-Corn, which, as I have said,
came up unexpectedly, and indeed to a surprize.

<P>First, I had no Plow to turn up the Earth, no Spade or Shovel to dig
it. Well, this I conquer'd, by making a wooden Spade, as I observ'd before;
but this did my Work in but a wooden manner, and tho' it cost me a great
many Days to make it, yet for want of Iron it not only wore out the sooner,
but made my Work the harder, and made it be perform'd much worse.

<P>However this I bore with, and was content to work it out with Patience,
and bear with the badness of the Performance. When the Corn was sow'd,
I had no Harrow, but was forced to go over it my self and drag a great
heavy Bough of a Tree over it, to Scratch it, as it may be call'd, rather
than Rake or Harrow it.

<P>When it was growing and grown, I have observ'd already, how many things
I wanted, to Fence it, Secure it, Mow or Reap it, Cure and Carry it Home,
Thrash, Part it from the Chaff, and Save it. Then I wanted a Mill to Grind
it, Sieves to Dress it, Yeast and Salt to make it into Bread, and an Oven
to bake it, and yet all these things I did without, as shall be observ'd;
and yet the Corn was an inestimable Comfort and Advantage to me too. All
this, as I said, made every thing laborious and tedious to me, but that
there was no help for; neither was my time so much Loss to me, because
as I had divided it, a certain Part of it was every Day appointed to these
Works; and as I resolv'd to use none of the Corn for Bread till I had a
greater Quantity by me, I had the next six Months to apply my self wholly
by Labour and Invention to furnish my self with Utensils proper for the
performing all the Operations necessary for the making the Corn (when I
had it) fit for my use.

<P>But first, I was to prepare more Land, for I had now Seed enough to
sow above an Acre of Ground. Before I did this, I had a Week's-work at
least to make me a Spade, which when it was done was but a sorry one indeed,
and very heavy, and requir'd double Labour to work with it; however I went
thro' that, and sow'd my Seed in two large flat Pieces of Ground, as near
my House as I could find them to my Mind, and fenc'd them in with a good
Hedge, the Stakes of which were all cut of that Wood which I had set before,
and knew it would grow, so that in one Year's time I knew I should have
a Quick or Living-Hedge, that would want but little Repair. This Work was
not so little as to take me up less than three Months, because great Part
of that time was of the wet Season, when I could not go abroad.

<P>Within Doors, <I>that is</I>, when it rained, and I could not go out,
I found Employment on the following Occasions; always observing, that all
the while I was at work I diverted my self with talking to my Parrot, and
teaching him to Speak, and I quickly learn'd him to know his own Name,
and at last to speak it out pretty loud P O L, which was the first Word
I ever heard spoken in the Island by any Mouth but my own. This therefore
was not my Work, but an assistant to my Work, for now, as I said, I had
a great Employment upon my Hands, as follows, (<I>viz.</I>) I had long
study'd by some Means or other, to make my self some Earthen Vessels, which
indeed I wanted sorely, but knew not where to come at them: However, considering
the Heat of the Climate, I did not doubt but if I could find out any such
Clay, I might botch up some such Pot, as might, being dry'd in the Sun,
be hard enough, and strong enough to bear handling, and to hold any Thing
that was dry, and requir'd to be kept so; and as this was necessary in
the preparing Corn, Meal, <I>etc.</I> which was the Thing I was upon, I
resolv'd to make some as large as I could, and fit only to stand like Jarrs
to hold what should be put into them.

<P>It would make the Reader pity me, or rather laugh at me, to tell how
many awkward ways I took to raise this Paste, what odd mishapen ugly things
I made, how many of them fell in, and how many fell out, the Clay not being
stiff enough to bear its own Weight; how many crack'd by the over violent
Heat of the Sun, being set out too hastily; and how many fell in pieces
with only removing, as well before as after they were dry'd; and in a word,
how after having labour'd hard to find the Clay, to dig it, to temper it,
to bring it home and work it; I could not make above two large earthern
ugly things, I cannot call them Jarrs, in about two Months Labour.

<P>However, as the Sun bak'd these Two, very dry and hard, I lifted them
very gently up, and set them down again in two great Wicker-Baskets which
I had made on purpose for them, that they might not break, and as between
the Pot and the Basket there was a little room to spare, I stuff'd it full
of the Rice and Barley Straw, and these two Pots being to stand always
dry, I thought would hold my dry Corn, and perhaps the Meal, when the Corn
was bruised.

<P>Tho' I miscarried so much in my Design for large Pots, yet I made several
smaller things with better Success, such as little round Pots, flat Dishes,
Pitchers and Pipkins, and any things my Hand turn'd to, and the Heat of
the Sun bak'd them strangely hard.

<P>But all this would not answer my End, which was to get an earthen Pot
to hold what was Liquid, and bear the Fire, which none of these could do.
It happen'd after some time, making a pretty large Fire for cooking my
Meat, when I went to put it out after I had done with it, I found a broken
Piece of one of my Earthen-ware Vessels in the Fire, burnt as hard as a
Stone, and red as a Tile. I was agreeably suppris'd to see it, and said
to my self, that certainly they might be made to burn whole if they would
burn broken.

<P>This set me to studying how to order my Fire, so as to make it burn
me some Pots. I had no Notion of a Kiln, such as the Potters burn in, or
of glazing them with Lead, tho' I had Some Lead to do it with; but I plac'd
three large Pipkins, and two or three Pots in a Pile one upon another,
and plac'd my Fire-wood all round it with a great Heap of Embers under
them, I ply'd the Fire with fresh Fuel round the out-side, and upon the
top, till I saw the Pots in the inside red hot quite thro', and observ'd
that they did not crack at all; when I saw them clear red, I let them stand
in that Heat about 5 or 6 Hours, till I found one of them, tho' it did
not crack, did melt or run, for the Sand which was mixed with the Clay
melted by the violence of the Heat, and would have run into Glass if I
had gone on, so I slack'd my Fire gradually till the Pots began to abate
of the red Colour, and watching them all Night, that I might not let the
Fire abate too fast, in the Morning I had three very good, I will not say
handsome Pipkins; and two other Earthen Pots, as hard burnt as cou'd be
desir'd; and one of them perfectly glaz'd with the Running of the Sand.

<P>After this Experiment, I need not say that I wanted no sort of Earthen
Ware for my Use; but I must needs say, as to the Shapes of them, they were
very indifferent, as any one may suppose, when I had no way of making them;
but as the Children make Dirt-Pies, Or as a Woman would make Pies, that
never learn'd to raise Past.

<P>No Joy at a Thing of so mean a Nature was ever equal to mine, when I
found I had made an Earthen Pot that would bear the Fire; and I had hardly
Patience to stay till they were cold, before I set one upon the Fire again,
with some Water in it, to boil me some Meat, which it did admirably well;
and with a Piece of a Kid, I made Some very good Broth, though I wanted
Oatmeal, and several other Ingredients, requisite to make it so good as
I would have had it been.

<P>My next Concern was, to get me a Stone Mortar, to stamp or beat some
Corn in; for as to the Mill, there was no thought at arriving to that Perfection
of Art, with one Pair of Hands. To supply this Want I was at a great Loss;
for of all Trades in the World I was as perfectly unqualify'd for a Stone-cutter,
as for any whatever; neither had I any Tools to go about it with. I spent
many a Day to find out a great Stone big enough to cut hollow, and make
fit for a Mortar, and could find none at all; except what was in the solid
Rock, and which I had no way to dig or cut out; nor indeed were the Rocks
in the Island of Hardness sufficient, but were all of a sandy crumbling
Stone, which neither would bear the Weight of a heavy Pestle, or would
break the Corn without filling it with Sand; so after a great deal of Time
lost in searching for a Stone, I gave it over, and resolv'd to look out
for a great Block of hard Wood, which I found indeed much easier; and getting
one as big as I had Strength to stir, I rounded it, and form'd it in the
Out-side with my Axe and Hatchet, and then with the Help of Fire, and infinite
Labour, made a hollow Place in it, as the Indians in <I>Brasil</I> make
their <I>Canoes</I>. After this, I made a great heavy Pestle or Beater,
of the Wood call'd the Iron-wood, and this I prepar'd and laid by against
I had my next Crop of Corn, when I propos'd to my self, to grind, or rather
pound my into Meal to make my Bread.

<P>My next Difficulty was to make a Sieve, or Search,' to dress my Meal,
and to part it from the Bran, and the Husk, without which I did not see
it possible I could have any Bread. This was a most difficult Thing, so
much as but to think on; for to be sure I had nothing like the necessary
Thing to make it; I mean fine thin Canvas, or Stuff, to search the Meal
through. And here I was at a full Stop for many Months; nor did I really
know what to do; Linnen I had none left, but what was meer Rags; I had
Goats Hair, but neither knew I how to weave it, or spin it; and had I known
how, here was no Tools to work it with; all the Remedy that I found for
this, was, That at last I did remember I had among the Seamens Cloaths
which were sav'd out of the Ship, some Neckcloths of Callicoe, or Muslin;
and with some Pieces of these, I made three small Sieves, but proper enough
for the Work; and thus I made shift for some Years; how I did afterwards,
I shall shew in its Place.

<P>The baking Part was the next Thing to be consider'd, and how I should
make Bread when I came to have Corn; for first I had no Yeast; as to that
Part, as there was no supplying the Want, so I did not concern my self
much about it: But for an Oven, I was indeed in great Pain; at length I
found out an Experiment for that also, which was this; I made some Earthen
Vessels very broad, but not deep; that is to say, about two Foot Diameter,
and not above nine Inches deep; these I burnt in the Fire, as I had done
the other, and laid them by; and when I wanted to bake, I made a great
Fire upon my Hearth, which I had pav'd with some square Tiles of my own
making, and burning also; but I should not call them square.

<P>When the Fire-wood was burnt pretty much into Embers, or live Coals,
I drew them forward upon this Hearth, so as to cover it all over, and there
I let them lye, till the Hearth was very hot, then sweeping away all the
Embers, I set down my Loaf, or Loaves, and whelming down the Earthen Pot
upon them, drew the Embers all round the Out-side of the Pot, to keep in,
and add to the Heat; and thus, as well as in the best Oven in the World,
I bak'd my Barley Loaves, and became in little Time a meer Pastry-Cook
into the Bargain; for I made my self several Cakes of the Rice, and Puddings;
indeed I made no Pies, neither had I any Thing to put into them, supposing
I had, except the Flesh either of Fowls or Goats.

<P>It need not be wondred at, if all these Things took me up most Part
of the third Year of my Abode here; for it is to be observ'd, That in the
Intervals of these Things, I had my new Harvest and Husbandry to manage;
for I reap'd my Corn in its Season, and carry'd it Home as well as I could,
and laid it up in the Ear, in my large Baskets, till I had Time to rub
it out; for I had no Floor to thrash it on, or Instrument to thrash it
with.

<P>And now indeed my Stock of Corn increasing, I really wanted to build
my Barns bigger. I wanted a Place to lay it up in; for the Increase of
the Corn now yielded me so much, that I had of the Barley about twenty
Bushels, and of the Rice as much, or more; insomuch, that now I resolv'd
to begin to use it freely; for my Bread had been quite gone a great while;
Also I resolved to see what Quantity would be sufficient for me a whole
Year, and to sow but once a Year.

<P>Upon the whole, I found that the forty Bushels of Barley and Rice, was
much more than I could consume in a Year; so I resolv'd to sow just the
same Quantity every Year, that I sow'd the last, in Hopes that such a Quantity
would fully provide me with Bread, <I>etc.</I>

<P>All the while these Things were doing, you may be sure my Thoughts run
many times upon the Prospect of Land which I had seen from the other Side
of the Island, and I was not without secret Wishes that I were on Shore
there, fancying the seeing the main Land, and in an inhabited Country,
I might find some Way or other to convey my self farther, and perhaps at
last find some Means of Escape.

<P>But all this while I made no Allowance for the Dangers of such a Condition,
and how I might fall into the Hands of Savages, and perhaps such as I might
have Reason to think far worse than the Lions and Tigers of <I>Africa</I>.
That if I once came into their Power, I should run a Hazard more than a
thousand to one of being kill'd, and perhaps of being eaten; for I had
heard that the People of the <I>Carribean</I> Coast were Canibals, or Man-eaters;
and I knew by the Latitude that I could not be far off from that Shore.
That suppose they were not Canibals, yet that they might kill me, as many
<I>Europeans</I> who had fallen into their Hands had been serv'd, even
when they had been ten or twenty together; much more I' that was but one,
and could make little or no Defence: All these Things, I say, which I ought
to have consider'd well of, and did cast up in my Thoughts afterwards,
yet took up none of my Apprehensions at first; but my Head run mightily
upon the Thought of getting over to the Shore.

<P>Now I wish'd for my Boy <I>Xury</I>, and the long Boat, with the Shoulder
of Mutton Sail, with which I sail'd above a thousand Miles on the Coast
of <I>Africk</I>; but this was In vain. Then I thought I would go and look
at our Ship's Boat, which, as I have said, was blown up upon the Shore,
a great Way in the Storm, when we were first cast away. She lay almost
where she did at first, but not quite; and was turn'd by the Force of the
Waves and the Winds almost Bottom upward, against a high Ridge of Beachy
rough Sand; but no Water about her as before.

<P>If I had had Hands to have refitted her, and to have launch'd her into
the Water, the Boat would have done well enough, and I might have gone
back into the <I>Brasils</I> with her easily enough; but I might have foreseen,
That I could no more turn her, and set her upright upon her Bottom, than
I could remove the Island: However, I went to the Woods, and cut Levers
and Rollers, and brought them to the Boat, resolv'd to try what I could
do, suggesting to my self, That if I could but turn her down, I might easily
repair the Damage she had receiv'd, and she would be a very good Boat,
and I might go to Sea in her very easily.

<P>I spar'd no Pains indeed, in this Piece of fruitless Toil, and spent,
I think, three or four Weeks about it; at last finding it impossible to
heave it up with my little Strength, I fell to digging away the Sand, to
undermine it, and so to make it fall down, setting Pieces of Wood to thrust
and guide it right in the Fall.

<P>But when I had done this, I was unable to stir it up again, or to get
under it, much less to move it forward, towards the Water; so I was forc'd
to give it over; and yet, though I gave over the Hopes of the Boat, my
desire to venture over for the Main increased, rather than decreased, as
the Means for it seem'd impossible.

<P>This at length put me upon thinking, Whether it was not possible to
make my self a <I>Canoe</I>, or <I>Periagua</I>, such as the Natives of
those Climates make, even without Tools, or, as I might say, without Hands,
<I>viz</I>. of the Trunk of a great Tree. This I not only thought possible,
but easy, and pleas'd my self extreamly with the Thoughts of making it,
and with my having much more Convenience for it than any of the <I>Negroes</I>
or <I>Indians</I>; but not at all considering the particular Inconveniences
which I lay under, more than the Indians did, <I>viz.</I>Want of Hands
to move it, when it was made, into the Water, a Difficulty much harder
for me to surmount, than all the Consequences of Want of Tools could be
to them; for what was it to me, That when I had chosen a vast Tree in the
Woods, I might with much Trouble cut it down, if after I might be able
with my Tools to hew and dub the Out-side into the proper Shape of a Boat,
and burn or cut out the In-side to make it hollow, so to make a Boat of
it: If after all this, I must leave it just there where I found it, and
was not able to launch it into the Water.

<P>One would have thought, I could not have had the least Reflection upon
my Mind of my Circumstance, while I was making this Boat; but I should
have immediately thought how I should get it into the Sea; but my Thoughts
were so intent upon my Voyage over the Sea in it, that I never once consider'd
how I should get it off of the Land; and it was really in its own Nature
more easy for me to guide it over forty five Miles of Sea, than about forty
five Fathom of Land, where it lay, to set it a float in the Water.

<P>I went to work upon this Boat, the most like a Fool, that ever Man did,
who had any of his Senses awake. I pleas'd my self with the Design, without
determining whether I was ever able to undertake it; not but that the Difficulty
of launching my Boat came often into my Head; but I put a stop to my own
Enquiries into it, by this foolish Answer which I gave my self, <I>Let's
first make it, I'll warrant I'll find some Way or other to get it along,
when 'tis done</I>.

<P>This was a most preposterous Method; but the Eagerness of my Fancy prevail'd,
and to work I went. I fell'd a Cedar Tree: I question much whether <I>Solomon</I>
ever had such a One for the Building of the Temple at <I>Jerusalem</I>.
It was five Foot ten Inches Diameter at the lower Part next the Stump,
and four Foot eleven Inches Diameter at the End of twenty two Foot, after
which it lessen'd for a while, and then parted into Branches: It was not
without infinite Labour that I fell'd this Tree: I was twenty Days hacking
and hewing at it at the Bottom. I was fourteen more getting the Branches
and Limbs, and the vast' spreading Head of it cut off, which I hack'd and
hew'd through with Axe and Hatchet, and inexpressible Labour: After this,
it cost me a Month to shape it, and dub it to a Proportion, and to something
like the Bottom of a Boat, that it might swim upright as it ought to do.
It cost me near three Months more to clear the In-side, and work it out
so, as to make an exact Boat of it: This I did indeed without Fire, by
meer Malett and Chissel, and by the dint of hard Labour, till I had brought
it to be a very handsome <I>Periagua</I>, and big enough to have carry'd
six and twenty Men, and consequently big enough to have carry'd me and
all my Cargo.

<P>When I had gone through this Work, I was extremely delighted with it.
The Boat was really much bigger than I ever saw a Canoe, or Periagua, that
was made of one Tree, in my Life. Many a weary Stroke it had cost, you
may be sure; and there remain'd nothing but to get it into the Water; and
had I gotten it into the Water, I make no question but I should have began
the maddest Voyage, and the most unlikely to be perform'd, that ever was
undertaken.

<P>But all my Devices to get it into the Water fail'd me; tho' they cost
me infinite Labour too. It lay about one hundred Yards from the Water,
and not more: But the first Inconvenience was, it was up Hill towards the
Creek; well, to take away this Discouragement, I resolv'd to dig into the
Surface of the Earth, and so make a Declivity: This I begun, and it cost
me a prodigious deal of Pains; but who grutches Pains, that have their
Deliverance in View: But then this was work'd through, and this Difficulty
manag'd, it was still much at one; for I could no more stir the <I>Canoe</I>,
than I could the other Boat.

<P>Then I measur'd the Distance of Ground, and resolv'd to cut a Dock,
or Canal, to bring the Water up to the <I>Canoe</I>, seeing I could not
bring the <I>Canoe</I> down to the Water: Well, I began this Work, and
when I began to enter into it, and calculate how deep it was to be dug,
how broad, how the Stuff to be thrown out, I found, That by the Number
of Hands I had, being none but my own, it must have been ten or twelve
Years before I should have gone through with it; for the Shore lay high,
so that at the upper End, it must have been at least twenty Foot Deep;
so at length, tho' with great Reluctancy, I gave this Attempt over also.

<P>This griev'd me heartily, and now I saw, tho' too late, the Folly of
beginning a Work before we count the Cost; and before we judge rightly
of our own Strength to go through with it.

<P>In the middle of this Work, I finish'd my fourth Year in this Place,
and kept my Anniversary with the same Devotion, and with as much Comfort
as ever before; for by a constant Study, and serious Application of the
Word of God, and by the Assistance of his Grace, I gain'd a different Knowledge
from what I had before. I entertain'd different Notions of Things. I look'd
now upon the World as a Thing remote, which I had nothing to do with, no
Expectation from, and indeed no Desires about: In a Word, I had nothing
indeed to do with it, nor was ever like to have; so I thought it look'd
as we may perhaps look upon it hereafter, <I>viz</I>. as a Place I had
liv'd in, but was come out of it; and well might I say, as Father <I>Abraham</I>
to Dives, <I>Between me and thee is a great Gulph fix'd</I>.

<P>In the first Place, I was remov'd from all the Wickedness of the World
here. I had neither the Lust of the Flesh, the <I>Lust of the Eye, or the
Pride of Life</I>. I had nothing to covet; for I had all that I was now
capable of enjoying: I was Lord of the whole Mannor; or if I pleas'd, I
might call my self King, or Emperor over the whole Country which I had
Possession of. There were no Rivals. I had no Competitor, none to dispute
Sovereignty or Command with me. I might have rais'd Ship Loadings of Corn;
but I had no use for it; so I let as little grow as I thought enough for
my Occasion.
