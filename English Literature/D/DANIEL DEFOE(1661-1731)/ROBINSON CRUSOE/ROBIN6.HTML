<P>About a Year and half after I had entertain'd these Notions, and by
long musing, had as it were resolved them all into nothing, for want of
an Occasion to put them in Execution, I was surpriz'd one Morning early,
with seeing no less than five <I>Canoes</I> all on Shore together on my
side the Island; and the People who belong'd to them all landed, and out
of my sight: The Number of them broke all my Measures, for seeing so many,
and knowing that they always came four or six, or sometimes more in a Boat,
I could not tell what to think of it, Or how to take my Measures, to attack
Twenty or Thirty Men single handed; so I lay still in my Castle, perplex'd
and discomforted: However I put my self into all the same Postures for
an Attack that I had formerly provided, and was just ready for Action,
if any Thing had presented; having waited a good while, listening to hear
if they made any Noise; at length being very impatient, I set my Guns at
the Foot of my Ladder, and clamber'd up to the Top of the Hill, by my two
Stages as usual; standing so however that my Head did not appear above
the Hill, so that they could not perceive me by any Means; here I observ'd
by the help of my Perspective Glass, that they were no less than Thirty
in Number, that they had a Fire kindled, that they had had Meat dress'd.
How they had cook'd it, that I knew not, or what it was; but they were
all Dancing in I know not how many barbarous Gestures and Figures, their
own Way, round the Fire. While I was thus looking on them, I perceived
by my Perspective, two miserable Wretches dragg'd from the Boats, where
it seems they were laid by, and were now brought out for the Slaughter.
I perceived one of them immediately fell, being knock'd down, I suppose
with a Club or Wooden Sword, for that was their way, and two or three others
were at work immediately cutting him open for their Cookery, while the
other Victim was left standing by himself, till they should be ready for
him. In that very Moment this poor Wretch seeing himself a little at Liberty,
Nature inspir'd him with Hopes of Life, and he started away from them,
and ran with incredible Swiftness along the Sands directly towards me,
I mean towards that part of the Coast, where my Habitation was.

<P>I was dreadfully frighted, (that I must acknowledge) when I perceived
him to run my Way; and especially, when as I thought I saw him pursued
by the whole Body, and now I expected that part of my Dream was coming
to pass, and that he would certainly take shelter in my Grove; but I could
not depend by any means upon my Dream for the rest Of it, (<I>viz.</I>)
that the other Savages would not pursue him thither, and find him there.
However I kept my Station, and my Spirits began to recover, when I found
that there was not above three Men that follow'd him, and still more was
I encourag'd, when I found that he outstrip'd them exceedingly in running,
and gain'd Ground of them, so that if he could but hold it for half an
Hour, I saw easily he would fairly get away from them all.

<P>There was between them and my Castle, the Creek which I mention'd often
at the first part of my Story, when I landed my Cargoes out of the Ship;
and this I saw plainly, he must necessarily swim over, or the poor Wretch
would be taken there: But when the Savage escaping came thither, he made
nothing of it, tho' the Tide was then up, but plunging in, swam thro' in
about Thirty Strokes or thereabouts, landed and ran on with exceeding Strength
and Swiftness; when the Three Persons came to the Creek, I found that Two
of them could Swim, but the Third cou'd not, and that standing on the other
Side, he look'd at the other, but went no further; and soon after went
softly back again, which as it happen'd, was very well for him in the main.

<P>I observ'd, that the two who swam, were yet more than twice as long
swimming over the Creek, as the Fellow was, that fled from them: It came
now very warmly upon my Thoughts, and indeed irresistibly, that now was
my Time to get me a Servant, and perhaps a Companion, or Assistant; and
that I was call'd plainly by Providence to save this poor Creature's Life;
I immediately run down the Ladders with all possible Expedition, fetches
my two Guns, for they were both but at the Foot of the Ladders, as I observ'd
above; and getting up again, with the same haste, to the Top of the Hill,
I cross'd toward the Sea; and having a very short Cut, and all down Hill,
clapp'd my self in the way, between the Pursuers, and the Pursu'd; hallowing
aloud to him that fled, who looking back, was at first perhaps as much
frighted at me, as at them; but I beckon'd with my Hand to him, to come
back; and in the mean time, I slowly advanc'd towards the two that follow'd;
then rushing at once upon the foremost, I knock'd him down with the Stock
of my Piece I was loath to fire, because 1 would not have the rest hear;
though at that distance, it would not have been easily heard, and being
out of Sight of the Smoke too, they wou'd not have easily known what to
make of it: Having knock'd this Fellow down, the other who pursu'd with
him stopp'd, as if he had been frighted; and I advanc'd a-pace towards
him; but as I came nearer, I perceiv'd presently, he had a Bow and Arrow,
and was fitting it to shoot at me; so I was then necessitated to shoot
at him first, which I did, and kill'd him at the first Shoot; the poor
Savage who fled, but had stopp'd; though he saw both his Enemies fallen,
and kill'd, as he thought; yet was so frighted with the Fire, and Noise
of my Piece, that he stood Stock still, and neither came forward or went
backward, tho' he seem'd rather enclin'd to fly still, than to come on;
I hollow'd again to him, and made Signs to come forward, which he easily
understood, and came a little way, then stopp'd again, and then a little
further, and stopp'd again, and I cou'd then perceive that he stood trembling,
as if he had been taken Prisoner, and had just been to be kill'd, as his
two Enemies were; I beckon'd him again to come to me, and gave him all
the Signs of Encouragement that I could think of, and he came nearer and
nearer, kneeling down every Ten or Twelve steps in token of acknowledgement
for my saving his Life: I smil'd at him, and look'd pleasantly, and beckon'd
to him to come still nearer; at length he came close to me, and then he
kneel'd down again, kiss'd the Ground, and laid his Head upon the Ground,
and taking me by the Foot, set my Foot upon his Head; this it seems was
in token of swearing to be my Slave for ever; I took him up, and made much
of him, and encourag'd him all I could. But there was more work to do yet,
for I perceived the Savage who I knock'd down, was not kill'd, but stunn'd
with the blow, and began to come to himself; so I pointed to him, and showing
him the Savage, that he was not dead; upon this he spoke some Words to
me, and though I could not understand them, yet I thought they were pleasant
to hear, for they were the first sound of a Man's Voice, that I had heard,
<I>my own excepted</I>, for above Twenty Five Years. But there was no time
for such Reflections now, the Savage who was knock'd down recover'd himself
so far, as to sit up upon the Ground, and I perceived that my Savage began
to be afraid; but when I saw that, I presented my other Piece at the Man,
as if I would shoot him, upon this my Savage, <I>for so I call him now</I>,
made a Motion to me to lend him my Sword, which hung naked in a Belt by
my side; so I did: he no sooner had it, but he runs to his Enemy, and at
one blow cut off his Head as cleaverly, no Executioner in <I>Germany,</I>
could have done it sooner or better; which I thought very strange, for
one who 1 had Reason to believe never saw a Sword in his Life before, except
their own Wooden Swords; however it seems, as I learn'd afterwards, they
make their Wooden Swords so sharp, so heavy, and the Wood is so hard, that
they will cut off Heads even with them, ay and Arms, and that at one blow
too; when he had done this, he comes laughing to me in Sign of Triumph,
and brought me the Sword again, and with abundance of Gestures which I
did not understand, laid it down with the Head of the Savage, that he had
kill'd just before me.

<P>But that which astonish'd him most, was to know how I had kill'd the
other Indian so far off, so pointing to him, he made Signs to me to let
him go to him, so I bad him go, as well as I could, when he came to him,
he stood like one amaz'd, looking at him, turn'd him first on one side,
then on t'other, look'd at the Wound the Bullet had made, which it seems
was just in his Breast, where it had made a Hole, and no great Quantity
of Blood had follow'd, but he had bled inwardly, for he was quite dead;
He took up his Bow, and Arrows, and came back, so I turn'd to go away,
and beckon'd to him to follow me, making Signs to him, that more might
come after them.

<P>Upon this he sign'd to me, that he should bury them with Sand, that
they might not be seen by the rest if they follow'd; and so I made Signs
again to him to do so; he fell to Work, and in an instant he had scrap'd
a Hole in the Sand, with his Hands, big enough to bury the first in, and
then dragg'd him into it, and cover'd him, and did so also by the other;
I believe he had bury'd them both in a Quarter of an Hour; then calling
him away, I carry'd him not to my Castle, but quite away to my Cave, on
the farther Part of the Island; so I did not let my Dream come to pass
in that Part, <I>viz.</I> That he came into my Grove for shelter.

<P>Here I gave him Bread, and a Bunch of Raisins to eat, and a Draught
of Water, which I found he was indeed in great Distress for, by his Running;
and having refresh'd him, I made Signs for him to go lie down and sleep;
pointing to a Place where I had laid a great Parcel of Rice Straw, and
a Blanket upon it, which 1 used to sleep upon my self some times; so the
poor Creature laid down, and went to sleep.

<P>He was a comely handsome Fellow, perfectly well made; with straight
strong Limbs, not too large; tall and well shap'd, and as I reckon, about
twenty six Years of Age. He had a very good Countenance, not a fierce and
surly Aspect; but seem'd to have something very manly in his Face, and
yet he had all the Sweetness and Softness of an <I>European</I> in his
Countenance too, especially when he smil'd. His Hair was long and black,
not curl'd like Wool; his Forehead very high, and large, and a great Vivacity
and sparkling Sharpness in his Eyes. The Colour of his Skin was not quite
black, but very tawny; and yet not of an ugly yellow nauseous tawny, as
the <I>Brasilians,</I> and <I>Virginians,</I> and other Natives of <I>America</I>
are; but of a bright kind of a dun olive Colour, that had in it something
very agreeable; tho' not very easy to describe. His Face was round, and
plump; his Nose small, not flat like the Negroes, a very good Mouth, thin
Lips, and his line Teeth well set, and white as Ivory. After he had slumber'd,
rather than slept, about half an Hour, he wak'd again, and comes out of
the Cave to me; for I had been milking my Goats, which I had in the Enclosure
just by: When he espy'd me, he came running to me, laying himself down
again upon the Ground, with all the possible Signs of an humble thankful
Disposition, making a many antick Gestures show it: At last he lays his
Head flat upon the Ground, close to my Foot, and sets my other Foot upon
his Head, as he had done before; and after this, made all the Signs to
me of Subjection, Servitude, and Submission imaginable, to let me know,
how he would serve me as long as he liv'd; I understood him in many Things,
and let him know, I was very well pleas'd with him; in a little Time I
began to speak to him, and teach him to speak to me; and first, I made
him know his Name should be <I>Friday,</I> which was the Day I sav'd his
Life; I call'd him so for the Memory of the Time; I likewise taught him
to say <I>Master,</I> and then let him know, that was to be my Name; I
likewise taught him to say, YES, and No, and to know the Meaning of them;
I gave him some Milk, in an earthen Pot, and let him see me Drink it before
him, and sop my Bread in it; and I gave him a Cake of Bread, to do the
like, which he quickly comply'd with, and made Signs that it was very good
for him.

<P>I kept there with him all that Night; but as soon as it was Day, I beckon'd
to him to come with me, and let him know, I would give him some Cloaths,
at which he seem'd very glad, for he was stark naked: As we went by the
Place where he had bury'd the two Men, he pointed exactly to the Place,
and shew'd me the Marks that he had made to find them again, making Signs
to me, that we should dig them up again, and eat them; at this I appear'd
very angry, express'd my Abhorrence of it, made as if I would vomit at
the Thoughts of it, and beckon'd with my Hand to him to come away, which
he did immediately, with great Sub mission. I then led him up to the Top
of the Hill, to see if his Enemies were gone; and pulling out my Glass,
I look'd, and saw plainly the Place where they had been, but no appearance
of them, or of their <I>Canoes;</I> so that it was plain they were gone,
and had left their two Comrades behind them, without any search after them.

<P>But I was not content with this Discovery; but having now more Courage,
and consequently more Curiosity, I takes my Man <I>Friday</I> with me,
giving him the Sword in his Hand, with the Bow and Arrows at his Back,
which I found he could use very dextrously, making him carry one Gun for
me, and I two for my self, and away we march'd to the Place, where these
Creatures had been; for I had a Mind now to get some fuller Intelligence
of them: When I came to the Place, my very Blood ran chill in my Veins,
and my Heart sunk within me, at the Horror of the Spectacle: indeed it
was a dreadful Sight, at least it was so to me; though <I>Friday</I> made
nothing of it: The Place was cover'd with humane Bones, the Ground dy'd
with their Blood, great Pieces of Flesh left here and there, half eaten,
mangl'd and scorch'd; and in short, all the Tokens of the triumphant Feast
they had been making there, after a Victory over their Enemies; I saw three
Skulls, five Hands, and the Bones of three or four Legs and Feet, and abundance
of other Parts of the Bodies; and <I>Friday,</I> by his Signs, made me
under stand, that they brought over four Prisoners to feast upon; that
three of them were eaten up, and that he, pointing to himself, was the
fourth: That there had been a great Battle between them, and their next
King, whose Subjects it seems he had been one of; and that they had taken
a great Number of Prisoners, all which were carry'd to several Places by
those that had taken them in the Fight, in order to feast upon them, as
was done here by these Wretches upon those they brought hither.

<P>I caus'd <I>Friday</I> to gather all the Skulls, Bones, Flesh, and whatever
remain'd, and lay them together on a Heap, and make a great Fire upon it,
and burn them all to Ashes: I found <I>Friday</I> had still a hankering
Stomach after some of the Flesh, and was still a Cannibal in his Nature;
but I discover'd so much Abhorrence at the very Thoughts of it, and at
the least Appearance of it, that he durst not discover it; for I had by
some Means let him know, that I would kill him if he offer'd it.

<P>When we had done this, we came back to our Castle, and there I fell
to work for my Man <I>Friday;</I> and first of all, I gave him a pair of
Linnen Drawers, which I had out of the poor Gunners Chest I mention'd,
and which I found in the Wreck; and which with a little Alteration fitted
him very well; then I made him a Jerkin of Goat's-skin, as well as my Skill
would allow; and I was now grown a tollerable good Taylor; and I gave him
a Cap, which I had made of a Hare-skin, very convenient, and fashionable
enough; and thus he was cloath'd for the present, tollerably well; and
was mighty well pleas'd to see himself almost as well cloath'd as his Master:
It is true, he went awkardly in these Things at first; wearing the Drawers
was very awkard to him, and the Sleeves of the Wastcoat gall'd his Shoulders,
and the inside of his Arms; but a little easing them where he com plain'd
they hurt him, and using himself to them, at length he took to them very
well.

<P>The next Day after I came home to my Hutch with him, I began to consider
where I should lodge him, and that I might do well for him, and yet be
perfectly easy my self; I made a little Tent for him in the vacant Place
between my two Fortifications, in the inside of the last, and in the outside
of the first; and as there was a Door, or Entrance there into my Cave,
I made a formal fram'd Door Case, and a Door to it of Boards, and set it
up in the Passage, a little within the Entrance; and causing the Door to
open on the inside, I barr'd it up in the Night, taking in my Ladders too;
so that <I>Friday</I> could no way come at me in the inside of my innermost
Wall, without making so much Noise in getting over, that it must needs
waken me; for my first Wall had now a compleat Roof over it of long Poles,
covering all my Tent, and leaning up to the side of the Hill, which was
again laid cross with smaller Sticks instead of Laths, and then thatch'd
over a great Thickness, with the Rice Straw, which was strong like Reeds;
and at the Hole or Place which was left to go in or out by the Ladder,
I had plac'd a kind of Trap-door, which if it had been attempted on the
outside, would not have open'd at all, but would have fallen down, and
made a great Noise; and as to Weapons, I took them all to my Side every
Night.

<P>But I needed none of all this Precaution; for never Man had a more faithful,
loving, sincere Servant, than <I>Friday</I> was to me; without Passions,
Sullenness or Designs, perfectly oblig'd and engag'd; his very Affections
were ty'd to me, like those of a Child to a Father; and I dare say, he
would have sacrific'd his Life for the saving mine, upon any occasion whatsoever;
the many Testimonies he gave me of this, put it out of doubt, and soon
convinc'd me, that I needed to use no Precautions, as to my Safety on his
Account.

<P>This frequently gave me occasion to observe, and that with wonder, that
however it had pleas'd God, in his Providence, and in the Government of
the Works of his Hands, to take from so great a Part of the World of his
Creatures, the best uses to which their Faculties, and the Powers of their
Souls are adapted; yet that he has bestow'd upon them the same Powers,
the same Reason, the same Affections, the same Sentiments of Kindness and
Obligation, the same Passions and Resentments of Wrongs, the same Sense
of Gratitude, Sincerity, Fidelity, and all the Capacities of doing Good,
and receiving Good, that he has given to us; and that when he pleases to
offer to them Occasions of exerting these, they are as ready, nay, more
ready to apply them to the right Uses for which they were bestow'd, than
we are; and this made me very melancholly sometimes, in reflecting as the
several Occasions presented, how mean a Use we make of all these, even
though we have these Powers enlighten'd by the great Lamp of Instruction,
the Spirit of God, and by the Knowledge of his Word, added to our Understanding;
and why it has pleas'd God to hide the like saving Knowledge from so many
Millions of Souls, who if I might judge by this poor Savage, would make
a much better use of it than we did.

<P>From hence, I sometimes was led too far to invade the Soveraignty of
<I>Providence,</I> and as it were arraign the Justice of so arbitrary a
Disposition of Things, that should hide that Light from some, and reveal
it to others, and yet expect a like Duty from both: But I shut it up, and
check'd my Thoughts with this Conclusion, (1st.) That we did not know by
what Light and Law these should be Condemn'd; but that as God was necessarily,
and by the Nature of his Being, infinitely Holy and Just, so it could not
be, but that if these Creatures were all sentenc'd to Absence from himself,
it was on account of sinning against that Light which, as the Scripture
says, was a Law to themselves, and by such Rules as their Consciences would
acknowledge to be just, tho' the Foundation was not discover'd to us: And
(2d.) that still as we are all the Clay in the Hand of the Potter, no Vessel
could say to him, Why hast thou form'd me thus?

<P>But to return to my New Companion; I was greatly delighted with him,
and made it my Business to teach him every Thing, that was proper to make
him useful, handy, and helpful; but especially to make him speak, and under
stand me when I spake, and he was the aptest Schollar that ever was, and
particularly was so merry, so constantly diligent, and so pleased, when
he cou'd but understand me, or make me understand him, that it was very
pleasant to me to talk to him; and now my Life began to be so easy, that
I began to say to my self, that could I but have been safe from more Savages,
I cared not, if I was never to remove from the place while I lived.

<P>After I had been two or three Days return'd to my Castle, I thought
that, in order to bring <I>Friday</I> off from his horrid way of feeding,
and from the Relish of a Cannibal's Stomach, I ought to let him taste other
Flesh; so I took him out with me one Morning to the Woods: I went indeed
intending to kill a Kid out of my own Flock, and bring him home and dress
it. But as I was going, I saw a She Goat lying down in the Shade, and two
young Kids sitting by her; I catch'd hold of <I>Friday</I>, hold says I,
stand still; and made Signs to him not to stir, immediately I presented
my Piece, shot and kill'd one of the Kids. The poor Creature who had at
a Distance indeed seen me kill the Savage his Enemy, but did not know,
or could imagine how it was done, was sensibly surpriz'd, trembled, and
shook, and look'd so amaz'd, that I thought he would have sunk down. He
did not see the Kid I shot at, or perceive I had kill'd it, but ripp'd
up his Wastcoat to feel if he was not wounded, and as I found, presently
thought I was resolv'd to kill him; for he came and kneel'd down to me,
and embraceing my Knees, said a great many Things I did not understand;
but I could easily see that the meaning was to pray me not to kill him.

<P>I soon found a way to convince him that I would do him no harm, and
taking him up by the Hand laugh'd at him, and pointed to the Kid which
I had kill'd, beckoned to him to run and fetch it, which he did; and while
he was wondering and looking to see how the Creature was kill'd, I loaded
my Gun again, and by and by I saw a great Fowl like a Hawk sit upon a Tree
within Shot; so to let <I>Friday</I> understand a little what I would do,
I call'd him to me again, pointed at the Fowl which was indeed a Parrot,
tho' I thought it had been a Hawk, I say pointing to the Parrot, and to
my Gun, and to the Ground under the Parrot, to let him see I would make
it fall, I made him understand that I would shoot and kill that Bird; accordingly
I fir'd and bad him look, and immediately he saw the Parrot fall, he stood
like one frighted again, notwithstanding all I had said to him; and I found
he was the more amaz'd, because he did not see me put any Thing into the
Gun; but thought that there must be some wonderful Fund of Death and Destruction
in that Thing, able to kill Man, Beast, Bird, or any Thing near, or far
off; and the Astonishment this created in him was such, as could not wear
off for a long Time; and I believe, if I would have let him, he would have
worshipp'd me and my Gun: As for the Gun it self, he would not so much
as touch it for several Days after; but would speak to it, and talk to
it, as if it had answer'd him, when he was by himself; which, as I afterwards
learn'd of him, was to desire it not to kill him.

<P>Well, after his Astonishment was a little over at this, I pointed to
him to run and fetch the Bird I had shot, which he did, but stay'd some
Time; for the Parrot not being quite dead, was flutter'd away a good way
off from the Place where she fell; however, he found her, took her up,
and brought her to me; and as I had perceivd his Ignorance about the Gun
before, I took this Advantage to charge the Gun again, and not let him
see me do it, that 1 might be ready for any other Mark that might present;
but nothing more offer'd at that Time; so I brought home the Kid, and the
same Evening I took the Skin off, and cut it out as well as I could; and
having a Pot for that purpose, I boil'd, or stew'd some of the Flesh, and
made some very good Broth; and after I had begun to eat some, I gave some
to my Man, who seem'd very glad of it, and lik'd it very well; but that
which was strangest to him, was, to see me eat Salt with it; he made a
Sign to me, that the Salt was not good to eat, and putting a little into
his own Mouth, he seem'd to nauseate it, and would spit and sputter at
it, washing his Mouth with fresh Water after it; on the other hand, I took
some Meat in my Mouth without Salt, and I pretended to spit and sputter
for want of Salt, as fast as he had done at the Salt; but it would not
do, he would never care for Salt with his Meat, or in his Broth; at least
not a great while, and then but a very little.

<P>Having thus fed him with boil'd Meat and Broth, I was resolv'd to feast
him the next Day with roasting a Piece of the Kid; this 1 did by hanging
it before the Fire, in a String, as I had seen many People do in <I>England,</I>
setting two Poles up, one on each side the Fire, and one cross on the Top,
and tying the String to the Cross-stick, letting the Meat turn continually:
This <I>Friday</I> admir'd very much; but when he came to taste the Flesh,
he took so many ways to tell me how well he lik'd it, that I could not
but understand him; and at last he told me he would never eat Man's Flesh
any more, which I was very glad to hear.

<P>The next Day I set him to work to beating some Corn out, and sifting
it in the manner I us'd to do, as I observ'd before and he soon understood
how to do it as well as I, especially after he had seen what the Meaning
of it was, and that it was to make Bread of; for after that I let him see
me make my Bread, and bake it too, and in a little Time <I>Friday</I> was
able to do all the Work for me, as well as I could do it my self.

<P>I begun now to consider, that having two Mouths to feed, instead of
one, I must provide more Ground for my Harvest, and plant a larger Quantity
of Corn, than I us'd to do; so I mark'd out a larger Piece of Land, and
began the Fence in the same Manner as before, in which <I>Friday</I> not
only work'd very willingly, and very hard; but did it very chearfully,
and I told him what it was for; that it was for Corn to make more Bread,
because he was now with me, and that I might have enough for him, and my
self too: He appear'd very sensible of that Part, and let me know, that
he thought I had much more Labour upon me on his Account, than I had for
my self; and that he would work the harder for me, if I would tell him
what to do.

<P>This was the pleasantest Year of all the Life I led in this Place; <I>Friday</I>
began to talk pretty well, and understand the Names of almost every Thing
I had occasion to call for, and of every Place I had to send him to, and
talk'd a great deal to me; so that in short I began now to have some Use
for my Tongue again, which indeed I had very little occasion for before;
that is to say, <I>about Speech</I>; besides the Pleasure of talking to
him, I had a singular Satisfaction in the Fellow himself; his simple unfeign'd
Honesty, appear'd to me more and more every Day, and I began really to
love the Creature; and on his Side, I believe he lov'd me more than it
was possible for him ever to love any Thing before.

<P>I had a Mind once to try if he had any hankering Inclination to his
own Country again, and having learn'd him <I>English</I> so well that he
could answer me almost any Questions, I ask'd him whether the Nation that
he belong'd to never conquer'd in Battle, at which he smil'd; and said;
yes, yes, we always fight the better; that is, he meant always get the
better in Fight; and so we began the following Discourse: You always fight
the better said I, How came you to be taken Prisoner then, <I>Friday</I>?

<P><I>Friday</I>, My Nation beat much, for all that.

<P><I>Master,</I> How beat; if your Nation beat them, how come you to be
taken?

<P><I>Friday</I>, They more many than my Nation in the Place where me was;
they take one, two, three, and me; my Nation over beat them in the yonder
Place, where me no was; there my Nation take one, two, great Thousand.

<P><I>Master,</I> But why did not your Side recover you from the Hands
of your Enemies then?

<P><I>Friday</I>, They run one, two, three, and me, and make go in the
<I>Canoe;</I> my Nation have no <I>Canoe</I> that time.

<P><I>Master,</I> Well, <I>Friday</I>, and What does your Nation do with
the Men they take, do they carry them away, and eat them, as these did?

<P><I>Friday</I>, Yes, my Nation eat Mans too, eat all up.

<P><I>Master,</I> Where do they carry them?

<P><I>Friday</I>, Go to other Place where they think.

<P><I>Master,</I> Do they come hither?

<P><I>Friday</I>, Yes, yes, they come hither; come other else Place.

<P>Master, Have you been here with them?

<P><I>Friday</I>, Yes, I been here; [<I>points to the</I> N.W. <I>Side
of the Island,</I> which it seems was their Side.]

<P>By this I understood, that my Man <I>Friday</I> had formerly been among
the Savages, who us'd to come on Shore on the farther Part of the Island,
on the same Man eating Occasions that he was now brought for; and sometime
after, when I took the Courage to carry him to that Side, being the same
I formerly mention'd, he presently knew the Place, and told me, he was
there once when they eat up twenty Men, two Women, and one Child; he could
not tell Twenty in <I>English;</I> but he numbred them by laying so many
Stones on a Row, and pointing to me to tell them over.

<P>I have told this Passage, because it introduces what follows; that after
I had had this Discourse with him, I ask'd him how far it was from our
Island to the Shore, and whether the <I>Canoes</I> were not often lost;
he told me, there was no Danger, no <I>Canoes</I> ever lost; but that after
a little way out to the Sea, there was a Current, and Wind, always one
way in the Morning, the other in the Afternoon.

<P>This I understood to be no more than the Sets of the Tide, as going
out, or coming in; but I afterwards understood, it was occasion'd by the
great Draft and Reflux of the mighty River <I>Oroonooko;</I> in the Mouth,
or the Gulph of which River, as I found afterwards, our Island lay; and
this Land which I perceiv'd to the <I>W.</I> and <I>N. W.</I> was the great
Island <I>Trinidad,</I> on the <I>North</I> Point of the Mouth of the River:
I ask'd <I>Friday</I> a thousand Questions about the Country, the Inhabitants,
the Sea, the Coast, and what Nation were near; he told me all he knew with
the greatest Openness imaginable; I ask'd him the Names of the several
Nations of his Sort of People; but could get no other Name than <I>Caribs;</I>
from whence I easily understood, that these were the <I>Caribbees,</I>
which our Maps place on the Part of America, which reaches from the Mouth
of the River <I>Oroonooko</I> to <I>Guiana,</I> and onwards to <I>St. Martha:</I>
He told me that up a great way beyond the Moon, that was, beyond the Setting
of the Moon, which must be <I>W.</I> from their Country, there dwelt white
bearded Men, like me; and pointed to my great Whiskers, which I mention'd
before; and that they had kill'd <I>much Mans,</I> that was his Word; by
all which I under stood he meant the <I>Spaniards,</I> whose Cruelties
in <I>America</I> had been spread over the whole Countries, and was remember'd
by all the Nations from Father to Son.

<P>I enquir'd if he could tell me how I might come from this Island, and
get among those white Men; he told me, yes, yes, I might go <I>in two Canoe;</I>
I could not understand what he meant, or make him describe to me what he
meant by <I>two Canoe,</I> till at last with great Difficulty, I found
he meant it must be in a large great Boat, as big as <I>two Canoes.</I>

<P>This Part of <I>Friday</I>'s Discourse began to relish with me very
well, and from this Time I entertain'd some Hopes, that one Time or other,
I might find an Opportunity to make my Escape from this Place; and that
this poor Savage might be a Means to help me to do It.

<P>During the long Time that <I>Friday</I> has now been with me, and that
he began to speak to me, and understand me, I was not wanting to lay a
Foundation of religious Knowledge in his Mind; particularly I ask'd him
one Time who made him? The poor Creature did not understand me at all,
but thought I had ask'd who was his Father; but I took it by another handle,
and ask'd him who made the Sea, the Ground we walk'd on, and the Hills,
and Woods; he told me it was one old <I>Benamuckee,</I> that liv'd beyond
all: He could describe nothing of this great Person, but that he was very
old; much older he said than the Sea, or the Land; than the Moon, or the
Stars: I ask'd him then, if this old Person had made all Things, why did
not all Things worship him; he look'd very grave, and with a perfect Look
of Innocence, said, <I>All Things do say O to him:</I> I ask'd him if the
People who die in his Country went away any where; he said, yes, they all
went to <I>Benamuckee;</I> then I ask'd him whether these they eat up went
thither too, he said yes.

<P>From these Things, I began to instruct him in the Know ledge of the
true God: I told him that the great Maker of all Things liv'd up there,
pointing up towards Heaven: That he governs the World by the same Power
and Providence by which he had made it: That he was omnipotent, could do
every Thing for us, give every Thing to us, take every Thing from us; and
thus by Degrees I open'd his Eyes. He listned with great Attention, and
receiv'd with Pleasure the Notion of <I>Jesus Christ</I> being sent to
redeem us, and of the Manner of making our Prayers to God, and his being
able to hear us, even into Heaven; he told me one Day, that if our God
could hear us up beyond the Sun, he must needs be a greater God than their
<I>Benamuckee,</I> who liv'd but a little way off, and yet could not hear,
till they went up to the great Mountains where he dwelt, to speak to him;
I ask'd him if ever he went thither, to speak to him; he said no, they
never went that were young Men; none went thither but the old Men, who
he call'd their <I>Oowocakee,</I> that is, as I made him explain it to
me, their Religious, or Clergy, and that they went to say O, (so he called
saying Prayers) and then came back, and told them what <I>Benamuckee</I>
said: By this I observ'd, That there is <I>Priestcraft,</I> even amongst
the most blinded ignorant Pagans in the World; and the Policy of making
a secret Religion, in order to preserve the Veneration of the People to
the Clergy, is not only to be found in the <I>Roman,</I> but perhaps among
all Religions in the World, even among the most brutish and barbarous Savages.

<P>I endeavour'd to clear up this Fraud, to my Man <I>Friday</I>, and told
him, that the Pretence of their old Men going up the Mountains, to say
<I>O</I> to their God <I>Benamuckee,</I> was a Cheat, and their bringing
Word from thence what he said, was much more so; that if they met with
any Answer, or spake with any one there, it must be with an evil Spirit:
And then I entred into a long Discourse with him about the Devil, the Original
of him, his Rebellion against God, his Enmity to Man, the Reason of it,
his setting himself up in the dark Parts of the World to be Worship'd instead
of God, and as God; and the many Stratagems he made use of to delude Mankind
to his Ruine; how he had a secret access to our Passions, and to our Affections,
to adapt his Snares so to our Inclinations, as to cause us even to be our
own Tempters, and to run upon our Destruction by our own Choice.

<P>I found it was not so easie to imprint right Notions in his Mind about
the Devil, as it was about the Being of a God. Nature assisted all my Arguments
to Evidence to him, even the Necessity Of a great first Cause and over-ruling
governing Power; a secret directing Providence, and of the Equity, and
Justice, of paying Homage to him that made us, and the like. But there
appeared nothing of all this in the Notion of an evil Spirit; of his Original,
his Being, his Nature, and above all of his Inclination to do Evil, and
to draw us in to do so too; and the poor Creature puzzl'd me once in such
a manner, by a Question meerly natural and innocent, that I scarce knew
what to say to him. I had been talking a great deal to him of the Power
of God, his Omnipotence, his dreadful Nature to Sin, his being a consuming
Fire to the Workers of Iniquity; how, as he had made us all, he could destroy
us and all the World in a Moment; and he listen'd with great Seriousness
to me all the while.

<P>After this, I had been telling him how the Devil was God's Enemy in
the Hearts of Men, and used all his Malice and Skill to defeat the good
Designs of Providence, and to ruine the Kingdom of Christ in the World;
and the like. Well, says <I>Friday</I>, but you say, God is so strong,
so great, is he not much strong, much might as the Devil? Yes, yes, says
I, <I>Friday</I>, God is stronger than the Devil, God is above the Devil,
and therefore we pray to God to tread him down under our Feet, and enable
us to resist his Temptations and quench his fiery Darts. But, says he again,
<I>if God much strong, much might as the Devil, why God no kill the Devil,
so make him no more do wicked?</I>

<P>I was strangely surpriz'd at his Question, and after all, tho' I was
now an old Man, yet I was but a young Doctor, and ill enough quallified
for a Casuist, or a Solver of Difficulties And at first I could not tell
what to say, so I pre tended not to hear him, and ask'd him what he said?
But he was too earnest for an Answer to forget his Question; so that he
repeated it in the very same broken Words, as above. By this time I had
recovered my self a little, and I said, <I>God will at last punish him
severely;</I> he is <I>reserv'd for the Judgment, and is to be cast into
the Bottomless-Pit, to dwell with ever lasting Fire.</I> This did not satisfie
<I>Friday</I>, but he returns upon me, repeating my Words, RESERVE, AT
LAST, <I>me no understand; but, Why not kill the Devil now, not kill great
ago?</I> You may as well ask me, <I>said I</I>, Why God does not kill you
and I, when we do wicked Things here that offend him? We are preserv'd
to repent and be pardon'd: He muses a while at this; mell, All, says he,
mighty affectionately, <I>that well; so you, I, Devil, all wicked, all
preserve, repent, God pardon all.</I> Here I was run down again by him
to the last Degree, and it was a Testimony to me, how the meer Notions
of Nature, though they will guide reasonable Creatures to the Know ledge
of a God, and of a Worship or Homage due to the supreme Being, of God as
the Consequence of our Nature; yet nothing but divine Revelation can form
the Knowledge of Jesus Christ, and of a Redemption purchas'd for us, of
a Mediator of the new Covenant, and of an Intercessor, at the Foot-stool
of God's Throne; I say, nothing but a Revelation from Heaven, can form
these in the Soul, and that therefore the Gospel of our Lord and Saviour
<I>Jesus Christ;</I> I mean, the Word of God, and the Spirit of God promis'd
for the Guide and Sanctifier of his People, are the absolutely necessary
Instructors of the Souls of Men, in the saving Knowledge of God, and the
Means of Salvation.

<P>I therefore diverted the present Discourse between me and my Man, rising
up hastily, as upon some sudden Occasion of going out; then sending him
for something a good way off, I seriously pray'd to God that he would enable
me to instruct savingly this poor Savage, assisting by his Spirit the Heart
of the poor ignorant Creature, to receive the Light of the Knowledge of
God in <I>Christ,</I> reconciling him to himself, and would guide me to
speak so to him from the Word of God, as his Conscience might be convinc'd,
hid Eyes open'd, and his Soul sav'd. When he came again to me, I entred
into a long Discourse with him upon the Subject of the Redemption of Man
by the Saviour of the World, and of the Doctrine of the Gospel preach'd
from Heaven, <I>viz</I>. of Repentance towards God, and Faith in our Blessed
Lord Jesus. I then explain'd to him, as well as I could, why our Blessed
Redeemer took not on him the Nature of Angels, but the Seed of <I>Abraham,</I>
and how for that Reason the fallen Angels had no Share in the Redemption;
that he came only to the lost Sheep of the House of <I>Israel,</I> and
the like.

<P>I had, <I>God knows</I>, more Sincerity than Knowledge, in all the Methods
I took for this poor Creature's Instruction, and must acknowledge what
I believe all that act upon the same Principle will find, That in laying
Things open to him, I really inform'd and instructed my self in many Things,
that either I did not know, or had not fully consider'd before; but which
occurr'd naturally to my Mind, upon my searching into them, for the Information
of this poor Savage; and I had more Affection in my Enquiry after Things
upon this Occasion, than ever I felt before; so that whether this poor
wild Wretch was the better for me, or no, I had great Reason to be thankful
that ever he came to me: My Grief set lighter upon me, my Habitation grew
comfortable to me beyond Measure; and when I reflected that in this solitary
Life which I had been confin'd to, I had not only been moved my self to
look up to Heaven, and to seek to the Hand that had brought me there; but
was now to be made an Instrument under Providence to save the Life, and
<I>for ought I knew,</I> the Soul of a poor Savage, and bring him to the
true Knowledge of Religion, and of the Christian Doctrine, that he might
know Christ Jesus, <I>to know whom is Life eternal.</I> I say, when I reflected
upon all these Things, a secret Joy run through every Part of my Soul,
and I frequently rejoyc'd that ever I was brought to this Place, which
I had so often thought the most dreadful of all Afflictions that could
possibly have befallen me.

<P>In this thankful Frame I continu'd all the Remainder of my Time, and
the Conversation which employ'd the Hours between <I>Friday</I> and I,
was such, as made the three Years which we liv'd there together perfectly
and compleatly happy, <I>if any such Thing as compleat Happiness can be
form'd in a sublunary State.</I> The Savage was now a good Christian, a
much better than I; though I have reason to hope, and bless God for it,
that we were equally penitent, and comforted restor'd Penitents; we had
here the Word of God to read, and no farther off from his Spirit to instruct,
than if we had been in <I>England.</I>

<P>I always apply'd my self in Reading the Scripture, to let him know,
as well as I could, the Meaning of what I read; and he again, by his serious
Enquiries, and Questionings, made me, <I>as I said before,</I> a much better
Scholar in the Scripture Knowledge, than I should ever have been by my
own private meer Reading. Another thing I cannot refrain from observing
here also from Experience, in this retir'd Part of my Life<I>,viz.</I>
How infinite and inexpressible a Blessing it is, that the Knowledge of
God, and of the Doctrine of Salvation by <I>Christ Jesus,</I> is so plainly
laid down in the Word of God; so easy to be receiv'd and understood: That
as the bare reading the Scripture made me capable of understanding enough
of my Duty, to carry me directly on to the great Work of sincere Repentance
for my Sins, and laying hold of a Saviour for Life and Salvation, to a
stated Reformation in Practice, and Obedience to all God's Commands, and
this without any Teacher or Instructer; I mean, humane; so the same plain
Instruction sufficiently serv'd to the enlightning this Savage Creature,
and bringing him to be such a Christian, as I have known few equal to him
in my Life.

<P>As to all the Disputes, Wranglings, Strife and Contention, which has
happen'd in the World about Religion, whether Niceties in Doctrines, or
Schemes of Church Government, they were all perfectly useless to us; as
for ought I can yet see, they have been to all the rest of the World: We
had the <I>sure</I> Guide to Heaven, <I>viz</I>. The Word of God; and we
had, <I>blessed be God,</I> comfortable Views of the Spirit of God teaching
and instructing us by his Word, <I>leading us into all Truth,</I> and making
us both willing and obedient to the Instruction of his Word; and I cannot
see the least Use that the greatest Knowledge of the disputed Points in
Religion which have made such Confusions in the World would have been to
us, if we could have obtain'd it; but I must go on with the Historical
Part of Things, and take every Part in its order.

<P>After <I>Friday</I> and I became more intimately acquainted, and that
he could understand almost all I said to him, and speak fluently, though
in broken <I>English</I> to me; I acquainted him with my own Story, or
at least so much of it as related to my coming into the Place, how I had
liv'd there, and how long. I let him into the Mystery, for such it was
to him, of Gunpowder, and Bullet, and taught him how to shoot: I gave him
a Knife, which he was wonderfully delighted with, and I made him a Belt,
with a Frog hanging to it, such as in <I>England</I> we wear Hangers in;
and in the Frog, instead of a Hanger, I gave him a Hatchet, which was not
only as good a Weapon in some Cases, but much more useful upon other Occasions.

<P>I describ'd to him the Country of <I>Europe,</I> and particularly <I>England,</I>
which I came from; how we liv'd, how we worshipp'd God, how we behav'd
to one another; and how we traded in Ships to all Parts of the World: I
gave him an Account of the Wreck which I had been on board of, and shew'd
him as near as I could, the Place where she lay; but she was all beaten
in Pieces before, and gone.

<P>I shew'd him the Ruins of our Boat, which we lost when we escap'd, and
which I could not stir with my whole Strength then; but was now fallen
almost all to Pieces: Upon seeing this Boat, <I>Friday</I> stood musing
a great while, and said nothing; I ask'd him what it was he study'd upon,
at last says he, <I>me see such Boat like come to Place at my Nation.</I>

<P>I did not understand him a good while; but at last, when I had examin'd
farther into it, I understood by him, that a Boat, such as that had been,
came on Shore upon the Country where he liv'd; that is, as he explain'd
it, was driven thither by Stress of Weather: I presently imagin'd, that
some <I>European</I> Ship must have been cast away upon their Coast, and
the Boat might get loose, and drive a Shore; but was so dull, that I never
once thought of Men making escape from a Wreck thither, much less whence
they might come; so I only enquir'd after a Description of the Boat.

<P><I>Friday</I> describ'd the Boat to me well enough; but brought me better
to understand him, when he added with some Warmth, <I>we save the white
Mans from drown:</I> Then I presently ask'd him, if there was any <I>white
Mans</I>, as he call'd them, in the Boat; yes, he said, <I>the Boat full
white Mans</I>: I ask'd him how many; he told upon his Fingers seventeen:
I ask'd him then what become of them; he told me, <I>they live, they dwell
at my Nation.</I>

<P>This put new Thoughts into my Head; for I presently imagin'd, that these
might be the Men belonging to the Ship, that was cast away in Sight of
<I>my Island,</I> as I now call it; and who after the Ship was struck on
the Rock, and they saw her inevitably lost, had sav'd themselves in their
Boat, and were landed upon that wild Shore among the Savages.

<P>Upon this, I enquir'd of him more critically, What was become of them?
He assur'd me they lived still there; that they had been there about four
Years; that the Savages let them alone, and gave them Victuals to live.
I ask'd him, How it came to pass they did not kill them and eat them? He
said <I>No, they make Brother with them</I>; that is, as I understood him,
a Truce: And then he added, <I>They no eat Mans but when make the War fight;</I>
that is to say, they never eat any Men but such as come to fight with them,
and are taken in Battle.

<P>It was after this some considerable Time, that being upon the Top of
the Hill, at the <I>East</I> Side of the Island, from whence as have said,
I had in a clear Day discover'd the Main, or Continent of <I>America</I>;
<I>Friday</I>, the Weather being very serene, looks very earnestly towards
the Main Land, and in a kind of Surprise, falls a jumping and dancing,
and calls out to me, for I was at some Distance from him: I ask'd him,
What was the Matter? <I>O joy</I>! Says he, <I>O glad</I>! <I>There see
my Country, there my Nation</I>!

<P>I observ'd an extraordinary Sense of Pleasure appear'd in his Face,
and his Eyes sparkled, and his Countenance discover'd a strange Eagerness,
as if he had a Mind to be in his own Country again; and this Observation
of mine, put a great many Thoughts into me, which made me at first not
so easy about my new Man <I>Friday</I> as I was before; and I made no doubt,
but that if <I>Friday</I> could get back to his own Nation again, he would
not only forget all his Religion, but all his Obligation to me; and would
be forward enough to give his Countrymen an Account of me, and come back
perhaps with a hundred or two of them, and make a Feast upon me, at which
he might be as merry as he us'd to be with those of his Enemies, when they
were taken in War.

<P>But I wrong'd the poor honest Creature very much, for which I was very
sorry afterwards. However as my Jealousy encreased, and held me some Weeks,
I was a little more circumspect, and not so familiar and kind to him as
before; in which I was certainly in the Wrong too, the honest grateful
Creature having no thought about it, but what consisted with the best Principles,
both as a religious Christian, and as a grateful Friend, as appeared afterwards
to my full Satisfaction.

<P>While my Jealousy of him lasted, you may be sure I was every Day pumping
him to see if he would discover any of the new Thoughts, which I suspected
were in him; but I found every thing he said was so Honest, and so Innocent,
that I could find nothing to nourish my Suspicion; and in spight of all
my Uneasiness he made me at last entirely his own again, nor did he in
the least perceive that I was Uneasie, and therefore I could not suspect
him of Deceit.

<P>One Day walking up the same Hill, but the Weather being haizy at Sea,
so that we could not see the Continent, I call'd to him, and said, <I>Friday</I>,
do not you wish your self in your own Country, your own Nation? Yes, he
said, <I>he be much O glad to be at his own Nation</I>. What would you
do there said I, would you turn Wild again, eat Mens Flesh again, and be
a Savage as you were before? He lookt full of Concern, and shaking his
Head said, <I>No no, </I>Friday <I>tell them to live Good</I>, tell them
<I>to pray God</I>, tell them <I>to eat Corn bread, Cattleflesh, Milk,
no eat Man again: </I>Why then said I to him, <I>They will kill you</I>.
He look'd grave at that, and then said, <I>No, they no kill me, they willing
love learn</I>: He meant by this, they would be willing to learn. He added,
they learn'd much of the Bearded-Mans that come in the Boat. Then I ask'd
him if he would go back to them? He smil'd at that, and told me he could
not swim so far. I told him I would make a <I>Canoe</I> for him. He told
me, <I>he would go, if I would go with him</I>. I go! says I, why they
will Eat me if I come there! No, no, says he, <I>me make they no Eat you;
me make they much Love you</I>: He meant he would tell them how I had kill'd
his Enemies, and sav'd his Life, and so he would make them love me; then
he told me as well as he could, how kind they were to seventeen White-men,
or Bearded-men, as he call'd them, who came on Shore there in Distress.

<P>From this time I confess I had a Mind to venture over, and see if I
could possibly joyn with these Bearded-men, who I made no doubt were <I>Spaniards
</I>or <I>Portuguese</I>; not doubting but if I could we might find some
Method to Escape from thence, being upon the Continent, and a good Company
together, better than I could from an Island 40 Miles off the Shore, and
alone without Help. So after some Days I took <I>Friday</I> to work again,
by way of Discourse, and told him I would give him a Boat to go back to
his own Nation; and accordingly I carry'd him to my Frigate which lay on
the other Side of the Island, and having clear'd it of Water, for I always
kept it sunk in the Water, I brought it out, shewed it him, and we both
went into it.

<P>I found he was a most dextrous Fellow at managing it, would make it
go almost as swift and fast again as I could; so when he was in, I said
to him, Well now, <I>Friday</I>, shall we go to your Nation? He look'd
very dull at my saying so, which it seems was, because he thought the Boat
too small to go so far. I told him then I had a bigger; so the next Day
I went to the Place where the first Boat lay which I had made, but which
I could not get into Water: He said that was big enough; but then as I
had taken no Care of it, and it had lain two or three and twenty Years
there, the Sun had split and dry'd it, that it was in a manner rotten.
<I>Friday</I> told me such a Boat would do very well, and would carry <I>much
enough Vittle, Drink, Bread, </I>that was his Way of Talking.

<P>Upon the whole, I was by this Time so fix'd upon my Design of going
over with him to the Continent, that I told him we would go and make one
as big as that, and he should go home in it. He answer'd not one Word,
but look'd very grave and sad: I ask'd him what was the matter with him?
He ask'd me again thus; <I>Why, you angry mad with </I>Friday, <I>what
me done</I>? I ask'd him what he meant; I told him I was not angry with
him at all. <I>No angry! No angry! </I>says he, repeating the Words several
Times, <I>Why send </I>Friday <I>home away to my Nation</I>? Why, (says
I) <I>Friday</I>, did you not say you wish'd you were there? <I>Yes, yes</I>,
says he, <I>wish be both there, no wish </I>Friday <I>there, no Master
there</I>. In a Word, he would not think of going there without me; <I>I
go there! </I>Friday, (says I) <I>what shall I do there? </I>He turn'd
very quick upon me at this: <I>You do great deal much good, </I>says he,
<I>you teach wild Mans be good sober tame Mans; you tell them know God,
pray and live new Life. Alas! </I>Friday, (says I) <I>thou knowest not
what thou sayest, I am but an ignorant Man my self Yes, yes, </I>says he,
<I>you teachee me Good, you teachee them Good. No, no, </I>Friday, (says
I) <I>you shall go without me, leave me here to live by my self as I did
before. </I>He look'd confus'd again at that Word, and running to one of
the Hatchets which he used to wear, he takes it up hastily, comes and gives
it me, <I>What must I do with this? </I>says I to him. <I>You take, kill
</I>Friday; (says he.) <I>What must I kill you for? </I>said I again. He
returns very quick, <I>What you send </I>Friday <I>away for? take, kill
</I>Friday, <I>no send </I>Friday <I>away. This he spoke so earnestly,
that I saw Tears stand in his Eyes: In a Word, I so plainly discover'd
the utmost Affection in him to me, and a firm Resolution in him, that I
told him then, and often after, that I would never send him away from me,
if he was willing to stay with me.</I>

<P><I>Upon the whole, as I found by all his Discourse a settled Affection
to me, and that nothing should part him from me, so I found all the Foundation
of his Desire to go to his own Country, was laid in his ardent Affection
to the People, and his Hopes of my doing them good; a Thing which as I
had no Notion of my self, so I had not the least Thought or Intention,
or Desire of undertaking it. But still I found a strong Inclination to
my attempting an Escape as above, founded on the Supposition gather'd from
the Discourse, (viz</I>.) That there were seventeen bearded Men there;
and therefore, without any more Delay, I went to Work with <I>Friday</I>
to find out a great Tree proper to fell, and make a large Periagua or Canoe
to undertake the Voyage. There were Trees enough in the Island to have
built a little Fleet, not of Periagua's and Canoes, but even of good large
Vessels. But the main Thing I look'd at, was to get one so near the Water
that we might launch it when it was made, to avoid the Mistake I committed
at first.

<P>At last, <I>Friday</I> pitch'd upon a Tree, for I found he knew much
better than I what kind of Wood was fittest for it, nor can I tell to this
Day what Wood to call the Tree we cut down, except that it was very like
the Tree we call <I>Fustic</I>, or between that and the <I>Nicaragua </I>Wood,
for it was much of the same Colour and Smell. <I>Friday</I> was for burning
the Hollow or Cavity of this Tree out to make it for a Boat. But I shew'd
him how rather to cut it out with Tools, which, after I had shew'd him
how to use, he did very handily, and in about a Month's hard Labour, we
finished it, and made it very handsome, especially when with our Axes,
which I shew'd him how to handle, we cut and hew'd the out-side into the
true Shape of a Boat; after this, however, it cost us near a Fortnight's
Time to get her along as it were Inch by Inch upon great Rowlers into the
Water. But when she was in, she would have carry'd twenty Men with great
Ease.

<P>When she was in the Water, and tho' she was so big it amazed me to see
with what Dexterity and how swift my Man <I>Friday</I> would manage her,
turn her, and paddle her along; so I ask'd him if he would, and if we might
venture over in her; <I>Yes</I>, he said, he <I>venture over in her very
well, tho' great blow Wind. </I>However, I had a farther Design that he
knew nothing of, and that was to make a Mast and Sail and to fit her with
an Anchor and Cable: As to a Mast, that was easy enough to get; so I pitch'd
upon a strait young Cedar-Tree, which I found near the Place, and which
there was great Plenty of in the Island, and I set <I>Friday</I> to Work
to cut it down, and gave him Directions how to shape and order it. But
as to the Sail, that was my particular Care; I knew I had old Sails, or
rather Pieces of old Sails enough; but as I had had them now six and twenty
Years by me, and had not been very careful to preserve them, not imagining
that I should ever have this kind of Use for them, I did not doubt but
they were all rotten, and indeed most of them were so; however, I found
two Pieces which appear'd pretty good, and with these I went to Work, and
with a great deal of Pains, and awkward tedious stitching (you may be sure)
for Want of Needles, I at length made a three Corner'd ugly Thing, like
what we call in <I>England</I>, a Shoulder of Mutton Sail, to go with a
Boom at bottom, and a little short Sprit at the Top, such as usually our
Ships Long Boats sail with, and such as I best knew how to manage; because
it was such a one as I had to the Boat, in which I made my Escape from
<I>Barbary</I>, as related in the first Part of my Story.

<P>I was near two Months performing this last Work, <I>viz</I>. rigging
and fitting my Mast and Sails; for I finish'd them very compleat, making
a small Stay, and a Sail, or Foresail to it, to assist, if we should turn
to Windward; and which was more than all, I fix'd a Rudder to the Stern
of her, to steer with; and though I was but a bungling Shipwright, yet
as I knew the Usefulness, and even Necessity of such a Thing, I apply'd
my self with so much Pains to do it, that at last I brought it to pass;
though considering the many dull Contrivances I had for it that sail'd,
I think it cost me almost as much Labour as making the Boat.

<P>After all this was done too, I had my Man <I>Friday</I> to teach as
to what belong'd to the Navigation of my Boat; for though he knew very
well how to paddle a <I>Canoe</I>, he knew nothing what belong'd to a Sail,
and a Rudder; and was the most amaz'd, when he saw me work the Boat too
and again in the Sea by the Rudder, and how the Sail gyb'd, and fill'd
this way, or that way, as the Course we sail'd chang'd; I say, when he
saw this, he stood like one, astonish'd and amaz'd: However, with a little
Use, I made all these Things familiar to him; and he became an expert Sailor,
except that as to the Compass, I could make him understand very little
of that. On the other hand, as there was very little cloudy Weather, and
seldom or never any Fogs in those Parts, there was the less occasion for
a Compass, seeing the Stars were always to be seen by Night, and the Shore
by Day, except in the rainy Seasons, and then no body car'd to stir abroad,
either by Land or Sea.

<P>I was now entred on the seven and twentieth Year of my Captivity in
this Place; though the three last Years that I had this Creature with me,
ought rather to be left out of the Account, my Habitation being quite of
another kind than in all the rest of the Time. I kept the Anniversary of
my Landing here with the same Thankfulness to God for his Mercies, as at
first; and if I had such Cause of Acknowledgment at first, I had much more
so now, having such additional Testimonies of the Care of Providence over
me, and the great Hopes I had of being effectually, and speedily deliver'd;
for I had an invincible Impression upon my Thoughts, that my Deliverance
was at hand, and that I should not be another Year in this Place: However,
I went on with my Husbandry, digging, planting, fencing, as usual; I gather'd
and cur'd my Grapes, and did every necessary Thing as before.

<P>The rainy Season was in the mean Time upon me, when I kept more within
Doors than at other Times; so I had stow'd our new Vessel as secure as
we could, bringing her up into the Creek, where as I said, in the Beginning
I landed my Rafts from the Ship, and haling her up to the Shore, at high
Water mark, I made my Man <I>Friday</I> dig a little Dock, just big enough
to hold her, and just deep enough to give her Water enough to fleet in;
and then when the Tide was out, we made a strong Dam cross the End of it,
to keep the Water out; and so she lay dry, as to the Tide from the Sea;
and to keep the Rain off, we laid a great many Boughs of Trees, so thick,
that she was as well thatch'd as a House; and thus we waited for the Month
of <I>November</I> and <I>December</I>, in which I design'd to make my
Adventure.

<P>When the settled Season began to come in, as the thought of my Design
return'd with the fair Weather, I was pre paring daily for the Voyage;
and the first Thing I did, was to lay by a certain Quantity of Provisions,
being the Stores for our Voyage; and intended in a Week or a Fortnight's
Time, to open the Dock, and launch out our Boat. I was busy one Morning
upon some Thing of this kind, when I call'd to <I>Friday</I>, and bid him
go to the Sea Shore, and see if he could find a Turtle, or Tortoise, a
Thing which we generally got once a Week, for the Sake of the Eggs, as
well as the Flesh: <I>Friday</I> had not been long gone, when he came running
back, and flew over my outer Wall, or Fence, like one that felt not the
Ground, or the Steps he set his Feet on; and before I had time to speak
to him, he cries out to me, <I>O Master! O Master! O Sorrow! O bad! </I>What's
the Matter, <I>Friday</I>? says I; <I>O yonder, there, </I>says he, <I>one,
two, three Canoe! one, two, three! </I>By his way of speaking, I concluded
there were six; but on enquiry, I found it was but three: Well, <I>Friday</I>,
says I, do not be frighted; so I heartned him up as well as I could: However,
I saw the poor Fellow was most terribly scar'd; for nothing ran in his
Head but that they were come to look for him, and would cut him in Pieces,
and eat him; and the poor Fellow trembled so, that I scarce knew what to
do with him: I comforted him as well as I could, and told him I was in
as much Danger as he, and that they would eat me as well as him; <I>but</I>,
says I, <I>Friday, we must resolve to fight them; Can you fight</I>, Friday?
<I>Me shoot, </I>says he, <I>but there come many great Number</I>. No matter
for that, said I again, our Guns will fright them that we do not kill;
so I ask'd him, Whether if I resolv'd to defend him, he would defend me,
and stand by me, and do just as I bid him? He said, <I>Me die, when you
bid die, Master</I>; so I went and fetch'd a good Dram of Rum, and gave
him; for I had been so good a Husband of my Rum, that had a great deal
left: When he had drank it, I made him take the two Fowling-Pieces, which
we always carry'd, and load them with large Swan-Shot, as big as small
Pistol Bullets; then I took four Muskets, and loaded them with two Slugs,
and five small Bullets each; and my two Pistols I loaded with a Brace of
Bullets each; I hung my great Sword as usual, naked by my Side, and gave
<I>Friday</I> his Hatchet.

<P>When I had thus prepar'd my self, I took my Perspective-Glass, and went
up to the Side of the Hill, to see what I could discover; and I found quickly,
by my Glass, that there were one and twenty Savages, three Prisoners, and
three <I>Canoes</I>; and that their whole Business seem'd to be the triumphant
Banquet upon these three humane Bodies, (a barbarous Feast indeed) but
nothing more than as I had observ'd was usual with them.

<P>I observ'd also, that they were landed not where they had done, when
<I>Friday</I> made his Escape; but nearer to my Creek, where the Shore
was low, and where a thick Wood came close almost down to the Sea: This,
with the Abhorrence of the inhumane Errand these Wretches came about, fill'd
me with such Indignation, that I came down again to <I>Friday</I>, and
told him, I was resolv'd to go down to them, and kill them all; and ask'd
him, If he would stand by me? He was now gotten over his Fright, and his
Spirits being a little rais'd, with the Dram I had given him, he was Cry
chearful, and told me, as before, <I>he would die, when I bid die.</I>

<P>In this Fit of Fury, I took first and divided the Arms which I had charg'd,
as before, between us; I gave <I>Friday</I> one Pistol to stick in his
Girdle, and three Guns upon his Shoulder; and I took one Pistol, and the
other three my self; and in this Posture we march'd out: I took a small
Bottle of Rum in my Pocket, and gave <I>Friday</I> a large Bag, with more
Powder and Bullet; and as to Orders, I charg'd him to keep close behind
me, and not to stir, or shoot, or do any Thing, till I bid him; and in
the mean Time, not to speak a Word: In this Posture I fetch'd a Compass
to my Right-Hand, of near a Mile, as well to get over the Creek, as to
get into the Wood; so that I might come within shoot of them, before I
should be discover'd, which I had seen by my Glass, it was easy to do.

<P>While I was making this March, my former Thoughts returning, I began
to abate my Resolution; I do not mean, that I entertain'd any Fear of their
Number; for as they were naked, unarm'd Wretches, 'tis certain I was superior
to them; nay, though I had been alone; but it occurr'd to my Thoughts,
What Call? What Occasion? much less, What Necessity I was in to go and
dip my Hands in Blood, to attack People, who had neither done, or intended
me any Wrong? Who as to me were innocent, and whose barbarous Customs were
their own Disaster, being in them a Token indeed of God's having left them,
with the other Nations of that Part of the World, to such Stupidity, and
to such inhumane Courses; but did not call me to take upon me to be a Judge
of their Actions, much less an Executioner of his Justice; that whenever
he thought fit, he would take the Cause into his own Hands, and by national
Vengeance punish them as a People, for national Crimes; but that in the
mean time, it was none of my Business; that it was true, <I>Friday</I>
might justify it, because he was a declar'd Enemy, and in a State of War
with those very particular People; and it was lawful for him to attack
them; but I could not say she same with respect to me: These Things were
so warmly press'd upon my Thoughts, all the way as I went, that I resolv'd
I would only go and place my self near them, that I might observe their
barbarous Feast, and that I would act then as God should direct; but that
unless something offer'd that was more a Call to me than yet I knew of,
I would not meddle with them.

<P>With this Resolution I enter'd the Wood, and with all possible Waryness
and Silence, <I>Friday</I> following close at my Heels, I march'd till
I came to the Skirt of the Wood, on the Side which was next to them; only
that one Corner of the Wood lay between me and them; here I call'd softly
to <I>Friday</I>, and shewing him a great Tree, which was just at the Corner
of the Wood, I bad him go to the Tree, and bring me Word if he could see
there plainly what they were doing; he did so, and came immediately back
to me, and told me they might be plainly view'd there; that they were all
about their Fire, eating the Flesh of one of their Prisoners; and that
another lay bound upon the Sand, a little from them, which be said they
would kill next, and which fir'd all the very Soul within me; he told me
it was not one of their Nation; but one of the bearded Men, who he had
told me of, that came to their Country in the Boat: I was fill'd with Horror
at the very naming the white-bearded Man, and going to the Tree, I saw
plainly by my Glass, a white Man who lay upon the Beach of the Sea, with
his Hands and his Feet ty'd, with Flags, or Things like Rushes; and that
he was an <I>European</I>, and had Cloaths on.

<P>There was another Tree, and a little Thicket beyond it, about fifty
Yards nearer to them than the Place where I was, which by going a little
way about, I saw I might come at undiscover'd, and that then I should be
within half Shot of them; so I with-held my Passion, though I was indeed
enrag'd to the highest Degree, and going back about twenty Paces, I got
behind some Bushes, which held all the way, till I came to the other Tree;
and then I came to a little rising Ground, which gave me a full View of
them, at the Distance of about eighty Yards.

<P>I had now not a Moment to loose; for nineteen of the dreadful Wretches
sat upon the Ground, all close huddled together, and had just sent the
other two to butcher the poor <I>Christian</I>, and bring him perhaps Limb
by Limb to their Fire, and they were stoop'd down to untie the Bands, at
his Feet; I turn'd to <I>Friday</I>, now <I>Friday</I>, said I, do as I
bid thee; <I>Friday</I> said he would; then <I>Friday</I>, says I, do exactly
as you see me do, 'fail in nothing; so I set down one of the Muskets, and
the Fowling-Piece, upon the Ground, and <I>Friday</I> did the like by his;
and with the other Musket, I took my aim at the Savages, bidding him do
the like; then asking him, If he was ready? He said, yes, then fire at
them, said I; and the same Moment I fir'd also.

<P><I>Friday</I> took his Aim so much better than I, that on the Side that
he shot, he kill'd two of them, and wounded three more; and on my Side,
I kill'd one, and wounded two: They were, you may be sure, in a dreadful
Consternation; and all of them, who were not hurt, jump'd up upon their
Feet, but did not immediately know which way to run, or which way to look;
for they knew not from whence their Destruction came: <I>Friday</I> kept
his Eyes close upon me, that as I had bid him, he might observe what I
did; so as soon as the first Shot was made, I threw down the Piece, and
took up the Fowling-Piece, and <I>Friday</I> did the like; he see me cock,
and present, he did the same again; Are you ready, <I>Friday</I>? said
I; yes, says he; let fly then, says I, in the Name of God, and with that
I fir'd again among the amaz'd Wretches, and so did <I>Friday</I>; and
as our Pieces were now loaden with what I call'd Swan-Shot, or small Pistol
Bullets, we found only two drop; but so many were wounded, that they run
about yelling, and skreaming, like mad Creatures, all bloody, and miserably
wounded, most of them; whereof three more fell quickly after, though not
quite dead.

<P>Now <I>Friday</I>, says I, laying down the discharg'd Pieces, and taking
up the Musket, which was yet loaden; follow me, says I, which he did, with
a great deal of Courage; upon which I rush'd out of the Wood, and shew'd
my self, and <I>Friday</I> close at my Foot; as soon as I perceiv'd they
saw me, I shouted as loud as I could, and bad <I>Friday</I> do so too;
and running as fast as I could, <I>which by the way, was not very fast,
being loaden with Arms as I was, </I>I made directly towards the poor Victim,
who was, as I said, lying upon the Beach, or Shore, between the Place where
they sat, and the Sea; the two Butchers who were just going to work with
him, had left him, at the Suprize of our first Fire, and fled in a terrible
Fright, to the Sea Side, and had jump'd into a Canoe, and three more of
the rest made the same way; I turn'd to <I>Friday</I>, and bid him step
forwards, and fire at them; he understood me immediately, and running about
forty Yards, to be near them, he shot at them, and I thought he had kill'd
them all; for I see them all fall of a Heap into the Boat; though I saw
two of them up again quickly: However, he kill'd two of them, and wounded
the third; so that he lay down in the Bottom of the Boat, as if he had
been dead.

<P>While my Man <I>Friday</I> fir'd at them, I pull'd out my Knife, and
cut the Flags that bound the poor Victim, and loosing his Hands, and Feet,
I lifted him up, and ask'd him in the <I>Portuguese</I> Tongue, What he
was? He answer'd in Latin, <I>Christianus</I>; but was so weak, and faint,
that he could scarce stand, or speak; I took my Bottle out of my Pocket,
and gave it him, making Signs that he should drink, which he did; and I
gave him a Piece of Bread, which he eat; then I ask'd him, What Countryman
he was? And he said, <I>Espagniole</I>; and being a little recover'd, let
me know by all the Signs he could possibly make, how much he was in my
Debt for his Deliverance; Seignior, said I, with as much <I>Spanish</I>
as I could make up, we will talk afterwards; but we must fight now; if
you have any Strength left, take this Pistol, and Sword, and lay about
you; he took them very thankfully, and no sooner had he the Arms in his
Hands, but as if they had put new Vigour into him, he flew upon his Murtherers,
like a Fury, and had cut two of them in Pieces, in an instant; for the
Truth is, as the whole was a Surprize to them; so the poor Creatures were
so much frighted with the Noise of our Pieces, that they fell down for
meer Amazement, and Fear; and had no more Power to attempt their own Escape,
than their Flesh had to resist our Shot; and that was the Case of those
Five that <I>Friday</I> shot at in the Boat; for as three of them fell
with the Hurt they receiv'd, so the other two fell with the Fright.

<P>I kept my Piece in my Hand still, without firing, being willing to keep
my Charge ready; because I had given the <I>Spaniard</I> my Pistol, and
Sword; so I call'd to <I>Friday</I>, and bad him run up to the Tree, from
whence we first fir'd, and fetch the Arms which lay there, that had been
discharg'd, which he did with great Swiftness; and then giving him my Musket,
I sat down my self to load all the rest again, and bad them come to me
when they wanted: While I was loading these Pieces, there happen'd a fierce
Engagement between the <I>Spaniard, </I>and one of the Savages, who made
at him with one of their great wooden Swords, the same Weapon that was
to have kill'd him before, if I had not prevented it: The <I>Spaniard,
</I>who was as bold, and as brave as could be imagin'd, though weak, had
fought this <I>Indian </I>a good while, and had cut him two great Wounds
on his Head; but the Savage being a stout lusty Fellow, closing in with
him, had thrown him down (being faint) and was wringing my Sword out of
his Hand, when the <I>Spaniard</I>, tho' undermost wisely quitting the
Sword, drew the Pistol from his Girdle, shot the Savage through the Body,
and kill'd him upon the Spot; before I, who was running to help him, could
come near him.

<P><I>Friday</I> being now left to his Liberty, pursu'd the flying Wretches
with no Weapon in his Hand, but his Hatchet; and with that he dispatch'd
those three, who, as I said before, were wounded at first and fallen, and
all the rest he could come up with, and the <I>Spaniard </I>coming to me
for a Gun, I gave him one of the Fowling-Pieces, with which he pursu'd
two of the Savages, and wounded them both; but as he was not able to run,
they both got from him into the Wood, where <I>Friday</I> pursu'd them,
and kill'd one of them; but the other was too nimble for him, and though
he was wounded, yet had plunged himself into the Sea, and swam with all
his might off to those two who were left in the <I>Canoe, </I>which three
in the <I>Canoe, </I>with one wounded, who we know not whether he dy'd
or no, were all that escap'd our Hands of one and twenty: The Account of
the Rest is as follows;
<BLOCKQUOTE>3 Kill'd at our first Shot from the Tree.
<BR>2 Kill'd at the next Shot.
<BR>2 Kill'd by <I>Friday</I> in the Boat.
<BR>2 Kill'd by Ditto, of those at first wounded.
<BR>1 Kill'd by Ditto, in the Wood.
<BR>3 Kill'd by the Spaniard.
<BR>4 Kill'd, being found dropp'd here and there of their Wounds, or
<BR>kill'd by <I>Friday</I> in his Chase of them.
<BR>4 Escap'd in the Boat, whereof one wounded if not dead.

<P>21 In all.</BLOCKQUOTE>
Those that were in the <I>Canoe</I>, work'd hard to get out of Gun-Shot;
and though <I>Friday</I> made two or three Shot at them, I did not find
that he hit any of them: <I>Friday</I> would fain have had me took one
of their <I>Canoes, </I>and pursu'd them; and indeed I was very anxious
about their Escape, least carrying the News home to their People, they
should come back perhaps with two or three hundred of their <I>Canoes,
</I>and devour us by meer Multitude; so I consented to pursue them by Sea,
and running to one of their <I>Canoes, </I>I jump'd in, and bad <I>Friday</I>
follow me; but when 1 was in the <I>Canoe, </I>I was surpriz'd to find
another poor Creature lye there alive, bound Hand and Foot, as the <I>Spaniard
</I>was, for the Slaughter, and almost dead with Fear, not knowing what
the Matter was; for he had not been able to look up over the Side of the
Boat, he was ty'd so hard, Neck and Heels, and had been ty'd so long, that
he had really but little Life in him.

<P>I immediately cut the twisted Flags, or Rushes, which they had bound
him with, and would have helped him up; but he could not stand, or speak,
but groan'd most piteously, believing it seems still that he was only unbound
in order to be kill'd.

<P>When <I>Friday</I> came to him, I bad him speak to him, and tell him
of his Deliverance, and pulling out my Bottle, made him give the poor Wretch
a Dram, which, with the News of his being deliver'd, reviv'd him, and he
sat up in the Boat; but when <I>Friday</I> came to hear him speak, and
look in his Face, it would have mov'd any one to Tears, to have seen how
<I>Friday</I> kiss'd him, embrac'd him, hugg'd him, cry'd, laugh'd, hollow'd,
jump'd about, danc'd, sung, then cry'd again, wrung his Hands, beat his
own Face, and Head, and then sung, and jump'd about again, like a distracted
Creature: It was a good while before I could make him speak to me, or tell
me what was the Matter; but when he came a little to himself, he told me,
that it was his Father.

<P>It is not easy for me to express how it mov'd me to see what Extasy
and filial Affection had work'd in this poor <I>Savage, </I>at the Sight
of his Father, and of his being deliver'd from Death; nor indeed can I
describe half the Extravagancies of his Affection after this; for he went
into the Boat and out of the Boat a great many times: When he went in to
him, he would sit down by him, open his Breast, and hold his Father's Head
close to his Bosom, half an Hour together, to nourish it; then he took
his Arms and Ankles, which were numb'd and stiff with the Binding, and
chaffed and rubbed them with his Hands; and I perceiving what the Case
was, gave him some Rum out of my Bottle, to rub them with, which did them
a great deal of Good.

<P>This Action put an End to our Pursuit of the Canoe, with the other <I>Savages,
</I>who were now gotten almost out of Sight; and it was happy for us that
we did not; for it blew so hard within two Hours after, and before they
could be gotten a Quarter of their Way, and continued blowing so hard all
Night, and that from the <I>North-west, </I>which was against them, that
I could not suppose their Boat could live, or that they ever reach'd to
their own Coast.

<P>But to return to <I>Friday</I>, he was so busy about his Father, that
I could not find in my Heart to take him off for some time: But after I
thought he could leave him a little, I call'd him to me, and he came jumping
and laughing, and pleas'd to the highest Extream; then I ask'd him, If
he had given his Father any Bread? He shook his Head, and said, <I>None:
Ugly Dog eat all up self; </I>so I gave him a Cake of Bread out of a little
Pouch I carry'd on Purpose; I also gave him a Dram for himself, but he
would not taste it, but carry'd it to his Father: I had in my Pocket also
two or three Bunches of my Raisins, so I gave him a Handful of them for
his Father. He had no sooner given his Father these Raisins, but I saw
him come out of the Boat, and run away, as if he had been bewitch'd, he
run at such a Rate; for he was the swiftest Fellow of his Foot that ever
I saw; I say, he run at such a Rate, that he was out of Sight, as it were,
in an instant; and though I call'd, and hollow'd too, after him, it was
all one, away he went, and in a Quarter of an Hour, I saw him come back
again, though not so fast as he went; and as he came nearer, I found his
Pace was slacker, because he had some thing in his Hand.

<P>When he came up to me, I found he had been quite Home for an Earthen
Jugg or Pot to bring his Father some fresh Water, and that he had got two
more Cakes, or Loaves of Bread: The Bread he gave me, but the Water he
carry'd to his Father: However, as I was very thirsty too, I took a little
Sup of it. This Water reviv'd his Father more than all the Rum or Spirits
I had given him; for he was just fainting with Thirst.

<P>When his Father had drank, I call'd to him to know if there was any
Water left; he said, yes; and I bad him give it to the poor <I>Spaniard,
</I>who was in as much Want of it as his Father; and I sent one of the
Cakes, that <I>Friday</I> brought, to the <I>Spaniard </I>too, who was
indeed very weak, and was reposing himself upon a green Place under the
Shade of a free; and whose Limbs were also very stiff, and very much swell'd
with the rude Bandage he had been ty'd with. When I saw that upon <I>Friday's
</I>coming to him with the Water, he sat up and drank, and took the Bread,
and began to eat, I went to him, and gave him a Handful of Raisins; he
look'd up in my Face with all the Tokens of Gratitude and Thankfulness,
that could appear in any Countenance; but was so weak, notwithstanding
he had so exerted himself in the Fight, that he could not stand up upon
his Feet; he try'd to do it two or three times, but was really not able,
his Ankles were so swell'd and so painful to him; so I bad him sit still,
and caused <I>Friday</I> to rub his Ankles, and bathe them with Rum, as
he had done his Father's.

<P>I observ'd the poor affectionate Creature every two Minutes, or perhaps
less, all the while he was here, turn'd his Head about, to see if his Father
was in the same Place, and Posture, as he left him sitting; and at last
he found he was not to be seen; at which he started up, and without speaking
a Word, flew with that Swiftness to him, that one could scarce perceive
his Feet to touch the Ground, as he went: But when he came, he only found
he had laid himself down to ease his Limbs; so <I>Friday</I> came back
to me presently, and I then spoke to the Spaniard to let <I>Friday</I>
help him up if he could, and lead him to the Boat, and then he should carry
him to our Dwelling, where I would take Care of him: But <I>Friday</I>,
a lusty strong Fellow, took the <I>Spaniard </I>quite up upon his Back,
and carry'd him away to the Boat, and set him down softly upon the Side
or Gunnel of the Canoe, with his Feet in the inside of it, and then lifted
him quite in, and set him close to his Father, and presently stepping out
again, launched the Boat off, and paddled it along the Shore faster than
I could walk, tho' the Wind blew pretty hard too; so he brought them both
safe into our Creek; and leaving them in the Boat, runs away to fetch the
other Canoe. As he pass'd me, I spoke to him, and ask'd him, whither he
went, he told me, <I>Go fetch more Boat; </I>so away he went like the Wind;
for sure never Man or Horse run like him, and he had the other Canoe in
the Creek, almost as soon as I got to it by Land; so he wafted me over,
and then went to help our new Guests out of the Boat, which he did; but
they were neither of them able to walk; so that poor <I>Friday</I> knew
not what to do.
