<P>When I was come down the Hill, to the Shore, as I said above, being
the <I>S.W.</I> Point of the Island, I was perfectly confounded and amaz'd;
nor is it possible for me to express the Horror of my Mind, at seeing the
Shore spread with Skulls, Hands, Feet, and other Bones of humane Bodies;
and particularly I observ'd a Place where there had been a Fire made, and
a Circle dug in the Earth, like a Cockpit, where it is suppos'd the Savage
Wretches had sat down to their inhumane Feastings upon the Bodies of their
Fellow-Creatures. I was so astonish'd with the Sight of these Things, that
I entertain'd no Notions of any Danger to my self from it for a long while;
All my Apprehensions were bury'd in the Thoughts of such a Pitch of inhuman,
hellish Brutality, and the Horror of the Degeneracy of Humane Nature; which
though I had heard of often, yet I never had so near a View of before;
in short, I turn'd away my Face from the horrid Spectacle; my Stomach grew
sick, and I was just at the Point of Fainting, when Nature discharg'd the
Disorder from my Stomach; and having vomited with an uncommon violence,
I was a little reliev'd; but cou'd not bear to stay in the Place a Moment;
so I gat me up the Hill again, with the Speed I cou'd, and walk'd on towards
my own Habitation.

<P>When I came a little out of that Part of the Island, I stood a while
as amaz'd; and then recovering my self, I look'd with the utmost Affection
of my Soul, and with a Flood Tears in my Eyes, gave God Thanks that had
cast my Lot in a Part of the World, where I was distinguish'd from such
dreadful Creatures as these; and that though I had esteem'd my present
Condition very miserable, had yet given me so many Comforts in it, that
I had still more to give Thanks for than to complain of; and this above
all, that had even in this miserable Condition been comforted with the
Knowledge of himself, and the Hope of his Blessing, which was a Felicity
more than sufficiently equivalent to all the Misery which I had suffer'd,
or could suffer.

<P>In this Frame of Thankfulness, I went Home to my Castle, and began to
be much easier now, as to the Safety my Circumstances, than ever I was
before; for I observ'd, that these Wretches never came to this Island in
search of what they could get; perhaps not seeking, not wanting, or not
expecting any Thing here; and having often, no doubt, been up in the cover'd
woody Part of it, without finding any Thing to their Purpose. I knew I
had been here now almost eighteen Years, and never saw the least Foot-steps
of Humane Creature there before; and I might be here eighteen more, as
entirely conceal'd as I was now, if I did not discover my self to them,
which I had no manner of Occasion to do, it being my only Business to keep
my self entirely conceal'd where I was, unless I found a better sort of
Creatures than <I>Canibals</I> to make my self known to.

<P>Yet I entertain'd such an Abhorrence of the Savage Wretches, that I
have been speaking of, and of the wretched inhuman Custom of their devouring
and eating one another up, that I continu'd pensive, and sad, and kept
close within my own Circle for almost two Years after this: When I say
my own Circle, I mean by it, my three Plantations, <I>viz.</I> my Castle,
my Country Seat, which I call'd my Bower, and my Enclosure in the Woods;
nor did I look after this for any other Use than as an Enclosure for my
Goats; for the Aversion which Nature gave me to these hellish Wretches,
was such, that I was fearful of seeing them, as of seeing the Devil himself;
nor did I so much as go to look after my Boat, in all this Time; but began
rather to think of making me another; for I cou'd not think of ever making
any more Attempts, to bring the other Boat round the Island to me, least
I should meet with some of these Creatures at Sea, in which, if I had happen'd
to have fallen into their Hands, I knew what would have been my Lot.

<P>Time however, and the Satisfaction I had, that I was in no Danger of
being discover'd by these People, began to wear off my Uneasiness about
them; and I began to live just in the same compos'd Manner as before; only
with this Difference, that I used more Caution, and kept my Eyes more about
me than I did before, least I should happen to be seen by any of them;
and particularly, I was more cautious of firing my Gun, least any of them
being on the Island, should happen to hear of it; and it was therefore
a very good Providence to me, that I had furnish'd my self with a tame
Breed of Goats, that I needed not hunt any more about the Woods, or shoot
at them; and if I did catch any of them after this, it was by Traps, and
Snares, as I had done before; so that for two Years after this, I believe
I never fir'd my Gun once off, though I never went out without it; and
which was more, as I had sav'd three Pistols out of the Ship, I always
carry'd them out with me, or at least two of them, sticking them in my
Goat-skin Belt; also I furbish'd up one of the great Cutlashes, that I
had out of the Ship, and made me a Belt to put it on also; so that I was
now a most formidable Fellow to look at, when I went abroad, if you add
to the former Description of my self, the Particular of two Pistols, and
a great broad Sword, hanging at my Side in a Belt, but without a Scabbard.

<P>Things going on thus, as I have said, for some Time; I seem'd, excepting
these Cautions, to be reduc'd to my former calm, sedate Way of Living,
all these Things tended to shewing me more and more how far my Condition
was from being miserable, compar'd to some others; nay, to many other Particulars
of Life, which it might have pleased God to have made my Lot. It put me
upon reflecting, How little repining there would be among Mankind, at any
Condition of Life, if People would rather compare their Condition with
those that are worse, in order to be thankful, than be always Comparing
them with those which are better, to assist their Murmurings and Complainings.

<P>As in my present Condition there were not really many Things which I
wanted; so indeed I thought that the Frights I had been in about these
Savage Wretches, and the Concern I had been in for my own Preservation,
had taken off the Edge of my Invention for my own Conveniences; and I had
dropp'd a good Design, which I had once bent my Thoughts too much upon;
and that was, to try if I could not make some of my Barley into Malt, and
then try to brew my self some Beer: This was really a whimsical Thought,
and I reprov'd my self often for the Simplicity of it; for I presently
saw there would be the want of several Things necessary to the making my
Beer, that it would be impossible for me to supply; as First, Casks to
preserve it in, which was a Thing, that as I have observ'd already, I cou'd
never compass; no, though I spent not many Days, but Weeks, nay, Months
in attempting it, but to no purpose. In the next Place, I had no Hops to
make it keep, no Yeast to make it work, no Copper or Kettle to make it
boil; and yet all these Things, notwithstanding, I verily believe, had
not these Things interven'd, I mean the Frights and Terrors I was in about
the Savages, I had undertaken it, and perhaps brought it to pass too; for
I seldom gave any Thing over without accomplishing it, when I once had
it in my Head enough to begin it.

<P>But my Invention now run quite another Way; for Night and Day, I could
think of nothing but how I might destroy some of these Monsters in their
cruel bloody Entertainment, and if possible, save the Victim they should
bring hither to destroy. It would take up a larger Volume than this whole
Work is intended to be, to set down all the Contrivances I hatch'd, or
rather brooded upon in my Thought, for the destroying these Creatures,
or at least frighting them, so as to prevent their coming hither any more;
but all was abortive, nothing could be possible to take effect, unless
I was to be there to do it my self; and what could one Man do among them,
when perhaps there might be twenty or thirty of them together, with their
Darts, or their Bows and Arrows, with which they could shoot as true to
a Mark, I could with my Gun?

<P>Sometime I contriv'd to dig a Hole under the Place where they made their
Fire, and put in five or six Pound of Gun-powder, which when they kindled
their Fire, would consequently take Fire, and blow up all that was near
it; but as in the first Place I should be very loth to wast so much Powder
upon them, my Store being now within the Quantity of one Barrel; so neither
could I be sure of its going off' at any certain Time, when it might surprise
them, and at best, that it would do little more than just blow the Fire
about their Ears and fright them, but not sufficient to make them forsake
the Place; so I laid it aside, and then propos'd, that I would place my
self in Ambush, in some convenient Place, with my three Guns, all double
loaded; and in the middle of their bloody Ceremony, let fly at them, when
I should be sure to kill or wound perhaps two or three at every shoot;
and then falling in upon them with my three Pistols, and my Sword, I made
no doubt, but that if there was twenty I should kill them all: This Fancy
pleas'd my Thoughts for some Weeks, and I was so full of it, that I often
dream'd of it; and sometimes that I was just going to let fly at them in
my Sleep.

<P>I went so far with it in my Imagination, that I employ'd my self several
Days to find out proper Places to put my self in Ambuscade, as I said,
to watch for them; and I went frequently to the Place it self, which was
now grown more familiar to me; and especially while my Mind was thus fill'd
with Thoughts of Revenge, and of a bloody putting twenty or thirty of them
to the Sword, as I may call it, the Horror I had at the Place, and at the
Signals of the barbarous Wretches devouring one another, abated my Malice.

<P>Well, at length I found a Place in the Side of the Hill, where I was
satisfy'd I might securely wait, till I saw any of their Boats coming,
and might then, even before they would be ready to come on Shore, convey
my self unseen into Thickets of Trees, in one of which there was a Hollow
large enough to conceal me entirely; and where I might sit, and observe
all their bloody Doings, and take my full aim at their Heads, when they
were so close together, as that it would be next to impossible that I should
miss my Shoot, or that I could fail wounding three or four of them at the
first Shoot.

<P>In this Place then I resolv'd to fix my Design, and accordingly I prepar'd
two Muskets, and my ordinary Fowling Piece. The two Muskets I loaded with
a Brace of Slugs each, and four or five smaller Bullets, about the Size
of Pistol Bullets; and the Fowling Piece I loaded with near a Handful of
Swan-shot, of the largest Size; I also loaded my Pistols with about four
Bullets each, and in this Posture, well provided with Ammunition for a
second and third Charge, I prepar'd my self for my Expedition.

<P>After I had thus laid the Scheme of my Design, and in my Imagination
put it in Practice, I continually made my Tour every Morning up to the
Top of the Hill, which was from my Castle, as I call'd it, about three
Miles, or more, to see if I cou'd observe any Boats upon the Sea, coming
near the Island, or standing over towards it; but I began to tire of this
hard Duty, after I had for two or three Months constantly kept my Watch;
but came always back without any Discovery, there having not in all that
Time been the least Appearance, not only on, or near the Shore; but not
on the whole Ocean, so far as my Eyes or Glasses could reach every Way.

<P>As long as I kept up my daily Tour to the Hill, to look out; so long
also I kept up the Vigour of my Design, and my Spirits seem'd to be all
the while in a suitable Form, for so outragious an Execution as the killing
twenty or thirty naked Savages, for an Offence which I had not at all entred
into a Discussion of in my Thoughts, any farther than my Passions were
at first fir'd by the Horror I conceiv'd at the natural Custom of that
People of the Country, who it had been suffer'd by Providence in his wise
Disposition of the World, to have no other Guide than that of their own
abominable and vitiated Passions; and constantly were left, and perhaps
had been so for some Ages, to act: horrid Things, and receive such dreadful
Customs, as nothing but Nature entirely abandon'd of Heaven, and acted
by hellish Degeneracy, could have run them into: But now, as I have said,
I began to be weary of the fruitless Excursion, which I had made so long,
and so far, every Morning in vain, so my Opinion of the Action it self
began to alter, and I began with cooler and calmer Thoughts to consider
what it was I was going to engage in. What Authority, or Call I had, to
pretend to be Judge and Executioner upon these Men as Criminals, whom Heaven
had thought fit for so many Ages to suffer unpunish'd, to go on, and to
be as it were, the Executioners of his Judgments one upon another. How
far these People were Offenders against me, and what Right I had to engage
in the Quarrel of that Blood, which they shed promiscuously one upon another.
I debated this very often with my self thus; How do I know what God himself
judges in this particular Case? is certain these People either do not commit
this as a Crime; it is not against their own Consciences reproving, or
their Light reproaching them. They do not know it be Offence, and then
commit it in Defiance of Divine Justice, we do in almost all the Sins we
commit. They think it no ore a Crime to kill a Captive taken in War, than
we do kill an Ox; nor to eat humane Flesh, than we do to eat Mutton.

<P>When I had consider'd this a little, it follow'd necessarily, that I
was certainly in the Wrong in it, that these People were not Murtherers
in the Sense that I had before condemn'd them, in my Thoughts; any more
than those Christians were Murtherers, who often put to Death the Prisoners
taken in Battle; or more frequently, upon many Occasions, put whole Troops
of Men to the Sword, without giving Quarter, though they threw down their
Arms and submitted.

<P>In the next Place it occurr'd to me, that albeit the Usage they thus
gave one another, was thus brutish and inhuman; yet it was really nothing
to me: These People had done me Injury. That if they attempted me, or I
saw it necessary my immediate Preservation to fall upon them, something
might be said for it; but that as I was yet out of their Power, and they
had really no Knowledge of me, and consequently sign upon me; and therefore
it could not be just for to fall upon them. That this would justify the
Conduct the <I>Spaniards</I> in all their Barbarities practis'd in <I>America</I>,
and where they destroy'd Millions of these People, who however they were
Idolaters and Barbarians, and had several bloody and barbarous Rites in
their Customs, such as sacrificing human Bodies to their Idols, were yet,
as to the <I>Spaniards</I>, very innocent People; and that the rooting
them out of the Country, is spoken of with the utmost Abhorrence and Detestation,
by even the <I>Spaniards</I> themselves, at this Time; and by all other
Christian Nations of <I>Europe</I>, as a meer Butchery, a bloody and unnatural
Piece of Cruelty, unjustifiable either to God or Man; and such, as for
which the very Name of a <I>Spaniard</I> is reckon'd to be frightful and
terrible to all People of Humanity, or of Christian Compassion: As if the
Kingdom of <I>Spain</I> were particularly Eminent for the Product of a
Race of Men, who were without Principles of Tenderness, or the common Bowels
of Pity to the Miserable, which is reckon'd to be a Mark of generous Temper
in the Mind.

<P>These Considerations really put me to a Pause, and to a kind of a Full-stop;
and I began by little and little to be off of my Design, and to conclude,
I had taken wrong Measures in my Resolutions to attack the Savages; that
it was not my Business to meddle with them, unless they first attack'd
me, and this it was my Business if possible to prevent; but that if I were
discover'd, and attack'd, then I knew my Duty.

<P>On the other hand, I argu'd with my self, That this really was the way
not to deliver my self, but entirely to ruin and destroy my self; for unless
I was sure to kill every one that not only should be on Shore at that Time,
but that should ever come on Shore afterwards, if but one of them escap'd,
to tell their Country People what had happen'd, they would come over again
by Thousands to revenge the Death of their Fellows, and 1 should only bring
upon my self a certain Destruction, which at present I had no manner of
occasion for.

<P>Upon the whole I concluded, That neither in Principle or in Policy,
I ought one way or other to concern my self in this Affair. That my Business
was by all possible Means to conceal my self from them, and not to leave
the least Signal to them to guess by, that there were any living Creatures
upon the Island; I mean of humane Shape.

<P>Religion joyn'd in with this Prudential, and I was convinc'd now many
Ways, that I was perfectly out of my Duty, when I was laying all my bloody
Schemes for the Destruction of innocent Creatures, I mean innocent as to
me: As to the Crimes they were guilty of towards one another, I had nothing
to do with them; they were National, and I ought to leave them to the Justice
of God, who is the Governour of Nations, and knows how by National Punishments
to make a just Retribution for National Offences; and to bring publick
Judgments upon those who offend in a publick Manner, by such Ways as best
pleases him.

<P>This appear'd so clear to me now, that nothing was a greater Satisfaction
to me, than that I had not been suffer'd to do a Thing which I now saw
so much Reason to believe would have been no less a Sin, than that of wilful
Murther, if I had committed it; and I gave most humble Thanks on my Knees
to God, that had thus deliver'd me from Blood-Guiltiness; beseeching him
to grant me the Protection of his Providence, that I might not fall into
the Hands of the Barbarians; or that I might not lay my Hands upon them,
unless I had a more clear Call from Heaven to do it, in Defence of my own
Life.

<P>In this Disposition I continu'd, for near a Year after this; and so
far was I from desiring an Occasion for falling upon these Wretches, that
in all that Time, I never once went up the Hill to see whether there were
any of them in Sight, or to know whether any of them had been on Shore
there, or not, that I might not be tempted to renew any of my Contrivances
against them, or be provok'd by any Advantage which might present it self,
to fall upon them; only this I did I went and remov'd my Boat, which I
had on the other Side the Island, and carry'd it down to the <I>East</I>
End of the whole Island, where I ran it into a little Cove which I found
under some high Rocks, and where I knew, by Reason of the Currents, the
Savages durst not, at least would not come with their Boats, upon any Account
whatsoever.

<P>With my Boat I carry'd away every Thing that I had left there belonging
to her, though not necessary for the bare going thither, <I>viz</I>. A
Mast and Sail which I had made for her, and a Thing like an Anchor, but
indeed which could not be call'd either Anchor or Grapling; however, it
was the best I could make of its kind: All these I remov'd, that there
might not be the least Shadow of any Discovery, or any Appearance of any
Boat, or of any human Habitation upon the Island.

<P>Besides this, I kept my self, as I said, more retir'd than ever, and
seldom went from my Cell, other than upon my constant Employment, viz.
To milk my She-goats, and manage my little Flock, in the Wood; which as
it was quite on the other Part of the Island, was quite out of Danger;
for certain it is, that these Savage People who sometimes haunted this
Island, never came with any Thoughts of finding any Thing here; and consequently
never wandred off from the Coast; and I doubt not, but they might have
been several Times on Shore, after my Apprehensions of them had made me
cautious as well as before; and indeed, I look'd back with some Horror
upon the Thoughts of what my Condition would have been, if I had chop'd
upon them, and been discover'd before that, when naked and unarm'd, except
with one Gun, and that loaden often only with small Shot, I walk'd every
where peeping, and peeping about the Island, to see what I could get; what
a Surprise should I have been in, if when I discover'd the Print of a Man's
Foot, I had instead of that, seen fifteen or twenty Savages, and found
them pursuing me, and by the Swiftness of their Running, no Possibility
of my escaping them.

<P>The Thoughts of this sometimes sunk my very Soul within me, and distress'd
my Mind so much, that I could not soon recover it, to think what I should
have done, and how I not only should not have been able to resist them,
but even should not have had Presence of Mind enough to do what I might
have done; much less, what now after so much Consideration and Preparation
I might be able to do: Indeed, after serious thinking of these Things,
I should be very Melancholly, and sometimes it would last a great while;
but I resolv'd it at last all into Thankfulness to that Providence, which
had deliver'd me from so many unseen Dangers, and had kept me from those
Mischiefs which I could no way have been the Agent in delivering my self
from; because I had not the least Notion of any such Thing depending,'
or the least Supposition of it being possible.

<P>This renew'd a Contemplation, which often had come to my Thoughts in
former Time, when first I began to see the merciful Dispositions of Heaven,
in the Dangers we run through in this Life. How wonderfully we are deliver'd,
when we know nothing of it. How when we are in (a <I>Quandary</I>, as we
call it) a Doubt or Hesitation, whether to go this Way, or that Way, a
secret Hint shall direct us this Way, when we intended to go that Way;
nay, when Sense, our own Inclination, and perhaps Business has call'd to
go the other Way, yet a strange Impression upon the Mind, from we know
not what Springs, and by we know not what Power, shall over-rule us to
go this Way; and it shall afterwards appear, that had we gone that Way
which we should have gone, and even to our Imagination ought to have gone,
we should have been ruin'd and lost: Upon these, and many like Reflections,
I afterwards made it a certain Rule with me, That whenever I found those
secret Hints, or pressings of my Mind, to doing, or not doing any Thing
that presented; or to going this Way, or that Way, I never fail'd to obey
the secret Dictate; though I knew no other Reason for it, than that such
a Pressure, or such a Hint hung upon my Mind: I could give many Examples
of the Success of this Conduct in the Course of my Life; but more especially
in the latter Part of my inhabiting this unhappy Island; besides many Occasions
which it is very likely I might have taken Notice of, if I had seen with
the same Eyes then, that I saw with now: But 'tis never too late to be
wise; and I cannot but advise all considering Men, whose Lives are attended
with such extraordinary Incidents as mine, or even though not so extraordinary,
not to slight such secret Intimations of Providence, let them come from
what invisible Intelligence they will, that' I shall not discuss, and perhaps
cannot account for; but certainly they are a Proof of the Converse of Spirits,
and the secret Communication between those embody'd, and those unembody'd;
and such a Proof as can never be withstood: Of which I shall have Occasion
to give some very remarkable Instances, in the Remainder of my solitary
Residence in this dismal Place.

<P>I believe the Reader of this will not think strange, if I confess that
these Anxieties, these constant Dangers I liv'd in, and the Concern that
was now upon me, put an End to all Invention, and to all the Contrivances
that I had laid for my future Accommodations and Conveniencies. I had the
Care of my Safety more now upon my Hands, than that of my Food. I car'd
not to drive a Nail, or chop a Stick of Wood now, for fear the Noise I
should make should be heard; much less would I fire a Gun, for the same
Reason; and above all, I was intollerably uneasy at making any Fire, least
the Smoke which is visible at a great Distance in the Day should betray
me; and for this Reason I remov'd that Part of my Business which requir'd
Fire; such as burning of Pots, and Pipes, <I>etc</I>. into my new Apartment
in the Woods, where after I had been some time, I found to my unspeakable
Consolation, a meer natural Cave in the Earth, which went in a vast way,
and where, I dare say, no Savage, had he been at the Mouth of it, would
be so hardy as to venture in, nor indeed, would any Man else; but one who
like me, wanted nothing so much as a safe Retreat.

<P>The Mouth of this Hollow, was at the Bottom of a great Rock, where by
meer accident, (I would say, if I did not see abundant Reason to ascribe
all such Things now to Providence) I was cutting down some thick Branches
of Trees, to make Charcoal; and before I go on, I must observe the Reason
of my making this Charcoal; which was thus: I was afraid of making a Smoke
about my Habitation, as I said before; and yet I could not live there without
baking my Bread, cooking my Meat, <I>etc</I>. so I contriv'd to burn some
Wood here, as I had seen done in <I>England</I>, under Turf, till it became
Chark, or dry Coal; and then putting the Fire out, I preserv'd the Coal
to carry Home; and perform the other Services which Fire was wanting for
at Home without Danger of Smoke.

<P>But this is by the by: While I was cutting down some Wood here, I perceiv'd
that behind a very thick Branch of low Brushwood, or Underwood, there was
a kind of hollow Place; I was curious to look into it, and getting with
Difficulty into the Mouth of it, I found it was pretty large; that is to
say, sufficient for me to stand upright in it, and perhaps another with
me; but I must confess to you, I made more hast out than I did in, when
looking farther into the Place, and which was perfectly dark, I saw two
broad shining Eyes of some Creature, whether Devil or Man I knew not, which
twinkl'd like two Stars, the dim Light from the Cave's Mouth shining directly
in and making the Reflection.

<P>However, after some Pause, I recover'd my self, and began to call my
self a thousand Fools, and tell my self, that he that was afraid to see
the Devil, was not fit to live twenty Years in an Island all alone; and
that I durst to believe there was nothing in this Cave that was more frightful
than my self; upon this, plucking up my Courage, I took up a great Firebrand,
and in I rush'd again, with the Stick flaming in my Hand; I had not gone
three Steps in, but I was almost as much frighted as I was before; for
I heard a very loud Sigh, like that of a Man in some Pain, and it was follow'd
by a broken Noise, as if of Words half express'd, and then a deep Sigh
again: I stepp'd back, and was indeed struck with such a Surprize, that
it put me into a cold Sweat; and if I had had a Hat on my Head, I will
not answer for it, that my Hair might not have lifted it off. But still
plucking up my Spirits as well as I could, and encouraging my self a little
with considering that the Power and Presence of God was every where, and
was able to protect me; upon this I stepp'd forward again, and by the Light
of the Firebrand, holding it up a little over my Head, I saw lying on the
Ground a most monstrous frightful old He-goat, just making his Will, as
we say, and gasping for Life, and dying indeed of meer old Age.

<P>I stirr'd him a little to see if I could get him out, and he essay'd
to get up, but was not able to raise himself; and I thought with my self,
he might even lie there; for if he had frighted me so, he would certainly
fright any of the Savages, if any of them should be so hardy as to come
in there, while he had any Life in him.

<P>I was now recover'd from my Surprize, and began to look round me, when
I found the Cave was but very small, that is to say, it might be about
twelve Foot over, but in no manner of Shape, either round or square, no
Hands having ever been employ'd in making it, but those of meer Nature:
I observ'd also, that there was a Place at the farther Side of it, that
went in farther, but was so low, that it requir'd me to creep upon my Hands
and Knees to go into it, and whither I went I knew not; so having no Candle,
I gave it over for some Time; but resolv'd to come again the next Day,
provided with Candles, and a Tinder-box, which I had made of the Lock of
one of the Muskets, with some wild-fire in the Pan.

<P>Accordingly the next Day, I came provided with six large Candles of
my own making; for I made very good Candles now of Goat's Tallow; and going
into this low Place, I was oblig'd to creep upon all Fours, <I>as I have
said</I>, almost ten Yards; which by the way, I thought was a Venture bold
enough, considering that I knew not how far it might go, nor what was beyond
it. When I was got through the Strait, I found the Roof rose higher up,
I believe near twenty Foot; but never was such a glorious Sight seen in
the Island, I dare say, as it was, to look round the Sides and Roof of
this Vault, or Cave; the Walls reflected 100 thousand Lights to me from
my two Candles; what it was in Rock, whether Diamonds, or any other precious
Stones, or Gold, which I rather suppos'd it to be, I knew not.

<P>The Place I was in, was a most delightful Cavity, or Grotto, of its
kind, as could be expected, though perfectly dark; the Floor was dry and
level, and had a sort of small lose Gravel upon it, so that there was no
nauseous or venemous Creature to be seen, neither was there any damp, or
wet, on the Sides or Roof: The only Difficulty in it was the Entrance,
which however as it was a Place of Security, and such a Retreat as I wanted,
I thought that was a Convenience; so that I was really rejoyc'd at the
Discovery, and resolv'd without any Delay, to bring some of those Things
which I was most anxious about, to this Place; particularly, I resolv'd
to bring hither my Magazine of Powder, and all my spare Arms, <I>viz.</I>
Two Fowling-Pieces, for I had three in all; and three Muskets, for of them
I had eight in all; so I kept at my Castle only five, which stood ready
mounted like Pieces of Cannon, on my out-most Fence; and were ready also
to take out upon any Expedition.

<P>Upon this Occasion of removing my Ammunition, I took occasion to open
the Barrel of Powder which I took up out of the Sea, and which had been
wet; and I found that the Water had penetrated about three or four Inches
into the Powder, on every Side, which caking and growing hard, had preserv'd
the inside like a Kernel in a Shell; so that I had near sixty Pound of
very good Powder in the Center of the Cask, and this was an agreeable Discovery
to me at that Time; so I carry'd all away thither, never keeping above
two or three Pound of Powder with me in my Castle, for fear of a Surprize
of any kind: I also carry'd thither all the Lead I had Belt for Bullets.

<P>I fancy'd my self now like one of the ancient Giants, which are said
to live in Caves, and Holes, in the Rocks, where none could come at them;
for I perswaded my self while I was here, if five hundred Savages were
to hunt me, they could never find me out; or if they did, they would not
venture to attack me here.

<P>The old Goat who I found expiring, dy'd in the Mouth of the Cave, the
next Day after I made this Discovery; and I found it much easier to dig
a great Hole there, and throw him in, and cover him with Earth, than to
drag him out; so I interr'd him there, to prevent the Offence to my Nose.

<P>I was now in my twenty third Year of Residence in this Island, and was
so naturaliz'd to the Place, and to the Manner of Living, that could I
have but enjoy'd the Certainty that no Savages would come to the Place
to disturb me, I could have been content to have capitulated for spending
the rest of my Time there, even to the last Moment, till I had laid me
down and dy'd, like the old Goat in the Cave. I had also arriv'd to some
little Diversions and Amusements, which made the Time pass more pleasantly
with me a great deal, than it did before; as First, I had taught my Poll,
as I noted before, to speak; and he did it so familiarly, and talk'd so
articulately and plain, that it was very pleasant to me; and he liv'd with
me no less than six and twenty Years: How long he might live afterwards,
I know not; though I know they have a Notion in the <I>Brasils</I>, that
they live a hundred Years; perhaps poor Poll may be alive there still,
calling after <I>Poor Robin Crusoe</I> to this Day. I wish no <I>English</I>
Man the ill Luck to come there and hear him; but if he did, he would certainly
believe it was the Devil. My Dog was a very pleasant and loving Companion
to me, for no less than sixteen Years of my Time, and then dy'd, of meer
old Age; as for my Cats, they multiply'd as I have observ'd to that Degree,
that I was oblig'd to shoot several of them at first, to keep them from
devouring me, and all I had; but at length, when the two old Ones I brought
with me were gone, and after some time continually driving them from me,
and letting them have no Provision with me, they all ran wild into the
Woods, except two or three Favourites, which I kept tame; and whose Young
when they had any, I always drown'd; and these were part of my Family:
Besides these, I always kept two or three houshold Kids about me, who I
taught to feed out of my Hand; and I had two more Parrots which talk'd
pretty well, and would all call <I>Robin Crusoe</I>; but none like my first;
nor indeed did I take the Pains with any of them that I had done with him.
I had also several tame Sea-Fowls, whose Names I know not, who I caught
upon the Shore, and cut their Wings; and the little Stakes which I had
planted before my Castle Wall being now grown up to a good thick Grove,
these Fowls all liv'd among these low Trees, and bred there, which was
very agreeable to me; so that as I said above, I began to be very well
contented with the Life I led, if it might but have been secur'd from the
dread of the Savages.

<P>But it was otherwise directed; and it may not be amiss for all People
who shall meet with my Story, to make this just Observation from it, vis.
How frequently in the Course of our Lives, the Evil which in it self we
seek most to shun, and which when we are fallen into it, is the most dreadful
to us, is oftentimes the very Means or Door of our Deliverance, by which
alone we can be rais'd again from the Affliction we are fallen into. I
cou'd give many Examples of this in the Course of my unaccountable Life;
but in nothing was it more particularly remarkable, than in the Circumstances
of my last Years of solitary Residence in this Island.

<P>It was now the Month of <I>December</I>, as I said above, in my twenty
third Year; and this being the <I>Southern</I> Solstice, for Winter I cannot
call it, was the particular Time of my Harvest, and requir'd my being pretty
much abroad in the Fields; when going out pretty early in the Morning,
even before it was thorow Day-light, I was surpriz'd with seeing a Light
of some Fire upon the Shore, at a Distance from me, of about two Mile towards
the End of the Island, where I had observ'd some Savages had been as before;
but not on the other Side; but to my great Affliction, it was on my Side
of the Island.

<P>I was indeed terribly surpriz'd at the Sight, and stepp'd short within
my Grove, not daring to go out, least I might be surpriz'd; and yet I had
no more Peace within, from the Apprehensions I had, that if these Savages
in rambling over the Island, should find my Corn standing, or cut, or any
of my Works and Improvements, they would immediately conclude, that there
were People in the Place, and would then never give over till they had
found me out: In this Extremity I went back directly to my Castle, pull'd
up the Ladder after me, and made all Things without look as wild and natural
as I could.

<P>Then I prepar'd my self within, putting my self in a Posture of Defence;
I loaded all my Cannon, as I call'd them; that is to say, my Muskets, which
were mounted upon my new Fortification, and all my Pistols, and resolv'd
to defend my self to the last Gasp, not forgetting seriously to commend
my self to the Divine Protection, and earnestly to pray to God to deliver
me out of the Hands of the Barbarians; and in this Posture I continu'd
about two Hours; but began to be mighty impatient for Intelligence abroad,
for I had no Spies to send out.

<P>After sitting a while longer, and musing what I should do in this Case,
I was not able to bear sitting in Ignorance any longer; so setting up my
Ladder to the Side of the Hill, where there was a flat Place, as I observ'd
before, and then pulling the Ladder up after me, I set it up again, and
mounted to the Top of the Hill; and pulling out my Perspective Glass, which
I had taken on Purpose, I laid me down flat on my Belly, on the Ground,
and began to look for the Place; I presently found there was no less than
nine naked Savages, sitting round a small Fire, they had made, not to warm
them; for they had no need of that, the Weather being extreme hot; but
as I suppos'd, to dress some of their barbarous Diet, of humane Flesh,
which they had brought with them, whether alive or dead I could not know.

<P>They had two <I>Canoes</I> with them, which they had haled up upon the
Shore; and as it was then Tide of Ebb, they seem'd to me to wait for the
Return of the Flood, to go away again; it is not easy to imagine what Confusion
this Sight put me into, especially seeing them come on my Side the Island,
and so near me too; but when I observ'd their coming must be always with
the Current of the Ebb, I began afterwards to be more sedate in my Mind,
being satisfy'd that I might go abroad with Safety all the Time of the
Tide of Flood, if they were not on Shore before: And having made this Observation,
I went abroad about my Harvest Work with the more Composure.

<P>As I expected, so it prov'd; for as soon as the Tide made to the <I>Westward</I>,
I saw them all take Boat, and row (or paddle as we call it) all away: I
should have observ'd, that for an Hour and more before they went off, they
went to dancing, and I could easily discern their Postures, and Gestures,
by my Glasses: I could not perceive by my nicest Observation, but that
they were stark naked, and had not the least covering upon them; but whether
they were Men or Women, that I could not distinguish.

<P>As soon as I saw them shipp'd, and gone, I took two Guns upon my Shoulders,
and two Pistols at my Girdle, and my great Sword by my Side, without a
Scabbard, and with all the Speed I was able to make, I went away to the
Hill, where I had discover'd the first Appearance of all; and as soon as
I gat thither, which was not less than two Hours (for I could not go apace,
being so loaden with Arms as I was) I perceiv'd there had been three <I>Canoes</I>
more of Savages on that Place; and looking out farther, I saw they were
all at Sea together, making over for the Main.

<P>This was a dreadful Sight to me, especially when going down to the Shore,
I could see the Marks of Horror, which the dismal Work they had been about
had left behind it, <I>viz.</I> The Blood, the Bones, and part of the Flesh
of humane Bodies, eaten and devour'd by those Wretches, with Merriment
and Sport: I was so fill'd with Indignation at the Sight, that I began
now to premeditate the Destruction of the next that I saw there, let them
be who, or how many soever.

<P>It seem'd evident to me, that the Visits which they thus make to this
Island, are not very frequent; for it was above fifteen Months before any
more of them came on Shore there again; that is to say, I neither saw them,
or any Footsteps, or Signals of them, in all that Time; for as to the rainy
Seasons, then they are sure not to come abroad, at least not so far; yet
all this while I liv'd uncomfortably, by reason of the constant Apprehensions
I was in of their coming upon me by Surprize; from whence I observe, that
the Expectation of Evil is more bitter than the Suffering, especially if
there is no room to shake off that Expectation, or those Apprehensions.

<P>During all this Time, I was in the murthering Humour; and took up most
of my Hours, which should have been better employ'd, in contriving how
to circumvent, and fall upon them, the very next Time I should see them;
especially if they should be divided, as they were the last Time, into
two Parties; nor did I consider at all, that if I kill'd one Party, suppose
Ten, or a Dozen, I was still the next Day, or Week, or Month, to kill another,
and so another, even <I>ad infinitum</I>, till I should be at length no
less a Murtherer than they were in being Man-eaters; and perhaps much more
so.

<P>I spent my Days now in great Perplexity, and Anxiety of Mind, expecting
that I should one Day or other fall into the Hands of these merciless Creatures;
and if I did at any Time venture abroad, it was not without looking round
me with the greatest Care and Caution imaginable; and now I found to my
great Comfort, how happy it was that I provided for a tame Flock or Herd
of Goats; for I durst not upon any account fire my Gun, especially near
that Side of the Island where they usually came, least I should alarm the
Savages; and if they had fled from me now, I was sure to have them come
back again, with perhaps two or three hundred <I>Canoes</I> with them,
in a few Days, and then I knew what to expect.

<P>However, I wore out a Year and three Months more, before I ever saw
any more of the Savages, and then I found them again, as I shall soon observe.
It is true, they might have been there once, or twice; but either they
made no stay, or at least I did not hear them; but in the Month of <I>May</I>,
as near as I could calculate, and in my four and twentieth Year, I had
a very strange Encounter with them, of which in its Place.

<P>The Perturbation of my Mind, during this fifteen or sixteen Months Interval,
was very great; I slept unquiet, dream'd always frightful Dreams, and often
started out of my Sleep in the Night: In the Day great Troubles overwhelm'd
my Mind, and in the Night I dream'd often of killing the Savages, and of
the Reasons why I might justify the doing of it; but to wave all this for
a while; it was in the middle of <I>May</I>, on the sixteenth Day I think,
as well as my poor wooden Calendar would reckon; for I markt all upon the
Post still; I say, it was the sixteenth of <I>May</I>, that it blew a very
great Storm of Wind, all Day, with a great deal of Lightning, and Thunder,
and a very foul Night it was after it; I know not what was the particular
Occasion of it; but as I was reading in the Bible, and taken up with very
serious Thoughts about my present Condition, I was surpriz'd with a Noise
of a Gun as I thought fir'd at Sea.

<P>This was to be sure a Surprize of a quite different Nature from any
I had met with before; for the Notions this put into my Thoughts, were
quite of another kind. I started up in the greatest hast imaginable, and
in a trice clapt my Ladder to the middle Place of the Rock, and pull'd
it after me, and mounting it the second Time, got to the Top of the Hill,
the very Moment, that a Flash of Fire bid me listen for a second Gun, which
accordingly, in about half a Minute I heard; and by the sound, knew that
it was from that Part of the Sea where I was driven down the Current in
my Boat.

<P>I immediately consider'd that this must be some Ship in Distress, and
that they had some Comrade, or some other Ship in Company, and fir'd these
Guns for Signals of Distress, and to obtain Help: I had this Presence of
Mind at that Minute, as to think that though I could not help them, it
may be they might help me; so I brought together all the dry Wood I could
get at hand, and making a good handsome Pile, I set it on Fire upon the
Hill; the Wood was dry, and blaz'd freely; and though the Wind blew very
hard, yet it burnt fairly out; that I was certain, if there was any such
Thing as a Ship, they must needs see it, and no doubt they did; for as
soon as ever my Fire blaz'd up, I heard another Gun, and after that several
others, all from the same Quarter; I ply'd my Fire all Night long, till
Day broke; and when it was broad Day, and the Air clear'd up, I saw something
at a great Distance at Sea, full <I>East</I> of the Island, whether a Sail,
or a Hull, I could not distinguish, no not with my Glasses, the Dna was
so great, and the Weather still something haizy also; at least it was so
out at Sea.

<P>I look'd frequently at it all that Day, and soon perceiv'd that it did
not move; so I presently concluded, that it was a Ship at an Anchor, and
being eager, you may be sure, to be satisfy'd, I took my Gun in my Hand,
and run toward the <I>South</I> Side of the Island, to the Rocks where
I had formerly been carry'd away with the Current, and getting up there,
the Weather by this Time being perfectly clear, I could plainly see to
my great Sorrow, the Wreck of a Ship cast away in the Night, upon those
concealed Rocks which I found, when I was out in my Boat; and which Rocks,
as they check'd the Violence of the Stream, and made a kind of Counter-stream,
or Eddy, were the Occasion of my recovering from the most desperate hopeless
Condition that ever I had been in, in all my Life.

<P>Thus what is one Man's Safety, is another Man's Destruction; for it
seems these Men, whoever they were, being out of their Knowledge, and the
Rocks being wholly under Water, had been driven upon them in the Night,
the Wind blowing hard at E. and <I>E.N.E</I>: Had they seen the Island,
as I must necessarily suppose they did not, they must, as I thought, have
endeavour'd to have sav'd themselves on Shore by the Help of their Boat;
but their firing of Guns for Help, especially when they saw, as I imagin'd,
my Fire, fill'd me with many Thoughts: First, I imagin'd that upon seeing
my Light, they might have put themselves into their Boat, and have endeavour'd
to make the Shore; but that the Sea going very high, they might have been
cast away; other Times I imagin'd, that they might have lost their Boat
before, as might be the Case many Ways; as particularly by the Breaking
of the Sea upon their Ship, which many Times obliges Men to stave, or take
in Pieces their Boat; and sometimes to throw it over-board with their own
Hands: Other Times I imagin'd, they had some other Ship, or Ships in Company,
who upon the Signals of Distress they had made, had taken them up, and
carry'd them off: Other whiles I fancy'd, they were all gone off to Sea
in their Boat, and being hurry'd away by the Current that I had been formerly
in, were carry'd out into the great Ocean, where there was nothing but
Misery and Perishing; and that perhaps they might by this Time think of
starving, and of being in a Condition to eat one another.

<P>As all these were but Conjectures at best; so in the Condition I was
in, I could do no more than look on upon the Misery of the poor Men, and
pity them, which had still this good Effect on my Side, that it gave me
more and more Cause to give Thanks to God who had so happily and comfortably
provided for me in my desolate Condition; and that of two Ships Companies
who were now cast away upon this part of the World, not one Life should
be spar'd but mine: I learn'd here again to observe, that it is very rare
that the Providence of God casts us into any Condition of Life so low,
or any Misery so great, but we may see something or other to be thankful
for; and may see others in worse Circumstances than our own.

<P>Such certainly was the Case of these Men, of whom I could not so much
as see room to suppose any of them were sav'd; nothing could make it rational,
so much as to wish, or expect that they did not all perish there; except
the Possibility only of their being taken up by another Ship in Company,
and this was but meer Possibility indeed; for I saw not the least Signal
or Appearance of any such Thing.

<P>I cannot explain by any possible Energy of Words, what a strange longing
or hankering of Desires I felt in my Soul upon this Sight; breaking out
sometimes thus; O that there had been but one or two; nay, or but one Soul
sav'd out of this Ship, to have escap'd to me, that I might but have had
one Companion, one Fellow-Creature to have spoken to me, and to have convers'd
with! In all the Time of my solitary Life I never felt so earnest, so strong
a Desire after the Society of my Fellow-Creatures, or so deep a Regret
at the want of it.

<P>There are some secret moving Springs in the Affections, which when they
are set a going by some Object in view, or be it some Object, though not
in view, yet rendred present to the Mind by the Power of Imagination, that
Motion' carries out the Soul by its Impetuosity to such violent eager embracings
of the Object, that the Absence of it is insupportable.

<P>Such were these earnest Wishings, That but one Man had been sav'd! <I>O
that it had been but One</I>! I believe I repeated the Words, <I>O that
it had been but One</I>! A thousand Times; and the Desires were so mov'd
by it, that when I spoke the Words, my Hands would clinch together, and
my Fingers press the Palms of my Hands, that if I had had any soft Thing
in my Hand, it wou'd have crusht it involuntarily; and my Teeth in my Head
wou'd strike together, and set against one another so strong, that for
some time I cou'd not part them again.

<P>Let the Naturalists explain these Things, and the Reason and Manner
of them; all I can say to them, is, to describe the Fact, which was even
surprising to me when I found it; though I knew not from what it should
proceed; it was doubtless the effect of ardent Wishes, and of strong Ideas
form'd in my Mind, realizing the Comfort, which the Conversation of one
of my Fellow-Christians would have been to me.

<P>But it was not to be; either their Fate or mine, or both, forbid it;
for till the last Year of my being on this Island, I never knew whether
any were saved out of that Ship or no; and had only the Affliction some
Days after, to see the Corps of a drownded Boy come on Shore, at the End
of the Island which was next the Shipwreck: He had on no Cloaths, but a
Seaman's Wastcoat, a pair of open knee'd Linnen Drawers, and a blew Linnen
Shirt; but nothing to direct me so much as to guess what Nation he was
of: He had nothing in his Pocket, but two Pieces of Eight, and a Tobacco
Pipe; the last was to me of ten times more value than the first.

<P>It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture out in my Boat, to
this Wreck; not doubting but I might find something on board, that might
be useful to me; but that did not altogether press me so much, as the Possibility
that there might be yet some living Creature on board, whose Life I might
not only save, but might by saving that Life, comfort my own to the last
Degree; and this Thought clung so to my Heart, that I could not be quiet,
Night or Day, but I must venture out in my Boat on board this Wreck; and
committing the rest to God's Providence, I thought the Impression was so
strong upon my Mind, that it could not be resisted, that it must come from
some invisible Direction, and that I should be wanting to my self if I
did not go.

<P>Under the Power of this Impression, I hasten'd back to my Castle, prepar'd
every Thing for my Voyage, took a Quantity of Bread, a great Pot for fresh
Water, a Compass to steer by, a Bottle of Rum; for I had still a great
deal of that left; a Basket full of Raisins: And thus loading my self with
every Thing necessary, I went down to my Boat, got the Water out of her,
and got her afloat, loaded all my Cargo in her, and then went Home again
for more; my second Cargo was a great Bag full of Rice, the Umbrella to
set up over my Head for Shade; another large Pot full of fresh Water, and
about two Dozen of my small Loaves, or Barley Cakes, more than before,
with a Bottle of Goats-Milk, and a Cheese; all which, with great Labour
and Sweat, I brought to my Boat; and praying to God to direct my Voyage,
I put out, and Rowing or Padling the Canoe along the Shore, I came at last
to the utmost Point of the Island on that Side, (<I>viz</I>.) <I>N. E</I>.
And now I was to launch out into the Ocean, and either to venture, or not
to venture. I look'd on the rapid Currents which ran constantly on both
Sides of the Island, at a Distance, and which were very terrible to me,
from the Remembrance of the Hazard I had been in before, and my Heart began
to fail me; for I foresaw that if I was driven into either of those Currents,
I should be carry'd a vast Way out to Sea, and perhaps out of my Reach,
or Sight of the Island again; and that then, as my Boat was but small,
if any little Gale of Wind should rise, I should be inevitably lost.

<P>These Thoughts so oppress'd my Mind, that I began to give over my Enterprize,
and having haled my Boat into a little Creek on the Shore, I stept out,
and sat me down upon a little rising bit of Ground, very pensive and anxious,
between Fear and Desire about my Voyage; when as I was musing, I could
perceive that the Tide was turn'd, and the Flood come on, upon which my
going was for so many Hours impracticable; upon this presently it occurr'd
to me, that I should go up to the highest Piece of Ground I could find,
and observe, if I could, how the Sets of the Tide, or Currents lay, when
the Flood came in, that I might judge whether if I was driven one way out,
I might not expect to be driven another way home, with the same Rapidness
of the Currents: This Thought was no sooner in my Head, but I cast my Eye
upon a little Hill, which sufficiently over-look'd the Sea both ways, and
from whence I had a clear view of the Currents, or Sets of the Tide, and
which way I was to guide my self in my Return; here I found, that as the
Current of the Ebb set out close by the South Point of the Island; so the
Current of the Flood set in close by the Shore of the North Side, and that
I had nothing to do but to keep to the North of the Island in my Return,
and I should do well enough.

<P>Encourag'd with this Observation, I resolv'd the next Morning to set
out with the first of the Tide; and reposing my self for the Night in the
Canoe, under the great Watch-coat, I mention'd, I launched out: I made
first a little out to Sea full North, till I began to feel the Benefit
of the Current, which set Eastward, and which carry'd me at a great rate,
and yet did not so hurry me as the Southern Side Current had done before,
and so as to take from me all Government of the Boat; but having a strong
Steerage with my Paddle, I went at a great rate, directly for the Wreck,
and in less than two Hours I came up to it.

<P>It was a dismal Sight to look at: The Ship, which by its building was
<I>Spanish</I>, stuck fast, jaum'd in between two Rocks; all the Stern
and Quarter of her was beaten to pieces, with the Sea; and as her Forecastle,
which stuck in the Rocks, had run on with great Violence, her Mainmast
and Foremast were brought by the Board; that is to say, broken short off;
but her Boltsprit was found, and the Head and Bow appear'd firm; when I
came close to her, a Dog appear'd upon her, who seeing me coming, yelp'd,
and cry'd; and as soon as I call'd him, jump'd into the Sea, to come to
me, and I took him into the Boat; but found him almost dead for Hunger
and Thirst: I gave him a Cake of my Bread, and he eat it like a ravenous
Wolf, that had been starving a Fortnight in the Snow: I then gave the poor
Creature some fresh Water, with which, if I would have let him, he would
have burst himself.

<P>After this I went on board; but the first Sight I met with, was two
Men drown'd, in the Cookroom, or Forecastle of the Ship, with their Arms
fast about one another: I concluded, as is indeed probable, that when the
Ship struck, it being in a Storm, the Sea broke so high, and so continually
over her, that the Men were not able to bear it, and were strangled with
the constant rushing in of the Water, as much as if they had been under
Water. Besides the Dog, there was nothing left in the Ship that had Life;
nor any Goods that I could see, but what were spoil'd by the Water. There
were some Casks of Liquor, whether Wine or Brandy, I knew not, which lay
lower in the Hold; and which, the Water being ebb'd out, I could see; but
they were too big to meddle with: I saw several Chests, which I believ'd
belong'd to some of the Seamen; and I got two of them into the Boat, without
examining what was in them.

<P>Had the Stern of the Ship been fix'd, and the Forepart broken off, I
am perswaded I might have made a good Voyage; for by what I found in these
two Chests, I had room to suppose, the Ship had a great deal of Wealth
on board; and if I may guess by the Course she steer'd, she must have been
bound from the <I>Buenos Ayres</I>, or the <I>Rio de la Plata</I>, in the
South Part of <I>America</I>, beyond the <I>Brasils</I>, to the <I>Havana</I>,
in the Gulph of <I>Mexico</I>, and so perhaps to <I>Spain:</I> She had
no doubt a great Treasure in her; but of no use at that time to any body;
and what became of the rest of her People, I then knew not.

<P>I found besides these Chests, a little Cask full of Liquor, of about
twenty Gallons, which I got into my Boat, with much Difficulty; there were
several Muskets in a Cabin, and a great Powder-horn, with about 4 Pounds
of Powder in it; as for the Muskets, I had no occasion for them; so I left
them, but took the Powder-horn: I took a Fire Shovel and Tongs, which I
wanted extremely; as also two little Brass Kettles, a Copper Pot to make
Chocolate, and a Gridiron; with this Cargo, and the Dog, I came away, the
Tide beginning to make home again; and the same Evening, about an Hour
within Night, I reach'd the Island again, weary and fatigu'd to the last
Degree.

<P>I repos'd that Night in the Boat, and in the Morning I resolved to harbour
what I had gotten in my new Cave, not to carry it home to my Castle. After
refreshing my self, I got all my Cargo on Shore, and began to examine the
Particulars: The Cask of Liquor I found to be a kind of Rum, but not such
as we had at the Brasils; and in a Word, not at all good; but when I came
to open the Chests, I found several Things, of great use to me: For Example,
I found in one, a fine Case of Bottles, of an extraordinary kind, and fill'd
with Cordial Waters, fine, and very good; the Bottles held about three
Pints each, and were tipp'd with Silver: I found two Pots of very good
Succades, or Sweetmeats, so fastned also on top, that the Salt Water had
not hurt them; and two more of the same, which the Water had spoil'd: I
found some very good Shirts, which were very welcome to me; and about a
dozen and half of Linnen white Handkerchiefs, and colour'd Neckcloths;
the former were also very welcome, being exceeding refreshing to wipe my
Face in a hot Day; besides this, when I came to the Till in the Chest,
I found there three great Bags of Pieces of Eight, which held about eleven
hundred Pieces in all; and in one of them, wrapt up in a Paper, six Doubloons
of Gold, and some small Bars or Wedges of Gold; I suppose they might all
weigh near a Pound.

<P>The other Chest I found had some Cloaths in it, but of little Value;
but by the Circumstances it must have belong'd to the Gunner's Mate; though
there was no Powder in it; but about two Pound of fine glaz'd Powder, in
three small Flasks, kept, I suppose, for charging their Fowling-Pieces
on occasion: Upon the whole, I got very little by this Voyage, that was
of any use to me; for as to the Money, I had no manner of occasion for
it: 'Twas to me as the Dirt under my Feet; and I would have given it all
for three or four pair of <I>English</I> Shoes and Stockings, which were
Things I greatly wanted, but had not had on my Feet now for many Years:
I had indeed gotten two pair of Shoes now, which I took off of the Feet
of the two drown'd Men, who I saw in the Wreck; and I found two pair more
in one of the Chests, which were very welcome to me; but they were not
like our <I>English</I> Shoes, either for Ease, or Service; being rather
what we call Pumps, than Shoes: I found in this Seaman's Chest, about fifty
Pieces of Eight in Ryals, but no Gold; I suppose this belong'd to a poorer
Man than the other, which seem'd to belong to some Officer.

<P>Well, however, I lugg'd this Money home to my Cave, and laid it up,
as I had done that before, which I brought from our own Ship; but it was
great Pity as I said, that the over Part of this Ship had not come to my
Share; for I am satisfy'd I might have loaded my <I>Canoe</I> several Times
over with Money, which if I had ever escap'd to <I>England</I>, would have
lain here safe enough, till I might have come again and fetch'd it.

<P>Having now brought all my Things on Shore, and secur'd them, I went
back to my Boat, and row'd, or paddled her along the Shore, to her old
Harbour, where I laid her up, and made the best of my way to my old Habitation,
where I found every thing safe and quiet; so I began to repose my self,
live after my old fashion, and take care of my Family Affairs; and for
a while, I liv'd easy enough; only that I was more vigilant than I us'd
to be, look'd out oftner, and did not go abroad so much; and if at any
time I did stir with any Freedom, it was always to the <I>East</I> Part
of the Island, where I was pretty well satisfy'd the Savages never came,
and where I could go without so many Precautions, and such a Load of Arms
and Ammunition, as I always carry'd with me, if I went the other way.

<P>I liv'd in this Condition near two Years more; but my unlucky Head,
that was always to let me know it was born to make my Body miserable, was
all this two Years fill'd with Projects and Designs, how, if it were possible,
I might get away from this Island; for sometimes I was for making another
Voyage to the Wreck, though my Reason told me that there was nothing left
there, worth the Hazard of my Voyage: Sometimes for a Ramble one way, sometimes
another; and I believe verily, if I had had the Boat that I went from <I>Sallee</I>
in, I should have ventur'd to Sea, bound any where, I knew not whither.

<P>I have been in all my Circumstances a <I>Memento</I> to those who are
touch'd with the general Plague of Mankind, whence, for ought I know, one
half of their Miseries flow; I mean, that of not being satisfy'd with the
Station wherein God and Nature has plac'd them; for not to look back upon
my primitive Condition, and the excellent Advice of my Father, the Opposition
to which, was, <I>as I may call it</I>, my ORIGINAL SIN; my subsequent
Mistakes of the same kind had been the Means of my coming into this miserable
Condition; for had that Providence, which so happily had seated me at the
<I>Brasils</I>, as a Planter, bless'd me with confin'd Desires, and I could
have been contented to have gone on gradually, I might have been by this
Time; <I>I mean, in the Time of my being in this Island</I>, one of the
most considerable Planters in the <I>Brasils</I>, nay, I am perswaded,
that by the Improvements I had made, in that little Time I liv'd there,
and the Encrease I should probably have made, if I had stay'd, I might
have been worth an hundred thousand <I>Moydors</I>; and what Business had
I to leave a settled Fortune, a well stock'd Plantation, improving and
encreasing, to turn <I>Supra-Cargo</I> to <I>Guinea</I>, to fetch Negroes;
when Patience and Time would have so encreas'd our Stock at Home, that
we could have bought them at our own Door, from those whose Business it
was to fetch them; and though it had cost us something more, yet the Difference
of that Price was by no Means worth saving, at so great a Hazard.

<P>But as this is ordinarily the Fate of young Heads, so Reflection upon
the Folly of it, is as ordinarily the Exercise of more years, or of the
dear bought Experience of Time; and so it was with me now; and yet so deep
had the Mistake taken root in my Temper, that I could not satisfy my self
in my Station, but was continually poring upon the Means, and Possibility
of my Escape from this Place; and that I may with the greater Pleasure
to the Reader, bring on the remaining Part of my Story, it may not be improper,
to give some Account of my first Conceptions on the Subject of this foolish
Scheme, for my Escape; and how, and upon what Foundation I acted.

<P>I am now to be suppos'd retir'd into my Castle, after my late Voyage
to the Wreck, my Frigate laid up, and secur'd under Water, as usual, and
my Condition restor'd to what it was before: I had more Wealth indeed than
I had before, but was not at all the richer; for I had no more use for
it, than the <I>Indians</I> of <I>Peru</I> had, before the <I>Spaniards</I>
came there.

<P>It was one of the Nights in the rainy Season in <I>March</I>, the four
and twentieth Year of my first setting Foot in this Island of Solitariness;
I was lying in my Bed, or Hammock, awake, very well in Health, had no Pain,
no Distemper, no Uneasiness of Body; no, nor any Uneasiness of Mind, more
than ordinary; but could by no means close my Eyes; that is, so as to sleep;
no, not a Wink all Night long, otherwise than as follows:

<P>It is as impossible, as needless, to set down the innumerable Crowd
of Thoughts that whirl'd through that great thorow-fare of the Brain, the
Memory, in this Night's Time: I run over the whole History of my Life in
Miniature, or by Abridgment, <I>as I may call it</I>, to my coming to this
Island; and also of the Part of my Life, since I came to this Island. In
my Reflections upon the State of my Case, since I came on Shore on this
Island, I was comparing the happy Posture of my Affairs, in the first Years
of my Habitation here, compar'd to the Life of Anxiety, Fear and Care,
which I had liv'd ever since I had seen the Print of a Foot in the Sand;
not that I did not believe the Savages had frequented the Island even all
the while, and might have been several Hundreds of them at Times on Shore
there; but I had never known it, and was incapable of any Apprehensions
about it; my Satisfaction was perfect, though my Danger was the same; and
I was as happy in not knowing my Danger, as if I had never really been
expos'd to it: This furnish'd my Thoughts with many very profitable Reflections,
and particularly this one, How infinitely Good that Providence is, which
has provided in its Government of Mankind, such narrow bounds to his Sight
and Knowledge of Things, and though he walks in the midst of so many thousand
Dangers, the Sight of which, if discover'd to him, would distract his Mind,
and sink his Spirits; he is kept serene, and calm, by having the Events
of Things hid from his Eyes, and knowing nothing of the Dangers which surround
him.

<P>After these Thoughts had for some Time entertain'd me, I came to reflect
seriously upon the real Danger I had been In, for so many Years, in this
very Island; and how I had walk'd about in the greatest Security, and with
all possible Tranquillity; even when perhaps nothing but a Brow of a Hill,
a great Tree, or the casual Approach of Night, had been between me and
the worst kind of Destruction, <I>viz.</I> That of falling into the Hands
of Cannibals, and Savages, who would have seiz'd on me with the same View,
as I did of a Goat, or a Turtle; and have thought it no more a Crime to
kill and devour me, than I did of a Pidgeon, or a Curlieu: I would unjustly
slander my self, if I should say I was not sincerely thankful to my great
Preserver, to whose singular Protection I acknowledg'd, with great Humility,
that all these unknown Deliverances were due; and without which, I must
inevitably have fallen into their merciless Hands.

<P>When these Thoughts were over, my Head was for some time taken up in
considering the Nature of these wretched Creatures; I mean, the Savages;
and how it came to pass in the World, that the wise Governour of all Things
should give up any of his Creatures to such Inhumanity; nay, to something
so much below, even Brutality it self, as to devour its own kind; but as
this ended in some (at that Time fruitless) Speculations, it occurr'd to
me to enquire, what Part of the World these Wretches liv'd in; how far
off the Coast was from whence they came; what they ventur'd over so far
from home for; what kind of Boats they had; and why I might not order my
self, and my Business so, that I might be as able to go over thither, as
they were to come to me.

<P>I never so much as troubl'd my self to consider what I should do with
my self, when I came thither; what would become of me, if I fell into the
Hands of the Savages; or how I should escape from them, if they attempted
me; no, nor so much as how it was possible for me to reach the Coast, and
not be attempted by some or other of them, without any Possibility of delivering
my self; and if I should not fall into their Hands, what I should do for
Provision, or whither I should bend my Course; none of these Thoughts,
I say, so much as came in my way; but my Mind was wholly bent upon the
Notion of my passing over in my Boat, to the Main Land: I look'd back upon
my present Condition, as the most miserable that could possibly be, that
I was not able to throw my self into any thing but Death, that could be
call'd worse; that if I reached the Shore of the Main, I might perhaps
meet with Relief, or I might coast along, as I did on the Shore of <I>Africk</I>,
till I came to some inhabited Country, and where I might find some Relief;
and after all perhaps, I might fall in with some Christian Ship, that might
take me in; and if the worse came to the worst, I could but die, which
would put an end to all these Miseries at once. Pray note, all this was
the fruit of a disturb'd Mind, an impatient Temper, made as it were desperate
by the long Continuance of my Troubles, and the Disappointments I had met
in the Wreck, I had been on board of; and where I had been so near the
obtaining what I so earnestly long'd for, <I>viz</I>. Some-body to speak
to, and to learn some Knowledge from of the Place where I was, and of the
probable Means of my Deliverance; I say, I was agitated wholly by these
Thoughts: All my Calm of Mind in my Resignation to Providence, and waiting
the Issue of the Dispositions of Heaven, seem'd to be suspended; and I
had, as it were, no Power to turn my Thoughts to any thing, but to the
Project of a Voyage to the Main, which came upon me with such Force, and
such an Impetuosity of Desire, that it was not to be resisted.

<P>When this had agitated my Thoughts for two Hours, or more, with such
Violence, that it set my very Blood into a Ferment, and my Pulse beat as
high as if I had been in a Feaver, meerly with the extraordinary Fervour
of my Mind about it; Nature, as if I had been fatigued and exhausted with
the very Thought of it, threw me into a sound Sleep; one would have thought,
I should have dream'd of it: But I did not, nor of any Thing relating to
it; but I dream'd, that as I was going out in the Morning as usual from
my Castle, I saw upon the Shore, two <I>Canoes</I>, and eleven Savages
coming to Land, and that they brought with them another Savage, who they
were going to kill, in Order to eat him; when on a sudden, the Savage that
they were going to kill, jumpt away, and ran for his Life; and I thought
in my Sleep, that he came running into my little thick Grove, before my
Fortification, to hide himself; and that I seeing him alone, and not perceiving
that the other sought him that Way, show'd my self to him, and smiling
upon him, encourag'd him; that he kneel'd down to me, seeming to pray me
to assist him; upon which I shew'd my Ladder, made him go up, and carry'd
him into my Cave, and he became my Servant; and that as soon as I had gotten
this Man, I said to my self, now I may certainly venture to the main Land;
for this Fellow will serve me as a Pilot, and will tell me what to do,
and whether to go for Provisions; and whether not to go for fear of being
devoured, what Places to venture into, and what to escape: I wak'd with
this Thought, and was under such inexpressible Impressions of Joy, at the
Prospect of my Escape in my Dream, that the Disappointments which I felt
upon coming to my self, and finding it was no more than a Dream, were equally
extravagant the other Way, and threw me into a very great Dejection of
Spirit.

<P>Upon this however, I made this Conclusion, that my Only Way to go about
an Attempt for an Escape, was, if possible, to get a Savage into my Possession;
and if possible, it should be one of their Prisoners, who they had condemn'd
to be eaten, and should bring thither to kill; but these Thoughts still
were attended with this Difficulty, that it was impossible to effect this,
without attacking a whole Caravan of them, and killing them all; and this
was not only a very desperate Attempt, and might miscarry; but on the other
Hand, I had greatly scrupled the Lawfulness of it to me; and my Heart trembled
at the thoughts of shedding so much Blood, tho' it was for my Deliverance.
I need not repeat the Arguments which occurr'd to me against this, they
being the same mention'd before; but tho' I had other Reasons to offer
now (<I>viz</I>.) that those Men were Enemies to my Life, and would devour
me, if they could; that it was Self-preservation in the highest Degree,
to deliver my self from this Death of a Life, and was acting in my own
Defence, as much as if they were actually assaulting me, and the like.
I say, tho' these Things argued for it, yet the Thoughts of shedding Humane
Blood for my Deliverance, were very Terrible to me, and such as I could
by no Means reconcile my self to, a great while.

<P>However at last, after many secret Disputes with my self, and after
great Perplexities about it, for all these Arguments one Way and another
struggl'd in my Head a long Time, the eager prevailing Desire of Deliverance
at length master'd all the rest; and I resolv'd, if possible, to get one
of those Savages into my Hands, cost what it would. My next Thing then
was to contrive how to do it, and this indeed was very difficult to resolve
on: But as I could pitch upon no probable Means for it, so I resolv'd to
put my self upon the Watch, to see them when they came on Shore, and leave
the rest to the Event, taking such Measures as the Opportunity should present,
let be what would be.

<P>With these Resolutions in my Thoughts, I set my self upon the Scout,
as often as possible, and indeed so often till I was heartily tir'd of
it, for it was above a Year and Half that I waited, and for great part
of that Time went out to the <I>West</I> End, and to the <I>South West</I>
Corner of the Island, almost every Day, to see for Canoes, but none appear'd.
This was very discouraging, and began to trouble me much, tho' I cannot
say that it did in this Case, as it had done some time before that, (<I>viz</I>.)
wear off the Edge of my Desire to the Thing. But the longer it seem'd to
be delay'd, the more eager I was for it; in a Word, I was not at first
so careful to shun the sight of these Savages, and avoid being seen by
them, as I was now eager to be upon them.

<P>Besides, I fancied my self able to manage One, nay, Two or Three Savages,
if I had them so as to make them entirely Slaves to me, to do whatever
I should direct them, and to prevent their being able at any time to do
me any Hurt. It was a great while, that I pleas'd my self with this Affair,
but nothing still presented; all my Fancies and Schemes came to nothing,
for no Savages came near me for a great while.
