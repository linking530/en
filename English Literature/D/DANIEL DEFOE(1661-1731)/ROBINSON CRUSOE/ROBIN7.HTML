<P>To remedy this, I went to Work in my Thought, and calling to Friday
to bid them sit down on the Bank while he came to me, I soon made a Kind
of Hand-Barrow to lay them on, and <I>Friday</I> and I carry'd them up
both together upon it between us: But when we got them to the outside of
our Wall or Fortification, we were at a worse Loss than before; for it
was impossible to get them over; and I was resolv'd not to break it down:
So I set to Work again; and Friday and I, in about 2 Hours time, made a
very handsom Tent, cover'd with old Sails, and above that with Boughs of
Trees, being in the Space without our outward Fence, and between that and
the Grove of young Wood which I had planted: And here we made them two
Beds of such things as I had (<I>viz</I>.) of good Rice-Straw, with Blankets
laid upon it to lye on, and another to cover them on each Bed. My Island
was now peopled, and I thought my self very rich in Subjects; and it was
a merry Reflection which I frequently made, How like a King I look'd. First
of all, the whole Country was my own meer Property; so that I had an undoubted
Right of Dominion. <I>2dly</I>, My People were perfectly subjected: I was
absolute Lord and Law-giver; they all owed their Lives to me, and were
ready to lay down their Lives, <I>if there had been Occasion of it</I>,
for me. It was remarkable too, we had but three Subjects, and they were
of three different Religions. My Man <I>Friday</I> was a Protestant, his
Father was a <I>Pagan</I> and a <I>Cannibal</I>, and the Spaniard was a
Papist: However, I allow'd Liberty of Conscience throughout my Dominions:
But this is by the Way.

<P>As soon as I had secur'd my two weak rescued Prisoners, and given them
Shelter, and a Place to rest them upon, I began to think of making some
Provision for them: And the first thing I did, I order'd Friday to take
a yearling Goat, betwixt a Kid and a Goat, out of my particular Flock,
to be kill'd, when I cut off the hinder Quarter, and chopping it into small
Pieces, I set Friday to Work to boiling and stewing, and made them a very
good Dish, I assure you, of Flesh and Broth, having put some Barley and
Rice also into the Broth; and as I cook'd it without Doors, for I made
no Fire within my inner Wall, so I carry'd it all into the new Tent; and
having set a Table there for them, I sat down and eat my own Dinner also
with them, and, as well as I could, chear'd them and encourag'd them; <I>Friday
</I>being my Interpreter, especially to his Father, and indeed to the <I>Spaniard</I>
too; for the <I>Spaniard</I> spoke the Language of the <I>Savages</I> pretty
well.

<P>After we had dined, or rather supped, I order'd <I>Friday</I> to take
one of the Canoes, and go and fetch our Muskets and other Fire-Arms, which
for Want of time we had left upon the Place of Battle, and the next Day
I order'd him to go and bury the dead Bodies of the Savages, which lay
open to the Sun, and would presently be offensive; and I also order'd him
to bury the horrid Remains of their barbarous Feast, which I knew were
pretty much, and which I could not think of doing my self; nay, I could
not bear to see them, if I went that Way: All which he punctually performed,
and defaced the very Appearance of the <I>Savages</I> being there; so that
when I went again, I could scarce know where it was, otherwise than by
the Corner of the Wood pointing to the Place.

<P>I then began to enter into a little Conversation with my two new Subjects;
and first I set <I>Friday</I> to enquire of his Father, what he thought
of the Escape of the <I>Savages</I> in that Canoe, and whether we might
expect a Return of them with a Power too great for us to resist: His first
Opinion was, that the Savages in the Boat never could live out the Storm
which blew that Night they went off, but must of Necessity be drowned or
driven <I>South</I> to those other Shores where they were as sure to be
devoured as they were to be drowned if they were cast away; but as to what
they would do if they came safe on Shore, he said he knew not; but it was
his Opinion that they were so dreadfully frighted with the Manner of their
being attack'd, the Noise and the Fire, that he believed they would tell
their People, they were all kill'd by Thunder and Lightning, not by the
Hand of Man, and that the two which appear'd, <I>(viz.</I>) Friday and
me, were two Heavenly Spirits or Furies, come down to destroy them, and
not Men with Weapons: This he said he knew, because he heard them all cry
out so in their Language to one another, for it was impossible to them
to conceive that a Man could dart Fire, and speak Thunder, and kill at
a Distance without lifting up the Hand, as was done now: And this old Savage
was in the right; for, as I understood since by other Hands, the Savages
never attempted to go over to the Island afterwards; they were so terrified
with the Accounts given by those four Men, (for it seems they did escape
the Sea) that they believ'd whoever went to that enchanted Island would
be destroy'd with Fire from the Gods.

<P>This however I knew not, and therefore was under continual Apprehensions
for a good while, and kept always upon my Guard, me and all my Army; for
as we were now four of us, I would have ventur'd upon a hundred of them
fairly in the open Field at any Time.

<P>In a little Time, however, no more Canoes appearing, the Fear of their
Coming wore off, and I began to take my former Thoughts of a Voyage to
the Main into Consideration, being likewise assur'd by <I>Friday's</I>
Father, that I might depend upon good Usage from their Nation on his Account,
if I would go.

<P>But my Thoughts were a little suspended, when I had a serious Discourse
with the <I>Spaniard</I>, and when I understood that there were sixteen
more of his Countrymen and <I>Portuguese</I>, who having been cast away,
and made their Escape to that Side, liv'd there at Peace indeed with the
Savages, but were very sore put to it for Necessaries, and indeed for Life:
I ask'd him all the Particulars of their Voyage, and found they were a
<I>Spanish </I>Ship bound from the <I>Rio de la Plata</I> to the <I>Havana</I>,
being directed to leave their Loading there, which was chiefly Hides and
Silver, and to bring back what <I>European</I> Goods they could meet with
there; that they had five Portuguese Seamen on Board, who they took out
of another Wreck; that five of their own Men were drowned when the first
Ship was lost, and that these escaped thro' infinite Dangers and Hazards,
and arriv'd almost starv'd on the <I>Cannibal</I> Coast, where they expected
to have been devour'd every Moment.

<P>He told me, they had some Arms with them, but they were perfectly useless,
for that they had neither Powder or Ball, the Washing of the Sea having
spoil'd all their Powder but a little, which they used at their first Landing
to provide themselves some Food.

<P>I ask'd him what he thought would become of them there, and if they
had form'd no Design of making any Escape? He said, They had many Consultations
about it, but that having neither Vessel, or Tools to build one, or Provisions
of any kind, their Councils always ended in Tears and Despair.

<P>I ask'd him how he thought they would receive a Proposal from me, which
might tend towards an Escape? And whether, if they were all here, it might
not be done? I told him with Freedom, I fear'd mostly their Treachery and
ill Usage of me, if I put my Life in their Hands; for that Gratitude was
no inherent Virtue in the Nature of Man; nor did Men always square their
Dealings by the Obligations they had receiv'd, So much as they did by the
Advantages they expected. I told him it would be very hard, that I should
be the Instrument of their Deliverance, and that they should afterwards
make me their Prisoner in <I>New Spain</I>, where an <I>English</I> Man
was certain to be made a Sacrifice, what Necessity, or what Accident soever,
brought him thither: And that I had rather be deliver'd up to the <I>Savages</I>,
and be devour'd alive, than fall into the merciless Claws of the Priests,
and be carry'd into the <I>Inquisition</I>. I added, That otherwise I was
perswaded, if they were all here, we might, with so many Hands, build a
Bark large enough to carry us all away, either to the <I>Brasils</I> South-ward,
or to the Islands or <I>Spanish</I> Coast North-ward: But that if in Requital
they should, when I had put Weapons into their Hands, catty me by Force
among their own People, I might be ill used for my Kindness to them, and
make my Case worse than it was before.

<P>He answer'd with a great deal of Candor and Ingenuity, That their Condition
was so miserable, and they were so sensible of it, that he believed they
would abhor the Thought of using any Man unkindly that should contribute
to their Deliverance; and that, if I pleased, he would go to them with
the old Man, and discourse with them about it, and return again, and bring
me their Answer: That he would make Conditions with them upon their solemn
Oath, That they should be absolutely under my Leading, as their Commander
and Captain; and that they should swear upon the Holy Sacraments and the
Gospel, to be true to me, and to go to such Christian Country, as that
I should agree to, and no other; and to be directed wholly and absolutely
by my Orders, 'till they were landed safely in such Country, as I intended;
and that he would bring a Contract from them under their Hands for that
Purpose.

<P>Then he told me, he would first swear to me himself, That he would never
stir from me as long as he liv'd, 'till I gave him Orders; and that he
would take my Side to the last Drop of his Blood, if there should happen
the least Breach of Faith among his Country-men.

<P>He told me, they were all of them very civil honest Men, and they were
under the greatest Distress imaginable, having neither Weapons or Cloaths,
nor any Food, but at the Mercy and Discretion of the <I>Savages;</I> out
of all Hopes of ever returning to their own Country; and that he was sure,
if I would undertake their Relief, they would live and die by me.

<P>Upon these Assurances, I resolv'd to venture to relieve them, if possible,
and to send the old <I>Savage</I> and this Spaniard over to them to treat:
But when we had gotten all things in a Readiness to go, the <I>Spaniard
</I>himself started an Objection, which had so much Prudence in it on one
hand, and so much Sincerity on the other hand, that I could not but be
very well satisfy'd in it; and by his Advice, put off the Deliverance of
his Comerades, for at least half a Year. The Case was thus:

<P>He had been with us now about a Month; during which time, I had let
him see in what Manner I had provided, with the Assistance of Providence,
for my Support; and he saw evidently what Stock of Corn and Rice I had
laid up; which as it was more than sufficient for my self, so it was not
sufficient, at least without good Husbandry, for my Family; now it was
encreas'd to Number four: But much less would it be sufficient, if his
Country-men, who were, as he said, fourteen' still alive, should Come over.
And least of all should it be sufficient to victual our Vessel, if we should
build one, for a Voyage to any of the Christian Colonies of <I>America.</I>
So he told me, he thought it would be more advisable, to let him and the
two other, dig and cultivate some more Land, as much as I could spare Seed
to sow; and that we should wait another Harvest, that we might have a Supply
of Corn for his Country-men when they should come; for Want might be a
Temptation to them to disagree, or not to think themselves delivered, otherwise
than out of one Difficulty into another. You know, says he, the Children
of <I>Israel, </I>though they rejoyc'd at first for their being deliver'd
out of <I>Egypt, </I>yet rebell'd even against God himself that deliver'd
them, when they came to want Bread in the Wilderness.

<P>His Caution was so seasonable, and his Advice so good, that I could
not but be very well pleased with his Proposal, as well as I was satisfy'd
with his Fidelity. So we fell to digging all four of us, as well as the
Wooden Tools we were furnish'd with permitted; and in about a Month's time,
by the End of which it was Seed time, we had gotten as much Land cur'd
and trim'd up, as we sowed 22 Bushels of Barley on, and 16 Jarrs of Rice,
which was in short all the Seed we had to spare; nor indeed did we leave
our selves Barley sufficient for our own Food, for the six Months that
we had to expect our Crop, that is to say, reckoning from the time we set
our Seed aside for sowing; for it is not to be supposed it is six Months
in the Ground in the Country.

<P>Having now Society enough, and our Number being sufficient to put us
out of Fear of the <I>Savages</I>, if they had come, unless their Number
had been very great, we went freely all over the Island, where-ever we
found Occasion; and as here we had our Escape or Deliverance upon our Thoughts,
it was impossible, <I>at least for me</I>, to have the Means of it out
of mine; to this Purpose, I mark'd out several Trees which I thought fit
for our Work, and I set <I>Friday</I> and his Father to cutting them down;
and then I caused the <I>Spaniard,</I> to whom I imparted my Thought on
that Affair, to oversee and direct their Work. I shewed them with what
indefatigable Pains I had hewed a large Tree into single Planks, and I
caused them to do the like, till they had made about a Dozen large Planks
of good Oak, near 2 Foot road, 35 Foot long, and from 2 Inches to 4 Inches
thick: hat prodigious Labour it took up, any one may imagine. At the same
time I contriv'd to encrease my little Flock of tame Goats as much as I
could; and to this Purpose, I made <I>Friday</I> and the <I>Spaniard</I>
go out one Day, and my self with <I>Friday</I> the next Day; for we took
our Turns: And by is Means we got above 20 young Kids to breed up with
the rest; for when-ever we shot the Dam, we saved the Kids, and added them
to our Flock: But above all, the Season for curing the Grapes coming on,
I caused such a prodigious Quantity to be hung up in the Sun, that I believe,
had we been at <I>Alicant</I> where the Raisins of the Sun are cur'd, we
could have fill'd 60 or 80 Barrels; and these with our Bread was a great
Part of our Food, and very good living too, I assure you; for it is an
exceeding nourishing Food.

<P>It was now Harvest, and our Crop in good Order; it was not the most
plentiful Encrease I had seen in the Island, but however it was enough
to answer our End; for from our 22 Bushels of Barley, we brought in and
thrashed out above 220 Bushels; and the like in Proportion of the Rice,
which was Store enough for our Food to the next Harvest, tho' all the 16
<I>Spaniards</I> had been on Shore with me; or if we had been ready for
a Voyage, it would very plentifully have victualled our Ship, to have carry'd
us to any Part of the World, that is to say, of <I>America.</I>

<P>When we had thus hous'd and secur'd our Magazine of Corn, we fell to
Work to make more Wicker Work, (viz.) great Baskets in which we kept it;
and the <I>Spaniard was</I> very handy and dexterous at this Part, and
often blam'd me that I did not make some things, for Defence, of this Kind
of Work; but I saw no Need of it.

<P>And now having a full Supply of Food for all the Guests I expected,
I gave the <I>Spaniard</I> Leave to go over to the <I>Main</I>, to see
what he could do with those he had left behind him there. I gave him a
strict Charge in Writing, Not to bring any Man with him, who would not
first swear in the Presence of himself and of the old <I>Savage</I>, That
he would no way injure, fight with, or attack the Person he should find
in the Island, who was so kind to send for them in order to their Deliverance;
but that they would stand by and defend him against all such Attempts,
and wherever they went, would be entirely under and subjected to his Commands;
and that this should be put in Writing, and signed with their Hands: How
we were to have this done, when I knew they had neither Pen or Ink; that
indeed was a Question which we never asked.

<P>Under these Instructions, the <I>Spaniard</I>, and the old <I>Savage</I>
the Father of <I>Friday</I>, went away in one of the Canoes, which they
might be said to come in, or rather were brought in, when they came as
Prisoners to be devour'd by the <I>Savages.</I>

<P>I gave each of them a Musket with a Firelock on it, and about eight
Charges of Powder and Ball, charging them to be very good Husbands of both,
and not to use either of them but upon urgent Occasion.

<P>This was a chearful Work, being the first Measures used by me in View
of my Deliverance for now 27 Years and some Days. I gave them Provisions
of Bread, and of dry'd Grapes, sufficient for themselves for many Days,
and sufficient for all their Country-men for about eight Days time; and
wishing them a good Voyage, I see them go, agreeing with them about a Signal
they should hang out at their Return, by which I should know them again,
when they came back, at a Distance, before they came on Shore.

<P>They went away with a fair Gale on the Day that the Moon was at Full
by my Account, in the Month of <I>October:</I> But as for an exact Reckoning
of Days, after I had once lost it I could never recover it again; nor had
I kept even the Number of Years so punctually, as to be sure that I was
right, tho' as it prov'd, when I afterwards examin'd my Account, I found
I had kept a true Reckoning of Years.

<P>It was no less than eight Days I had waited for them, when a Strange
and unforeseen Accident interveen'd, of which the like has not perhaps
been heard of in History: I was fast asleep in my Hutch one Morning, when
my Man <I>Friday</I> came running in to me, and call'd aloud, Master, Master,
they are come, they are come.

<P>I jump'd up, and regardless of Danger, I went out, as soon as I could
get my Cloaths on, thro' my little Grove, which by the Way was by this
time grown to be a very thick Wood; I say, regardless of Danger, I went
without my Arms, which was not my Custom to do: But I was surpriz'd, when
turning my Eyes to the Sea, I presently saw a Boat at about a League and
half's Distance, standing in for the Shore, with a <I>Shoulder of Mutton
Sail, </I>as they call it; and the Wind blowing pretty fair to bring them
in; also I observ'd presently, that they did not come from that Side which
the Shore lay on, but from the Southermost End of the Island: Upon this
I call'd <I>Friday</I> in, and bid him lie close, for these were not the
People we look'd for, and that we might not know yet whether they were
Friends or Enemies.

<P>In the next Place, I went in to fetch my Perspective Glass, to see what
I could make of them; and having taken the Ladder out, I climb'd up to
the Top of the Hill, as I used to do when I was apprehensive of any thing,
and to take my View the plainer without being discover'd.

<P>I had scarce Set my Foot on the Hill, when my Eye plainly discover'd
a Ship lying at an Anchor, at about two Leagues and an half's Distance
from me South-south-east, but not above a League and an half from the Shore.
By my Observation it appear'd plainly to be an <I>English</I> Ship, and
the Boat appear'd to be an <I>English</I> Long-Boat.

<P>I cannot express the Confusion I was in, tho' the Joy of seeing a Ship,
and one who I had Reason to believe was Mann'd by my own Country-men, and
consequently Friends, was such as I cannot describe; but yet I had some
secret Doubts hung about me, I cannot tell from whence they came, bidding
me keep upon my Guard. In the first Place, it occurr'd to me to consider
what Business an <I>English</I> Ship could have in that Part of the World,
since it was not the Way to or from any Part of the World, where the <I>English
</I>had any Traffick; and I knew there had been no Storms to drive them
in there, as in Distress; and that if they were <I>English</I> really,
it was most probable that they were here upon no good Design; and that
I had better continue as I was, than fall into the Hands of Thieves and
Murtherers.

<P>Let no Man despise the secret Hints and Notices of Danger, which sometimes
are given him, when he may think there is no Possibility of its being real.
That such Hints and Notices are given us, I believe few that have made
any Observations of things, can deny; that they are certain Discoveries'
of an invisible World, and a Converse of Spirits, we cannot doubt; and
if the Tendency of them seems to be to warn us of Danger, why should we
not suppose they are from some friendly Agent, whether supreme, or inferior,
and subordinate, is not the Question; and that they are given for our Good?

<P>The present Question abundantly confirms me in the Justice of this Reasoning;
for had I not been made cautious by this secret Admonition, come it from
whence it will, I had been undone inevitably, and in a far worse Condition
than before, as you will see presently.

<P>I had not kept my self long in this Posture, but I saw the Boat draw
near the Shore, as if they look'd for a Creek to thrust in at for the Convenience
of Landing; however, as they did not come quite far enough, they did not
see the little Inlet where I formerly landed my Rafts; but run their Boat
on Shore upon the Beach, at about half a Mile from me, which was very happy
for me; for otherwise they would have landed just as I may say at my Door,
and would soon have beaten me out of my Castle, and perhaps have plunder'd
me of all I had.

<P>When they were on Shore, I was fully satisfy'd that they were <I>English
</I>Men; at least, most of them; one or two I thought were <I>Dutch;</I>
but it did not prove so: There were in all eleven Men, whereof three of
them I found were unarm'd, and as I thought, bound; and when the first
four or five of them were jump'd on Shore, they took those three out of
the Boat as Prisoners: One of the three I could perceive using the most
passionate Gestures of Entreaty, Affliction and Despair, even to a kind
of Extravagance; the other two I could perceive lifted up their Hands sometimes,
and appear'd concern'd indeed, but not to such a Degree as the first.

<P>I was perfectly confounded at the Sight, and knew not what the Meaning
of it should be. <I>Friday</I> call'd out to me in <I>English, as</I> well
as he could, O Master! You <I>see</I> English <I>Mans eat Prisoner as well
as </I>Savage <I>Mans</I>. Why, says I, <I>Friday</I>, Do <I>you think
they are a </I>going <I>to eat them then? Yes</I>, says Friday, <I>They
mill eat them: No, no</I>, says I, Friday, <I>I am afraid they mill murther
them indeed, but you may be sure they will not eat them.</I>

<P>All this while I had no thought of what the Matter really was; but Stood
trembling with the Horror of the Sight, expecting every Moment when the
three Prisoners should be kill'd; nay, Once I saw one of the Villains lift
up his Arm with a great Cutlash, as the Seamen call it, or Sword, to spike
one of the poor Men; and I expected to see him fall every Moment, at which
all the Blood in my Body seem'd to run chill in my Veins.

<P>I wish'd heartily now for my <I>Spaniard</I>, and the <I>Savage</I>
that was gone with him; or that I had any way to have come undiscover'd
within shot of them, that I might have rescu'd the three Men; for I saw
no Fire Arms they had among them; but it fell out to my Mind another way.

<P>After I had Observ'd the outragious Usage of the three Men, by the insolent
Seamen, I observ'd the Fellows run scattering about the Land, as if they
wanted to see the Country: I observ'd that the three other Men had Liberty
to go also where they pleas'd; but they Sat down all three upon the Ground,
very pensive, and look'd like Men in Despair.

<P>This put me in Mind of the first Time when I came on Shore, and began
to look about me; How I gave my self over for lost: How wildly I look'd
round me: What dreadful Apprehensions I had: And how I lodg'd in the Tree
all Night for fear of being devour'd by wild Beasts.

<P>As I knew nothing that Night of the Supply I was to receive by the providential
Driving of the Ship nearer the Land, by the Storms and Tide, by which I
have since been so long nourish'd and Supported; so these three poor desolate
Men knew nothing how certain of Deliverance and Supply they were, how near
it was to them, and how effectually and really they were in a Condition
of Safety, at the same Time that they thought themselves lost, and their
Case desperate.

<P>So little do we see before us in the World, and so much reason have
we to depend chearfully upon the great Maker of the World, that he does
not leave his Creatures so absolutely destitute, but that in the worst
Circumstances they have always something to be thankful for, and sometimes
are nearer their Deliverance than they imagine; nay, are even brought to
their Deliverance by the Means by which they seem to be brought to their
Destruction.

<P>It was just at the Top of High-Water when these People came on Shore,
and while partly they stood parlying with the Prisoners they brought, and
partly while they rambled about to see what kind of a Place they were in;
they had carelessly staid till the Tide was spent, and the Water was ebb'd
considerably away, leaving their Boat a-ground.

<P>They had left two Men in the Boat, who as I found afterwards, having
drank a little too much Brandy, fell a-sleep; however, one of them waking
Sooner than the other, and finding the Boat too fast a-ground for him to
stir it, hollow'd for the rest who were straggling about, upon which they
all Soon came to the Boat; but it was past all their Strength to launch
her, the Boat being very heavy, and the Shore on that Side being a soft
ousy Sand, almost like a Quick-Sand.

<P>In this Condition, like true Seamen who are perhaps the and least of
all Mankind given to lore-thought, they gave it over, and away they stroll'd
about the Country again; and I heard one of them say aloud to another,
calling them off from the Boat, Why <I>let her alone</I>, Jack, <I>can't
ye, she will float next Tide;</I> by which I was fully confirm'd in the
main Enquiry, of what Countrymen they were.

<P>All this while I kept my self very close, not once daring to stir out
of my Castle, any farther than to my Place of Observation, near the Top
of the Hill; and very glad I was, to think how well it was fortify'd: I
knew it was no less than ten Hours before the Boat could be on float again,
and by that Time it would be dark, and I might be at more Liberty to see
their Motions, and to hear their Discourse, if they had any.

<P>In the mean Time, I fitted my self up for a Battle, as before; though
with more Caution, knowing I had to do with another kind of Enemy than
I had at first: I order'd <I>Friday</I> also, who I had made an excellent
Marks-Man with his Gun, to load himself with Arms: I took my self two Fowling-Pieces,
and I gave him three Muskets; my Figure indeed was very fierce; I had my
formidable Goat-Skin Coat on, with the great Cap I have mention'd, a naked
Sword by my Side, two Pistols in my Belt, and a Gun upon each Shoulder.

<P>It was my Design, as I said above, not to have made any Attempt till
it was Dark: But about Two a Clock, being the Heat of the Day, I found
that in short they were all gone straggling into the Woods, and as I thought
were laid down to Sleep. The three poor distressed Men, too Anxious for
their Condition to get any Sleep, were however set down under the Shelter
of a great Tree, at about a quarter of a Mile from me, and as I thought
out of sight of any of the rest.

<P>Upon this I resolv'd to discover my self to them, and learn something
of their Condition: Immediately I march'd in the Figure as above, my Man
<I>Friday</I> at a good Distance behind me, as formidable for his Arms
as I, but not making quite so staring a <I>Spectre-like</I> Figure as I
did.

<P>I came as near them undiscover'd as I could, and then before any of
them saw me, I call'd aloud to them in <I>Spanish, What are ye Gentlemen?</I>

<P>They started up at the Noise, but were ten times more confounded when
they saw me, and the uncouth Figure that I made. They made no Answer at
all, but I thought I perceiv'd them just going to fly from me, when I spoke
to them in <I>English</I>, Gentlemen, said I, do not be surpriz'd at me;
perhaps you may have a Friend near you when you did not expect it. He must
be sent directly from Heaven then, <I>said one of them very gravely to
me, and pulling off his Hat at the same time to me</I>, for our Condition
is past the Help of Man. All Help is from Heaven, <I>Sir, said I</I>. But
can you put a Stranger in the way how to help you, for you seem to me to
be in some great Distress? I saw you when you landed, and when you Seem'd
to make Applications to the Brutes that came with you, I saw one of them
lift up his Sword to kill you.

<P>The poor Man with Tears running down his Face, and trembling, looking
like one astonish'd, return'd, <I>Am I talking to God, or Man! Is it a
real Man, or an Angel!</I> Be in no fear about that, Sir, <I>said I</I>,
if God had sent an Angel to relieve you, he would have come better Cloath'd,
and Arm'd after another manner than you see me in; pray lay aside your
Fears, I am a Man, an <I>English-man</I>, and dispos'd to assist you, you
see; I have one Servant only; we have Arms and Ammunition; tell us freely,
Can we serve you ? - What is your Case?

<P>Our Case, said he, Sir, is too long to tell you, while our Murtherers
are so near; but in Short, Sir, I was Commander of that Ship, my Men have
Mutinied against me; they have been hardly prevail'd on not to Murther
me, and at last have set me on Shore in this desolate Place, with these
two Men with me; one my Mate, the other a Passenger, where we expected
to Perish, believing the Place to be uninhabited, and know not yet what
to think of it.

<P>Where are those Brutes, your Enemies, said I, do you know where they
are gone? <I>There they lye</I>, Sir, Said he, pointing to a Thicket of
Trees; my <I>Heart trembles, for fear they have seen us, and heard you
speak, if they have, they will certainly Murther us all.</I>

<P>Have they any Fire-Arms, <I>said I</I>, He answered they had only two
Pieces, and one which they left in the Boat. Well then, Said I, leave the
rest to me; I see they are all asleep, it is an easie thing to kill them
all; but shall we rather take them Prisoners? He told me there were two
desperate Villains among them, that it was scarce safe to shew any Mercy
to; but if they were secur'd, he believ'd all the rest would return to
their Duty. I ask'd him, which they were? He told me he could not at that
distance describe them; but he would obey my Orders in any thing I would
direct. Well, says I, let us retreat out of their View or Hearing, least
they awake, and we will resolve further; so they willingly went back with
me, till the Woods cover'd us from them.

<P>Look you, Sir, said I, if I venture upon your Deliverance, are you willing
to make two Conditions with me? he anticipated my Proposals, by telling
me, that both he and the Ship, if recover'd, should be wholly Directed
and Commanded by me in every thing; and if the Ship was not recover'd,
he would live and dye with me in what Part of the World soever I would
send him; and the two other Men said the same.

<P><I>Well</I>, says I, my <I>Conditions are but two. 1</I>. That while
you stay on this Island with me, you will not pretend to any Authority
here; and if I put Arms into your Hands, you will upon all Occasions give
them up to me, and do no Prejudice to me or mine, upon this Island, and
in the mean time be govern'd by my Orders.

<P>2. That if the Ship is, or may be recover'd, you will carry me and my
Man to <I>England</I> Passage free.

<P>He gave me all the Assurances that the Invention and Faith of Man could
devise, that he would comply with these most reasonable Demands, and besides
would owe his Life to me, and acknowledge it upon all Occasions as long
as he liv'd.

<P>Well then, <I>said I</I>, here are three Muskets for you, with Powder
and Ball; tell me next what you think is proper to be done. He shew'd all
the Testimony of his Gratitude that he was able; but offer'd to be wholly
guided by me. I told him I thought it was hard venturing any thing; but
the best Method I could think of was to fire upon them at once, as they
lay; and if any was not kill'd at the first Volley, and offered to submit,
we might save them, and so put it wholly upon God's Providence to direct
the Shot.

<P>He said very modestly, that he was loath to kill them, if he could help
it, but that those two were incorrigible Villains, and had been the Authors
of all the Mutiny in the Ship, and if they escaped, we should be undone
still; for they would go on Board, and bring the whole Ship's Company,
and destroy us all. <I>Well then</I>, says I, <I>Necessity</I> legitimates
my Advice; for it is the only Way to save our Lives. However, seeing him
still cautious of shedding Blood, I told him they should go themselves,
and manage as they found convenient.

<P>In the Middle of this Discourse, we heard some of them awake, and soon
after, we saw two of them on their Feet, I ask'd him, if either of them
were of the Men who he had said were the Heads of the Mutiny? He said,
<I>No: </I>Well then, said I, you may let them escape, and Providence seems
to have wakned them on Purpose to save themselves. Now, says I, if the
rest escape you, <I>it is your Fault.</I>

<P>Animated with this, he took the Musket, I had given him, in his Hand,
and a Pistol in his Belt, and his two Comerades with him, with each Man
a Piece in his Hand. The two Men who were with him, going first, made some
Noise, at which one of the Seamen who was awake, turn'd about, and seeing
them coming, cry'd out to the rest; but it was too late then; for the Moment
he cry'd out, they fir'd; I <I>mean the two Men</I>, the Captain wisely
reserving his own Piece: They had so well aim'd their Shot at the Men they
knew, that one of them was kill'd on the Spot, and the other very much
wounded; but not being dead, he started up upon his Feet, and call'd eagerly
for help to the other; but the Captain stepping to him, told him, 'twas
too late to cry for help, he should call upon God to forgive his Villany,
and with that Word knock'd him down with the Stock of his Musket, so that
he never spoke more: There were three more in the Company, and one of them
was also slightly wounded: By this Time I was come, and when they saw their
Danger, and that it was in vain to resist, they begg'd for Mercy: The Captain
told them, he would spare their Lives, if they would give him any Assurance
of their Abhorrence of the Treachery they had been guilty of, and would
swear to be faithful to him in recovering the Ship, and afterwards in carrying
her back to <I>Jamaica</I>, from whence they came: They gave him all the
Protestations of their Sincerity that could be desir'd, and he was willing
to believe them, and spare their Lives, which I was not against, only that
I oblig'd him to keep them bound Hand and Foot while they were upon the
Island.

<P>While this was doing, I sent <I>Friday</I> with the Captain's Mate to
the Boat, with Orders to secure her, and bring away the Oars, and Sail,
which they did; and by and by, three straggling Men that were (happily
for them) parted from the rest, came back upon hearing the Guns fir'd,
and seeing their Captain, who before was their Prisoner, now their Conqueror,
they submitted to be bound also; and so our Victory was compleat.

<P>It now remain'd, that the Captain and I should enquire into one another's
Circumstances: I began first, and told him my whole History, which he heard
with an Attention even to Amazement; and particularly, at the wonderful
Manner of my being furnish'd with Provisions and Ammunition; and indeed,
as my Story is a whole Collection of Wonders, it affected him deeply; but
when he reflected from thence upon himself, and how I seem'd to have been
preserv'd there, on purpose to save his Life, the Tears ran down his Face,
and he could not speak a Word more.

<P>After this Communication was at an End, I carry'd him and his two Men
into my Apartment, leading them in, just where I came out, viz. At the
Top of the House, where I refresh'd them with such Provisions as I had,
and shew'd them all the Contrivances I had made, during my long, long,
inhabiting that Place.

<P>All I shew'd them, all I Said to them, was perfectly amazing; but above
all, the Captain admir'd my Fortification, and how perfectly I had conceal'd
my Retreat with a Grove of Trees, which having been now planted near twenty
Years, and the Trees growing much faster than in <I>England</I>, was become
a little Wood, and so thick, that it was unpassable in any Part of it,
but at that one Side, where I had reserv'd my little winding Passage into
it: I told him, this was my Castle, and my Residence; but that I had a
Seat in the Country, as most Princes have, whither I could retreat upon
Occasion, and I would shew him that too another Time; but at present, our
Business was to consider how to recover the Ship: He agreed with me as
to that; but told me, he was perfectly at a Loss what Measures to take;
for that there were still six and twenty Hands on board, who having entred
into a cursed Conspiracy, by which they had all forfeited their Lives to
the Law, would be harden'd in it now by Desperation; and would carry it
on, knowing that if they were reduc'd, they should be brought to the Gallows,
as soon as they came to <I>England</I>, or to any of the <I>English</I>
Colonies; and that therefore there would be no attacking them, with so
small a Number as we were.

<P>I mus'd for some Time upon what he had said; and found it was a very
rational Conclusion; and that therefore something was to be resolv'd on
very speedily, as well to draw the Men on board into some Snare for their
Surprize, as to prevent their Landing upon us, and destroying us; upon
this it presently occurr'd to me, that in a little while the Ship's Crew
wondring what was become of their Comrades, and of the Boat, would certainly
come on Shore in their other Boat, to see for them, and that then perhaps
they might come arm'd, and be too strong for us; this he allow'd was rational.

<P>Upon this, I told him the first Thing we had to do, was to stave the
Boat, which lay upon the Beach, so that they might not carry her off; and
taking every Thing out of her, leave her so far useless as not to be fit
to swim; accordingly we went on board, took the Arms which were left on
board, out of her, and whatever else we found there, which was a Bottle
of Brandy, and another of Rum, a few Bisket Cakes, a Horn of Powder, and
a great Lump of Sugar, in a Piece of Canvas; the Sugar was five or six
Pounds; all which was very welcome to me, especially the Brandy, and Sugar,
of which I had had none left for many Years.

<P>When we had carry'd all these Things on Shore (the Oars, Mast, Sail,
and Rudder of the Boat, were carry'd away before, as above) we knock'd
a great Hole in her Bottom, that if they had come strong enough to master
us, yet they could not carry off the Boat.

<P>Indeed, it was not much in my Thoughts, that we could be able to recover
the Ship; but my View was that if they went away without the Boat, I did
not much question to make her fit again, to carry us away to the <I>Leeward
</I>Islands, and call upon our Friends, the <I>Spaniards</I>, in my Way,
for I had them still in my Thoughts.

<P>While we were thus preparing our Designs, and had first, by main Strength
heav'd the Boat up upon the Beach, so high that the Tide would not fleet
her off at High-Water-Mark; and besides, had broke a Hole in her Bottom,
too big to be quickly stopp'd, and were sat down musing what we should
do; we heard the Ship fire a Gun, and saw her make a Waft with her Antient,
as a Signal for the Boat to come on board; but no Boat stirr'd; and they
fir'd several Times, making other Signals for the Boat.

<P>At last, when all their Signals and Firings prov'd fruitless, and they
found the Boat did not stir, we saw them by the Help of my Glasses, hoist
another Boat out, and row towards the Shore; and we found as they approach'd,
that there was no less than ten Men in her, and that they had Fire-Arms
with them.

<P>As the Ship lay almost two Leagues from the Shore, we had a full View
of them as they came, and a plain Sight of the Men even of their Faces,
because the Tide having set them a little to the <I>East</I> of the other
Boat, they row'd up under Shore, to come to the same Place, where the other
had landed, and where the Boat lay.

<P>By this Means, I say, we had a full View of them, and the Captain knew
the Persons and Characters of all the Men in the Boat, of whom he said,
that there were three very honest Fellows, who he was sure were led into
this Conspiracy by the rest, being over-power'd and frighted.

<P>But that as for the Boatswain, who it seems was the chief Officer among
them, and all the rest, they were as outragious as any of the Ship's Crew,
and were no doubt made desperate in their new Enterprize, and terribly
apprehensive he was, that they would be too powerful for us.

<P>I smil'd at him, and told him, that Men in our Circumstances were past
the Operation of Fear: That seeing almost every Condition that could be,
was better than that which we were suppos'd to be in, we ought to expect
that the Consequence, whether Death or Life, would be sure to be a Deliverance:
I ask'd him, What he thought of the Circumstances of my Life? And, Whether
a Deliverance were not worth venturing for? And where, Sir, said I, is
your Belief of my being preserv'd here on purpose to save your Life, which
elevated you a little while ago? For my Part, said I, there seems to be
but one Thing amiss in all the Prospect of it; <I>What's that?</I> Says
he; why, said I, 'Tis, that as you say, there are three or four honest
Fellows among them, which should be spar'd; had they been all of the wicked
Part of the Crew, I should have thought God's Providence had singled them
out to deliver them into your Hands; for depend upon it, every Man of them
that comes a-shore are our own, and shall die, or live, as they behave
to us.

<P>As I spoke this with a rais'd Voice and chearful Countenance, I found
it greatly encourag'd him; so we set vigorously to our Business: We had
upon the first Appearance of the Boat's coming from the Ship, consider'd
of separating our Prisoners, and had indeed secur'd them effectually.

<P>Two of them, of whom the Captain was less assur'd than ordinary, I sent
with <I>Friday</I>, and one of the three (deliver'd Men) to my Cave, where
they were remote enough, and out of Danger of being heard or discover'd,
or of finding their way out of the Woods, if they could have deliver'd
themselves: Here they left them bound, but gave them Provisions, They promis'd
them if they continu'd there quietly, to give them their Liberty in a Day
or two; but that if they attempted their Escape, they should be put to
Death without Mercy: They promis'd faithfully to bear their Confinement
with Patience, and were very thankful that they had such good Usage, as
to have Provisions, and a Light left them; for <I>Friday</I> gave them
Candles (such as we made our selves) for their Comfort; and they did not
know but that he stood Sentinel over them at the Entrance.

<P>The other Prisoners had better Usage; two of them were kept pinion'd
indeed, because the Captain was not free to trust them; but the other two
were taken into my Service upon their Captain's Recommendation, and upon
their solemnly engaging to live and die with us; so with them and the three
honest Men, we were seven Men, well arm'd; and I made no doubt we shou'd
be able to deal well enough with the Ten that were a coming, considering
that the Captain had said, there were three or four honest Men among them
also.

<P>As soon as they got to the Place where their other Boat lay, they run
their Boat in to the Beach, and came all on Shore, haling the Boat up after
them, which I was glad to see; for I was afraid they would rather have
left the Boat at an Anchor, some Distance from the Shore, with some Hands
in her, to guard her; and so we should not be able to seize the Boat.

<P>Being on Shore, the first Thing they did, they ran all to their other
Boat, and it was easy to see that they were under a great Surprize, to
find her stripp'd as above, of all that was in her, and a great hole in
her Bottom.

<P>After they had mus'd a while upon this, they set up two or three great
Shouts, hollowing with all their might, to try if they could make their
Companions hear; but all was to no purpose: Then they came all close in
a Ring, and fir'd a Volley of their small Arms, which indeed we heard,
and the Ecchos made the Woods ring; but it was all One, those in the Cave
we were sure could not hear, and those in our keeping, though they heard
it well enough, yet durst give no Answer to them.

<P>They were so astonish'd at the Surprize of this, that as they told us
afterwards, they resolv'd to go all on board again to their Ship, and let
them know, that the Men were all murther'd, and the Long-Boat stav'd; accordingly
they immediately launch'd their Boat again, and gat all of them on board.

<P>The Captain was terribly amaz'd, and even confounded at this, believing
they would go on board the Ship again, and set Sail, giving their Comrades
for lost, and so he should still lose the Ship, which he was in Hopes we
should have recover'd; but he was quickly as much frighted the other way.

<P>They had not been long put off with the Boat, but we perceiv'd them
all coming on Shore again; but with this new Measure in their Conduct,
which it seems they consulted together upon, <I>viz</I>. To leave three
Men in the Boat, and the rest to go on Shore, and go up into the Country
to look for their Fellows.

<P>This was a great Disappointment to us; for now we were at a Loss what
to do; for our Seizing those Seven Men on Shore would be no Advantage to
us, if we let the Boat escape; because they would then row away to the
Ship, and then the rest of them would be sure to weigh and set Sail, and
so our recovering the Ship would be lost.

<P>However, we had no Remedy, but to wait and see what the Issue of Things
might present; the seven Men came on Shore, and the three who remain'd
in the Boat, put her off to a good Distance from the Shore, and came to
an Anchor to wait for them; so that it was impossible for us to come at
them in the Boat.

<P>Those that came on Shore, kept close together, marching towards the
Top of the little Hill, under which my Habitation lay; and we could see
them plainly, though they could not perceive us: We could have been very
glad they would have come nearer to us, so that we might have fir'd at
them, or that they would have gone farther off, that we might have come
abroad.

<P>But when they were come to the Brow of the Hill, where they could see
a great way into the Valleys and Woods, which lay towards the <I>North-East
</I>Part, and where the Island lay lowest, they shouted, and hollow'd,
till they were weary; and not caring it seems to venture far from the Shore,
nor far from one another, they sat down together under a Tree, to consider
of it: Had they thought fit to have gone to sleep there, as the other Party
of them had done, they had done the Jobb for us; but they were too full
of Apprehensions of Danger, to venture to go to sleep, though they could
not tell what the Danger was they had to fear neither.

<P>The Captain made a very just Proposal to me, upon this Consultation
of theirs, viz. That perhaps they would all fire a Volley again, to endeavour
to make their Fellows hear, and that we should all Sally upon them, just
at the Juncture when their Pieces were all discharg'd, and they would certainly
yield, and we should have them without Bloodshed: I lik'd the Proposal,
provided it was done while we heard, when they were presently stopp'd by
the Creek, where the Water being up, they could not get over, and call'd
for the Boat to come up, and Set them over, as indeed I expected.

<P>When they had Set themselves over, I observ'd, that the Boat being gone
up a good way into the Creek, and as it were, in a Harbour within the Land,
they took one of the three Men out of her to go along with them, and left
only two in the Boat, having fastned her to the Stump of a little Tree
on the Shore.

<P>This was what I wish'd for, and immediately leaving <I>Friday</I> and
the Captain's Mate to their Business, I took the rest with me, and crossing
the Creek out of their Sight, we surpriz'd the two Men before they were
aware; one of them lying on Shore, and the other being in the Boat; the
Fellow on Shore, was between sleeping and waking, and going to start up,
the Captain who was foremost, ran in upon him, and knock'd him down, and
then call'd out to him in the Boat, to yield, or he was a dead Man.

<P>There needed very few Arguments to perswade a single Man to yield, when
he Saw five Men upon him, and his Comrade knock'd down; besides, this was
it seems one of the three who were not so hearty in the Mutiny as the rest
of the Crew, and therefore was easily perswaded, not only to yield, but
afterwards to joyn very sincere with us.

<P>In the mean time, <I>Friday</I> and the Captain's Mate so well manag'd
their Business with the rest, that they drew them by hollowing and answering,
from one Hill to another, and from one Wood to another, till they not only
heartily tyr'd them but left them, where they were very Sure they could
not reach back to the Boat, before it was dark; and indeed they were heartily
tyr'd themselves also by the Time they came back to us.

<P>We had nothing now to do, but to watch for them, in the Dark, and to
fall upon them, so as to make sure work with them.

<P>It was several Hours after <I>Friday</I> came back to me, before they
came back to their Boat; and we could hear the foremost of them long before
they came quite up, calling to those behind to come along, and could also
hear them answer and complain, how lame and tyr'd they were, and not able
to -come any faster, which was very welcome News to us.

<P>At length they came up to the Boat; but 'tis impossible to express their
Confusion, when they found the Boat fast a-Ground in the Creek, the Tide
ebb'd out, and their two Men gone We could hear them call to one another
in a most lamentable Manner, telling one another, they were gotten into
an inchanted Island; that either there were Inhabitants in it, and they
should all be murther'd, or else there were Devils and Spirits in it, and
they should be all carry'd away, and devour'd.

<P>They hallow'd again, and call'd their two Comerades by their Names,
a great many times, but no Answer. After some time, we could see them,
by the little Light there was, run about wringing their Hands like Men
in Despair; and that sometimes they would go and sit down in the Boat to
rest themselves, then come ashore again, and walk about again, and so over
the same thing again.

<P>My Men would fain have me given them Leave to fall upon them at once
in the Dark; but I was willing to take them at some Advantage, so to spare
them, and kill as few of them as I could; and especially I was unwilling
to hazard the killing any of our own Men, knowing the other were very well
armed. I resolved to wait to see if they did not separate; and therefore
to make sure of them, I drew my Ambuscade nearer, and order'd <I>Friday</I>
and the Captain, to creep upon their Hands and Feet as close to the Ground
as they could, that they might not be discover'd, and get as near them
as they could possibly, before they offered to fire.

<P>They had not been long in that Posture, but that the Boatswain, who
was the principal Ringleader of the Mutiny, and had now shewn himself the
most dejected and dispirited of all the rest, came walking towards them
with two more of their Crew; the Captain was so eager, as having this principal
Rogue so much in his Power, that he could hardly have Patience to let him
come so near, as to be sure of him; for they only heard his Tongue before:
But when they came nearer, the Captain and <I>Friday</I> starting up on
their Feet, let fly at them.

<P>The Boatswain was kill'd upon the Spot, the next Man was Shot into the
Body, and fell just by him, tho' he did not die 'till an Hour or two after;
and the third run for it.

<P>At the Noise of the Fire, I immediately advanc'd with my whole Army,
which was now 8 Men, <I>viz</I>. my self <I>Generalissimo, Friday</I> my
Lieutenant-General, the Captain and his two Men, and the three Prisoners
of War, who we had trusted with Arms.

<P>We came upon them indeed in the Dark, so that they could not see our
Number; and I made the Man we had left in the Boat, who was now one of
us, call to them by Name, to try if I could bring them to a Parley, and
so might perhaps reduce them to Terms, which fell out just as we desir'd:
for deed it was easy to think, as their Condition then was, they would
be very willing to capitulate; so he calls out as loud as he could, to
one of them, <I>Tom Smith, Tom Smith; Tom Smith</I> answered immediately,
<I>Who's that, </I>Robinson? for it seems he knew his Voice: T'other answered,
<I>Ay, ay; for God's Sake</I>, Tom Smith, <I>throw down your Arms, and
yield</I>, or, <I>you are all dead Men this Moment.</I>

<P><I>Who must me yield to? where are they?</I> (says <I>Smith</I> again;)
<I>Here they are:</I> says he, here's our Captain, and fifty Men with him,
have been hunting you this two Hours; the Boatswain is kill'd, <I>Will
Frye</I> is wounded, and I am a Prisoner; and if you do not yield, you
are all lost.

<P>Will they give us. Quarter then, (says <I>Tom Smith</I>) and we will
yield? <I>I'll go and ask, if you promise to yield</I>, says <I>Robinson</I>;
So he ass:'d the Captain, and the Captain then calls himself out, You <I>Smith</I>,
you know my Voice, if you lay down your Arms immediately, and submit, you
shall have your Lives all but <I>Will. Atkins</I>.

<P>Upon this, <I>Will Atkins</I> cry'd out, <I>For God's Sake, Captain,
give me Quarter, what have I done? They have been all as bad as I, </I>which
by the Way was not true neither; for it seems this Will. Atkins was the
first Man that laid hold of the Captain, when they first mutiny'd, and
used him barbarously, in tying his Hands, and giving him injurious Language.
However, the Captain told him he must lay down his Arms at Discretion,
and trust to the Governour's Mercy, by which he meant me; for they all
call'd me Governour.

<P>In a Word, they all laid down their Arms, and begg'd their Lives; and
I sent the Man that had parley'd with them, and two more, who bound them
all; and then my great Army of 50 Men, which particularly with those three,
were all but eight, came up and seiz'd upon them all, and upon their Boat,
only that I kept my self and one more out of Sight, for Reasons of State.

<P>Our next Work was to repair the Boat, and think of seizing the Ship;
and as for the Captain, now he had Leisure to parley with them: He expostulated
with them upon the Villany of their Practices with him, and at length upon
the farther Wickedness of their Design, and how certainly it must bring
them to Misery and Distress in the End, and perhaps to the Gallows.

<P>They all appear'd very penitent, and begg'd hard for their Lives; as
for that, he told them, they were none of his Prisoners, but the Commander
of the Island; that they thought they had set him on Shore in a barren
uninhabited Island, but it had pleased God so to direct them, that the
Island was inhabited, and that the Governour was an English Man; that he
might hang them all there, if he pleased; but as he had given them all
Quarter, he supposed he would send them to <I>England</I> to be dealt with
there, as Justice requir'd, except <I>Atkins</I>, who he was commanded
by the Governour to advise to prepare for Death; for that he would be hang'd
in the Morning.

<P>Though this was all a Fiction of his own, yet it had its desired Effect;
<I>Atkins</I> fell upon his Knees to beg the Captain to interceed with
the Governour for his Life; and all the rest beg'd of him for God's Sake,
that they might not be sent to <I>England.</I>

<P>It now occurr'd to me, that the time of our Deliverance was come, and
that it would be a most easy thing to bring these Fellows in, to be hearty
in getting Possession of the Ship; so I retir'd in the Dark from them,
that they might not see what Kind of a Governour they had, and call'd the
Captain to me; when I call'd, as at a good Distance, one of the Men was
order'd to speak again, and say to the Captain, <I>Captain, the Commander
calls for you;</I> and presently the Captain reply'd, <I>Tell his Excellency,
I am just a coming:</I> This more perfectly amused' them; and they all
believed that the Commander was just by with his fifty Men.

<P>Upon the Captain's coming to me, I told him my Project for seizing the
Ship, which he lik'd of wonderfully well, and resolv'd to put it in Execution
the next Morning.

<P>But in Order to execute it with more Art, and secure of Success, I told
him, we must divide the Prisoners, and that he should go and take <I>Atkins
</I>and two more of the worst of them, and send them pinion'd to the Cave
where the others lay: This was committed to <I>Friday</I> and the two Men
who came on Shore with the Captain.

<P>They convey'd them to the Cave, as to a Prison; and it was indeed a
dismal Place, especially to Men in their Condition.

<P>The other I order'd to my <I>Bower, as</I> I call'd <I>it, of</I> which
I have given a full Description; and as it was fenc'd in, and they pinion'd,
the Place was secure enough, considering they were upon their Behaviour.

<P>To these in the Morning I sent the Captain, who was to enter into a
Parley with them, in a Word to try them, and tell me, whether he thought
they might be trusted or no, to on Board and surprize the Ship. He talk'd
to them of the Injury done him, of the Condition they were brought to;
and that though the Governour had given them Quarter for their Lives, as
to the present Action, yet that if they were sent to <I>England</I>, they
would all be hang'd in Chains, to be sure; but that if they would join
in so just an Attempt, as to recover the Ship, he would have the Governour's
Engagement for their Pardon.

<P>Any one may guess how readily such a Proposal would be accepted by Men
in their Condition; they fell down on their Knees to the Captain, and promised
with the deepest Imprecations, that they would be faithful to him to the
last Drop, and that they should owe their Lives to him, and would go with
him all over the World, that they would own him for a Father to them as
long as they liv'd.

<P>Well, says the Captain, I must go and tell the Governour what you say,
and see what I can do to bring him to consent to it: So he brought me an
Account of the Temper he found them in; and that he verily believ'd they
would be faithful.

<P>However, that we might be very secure, I told him he should go back
again, and choose out five of them, and tell them, they might see that
he did not want Men, that he would take out those five to be his Assistants,
and that the Governour would keep the other two, and the three that were
sent Prisoners to the Castle, (<I>my Cave</I>) as Hostages, for the Fidelity
of those five; and that if they prov'd unfaithful in the Execution, the
five Hostages should be hang'd in Chains alive upon the Shore.

<P>This look'd severe, and convinc'd them that the Governour was in Earnest;
however they had no Way left them, but to accept it; and it was now the
Business of the Prisoners, as much as of the Captain, to perswade the other
five to do their Duty.

<P>Our Strength was now thus ordered for the Expedition: 1. The Captain,
his Mate, and Passenger. 2. Then the two Prisoners of the first Gang, to
whom having their Characters from the Captain, I had given their Liberty,
and trusted them with Arms. 3. The other two who I had kept till now, in
my Bower, pinion'd; but upon the Captain's Motion, had now releas'd. These
five releas'd at last: So that they were twelve in all, besides five we
kept Prisoners in the Cave, for Hostages.

<P>I ask'd the Captain, if he was willing to venture with these Hands on
Board the Ship; for as for me and my Man <I>Friday,</I> I did not think
it was proper for us to stir, having seven Men left behind; and it was
Employment enough for us to keep them assunder, and supply them with Victuals.

<P>As to the five in the Cave, I resolv'd to keep them fast, but <I>Friday
</I>went in twice a Day to them, to supply them with Necessaries; and I
made the other two carry Provisions to a certain Distance, where <I>Friday</I>
was to take it.

<P>When I shew'd my self to the two Hostages, it was with the Captain,
who told them, I was the Person the Governour had order'd to look after
them, and that it was the Governour's Pleasure they should not stir any
where, but by my Direction; that if they did, they should be fetch'd into
the Castle, and be lay'd in Irons; so that as we never suffered them to
see me as Governour, so I now appear'd as another Person, and Spoke of
the Governour, the Garrison, the Castle, and the like, upon all Occasions.

<P>The Captain now had no Difficulty before him, but to furnish his two
Boats, Stop the Breach of one, and Man them. He made his Passenger Captain
of one, with four other Men; and himself, and his Mate, and five more,
went in the other: And they contriv'd their Business very well; for they
came up to the Ship about Midnight: As soon as they came within Call of
the Ship, he made <I>Robinson</I> hale them, and tell them they had brought
off the Men and the Boat, but that it was a long time before they had found
them, and the like holding them in a Chat 'till they came to the Ship's
Side when the Captain and the Mate entring first with their Arms, immediately
knock'd down the second Mate and Carpenter, with the But-end of their Muskets,
being very faithfully seconded by their Men, they secur'd all the rest
that were upon the Main and Quarter Decks, and began to fasten the Hatches
to keep them down who were below, when the other Boat and their Men entring
at the fore Chains, secur'd the Fore-Castle of the Ship, and the Scuttle
which went down into the Cook Room, making three Men they found there,
Prisoners.

<P>When this was done, and all safe upon Deck, the Captain order'd the
Mate with three Men to break into the Round-House where the new Rebel Captain
lay, and having taken the Alarm, was gotten up, and with two Men and a
Boy had gotten Fire Arms in their Hands, and when the Mate with a Crow
split open the Door, the new Captain and his Men fir'd boldly among them,
and wounded the Mate with a Musket Ball which broke his Arm, and wounded
two more of the but kill'd no Body.

<P>The Mate calling for Help, rush'd however into the Round-House, wounded
as he was, and with his Pistol shot the new Captain thro' the Head, the
Bullet entring at his Mouth, and came out again behind one of his Ears;
so that he never spoke a Word; upon which the rest yielded, and the Ship
was taken effectually, without any more Lives lost.

<P>As soon as the Ship was thus secur'd, the Captain order'd seven Guns
to be fir'd, which was the Signal agreed upon with me, to give me Notice
of his Success, which you may be sure I was very glad to hear, having sat
watching upon the Shore for it till near two of the Clock in the Morning.
