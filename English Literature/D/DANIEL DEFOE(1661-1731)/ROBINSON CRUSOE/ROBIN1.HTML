The Life And Adventures Of Robinson Crusoe, etc</H1>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>Part 1</FONT></B>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>I was born in the Year 1632, in the City of York, of a good Family,
tho' not of that Country, my Father being a Foreigner of Bremen, who settled
first at <I>Hull</I>: He got a good Estate by Merchandise, and leaving
off his Trade, lived afterward at <I>York</I>, from whence he had married
my Mother, Relations were named <I>Robinson</I>, a very good Family at
Country, and from whom I was called <I>Robinson Keutznaer</I>; but by the
usual Corruption of Words in England, we are now called, nay we call our
Selves, and writer Name Crusoe, and so my Companions always call'd me.

<P>I had two elder Brothers, one of which was Lieutenant Collonel to an
<I>English</I> Regiment of Foot in Flanders, formerly commanded by the
famous Coll. <I>Lockhart</I>, and was killed at the Battle near Dunkirk
against the <I>Spaniards</I>: What became of my second Brother I never
knew any more than Father or Mother did know what was become of me.

<P>Being the third Son of the Family, and not bred to any Trade, my Head
began to be fill'd very early with rambling Thoughts: My Father, who was
very ancient, had given me competent Share of Learning, as far as House-Education,
and a Country Free-School generally goes, and design'd for the Law; but
I would be satisfied with nothing but go to Sea, and my inclination to
this led me so strongly against the Will, nay the Commands of my Father,
and against all the Entreaties and Perswasions of my Mother and other Friends,
that there seem'd to be something fatal in Propension of Nature tending
directly to the Life of Misery which was to befal me.

<P>My Father, a wise and grave Man, gave me serious excellent Counsel against
what he foresaw was my Design. He call'd me one Morning into his Chamber,
where he confined by the Gout, and expostulated very warmly me upon this
Subject: He ask'd me what Reasons more a meer wandring inclination I had
for leaving my Father House and my native Country, where I might be well
introduced, and had a Prospect of raising my Fortunes Application and Industry,
with a Life of Ease and Pleasure He told me it was for Men of desperate
Fortunes on one Hand, or of aspiring, Superior Fortunes on the other, who
went abroad upon Adventures, to rise by Enterprize, and make themselves
famous in Undertakings of a Nature out of the common Road; that these things
were all either too far above me, or too far below me; that mine was the
middle State, or what might be called the upper Station of <I>Low Life</I>,
which he had found by long Experience was the best State in the World,
the most suited to human Happiness, not exposed to the Miseries and Hardships,
the Labour and Sufferings of the mechanick Part of Mankind, and not embarass'd
with the Pride, Luxury, Ambition and Envy of the upper Part of Mankind.
He told me, I might judge of the Happiness of this State, by this one thing,
<I>viz</I>. That this was the State of Life which all other People envied,
that Kings have frequently lamented the miserable Consequences of being
born to great things, and wish'd they had been placed in the Middle of
the two Extremes, between Mean and the Great; that the wise Man gave his
Testimony to this as the just Standard of true Felicity, when he pray to
have neither Poverty or Riches.

<P>He bid me observe it, and I should always find, that the Calamitles
of Life were shared among the upper and lower Part of Mankind; but that
the middle Station had the fewest Disasters, and was not expos'd to so
many Vicisitudes as the higher or lower Part of Mankind; nay, they were
not subjected to so many Distempers and Uneasiness either of Body or Mind,
as those were who, by vicious Living, Luxury and Extravagancies on one
Hand, or by hard Labour, Want of Necessaries, and mean or insufficient
Diet on the other Hand, bring Distempers upon themselves by the natural
Consequences of their Way of Living; <I>That</I> the middle Station of
Life was calculated for, all kind of Vertues and all kinds of Enjoyments;
that Peace and Plenty were the Hand-maids of a middle Fortune; that Temperance,
Moderation, Quietness, Health, Society, all agreeable Diversions, and all
desirable Pleasures, were the Blessings attending the middle Station of
Life; that this Way Men went silently and smoothly thro' the World, and
comfortably out of it, not embarass'd with the Labours of the Hands or
of the Head, not sold to the Life of Slavery for daily Bread, or harrast
with perplex'd Circumstances, which rob the Soul of Peace, and the Body
of Rest; not enrag'd with the Passion of Envy, or secret burning Lust of
Ambition for great things; but in easy Circumstances sliding gently thro'
the World, and sensibly tasting the Sweets of living, without the bitter,
feeling that they are happy, and learning by every Day's Experience to
know it more sensibly.

<P>After this, he press'd me earnestly, and in the most affectionate manner,
not to play the young Man, not to precipitate my self into Miseries which
Nature and the Station of Life I was born in, seem'd to have provided against;
that I was under no Necessity of seeking my Bread; that he would do well
for me, and endeavour to enter me fairly into the Station of Life which
he had been just recommending to me; and that if I was not very easy and
happy in the World, it must be my meer, Fate or Fault that must hinder
it, and that he should have nothing to answer for, having thus discharg'd
his Duty in warning me against Measures which he knew would be to my Hurt:
In a word, that as he would do very kind things for me if I would stay
and settle at Home as he directed, so he would not have so much Hand in
my Misfortunes, as to give me any Encouragement to go away: And to close
all, he told me I had my elder Brother for an Example, to whom he had used
the same earnest Perswasions to keep him from going into the Low Country
Wars, but could not prevail, his young Desires prompting him to run into
the Army where he was kill'd; and tho' he said he would not cease to pray
for me, yet he would venture to say to me, that if I did take this foolish
Step, God would not bless me, and I would have Leisure hereafter to reflect
upon having neglected his Counsel when there might be none to assist in
my Recovery.

<P>I observed in this last Part of his Discourse, which was truly Prophetick,
tho' I suppose my Father did not know it to be so himself; I say, I observed
the Tears run down his Face very plentifully, and especially when he spoke
of my Brother who was kill'd; and that when he spoke of my having Leisure
to repent, and none to assist me, he was so mov'd,0that he broke off the
Discourse, and told me, his Heart was so full he could say no more to me.

<P>I was sincerely affected with this Discourse, as indeed who could be
otherwise? and I resolv'd not to think of going abroad any more, but to
settle at home according to my Father's Desire. But alas! a few Days wore
it all off; and in short, to prevent any of my Father's farther Importunities,
in a few Weeks after, I resolv'd to run quite away from him. However, I
did not act so hastily neither as my first Heat of Resolution prompted,
but I took my Mother, at a time when I thought her a little pleasanter
than ordinary, and told her, that my Thoughts were so entirely bent upon
seeing the World, that I should never settle to any thing with Resolution
enough to go through with it, and my Father had better give me his Consent
than force me to go without it; that I was now Eighteen Years old, which
was too late to go Apprentice to a Trade, or Clerk to an Attorney; that
I was sure if I did, I should never serve out my time, and I should certainly
run away from my Master before my Time was out, and go to Sea; and if she
would speak to my Father to let me go but one Voyage abroad, if I came
home again and did not like it, I would go no more, and I would promise
by a double Diligence to recover that Time I had lost.

<P>This put my Mother into a great Passion: She told me, she knew it would
be to no Purpose to speak to my Father upon any such Subject; that he knew
too well what was my Interest to give his Consent to any thing so much
for my Hurt, and that she wondered how I could think of any such thing
after such a Discourse as I had had with my Father, and such kind and tender
Expressions as she knew my Father had us'd to me; and that in short, if
I would ruine my self there was no Help for me; but I might depend I should
never have their Consent to it: That for her Part she would not have so
much Hand in my Destruction; and I should never have it to say, that my
Mother was willing when my Father was not.

<P>Tho' my Mother refused to move it to my Father, yet as I have heard
afterwards, she reported all the Discourse to him., and that my Father,
after shewing a great Concern at it, said to her with a Sigh, That Boy
might be happy if he would stay at home, but if he goes abroad he will
be the miserablest Wretch that was ever born: I can give no Consent to
it.

<P>It was not till almost a Year after this that I broke loose, tho' in
the mean time I continued obstinately deaf to all Proposals of settling
to Business, and frequently expostulating with my Father and Mother, about
their being so positively determin'd against what they knew my Inclinations
prompted me to. But being one Day at <I>Hull</I>, where I went casually,
and without any Purpose of making an Elopement that time; but I say, being
there, and one of my Companions being going by Sea to London, in his Father's
Ship, and prompting me to go with them, with the common Allurement of Seafaring
Men, <I>viz</I> That it should cost me nothing for my Passage, I consulted
neither Father or Mother any more, nor so much as sent them Word of it;
but leaving them to hear of it as they might, without asking God's Blessing,
or my Father's, without any Consideration of Circumstances or Consequences,
and in an ill Hour, God knows. On the first of <I>September</I> 1651 I
went on Board a Ship bound for <I>London</I>; never any young Adventurer's
Misfortunes, I believe, began sooner, or continued longer than mine. The
Ship was no sooner gotten out of the <I>Humber</I>, but the Wind began
to blow, and the Winds' to rise in a most frightful manner; and as I had
never been at Sea before, I was most inexpressibly sick in Body, and terrify'd
in my Mind: I began now seriously to reflect upon what I had done, and
how justly I was overtaken by the Judgment of Heaven for my wicked leaving
my Father's House, and abandoning my Duty; all the good Counsel of my Parents,
my Father's Tears and my Mother's Entreaties came now fresh into my Mind,
and my Conscience, which was not yet come to the Pitch of Hardness to which
it has been since, reproach'd me with the Contempt of Advice, and the Breach
of my Duty to God and my Father.

<P>All this while the Storm encreas'd, and the Sea, which I had never been
upon before, went very high, tho' nothing like what I have seen many times
since; no, nor like what I saw a few Days after: But it was enough to affect
me then, who was but a young Sailor, and had never known any thing of the
matter. I expected every Wave would have swallowed us up, and that every
time the Ship fell down, as I thought, in the Trough or Hollow of the Sea,
we should never rise more; and in this Agony of Mind, I made many Vows
and Resolutions, that if it would please God here to spare my Life this
one Voyage, if ever I got once my Foot upon dry Land again, I would go
directly home to my Father, and never set it into a Ship again while I
liv'd; that I would take his Advice, and never run my self into such Miseries
as these any more. Now I saw plainly the Goodness of his Observations about
the middle Station of Life, how easy, how comfortably he had liv'd all
his Days, and never had been expos'd to Tempests at Sea, or Troubles on
Shore; and I resolv'd that I would, like a true repenting Prodigal, go
home to my Father.

<P>These wise and sober Thoughts continued all the while the Storm continued,
and indeed some time after; but the next Day the Wind was abated and the
Sea calmer, and I began to be a little inur'd to it: However I was very
grave for all that Day, being also a little Sea sick still; but towards
Night the Weather clear'd up, the Wind was quite over, and a charming fine
Evening follow'd; the Sun went down perfectly clear and rose so the next
Morning; and having little or no Wind and a smooth Sea, the Sun shining
upon it, the Sight was, as I thought, the most delightful that ever I saw.

<P>I had slept well in the Night, and was now no more Sea sick: but very
chearful, looking with Wonder upon the Sea that was so rough and terrible
the Day before, and could be so calm and so pleasant in so little time
after. And now least my good Resolutions should continue, my Companion,
who had indeed entic'd me away, comes to me, <I>Well</I> Bob, says he,
clapping me on the Shoulder, <I>How do you do after it? I warrant you were
frighted, wa'n't you, last Night, when it blew but a Cap full of Wind?
A Cap full d'you call it? said I, 'twas a terrible Storm: A Storm, you
Fool you</I>, replies he, <I>do you call that a Storm, why it was nothing
at all; give us but a good Ship and Sea Room, and we think nothing of such
a Squal of Wind as that; but you're but a fresh Water Sailor</I>, Bob;
<I>come let us make a Bowl of Punch and we'll forget all that, d'ye see
what charming Weather 'tis now</I>. To make short this sad Part of my Story,
we went the old way of all Sailors, the Punch was made, and I was made
drunk with it, and in that one Night's Wickedness I drowned all my Repentance,
all my Reflections upon my past Conduct, and all my Resolutions for my
future. In a word, as the Sea was returned to its Smoothness of Surface
and settled Calmness by the Abatement of that Storm, so the Hurry of my
Thoughts being over, my Fears and Apprehensions of being swallow'd up by
the Sea being forgotten, and the Current of my former Desires return'd,
I entirely forgot the Vows and Promises that I made in my Distress. I found
indeed some Intervals of Reflection, and the serious Thoughts did, as it
were endeavour to return again sometimes, but I shook them off, and rouz'd
my self from them as it were from a Distemper, and applying my self to
Drink and Company, Soon master'd the Return of those Fits, for so I call'd
them, and I had in five or six Days got as compleat a Victory over Conscience
as any young Fellow that resolv'd not to be troubled with it, could desire:
But I was to have another Trial for it still; and Providence, as in such
Cases generally it does, resolv'd to leave me entirely without Excuse.
For if I would not take this for a Deliverance, the next was to be such
a one as the worst and most harden'd Wretch among us would confess both
the Danger and the Mercy.

<P>The sixth Day of our being at Sea we came into <I>Yarmouth</I> Roads;
the Wind having been contrary, and the Weather calm, we had made but little
Way since the Storm. Here we were obliged to come to an Anchor, and here
we lay, the Wind continuing contrary, <I>viz</I>. at South-west, for seven
or eight Days, during which time a great many Ships from <I>Newcastle</I>
came into the same Roads, as the common Harbour where the Ships might wait
for a Wind for the River.

<P>We had not however rid here so long, but should have Tided it up the
River, but that the Wind blew too fresh; and after we had lain four or
five Days, blew very hard. However, the Roads being reckoned as good as
a Harbour, the Anchorage good, and our Ground-Tackle very strong, our Men
were unconcerned, and not in the least apprehensive of Danger, but spent
the Time in Rest and Mirth, after the manner of the Sea; but the eighth
Day in the Morning, the Wind increased, and we had all Hands at Work to
strike our Top-Masts, and make every thing snug and close, that the Ship
might ride as easy as possible. By Noon the Sea went very high indeed,
and our Ship rid <I>Forecastle in</I>, shipp'd several Seas, and we thought
once or twice our Anchor had come home; upon which our Master order'd out
the Sheet Anchor; so that we rode with two Anchors a-Head, and the Cables
vered out to the better End.

<P>By this Time it blew a terrible Storm indeed, and now I began to see
Terror and Amazement in the Faces even of the Seamen themselves. The Master,
tho' vigilant to the Business of preserving the Ship, yet as he went in
and out of his Cabbin by me, I could hear him softly to himself say several
times, <I>Lord be merciful to us, we shall be all lost, we shall be all
undone</I>; and the like. During these first Hurries, I was stupid, lying
still in my Cabbin, which was in the Steerage, and cannot describe my Temper:
I could ill reassume the first Penitence, which I had so apparently trampled
upon, and harden'd my self against: I thought the Bitterness of Death had
been past, and that this would be nothing too like the first. But when
the Master himself came by me as I said just now, and said we should be
all lost, I dreadfully frighted: I got up out of my Cabbin, and look'd
out; but such a dismal Sight I never saw: The Sea went Mountains high,
and broke upon us every three or four Minutes: When I could look about,
I could see nothing but Distress round us: Two Ships that rid near us we
found had cut their Masts by the Board, being deep loaden; and our Men
cry'd out, that a Ship which rid about a Mile a-Head of us was foundered.
Two more Ships being driven from their Anchors, were run out of the Roads
to Sea at all Adventures, and that was not a Mast standing. The light Ships
fared the best; as not so much labouring in the Sea; but two or three of
them drove, and came close by us, running away with only their Sprit-sail
out before the Wind.

<P>Towards Evening the Mate and Boat-Swain begg'd the Master of our Ship
to let them cut away the Foremast, which he was very unwilling to: But
the Boat-Swain protesting to him, that if he did not, the Ship would founder,
he consented; and when they had cut away the Foremast, the Main-Mast stood
so loose, and shook the Ship so much, they were obliged to cut her away
also, and make a clear Deck.

<P>Any one may judge what a Condition I must be in at all his; who was
but a young Sailor, and who had been in such Fright before at but a little.
But if I can express at this Distance the Thoughts I had about me at that
time, I was in tenfold more Horror of Mind upon Account of my former Convictions,
and the having returned from them to the Resolutions I had wickedly taken
at first, than I was at Death it self; and these added to the Terror of
the Storm, put me into such a Condition, that I can by no Words describe
it. But the worst was not come yet, the Storm continued with such Fury,
that the Seamen themselves acknowledged they had never known a worse. We
had a good Ship, but she was deep loaden, and wallowed in the Sea, that
the Seamen every now and then cried out, she would founder. It was my Advantage
in one respect, that I did not know what they meant by Founder, till I
enquir'd. However, the Storm was so violent, that I saw what is not often
seen, the Master, the Boat-Swain, and some others more sensible than the
rest, at their Prayers, and expecting every Moment when the Ship would
go to the Bottom. In the Middle of the Night, and under all the rest of
our Distresses, one of the Men that had been down on Purpose to see, cried
out we had sprung a Leak; another said there was four Foot Water in the
Hold. Then all Hands were called to the Pump. At that very Word my Heart,
as I thought, died within me, and I fell backwards upon the Side of my
Bed where I sat, into the Cabbin. However, the Men roused me, and told
me, that I that was able to do nothing before, was as well able to pump
as another; at which I stirr'd up, and went to the Pump and work'd very
heartily. While this was doing, the Master seeing some light Colliers,
who not able to ride out the Storm, were oblig'd to slip and run away to
Sea, and would come near us, ordered to fire a Gun as a Signal of Distress.
I who knew nothing what that meant, was so surprised, that I thought the
Ship had broke, or some dreadful thing had happen'd. In a word, I was so
surprised, that I fell down in a Swoon. As this was a time when every Body
had his own Life to think of, no body minded me, or what was become of
me; but another Man stept up the Pump, and thrusting me aside with his
Foot, let me lye, thinking I had been dead; and it was a great while before
I came to my self.

<P>We work'd on, but the Water encreasing in the Hold, it was apparent
that the Ship would founder, and tho' the Storm began to abate a little,
yet as it was not possible she could swim till we might run into a Port,
so the Master continued firing Guns for Help; and a light Ship who had
rid it out just a Head of us ventured a Boat out to help us. It was with
the utmost Hazard the Boat came near us, but it was impossible for us to
get on Board, or for the Boat to lie near the Ship Side, till at last the
Men rowing very heartily, and venturing their Lives to save ours, our Men
cast them a Rope over the Stern with a Buoy to it, and then vered it out
a great Length, which they after great Labour and Hazard took hold of and
we hall'd them close under our Stern and got all into their Boat. It was
to no Purpose for or us after we were in the Boat to think of reaching
to own Ship, so all agreed to let her drive and only to pull her in towards
Shore as much as we could, and our Master promised them, That if the Boat
was stav'd upon Shore he would make it good to their Master, so partly
rowing and partly driving our Boat went away to the Norward sloaping wards
the Shore almost as far as <I>Winterton Ness</I>.

<P>We were not much more than a quarter of an Hour out four Ship but we
saw her sink, and then I understood for the first time what was meant by
a Ship foundering in the Sea; I must acknowledge I had hardly Eyes to look
up when he Seamen told me she was sinking; for from that Moment hey rather
put me into the Boat than that I might be said to go in, my Heart was as
it were dead within me, partly with Fright, partly with Horror of Mind
and the Thoughts of what was yet before me.

<P>While we were in this Condition, the Men yet labouring the Oar to bring
the Boat near the Shore, we could see, hen our Boat mounting the Waves,
we were able to see the Shore, a great many People running along the Shore
to assist us when we should come near, but we made but slow way towards
the Shore, nor were we able to reach the Shore, till being past the Light-House
at <I>Winterton</I>, the Shore falls off to the Westward towards <I>Cromer</I>,
and so the Land broke off a little the Violence of the Wind: Here we got
in, and tho' not without much Difficulty got all safe on Shore and walk'd
afterwards on Foot to <I>Yarmouth</I>, where, as unfortunate Men, we were
used with great Humanity as well by the Magistrates of the Town, who assign'd
us good Quarters, as by particular Merchants and Owners of Ships, and had
Money given us sufficient to carry us either to <I>London</I> or back to
<I>Hull</I>, as we thought fit.

<P>Had I now had the Sense to have gone back to <I>Hull</I>, and have gone
home, I had been happy, and my Father, an Emblem of our Blessed Saviour's
Parable, had even kill'd the fatted Calf for me; for hearing the Ship I
went away in was cast away in Yarmouth Road, it was a great while before
he had any Assurance that I was not drown'd.

<P>But my ill Fate push'd me on now with an Obstinacy that nothing could
resist; and tho' I had several times loud Calls from my Reason and my more
composed Judgment to go home, yet I had no Power to do it. I know not what
to call this, nor will I urge, that it is a secret over-ruling Decree that
hurries us on to be the Instruments of our own Destruction, even tho' it
be before us, and that we rush upon it with our Eyes open. Certainly nothing
but some such decreed unavoidable Misery attending, and which it was impossible
for me to escape, could have push'd me forward against the calm Reasonings
and Perswasions of my most retired Thoughts, and against two such visible
Instructions as I had met with in my first Attempt.

<P>My Comrade, who had help'd to harden me before, and who was the Master's
Son, was now less forward than I; the first time he spoke to me after we
were at <I>Yarmouth</I>, which was not till two or three Days, for we were
separated in the Town to several Quarters; I say, the first time he saw
me, it appear'd his Tone was alter'd, and looking very melancholy and shaking
his Head, ask'd me how I did, and telling his Father who I was, and how
I had come this Voyage only for a Trial in order to go farther abroad;
his Father turning to me with a very grave and concern'd Tone, <I>Young
Man</I>, says he, <I>you ought never to go to Sea any more, you ought to
take his for a plain and visible Token that you are not to be a Seafaring
Man</I>. Why, Sir, said I, will you go to Sea no more? <I>That is another
Case</I>, said he, <I>it is my Calling, and therefore my Duty; but as you
made this Voyage for a Trial, you see what a Taste Heaven has given you
of what you are to expect if you persist; perhaps this is all befallen
us on your Account, like Jonah in the Ship of</I> Tarshish. <I>Pray</I>,
continues he, <I>what are you? and on what Account did you go to Sea?</I>
Upon that I told him some of my Story; at the End of which he burst out
with a strange kind of Passion, What had I done, says he, that such an
unhappy Wretch should come into my Ship? I would not set my Foot in the
same Ship with thee again for a Thousand Pounds. This indeed was, as I
said, an Excursion of his Spirits which were yet agitated by the Sense
of his Loss, and was farther than he could have Authority to go. However
he afterwards talk'd very gravely to me, exhorted me to go back to my Father,
and not tempt Providence to my Ruine; told me I might see a visible Hand
of Heaven against me, <I>And young Man</I>, said he, <I>depend upon it,
if you do not go back, where-ever you go, you will meet with nothing but
Disasters and Disappointments till your Father's Words are fulfilled upon
you.</I>

<P>We parted soon after; for I made him little Answer, and I saw him no
more; which way he went, I know not. As for me, having some Money in my
Pocket, I travelled to <I>London</I> by Land; and there, as well as on
the Road, had many Struggles with my self, what Course of Life I should
take, and whether I should go Home, or go to Sea.

<P>As to going Home, Shame opposed the best Motions that offered to my
Thoughts; and it immediately occurr'd to me how I should be laugh'd at
among the Neighbours, and should be asham'd to see, not my Father and Mother
only, but even every Body else; from whence I have since often observed,
how incongruous and irrational the common Temper of Mankind is, especially
of Youth, to that Reason which ought to guide them in such Cases, <I>viz</I>.
That they are not asham'd to sin, and yet are asham'd to repent; not asham'd
of the Action for which they ought justly to be esteem'd Fools, but are
asham'd of the returning, which only can make them be esteem'd wise Men.

<P>In this of Life however I remained some time, uncertain what Measures
to take, and what Course of Life to lead. An irresistible Reluctance continu'd
to going Home; and as I stay'd a while, the Remembrance of the Distress
I had been in wore off; and as that abated, the little Motion I had in
my Desires to a Return wore off with it, till at last I quite lay'd aside
the Thoughts of it, and lookt out for a Voyage.

<P>That evil Influence which carryed me first away from my Father's House,
that hurried me into the wild and indigested Notion of raising my Fortune;
and that imprest those Conceits so forcibly upon me, as to make me deaf
to all good Advice, and to the Entreaties and even Command of my Father:
I say the same Influence, whatever it was, presented the most unfortunate
of all Enterprises to my View; and I went on board a Vessel bound to the
Coast of <I>Africa</I>; or, as our Sailors vulgarly call it, a Voyage to
<I>Guinea</I>.

<P>It was my great Misfortune that in all these Adventures I did not ship
my self as a Sailor; whereby, tho' I might indeed have work'd a little
harder than ordinary, yet at the same time I had learn'd the Duty and Office
of a Fore-mast Man; and in might have qualified my self for a Mate or Lieutenant,
ifs a Master: But as it was always my Fate to choose for the worse, so
I did here; for having Money in my Pocket, and good Cloaths upon my Back,
I would always go on board in the Habit of a Gentleman; and so I neither
had any Business Ship, or learn'd to do any.

<P>It was my Lot first of all to fall into pretty good Company in <I>London</I>
which does not always happen to such loose and unguided young Fellows as
I then was; the Devil generally not omitting to lay some Snare for them
very early: But it was not as with me, I first fell acquainted with the
Master of a Ship who had been on the Coast of <I>Guinea</I>; and who having
had very good Success there, was resolved to go again; and who taking a
Fancy to my Conversation, which was not at all disagreeable at that time,
hearing me say I had a mind to see the World, told me if I wou'd go the,
Voyage with him I should be at no Expence; I should be his Mess-mate and
his Companion, and if I could carry any thing with me, I should have all
the Advantage of it that the Trade would admit; and perhaps I might meet
with some Encouragement.

<P>I embrac'd the Offer, and entring into a strict Friendship with this
Captain, who was an honest and plain-dealing Man, I went the Voyage with
him, and carried a small Adventure with me, which by the disinterested
Honesty of my Friend the Captain, I increased very considerably; for I
carried about 40 <I>l</I>. in such Toys and Trifles as the Captain directed
me to buy. This 40 <I>l</I>. I had mustered together by the Assistance
of some of my Relations whom I corresponded with, and who, I believe, got
my Father, or at least my Mother, to contribute so much as that to my first
Adventure.

<P>This was the only Voyage which I may say was successful in all my Adventures,
and which I owe to the Integrity and Honesty of my Friend the Captain,
under whom also I got a competent Knowledge of the Mathematicks and the
Rules of Navigation, learn'd how to keep an Account of the Ship's Course,
take an Observation; and in short, to understand some things that were
needful to be understood by a Sailor: For, as he took Delight to introduce
me, I took Delight to learn; and, in a word, this Voyage made me both a
Sailor and a Merchant: for I brought Home <I>L</I>. 5. 9 <I>Ounces </I>of
Gold Dust for my Adventure, which yielded me in London at my Return, almost
300 <I>l</I>. and this fill'd me with those aspiring Thoughts which have
since so compleated my Ruin.

<P>Yet even in this Voyage I had my Misfortunes too; particularly, that
I was continually sick, being thrown into a violent Calenture by the excessive
Heat of the Climate; our principal Trading being upon the Coast, from the
Latitude of 15 Degrees, North even to the Line it self.

<P>I was now set up for a <I>Guiney</I> Trader; and my Friend, to my great
Misfortune, dying soon after his Arrival, I resolved to go the same Voyage
again, and I embark'd in the same Vessel with one who was his Mate in the
former Voyage, and had now got the Command of the Ship. This was the unhappiest
Voyage that ever Man made; for tho' I did not carry quite 100 l. of my
new gain'd Wealth, so that I had 200 left, and which I lodg'd with my Friend's
Widow, who was very just to me, yet I fell into terrible Misfortunes in
this Voyage; and the first was this, <I>viz</I>. Our Ship making her Course
towards the <I>Canary</I> Islands, or rather between those Islands and
the African Shore, was surprised in the Grey of the Morning, by a <I>Turkish</I>
Rover of Sallee, who gave Chase to us with all the Sail she could make.
We crowded also as much Canvas as our Yards would spread, or our Masts
carry, to have got clear; but finding the Pirate gain'd upon us, and would
certainly come up with us in a few Hours, we prepar'd to fight; our Ship
having 12 Guns, and the Rogue 18. About three in the Afternoon he came
up with us, and bringing to by Mistake, just athwart our Quarter, instead
of athwart our Stern, as he intended, we brought 8 of our Guns to bear
on that Side, and pour'd in a Broadside upon him, which made him sheer
off again, after returning our Fire, and pouring in also his small Shot
from near 200 Men which he had on Board. However, we had not a Man touch'd,
all our Men keeping close. He prepar'd to attack us again, and we to defend
our selves; but laying us on Board the next time upon our other Quarter,
he entred 60 Men upon our Decks, who immediately fell to cutting and hacking
the Decks and Rigging. We ply'd them with Small-shot, Half-Pikes, Powder-Chests,
and such like, and clear'd our Deck of them twice. However, to cut short
this melancholly Part of our Story, our Ship being disabled, and three
of our Men kill'd, and eight wounded, we were obliged to yield, and were
carry'd all Prisoners into <I>Sallee</I>, a Port belonging to the <I>Moors</I>.

<P>The Usage I had there was not so dreadful as at first I apprehended,
nor was I carried up the Country to the Emperor's Court, as the rest of
our Men were, but was kept by the Captain of the Rover, as his proper Prize,
and made is Slave, being young and nimble, and fit for his Business. At
this surprising Change of my Circumstances from a Merchant to a miserable
Slave, I was perfectly overwhelmed; and now I look'd back upon my Father's
prophetick Disourse to me, that I should be miserable, and have none to
relieve me, which I thought was now so effectually brought pass, that it
could not be worse; that now the Hand of Heaven had overtaken me, and I
was undone without Redemption. But alas! this was but a Taste of the Misery
I was to go thro', as will appear in the Sequel of this Story.

<P>As my new Patron or Master had taken me Home to his House, so I was
in hopes that he would take me with him hen he went to Sea again, believing
that it would some time or other be his Fate to be taken by a <I>Spanish</I>
or <I>Portugal</I> an of War; and that then I should be set at Liberty.
But his Hope of mine was soon taken away; for when he went to Sea, he left
me on Shoar to look after his little Garden, and do the common Drudgery
of Slaves about his House; and when he came home again from his Cruise,
he order'd me to lye in the Cabbin to look after the Ship.

<P>Here I meditated nothing but my Escape; and what Method I might take
to effect it, but found no Way that had the least Probability in it: Nothing
presented to make the Supposition of it rational; for I had no Body to
communicate it to, that would embark with me; no Fellow-Slave, no <I>Englishman,
Irishman</I>, or <I>Scotsman</I> there but my self; so that for two Years,
tho' I often pleased my self with the Imaginaion, yet I never had the least
encouraging Prospect of putting it in Practice.

<P>After about two Years an odd Circumstance presented it self which put
the old Thought of making some Attempt for my Liberty, again in my Head:
My Patron lying at Home longer than usual, without fitting out his Ship,
which, as I heard, was for want of Money; he used constantly, once or twice
a Week, sometimes oftner, if the Weather was fair, to take the Ship's Pinnace,
and go Out into the Road a-fishing; and as he always took me and a young
Maresco with him to row the Boat, we made him very merry, and I prov'd
very dexterous in catching Fish; insomuch that sometimes he would send
me with a <I>Moor</I>, one of his Kinsmen, and the Youth the Maresco, as
they call'd him, to catch a Dish of Fish for him.

<P>It happen'd one time, that going a fishing in a stark calm Morning,
a Fog rose so thick, that tho' we were not half a League from the Shoar
we lost Sight of it; and rowing we knew not whither or which way, we labour'd
all Day and all the next Night, and when the Morning came we found we had
pull'd off to Sea instead of pulling in for the Shoar; and that we were
at least two Leagues from the Shoar: However we got well in again, tho'
with a great deal of Labour, and some Danger; for the Wind began to blow
pretty fresh in the Morning; but particularly we were all very hungry.

<P>But our Patron warn'd by this Disaster, resolved to take more Care of
himself for the future; and having lying by him the Long-boat of our <I>English</I>
Ship we had taken, he resolved he would not go a fishing any more without
a Compass and some Provision; so he ordered the Carpenter of his Ship,
who also was an <I>English</I> Slave, to build a little State-room or Cabin
in the middle of the Long Boat, like that of a Barge, with a Place to stand
behind it to steer and hale home the Main-sheet; and Room before for a
hand or two to stand and work the Sails; she sail'd with that we call a
Shoulder of Mutton Sail; and the Boom gib'd over the Top of the Cabbin,
which lay very snug and low, and had in it Room for him to lye, with a
Slave or two, and a Table to eat on, with some small Lockers to put in
some Bottles of such Liquor as he thought fit to drink in; particularly
his Bread, Rice and Coffee.

<P>We went frequently out with this Boat a fishing, and as I was most dextrous
to catch fish for him, he never went without me: It happen'd that he had
appointed to go out in this Boat, either for Pleasure or for Fish, with
two or three <I>Moors</I> of some Distinction in that Place, and for whom
he had provided extraordinarily; and had therefore sent on board the Boat
over Night, a larger Store of Provisions than ordinary; and had order'd
me to get ready three Fuzees with Powder and Shot, which were on board
his Ship; for that they design'd some Sport of Fowling as well as Fishing.

<P>I got all things ready as he had directed, and waited the next Morning
with the Boat, washed clean, her Antient and Pendants out, and every thing
to accomodate his Guests; when by and by my Patroon came on board alone,
and told me his Guests had put off going, upon some Business that fell
out, and order'd me with the Man and Boy, as usual, to go out with the
Boat and catch them some Fish, for that his friends were to sup at his
House; and commanded that as soon as I had got some Fish I should bring
it home to his House; all which I prepar'd to do.

<P>This Moment my former Notions of Deliverance darted into my Thoughts,
for now I found I was like to have a little Ship at my Command; and my
Master being gone, I prepar'd to furnish my self, not for a fishing Business
but for a Voyage; tho' I knew not, neither did I so much as consider whither
I should steer; for any where to get out of that Place was my Way.

<P>My first Contrivance was to make a Pretence to speak to this Moor, to
get something for our Subsistance on board; for I told him we must not
presume to eat of our Patroon's Bread, he said that was true; so he brought
a large Basket of Rusk or Bisket of their kind, and three Jarrs with fresh
Water into the Boat; I knew where my Patroon's Case of Bottles stood, which
it was evident by the make were taken out of some <I>English</I> Prize;
and I convey'd them into the Boat while the <I>Moor</I> was on Shoar, as
if they had been there before, for our Master: I convey'd also a great
Lump of Bees-Wax into the Boat, which weighed above half a Hundred Weight,
with a Parcel of Twine or Thread, a Hatchet, a Saw and a Hammer, all which
were of great Use to us afterwards; especially the Wax to make Candles.
Another Trick I try'd upon him, which he innocently came into also; his
Name was <I>Ismael</I>, who they call <I>Muly</I> or <I>Moely</I>, so I
call'd to him, <I>Moely</I> said I, our Patroon's Guns are on board the
Boat, can you not get a little Powder and Shot, it may be we may kill some
<I>Alcamies</I> (a Fowl like our <I>Curlieus</I>) for our selves, for I
know he keeps the Gunners Stores in the Ship? Yes, <I>says he</I>, I'll
bring some, and accordingly he brought a great Leather Pouch which held
about a Pound and half of Powder, or rather more; and another with Shot,
that had five or six Pound, with some Bullets; and put all into the Boat:
At the same time I had found some Powder of my Master's in the Great Cabbin,
with which I fill'd one of the large Bottles in the Case, which was almost
empty; pouring what was in it into another: and thus furnished with every
thing needful, we sail'd out of the Port to fish: The Castle which is at
the Entrance of the Port knew who we were, and took no Notice of us; and
we were not above a Mile out of the Port before we hal'd in our Sail, and
set us down to fish: The Wind blew from the N.NE. which was contrary to
my Desire; for had it blown southerly I had been sure to have made the
Coast of <I>Spain</I>, and at least reacht to the Bay of <I>Cadiz</I>;
but my Resolutions were, blow which way it would, I would be gone from
that horrid Place where I was, and leave the rest to Fate.

<P>After we had fisht some time and catcht nothing, for when I had Fish
on my Hook, I would not pull them up, that he might not see them; I said
to the <I>Moor</I>, this will not do, our Master will not be thus serv'd,
we must stand farther off: He thinking no harm agreed, and being in the
head of the Boat set the Sails; and as I had the Helm I run she Boat out
near a League farther, and then brought her too as if I would fish; when
giving the Boy the Helm, I stept forward to where the <I>Moor</I> was,
and making as if I stoopt for something behind him, I took him by Surprize
with my Arm under his Twist, and tost him clear over-board into the Sea;
he rise immediately, for he swam like a Cork, and call'd to me, begg'd
to be taken in, told me he would go all over the World with me; he swam
so strong after the oat that he would have reacht me very quickly, there
being but little Wind; upon which I stept into the Cabbin and fetching
one of the Fowling-pieces, I presented it at him, and told him, I had done
him no hurt, and if he would be quiet I would do him none; but said I,
you swim well enough to reach to the Shoar, and the Sea is calm, make the
est of your Way to Shoar and I will do you no harm, but if you come near
the Boat I'll shoot you thro' the Head; for I'm resolved to have my Liberty;
so he turn'd himself about and swam for the Shoar, and I make no doubt
but he reacht it with Ease, for he was an Excellent Swimmer.

<P>I could ha' been content to ha' taken this <I>Moor</I> with me, and
ha' drown'd the Boy, but there was no venturing to trust him: When he was
gone I turn'd to the Boy, who they call'd <I>Xury</I>, and said to him,
<I>Xury</I>, if you will be faithful to me I'll make you a great man, but
if you will not stroak our Face to be true to me, <I>that is, swear by</I>
Mahomet <I>and is Father's Beard</I>, I must throw you into the Sea too;
the boy smil'd in my Face and spoke so innocently that I could mistrust
him; and swore to be faithful to me, and go all over the World with me.

<P>While I was in View of the <I>Moor</I> that was swimming, I stood out
directly to Sea with the Boat, rather stretching to Windward, that they
might think me gone towards the <I>Straits</I>-mouth (as indeed any one
that had been in their wits must ha' been supposed to do), or who would
ha' suppos'd we were sail'd on to the southward to the truly <I>Barbarian</I>
Coast, where whole Nations of Negroes were sure to surround us with their
Canoes, and destroy us; where we could ne'er once go on shoar but we should
be devour'd by savage Beasts, or more merciless Savages of humane kind.

<P>But as soon as it grew dusk in the Evening, I chang'd my Course, and
steer'd directly South and by East, bending my Course a little toward the
East, that I might keep in with the Shoar; and having a fair fresh Gale
of Wind, and a smooth quiet Sea, I made such Sail that I believe by the
next Day at Three a Clock in the Afternoon, when I first made the Land,
I could not be less than 150 Miles South of <I>Sallee</I>; quite beyond
the Emperor of <I>Morocco's</I> Dominions, or indeed of any other King
thereabouts, for we saw no People.

<P>Yet such was the Fright I had taken at the <I>Moors</I>, and the dreadful
Apprehensions I had of falling into their Hands, that I would not stop,
or go on Shoar, or come to an Anchor; the Wind continuing fair, 'till I
had sail'd in that manner five Days: And then the Wind shifting to the
southward, I concluded also that if any of our Vessels were in Chase of
me, they also would now give over; so I ventur'd to make to the Coast,
and came to an Anchor in the Mouth of a little River, I knew not what,
or where; neither what Latitude, what Country, what Nations, or what River:
I neither saw, or desir'd to see any People, the principal thing I wanted
was fresh Water: We came into this Creek in the Evening, resolving to swim
on shoar as soon as it was dark, and discover the Country; but as soon
as it was quite dark, we heard such dreadful Noises of the Barking, Roaring,
and Howling of Wild Creatures, of we knew not what Kinds, that the poor
Boy was ready to die with Fear, and beg'd of me not to go on shoar till
Day; well <I>Xury </I>said I, then I won't, but it may be we may see Men
by Day, who will be as bad to us as those Lyons; <I>then me give them the
shoot Gun</I> says <I>Xury</I> laughing, <I>make them run wey</I>; such
<I>English Xury</I> spoke by conversing among us Slaves; however I was
glad to see the Boy so cheerful, and I gave him a Dram (out of our Patroon's
Case of Bottles) to chear him up: After all, <I>Xury's</I> Advice was good,
and I took it, we dropt our little Anchor and lay still all Night; I say
still, for we slept none! for in two or three Hours we saw vast great Creatures
(we knew not what to call them) of many sorts, come down to the Sea-shoar
and run into the Water, wallowing and washing themselves for the Pleasure
of cooling themselves; and they made such hideous Howlings and Yellings,
that I never indeed heard the like.

<P><I>Xury</I> was dreadfully frighted, and indeed so was I too; but we
were both more frighted when we heard one of these mighty Creatures come
swimming towards our Boat, we could not see him, but we might hear him
by his blowing to be a monstrous, huge and furious Beast; <I>Xury</I> said
it was a Lyon, and it might be so for ought I know; but poor <I>Xury</I>
cryed to me to weigh the Anchor and row away; no says I, <I>Xury</I>, we
can slip our Cable with the Buoy to it and go off to Sea, they cannot follow
us far; I had no sooner said so, but I perceiv'd the Creature (whatever
it was) within Two Oars Length, which something surprized me; however I
immediately stept to the Cabbin-door, and taking up my un fir'd at him,
upon which he immediately turn'd about and swam towards the Shoar again.

<P>But it is impossible to describe the horrible Noises, and hideous Cryes
and Howlings, that were raised as well upon the Edge of the Shoar, as higher
within the Country; upon the Noise or Report of the Gun, a Thing I have
some Reason to believe those Creatures had never heard before: This Convinc'd
me that there was no going on Shoar for us in the Night upon that Coast,
and how to venture on Shoar in the Day was another Question too; for to
have fallen into the Hands of any of the Savages, had been as bad as to
have fallen into the Hands of Lyons and Tygers; at least we were equally
apprehensive of the Danger of it.

<P>Be that as it would, we were oblig'd to go on Shoar somewhere or other
for Water, for we had not a Pint left in the Boat; when or where to get
to it was the Point: <I>Xury</I> said, if I would let him go on Shoar with
one of the Jarrs, he would find if there was any Water and bring some to
me. I ask'd him why he would go? Why I should not go and he stay in the
Boat? The Boy answer'd with so much Affection that made me love him ever
after. Says he, <I>If wild Mans come, they eat me, you go wey</I>. Well,
<I>Xury</I>, said I, we will both go, and if the wild Mans come we will
kill them, they shall eat neither of us; so I gave <I>Xury</I> a piece
of Rusk-bread to Eat and a Dram out of our Patroon's Case of Bottles which
I mentioned before; and we hal'd the Boat in as near the Shoar as we thought
was proper, and so waded on Shoar, carrying nothing but our Arms and two
Jarrs for Water.

<P>I did not care to go out of Sight of the Boat, fearing the coming of
Canoes with <I>Savages</I> down the River; but the Boy seeing a low Place
about a Mile up the Country rambled to it; and by and by I saw him come
running towards me, I thought he was pursued by some Savage, or frighted
with some wild Beast, and I run forward towards him to help him, but when
I came nearer to him, I saw something hanging over his Shoulders which
was a Creature that he had shot, like a Hare but different in Colour, and
longer Legs, however we were very glad of it, and it was very good Meat;
but the great Joy that poor <I>Xury</I> came with, was to tell me he had
found good Water and seen no wild Mans.

<P>But we found afterwards that we need not take such Pains for Water,
for a little higher up the Creek where we were, we found the Water fresh
when the Tide was out, which flowed but a little way up; so we filled our
Jarrs and feasted on the Hare we had killed, and prepared to go on our
Way, having seen no Foot-steps of any humane Creature in that part of the
Country.

<P>As I had been one Voyage to this Coast before, I knew very well that
the Islands of the <I>Canaries</I>, and the <I>Cape de Verd</I> Islands
also, lay not far off from the Coast. But as I had no Instruments to take
an Observation to know what Latitude we were in, and did not exactly know,
or at least remember what Latitude they were in; I knew not where to look
for them, or when to stand off to Sea towards them; otherwise I might now
easily have found some of these Islands. But my hope was, that if I stood
along this Coast till I came to that Part where the <I>English</I> Traded,
I should find some of their Vessels upon their usual Design of Trade, that
would relieve and take us in.

<P>By the best of my Calculation, that Place where I now was, must be that
Country, which lying between the Emperor of <I>Morocco's</I> Dominions
and the <I>Negro's</I>, lies wast and uninhabited, except by wild Beasts;
the <I>Negroes</I> having abandon'd it and gone farther South for fear
of the <I>Moors</I>; and the Moors not thinking it worth inhabiting, by
reason of its Barrenness; and indeed both forsaking it because of the prodigious
Numbers of Tygers, Lyons, Leopards and other furious Creatures which harbour
there; so that the <I>Moors</I> use it for their Hunting only, where they
go like an Army, two or three thousand Men at a time; and indeed for near
an hundred Miles together upon this Coast, we saw nothing but a wast uninhabited
Country, by Day; and heard nothing but Howlings and Roaring of wild Beasts,
by Night.

<P>Once or twice in the Day time, I thought I saw the <I>Pico</I> of <I>Teneriffe</I>,
being the high top of the Mountain <I>Teneriffe</I> in the <I>Canaries</I>;
and had a great mind to venture out in hopes of reaching thither; but having
tried twice I was forced in again by contrary Winds, the Sea also going
too high for my little Vessel, so I resolved to pursue my first Design
and keep along the Shoar.

<P>Several times I was obliged to land for fresh Water, after we had left
this Place; and once in particular, being early in the Morning, we came
to an Anchor under a little Point of Land which was pretty high, and the
Tide beginning to flow, we lay still to go farther in; <I>Xury</I>, whose
Eyes were more about him than it seems mine were, calls softly to me, and
tells me that we had best go farther off the Shoar; for, bays he, look
yonder lies a dreadful Monster on the side of that Hillock fast asleep:
I look'd where he pointed, and saw a dreadful Monster indeed, for it was
a terrible great Lyon that lay on the Side of the Shoar, under the Shade
of a Piece of the Hill that hung as it were a little over him. <I>Xury</I>,
says I, you shall go on Shoar and kill him; <I>Xury</I> look'd frighted,
and said, <I>Me kill! he eat me at one Mouth</I>; one Mouthful he meant;
however, I said no more to the Boy, but bad him lye still, and I took our
biggest Gun, which was almost Musquet-bore, and loaded it with a good Charge
of Powder, and with two Slugs, and laid it down; then I loaded another
Gun with two Bullets, and the third, for we had three Pieces, I loaded
with five smaller Bullets, I took the best aim I could with the first Piece
to have shot him into the Head, but he lay so with his Leg rais'd a little
above his Nose, that the Slugs hit his Leg about the Knee, and broke the
Bone. He started up growling at first, but finding his Leg broke fell down
again, and then got up upon three Legs and gave the most hideous Roar that
ever I heard; I was a little suppriz'd that I had not hit him on the Head;
however I took up the second Piece immediately, and tho' he began to move
off fir'd again, and shot him into the Head, and had the Pleasure to see
him drop, and make but little Noise, but lay struggling for Life, Then
<I>Xury</I> took Heart, and would have me let him go on Shoar: Well, go
said I, so the Boy jump'd into the Water, and taking a little Gin in one
Hand swam to Shoar with the other Hand, and coming close to the Creature,
put the Muzzle of the Piece to his Ear, and shot him into the Head again
which dispatch'd him quite.

<P>This was Game indeed to us, but this was no Food, and I was very sorry
to lose three Charges of Powder and Shot upon a Creature that was good
for nothing to us. However <I>Xury</I> said he would have some of him;
so he comes on board, and ask'd me to give him the Hatchet; for what, <I>Xury</I>,
said I? <I>Me cut off his Head</I>, said he. However <I>Xury</I> could
not cut off his Head, but he cut off a Foot and brought it with him, and
it was a monstrous great one.

<P>I bethought my self however, that perhaps the Skin of him might one
way or other be of some Value to us; and I resolved to take off his Skin
if I could. So <I>Xury</I> and I went to work with him; but <I>Xury</I>
was much the better Workman at it, for I knew very ill how to do it. Indeed
it took us up both the whole Day, but at last we got off the Hide of him,
and spreading it on the top of our Cabbin, the Sun effectually dried it
in two Days time, and it afterwards serv'd me to lye upon.

<P>After this Stop we made on to the Southward continually for ten or twelve
Days, living very sparing on our Provisions, which began to abate very
much, and going no oftner into the Shoar than we were oblig'd to for fresh
Water; my Design in this was to make the River <I>Gambia</I> or <I>Sennegall</I>,
that is to say, any where about the <I>Cape de Yerd</I>, where I was in
hopes to meet with some <I>European</I> Ship, and if I did not, I knew
not what Course I had to take, but to seek out for the <I>Islands</I>,
or perish there among the <I>Negroes</I>. I knew that all the Ships from
<I>Europe</I>, which sail'd either to the Coast of <I>Guiney</I>, or to
<I>Brasil</I>, or to the <I>East-Indies</I>, made this <I>Cape</I> or those
<I>Islands</I>; and in a word, I put the whole of Fortune upon this Single
Point, either that I must meet with some Ship, or must perish.

<P>When I had pursued this Resolution about ten Days longer, as I have
said, I began to see that the Land was inhabited, and in two or three Places
as we sailed by, we saw People stand upon the Shoar to look at us, we could
also perceive they were quite Black and Stark-naked. I was once inclin'd
to ha' gone on Shoar to them; but <I>Xury</I> was my better Councellor,
and said to me, <I>no go, no go</I>; however I hal'd in nearer the Shoar
that I might talk to them, and I found they run along the Shoar by me a
good way; I observ'd they had no Weapons in their Hands, except one who
had a slender Stick, which <I>Xury</I> said was a Lance, and that could
throw them a great way with good aim; so I kept at a distance, but talk'd
with them by Signs as well as I could particularly made Signs for some
thing to Eat, they to me to stop my Boat, and that they would Meat; upon
this I lower'd the top of my Sail, and lay two of them run up into the
Country, and in less Hour came back and brought with them two Pieces of
dry Flesh and some Corn, such as is the Produce of their Country, but we
neither knew what the one the other ever we were willing to accept it,
but how to come at it next Dispute, for I was not for venturing on Shore
to and they were as much affraid us; but they took a safe way for us all,
for they brought it to the Shore and laid it down, and went and stood a
great way off till we fetch'd it on Board, and then came close to us again.

<P>We made Signs of Thanks to them, for we had nothing to make them amends;
but an Opportunity offer'd that very Instant to oblige them wonderfully,
for while we were lying by the Shore, came two mighty Creatures one pursuing
the other, (as we took it) with great Fury, from the Mountains towards
the Sea; whether it was the Male pursuing the Female, or whether they were
in Sport or in Rage, we could not tell, any more than we could tell whether
it was usual or strange, but I believe it was the latter; because in the
first Place, those ravenous Creatures seldom appear but in the Night; and
in the second Place, we found the People terribly frighted, especially
the Women. The Man that had the Lance or Dart did not fly from them, but
the rest did; however as the two Creatures ran directly into the Water,
they did not seem to offer to fall upon any of the <I>Negroes</I>, but
plung'd themselves into the Sea and swam about as if they had come for
their Diversion; at last one of them began to come nearer our Boat than
at first I expected, but I lay ready for him, for I had loaded my Gun with
all possible Expedition, and bad <I>Xury</I> load both the other; as soon
as he came fairly within my reach, I fir'd, and shot him directly into
the Head; immediately he sunk down into the Water, but rose instantly and
plunged up and down as if he was struggling for Life; and so indeed he
was, he immediately made to the Shore, but between the Wound which was
his mortal Hurt, and the strangling of the Water, he dyed just before he
reach'd the Shore.

<P>It is impossible to express the Astonishment of these poor Creatures
at the Noise and the Fire of my Gun; some of them were even ready to dye
for Fear, and fell down as Dead with the very Terror. But when they saw
the Creature dead and sunk in the Water, and that I made Signs to them
to come to the Shore; they took Heart and came to the Shore and began to
search for the Creature, I found him by his Blood staining the Water, and
by the help of a Rope which I flung round him and gave the <I>Negroes</I>
to hawl, they drag'd him on Shore, and found that it was a most curious
Leopard, spotted and fine to an admirable Degree, and the <I>Negroes</I>
held up their Hands with Admiration to think what it was I had kill'd him
with.

<P>The other Creature frighted with the flash of Fire and the Noise of
the Gun swam on Shore, and ran up directly to the Mountains from whence
they came, nor could I at that Distance know what it was. I found quickly
the <I>Negroes</I> were eating the Flesh of this Creature, so I was willing
to have them take it as a Favour from me, which when I made Signs to them
that they might take him, they were very thankful for, immediately they
fell to work with him, and tho' they had no Knife, yet with a sharpen'd
Piece of Wood they-took off his Skin as readily, and much more readily
than we cou'd have done with a Knife; they offer'd me some of the Flesh,
which I declined, making as if I would give it them, but made Signs for
the Skin, which they gave me very freely, and brought me a great deal more
of their Provision, which tho' I did not understand, yet I accepted; then
I made Signs to them for some Water, and held out one of my Jarrs to them,
turning it bottom upward, to shew that it was empty, and that I wanted
to have it filled. They call'd immediately to some of their Friends, and
there came two Women and brought a great Vessel made of Earth, and burnt
as I suppose in the Sun; this they set down for me, as before, and I sent
<I>Xury</I> on Shore with my Jarrs, and filled than all three: The Women
were as stark Naked as the Men.

<P>I was now furnished with Roots and Corn, such as it was, and Water,
and leaving my friendly <I>Negroes</I>, I made forward for about Days more
without offering to go near the hoar, till I saw the Land run out a great
Length into the Sea, at about the Distance of four or five Leagues before
me, and the Sea being very calm I kept a large offing to make this Point;
at doubling the Point at about two Leagues from the Land, I saw plainly
Land on the other Side to Seaward; then I concluded, as it was most certain
indeed, that this was the <I>Cape de Verd</I>, and those the <I>Islands</I>,
call'd from thence <I>Cape de Verd Islands</I>. However they were at a
great Distance, and I could not well tell what I had best to do, for if
I should be taken with a Fresh of Wind I might neither reach one or other.

<P>In this Dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stept into the Cabbin and
Sat me down, <I>Xury</I> having the Helm, when on a suddain the Boy cry'd
out, <I>Master, Master, a Ship with a Sail</I>, and the foolish Boy was
frighted out of his Wits, thinking it must needs be some of his Master's
Ships sent to pursue us, when, I knew we were gotten far enough out their
reach. I jump'd out of the Cabbin, and immediately saw not only the Ship,
but what she was, (<I>viz</I>.) that it was a <I>Portuguese</I> Ship, and
as I thought was bound to the Coast of <I>Guinea</I> for <I>Negroes</I>.
But when I observ'd the Course she steer'd, I was soon convinc'd they were
bound some other way, and did not design to come any nearer to the Shoar;
upon which I stretch'd out to Sea as much as I could, resolving to speak
with them if possible.

<P>With all the Sail I could make, 1 found I should not be able to come
in their Way, but that they would be gone by, before I could make any Signal
to them; but after I had crowded to the utmost, and began to despair, they
it seems saw me by the help of their Perspective-Glasses, and that it some
<I>European</I> Boat, which as they supposed must belong to some Ship that
was lost, so they shortned Sail to let a come up. I was encouraged with
this, and as I had my Patroon's Antient on Board, I made a Waft of it to
them for a Signal of Distress, and fir'd a Gun, both which they saw, for
they told me they saw the Smoke, tho' they did not hear the Gun; upon these
Signals they very kindly brought too, and lay by for me, and in about three
Hours time I came up with them.

<P>They ask'd me what I was, in <I>Portuguese</I>, and in <I>Spanish</I>,
and in <I>French</I>, but I understood none of them; but at last a <I>Scots</I>
Sailor who was on board, call'd to me, and I answer'd him, and told him
I was an <I>Englishman</I>, that I had made my escape out of Slavery from
the <I>Moors</I> at Sallee; then they bad me come on board, and very kindly
took me in, and all my Goods.

<P>It was an inexpressible Joy to me, that any one will believe, that was
thus deliver'd, as I esteem'd it, from such a miserable and almost hopeless
Condition as I was in, and I immediately offered all I had to the Captain
of the Ship, as a Return for my Deliverance; but he generously told me,
he would take nothing from me, but that all I had should be deliver'd safe
to me when I came to the <I>Brasils</I>, for says he, <I>I have sav'd your
Life on no other Terms than I would be glad to be saved my self and it
may one time or other be my Lot to be taken up in the same Condition; besides</I>,
said he, <I>when I carry you to the Brasils, so great a may from your own
Country, if I should take from you what you have, you mill be starved there,
and then I only take away that Life I have given. No, no, Seignor</I> Inglese,
says he, <I>Mr</I>. Englishman, <I>I mill carry you thither in Charity,
and those things mill help you to buy your Subsistance there and your Passage
home again</I>.

<P>As he was Charitable in his Proposal, so he was Just in the Performance
to a tittle, for he ordered the Seamen that none should offer to touch
any thing I had; then he took every thing into his own Possession, and
gave me back an exact Inventory of them, that I might have them, even so
much as my three Earthen Jarrs.

<P>As to my Boat it was a very good one, and that he saw, and told me he
would buy it of me for the Ship's use, and ask'd me what I would have for
it? I told him he had been so generous to me in every thing, that I could
not offer to make any Price of the Boat, but left it entirely to him, upon
which he told me he would give me a Note of his Hand to pay me 80 Pieces
of Eight for it at <I>Brasil</I>, and when it came there, if any one offer'd
to give more he would make it up; he offer'd me also 60 Pieces of Eight
more for my Boy <I>Xury</I>, which I was loath to take, not that I was
not willing to let the Captain have him, but I was very loath to sell poor
Boy's Liberty, who had assisted me so faithfully procuring my own. However
when I let him know my reason, he own'd it to be just, and offer'd me this
Medium, that he would give the Boy an obligation to set him free in ten
Years, if he turn'd Christian; upon this, and <I>Xury</I> saying he was
willing to go him, I let the Captain have him.

<P>We had a very good Voyage to the <I>Brasils</I>, and arriv'd in the
<I>Bay de Todos los Santos</I>, or <I>All-Saints Bay</I>, in about Twenty-two
Days after. And now I was once more deliver'd from the most miserable of
all Conditions of Life, and what to do next with my self I was now to consider.

<P>The generous Treatment the Captain gave me, I can never enough remember;
he would take nothing of me for my Passage, gave me twenty Ducats for the
Leopard's Skin, and forty for the Lyon's Skin which I had in my Boat, and
caused every thing I had in the Ship to be punctually deliver'd me, and
what I was willing to sell he bought, such as the Case of Bottles, two
of my Guns, and a Piece of the Lump of Bees-wax, for I had made Candles
of the rest; in a word, I made about 220 Pieces of Eight of all my Cargo,
and with this Stock I went on Shoar in the <I>Brasils</I>.

<P>I had not been long here, but being recommended to the House of a good
honest Man like himself, who had an Ingenio as they call it; that is, a
Plantation and a Sugar-House. I lived with him some time, and acquainted
my self by that means with the Manner of their planting and making of Sugar;
and seeing how well the Planters liv'd, and how they grew rich suddenly,
I resolv'd, if I could get Licence to settle there, I would turn Planter
among them, resolving in the mean time to find out some Way to get my Money
which I had left in <I>London</I> remitted to me. To this Purpose getting
a kind of a Letter of Naturalization, I purchased as much Land that was
Uncur'd, as my Money would reach, and form'd a Plan for my Plantation and
Settlement, and such a one as might be suitable to the Stock which I proposed
to my self to receive from <I>England</I>.

<P>I had a Neighbour, a <I>Portugueze of Lisbon</I>, but born of <I>English</I>
Parents, whose Name was <I>Wells</I>, and in much such Circumstances as
I was. I call him my Neighbour, because his Plantation lay next to mine,
and we went on very sociably together. My Stock was but low as well as
his; and we rather planted for Food than any thing else, for about two
Years. However, we began to increase, and our Land began to come into Order;
so that the third Year we planted some Tobacco, and made each of us a large
Piece of Ground ready for planting Canes in the Year to come; but we both
wanted Help, and now I found more than before, I had done wrong in parting
with my Boy <I>Xury</I>.

<P>But alas! for me to do wrong that never did right, was no great Wonder:
I had no Remedy but to go on; I was gotten into an Employment quite remote
to my Genius, and directly contrary to the Life I delighted in, and for
which I forsook my Father's House, and broke thro' all his good Advice;
nay, I was coming into the very Middle Station, or upper Degree of low
Life, which my Father advised me to before; and which if I resolved to
go on with, I might as well ha' staid at Home, and never have fatigu'd
my self in the World as I had done; and I used often to say to my self,
I could ha' done this as well in <I>England</I> among my Friends, as ha'
gone 5000 Miles off to do it among Strangers and Salvages in a Wilderness,
and at such a Distance, as never to hear from any Part of the World that
had the least Knowledge of me.

<P>In this manner I used to look upon my Condition with the utmost Regret.
I had no body to converse with but now and then Neighbour; no Work to be
done, but by the Labour of my Hands; and I used to say, I liv'd just like
a Man cast some desolate Island, that had no body there but how just has
it been, and how should all Men reflect, that when they compare their present
Conditions with others that are worse, Heaven may oblige them to make the
Exchange, and be convinc'd of their former Felicity by their Experience:
I say, how just has it been, that the truly solitary Life I reflected on
in an Island of meer Desolation should be my Lot, who had so of unjustly
compar'd it with the Life which I then led, which had I continued, I had
in all Probability been exceeding prosperous and rich.

<P>I was in some Degree settled in my Measures for carrying on the Plantation,
before my kind Friend the Captain of the Ship that tool: me up at Sea,
went back; for the Ship remained there in providing his Loading, and preparing
for his Voyage, near three Months, when telling him what little Stock I
had left behind me in <I>London</I>, he gave me this friendly and sincere
Advice, <I>Seignior Inglese says he</I>, for so he always called me, if
you will give me Letters, band a Procuration here in Form to me, with Orders
to the Person who has your Money in <I>London</I>, to send your Effects
to <I>Lisbon</I>, to such Persons as I shall direct and in such Goods as
are proper for this Country, I will bring you the Produce of them, God
willing, at my Return; but since human Affairs are all subject to Changes
and Disasters, I would have you give Orders but for One Hundred Pounds
<I>Sterl</I>. which you say is Half your Stock, and let the Hazard be run
for the first; so that if it come safe, you may order the rest the same
Way; and if it miscarry, you may have the other Half to have Recourse to
for your Supply.

<P>This was so wholesom Advice, and look'd so friendly, that I could not
but be convinc'd it was the best Course I could take; so I accordingly
prepared Letters to the Gentle-woman with whom I had left my Money, and
a Procuration to the Portuguese Captain, as he desired.

<P>I wrote the <I>English</I> Captain's Widow a full Account of all my
Adventures, my Slavery, Escape, and how I had met with the <I>Portugal
</I>Captain at Sea, the Humanity of his Behaviour, and in what Condition
I was now in, with all other necessary Directions for my Supply; and when
this honest Captain came to <I>Lisbon</I>, he found means by some of the
<I>English</I> Merchants there, to send over not the Order only, but a
full Account of my Story to a Merchant at <I>London</I>, who represented
it effectually to her; whereupon, she not only delivered the Money, but
out of her own Pocket sent the <I>Portugal</I> Captain a very handsom Present
for his Humanity and Charity to me.

<P>The Merchant in <I>London</I> vesting this Hundred Pounds in <I>English</I>
Goods, such as the Captain had writ for, sent them directly to him at <I>Lisbon</I>,
and he brought them all safe to me to the <I>Brasils</I>, among which,
without my Direction (for I was too young in my Business to think of them)
he had taken Care to have all Sorts of Tools, Iron-Work, and Utensils necessary
for my Plantation, and which were of great Use to me.

<P>When this Cargo arrived, I thought my Fortunes made, for I was surprised
with the Joy of it; and my good Steward the Captain had laid out the Five
Pounds which my Friend had sent him for a Present for himself, to purchase,
and bring me over a Servant under Bond for six Years Service, and would
not accept of any Consideration, except a little Tobacco, which I would
have him accept, being of my own Produce.

<P>Neither was this all; but my Goods being all <I>English</I> Manufactures,
such as Cloath, Stuffs, Bays, and things particularly valuable and desirable
in the Country, I found means to sell them to a very great Advantage; so
that I might say, I had more than four times the Value of my first Cargo,
and was now infinitely beyond my poor Neighbour, I mean in the Advancement
of my Plantation; for the first thing I did, I bought me a Negro Slave,
and an <I>European</I> Servant also; I mean another besides that which
the Captain brought me from <I>Lisbon</I>.

<P>But as abus'd Prosperity is oftentimes made the very Means of our greatest
Adversity, so was it with me. I went on the next Year with great Success
in my Plantation: I raised fifty great Rolls of Tobacco on my own Ground,
more than I had disposed of for Necessaries among my Neighbours; and these
fifty Rolls being each of above a 100 <I>Wt</I>. were well cur'd and laid
by against the Return of the Fleet from <I>Lisbon</I>: and now increasing
in Business and in Wealth, my Head began to be full of Projects and Undertakings
beyond my Reach; such as are indeed often the Ruine of the best Heads in
Business.

<P>Had I continued in the Station I was now in, I had room for all the
happy things to have yet befallen me, for which my Father so earnestly
recommended a quiet retired Life, and of which he had so sensibly describ'd
the middle Station of Life to be full of; but other things attended me,
and I was still to be the wilful Agent of all my own Miseries; and particularly
to encrease my Fault and double the Reflections upon my self, which in
my future Sorrows I should have leisure to make; all these Miscarriages
were pro by my apparent obstinate adhering to my foolish inclination of
wandring abroad and pursuing that Inclination, in contradiction to the
clearest Views of doing my self good in a fair and plain pursuit of those
Prospects and those measures of Life, which Nature and Providence concurred
to present me with, and to make my Duty.

<P>As I had once done thus in my breaking away from my Parents, so I could
not be content now, but I must go and leave the happy View I had of being
a rich and thriving Man in my new Plantation, only to pursue a rash and
immoderate Desire of rising faster than the Nature of the Thing admitted;
and thus I cast my self down again into the deepest Gulph of human Misery
that ever Man fell into, or perhaps could be consistent with Life and a
State of Health in the World.

<P>To come then by the just Degrees, to the Particulars of this Part of
my Story; you may suppose, that having now lived almost four Years in the
<I>Brasils</I>, and beginning to thrive and prosper very well upon my Plantation;
I had not only learn'd the Language, but had contracted Acquaintance and
Friendship among my Fellow-Planters, as well as among the Merchants at
St. Salvadore, which was our Port; and that in my Discourses among them,
I had frequently given them an Account of my two Voyages to the Coast of
<I>Guinea</I>, the manner of Trading with the <I>Negroes</I> there, and
how easy it was to purchase upon the Coast, for Trifles, such as Beads,
Toys, Knives, Scissars, Hatchets, bits of Glass, and the like; not only
Gold Dust, <I>Guinea</I> Grains, Elephants Teeth, &amp;<I>c</I>. but <I>Negroes</I>
for the Service of the <I>Brasils</I>, in great Numbers.

<P>They listened always very attentively to my Discourses on these Heads,
but especially to that Part which related to the buying <I>Negroes</I>,
which was a Trade at that time not only not far entred into, but as far
as it was, had been carried on by the Assiento's, or Permission of the
Kings of <I>Spain</I> and <I>Portugal</I>, and engross'd in the Publick,
so that few <I>Negroes</I> were brought, and those excessive dear.

<P>It happen'd, being in Company with some Merchants and Planters of my
Acquaintance, and talking of those things very earnestly, three of them
came to me the next Morning, and told me they had been musing very much
urn what I had discoursed with them of, the last Night, and they came to
make a secret Proposal to me; and after enjoining me Secrecy, they told
me, that they had a mind to fit out a Ship to go to <I>Guinea</I>, that
they had all Plantations as well as I, and were straiten'd for nothing
so much as Servants; that as it was a Trade that could not be carried on,
because they could not publickly sell the <I>Negroes</I> when they came
home, so they desired to make but one Voyage, to bring the <I>Negroes</I>
on Shoar privately, and divide them among their own Plantations; and in
a Word, the Question was, whether I would go their Super-Cargo in the Ship
to manage the Trading Part upon the Coast of <I>Guinea</I>? And they offer'd
me that I should have my equal Share of the <I>Negroes</I> without providing
any Part of the Stock.

<P>This was a fair Proposal it must be confess'd, had it been made to one
that had not had a Settlement and Plantation of his own to look after,
which was in a fair way of coming to be very Considerable, and with a good
Stock upon it. But for me that was thus entered and established, and had
nothing to do but go on as I had begun for three or four Years more, and
to have sent for the other hundred Pound from <I>England</I>, and who in
that time, and with that little Addition, could scarce ha' fail'd of being
worth three or four thousand Pounds Sterling, and that encreasing too;
for me to think of such a Voyage, was the most preposterous Thing that
ever Man in such Circumstances could be guilty of.

<P>But I that was born to be my own Destroyer, could no more resist the
Offer than I could restrain my first rambling Designs, when my Father's
good Counsel was lost upon me. In a word, I told them I would go with all
my Heart, if they would undertake to look after my Plantation in my Absence,
and would dispose of it to such as I should direct if I miscarry'd. This
they all engag'd to do, and entred into Writings or Covenants to do so;
and I made a formal Will, disposing of my Plantation and Effects, in Case
of my Death, making the Captain of the Ship that had sav'd my Life as before,
my universal Heir, but obliging him to dispose of my Effects as I had directed
in my Will, one half of the Produce being to himself, and the other to
be ship'd to <I>England</I>.

<P>In short, I took all possible Caution to preserve my Effects, and keep
up my Plantation; had I used half as much Prudence to have look'd into
my own Intrest, and have made a Judgment of what I ought to have done,
and not to have done, I had certainly never gone away from so prosperous
an Undertaking, leaving all the probable Views of a thriving Circumstance,
and gone upon a Voyage to Sea, attended with all its common Hazards; to
say nothing of the Reasons I had to expect particular Misfortunes to my
self.

<P>But I was hurried on, and obey'd blindly the Dictates of my Fancy rather
than my Reason; and accordingly the Ship being fitted out, and the Cargo
furnished, and all things done as by Agreement, by my Partners in the Voyage,
I went on Board in an evil Hour, the [first] of [September], [1659], being
the same Day eight Year that I went from my Father and Mother at <I>Hull</I>,
in order to act the Rebel to their Authority, and the Fool to my own Interest.

<P>Our Ship was about 120 Tun Burthen, carried 6 Guns, and 14 Men, besides
the Master, his Boy, and my self; we had on board no large Cargo of Goods,
except of such Toys as were fit for our Trade with the <I>Negroes</I>,
such as Beads, bits of Glass, Shells, and odd Trifles, especially little
Looking- Glasses, Knives, Scissars, Hatchets, and the like.

<P>The same Day I went on board we set sail, standing away to the Northward
upon our own Coast, with Design to stretch over for the <I>African</I>
Coast, when they came about 10 or 12 Degrees of Northern Latitude, which
it seems was the manner of their Course in those Days. We had very good
Weather, only excessive hot, all the way upon our own Coast, till we came
the Height of <I>Cape</I> St. <I>Augustino</I>, from whence keeping farther
off at Sea we lost Sight of Land, and steer'd as if we was bound for the
Isle <I>Fernand de Horonha</I> holding our Course <I>N.E.</I> by <I>N</I>.
and leaving those Isles on the East; in this Course we past the Line in
about 12 Days time, and were by our last Observation in 7 Degrees 22 Min.
Northern Latitude, when a violent Tournado or Hurricane took us quite out
of our Knowledge: it began from the South-East, came about to the North-West,
and en settled into the North-East, from whence it blew in such a terrible
manner, that for twelve Days together we could do nothing but drive, and
scudding away before it, let it carry us whither ever Fate and the Fury
of the Winds directed; and during these twelve Days, I aced not say, that
I expected every Day to be swallowed up, nor indeed did any in the Ship
expect to save their Lives.

<P>In this Distress, we had besides the Terror of the Storm, one of our
Men dyed of the Calenture, and one Man and the Boy wash'd over board; about
the 12th Day the Weather abating a little, the Master made an Observation
as well as he could, and found that he was in about 11 Degrees North Latitude,
but that he was 22 Degrees of Longitude difference West from <I>Cape</I>
St. Augustino; so that he found he was gotten upon the Coast of <I>Guinea,
</I>or the North Part of <I>Brasil</I>, beyond the River <I>Amozones</I>,
toward that of the River <I>Oronoque</I>, commonly call'd the <I>Great
River</I>, and began to consult with me what Course he should take, for
the Ship leaky and very much disabled, and he was going directly back to
the Coast of <I>Brasil</I>.

<P>I was positively against that, and looking over the Charts the Sea-Coast
of <I>America</I> with him, we concluded the as no inhabited Country for
us to had recourse to, till we came within the Circle of the Carribbe-Islands,
and therefore resolved to stand away for <I>Barbadoes</I>, which by keeping
off at Sea, to avoid the Indraft of the Bay or Gulph of <I>Mexico</I>,
we night easily perform, as we hoped, in about fifteen Day Sail; whereas
we could not possibly make our Voyage to the Coast of <I>Africa</I> without
some Assistance, both to our Ship and to our selves.

<P>With this Design we chang'd our Course and steer'd away <I>N. W.</I>
by <I>W.</I> in order to reach some of our <I>English</I> Islands, where
I hoped for Relief; but our Voyage was otherwise determined, for being
in the Latitude of Deg. 18 Min. a second Storm came upon us, which carry'd
us away with the same Impetuosity Westward, and drove us so out of the
very Way of all humane Commerce, that had all our Lives been saved, as
to the Sea, we were rather in Danger of being devoured by Savages than
ever returning to our own Country. In this Distress, the Wind still blowing
very hard, one of our Men early in the Morning, cry'd out, Land; and we
had no sooner run out of the Cabbin to look out in hopes of seeing where
abouts in the World we were; but the Ship struck upon a Sand, and in a
moment her Motion being so stopp'd, the Sea broke over her in such a manner,
that we expected we should all have perish'd immediately, and we were immediately
driven into our close Quarters to shelter us the very Foam and Sprye of
the Sea.

<P>It is not easy for any one, who has not been in the like Condition,
to describe or conceive the Consternation of Men in such Circumstances;
we knew nothing where we were, or upon what Land it was we were driven,
whether an Island or the Main, whether inhabited or not, inhabited; and
as the Rage of the Wind was still great, tho rather less than at first,
we could not so much as hope to have the Ship hold many Minutes without
breaking in Pieces, unless the Winds by a kind of Miracle should turn immediately
about. In a word, we sat looking upon one another, and expecting Death
every Moment, and every Man acting accordingly, as preparing for another
World, for there was little or nothing more for us to do in this; that
which was our present Comfort, and all the Comfort we had, was, that contrary
to our Expectation the Ship did not break yet, and that the Master said
the Wind began to abate.

<P>Now tho' we thought that the Wind did a little abate, yet the Ship having
thus struck upon the Sand, and sticking too fast for us to expect her getting
off, we were in a dreadful Condition indeed, and had nothing to do but
to think of saving our Lives as well as we could; we had a Boat at our
Stern just before the Storm, but she was first stav'd by dashing against
the Ship's Rudder, and in the next Place she broke away, and either sunk
or was driven off to Sea, so there was no hope from her; we had another
Boat on board, but how to get her off into the Sea, was a doubtful thing;
however there was no room to debate, for we fancy'd the Ship would break
in Pieces every Minute, and some told us she was actually broken already.

<P>In this Distress the Mate of our Vessel lays hold of the Boat, and with
the help of the rest of the Men, they got her flung over the Ship's-side,
and getting all into her, let go, and committed our selves being Eleven
in Number, to God's Merry, and the wild Sea; for tho' the Storm was abated
considerably, yet the Sea went dreadful high upon the Shore, and might
well be call'd, <I>Den mild Zee</I>, as the <I>Dutch</I> call the Sea in
a Storm.

<P>And now our Case was very dismal indeed; for we all saw plainly, that
the Sea went so high, that the Boat could not live, and that we should
be inevitably drowned. As to baking Sail, we had none, nor, if we had,
could we ha' done any thing with it; so we work'd at the Oar towards the
Land, tho' with heavy Hearts, like Men going to Execution; for we all knew,
that when the Boat came nearer the Shore, she would be dash'd in a Thousand
Pieces by the Breach of the Sea. However, we committed our Souls to God
in the most earnest Manner, and the Wind driving us towards the Shore,
we hastened our Destruction with our own Hands, pulling as well as we could
towards Land.

<P>What the Shore was, whether Rock or Sand, whether Steep or Shoal, we
knew not; the only Hope that could rationally give us the least Shadow
of Expectation, was, if we might happen into some Bay or Gulph, or the
Mouth of some River, where by great Chance we might have run our Boat in,
or got under the Lee of the Land, and perhaps made smooth Water. But there
was nothing of this appeared; but as we made nearer and nearer the Shore,
the Land look'd more frightful than the Sea.

<P>After we had row'd, or rather driven about a League and Half, as we
reckon'd it, a raging Wave, Mountain-like, came rowling a-stern of us,
and plainly bad us expect the <I>Coup de Grace</I>. In a word, it took
us with such a Fury, that it overset the Boat at once; and separating us
as well from the Boat, as from one another, gave us not time hardly to
say, O God! for we were all swallowed up in a Moment.

<P>Nothing can describe the Confusion of Thought which I felt when I sunk
into the Water; for tho' I swam very well, yet I could not deliver my self
from the Waves so as to draw Breath, till that Wave having driven me, or
rather carried me a vast Way on towards the Shore, and having spent it
self, went back, and left me upon the Land almost dry, but half-dead with
the Water I took in. I had so much Presence of Mind as well as Breath left,
that seeing my self nearer the main Land than I expected, I got upon my
Feet, and endeavoured to make on towards the Land as fast as I could, before
another Wave should return, and take me up again. But I soon found it was
impossible to avoid it; for I saw the Sea come after me as high as a great
Hill, and as furious as an Enemy which I had no Means or Strength to contend
with; my Business was to hold my Breath, and raise my self upon the Water,
if I could; and so by swimming to preserve my Breathing, and Pilot my self
towards the Shore, if possible; my greatest Concern now being, that the
Sea, as it would carry me a great Way towards the Shore when it came on,
might not carry me back again with it when it gave back towards the Sea.

<P>The Wave that came upon me again, buried me at once 20 or 30 Foot deep
in its own Body; and I could feel my self carried with a mighty Force and
Swiftness towards the Shore a very great Way; but I held my Breath, and
assisted my self to swim still forward with all my Might. I was ready to
burst with holding my Breath, when, as I felt my self rising up, so to
my immediate Relief, I found my Head and Hands shoot out above the Surface
of the Water; and tho' it was not two Seconds of Time that I could keep
my self so, yet it reliev'd me greatly, gave me Breath and new Courage.
I was covered again with Water a good while, but not so long but I held
it out; and finding the Water had spent it self, and began to return, I
strook forward against the Return of the Waves, and felt Ground again with
my Feet. I stood still a few Moments to recover Breath, and till the Water
went from me, and then took to my Heels, and run with what Strength I had
farther towards the Shore. But neither would this deliver me from the Fury
of the Sea, which came pouring in after me again, and twice more I was
lifted up by the Waves, and carried forwards as before, Shore being very
flat.

<P>The last Time of these two had well near been fatal to me; the Sea having
hurried me along as before, landed me, rather dash'd me against a Piece
of a Rock, and that with such Force, as it left me senseless, and indeed
helpless, as my own Deliverance; for the Blow taking my Side and east,
beat the Breath as it were quite out of my Body; and it returned again
immediately, I must have been strangled in the Water; but I recover'd a
little before the turn of the Waves, and seeing I should be cover'd again
with the Water, I resolv'd to hold fast by a Piece of the Rock, and so
to hold my Breath, if possible, till the Wave went back; now as the Waves
were not so high as at first, being nearer Land, I held my Hold till the
Wave abated, and then fetch'd another Run, which brought me so near the
Shore, that the next Wave, tho' it went over me, yet did not so swallow
me up as to carry me away, and the next run I took, I got to the main Land,
where, to my great Comfort, I clamber'd up the Clifts of the Shore, and
sat me down upon the Grass, free from Danger, and quite out of the Reach
of the Water.

<P>I was now landed, and safe on Shore, and began to look up and thank
God that my Life was sav'd in a Case wherein there was some Minutes before
scarce any room to hope. I believe it is impossible to express to the Life
what the Extasies and Transports of the Soul are, when it is so sav'd,
as I may say, out of the very Grave; and I do not wonder now at that Custom,
vis. That when a Malefactor who has the Halter about his Neck, is tyed
up, and just going to be turn'd off, and has a Reprieve brought to him:
I say, I do not wonder that they bring a Surgeon with it, to let him Blood
that very Moment they tell him of it, that the Surprise may not drive the
Animal Spirits from the Heart, and overwhelm him:
<BLOCKQUOTE>For sudden Joys, like Griefs, confound at first.</BLOCKQUOTE>
I walk'd about on the Shore, lifting up my Hands, and my whole Being, as
I may say, wrapt up in the Contemplation of my Deliverance, making a Thousand
Gestures and Motions which I cannot describe, reflecting upon all my Comerades
that were drown'd, and that there should not be one Soul sav'd but my self;
for, as for them, I never saw them afterwards, or any Sign of them, except
three of their Hats, one Cap, and two Shoes that were not Fellows.

<P>I cast my Eyes to the stranded Vessel, when the Breach and Froth of
the Sea being so big, I could hardly see it, it lay so far off, and considered,
Lord! how was it possible I could get on Shore?

<P>After I had solac'd my Mind with the comfortable Part of my Condition,
I began to look round me to see what kind of Place I was in, and what was
next to be done, and I soon found my Comforts abate, and that in a word
I had a dreadful Deliverance: For I was wet, had no Clothes to shift me,
nor any thing either to eat or drink to comfort me, neither did I see any
Prospect before me, but that of perishing with Hunger, or being devour'd
by wild Beasts; and that which was particularly afflicting to me, was,
that I had no Weapon either to hunt and kill any Creature for my Sustenance,
or to defend my self against any other Creature that might desire to kill
me for theirs: In a Word, I had nothing about me but a Knife, a Tobacco-pipe,
and a little Tobacco in a Box, this was all my Provision, and this threw
me into terrible Agonies of Mind, that for a while I run about like a Mad-man;
Night coming upon me, I began with a heavy Heart to consider what would
be my Lot if there were any ravenous Beasts in that Country, seeing at
Night they always come abroad for their Prey.

<P>All the Remedy that offer'd to my Thoughts at that Time, was, to get
up into a thick bushy Tree like a Firr, but thorny, which grew near me,
and where I resolv'd to set all Night, and consider the next Day what Death
I should dye, for as yet I saw no Prospect of Life; I walk'd about a Furlong
from the Shore, to see if I could find any fresh Water to drink, which
I did, to my great Joy; and having drank and put a little Tobacco in my
Mouth to prevent Hunger, I went to the Tree, and getting up into it, endeavour'd
to place my self so, as that if I should sleep I might not fall; and having
cut me a short Stick, like a Truncheon, for my Defence, I took up my Lodging,
and having been excessively fatigu'd, I fell fast asleep, and slept as
comfortably as, I believe, few could have done in my Condition, and found
my self the cost refresh'd with it, that I think I ever was on such an
Occasion.

<P>When I wak'd it was broad Day, the Weather clear, and the Storm abated,
so that the Sea did not rage and swell as before: But that which surpris'd
me most, was, that the Ship was lifted off in the Night from the Sand where
she lay, by the Swelling of the Tyde, and was driven up almost as far as
the Rock which I first mention'd, where I had been so bruis'd by the dashing
me against it; this being within about a Mile from the Shore where I was,
and the Ship seeming to stand upright still, I wish'd my self on board,
that, at least, I might save some necessary things for my use.

<P>When I came down from my Appartment in the Tree, I look'd about me again,
and the first thing I found was the Boat, which lay as the Wind and the
Sea had toss'd her up upon the Land, about two Miles on my right Hand.
I walk'd as far as I could upon the Shore to have got to her, but found
a Neck or Inlet of Water between me and the Boat, which was about half
a Mile broad, so I came back for the present, being more intent upon getting
at the Ship, where I hop'd to find something for my present Subsistence.

<P>A little after Noon I found the Sea very calm, and the Tyde ebb'd so
far out, that I could come within a Quarter of a Mile of the Ship; and
here I found a fresh renewing of my Grief, for I saw evidently, that if
we had kept on board, we had been all safe, that is to say, we had all
got safe on Shore, and I had not been so miserable as to be left entirely
destitute of all Comfort and Company, as I now was; this forc'd Tears from
my Eyes again, but as there was little Relief in that, I resolv'd, if possible,
to get to the Ship, so I pull'd off my Clothes, for the Weather was hot
to Extremity, and took the Water, but when I came to the Ship, my Difficulty
was still greater to know how to get on board, for as she lay a ground,
and high out of the Water, there was nothing within my Reach to lay hold
of; I swam round her twice, and the second Time I spy'd a small Piece of
a Rope, which I wonder'd I did not see at first, hang down by the Fore-Chains
so low, as that with great Difficulty I got hold of it, and by the help
of that Rope, got up into the Forecastle of the Ship; here I found that
the Ship was bulg'd, and had a great deal of Water in her Hold, but that
she lay so on the Side of a Bank of hard Sand, or rather Earth, that her
Stern lay lifted up upon the Bank, and her Head low almost to the Water;
by this Means all her Quarter was free, and all that was in that Part was
dry; for you may be sure my first Work was to search and to see what was
spoil'd and what was free; and first I found that all the Ship's Provisions
were dry and untouch'd by the Water, and being very well dispos'd to eat,
I went to the Bread-room and fill'd my Pockets with Bisket, and eat it
as I went about other things, for I had no time to lose; I also found some
Rum in the great Cabbin, of which I took a large Dram, and which I had
indeed need enough of to spirit me for what was before me: Now I wanted
nothing but a Boat to furnish my self with many things which I forsaw would
be very necessary to me.

<P>It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not to be had, and
this Extremity rouz'd my Application; we had several spare Yards, and two
or three large sparrs of Wood, and a spare Top-mast or two in the Ship;
I resolv'd to fall to work with these, and I flung as many of them over
board as I could manage for their Weight, tying every one with a Rope that
they might not drive away; when this was done I went down the Ship's Side,
and pulling them to me, I ty'd four of them fast together at both Ends
as well as I could, in the Form of a Raft, and laying two or three short
Pieces of Plank upon them cross-ways, I found I could walk upon it very
well, but that it was not able to bear any great Weight, the Pieces being
too light; so I went to work, and with the Carpenter's Saw I cut a spare
Top-mast into three Lengths, and added them to my Raft, with a great deal
of Labour and Pains, but hope of furnishing my self with Necessaries, encourag'd
me to go beyond what I should have been able to have done upon another
Occasion.

<P>My Raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable Weight; my next
Care was what to load it with, and how to preserve what I laid upon it
from the Surf of the Sea; But I was not long considering this, I first
laid all the Plank or Boards upon it that I could get, and having consider'd
well what I most wanted, I first got three of the Seamens Chests, which
I had broken open and empty'd, and lower'd them down upon my Raft; the
first of these I fill'd with Provision, <I>viz</I>. Bread, Rice, three
Dutch Cheeses, five Pieces of dry'd Goat's Flesh, which we liv'd much u'pon,
and a little Remainder of <I>European</I> Corn which had been laid by for
some Fowls which we brought to Sea with us, but the Fowls were kill'd;
there had been some Barly and Wheat together, but, to my great Disappointment,
I found afterwards that the Rats had eaten or spoil'd it all; as for Liquors,
I found several Cases of Bottles belonging to our Skipper, in which some
Cordial Waters, and in all about five or six Gallons of Rack, these I stow'd
by themselves, there being no need to put them into the Chest, nor no room
for them. While I was doing this, I found the Tyde began to flow, tho'
very calm, and I had the Mortification to see my Coat, Shirt, and Wast-coat
which I had left on Shore upon the Sand, swim away; as for my Breeches
which were only Linnen and open knee'd, I swam on board in them and my
Stockings: However this put me upon rummaging for Clothes, of which I found
enough, but took no more than I wanted for present use, for I had other
things which my Eye was more upon, as first Tools to work with on Shore,
and it was after long searching that I found out the Carpenter's Chest,
which was indeed a very useful Prize to me, and much more valuable than
a Ship Loading of Gold would have been at that time; I got it down to my
Raft, even whole as it was, without losing time to look into it, for I
knew in general what it contain'd.

<P>My next Care was for some Ammunition and Arms; there were two very good
Fowling-pieces in the great Cabbin, and two Pistols, these I secur'd first,
with some Powder-horns, and a small Bag of Shot, and two old rusty Swords;
I knew there were three Barrels of Powder in the Ship, but knew not where
our Gunner had stow'd them, but with much search I found them, two of them
dry and good, the third had taken Water, those two I got to my Raft, with
the Arms, and now I thought my self pretty well freighted, and began to
think how I should get to Shore with them, having neither Sail, Oar, or
Rudder, and the least Cap full of Wind would have overset all my Navigation.

<P>I had three Encouragements, 1. A smooth calm Sea, 2. The Tide rising
and setting in to the Shore, 3. What little Wind there was blew me towards
the Land; and thus, having found two or three broken Oars belonging to
the Boat, and besides the Tools which were in the Chest, I found two Saws,
an Axe, and a Hammer, and with this Cargo I put to Sea; For a Mile, or
thereabouts, my Raft went very well, only that I found it drive a little
distant from the Place where I had landed before, by which I perceiv'd
that there was some Indraft of the Water, and consequently I hop'd to find
some Creek or River there, which I might make use of as a Port to get to
Land with my Cargo.

<P>As I imagin'd, so it was, there appear'd before me a little opening
of the Land, and I found a strong Current of the Tide set into it, so I
guided my Raft as well as I could to keep in the Middle of the Stream:
But here I had like to have suffer'd a second Shipwreck, which, if I had,
I think verily would have broke my Heart, for knowing nothing of the Coast,
my Raft run a-ground at one End of it upon a Shoal, and not being a-ground
at the other End, it wanted but a little that all my Cargo had slip'd off
towards that End that was a-float, and so fall'n into the Water: I did
my utmost by setting my Back against the Chests, to keep them in their
Places, but could not thrust off the Raft with all my Strength, neither
durst I stir from the Posture I was in, but holding up the Chests with
all my Might, stood in that Manner near half an Hour, in which time the
rising of the Water brought me a little more upon a Level, and a little
after, the Water still rising, my Raft floated again, and I thrust her
off with the Oar I had, into the Channel, and then driving up higher, I
at length found my self in the Mouth of a little River, with Land on both
Sides, and a strong Current or Tide running up, I look'd on both Sides
for a proper Place to get to Shore, for I was not willing to be driven
too high up the River, hoping in time to see some Ship at Sea, and therefore
resolv'd to place my self as near the Coast as I could.

<P>At length I spy'd a little Cove on the right Shore of the Creek, to
which with great Pain and Difficulty I guided my Raft, and at last got
so near, as that, reaching Ground with my Oar, I could thrust her directly
in, but here I had like to have dipt all my Cargo in the Sea again; for
that Shore lying pretty steep, that is to say sloping, there was no Place
to land, but where one End of my Float, if it run on Shore, would lie so
high, and the other sink lower as before, that it would endanger my Cargo
again: All that I could do, was to wait 'till the Tide was at highest,
keeping the Raft with my Oar like an Anchor to hold the Side of it fast
to the Shore, near a flat Piece of Ground, which I expected the Water would
flow over; and so it did: As soon as I found Water enough, for my Raft
drew about a Foot of Water, I thrust her on upon that flat Piece of Ground,
and there fasten'd or mor'd her by sticking my two broken Oars into the
Ground; one on one Side near one End, and one on the other Side near the
other End; and thus I lay 'till the Water ebb'd away, and left my Raft
and all my Cargo safe on Shore.

<P>My next Work was to view the Country, and seek a proper Place for my
Habitation, and where to stow my Goods to secure them from whatever might
happen; where I was I yet knew not, whether on the Continent or on an Island,
whether inhabited or not inhabited, whether in Danger of wild Beasts or
not: There was a Hill not above a Mile from me, which rose up very steep
and high, and which seem'd to over-top some other Hills which lay as in
a Ridge from it northward; I took out one of the fowling Pieces, and one
of the Pistols, and an Horn of Powder, and thus arm'd I travell'd for Discovery
up to the Top of that Hill, where after I had with great Labour and Difficulty
got to the Top, I saw my Fate to my great Affliction, (<I>viz</I>.) that
I was in an Island environ'd every Way with the Sea, no Land to be seen,
except some Rocks which lay a great Way off, and two small Islands less
than this, which lay about three Leagues to the West.

<P>I found also that the Island I was in was barren, and, as I saw good
Reason to believe, un-inhabited, except by wild Beasts, of whom however
I saw none, yet I saw Abundance of Fowls, but knew not their Kinds, neither
when I kill'd them could I tell what was fit for Food, and what not; at
my coming back, I shot at a great Bird which I saw sitting upon a Tree
on the Side of a great Wood, I believe it was the first Gun that had been
fir'd there since the Creation of the World; I had no sooner fir'd, but
from all the Parts of the Wood there arose an innumerable Number of Fowls
of many Sorts, making a confus'd Screaming, and crying every one according
to his usual Note; but not one of them of any Kind that I knew: As for
the Creature I kill'd, I took it to be a Kind of a Hawk, its Colour and
Beak resembling it, but had no Talons or Claws more than common, its Flesh
was Carrion, and fit for nothing.

<P>Contented with this Discovery, I came back to my Raft, and fell to Work
to bring my Cargo on Shore, which took me up the rest of that Day, and
what to do with my self at Night I knew not, nor indeed where to rest;
for I was afraid to lie down on the Ground, not knowing but some wild Beast
might devour me, tho', as I afterwards found, there was really no Need
for those Fears.

<P>However, as well as I could, I barricaded my self round with the Chests
and Boards that I had brought on Shore, and me a Kind of a Hut for that
Night's Lodging; as for Food, I yet saw not which Way to supply my self,
except that I had seen two or three Creatures like Hares run out of the
Wood where I shot the Fowl.

<P>I now began to consider, that I might yet get a great many Things out
of the Ship, which would be useful to me, and particularly some of the
Rigging, and Sails, and such other Things as might come to Land, and I
resolv'd to make another Voyage on Board the Vessel, if possible; and as
I knew that the first Storm that blew must necessarily break her all in
Pieces, I resolv'd to set all other Things apart, 'till I got every Thing
out of the Ship that I could get; then I call'd a Council, that is to say,
in my Thoughts, whether I should take back the Raft, but this appear'd
impracticable; so I resolv'd to go as before, when the Tide was down, and
I did so, only that I stripp'd before I went from my Hut, having nothing
on but a Chequer'd Shirt, and a Pair of Linnen Drawers, and a Pair of Pumps
on my Feet.

<P>I got on Board the Ship, as before, and prepar'd a second Raft, and
having had Experience of the first, I neither made this so unwieldy, nor
loaded it so hard, but yet I brought away several Things very useful to
me; as first, in the Carpenter's Stores I found two or three Bags full
of Nails and Spikes, a great Skrew-Jack, a Dozen or two of Hatchets, and
above all, that most useful Thing call'd a Grindstone; all these I secur'd
together, with several Things belonging to the Gunner, particularly two
or three Iron Crows, and two Barrels of Musquet Bullets, seven Musquets,
and another fowling Piece, with some small Quantity of Powder more; a large
Bag full of small Shot, and a great Roll of Sheet Lead: But this last was
so heavy, I could not hoise it up to get it over the Ship's Side.

<P>Besides these Things, I took all the Mens Cloths that I could find,
and a spare Fore-top-sail, a Hammock, and some Bedding; and with this I
loaded my second Raft, and brought them all safe on Shore to my very great
Comfort.

<P>I was under some Apprehensions during my Absence from the Land, that
at least my Provisions might be devour'd on Shore; but when I came back,
I found no Sign of any Visitor, only there sat a Creature like a wild Cat
upon one of the Chests, which when I came towards it, ran away a little
Distance, and then stood still; she sat very compos'd, and unconcern'd,
and look'd full in my Face, as if she had a Mind to be acquainted with
me, I presented my Gun at her, but as she did not understand it, she was
perfectly unconcern'd at it, nor did she offer to stir away; upon which
I toss'd her a Bit of Bisket, tho' by the Way I was not very free of it,
for my Store was not great: However, I spar'd her a Bit, I Say, and she
went to it, smell'd of it, and ate it, and look'd (as pleas'd) for more,
but I thank'd her, and could spare no more; so she march'd off.

<P>Having got my second Cargo on Shore, tho' I was fain to open the Barrels
of Powder, and bring them by Parcels, for they were too heavy, being large
Casks, I went to work to make me a little Tent with the Sail and some Poles
which I cut for that Purpose, and into this Tent I brought every Thing
that I knew would spoil, either with Rain or Sun, and I piled all the empty
Chests and Casks up in a Circle round the Tent, to fortify it from any
sudden Attempt, either from Man or Beast.

<P>When I had done this I block'd up the Door of the Tent with some Boards
within, and an empty Chest set up an End without, and spreading one of
the Beds upon the Ground, laying my two Pistols just at my Head, and my
Gun at Length by me, I went to Bed for the first Time, and slept very quietly
all Night, for I was very weary and heavy, for the Night before I had slept
little, and had labour'd very hard all Day, as well to fetch all those
Things from the Ship, as to get them on Shore.

<P>I had the biggest Maggazin of all Kinds now that ever were laid up,
I believe, for one Man, but I was not satisfy'd still; for while the Ship
sat upright in that Posture, I thought I ought to get every Thing out of
her that I could; so every Day at low Water I went on Board, and brought
away some Thing or other: But particularly the third Time I went, I brought
away as much of the Rigging as I could, as also all the small Ropes and
Rope-twine I could get, with a Piece of spare Canvass, which was to mend
the Sails upon Occasion, the Barrel of wet Gun-powder: In a Word, I brought
away all the Sails first and last, only that I was fain to cut them in
Pieces, and bring as much at a Time as I could; for they were no more useful
to be Sails, but as meer Canvass only.

<P>But that which comforted me more still was, that at last of all, after
I had made five or six such Voyages as these, and thought I had nothing
more to expect from the Ship that was worth my medling with, I say, after
all this, I found a great Hogshead of Bread and three large Runlets of
Rum or Spirits, and a Box of Sugar, and a Barrel of fine Flower; this was
surprizing to me, because I had given over expecting any more Provisions,
except what was spoil'd by the Water: I soon empty'd the Hogshead of that
Bread, and wrapt it up Parcel by Parcel in Pieces of the Sails, which I
cut out; and in a Word, I got all this safe on Shore also.

<P>The next Day I made another Voyage; and now having plunder'd the Ship
of what was portable and fit to hand out, I began with the Cables; and
cutting the great Cable into Pieces, such as I could move, I got two Cables
and a Hawser on Shore, with all the Iron Work I could get; and having cut
down the Spritsail-yard, and the Missen-yard, and every Thing I could to
make a large Raft, I loaded it with all those heavy Goods, and came away:
But my good Luck began now to leave me; for this Raft was so unwieldy,
and so overloaden, that after I was enter'd the little Cove, where I had
landed the rest of my Goods, not being able to guide it so handily as I
did the other, it overset, and threw me and all my Cargo into the Water;
as for my self it was no great Harm, for I was near the Shore; but as to
my Cargo, it was great Part of it lost, especially the Iron, which I expected
would have been of great Use to me: However, when the Tide was out, I got
most of the Pieces of Cable ashore, and some of the Iron, tho' with infinite
Labour; for I was fain to dip for it into the Water, a Work which fatigu'd
me very much: After this I went every Day on Board, and brought away what
I could get.

<P>I had been now thirteen Days on Shore, and had been eleven Times on
Board the Ship; in which Time I had brought away all that one Pair of Hands
could well be suppos'd capable to bring, tho' I believe verily, had the
calm Weather held, I should have brought away the whole Ship Piece by Piece:
But preparing the 12th Time to go on Board, I found the Wind begin to rise;
however at low Water I went on Board, and tho' I thought I had rumag'd
the Cabbin so effectually, as that nothing more could be found, yet I discover'd
a Locker with Drawers in it, in one of which I found two or three Razors,
and one Pair of large Sizzers, with some ten or a Dozen of good Knives
and Forks; in another I found about Thirty six Pounds value in Money, some
<I>European</I> Coin, some <I>Brazil</I>, some Pieces of Eight, some Gold,
some Silver.

<P>I smil'd to my self at the Sight of this Money, O Drug Said I aloud,
what art thou good for, Thou art not worth to me, no not the taking off
of the Ground, one of those Knives is worth all this Heap, I have no Manner
of use for thee, e'en remain where thou art, and go to the Bottom as a
Creature whose Life is not worth saving. However, upon Second Thoughts,
I took it away, and wrapping all this in a Piece of Canvas, I began to
think of making another Raft, but while I was preparing this, I found the
Sky over-cast, and the Wind began to rise, and in a Quarter of an Hour
it blew a fresh Gale from the Shore; it presently occur'd to me, that it
was in vain to pretend to make a Raft with the Wind off Shore, and that
it was my Business to be gone before the Tide of Flood began, otherwise
I might not be able to reach the Shore at all: Accordingly I let my self
down into the Water, and swam cross the Channel, which lay between the
Ship and the Sands, and even that with Difficulty enough, partly with the
Weight of the Things I had about me, and partly the Roughness of the Water,
for the Wind rose very hastily, and before it was quite high Water, it
blew a Storm.

<P>But I was gotten home to my little Tent, where I lay with all my Wealth
about me very secure. It blew very hard all Mat Night, and in the Morning
when I look'd out, behold no more Ship was to be seen; I was a little surpriz'd,
but recover'd my self with this satisfactory Reflection, <I>viz</I>. That
I had lost no time, nor abated no Diligence to get everything out of her
that could be useful to me, and that indeed there was little left in her
that I was able to bring away if I had had more time.

<P>I now gave over any more Thoughts of the Ship, or of any thing out of
her, except what might drive on Shore from her Wreck, as indeed divers
Pieces of her afterwards did; but those things were of small use to me.

<P>My Thoughts were now wholly employ'd about securing my self against
either Savages, if any should appear, or wild Beasts, if any were in the
Island; and I had many Thoughts of the Method how to do this, and what
kind of Dwelling to make, whether I should make me a Cave in the Earth,
or a Tent upon the Earth: And, in short, I resolv'd upon both, the Manner
and Description of which, it may not be improper to give an Account of.

<P>I soon found the Place I was in was not for my Settlement, particularly
because it was upon a low moorish Ground near the Sea, and I believ'd would
not be wholesome, and more particularly because there was no fresh Water
near it, so I resolv'd to find a more healthy and more convenient Spot
of Ground.

<P>I consulted several Things in my Situation which I found would be proper
for me, 1st. Health, and fresh Water I just now mention'd, 2dly. Shelter
from the Heat of the Sun, 3dly. Security from ravenous Creatures, whether
Men or Beasts, 4thly. a View to the Sea, that if God sent any Ship in Sight,
I might not lose any Advantage for my Deliverance, of which I was not willing
to banish all my Expectation yet.

<P>In search of a Place proper for this, I found a little Plain on the
Side of a rising Hill; whose Front towards this little Plain, was steep
as a House-side, so that nothing could come down upon me from the Top;
on the Side of this Rock there was a hollow Place worn a little way in
like the Entrance or Door of a Cave, but there was not really any Cave
or Way into the Rock at all.

<P>On the Flat of the Green, just before this hollow Place, I resolv'd
to pitch my Tent: This Plain was not above an Hundred Yards broad, and
about twice as long, and lay like a Green before my Door, and at the End
of it descended irregularly every Way down into the Low-grounds by the
Sea-side. It was on the <I>N.N.W</I>. Side of the Hill, so that I was shelter'd
from the Heat every Day, till it came to a W. and by S. Sun, or thereabouts,
which in those Countries is near the Setting.

<P>Before I set up my Tent, I drew a half Circle before the hollow Place,
which took in about Ten Yards in its Semi-diameter from the Rock, and Twenty
Yards in its Diameter, from its Beginning and Ending.

<P>In this half Circle I pitch'd two Rows of strong Stakes, driving them
into the Ground till they stood very firm like Piles, the biggest End being
out of the Ground about Five Foot and a Half, and sharpen'd on the Top:
The two Rows did not stand above Six Inches from one another.

<P>Then I took the Pieces of Cable which I had cut in the Ship, and I laid
them in Rows one upon another, within the Circle, between these two Rows
of Stakes, up to the Top, placing other Stakes in the In-side, leaning
against them, about two Foot and a half high, like a Spurr to a Post, and
this Fence was so strong, that neither Man or Beast could get into it or
over it: This cost me a great deal of Time and Labour, especially to cut
the Piles in the Woods, bring them to the Place, and drive them into the
Earth.

<P>The Entrance into this Place I made to be not by a Door, but by a short
Ladder to go over the Top, which Ladder, when I was in, I lifted over after
me, and so I was compleatly fenc'd in, and fortify'd, as I thought, from
all the World, and consequently slept secure in the Night, which otherwise
I could not have done, tho', as it appear'd afterward, there was no need
of all this Caution from the Enemies that I apprehended Danger from.

<P>Into this Fence or Fortress, with infinite Labour, I carry'd all my
Riches, all my Provisions, Ammunition and Stores, of which you have the
Account above, and I made me a large Tent, which, to preserve me from the
Rains that in one Part of the Year are very violent there, I made double,
viz. One smaller Tent within, and one larger Tent above it, and cover'd
the uppermost with a large Tarpaulin which I had sav'd among the Sails.

<P>And now I lay no more for a while in the Bed which I had brought on
Shore, but in a Hammock, which was indeed a very good one, and belong'd
to the Mate of the Ship.

<P>Into this Tent I brought all my Provisions, and every thing that would
spoil by the Wet, and having thus enclos'd all my Goods, I made up the
Entrance, which till now I had left open, and so pass'd and re-pass'd,
as I said, by a short Ladder.

<P>When I had done this, I began to work my Way into the Rock, and bringing
all the Earth and Stones that I dug down out thro' my Tent, I laid 'em
up within my Fence in the Nature of a Terras, that so it rais'd the Ground
within about a Foot and a Half; and thus I made me a Cave just behind my
Tent, which serv'd me like a Cellar to my House.

<P>It cost me much Labour, and many Days, before all these Things were
brought to Perfection, and therefore I must go back to some other Things
which took up some of my Thoughts. At the same time it happen'd after I
had laid my Scheme for the setting up my Tent and making the Cave, that
a Storm of Rain falling from a thick dark Cloud, a sudden Flash of Lightning
happen'd, and after that a great Clap of Thunder, as is naturally the Effect
of it; I was not so much surpris'd with the Lightning as I was with a Thought
which darted into my Mind as swift as the Lightning it self: O my Powder!
My very Heart sunk within me, when I thought, that at one Blast all my
Powder might be destroy'd, on which, not my Defence only, but the providing
me Food, as I thought, entirely depended; I was nothing near so anxious
about my own Danger, tho' had the Powder took fire, I had never known who
had hurt me. Such Impression did this make upon me, that after the Storm
was over, I laid aside all my Works, my Building, and Fortifying, and apply'd
my self to make Bags and Boxes to separate the Powder, and keep it a little
and a little in a Parcel, in hope, that whatever might come, it might not
all take Fire at once, and to keep it so apart that it should not be possible
to make one part fire another: I finish'd this Work in about a Fortnight,
and I think my Powder, which in all was about 240 <I>l</I>. weight was
divided in not less than a Hundred Parcels; as to the Barrel that had been
wet, I did not apprehend any Danger from that, so I plac'd it in my new
Cave, which in my Fancy I call'd my Kitchin, and the rest I hid up and
down in Holes among the Rocks, so that no wet might come to it, marking
very carefully where I laid it.

<P>In the Interval of time while this was doing I went out once at least
every Day with my Gun, as well to divert my self, as to see if I could
kill any thing fit for Food, and as near as I could to acquaint my self
with what the Island produc'd. The first time I went out I presently discover'd
that there were Goats in the Island, which was a great Satisfaction to
me; but then it was attended with this Misfortune to me, <I>viz</I>. That
they were so shy, so subtile, and so swift of Foot, that it was the difficultest
thing in the World to come at them: But I was not discourag'd at this,
not doubting but I might now and then shoot one, as it soon happen'd, for
after I had found their Haunts a little, I laid wait in this Manner for
them: I observ'd if they saw me in the Valleys, tho' they were upon the
Rocks, they would run away as in a terrible Fright; but if they were feeding
in the Valleys, and I was upon the Rocks, they took no Notice of me, from
whence I concluded, that by the Position of their Opticks, their Sight
was so directed downward, that they did not readily see Objects that were
above them; so afterward I took this Method, I always clim'd the Rocks
first to get above them, and then had frequently a fair Mark. The first
shot I made among these Creatures, I kill'd a She-Goat which had a little
Kid by her which she gave Suck to, which griev'd me heartily; but when
the Old one fell, the Kid stood stock still by her till I came and took
her up, and not only so, but when I carry'd the Old one with me upon my
Shoulders, the Kid follow'd me quite to my Enclosure, upon which I laid
down the Dam, and took the Kid in my Arms, and carry'd it over my Pale,
in hopes to have bred it up tame, but it would not eat, so I was forc'd
to kill it and eat it my self; these two supply'd me with Flesh a great
while, for I eat sparingly; and sav'd my Provisions (my Bread especially)
as much as possibly I could. Having now fix'd my Habitation, I found it
absolutely necessary to provide a Place to make a Fire in, and Fewel to
burn; and what I did for that, as also how I enlarg'd my Cave, and what
Conveniences I made, I shall give a full Account of in its Place: But I
must first give some little Account of my self, and of my Thoughts about
Living, which it may well be suppos'd were not a few.

<P>I had a dismal Prospect of my Condition, for as I was not cast away
upon that Island without being driven, as is said, by a violent Storm quite
out of the Course of our intended Voyage, and a great Way, <I>viz</I>.
some Hundreds of Leagues out of the ordinary Course of the Trade of Mankind,
I had great Reason to consider it as a Determination of Heaven, that in
this desolate Place, and in this desolate Manner I should end my Life;
the Tears would run plentifully down my Face when I made these Reflections,
and sometimes I would expostulate with my self, Why Providence should thus
compleatly ruine its Creatures, and render them so absolutely miserable,
so without Help abandon'd, so entirely depress'd, that it could hardly
be rational to be thankful for such a Life.

<P>But something always return'd swift upon me to check these Thoughts,
and to reprove me; and particularly one Day walking with my Gun in my Hand
by the Sea-side, I was very pensive upon the Subject of my present Condition,
then Reason as It were expostulated with me t'other Way, thus: Well, you
are in a desolate Condition 'tis true, but pray remember, Where are the
rest of you? Did not you come Eleven of you into the Boat, where are the
Ten? Why were not they sav'd and you lost? Why were you singled out? Is
it better to be here or there? and then I pointed to the Sea. All Evills
are to be consider'd with the Good that is in them, and with what worse
attends them.

<P>Then it occurr'd to me again, how well I was furnish'd for my Subsistence,
and what would have been my Case if it had not happen'd, <I>Which was an
Hundred Thousand to one</I>, that the Ship floated from the Place where
she first struck and was driven so near to the Shore that I had time to
get all these Things out of her: What would have been my Case, if I had
been to have liv'd in the Condition in which I at first came on Shore,
without Necessaries of Life, or Necessaries to supply and procure them?
Particularly said I aloud, (tho' to my self) what should I ha' done without
a Gun, without Ammunition, without any Tools to make any thing, or to work
with, without Clothes, Bedding, a Tent, or any manner of Covering, and
that now I had all these to a Sufficient Quantity, and was in a fair way
to provide my self in such a manner, as to live without my Gun when my
Ammunition was spent; so that I had a tollerable View of subsisting without
any Want as long as I liv'd; for I consider'd from the beginning how I
would provide for the Accidents that might happen, and for the time that
was to come, even not only after my Ammunition should be spent, but even
after my Health or Strength should decay.

<P>I confess I had not entertain'd any Notion of my Ammunition being destroy'd
at one Blast, I mean my Powder being blown up by Lightning, and this made
the Thoughts of it so surprising to me when it lighten'd and thunder'd,
as I observ'd just now.

<P>And now being to enter into a melancholy Relation of a Scene of silent
Life, such perhaps as was never heard of in the World before, I shall take
it from its Beginning, and continue it in its Order. It was, by my Account,
the 30th. of <I>Sept</I>. when, in the Manner as above said, I first set
Foot upon this horrid Island, when the Sun being, to us, in its Autumnal
Equinox, was almost just over my Head, for I reckon'd my self, by Observation,
to be in the Latitude of 9 Degrees 22 Minutes North of the Line.

<P>After I had been there about Ten or Twelve Days, it came into my Thoughts,
that I should lose my Reckoning of Time for want of Books and Pen and Ink,
and should even forget the Sabbath Days from the working Days; but to prevent
this I cut it with my Knife upon a large Post, in Capital Letters, and
making it into a great Cross I set it up on the Shore where I first landed,
viz. <I>I came on Shore here on the 30th of</I> Sept. 1659. Upon the Sides
of this square Post I cut every Day a Notch with my Knife, and every seventh
Notch was as long again as the rest, and every first Day of the Month as
long again as that long one, and thus I kept my Kalander, or weekly, monthly,
and yearly reckoning of Time.

<P>In the next place we are to observe, that among the many things which
I brought out of the Ship in the several Voyages, which, as above mention'd,
I made to it, I got several things of less Value, but not all less useful
to me, which I omitted setting down before; as in particular, Pens, Ink,
and Paper, several Parcels in the Captain's, Mate's, Gunner's, and Carpenter's
keeping, three or four Compasses, some Mathematical Instruments, Dials,
Perspectives, Charts, and Books of Navigation, all which I huddel'd together,
whether I might want them or no; also I found three very good Bibles which
came to me in my Cargo from <I>England</I>, and which I had pack'd up among
my things; some Portugueze Books also, and among them two or three Popish
Prayer-Books, and several other Books, all which I carefully secur'd. And
I must not forget, that we had in the Ship a Dog and two Cats, of whose
eminent History I may have occasion to say something in its place; for
I carry'd both the Cats with me, and as for the Dog, he jump'd out of the
Ship of himself and swam on Shore to me the Day after I went on Shore with
my first Cargo, and was a trusty Servant to me many Years; I wanted nothing
that he could fetch me, nor any Company that he could make up to me, I
only wanted to have him talk to me, but that would not do: As I observ'd
before, I found Pen, Ink and Paper, and I husbanded them to the utmost,
and I shall shew, that while my Ink lasted, I kept things very exact, but
after that was gone I could not, for I could not make any Ink by any Means
that I could devise.

<P>And this put me in mind that I wanted many things, notwithstanding all
that I had amass'd together, and of these, this of Ink was one, as also
Spade, Pick-Axe, and Shovel to dig or remove the Earth, Needles, Pins,
and Thread; as for Linnen, I soon learn'd to want that without much Difficulty.
This want of Tools made every Work I did go on heavily, and it was near
a whole Year before I had entirely finish'd my little Pale or surrounded
Habitation: The Piles or Stakes, which were as heavy as I could well lift,
were a long time in cutting and preparing in the Woods, and more by far
in bringing home, so that I spent some times two Days in cutting and bringing
home one of those Posts, and a third Day in driving it into the Ground;
for which Purpose I got a heavy Piece of Wood at first, but at last bethought
my self of one of the Iron Crows, which however tho' I found it, yet it
made driving those Posts or Piles very laborious and tedious Work.

<P>But what need I ha' been concern'd at the Tediousness of any thing I
had to do, seeing I had time enough to do it in, nor had I any other Employment
if that had been over, at least, that I could foresee, except the ranging
the Island to seek for Food, which I did more or less every Day.

<P>I now began to consider seriously my Condition, and the Circumstance
I was reduc'd to, and I drew up the State of my Affairs in Writing, not
so much to leave them to any that were to come after me, for I was like
to have but few Heirs, as to deliver my Thoughts from daily poring upon
them, and afflicting my Mind; and as my Reason began now to master my Despondency,
I began to comfort my self as well as I could, and to set the good against
the Evil, that I might have something to distinguish my Case from worse,
and I stated it very impartially, like Debtor and Creditor, the Comforts
I enjoy'd, against the Miseries I suffer'd, Thus,
<BLOCKQUOTE>Evil

<P>I am cast upon a horrible desolate Island, void of all hope of Recovery.

<P>I am singl'd out and separated, as it were, from all the World to be
miserable.

<P>I am divided from Mankind, a Solitaire, one banish'd from humane Society.

<P>I have not Clothes to cover me.

<P>I am without any Defence or Means to resist any Violence of Man or Beast.

<P>I have no Soul to speak to, or relieve me.

<P>Good.

<P>But I am alive, and not drown'd as all my Ship's Company was.

<P>But I am singl'd out too from all the Ship's Crew to be spar'd from
Death; and he that miraculously sav'd me from Death, can deliver me from
this Condition.

<P>But I am in a hot Climate, where if I had Clothes I could hardly wear
them.

<P>But I am cast on an Island, where I see no wild Beasts to hurt me, as
I saw on the Coast of Africa: And what if I had been Shipwreck'd there?

<P>But God wonderfully sent the Ship in near enough to the Shore, that
I have gotten out so many necessary things as will either supply my Wants,
or enable me to supply my self even as long as I live.</BLOCKQUOTE>
Upon the whole, here was an undoubted Testimony, that there was scarce
any Condition in the World so miserable, but there was something <I>Negative</I>
or something <I>Positive</I> to be thankful for in it; and let this stand
as a Direction from the Experience of the most miserable of all Conditions
in this World, that we may always find in it something to comfort our selves
from, and to set in the Description of Good and Evil, on the Credit Side
of the Accompt.

<P>Having now brought my Mind a little to relish my Condition, and given
over looking out to Sea to see if I could spy a Ship, I say, giving over
these things, I began to apply my self to accommodate my way of Living,
and to make things as easy to me as I could.

<P>I have already describ'd my Habitation, which was a Tent under the Side
of a Rock, surrounded with a strong Pale of Posts and Cables, but I might
now rather call it a Wall, for I rais'd a kind of Wall up against it of
Turfs, about two Foot thick on the Out-side, and after some time, I think
it was a Year and Half, I rais'd Rafters from it leaning to the Rock, and
thatch'd or cover'd it with Bows of Trees, and such things as I could get
to keep out the Rain, which I found at some times of the Year very violent.

<P>I have already observ'd how I brought all my Goods into this Pale, and
into the Cave which I had made behind me: But I must observe too, that
at first this was a confus'd Heap of Goods, which as they lay in no Order,
so they took up all my Place, I had no room to turn my self; so I set my
self to enlarge my Cave and Works farther into the Earth, for it was a
loose sandy Rock, which yielded easily to the Labour I bestow'd on it;
and so when I found I was pretty safe as to Beasts of Prey, I work'd side-ways
to the Right Hand into the Rock, and then turning to the Right again, work'd
quite out and made me a Door to come out, on the Out-side of my ale or
Fortification.

<P>This gave me not only Egress and Regress, as it were a back Way to my
Tent and to my Storehouse, but gave me room to stow my Goods.

<P>And now I began to apply my self to make such necessary things as I
found I most wanted, as particularly a Chair and a Table, for without these
I was not able to enjoy the few Comforts I had in the World, I could not
write, or eat, or do several things with so much Pleasure without a Table.

<P>So I went to work; and here I must needs observe, that as Reason is
the Substance and Original of the Mathematicks, so by stating and squaring
every thing by Reason, and by making the most rational Judgment of things,
every Man may be in time Master of every mechanick Art. I had never handled
a Tool in my Life, and yet in time by Labour, Application, and Contrivance,
I found at last that I wanted nothing but I could have made it, especially
if I had had Tools; however I made abundance of things, even without Tools,
and some with no more Tools than an Adze and a Hatchet, which perhaps were
never made that way before, and that with infinite Labour: For Example,
If I wanted a Board, I had no other Way but to cut down a Tree, set it
on an Edge before me, and hew it flat on either Side with my Axe, till
I had brought it to be thin as a Plank, and then dubb it smooth with my
Adze. It is true, by this Method I could make but one Board out of a whole
Tree, but this I had no Remedy for but Patience, any more than I had for
the prodigious deal of Time and Labour which it took me up to make a Plank
or Board: But my Time or Labour was little worth, and so it was as well
employ'd one way as another.

<P>However, I made me a Table and a Chair, as I observ'd above, in the
first Place, and this I did out of the short Pieces of Boards that I brought
on my Raft from the Ship: But when I had wrought out some Boards, as above,
I made large Shelves of the Breadth of a Foot and Half one over another,
all along one Side of my Cave, to lay all my Tools, Nails, and Iron-work,
and in a Word, to separate every thing at large in their Places, that I
might come easily at them; I knock'd Pieces into the Wall of the Rock to
hang my Guns and all things that would hang up.

<P>So that had my Cave been to be seen, it look'd like a general Magazine
of all Necessary things, and I had every thing so ready at my Hand, that
it was a great Pleasure to me to see all my Goods in such Order, and especially
to find my Stock of all Necessaries so great.

<P>And now it was when I began to keep a Journal of every Day's Employment,
for indeed at first I was in too much Hurry, and not only Hurry as to Labour,
but in too much Discomposure of Mind, and my Journal would ha' been full
of many dull things: For Example, I must have said thus. <I>Sept</I>. the
30th. After I got to Shore and had escap'd drowning, instead of being thankful
to God for my Deliverance, having first vomited with the great Quantity
of salt Water which was gotten into my Stomach, and recovering my self
a little, I ran about the Shore, wringing my Hands and beating my Head
and Face, exclaiming at my Misery, and crying out, I was undone, undone,
till tyr'd and faint I was forc'd to lye down on the Ground to repose,
but durst not sleep for fear of being devour'd.

<P>Some Days after this, and after I had been on board the Ship, and got
all that I could out of her, yet I could not forbear getting up to the
Top of a little Mountain and looking out to Sea in hopes of seeing a Ship,
then fancy at a vast Distance I spy'd a Sail, please my self with the Hopes
of it, and then after looking steadily till I was almost blind, lose it
quite, and sit down and weep like a Child, and thus encrease my Misery
by my Folly.

<P>But having gotten over these things in some Measure, and having settled
my houshold Stuff and Habitation, made me a Table and a Chair, and all
as handsome about me as I could, I began to keep my Journal, of which I
shall here give you the Copy (tho' in it will be told all these Particulars
over again) as long as it lasted, for having no more Ink I was forc'd to
leave it off.
