The good, charitable gentleman encouraged them to quit the Place

for fear they should be cut off from any retreat at all by the violence

of the distemper; but whither they should go, that he found very hard

to direct them to.  At last John asked of him whether he, being a

justice of the peace, would give them certificates of health to other

justices whom they might come before; that so whatever might be

their lot, they might not be repulsed now they had been also so long

from London.  This his worship immediately granted, and gave them

proper letters of health, and from thence they were at liberty to travel

whither they pleased.



Accordingly they had a full certificate of health, intimating that they

had resided in a village in the county of Essex so long that, being

examined and scrutinised sufficiently, and having been retired from

all conversation for above forty days, without any appearance of

sickness, they were therefore certainly concluded to be sound men,

and might be safely entertained anywhere, having at last removed

rather for fear of the plague which was come into such a town, rather

than for having any signal of infection upon them, or upon any

belonging to them.



With this certificate they removed, though with great reluctance;

and John inclining not to go far from home, they moved towards the

marshes on the side of Waltham.  But here they found a man who, it

seems, kept a weir or stop upon the river, made to raise the water for

the barges which go up and down the river, and he terrified them with

dismal stories of the sickness having been spread into all the towns on

the river and near the river, on the side of Middlesex and Hertfordshire;

that is to say, into Waltham, Waltham Cross, Enfield, and Ware, and all

the towns on the road, that they were afraid to go that way; though it

seems the man imposed upon them, for that the thing was not really true.



However, it terrified them, and they resolved to move across the

forest towards Rumford and Brentwood; but they heard that there

were numbers of people fled out of London that way, who lay up and

down in the forest called Henalt Forest, reaching near Rumford, and

who, having no subsistence or habitation, not only lived oddly and

suffered great extremities in the woods and fields for want of relief,

but were said to be made so desperate by those extremities as that they

offered many violences to the county robbed and plundered, and

killed cattle, and the like; that others, building huts and hovels by the

roadside, begged, and that with an importunity next door to

demanding relief; so that the county was very uneasy, and had been

obliged to take some of them up.



This in the first place intimated to them, that they would be sure to

find the charity and kindness of the county, which they had found here

where they were before, hardened and shut up against them; and that,

on the other hand, they would be questioned wherever they came, and

would be in danger of violence from others in like cases as

themselves.



Upon all these considerations John, their captain, in all their names,

went back to their good friend and benefactor, who had relieved them

before, and laying their case truly before him, humbly asked his

advice; and he as kindly advised them to take up their old quarters

again, or if not, to remove but a little farther out of the road, and

directed them to a proper place for them; and as they really wanted

some house rather than huts to shelter them at that time of the year, it

growing on towards Michaelmas, they found an old decayed house

which had been formerly some cottage or little habitation but was so

out of repair as scarce habitable; and by the consent of a farmer to

whose farm it belonged, they got leave to make what use of it they could.



The ingenious joiner, and all the rest, by his directions went to work

with it, and in a very few days made it capable to shelter them all in

case of bad weather; and in which there was an old chimney and old

oven, though both lying in ruins; yet they made them both fit for use,

and, raising additions, sheds, and leantos on every side, they soon

made the house capable to hold them all.



They chiefly wanted boards to make window-shutters, floors, doors,

and several other things; but as the gentlemen above favoured them,

and the country was by that means made easy with them, and above

all, that they were known to be all sound and in good health,

everybody helped them with what they could spare.



Here they encamped for good and all, and resolved to remove no

more.  They saw plainly how terribly alarmed that county was

everywhere at anybody that came from London, and that they should

have no admittance anywhere but with the utmost difficulty; at least

no friendly reception and assistance as they had received here.



Now, although they received great assistance and encouragement

from the country gentlemen and from the people round about them,

yet they were put to great straits: for the weather grew cold and wet in

October and November, and they had not been used to so much

hardship; so that they got colds in their limbs, and distempers, but

never had the infection; and thus about December they came home to

the city again.



I give this story thus at large, principally to give an account what

became of the great numbers of people which immediately appeared

in the city as soon as the sickness abated; for, as I have said, great

numbers of those that were able and had retreats in the country fled to

those retreats.  So, when it was increased to such a frightful extremity

as I have related, the middling people who had not friends fled to all

parts of the country where they could get shelter, as well those that

had money to relieve themselves as those that had not.  Those that had

money always fled farthest, because they were able to subsist

themselves; but those who were empty suffered, as I have said, great

hardships, and were often driven by necessity to relieve their wants at

the expense of the country.  By that means the country was made very

uneasy at them, and sometimes took them up; though even then they

scarce knew what to do with them, and were always very backward to

punish them, but often, too, they forced them from place to place till

they were obliged to come back again to London.



I have, since my knowing this story of John and his brother, inquired

and found that there were a great many of the poor disconsolate

people, as above, fled into the country every way; and some of them

got little sheds and barns and outhouses to live in, where they could

obtain so much kindness of the country, and especially where they had

any the least satisfactory account to give of themselves, and

particularly that they did not come out of London too late.  But others,

and that in great numbers, built themselves little huts and retreats in

the fields and woods, and lived like hermits in holes and caves, or any

place they could find, and where, we may be sure, they suffered great

extremities, such that many of them were obliged to come back again

whatever the danger was; and so those little huts were often found

empty, and the country people supposed the inhabitants lay dead in

them of the plague, and would not go near them for fear - no, not in a

great while; nor is it unlikely but that some of the unhappy wanderers

might die so all alone, even sometimes for want of help, as

particularly in one tent or hut was found a man dead, and on the gate

of a field just by was cut with his knife in uneven letters the following

words, by which it may be supposed the other man escaped, or that,

one dying first, the other buried him as well as he could: -



  O mIsErY!

  We BoTH ShaLL DyE,

  WoE, WoE.





I have given an account already of what I found to have been the

case down the river among the seafaring men; how the ships lay in the

offing, as it's called, in rows or lines astern of one another, quite down

from the Pool as far as I could see.  I have been told that they lay in

the same manner quite down the river as low as Gravesend, and some

far beyond: even everywhere or in every place where they could ride

with safety as to wind and weather; nor did I ever hear that the plague

reached to any of the people on board those ships - except such as lay

up in the Pool, or as high as Deptford Reach, although the people

went frequently on shore to the country towns and villages and

farmers' houses, to buy fresh provisions, fowls, pigs, calves, and the

like for their supply.



Likewise I found that the watermen on the river above the bridge

found means to convey themselves away up the river as far as they

could go, and that they had, many of them, their whole families in

their boats, covered with tilts and bales, as they call them, and

furnished with straw within for their lodging, and that they lay thus all

along by the shore in the marshes, some of them setting up little tents

with their sails, and so lying under them on shore in the day, and

going into their boats at night; and in this manner, as I have heard, the

river-sides were lined with boats and people as long as they had

anything to subsist on, or could get anything of the country; and

indeed the country people, as well Gentlemen as others, on these and

all other occasions, were very forward to relieve them - but they were

by no means willing to receive them into their towns and houses, and

for that we cannot blame them.



There was one unhappy citizen within my knowledge who had been

visited in a dreadful manner, so that his wife and all his children were

dead, and himself and two servants only left, with an elderly woman,

a near relation, who had nursed those that were dead as well as she

could.  This disconsolate man goes to a village near the town, though

not within the bills of mortality, and finding an empty house there,

inquires out the owner, and took the house.  After a few days he got a

cart and loaded it with goods, and carries them down to the house; the

people of the village opposed his driving the cart along; but with some

arguings and some force, the men that drove the cart along got

through the street up to the door of the house.  There the constable

resisted them again, and would not let them be brought in. The man

caused the goods to be unloaden and laid at the door, and sent the cart

away; upon which they carried the man before a justice of peace; that

is to say, they commanded him to go, which he did.  The justice

ordered him to cause the cart to fetch away the goods again, which he

refused to do; upon which the justice ordered the constable to pursue

the carters and fetch them back, and make them reload the goods and

carry them away, or to set them in the stocks till they came for further

orders; and if they could not find them, nor the man would not

consent to take them away, they should cause them to be drawn with

hooks from the house-door and burned in the street.  The poor

distressed man upon this fetched the goods again, but with grievous

cries and lamentations at the hardship of his case.  But there was no

remedy; self-preservation obliged the people to those severities which

they would not otherwise have been concerned in.  Whether this poor

man lived or died I cannot tell, but it was reported that he had the

plague upon him at that time; and perhaps the people might report that

to justify their usage of him; but it was not unlikely that either he or

his goods, or both, were dangerous, when his whole family had been

dead of the distempers so little a while before.



I know that the inhabitants of the towns adjacent to London were

much blamed for cruelty to the poor people that ran from the

contagion in their distress, and many very severe things were done, as

may be seen from what has been said; but I cannot but say also that,

where there was room for charity and assistance to the people, without

apparent danger to themselves, they were

willing enough to help and relieve them.  But as every town were

indeed judges in their own case, so the poor people who ran abroad in

their extremities were often ill-used and driven back again into the

town; and this caused infinite exclamations and outcries against the

country towns, and made the clamour very popular.



And yet, more or less, maugre all the caution, there was not a town

of any note within ten (or, I believe, twenty) miles of the city but what

was more or less infected and had some died among them.  I have

heard the accounts of several, such as they were reckoned up, as follows: -



     In Enfield           32          In Uxbridge        117

     "  Hornsey           58               "  Hertford    90

     "  Newington         17          "  Ware            160

     "  Barking Abbot    200

     "  Brentford        432                       Cum aliis.





Another thing might render the country more strict with respect to

the citizens, and especially with respect to the poor, and this was what

I hinted at before: namely, that there was a seeming propensity or a

wicked inclination in those that were infected to infect others.



There have been great debates among our physicians as to the

reason of this.  Some will have it to be in the nature of the disease,

and that it impresses every one that is seized upon by it with a kind of

a rage, and a hatred against their own kind - as if there was a

malignity not only in the distemper to communicate itself, but in the

very nature of man, prompting him with evil will or

an evil eye, that, as they say in the case of a mad dog, who though the

gentlest creature before of any of his kind, yet then will fly upon and

bite any one that comes next him, and those as soon as any who had

been most observed by him before.



Others placed it to the account of the corruption of human nature,

who cannot bear to see itself more miserable than others of its own

species, and has a kind of involuntary wish that all men were as

unhappy or in as bad a condition as itself.



Others say it was only a kind of desperation, not knowing or

regarding what they did, and consequently unconcerned at the danger

or safety not only of anybody near them, but even of themselves also.

And indeed, when men are once come to a condition to abandon

themselves, and be unconcerned for the safety or at the danger of

themselves, it cannot be so much wondered that they should be

careless of the safety of other people.



But I choose to give this grave debate a quite different turn, and

answer it or resolve it all by saying that I do not grant the fact.  On the

contrary, I say that the thing is not really so, but that it was a general

complaint raised by the people inhabiting the outlying villages against

the citizens to justify, or at least excuse, those hardships and severities

so much talked of, and in which complaints both sides may be said to

have injured one another; that is to say, the citizens pressing to be

received and harboured in time of distress, and with the plague upon

them, complain of the cruelty and injustice of the country people in

being refused entrance and forced back again with their goods and

families; and the inhabitants, finding themselves so imposed upon,

and the citizens breaking in as it were upon them whether they would

or no, complain that when they were infected they were not only

regardless of others, but even willing to infect them; neither of which

were really true - that is to say, in the colours they were described in.



It is true there is something to be said for the frequent alarms which

were given to the country of the resolution of the people of London to

come out by force, not only for relief, but to plunder and rob; that they

ran about the streets with the distemper upon them without any

control; and that no care was taken to shut up houses, and confine the

sick people from infecting others; whereas, to do the Londoners

justice, they never practised such things, except in such particular

cases as I have mentioned above, and such like.  On the other hand,

everything was managed with so much care, and such excellent order

was observed in the whole city and suburbs by the care of the Lord

Mayor and aldermen and by the justices of the peace, church-wardens,

&c., in the outparts, that London may be a pattern to all the cities in

the world for the good government and the excellent order that was

everywhere kept, even in the time of the most violent infection, and

when the people were in the utmost consternation and distress.  But of

this I shall speak by itself.



One thing, it is to be observed, was owing principally to the

prudence of the magistrates, and ought to be mentioned to their

honour: viz., the moderation which they used in the great and difficult

work of shutting up of houses.  It is true, as I have mentioned, that the

shutting up of houses was a great subject of discontent, and I may say

indeed the only subject of discontent among the people at that time;

for the confining the sound in the same house with the sick was

counted very terrible, and the complaints of people so confined were

very grievous.  They were heard into the very streets, and they were

sometimes such that called for resentment, though oftener for

compassion.  They had no way to converse with any of their friends

but out at their windows, where they would make such piteous

lamentations as often moved the hearts of those they talked with, and

of others who, passing by, heard their story; and as those complaints

oftentimes reproached the severity, and sometimes the insolence, of

the watchmen placed at their doors, those watchmen would answer

saucily enough, and perhaps be apt to affront the people who were in

the street talking to the said families; for which, or for their ill-

treatment of the families, I think seven or eight of them in several

places were killed; I know not whether I should say murdered or not,

because I cannot enter into the particular cases.  It is true the

watchmen were on their duty, and acting in the post where they were

placed by a lawful authority; and killing any public legal officer in the

execution of his office is always, in the language of the law, called

murder.  But as they were not authorised by the magistrates'

instructions, or by the power they acted under, to be injurious or

abusive either to the people who were under their observation or to

any that concerned themselves for them; so when they did so, they

might he said to act themselves, not their office; ' to act as private

persons, not as persons employed; and consequently, if they brought

mischief upon themselves by such an undue behaviour, that mischief

was upon their own heads; and indeed they had so much the hearty

curses of the people, whether they deserved it or not, that whatever

befell them nobody pitied them, and everybody was apt to say they

deserved it, whatever it was.  Nor do I remember that anybody was

ever punished, at least to any considerable degree, for whatever was

done to the watchmen that guarded their houses.



What variety of stratagems were used to escape and get out of

houses thus shut up, by which the watchmen were deceived or

overpowered, and that the people got away, I have taken notice of

already, and shall say no more to that.  But I say the magistrates did

moderate and ease families upon many occasions in this case, and

particularly in that of taking away, or suffering to be removed, the

sick persons out of such houses when they were willing to be removed

either to a pest-house or other Places; and sometimes giving the well

persons in the family so shut up, leave to remove upon information

given that they were well, and that they would confine themselves in

such houses where they went so long as should be required of them.

The concern, also, of the magistrates for the supplying such poor

families as were infected - I say, supplying them with necessaries, as

well physic as food - was very great, and in which they did not content

themselves with giving the necessary orders to the officers appointed,

but the aldermen in person, and on horseback, frequently rode to such

houses and caused the people to be asked at their windows whether

they were duly attended or not; also, whether they wanted anything

that was necessary, and if the officers had constantly carried their

messages and fetched them such things as they wanted or not.  And if

they answered in the affirmative, all was well; but if they complained

that they were ill supplied, and that the officer did not do his duty, or

did not treat them civilly, they (the officers) were generally removed,

and others placed in their stead.



It is true such complaint might be unjust, and if the officer had such

arguments to use as would convince the magistrate that he was right,

and that the people had injured him, he was continued and they

reproved.  But this part could not well bear a particular inquiry, for the

parties could very ill be well heard and answered in the street from the

windows, as was the case then.  The magistrates, therefore, generally

chose to favour the people and remove the man, as what seemed to be

the least wrong and of the least ill consequence; seeing if the

watchman was injured, yet they could easily make him amends by

giving him another post of the like nature; but if the family was

injured, there was no satisfaction could be made to them, the damage

perhaps being irreparable, as it concerned their lives.



A great variety of these cases frequently happened between the

watchmen and the poor people shut up, besides those I formerly

mentioned about escaping.  Sometimes the watchmen were absent,

sometimes drunk, sometimes asleep when the people wanted them,

and such never failed to be punished severely, as indeed they

deserved.



But after all that was or could be done in these cases, the shutting up

of houses, so as to confine those that were well with those that were

sick, had very great inconveniences in it, and some that were very

tragical, and which merited to have been considered if there had been

room for it.  But it was authorised by a law, it had the public good in

view as the end chiefly aimed at, and all the private injuries that were

done by the putting it in execution must be put to the account of the

public benefit.



It is doubtful to this day whether, in the whole, it contributed

anything to the stop of the infection; and indeed I cannot say it did, for

nothing could run with greater fury and rage than the infection did

when it was in its chief violence, though the houses infected were shut

up as exactly and as effectually as it was possible.  Certain it is that if

all the infected persons were effectually shut in, no sound person

could have been infected by them, because they could not have come

near them.  But the case was this (and I shall only touch it here):

namely, that the infection was propagated insensibly, and by such

persons as were not visibly infected, who neither knew whom they

infected or who they were infected by.



A house in Whitechappel was shut up for the sake of one infected

maid, who had only spots, not the tokens come out upon her, and

recovered; yet these people obtained no liberty to stir, neither for air

or exercise, forty days.  Want of breath, fear, anger, vexation, and all

the other gifts attending such an injurious treatment cast the mistress

of the family into a fever, and visitors came into the house and said it

was the plague, though the physicians declared it was not.  However,

the family were obliged to begin their quarantine anew on the report

of the visitors or examiner, though their former quarantine wanted but

a few days of being finished.  This oppressed them so with anger and

grief, and, as before, straitened them also so much as to room, and for

want of breathing and free air, that most of the family fell sick, one of

one distemper, one of another, chiefly scorbutic ailments; only one, a

violent colic; till, after several prolongings of their confinement, some

or other of those that came in with the visitors to inspect the persons

that were ill, in hopes of releasing them, brought the distemper with

them and infected the whole house; and all or most of them died, not

of the plague as really upon them before, but of the plague that those

people brought them, who should have been careful to have protected

them from it.  And this was a thing which frequently happened, and

was indeed one of the worst consequences of shutting houses up.



I had about this time a little hardship put upon me, which I was at

first greatly afflicted at, and very much disturbed about though, as it

proved, it did not expose me to any disaster; and this was being

appointed by the alderman of Portsoken Ward one of the examiners of

the houses in the precinct where I lived.  We had a large parish, and

had no less than eighteen examiners, as the order called us; the people

called us visitors.  I endeavoured with all my might to be excused

from such an employment, and used many arguments with the

alderman's deputy to be excused; particularly I alleged that I was

against shutting up houses at all, and that it would be very hard to

oblige me to be an instrument in that which was against my

judgement, and which I did verily believe would not answer the end it

was intended for; but all the abatement I could get was only, that

whereas the officer was appointed by my Lord Mayor to continue two

months, I should be obliged to hold it but three weeks, on condition

nevertheless that I could then get some other sufficient housekeeper to

serve the rest of the time for me - which was, in short, but a very small

favour, it being very difficult to get any man to accept of such an

employment, that was fit to be entrusted with it.



It is true that shutting up of houses had one effect, which I am

sensible was of moment, namely, it confined the distempered people,

who would otherwise have been both very troublesome and very

dangerous in their running about streets with the distemper upon them

- which, when they were delirious, they would have done in a most

frightful manner, and as indeed they began to do at first very much,

till they were thus restraided; nay, so very open they were that the

poor would go about and beg at people's doors, and say they had the

plague upon them, and beg rags for their sores, or both, or anything

that delirious nature happened to think of.



A poor, unhappy gentlewoman, a substantial citizen's wife, was (if

the story be true) murdered by one of these creatures in Aldersgate

Street, or that way.  He was going along the street, raving mad to be

sure, and singing; the people only said he was drunk, but he himself

said he had the plague upon him, which it seems was true; and

meeting this gentlewoman, he would kiss her.  She was terribly

frighted, as he was only a rude fellow, and she ran from him, but the

street being very thin of people, there was nobody near enough to help

her.  When she saw he would overtake her, she turned and gave him a

thrust so forcibly, he being but weak, and pushed him down

backward.  But very unhappily, she being so near, he caught hold of

her and pulled her down also, and getting up first, mastered her and

kissed her; and which was worst of all, when he had done, told her he

had the plague, and why should not she have it as well as he?  She was

frighted enough before, being also young with child; but when she

heard him say he had the plague, she screamed out and fell down into

a swoon, or in a fit, which, though she recovered a little, yet killed her

in a very few days; and I never heard whether she had the plague or no.



Another infected person came and knocked at the door of a citizen's

house where they knew him very well; the servant let him in, and

being told the master of the house was above, he ran up and came into

the room to them as the whole family was at supper.  They began to

rise up, a little surprised, not knowing what the matter was; but he bid

them sit still, he only came to take his leave of them.  They asked him,

'Why, Mr -, where are you going?' 'Going,' says he; 'I have got the

sickness, and shall die tomorrow night.' 'Tis easy to believe, though

not to describe, the consternation they were all in.  The women and

the man's daughters, which were but little girls, were frighted almost

to death and got up, one running out at one door and one at another,

some downstairs and some upstairs, and getting together as well as

they could, locked themselves into their chambers and screamed out

at the window for help, as if they had been frighted out of their, wits.

The master, more composed than they, though both frighted and

provoked, was going to lay hands on him and throw him downstairs,

being in a passion; but then, considering a little the condition of the

man and the danger of touching him, horror seized his mind, and he

stood still like one astonished.  The poor distempered man all this

while, being as well diseased in his brain as in his body, stood still

like one amazed.  At length he turns round: 'Ay!' says he, with all the

seeming calmness imaginable, 'is it so with you all?  Are you all

disturbed at me?  Why, then I'll e'en go home and die there.' And so he

goes immediately downstairs.  The servant that had let him in goes

down after him with a candle, but was afraid to go past him and open

the door, so he stood on the stairs to see what he would do.  The man

went and opened the door, and went out and flung the door after him.

It was some while before the family recovered the fright, but as no ill

consequence attended, they have had occasion since to speak of it

(You may be sure) with great satisfaction.  Though the man was gone,

it was some time - nay, as I heard, some days before they recovered

themselves of the hurry they were in; nor did they go up and down the

house with any assurance till they had burnt a great variety of fumes

and perfumes in all the rooms, and made a great many smokes of

pitch, of gunpowder, and of sulphur, all separately shifted, and

washed their clothes, and the like.  As to the poor man, whether he

lived or died I don't remember.



It is most certain that, if by the shutting up of houses the sick bad

not been confined, multitudes who in the height of their fever were

delirious and distracted would have been continually running up and

down the streets; and even as it was a very great number did so, and

offered all sorts of violence to those they met,. even just as a mad dog

runs on and bites at every one he meets; nor can I doubt but that,

should one of those infected, diseased creatures have bitten any man

or woman while the frenzy of the distemper was upon them, they, I

mean the person so wounded, would as certainly have been incurably

infected as one that was sick before, and had the tokens upon him.



I heard of one infected creature who, running out of his bed in his

shirt in the anguish and agony of his swellings, of which he had three

upon him, got his shoes on and went to put on his coat; but the nurse

resisting, and snatching the coat from him, he threw her down, ran

over her, ran downstairs and into the street, directly to the Thames in

his shirt; the nurse running after him, and calling to the watch to stop

him; but the watchman, ftighted at the man, and afraid to touch him,

let him go on; upon which he ran down to the Stillyard stairs, threw

away his shirt, and plunged into the Thames, and, being a good

swimmer, swam quite over the river; and the tide being coming in, as

they call it (that is, running westward) he reached the land not till he

came about the Falcon stairs, where landing, and finding no people

there, it being in the night, he ran about the streets there, naked as he

was, for a good while, when, it being by that time high water, he takes

the river again, and swam back to the Stillyard, landed, ran up the

streets again to his own house, knocking at the door, went up the stairs

and into his bed again; and that this terrible experiment cured him of

the plague, that is to say, that the violent motion of his arms and legs

stretched the parts where the swellings he had upon him were, that is

to say, under his arms and his groin, and caused them to ripen and

break; and that the cold of the water abated the fever in his blood.



I have only to add that I do not relate this any more than some of the

other, as a fact within my own knowledge, so as that I can vouch the

truth of them, and especially that of the man being cured by the

extravagant adventure, which I confess I do not think very possible;

but it may serve to confirm the many desperate things which the

distressed people falling into deliriums, and what we call light-

headedness, were frequently run upon at that time, and how infinitely

more such there would have been if such people had not been

confined by the shutting up of houses; and this I take to be the best, if

not the only good thing which was performed by that severe method.



On the other hand, the complaints and the murmurings were very

bitter against the thing itself.  It would pierce the hearts of all that

came by to hear the piteous cries of those infected people, who, being

thus out of their understandings by the violence of their pain or the

heat of their blood, were either shut in or perhaps tied in their beds

and chairs, to prevent their doing themselves hurt - and who would

make a dreadful outcry at their being confined, and at their being not

permitted to die at large, as they called it, and as they would have

done before.



This running of distempered people about the streets was very

dismal, and the magistrates did their utmost to prevent it; but as it was

generally in the night and always sudden when such attempts were

made, the officers could not be at band to prevent it; and even when

any got out in the day, the officers appointed did not care to meddle

with them, because, as they were all grievously infected, to be sure,

when they were come to that height, so they were more than ordinarily

infectious, and it was one of the most dangerous things that could be

to touch them.  On the other hand, they generally ran on, not knowing

what they did, till they dropped down stark dead, or till they had

exhausted their spirits so as that they would fall and then die in

perhaps half-an-hour or an hour; and, which was most piteous to hear,

they were sure to come to themselves entirely in that half-hour or

hour, and then to make most grievous and piercing cries and

lamentations in the deep, afflicting sense of the condition they were

in.  This was much of it before the order for shutting up of houses was

strictly put in execution, for at first the watchmen were not so

vigorous and severe as they were afterward in the keeping the people

in; that is to say, before they were (I mean some of them) severely

punished for their neglect, failing in their duty, and letting people who

were under their care slip away, or conniving at their going abroad,

whether sick or well.  But after they saw the officers appointed to

examine into their conduct were resolved to have them do their duty

or be punished for the omission, they were more exact, and the people

were strictly restrained; which was a thing they took so ill and bore so

impatiently that their discontents can hardly be described.  But there

was an absolute necessity for it, that must be confessed, unless some

other measures had been timely entered upon, and it was too late for that.



Had not this particular (of the sick being restrained as above) been

our case at that time, London would have been the most dreadful

place that ever was in the world; there would, for aught I know, have

as many people died in the streets as died in their houses; for when the

distemper was at its height it generally made them raving and

delirious, and when they were so they would never be persuaded to

keep in their beds but by force; and many who were not tied threw

themselves out of windows when they found they could not get leave

to go out of their doors.



It was for want of people conversing one with another, in this time

of calamity, that it was impossible any particular person could come

at the knowledge of all the extraordinary cases that occurred in

different families; and particularly I believe it was never known to this

day how many people in their deliriums drowned themselves in the

Thames, and in the river which runs from the marshes by Hackney,

which we generally called Ware River, or Hackney River.  As to those

which were set down in the weekly bill, they were indeed few; nor

could it be known of any of those whether they drowned themselves

by accident or not.  But I believe I might reckon up more who within

the compass of my knowledge or observation really drowned

themselves in that year, than are put down in the bill of all put

together: for many of the bodies were never found who yet were

known to be lost; and the like in other methods of self-destruction.

There was also one man in or about Whitecross Street burned himself

to death in his bed; some said it was done by himself, others that it

was by the treachery of the nurse that attended him; but that he had

the plague upon him was agreed by all.



It was a merciful disposition of Providence also, and which I have

many times thought of at that time, that no fires, or no considerable

ones at least, happened in the city during that year, which, if it had

been otherwise, would have been very dreadful; and either the people

must have let them alone unquenched, or have come together in great

crowds and throngs, unconcerned at the danger of the infection, not

concerned at the houses they went into, at the goods they handled, or

at the persons or the people they came among.  But so it was, that

excepting that in Cripplegate parish, and two or three little eruptions

of fires, which were presently extinguished, there was no disaster of

that kind happened in the whole year.  They told us a story of a house

in a place called Swan Alley, passing from Goswell Street, near the

end of Old Street, into St John Street, that a family was infected there

in so terrible a manner that every one of the house died.  The last

person lay dead on the floor, and, as it is supposed, had lain herself all

along to die just before the fire; the fire, it seems, had fallen from its

place, being of wood, and had taken hold of the boards and the joists

they lay on, and burnt as far as just to the body, but had not taken hold

of the dead body (though she had little more than her shift on) and had

gone out of itself, not burning the rest of the house, though it was a

slight timber house.  How true this might be I do not determine, but

the city being to suffer severely the next year by fire, this year it felt

very little of that calamity.



Indeed, considering the deliriums which the agony threw people

into, and how I have mentioned in their madness, when they were

alone, they did many desperate things, it was very strange there were

no more disasters of that kind.



It has been frequently asked me, and I cannot say that I ever knew

how to give a direct answer to it, how it came to pass that so many

infected people appeared abroad in the streets at the same time that

the houses which were infected were so vigilantly searched, and all of

them shut up and guarded as they were.



I confess I know not what answer to give to this, unless it be this:

that in so great and populous a city as this is it was impossible to

discover every house that was infected as soon as it was so, or to shut

up all the houses that were infected; so that people had the liberty of

going about the streets, even where they Pleased, unless they were

known to belong to such-and-such infected houses.



It is true that, as several physicians told my Lord Mayor, the fury of

the contagion was such at some particular times, and people sickened

so fast and died so soon, that it was impossible, and indeed to no

purpose, to go about to inquire who was sick and who was well, or to

shut them up with such exactness as the thing required, almost every

house in a whole street being infected, and in many places every

person in some of the houses; and that which was still worse, by the

time that the houses were known to be infected, most of the persons

infected would be stone dead, and the rest run away for fear of being

shut up; so that it was to very small purpose to call them infected

houses and shut them up, the infection having ravaged and taken its

leave of the house before it was really known that the family was any

way touched.



This might be sufficient to convince any reasonable person that as it

was not in the power of the magistrates or of any human methods of

policy, to prevent the spreading the infection, so that this way of

shutting up of houses was perfectly insufficient for that end.  Indeed it

seemed to have no manner of public good in it, equal or

proportionable to the grievous burden that it was to the particular

families that were so shut up; and, as far as I was employed by the

public in directing that severity, I frequently found occasion to see

that it was incapable of answering the end. For example, as I was

desired, as a visitor or examiner, to inquire into the particulars of

several families which were infected, we scarce came to any house

where the plague had visibly appeared in the family but that some of

the family were fled and gone.  The magistrates would resent this, and

charge the examiners with being remiss in their examination or

inspection.  But by that means houses were long infected before it was

known.  Now, as I was in this dangerous office but half the appointed

time, which was two months, it was long enough to inform myself that

we were no way capable of coming at the knowledge of the true state

of any family but by inquiring at the door or of the neighbours.  As for

going into every house to search, that was a part no authority would

offer to impose on the inhabitants, or any citizen would undertake: for

it would have been exposing us to certain infection and death, and to

the ruin of our own families as well as of ourselves; nor would any

citizen of probity, and that could be depended upon, have stayed in the

town if they had been made liable to such a severity.



Seeing then that we could come at the certainty of things by no

method but that of inquiry of the neighbours or of the family, and on

that we could not justly depend, it was not possible but that the

uncertainty of this matter would remain as above.



It is true masters of families were bound by the order to give notice

to the examiner of the place wherein he lived, within two hours after

he should discover it, of any person being sick in his house (that is to

say, having signs of the infection)- but they found so many ways to

evade this and excuse their negligence that they seldom gave that

notice till they had taken measures to have every one escape out of the

house who had a mind to escape, whether they were sick or sound;

and while this was so, it is easy to see that the shutting up of houses

was no way to be depended upon as a sufficient method for putting a

stop to the infection because, as I have said elsewhere, many of those

that so went out of those infected houses had the plague really upon

them, though they might really think themselves sound.  And some of

these were the people that walked the streets till they fell down dead,

not that they were suddenly struck with the distemper as with a

bullet that killed with the stroke, but that they really had the infection

in their blood long before; only, that as it preyed secretly on the vitals,

it appeared not till it seized the heart with a mortal power, and the

patient died in a moment, as with a sudden fainting or an apoplectic fit.



I know that some even of our physicians thought for a time that

those people that so died in the streets were seized but that moment

they fell, as if they had been touched by a stroke from heaven as men

are killed by a flash of lightning - but they found reason to alter their

opinion afterward; for upon examining the bodies of such after they

were dead, they always either had tokens upon them or other evident

proofs of the distemper having been longer upon them than they had

otherwise expected.



This often was the reason that, as I have said, we that were

examiners were not able to come at the knowledge of the infection

being entered into a house till it was too late to shut it up, and

sometimes not till the people that were left were all dead.  In Petticoat

Lane two houses together were infected, and several people sick; but

the distemper was so well concealed, the examiner, who was my

neighbour, got no knowledge of it till notice was sent him that the

people were all dead, and that the carts should call there to fetch them

away.  The two heads of the families concerted their measures, and so

ordered their matters as that when the examiner was in the

neighbourhood they appeared generally at a time, and answered, that

is, lied, for one another, or got some of the neighbourhood to say they

were all in health - and perhaps knew no better - till, death making it

impossible to keep it any longer as a secret, the dead-carts were called

in the night to both the houses t and so it became public.  But when

the examiner ordered the constable to shut up the houses there was

nobody left in them but three people, two in one house and one in the

other, just dying, and a nurse in each house who acknowledged that

they had buried five before, that the houses had been infected nine or

ten days, and that for all the rest of the two families, which were

many, they were gone, some sick, some well, or whether sick or well

could not be known.



In like manner, at another house in the same lane, a man having his

family infected but very unwilling to be shut up, when he could

conceal it no longer, shut up himself; that is to say, he set the great red

cross upon his door with the words, 'Lord have mercy upon us', and so

deluded the examiner, who supposed it had been done by the

constable by order of the other examiner, for there were two

examiners to every district or precinct.  By this means he had free

egress and regress into his house again. and out of it, as he pleased,

notwithstanding it was infected, till at length his stratagem was found

out; and then he, with the sound part of his servants and family, made

off and escaped, so they were not shut up at all.



These things made it very hard, if not impossible, as I have said, to

prevent the spreading of an infection by the shutting up of houses -

unless the people would think the shutting of their houses no

grievance, and be so willing to have it done as that they would give

notice duly and faithfully to the magistrates of their being infected as

soon as it was known by themselves; but as that cannot be expected

from them, and the examiners cannot be supposed, as above, to go

into their houses to visit and search, all the good of shutting up houses

will be defeated, and few houses will be shut up in time, except those

of the poor, who cannot conceal it, and of some people who will be

discovered by the terror and consternation which the things put them into.



I got myself discharged of the dangerous office I was in as soon as I

could get another admitted, whom I had obtained for a little money to

accept of it; and so, instead of serving the two months, which was

directed, I was not above three weeks in it; and a great while too,

considering it was in the month of August, at which time the

distemper began to rage with great violence at our end of the town.



In the execution of this office I could not refrain speaking my

opinion among my neighbours as to this shutting up the people in their

houses; in which we saw most evidently the severities that were used,

though grievous in themselves, had also this particular objection

against them: namely, that they did not answer the end, as I have said,

but that the distempered people went day by day about the streets; and

it was our united opinion that a method to have removed the sound

from the sick, in case of a particular house being visited, would have

been much more reasonable on many accounts, leaving nobody with

the sick persons but such as should on such occasion request to stay

and declare themselves content to be shut up with them



Our scheme for removing those that were sound from those that

were sick was only in such houses as were infected, and confining the

sick was no confinement; those that could not stir would not complain

while they were in their senses and while they had the power of

judging.  Indeed, when they came to be delirious and light-headed,

then they would cry out of the cruelty of being confined; but for the

removal of those that were well, we thought it highly reasonable and

just, for their own sakes, they should be removed from the sick, and

that for other people's safety they should keep retired for a while, to

see that they were sound, and might not infect others; and we thought

twenty or thirty days enough for this.



Now, certainly, if houses had been provided on purpose for those

that were sound to perform this demi-quarantine in, they would have

much less reason to think themselves injured in such a restraint than

in being confined with infected people in the houses where they lived.



It is here, however, to be observed that after the funerals became so

many that people could not toll the bell, mourn or weep, or wear black

for one another, as they did before; no, nor so much as make coffins

for those that died; so after a while the fury of the infection appeared

to be so increased that, in short, they shut up no houses at all.  It

seemed enough that all the remedies of that kind had been used till

they were found fruitless, and that the plague spread itself with an

irresistible fury; so that as the fire the succeeding year spread itself,

and burned with such violence that the citizens, in despair, gave over

their endeavours to extinguish it, so in the plague it came at last to

such violence that the people sat still looking at one another, and

seemed quite abandoned to despair; whole streets seemed to be

desolated, and not to be shut up only, but to be emptied of their

inhabitants; doors were left open, windows stood shattering with the

wind in empty houses for want of people to shut them.  In a word,

people began to give up themselves to their fears and to think that all

regulations and methods were in vain, and that there was nothing to be

hoped for but an universal desolation; and it was even in the height of

this general despair that it Pleased God to stay His hand, and to

slacken the fury of the contagion in such a manner as was even

surprising, like its beginning, and demonstrated it to be His own

particular hand, and that above, if not without the agency of means, as

I shall take notice of in its proper place.



But I must still speak of the plague as in its height, raging even to

desolation, and the people under the most dreadful consternation,

even, as I have said, to despair.  It is hardly credible to what excess

the passions of men carried them in this extremity of the distemper,

and this part, I think, was as moving as the rest.  What could affect a

man in his full power of reflection, and what could make deeper

impressions on the soul, than to see a man almost naked, and got out

of his house, or perhaps out of his bed, into the street, come out of

Harrow Alley, a populous conjunction or collection of alleys, courts,

and passages in the Butcher Row in Whitechappel, - I say, what could

be more affecting than to see this poor man come out into the open

street, run dancing and singing and making a thousand antic gestures,

with five or six women and children running after him, crying and

calling upon him for the Lord's sake to come back, and entreating the

help of others to bring him back, but all in vain, nobody daring to lay

a hand upon him or to come near him?



This was a most grievous and afflicting thing to me, who saw it all

from my own windows; for all this while the poor afflicted man was,

as I observed it, even then in the utmost agony of pain, having (as they

said) two swellings upon him which could not be brought to break or

to suppurate; but, by laying strong caustics on them, the surgeons had,

it seems, hopes to break them - which caustics were then upon him,

burning his flesh as with a hot iron.  I cannot say what became of this

poor man, but I think he continued roving about in that manner till he

fell down and died.



No wonder the aspect of the city itself was frightful.  The usual

concourse of people in the streets, and which used to be supplied from

our end of the town, was abated.  The Exchange was not kept shut,

indeed, but it was no more frequented.  The fires were lost; they had

been almost extinguished for some days by a very smart and hasty

rain.  But that was not all; some of the physicians insisted that they

were not only no benefit, but injurious to the health of people.  This

they made a loud clamour about, and complained to the Lord Mayor

about it.  On the other hand, others of the same faculty, and eminent

too, opposed them, and gave their reasons why the fires were, and

must be, useful to assuage the violence of the distemper.  I cannot

give a full account of their arguments on both sides; only this I

remember, that they cavilled very much with one another.  Some were

for fires, but that they must be made of wood and not coal, and of

particular sorts of wood too, such as fir in particular, or cedar, because

of the strong effluvia of turpentine; others were for coal and not wood,

because of the sulphur and bitumen; and others were for neither one

or other.  Upon the whole, the Lord Mayor ordered no more fires, and

especially on this account, namely, that the plague was so fierce that

they saw evidently it defied all means, and rather seemed to increase

than decrease upon any application to check and abate it; and yet this

amazement of the magistrates proceeded rather from want of being

able to apply any means successfully than from any unwillingness

either to expose themselves or undertake the care and weight of

business; for, to do them justice, they neither spared their pains nor

their persons.  But nothing answered; the infection raged, and the

people were now frighted and terrified to the last degree: so that, as I

may say, they gave themselves up, and, as I mentioned above,

abandoned themselves to their despair.



But let me observe here that, when I say the people abandoned

themselves to despair, I do not mean to what men call a religious

despair, or a despair of their eternal state, but I mean a despair of their

being able to escape the infection or to outlive the plague. which they

saw was so raging and so irresistible in its force that indeed few

people that were touched with it in its height, about August and

September, escaped; and, which is very particular, contrary to its

ordinary operation in June and July, and the beginning of August,

when, as I have observed, many were infected, and continued so many

days, and then went off after having had the poison in their blood a

long time; but now, on the contrary, most of the people who were

taken during the two last weeks in August and in the three first weeks

in September, generally died in two or three days at furthest, and

many the very same day they were taken; whether the dog-days, or, as

our astrologers pretended to express themselves, the influence of the

dog-star, had that malignant effect, or all those who had the seeds of

infection before in them brought it up to a maturity at that time

altogether, I know not; but this was the time when it was reported that

above 3000 people died in one night; and they that would have us

believe they more critically observed it pretend to say that they all

died within the space of two hours, viz., between the hours of one and

three in the morning.



As to the suddenness of people's dying at this time, more than

before, there were innumerable instances of it, and I could name

several in my neighbourhood.  One family without the Bars, and not

far from me, were all seemingly well on the Monday, being ten in

family.  That evening one maid and one apprentice were taken ill and

died the next morning - when the other apprentice and two children

were touched, whereof one died the same evening, and the other two

on Wednesday.  In a word, by Saturday at noon the master, mistress,

four children, and four servants were all gone, and the house left

entirely empty, except an ancient woman who came in to take charge

of the goods for the master of the family's brother, who lived not far

off, and who had not been sick.



Many houses were then left desolate, all the people being carried

away dead, and especially in an alley farther on the same side beyond

the Bars, going in at the sign of Moses and Aaron, there were several

houses together which, they said, had not one person left alive in

them; and some that died last in several of those houses were left a

little too long before they were fetched out to be buried; the reason of

which was not, as some have written very untruly, that the living were

not sufficient to bury the dead, but that the mortality was so great in

the yard or alley that there was nobody left to give notice to the

buriers or sextons that there were any dead bodies there to be buried.

It was said, how true I know not, that some of those bodies were so

much corrupted and so rotten that it was with difficulty they were

carried; and as the carts could not come any nearer than to the Alley

Gate in the High Street, it was so much the more difficult to bring

them along; but I am not certain how many bodies were then left.  I

am sure that ordinarily it was not so.



As I have mentioned how the people were brought into a condition

to despair of life and abandon themselves, so this very thing had a

strange effect among us for three or four weeks; that is, it made them

bold and venturous: they were no more shy of one another, or

restrained within doors, but went anywhere and everywhere, and

began to converse.  One would say to another, 'I do not ask you how

you are, or say how I am; it is certain we shall all go; so 'tis no matter

who is all sick or who is sound'; and so they ran desperately into any

place or any company.



As it brought the people into public company, so it was surprising

how it brought them to crowd into the churches.  They inquired no

more into whom they sat near to or far from, what offensive smells

they met with, or what condition the people seemed to be in; but,

looking upon themselves all as so many dead corpses, they came to

the churches without the least caution, and crowded together as if

their lives were of no consequence compared to the work which they

came about there.  Indeed, the zeal which they showed in coming, and

the earnestness and affection they showed in their attention to what

they heard, made it manifest what a value people would all put upon

the worship of God if they thought every day they attended at the

church that it would be their last.



Nor was it without other strange effects, for it took away, all manner

of prejudice at or scruple about the person whom they found in the

pulpit when they came to the churches.  It cannot be doubted but that

many of the ministers of the parish churches were cut off, among

others, in so common and dreadful a calamity; and others had not

courage enough to stand it, but removed into the country as they found

means for escape.  As then some parish churches were quite vacant

and forsaken, the people made no scruple of desiring such Dissenters

as had been a few years before deprived of their livings by virtue of

the Act of Parliament called the Act of Uniformity to preach in the

churches; nor did the church ministers in that case make any difficulty

of accepting their assistance; so that many of those whom they called

silenced ministers had their mouths opened on this occasion and

preached publicly to the people.



Here we may observe and I hope it will not be amiss to take notice

of it that a near view of death would soon reconcile men of good

principles one to another, and that it is chiefly owing to our easy

situation in life and our putting these things far from us that our

breaches are fomented, ill blood continued, prejudices, breach of

charity and of Christian union, so much kept and so far carried on

among us as it is.  Another plague year would reconcile all these

differences; a dose conversing with death, or with diseases that

threaten death, would scum off the gall from our tempers, remove the

animosities among us, and bring us to see with differing eyes than

those which we looked on things with before.  As the people who had

been used to join with the Church were reconciled at this time with

the admitting the Dissenters to preach to them, so the Dissenters, who

with an uncommon prejudice had broken off from the communion of

the Church of England, were now content to come to their parish

churches and to conform to the worship which they did not approve of

before; but as the terror of the infection abated, those things all

returned again to their less desirable channel and to the course they

were in before.



I mention this but historically.  I have no mind to enter into

arguments to move either or both sides to a more charitable

compliance one with another.  I do not see that it is probable such a

discourse would be either suitable or successful; the breaches seem

rather to widen, and tend to a widening further, than to closing, and

who am I that I should think myself able to influence either one side

or other?  But this I may repeat again, that 'tis evident death will

reconcile us all; on the other side the grave we shall be all brethren

again.  In heaven, whither I hope we may come from all parties and

persuasions, we shall find neither prejudice or scruple; there we shall

be of one principle and of one opinion.  Why we cannot be content to

go hand in hand to the Place where we shall join heart and hand

without the least hesitation, and with the most complete harmony and

affection - I say, why we cannot do so here I can say nothing to,

neither shall I say anything more of it but that it remains to be lamented.



I could dwell a great while upon the calamities of this dreadful time,

and go on to describe the objects that appeared among us every day,

the dreadful extravagancies which the distraction of sick people drove

them into; how the streets began now to be fuller of frightful objects,

and families to be made even a terror to themselves.  But after I have

told you, as I have above, that one man, being tied in his bed, and

finding no other way to deliver himself, set the bed on fire with his

candle, which unhappily stood within his reach, and burnt himself in

his bed; and how another, by the insufferable torment he bore, danced

and sung naked in the streets, not knowing one ecstasy from another; I

say, after I have mentioned these things, what can be added more?

What can be said to represent the misery of these times more lively to

the reader, or to give him a more perfect idea of a complicated distress?



I must acknowledge that this time was terrible, that I was sometimes

at the end of all my resolutions, and that I had not the courage that I

had at the beginning.  As the extremity brought other people abroad, it

drove me home, and except having made my voyage down to

Blackwall and Greenwich, as I have related, which was an excursion,

I kept afterwards very much within doors, as I had for about a

fortnight before.  I have said already that I repented several times that

I had ventured to stay in town, and had not gone away with my brother

and his family, but it was too late for that now; and after I had

retreated and stayed within doors a good while before my impatience

led me abroad, then they called me, as I have said, to an ugly and

dangerous office which brought me out again; but as that was expired

while the height of the distemper lasted, I retired again, and continued

dose ten or twelve days more, during which many dismal spectacles

represented themselves in my view out of my own windows and in our

own street - as that particularly from Harrow Alley, of the poor

outrageous creature which danced and sung in his agony; and many

others there were.  Scarce a day or night passed over but some dismal

thing or other happened at the end of that Harrow Alley, which was a

place full of poor people, most of them belonging to the butchers or to

employments depending upon the butchery.



Sometimes heaps and throngs of people would burst out of the alley,

most of them women, making a dreadful clamour, mixed or

compounded of screeches, cryings, and calling one another, that we

could not conceive what to make of it.  Almost all the dead part of the

night the dead-cart stood at the end of that alley, for if it went in it

could not well turn again, and could go in but a little way.  There, I

say, it stood to receive dead bodies, and as the churchyard was but a

little way off, if it went away full it would soon be back again.  It is

impossible to describe the most horrible cries and noise the poor

people would make at their bringing the dead bodies of their children

and friends out of the cart, and by the number one would have thought

there had been none left behind, or that there were people enough for

a small city living in those places.  Several times they cried 'Murder',

sometimes 'Fire'; but it was easy to perceive it was all distraction, and

the complaints of distressed and distempered people.



I believe it was everywhere thus as that time, for the plague raged

for six or seven weeks beyond all that I have expressed, and came

even to such a height that, in the extremity, they began to break into

that excellent order of which I have spoken so much in behalf of the

magistrates; namely, that no dead bodies were seen in the street or

burials in the daytime: for there was a necessity in this extremity to

bear with its being otherwise for a little while.



One thing I cannot omit here, and indeed I thought it was extraordinary,

at least it seemed a remarkable hand of Divine justice:  viz., that all

the predictors, astrologers, fortune-tellers, and what they called

cunning-men, conjurers, and the like: calculators of nativities

and dreamers of dream, and such people, were gone and vanished;

not one of them was to be found.  I am verily persuaded that

a great number of them fell in the heat of the calamity,

having ventured to stay upon the prospect of getting great estates;

and indeed their gain was but too great for a time, through the madness

and folly of the people.  But now they were silent; many of them went

to their long home, not able to foretell their own fate or to calculate

their own nativities.  Some have been critical enough to say that

every one of them died.  I dare not affirm that; but this I must own,

that I never heard of one of them that ever appeared after the

calamity was over.



But to return to my particular observations during this dreadful part

of the visitation.  I am now come, as I have said, to the month of

September, which was the most dreadful of its kind, I believe, that

ever London saw; for, by all the accounts which I have seen of the

preceding visitations which have been in London, nothing has been

like it, the number in the weekly bill amounting to almost 40,000 from

the 22nd of August to the 26th of September, being but five weeks.

The particulars of the bills are as follows, viz. : -



From August the   22nd to the 29th             7496

"     "           29th     "    5th September  8252

"    September the 5th     "   12th            7690

"     "           12th     "   19th            8297

"     "           19th     "   26th            6460

                                              -----  

                                             38,195





This was a prodigious number of itself, but if I should add the

reasons which I have to believe that this account was deficient, and

how deficient it was, you would, with me, make no scruple to believe

that there died above ten thousand a week for all those weeks, one

week with another, and a proportion for several weeks both before

and after.  The confusion among the people, especially within the city,

at that time, was inexpressible.  The terror was so great at last that the

courage of the people appointed to carry away the dead began to fail

them; nay, several of them died, although they had the distemper

before and were recovered, and some of them dropped down when

they have been carrying the bodies even at the pit side, and just ready

to throw them in; and this confusion was greater in the city because

they had flattered themselves with hopes of escaping, and thought the

bitterness of death was past.  One cart, they told us, going up

Shoreditch was forsaken of the drivers, or being left to one man to

drive, he died in the street; and the horses going on overthrew the cart,

and left the bodies, some thrown out here, some there, in a dismal

manner.  Another cart was, it seems, found in the great pit in Finsbury

Fields, the driver being dead, or having been gone and abandoned it,

and the horses running too near it, the cart fell in and drew the horses

in also.  It was suggested that the driver was thrown in with it and that

the cart fell upon him, by reason his whip was seen to be in the pit

among the bodies; but that, I suppose, could not be certain.



In our parish of Aldgate the dead-carts were several times, as I have

heard, found standing at the churchyard gate full of dead bodies, but

neither bellman or driver or any one else with it; neither in these or

many other cases did they know what bodies they had in their cart, for

sometimes they were let down with ropes out of balconies and out of

windows, and sometimes the bearers brought them to the cart,

sometimes other people; nor, as the men themselves said, did they

trouble themselves to keep any account of the numbers.



The vigilance of the magistrates was now put to the utmost trial -

and, it must be confessed, can never be enough acknowledged on this

occasion also; whatever expense or trouble they were at, two things

were never neglected in the city or suburbs either : -





(1) Provisions were always to be had in full plenty, and the price not

much raised neither, hardly worth speaking.



(2) No dead bodies lay unburied or uncovered; and if one walked

from one end of the city to another, no funeral or sign of it was to be

seen in the daytime, except a little, as I have said above, in the three

first weeks in September.





This last article perhaps will hardly be believed when some

accounts which others have published since that shall be seen,

wherein they say that the dead lay unburied, which I am assured was

utterly false; at least, if it had been anywhere so, it must have been in

houses where the living were gone from the dead (having found

means, as I have observed, to escape) and where no notice was given

to the officers.  All which amounts to nothing at all in the case in

hand; for this I am positive in, having myself been employed a little in

the direction of that part in the parish in which I lived, and where as

great a desolation was made in proportion to the number of

inhabitants as was anywhere; I say, I am sure that there were no dead

bodies remained unburied; that is to say, none that the proper officers

knew of; none for want of people to carry them off, and buriers to put

them into the ground and cover them; and this is sufficient to the

argument; for what might lie in houses and holes, as in Moses and

Aaron Alley, is nothing; for it is most certain they were buried as soon

as they were found.  As to the first article (namely, of provisions, the

scarcity or dearness), though I have mentioned it before and shall

speak of it again, yet I must observe here: -





(1) The price of bread in particular was not much raised; for in the

beginning of the year, viz., in the first week in March, the penny

wheaten loaf was ten ounces and a half; and in the height of the

contagion it was to be had at nine ounces and a half, and never dearer,

no, not all that season.  And about the beginning of November it was

sold ten ounces and a half again; the like of which, I believe, was

never heard of in any city, under so dreadful a visitation, before.



(2) Neither was there (which I wondered much at) any want of

bakers or ovens kept open to supply the people with the bread; but this

was indeed alleged by some families, viz., that their maidservants,

going to the bakehouses with their dough to be baked, which was then

the custom, sometimes came home with the sickness (that is to say the

plague) upon them.





In all this dreadful visitation there were, as I have said before, but

two pest-houses made use of, viz., one in the fields beyond Old Street

and one in Westminster; neither was there any compulsion used in

carrying people thither.  Indeed there was no need of compulsion in

the case, for there were thousands of poor distressed people who,

having no help or conveniences or supplies but of charity, would have

been very glad to have been carried thither and been taken care of;

which, indeed, was the only thing that I think was wanting in the

whole public management of the city, seeing nobody was here

allowed to be brought to the pest-house but where money was given,

or security for money, either at their introducing or upon their being

cured and sent out - for very many were sent out again whole; and

very good physicians were appointed to those places, so that many

people did very well there, of which I shall make mention again.  The

principal sort of people sent thither were, as I have said, servants who

got the distemper by going of errands to fetch necessaries to the

families where they lived, and who in that case, if they came home

sick, were removed to preserve the rest of the house; and they were so

well looked after there in all the time of the visitation that there was

but 156 buried in all at the London pest-house, and 159 at that of

Westminster.



By having more pest-houses I am far from meaning a forcing all

people into such places.  Had the shutting up of houses been omitted

and the sick hurried out of their dwellings to pest-houses, as some

proposed, it seems, at that time as well as since, it would certainly

have been much worse than it was.  The very removing the sick would

have been a spreading of the infection, and the rather because that

removing could not effectually clear the house where the sick person

was of the distemper; and the rest of the family, being then left at

liberty, would certainly spread it among others.



The methods also in private families, which would have been

universally used to have concealed the distemper and to have

concealed the persons being sick, would have been such that the

distemper would sometimes have seized a whole family before any

visitors or examiners could have known of it.  On the other hand, the

prodigious numbers which would have been sick at a time would have

exceeded all the capacity of public pest-houses to receive them, or of

public officers to discover and remove them.



This was well considered in those days, and I have heard them talk

of it often.  The magistrates had enough to do to bring people to

submit to having their houses shut up, and many ways they deceived

the watchmen and got out, as I have observed.  But that difficulty

made it apparent that they t would have found it impracticable to have

gone the other way to work, for they could never have forced the sick

people out of their beds and out of their dwellings.  It must not have

been my Lord Mayor's officers, but an army of officers, that must have

attempted it; and tile people, on the other hand, would have been

enraged and desperate, and would have killed those that should have

offered to have meddled with them or with their children and

relations, whatever had befallen them for it; so that they would have

made the people, who, as it was, were in the most terrible distraction

imaginable, I say, they would have made them stark mad; whereas the

magistrates found it proper on several accounts to treat them with

lenity and compassion, and not with violence and terror, such as

dragging the sick out of their houses or obliging them to remove

themselves, would have been.



This leads me again to mention the time when the plague first

began; that is to say, when it became certain that it would spread over

the whole town, when, as I have said, the better sort of people first

took the alarm and began to hurry themselves out of town.  It was

true, as I observed in its place, that the throng was so great, and the

coaches, horses, waggons, and carts were so many, driving and

dragging the people away, that it looked as if all the city was running

away; and had any regulations been published that had been terrifying

at that time, especially such as would pretend to dispose of the people

otherwise than they would dispose of themselves, it would have put

both the city and suburbs into the utmost confusion.



But the magistrates wisely caused the people to be encouraged,

made very good bye-laws for the regulating the citizens, keeping good

order in the streets, and making everything as eligible as possible to

all sorts of people.



In the first place, the Lord Mayor and the sheriffs, the Court of

Aldermen, and a certain number of the Common Council men, or

their deputies, came to a resolution and published it, viz., that they

would not quit the city themselves, but that they would be always at

hand for the preserving good order in every place and for the doing

justice on all occasions; as also for the distributing the public charity

to the poor; and, in a word, for the doing the duty and discharging the

trust reposed in them by the citizens to the utmost of their power.



In pursuance of these orders, the Lord Mayor, sheriffs, &c., held

councils every day, more or less, for making such dispositions as they

found needful for preserving the civil peace; and though they used the

people with all possible gentleness and clemency, yet all manner of

presumptuous rogues such as thieves, housebreakers, plunderers of the

dead or of the sick, were duly punished, and several declarations were

continually published by the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen

against such.



Also all constables and churchwardens were enjoined to stay in the

city upon severe penalties, or to depute such able and sufficient

housekeepers as the deputy aldermen or Common Council men of the

precinct should approve, and for whom they should give security; and

also security in case of mortality that they would forthwith constitute

other constables in their stead.



These things re-established the minds of the people very much,

especially in the first of their fright, when they talked of making so

universal a flight that the city would have been in danger of being

entirely deserted of its inhabitants except the poor, and the country of

being plundered and laid waste by the multitude.  Nor were the

magistrates deficient in performing their part as boldly as they

promised it; for my Lord Mayor and the sheriffs were continually in

the streets and at places of the greatest danger, and though they did

not care for having too great a resort of people crowding about them,

yet in emergent cases they never denied the people access to them,

and heard with patience all their grievances and complaints.  My Lord

Mayor had a low gallery built

on purpose in his hall, where he stood a little removed from the crowd

when any complaint came to be heard, that he might appear with as

much safety as possible.



Likewise the proper officers, called my Lord Mayor's officers,

constantly attended in their turns, as they were in waiting; and if any

of them were sick or infected, as some of them were, others were

instantly employed to fill up and officiate in their places till it was

known whether the other should live or die.



In like manner the sheriffs and aldermen did in their several stations

and wards, where they were placed by office, and the sheriff's officers

or sergeants were appointed to receive orders from the respective

aldermen in their turn, so that justice was executed in all cases

without interruption.  In the next place, it was one of their particular

cares to see

the orders for the freedom of the markets observed, and in this part

either the Lord Mayor or one or both of the sheriffs were every

market-day on horseback to see their orders executed and to see that

the country people had all possible encouragement and freedom in

their coming to the markets and going back again, and that no

nuisances or frightful objects should be seen in the streets to terrify

them or make them unwilling to come.  Also the bakers were taken

under particular order, and the Master of the Bakers' Company was,

with his court of assistants, directed to see the order of my Lord

Mayor for their regulation put in execution, and the due assize of

bread (which was weekly appointed by my Lord Mayor) observed; and

all the bakers were obliged to keep their oven going constantly, on

pain of losing the privileges of a freeman of the city of London.



By this means bread was always to be had in plenty, and as cheap as

usual, as I said above; and provisions were never wanting in the

markets, even to such a degree that I often wondered at it, and

reproached myself with being so timorous and cautious in stirring

abroad, when the country people came freely and boldly to market, as

if there had been no manner of infection in the city, or danger of

catching it.



It. was indeed one admirable piece of conduct in the said

magistrates that the streets were kept constantly dear and free from all

manner of frightful objects, dead bodies, or any such things as were

indecent or unpleasant - unless where anybody fell down suddenly or

died in the streets, as I have said above; and these were generally

covered with some cloth or blanket, or removed into the next

churchyard till night.  All the needful works that carried terror with

them, that were both dismal and dangerous, were done in the night; if

any diseased bodies were removed, or dead bodies buried, or infected

clothes burnt, it was done in the night; and all the bodies which were

thrown into the great pits in the several churchyards or burying-

grounds, as has. been observed, were so removed in the night, and

everything was covered and closed before day.  So that in the daytime

there was not the least signal of the calamity to be seen or heard of,

except what was to be observed from the emptiness of the streets, and

sometimes from the passionate outcries and lamentations of the

people, out at their windows, and from the numbers of houses and

shops shut up.



Nor was the silence and emptiness of the streets so much in the city

as in the out-parts, except just at one particular time when, as I have

mentioned, the plague came east and spread over all the city.  It was

indeed a merciful disposition of God, that as the plague began at one

end of the town first (as has been observed at large) so it proceeded

progressively to other parts, and did not come on this way, or

eastward, till it had spent its fury in the West part of the town; and so,

as it came on one way, it abated another.  For example, it began at St

Giles's and the Westminster end of the town, and it was in its height in

all that part by about the middle of July, viz., in St Giles-in-the-Fields,

St Andrew's, Holborn, St Clement Danes, St Martin-in-the-Fields, and

in Westminster.  The latter end of July it decreased in those parishes;

and coming east, it increased prodigiously in Cripplegate, St

Sepulcher's, St James's, Clarkenwell, and St Bride's and Aldersgate.

While it was in all these parishes, the city and all the parishes of the

Southwark side of the water and all Stepney, Whitechappel, Aldgate,

Wapping, and Ratcliff, were very little touched; so that people went

about their business unconcerned, carried on their trades, kept open

their shops, and conversed freely with one another in all the city, the

east and north-east suburbs, and in Southwark, almost as if the plague

had not been among us.



Even when the north and north-west suburbs were fully infected,

viz., Cripplegate, Clarkenwell, Bishopsgate, and Shoreditch, yet still

all the rest were tolerably well.  For example from 25th July to 1st

August the bill stood thus of all diseases: -



St Giles, Cripplegate                              554

St Sepulchers                                      250

Clarkenwell                                        103

Bishopsgate                                        116

Whitechappel                                       104

All the ninety-seven parishes within the walls     228

All the parishes in Southwark                      205

     Total                                        1889







So that, in short, there died more that week in the two parishes of

Cripplegate and St Sepulcher by forty-eight than in all the city, all the

east suburbs, and all the Southwark parishes put together.  This caused

the reputation of the city's health to continue all over England - and

especially in the counties and markets adjacent, from whence our

supply of provisions chiefly came even much longer than that health

itself continued; for when the people came into the streets from the

country by Shoreditch and Bishopsgate, or by Old Street and

Smithfield, they would see the out-streets empty and the houses and

shops shut, and the few people that were stirring there walk in the

middle of the streets.  But when they came within the city, there

things looked better, and the markets and shops were open, and the

people walking about the streets as usual, though not quite so many;

and this continued till the latter end of August and the beginning of

September.



But then the case altered quite; the distemper abated in the west and

north-west parishes, and the weight of the infection lay on the city and

the eastern suburbs, and the Southwark side, and this in a frightful

manner.

Then, indeed, the city began to look dismal, shops to be shut, and the

streets desolate.  In the High Street, indeed, necessity made people stir

abroad on many occasions; and there would be in the middle of the

day a pretty many people, but in the mornings and evenings scarce any

to be seen, even there, no, not in Cornhill and Cheapside.



These observations of mine were abundantly confirmed by the

weekly bills of mortality for those weeks, an abstract of which, as they

respect the parishes which.  I have mentioned and as they make the

calculations I speak of very evident, take as

follows.



The weekly bill, which makes out this decrease of the burials in the

west and north side of the city, stands thus - -

Here is a strange change of things indeed, and a sad change it was;

and had it held for two months more than it did, very few people

would have been left alive.  But then such, I say, was the merciful

disposition of God that, when it was thus, the west and north part

which had been so dreadfully visited at first, grew, as you see, much

better; and as the people disappeared here, they began to look abroad

again there; and the next week or two altered it still more; that is,

more to the encouragement of tile other part of the town.  For

And now the misery of the city and of the said east and south parts

was complete indeed; for, as you see, the weight of the distemper lay

upon those parts, that is to say, the city, the eight parishes over the

river, with the parishes of Aldgate, Whitechappel, and Stepney; and

this was the time that the bills came up to such a monstrous height as

that I mentioned before, and that eight or nine, and, as I believe, ten or

twelve thousand a week, died; for it is my settled opinion that they

never could come at any just account of the numbers, for the reasons

which I have given already.



Nay, one of the most eminent physicians, who has since published

in Latin an account of those times, and of his observations says that in

one week there died twelve thousand people, and that particularly

there died four thousand in one night; though I do not remember that

there ever was any such particular night so remarkably fatal as that

such a number died in it.  However, all this confirms what I have said

above of the uncertainty of the bills of mortality, &c., of which I shall

say more hereafter.



And here let me take leave to enter again, though it may seem a

repetition of circumstances, into a description of the miserable

condition of the city itself, and of those parts where I lived at this

particular time.  The city and those other parts, notwithstanding the

great numbers of people that were gone into the country, was vastly

full of people; and perhaps the fuller because people had for a long

time a strong belief that the plague would not come into the city, nor

into Southwark, no, nor into Wapping or Ratcliff at all; nay, such was

the assurance of the people on that head that many removed from the

suburbs on the west and north sides, into those eastern and south sides

as for safety; and, as I verily believe, carried the plague amongst them

there perhaps sooner than they would otherwise have had it.



Here also I ought to leave a further remark for the use of posterity,

concerning the manner of people's infecting one another; namely, that

it was not the sick people only from whom the plague was

immediately received by others that were sound, but the well.  To

explain myself: by the sick people I mean those who were known to

be sick, had taken their beds, had been under cure, or had swellings

and tumours upon them, and the like; these everybody could beware

of; they were either in their beds or in such condition as could not

be concealed.



By the well I mean such as had received the contagion, and had it

really upon them, and in their blood, yet did not show the

consequences of it in their countenances: nay, even were not sensible

of it themselves, as many were not for several days.  These breathed

death in every place, and upon everybody who came near them; nay,

their very clothes retained the infection, their hands would infect the

things they touched, especially if they were warm and sweaty, and

they were generally apt to sweat too.



Now it was impossible to know these people, nor did they

sometimes, as I have said, know themselves to be infected.  These

were the people that so often dropped down and fainted in the streets;

for oftentimes they would go about the streets to the last, till on a

sudden they would sweat, grow faint, sit down at a door and die.  It is

true, finding themselves thus, they would struggle hard to get home to

their own doors, or at other times would be just able to go into their

houses and die instantly; other times they would go about till they had

the very tokens come out upon them, and yet not know it, and would

die in an hour or two after they came home, but be well as long as

they were abroad.  These were the dangerous people; these were the

people of whom the well people ought to have been afraid; but then,

on the other side, it was impossible to know them.



And this is the reason why it is impossible in a visitation to prevent

the spreading of the plague by the utmost human vigilance: viz., that it

is impossible to know the infected people from the sound, or that the

infected people should perfectly know themselves.  I knew a man who

conversed freely in London all the season of the plague in 1665, and

kept about him an antidote or cordial on purpose to take when he

thought himself in any danger, and he had such a rule to know or have

warning of the danger by as indeed I never met with before or since.

How far it may be depended on I know not.  He had a wound in his

leg, and whenever he came among any people that were not sound,

and the infection began to affect him, he said he could know it by that

signal, viz., that his wound in his leg would smart, and look pale and

white; so as soon as ever he felt it smart it was time for him to

withdraw, or to take care of himself, taking his drink, which he always

carried about him for that purpose.  Now it seems he found his wound

would smart many times when he was in company with such who

thought themselves to be sound, and who appeared so to one another;

but he would presently rise up and say publicly, 'Friends, here is

somebody in the room that has the plague', and so would immediately

break up the company.  This was indeed a faithful monitor to all

people that the plague is not to be avoided by those that converse

promiscuously in a town infected, and people have it when they know

it not, and that they likewise give it to others when they know not that

they have it themselves; and in this case shutting up the well or

removing the sick will not do it, unless they can go back and shut up

all those that the sick had conversed with, even before they knew

themselves to be sick, and none knows how far to carry that back, or

where to stop; for none knows when or where or how they may have

received the infection, or from whom.



This I take to be the reason which makes so many people talk of the

air being corrupted and infected, and that they need not be cautious of

whom they converse with, for that the contagion was in the air.  I have

seen them in strange agitations and surprises on this account.  'I have

never come near any infected body', says the disturbed person; 'I have

conversed with none but sound, healthy people, and yet I have gotten

the distemper!' 'I am sure I am struck from Heaven', says another, and

he falls to the serious part.  Again, the first goes on exclaiming, 'I have

come near no infection or any infected person; I am sure it is the air.

We draw in death when we breathe, and therefore 'tis the hand of

God; there is no withstanding it.' And this at last made many people,

being hardened to the danger, grow less concerned at it; and less

cautious towards the latter end of the time, and when it was come to

its height, than they were at first.  Then, with a kind of a Turkish

predestinarianism, they would say, if it pleased God to strike them, it

was all one whether they went abroad or stayed at home; they could

not escape it, and therefore they went boldly about, even into infected

houses and infected company; visited sick people; and, in short, lay in

the beds with their wives or relations when they were infected.  And

what was the consequence, but the same that is the consequence in

Turkey, and in those countries where they do those things - namely,

that they were infected too, and died by hundreds and thousands?



I would be far from lessening the awe of the judgements of God and

the reverence to His providence which ought always to be on our

minds on such occasions as these.  Doubtless the visitation itself is a

stroke from Heaven upon a city, or country, or nation where it falls; a

messenger of His vengeance, and a loud call to that nation or country

or city to humiliation and repentance, according to that of the prophet

Jeremiah (xviii. 7, 8): 'At what instant I shall speak concerning a

nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and

to destroy it; if that nation against whom I have pronounced turn from

their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.' Now

to prompt due impressions of the awe of God on the minds of men on

such occasions, and not to lessen them, it is that I have left those

minutes upon record.



I say, therefore, I reflect upon no man for putting the reason of those

things upon the immediate hand of God, and the appointment and

direction of His providence; nay, on the contrary, there were many

wonderful deliverances of persons from infection, and deliverances of

persons when infected, which intimate singular and remarkable

providence in the particular instances to which they refer; and I

esteem my own deliverance to be one next to miraculous, and do

record it with thankfulness.



But when I am speaking of the plague as a distemper arising from

natural causes, we must consider it as it was really propagated by

natural means; nor is it at all the less a judgement for its being under

the conduct of human causes and effects; for, as the Divine Power has

formed the whole scheme of nature and maintains nature in its course,

so the same Power thinks fit to let His own actings with men, whether

of mercy or judgement, to go on in the ordinary course of natural

causes; and He is pleased to act by those natural causes as the

ordinary means, excepting and reserving to Himself nevertheless a

power to act in a supernatural way when He sees occasion.  Now 'tis

evident that in the case of an infection there is no apparent

extraordinary occasion for supernatural operation, but the ordinary

course of things appears sufficiently armed, and made capable of all

the effects that Heaven usually directs by a contagion.  Among these

causes and effects, this of the secret conveyance of infection,

imperceptible and unavoidable, is more than sufficient to execute the

fierceness of Divine vengeance, without putting it upon supernaturals

and miracle.



The acute penetrating nature of the disease itself was such, and the

infection was received so imperceptibly, that the most exact caution

could not secure us while in the place.  But I must be allowed to

believe - and I have so many examples fresh in my memory to

convince me of it, that I think none can resist their evidence - I say, I

must be allowed to believe that no one in this whole nation ever

received the sickness or infection but who received it in the ordinary

way of infection from somebody, or the clothes or touch or stench of

somebody that was infected before.



The manner of its coming first to London proves this also, viz., by

goods brought over from Holland, and brought thither from the

Levant; the first breaking of it out in a house in Long Acre where

those goods were carried and first opened; its spreading from that

house to other houses by the visible unwary conversing with those

who were sick; and the infecting the parish officers who were

employed about the persons dead, and the like.  These are known

authorities for this great foundation point - that it went on and

proceeded from person to person and from house to house, and no

otherwise.  In the first house that was infected there died four persons.

A neighbour, hearing the mistress of the first house was sick, went to

visit her, and went home and gave the distemper to her family, and

died, and all her household.  A minister, called to pray with the first

sick person in the second house, was said to sicken immediately and

die with several more in his house.  Then the physicians began to

consider, for they did not at first dream of a general contagion.  But

the physicians being sent to inspect the bodies, they assured the

people that it was neither more or less than the plague, with all its

terrifying particulars, and that it threatened an universal infection, so

many people having already conversed with the sick or distempered,

and having, as might be supposed, received infection from them, that

it would be impossible to put a stop to it.



Here the opinion of the physicians agreed with my observation

afterwards, namely, that the danger was spreading insensibly, for the

sick could infect none but those that came within reach of the sick

person; but that one man who may have really received the infection

and knows it not, but goes abroad and about as a sound person, may

give the plague to a thousand people, and they to greater numbers in

proportion, and neither the person giving the infection or the persons

receiving it know anything of it, and perhaps not feel the effects of it

for several days after.



For example, many persons in the time of this visitation never

perceived that they were infected till they found to their unspeakable

surprise, the tokens come out upon them; after which they seldom

lived six hours; for those spots they called the tokens were really

gangrene spots, or mortified flesh in small knobs as broad as a little

silver penny, and hard as a piece of callus or horn; so that, when the

disease was come up to that length, there was nothing could follow

but certain death; and yet, as I said, they knew nothing of their being

infected, nor found themselves so much as out of order, till those

mortal marks were upon them.  But everybody must allow that they

were infected in a high degree before, And must have been so some

time, and consequently their breath, their sweat, their very clothes,

were contagious for many days before.

This occasioned a vast variety of cases which physicians would have

much more opportunity to remember than I; but some came within

the compass of my observation or hearing, of which I shall name a few.



A certain citizen who had lived safe and untouched till the month of

September, when the weight of the distemper lay more in the city than

it had done before, was mighty cheerful, and something too bold (as I

think it was) in his talk of how secure he was, how cautious he had

been, and how he had never come near any sick body.  Says another

citizen, a neighbour of his, to him one day, 'Do not be too confident,

Mr -; it is hard to say who is sick and who is well, for we see men

alive and well to outward appearance one hour, and dead the next.'

'That is true', says the first man, for he was not a man presumptuously

secure, but had escaped a long while - and men, as I said above,

especially in the city began to be over-easy upon that score.  'That is

true,' says he; 'I do not think myself secure, but I hope I have not been

in company with any person that there has been any danger in.' 'No?'

says his neighbour.  'Was not you at the Bull Head Tavern in

Gracechurch Street with Mr - the night before last?' 'Yes,' says the

first, 'I was; but there was nobody there that we had any reason to

think dangerous.' Upon which his neighbour said no more, being

unwilling to surprise him; but this made him more inquisitive, and as

his neighbour appeared backward, he was the more impatient, and in a

kind of warmth says he aloud, 'Why, he is not dead, is he?' Upon

which his neighbour still was silent, but cast up his eyes and said

something to himself; at which the first citizen turned pale, and said

no more but this, 'Then I am a dead man too', and went home

immediately and sent for a neighbouring apothecary to give him

something preventive, for he had not yet found himself ill; but the

apothecary, opening his breast, fetched a sigh, and said no more but

this, 'Look up to God'; and the man died in a few hours.



Now let any man judge from a case like this if it is possible for the

regulations of magistrates, either by shutting up the sick or removing

them, to stop an infection which spreads itself from man to man even

while they are perfectly well and insensible of its approach, and may

be so for many days.
