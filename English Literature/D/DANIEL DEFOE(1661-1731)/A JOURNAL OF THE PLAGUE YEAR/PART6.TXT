It may be proper to ask here how long it may be supposed men

might have the seeds of the contagion in them before it discovered

itself in this fatal manner, and how long they might go about

seemingly whole, and yet be contagious to all those that came near

them.  I believe the most experienced physicians cannot answer this

question directly any more than I can; and something an ordinary

observer may take notice of, which may pass their observations.  The

opinion of physicians abroad seems to be that it may lie dormant in

the spirits or in the blood-vessels a very considerable time.  Why else

do they exact a quarantine of those who came into their harbours and

ports from suspected places?  Forty days is, one would think, too long

for nature to struggle with such an enemy as this, and not conquer it or

yield to it.  But I could not think, by my own observation, that they

can be infected so as to be contagious to others above fifteen or

sixteen days at furthest; and on that score it was, that when a house

was shut up in the city and any one had died of the plague, but nobody

appeared to be ill in the family for sixteen or eighteen days after, they

were not so strict but that they would connive at their going privately

abroad; nor would people be much afraid of them afterward, but

rather think they were fortified the better, having not been vulnerable

when the enemy was in their own house; but we sometimes found it

had lain much longer concealed.



Upon the foot of all these observations I must say that though

Providence seemed to direct my conduct to be otherwise, yet it is my

opinion, and I must leave it as a prescription, viz., that the best physic

against the plague is to run away from it.  I know people encourage

themselves by saying God is able to keep us in the midst of danger,

and able to overtake us when we think ourselves out of danger; and

this kept thousands in the town whose carcases went into the great pits

by cartloads, and who, if they had fled from the danger, had, I believe,

been safe from the disaster; at least 'tis probable they had been safe.



And were this very fundamental only duly considered by the people

on any future occasion of this or the like nature, I am persuaded it

would put them upon quite different measures for managing the

people from those that they took in 1665, or than any that have been

taken abroad that I have heard of.  In a word, they would consider of

separating the people into smaller bodies, and removing them in time

farther from one another - and not let such a contagion as this, which

is indeed chiefly dangerous to collected bodies of people, find a

million of people in a body together, as was very near the case before,

and would certainly be the case if it should ever appear again.



The plague, like a great fire, if a few houses only are contiguous

where it happens, can only burn a few houses; or if it begins in a

single, or, as we call it, a lone house, can only burn that lone house

where it begins.  But if it begins in a close-built town or city and gets

a head, there its fury increases: it rages over the whole place, and

consumes all it can reach.



I could propose many schemes on the foot of which the government

of this city, if ever they should be under the apprehensions of such

another enemy (God forbid they should), might ease themselves of the

greatest part of the dangerous people that belong to them; I mean such

as the begging, starving, labouring poor, and among them chiefly

those who, in case of a siege, are called the useless mouths; who being

then prudently and to their own advantage disposed of, and the

wealthy inhabitants disposing of themselves and of their servants and

children, the city and its adjacent parts would be so effectually

evacuated that there would not be above a tenth part of its people left

together for the disease to take hold upon.  But suppose them to be a

fifth part, and that two hundred and fifty thousand people were left:

and if it did seize upon them, they would, by their living so much at

large, be much better prepared to defend themselves against the

infection, and be less liable to the effects of it than if the same number

of people lived dose together in one smaller city such as Dublin or

Amsterdam or the like.



It is true hundreds, yea, thousands of families fled away at this last

plague, but then of them, many fled too late, and not only died in their

flight, but carried the distemper with them into the countries where

they went and infected those whom they went among for safety;

which confounded the thing, and made that be a propagation of the

distemper which was the best means to prevent it; and this too is an

evidence of it, and brings me back to what I only hinted at before, but

must speak more fully to here, namely, that men went about

apparently well many days after they had the taint of the disease in

their vitals, and after their spirits were so seized as that they could

never escape it, and that all the while they did so they were dangerous

to others; I say, this proves that so it was; for such people infected the

very towns they went through, as well as the families they went

among; and it was by that means that almost all the great towns in

England had the distemper among them, more or less, and always they

would tell you such a Londoner or such a Londoner brought it down.



It must not be omitted that when I speak of those people who were

really thus dangerous, I suppose them to be utterly ignorant of their

own conditions; for if they really knew their circumstances to be such

as indeed they were, they must have been a kind of wilful murtherers

if they would have gone abroad among healthy people - and it would

have verified indeed the suggestion which I mentioned above, and

which I thought seemed untrue: viz., that the infected people were

utterly careless as to giving the infection to others, and rather forward

to do it than not; and I believe it was partly from this very thing that

they raised that suggestion, which I hope was not really true in fact.



I confess no particular case is sufficient to prove a general, but I

could name several people within the knowledge of some of their

neighbours and families yet living who showed the contrary to an

extreme.  One man, a master of a family in my neighbourhood, having

had the distemper, he thought he had it given him by a poor workman

whom he employed, and whom he went to his house to see, or went

for some work that he wanted to have finished; and he had some

apprehensions even while he was at the poor workman's door, but did

not discover it fully; but the next day it discovered itself, and he was

taken very in, upon which he immediately caused himself to be

carried into an outbuilding which he had in his yard, and where there

was a chamber over a workhouse (the man being a brazier).  Here he

lay, and here he died, and would be tended by none of his neighbours,

but by a nurse from abroad; and would not suffer his wife, nor

children, nor servants to come up into the room, lest they should be

infected - but sent them his blessing and prayers for them by the

nurse, who spoke it to them at a distance, and all this for fear of giving

them the distemper; and without which he knew, as they were kept up,

they could not have it.



And here I must observe also that the plague, as I suppose all

distempers do, operated in a different manner on differing

constitutions; some were immediately overwhelmed with it, and it

came to violent fevers, vomitings, insufferable headaches, pains in the

back, and so up to ravings and ragings with those pains; others with

swellings and tumours in the neck or groin, or armpits, which till they

could be broke put them into insufferable agonies and torment; while

others, as I have observed, were silently infected, the fever preying

upon their spirits insensibly, and they seeing little of it till they fell

into swooning, and faintings, and death without pain.

I am not physician enough to enter into the particular reasons and

manner of these differing effects of one and the same distemper, and

of its differing operation in several bodies; nor is it my business here

to record the observations which I really made, because the doctors

themselves have done that part much more effectually than I can do,

and because my opinion may in some things differ from theirs.  I am

only relating what I know, or have heard, or believe of the particular

cases, and what fell within the compass of my view, and the different

nature of the infection as it appeared in the particular cases which I

have related; but this may be added too: that though the former sort of

those cases, namely, those openly visited, were the worst for

themselves as to pain - I mean those that had such fevers, vomitings,

headaches, pains, and swellings, because they died in such a dreadful

manner - yet the latter had the worst state of the disease; for in the

former they frequently recovered, especially if the swellings broke;

but the latter was inevitable death; no cure, no hell), could be

possible, nothing could follow but death.  And it was worse also to

others, because, as above, it secretly and unperceived by others or by

themselves, communicated death to those they conversed with, the

penetrating poison insinuating itself into their blood in a manner

which it is impossible to describe, or indeed conceive.



This infecting and being infected without so much as its being

known to either person is evident from two sorts of cases which

frequently happened at that time; and there is hardly anybody living

who was in London during the infection but must have known several

of the cases of both sorts.



(1) Fathers and mothers have gone about as if they had been well,

and have believed themselves to be so, till they have insensibly

infected and been the destruction of their whole families, which they

would have been far from doing if they had the least apprehensions of

their being unsound and dangerous themselves.  A family, whose story

I have heard, was thus infected by the father; and the distemper began

to appear upon some of them even before he found it upon himself.

But searching more narrowly, it appeared he had been affected some

time; and as soon as he found that his family had been poisoned by

himself he went distracted, and would have laid violent hands upon

himself, but was kept from that by those who looked to him, and in a

few days died.



(2) The other particular is, that many people having been well to the

best of their own judgement, or by the best observation which they

could make of themselves for several days, and only finding a decay

of appetite, or a light sickness upon their stomachs; nay, some whose

appetite has been strong, and even craving, and only a light pain in

their heads, have sent for physicians to know what ailed them, and

have been found, to their great surprise, at the brink of death: the

tokens upon them, or the plague grown up to an incurable height.



It was very sad to reflect how such a person as this last mentioned

above had been a walking destroyer perhaps for a week or a fortnight

before that; how he had ruined those that he would have hazarded his

life to save, and had been breathing death upon them, even perhaps in

his tender kissing and embracings of his own children.  Yet thus

certainly it was, and often has been, and I could give many particular

cases where it has been so.  If then the blow is thus insensibly striking

- if the arrow flies thus unseen, and cannot be discovered - to what

purpose are all the schemes for shutting up or removing the sick

people?  Those schemes cannot take place but upon those that appear

to be sick, or to be infected; whereas there are among them at the

same time thousands of people who seem to be well, but are all that

while carrying death with them into all companies which they come into.



This frequently puzzled our physicians, and especially the

apothecaries and surgeons, who knew not how to discover the sick

from the sound; they all allowed that it was really so, that many

people had the plague in their very blood, and preying upon their

spirits, and were in themselves but walking putrefied carcases whose

breath was infectious and their sweat poison, and yet were as well to

look on as other people, and even knew it not themselves; I say, they

all allowed that it was really true in fact, but they knew not how to

propose a discovery.



My friend Dr Heath was of opinion that it might be known by the

smell of their breath; but then, as he said, who durst smell to that

breath for his information? since, to know it, he must draw the stench

of the plague up into his own brain, in order to distinguish the smell!

I have heard it was the opinion of others that it might be distinguished

by the party's breathing upon a piece of glass, where, the breath

condensing, there might living creatures be seen by a microscope, of

strange, monstrous, and frightful shapes, such as dragons, snakes,

serpents, and devils, horrible to behold.  But this I very much question

the truth of, and we had no microscopes at that time, as I remember,

to make the experiment with.



It was the opinion also of another learned man, that the breath of

such a person would poison and instantly kill a bird; not only a small

bird, but even a cock or hen, and that, if it did not immediately kill the

latter, it would cause them to be roupy, as they call it; particularly that

if they had laid any eggs at any time, they would be all rotten.  But

those are opinions which I never found supported by any experiments,

or heard of others that had seen it; so I leave them as I find them;

only with this remark, namely, that I think the probabilities are

very strong for them.



Some have proposed that such persons should breathe hard upon

warm water, and that they would leave an unusual scum upon it, or

upon several other things, especially such as are of a glutinous

substance and are apt to receive a scum and support it.



But from the whole I found that the nature of this contagion was

such that it was impossible to discover it at all, or to prevent its

spreading from one to another by any human skill.



Here was indeed one difficulty which I could never thoroughly get

over to this time, and which there is but one way of answering that I

know of, and it is this, viz., the first person that died of the plague was

on December 20, or thereabouts, 1664, and in or about long Acre;

whence the first person had the infection was generally said to be from

a parcel of silks imported from Holland, and first opened in that house.



But after this we heard no more of any person dying of the plague,

or of the distemper being in that place, till the 9th of February, which

was about seven weeks after, and then one more was buried out of the

same house.  Then it was hushed, and we were perfectly easy as to the

public for a great while; for there were no more entered in the weekly

bill to be dead of the plague till the 22nd of April, when there was two

more buried, not out of the same house, but out of the same street;

and, as near as I can remember, it was out of the next house to the

first.  This was nine weeks asunder, and after this we had no more till

a fortnight, and then it broke out in several streets and spread every

way.  Now the question seems to lie thus: Where lay the seeds of the

infection all this while?  How came it to stop so long, and not stop any

longer?  Either the distemper did not come immediately by contagion

from body to body, or, if it did, then a body may be capable to

continue infected without the disease discovering itself many days,

nay, weeks together; even not a quarantine of days only, but

soixantine; not only forty days, but sixty days or longer.



It is true there was, as I observed at first, and is well known to many

yet living, a very cold winter and a long frost which continued three

months; and this, the doctors say, might check the infection; but then

the learned must allow me to say that if, according to their notion, the

disease was (as I may say) only frozen up, it would like a frozen river

have returned to its usual force and current when it thawed - whereas

the principal recess of this infection, which was from February to

April, was after the frost was broken and the weather mild and warm.



But there is another way of solving all this difficulty, which I think

my own remembrance of the thing will supply; and that is, the fact is

not granted - namely, that there died none in those long intervals, viz.,

from the 20th of December to the 9th of February, and from thence to

the 22nd of April.  The weekly bills are the only evidence on the other

side, and those bills were not of credit enough, at least with me, to

support an hypothesis or determine a question of such importance as

this; for it was our received opinion at that time, and I believe upon

very good grounds, that the fraud lay in the parish officers, searchers,

and persons appointed to give account of the dead, and what diseases

they died of; and as people were very loth at first to have the

neighbours believe their houses were infected, so they gave money to

procure, or otherwise procured, the dead persons to be returned as

dying of other distempers; and this I know was practised afterwards in

many places, I believe I might say in all places where the distemper

came, as will be seen by the vast increase of the numbers placed in the

weekly bills under other articles of diseases during the time of the

infection.  For example, in the months of July and August, when the

plague was coming on to its highest pitch, it was very ordinary to have

from a thousand to twelve hundred, nay, to almost fifteen hundred a

week of other distempers.  Not that the numbers of those distempers

were really increased to such a degree, but the great number of

families and houses where really the infection was, obtained the

favour to have their dead be returned of other distempers, to prevent

the shutting up their houses.  For example: -

     "        15th            " 22nd                     1331

     "        22nd            " 29th                     1394

     "        29th            "  5th September           1264

Now it was not doubted but the greatest part of these, or a great part

of them, were dead of the plague, but the officers were prevailed with

to return them as above, and the numbers of some particular articles

of distempers discovered is as follows: -

There were several other articles which bore a proportion to these,

and which, it is easy to perceive, were increased on the same account,

as aged, consumptions, vomitings, imposthumes, gripes, and the like,

many of which were not doubted to be infected people; but as it was

of the utmost consequence to families not to be known to be infected,

if it was possible to avoid it, so they took all the measures they could

to have it not believed, and if any died in their houses, to get them

returned to the examiners, and by the searchers, as having died of

other distempers.



This, I say, will account for the long interval which, as I have said,

was between the dying of the first persons that were returned in the

bill to be dead of the plague and the time when the distemper spread

openly and could not be concealed.



Besides, the weekly bills themselves at that time evidently discover

the truth; for, while there was no mention of the plague, and no

increase after it had been mentioned, yet it was apparent that there

was an increase of those distempers which bordered nearest upon it;

for example, there were eight, twelve, seventeen of the spotted fever

in a week, when there were none, or but very few, of the plague;

whereas before, one, three, or four were the ordinary weekly numbers

of that distemper.  Likewise, as I observed before, the burials

increased weekly in that particular parish and the parishes adjacent

more than in any other parish, although there were none set down of

the plague; all which tells us, that the infection was handed on, and

the succession of the distemper really preserved, though it seemed to

us at that time to be ceased, and to come again in a manner surprising.



It might be, also, that the infection might remain in other parts of

the same parcel of goods which at first it came in, and which might

not be perhaps opened, or at least not fully, or in the clothes of the

first infected person; for I cannot think that anybody could be seized

with the contagion in a fatal and mortal degree for nine weeks

together, and support his state of health so well as even not to

discover it to themselves; yet if it were so, the argument is the

stronger in favour of what I am saying: namely, that the infection is

retained in bodies apparently well, and conveyed from them to those

they converse with, while it is known to neither the one nor the other.



Great were the confusions at that time upon this very account, and

when people began to be convinced that the infection was received in

this surprising manner from persons apparently well, they began to be

exceeding shy and jealous of every one that came near them.  Once,

on a public day, whether a Sabbath-day or not I do not remember, in

Aldgate Church, in a pew full of people, on a sudden one fancied she

smelt an ill smell.  Immediately she fancies the plague was in the pew,

whispers her notion or suspicion to the next, then rises and goes out of

the pew.  It immediately took with the next, and so to them all; and

every one of them, and of the two or three adjoining pews, got up and

went out of the church, nobody knowing what it was offended them,

or from whom.



This immediately filled everybody's mouths with one preparation or

other, such as the old woman directed, and some perhaps as

physicians directed, in order to prevent infection by the breath of

others; insomuch that if we came to go into a church when it was

anything full of people, there would be such a mixture of smells at the

entrance that it was much more strong, though perhaps not so

wholesome, than if you were going into an apothecary's or druggist's

shop.  In a word, the whole church was like a smelling-bottle; in one

corner it was all perfumes; in another, aromatics, balsamics, and

variety of drugs and herbs; in another, salts and spirits, as every one

was furnished for their own preservation.  Yet I observed that after

people were possessed, as I have said, with the belief, or rather

assurance, of the infection being thus carried on by persons apparently

in health, the churches and meeting-houses were much thinner of

people than at other times before that they used to be.  For this is to be

said of the people of London, that during the whole time of the

pestilence the churches or meetings were never wholly shut up, nor

did the people decline coming out to the public worship of God,

except only in some parishes when the violence of the distemper was

more particularly in that parish at that time, and even then no longer

than it continued to be so.



Indeed nothing was more strange than to see with what courage the

people went to the public service of God, even at that time when they

were afraid to stir out of their own houses upon any other occasion;

this, I mean, before the time of desperation, which I have mentioned

already.  This was a proof of the exceeding populousness of the city at

the time of the infection, notwithstanding the great numbers that were

gone into the country at the first alarm, and that fled out into the

forests and woods when they were further terrified with the

extraordinary increase of it.  For when we came to see the crowds and

throngs of people which appeared on the Sabbath-days at the

churches, and especially in those parts of the town where the plague

was abated, or where it was not yet come to its height, it was amazing.

But of this I shall speak again presently.  I return in the meantime to

the article of infecting one another at first, before people came to right

notions of the infection, and of infecting one another.  People were

only shy of those that were really sick, a man with a cap upon his

head, or with clothes round his neck, which was the case of those that

had swellings there.  Such was indeed frightful; but when we saw a

gentleman dressed, with his band on and his gloves in his hand, his

hat upon his head, and his hair combed, of such we bad not the least

apprehensions, and people conversed a great while freely, especially

with their neighbours and such as they knew.  But when the

physicians assured us that the danger was as well from the sound (that

is, the seemingly sound) as the sick, and that those people who

thought themselves entirely free were oftentimes the most fatal, and

that it came to be generally understood that people were sensible of it,

and of the reason of it; then, I say, they began to be jealous of

everybody, and a vast number of people locked themselves up, so as

not to come abroad into any company at all, nor suffer any that had

been abroad in promiscuous company to come into their houses, or

near them - at least not so near them as to be within the reach of their

breath or of any smell from them; and when they were obliged to

converse at a distance with strangers, they would always have

preservatives in their mouths and about their clothes to repel and keep

off the infection.



It must be acknowledged that when people began to use these

cautions they were less exposed to danger, and the infection did not

break into such houses so furiously as it did into others before; and

thousands of families were preserved (speaking with due reserve to

the direction of Divine Providence) by that means.



But it was impossible to beat anything into the heads of the poor.

They went on with the usual impetuosity of their tempers, full of

outcries and lamentations when taken, but madly careless of

themselves, foolhardy and obstinate, while they were well.  Where

they could get employment they pushed into any kind of business, the

most dangerous and the most liable to infection; and if they were

spoken to, their answer would be, 'I must trust to God for that; if I am

taken, then I am provided for, and there is an end of me', and the like.

Or thus, 'Why, what must I do?  I can't starve.  I had as good have the

plague as perish for want.  I have no work; what could I do?  I must do

this or beg.' Suppose it was burying the dead, or attending the sick, or

watching infected houses, which were all terrible hazards; but their

tale was generally the same.  It is true, necessity was a very justifiable,

warrantable plea, and nothing could be better; but their way of talk

was much the same where the necessities were not the same.  This

adventurous conduct of the poor was that which brought the plague

among them in a most furious manner; and this, joined to the distress

of their circumstances when taken, was the reason why they died so

by heaps; for I cannot say I could observe one jot of better husbandry

among them, I mean the labouring poor, while they were all well and

getting money than there was before, but as lavish, as extravagant, and

as thoughtless for tomorrow as ever; so that when they came to be

taken sick they were immediately in the utmost distress, as well for

want as for sickness, as well for lack of food as lack of health.



This misery of the poor I had many occasions to be an eyewitness

of, and sometimes also of the charitable assistance that some pious

people daily gave to such, sending them relief and supplies both of

food, physic, and other help, as they found they wanted; and indeed it

is a debt of justice due to the temper of the people of that day to take

notice here, that not only great sums, very great sums of money were

charitably sent to the Lord Mayor and aldermen for the assistance and

support of the poor distempered people, but abundance of private

people daily distributed large sums of money for their relief, and sent

people about to inquire into the condition of particular distressed and

visited families, and relieved them; nay, some pious ladies were so

transported with zeal in so good a work, and so confident in the

protection of Providence in discharge of the great duty of charity, that

they went about in person distributing alms to the poor, and even

visiting poor families, though sick and infected, in their very houses,

appointing nurses to attend those that wanted attending, and ordering

apothecaries and surgeons, the first to supply them with drugs or

plasters, and such things as they wanted; and the last to lance and

dress the swellings and tumours, where such were wanting; giving

their blessing to the poor in substantial relief to them, as well as

hearty prayers for them.



I will not undertake to say, as some do, that none of those charitable

people were suffered to fall under the calamity itself; but this I may

say, that I never knew any one of them that miscarried, which I

mention for the encouragement of others in case of the like distress;

and doubtless, if they that give to the poor lend to the Lord, and He

will repay them, those that hazard their lives to give to the poor, and

to comfort and assist the poor in such a misery as this, may hope to be

protected in the work.



Nor was this charity so extraordinary eminent only in a few, but (for

I cannot lightly quit this point) the charity of the rich, as well in the

city and suburbs as from the country, was so great that, in a word, a

prodigious number of people who must otherwise inevitably have

perished for want as well as sickness were supported and subsisted by

it; and though I could never, nor I believe any one else, come to a full

knowledge of what was so contributed, yet I do believe that, as I heard

one say that was a critical observer of that part, there was not only

many thousand pounds contributed, but many hundred thousand

pounds, to the relief of the poor of this distressed, afflicted city; nay,

one man affirmed to me that he could reckon up above one hundred

thousand pounds a week, which was distributed by the churchwardens

at the several parish vestries by the Lord Mayor and aldermen in the

several wards and precincts, and by the particular direction of the

court and of the justices respectively in the parts where they resided,

over and above the private charity distributed by pious bands in the

manner I speak of; and this continued for many weeks together.



I confess this is a very great sum; but if it be true that there was

distributed in the parish of Cripplegate only, 17,800 in one week to

the relief of the poor, as I heard reported, and which I really believe

was true, the other may not be improbable.



It was doubtless to be reckoned among the many signal good

providences which attended this great city, and of which there were

many other worth recording, - I say, this was a very remarkable one,

that it pleased God thus to move the hearts of the people in all parts of

the kingdom so cheerfully to contribute to the relief and support of the

poor at London, the good consequences of which were felt many

ways, and particularly in preserving the lives and recovering the

health of so many thousands, and keeping so many thousands of

families from perishing and starving.



And now I am talking of the merciful disposition of Providence in

this time of calamity, I cannot but mention again, though I have

spoken several times of it already on other accounts, I mean that of

the progression of the distemper; how it began at one end of the town,

and proceeded gradually and slowly from one part to another, and like

a dark cloud that passes over our heads, which, as it thickens and

overcasts the air at one end, dears up at the other end; so, while the

plague went on raging from west to east, as it went forwards east, it

abated in the west, by which means those parts of the town which

were not seized, or who were left, and where it had spent its fury,

were (as it were) spared to help and assist the other; whereas, had the

distemper spread itself over the whole city and suburbs, at once,

raging in all places alike, as it has done since in some places abroad,

the whole body of the people must have been overwhelmed, and there

would have died twenty thousand a day, as they say there did at

Naples;, nor would the people have been able to have helped or

assisted one another.



For it must be observed that where the plague was in its full force,

there indeed the people were very miserable, and the consternation

was inexpressible.  But a little before it reached even to that place, or

presently after it was gone, they were quite another sort of people; and

I cannot but acknowledge that there was too much of that common

temper of mankind to be found among us all at that time, namely, to

forget the deliverance when the danger is past.  But I shall come to

speak of that part again.



It must not be forgot here to take some notice of the state of trade

during the time of this common calamity, and this with respect to

foreign trade, as also to our home trade.



As to foreign trade, there needs little to be said.  The trading nations

of Europe were all afraid of us; no port of France, or Holland, or

Spain, or Italy would admit our ships or correspond with us; indeed

we stood on ill terms with the Dutch, and were in a furious war with

them, but though in a bad condition to fight abroad, who had such

dreadful enemies to struggle with at home.



Our merchants were accordingly at a full stop; their ships could go

nowhere - that is to say, to no place abroad; their manufactures and

merchandise - that is to say, of our growth - would not be touched

abroad.  They were as much afraid of our goods as they were of our

people; and indeed they had reason: for our woollen manufactures are

as retentive of infection as human bodies, and if packed up by persons

infected, would receive the infection and be as dangerous to touch as

a man would be that was infected; and therefore, when any English

vessel arrived in foreign countries, if they did take the goods on shore,

they always caused the bales to be opened and aired in places

appointed for that purpose.  But from London they would not suffer

them to come into port, much less to unlade their goods, upon any

terms whatever, and this strictness was especially used with them in

Spain and Italy.  In Turkey and the islands of the Arches indeed, as

they are called, as well those belonging to the Turks as to the

Venetians, they were not so very rigid.  In the first there was no

obstruction at all; and four ships which were then in the river loading

for Italy - that is, for Leghorn and Naples - being denied product, as

they call it, went on to Turkey, and were freely admitted to unlade

their cargo without any difficulty; only that when they arrived there,

some of their cargo was not fit for sale in that country; and other parts

of it being consigned to merchants at Leghorn, the captains of the

ships had no right nor any orders to dispose of the goods; so that great

inconveniences followed to the merchants.  But this was nothing but

what the necessity of affairs required, and the merchants at Leghorn

and Naples having notice given them, sent again from thence to take

care of the effects which were particularly consigned to those ports,

and to bring back in other ships such as were improper for the markets

at Smyrna and Scanderoon.



The inconveniences in Spain and Portugal were still greater, for they

would by no means suffer our ships, especially those from London, to

come into any of their ports, much less to unlade.  There was a report

that one of our ships having by stealth delivered her cargo, among

which was some bales of English cloth, cotton, kerseys, and such-like

goods, the Spaniards caused all the goods to be burned, and punished

the men with death who were concerned in carrying them on shore.

This, I believe, was in part true, though I do not affirm it; but it is not

at all unlikely, seeing the danger was really very great, the infection

being so violent in London.



I heard likewise that the plague was carried into those countries by

some of our ships, and particularly to the port of Faro in the kingdom

of Algarve, belonging to the King of Portugal, and that several persons

died of it there; but it was not confirmed.



On the other hand, though the Spaniards and Portuguese were so shy

of us, it is most certain that the plague (as has been said) keeping at

first much at that end of the town next Westminster, the

merchandising part of the town (such as the city and the water-side)

was perfectly sound till at least the beginning of July, and the ships in

the river till the beginning of August; for to the 1st of July there had

died but seven within the whole city, and but sixty within the liberties,

but one in all the parishes of Stepney, Aldgate, and Whitechappel, and

but two in the eight parishes of Southwark.  But it was the same thing

abroad, for the bad news was gone over the whole world that the city

of London was infected with the plague, and there was no inquiring

there how the infection proceeded, or at which part of the town it was

begun or was reached to.



Besides, after it began to spread it increased so fast, and the bills

grew so high all on a sudden, that it was to no purpose to lessen the

report of it, or endeavour to make the people abroad think it better

than it was; the account which the weekly bills gave in was sufficient;

and that there died two thousand to three or-four thousand a week was

sufficient to alarm the whole trading part of the world; and the

following time, being so dreadful also in the very city itself, put the

whole world, I say, upon their guard against it.



You may be sure, also, that the report of these things lost nothing in

the carriage.  The plague was itself very terrible, and the distress of

the people very great, as you may observe of what I have said.  But the

rumour was infinitely greater, and it must not be wondered that our

friends abroad (as my brother's correspondents in particular were told

there, namely, in Portugal and Italy, where he chiefly traded) [said]

that in London there died twenty thousand in a week; that the dead

bodies lay unburied by heaps; that the living were not sufficient to

bury the dead or the sound to look after the sick; that all the kingdom

was infected likewise, so that it was an universal malady such as was

never heard of in those parts of the world; and they could hardly

believe us when we gave them an account how things really were, and

how there was not above one-tenth part of the people dead; that there

was 500,000, left that lived all the time in the town; that now the

people began to walk the streets again, and those who were fled to

return, there was no miss of the usual throng of people in the streets,

except as every family might miss their relations and neighbours, and

the like.  I say they could not believe these things; and if inquiry were

now to be made in Naples, or in other cities on the coast of Italy, they

would tell you that there was a dreadful infection in London so many years ago,

in which, as above, there died twenty thousand in a week, &c., just as we have

had it reported in London that there was a plague in the city of Naples

in the year 1656, in which there died 20,000 people in a day, of which

I have had very good satisfaction that it was utterly false.



But these extravagant reports were very prejudicial to our trade, as

well as unjust and injurious in themselves, for it was a long time after

the plague was quite over before our trade could recover itself in those

parts of the world; and the Flemings and Dutch (but especially the

last) made very great advantages of it, having all the market to

themselves, and even buying our manufactures in several parts of

England where the plague was not, and carrying them to Holland and

Flanders, and from thence transporting them to Spain and to Italy as if

they had been of their own making.



But they were detected sometimes and punished: that is to say, their

goods confiscated and ships also; for if it was true that our

manufactures as well as our people were infected, and that it was

dangerous to touch or to open and receive the smell of them, then

those people ran the hazard by that clandestine trade not only of

carrying the contagion into their own country, but also of infecting the

nations to whom they traded with those goods; which, considering

how many lives might be lost in consequence of such an action, must

be a trade that no men of conscience could suffer themselves to be

concerned in.



I do not take upon me to say that any harm was done, I mean of that

kind, by those people.  But I doubt I need not make any such proviso

in the case of our own country; for either by our people of London, or

by the commerce which made their conversing with all sorts of people

in every country and of every considerable town necessary, I say, by

this means the plague was first or last spread all over the kingdom, as

well in London as in all the cities and great towns, especially in the

trading manufacturing towns and seaports; so that, first or last, all the

considerable places in England were visited more or less, and the

kingdom of Ireland in some places, but not so universally.  How it

fared with the people in Scotland I had no opportunity to inquire.



It is to be observed that while the plague continued so violent in

London, the outports, as they are called, enjoyed a very great trade,

especially to the adjacent countries and to our own plantations.  For

example, the towns of Colchester, Yarmouth, and Hun, on that side of

England, exported to Holland and Hamburg the manufactures of the

adjacent countries for several months after the trade with London was,

as it were, entirely shut up; likewise the cities of Bristol and Exeter,

with the port of Plymouth, had the like advantage to Spain, to the

Canaries, to Guinea, and to the West Indies, and particularly to

Ireland; but as the plague spread itself every way after it had been in

London to such a degree as it was in August and September, so all or

most of those cities and towns were infected first or last; and then

trade was, as it were, under a general embargo or at a full stop - as I

shall observe further when I speak of our home trade.



One thing, however, must be observed: that as to ships coming in

from abroad (as many, you may be sure, did) some who were out in all

parts of the world a considerable while before, and some who when

they went out knew nothing of an infection, or at least of one so

terrible - these came up the river boldly, and delivered their cargoes as

they were obliged to do, except just in the two months of August and

September, when the weight of the infection lying, as I may say, all

below Bridge, nobody durst appear in business for a while.  But as this

continued but for a few weeks, the homeward-bound ships, especially

such whose cargoes were not liable to spoil, came to an anchor for a

time short of the Pool,* or fresh-water part of the river, even as low as

the river Medway, where several of them ran in; and others lay at the

Nore, and in the Hope below Gravesend.  So that by the latter end of

October there was a very great fleet of homeward-bound ships to

come up, such as the like had not been known for many years.

* That part of the river where the ships lie up when they come home is

called the Pool, and takes in all the river on both sides of the water,

from the Tower to Cuckold's Point and Limehouse. [Footnote in the original.]





Two particular trades were carried on by water-carriage all the

while of the infection, and that with little or no interruption, very

much to the advantage and comfort of the poor distressed people of

the city: and those were the coasting trade for corn and

the Newcastle trade for coals.



The first of these was particularly carried on by small vessels from

the port of Hull and other places on the Humber, by which great

quantities of corn were brought in from Yorkshire and Lincolnshire.

The other part of this corn-trade was from Lynn, in Norfolk, from

Wells and Burnham, and from Yarmouth, all in the same county; and

the third branch was from the river Medway, and from Milton,

Feversham, Margate, and Sandwich, and all the other little places and

ports round the coast of Kent and Essex.



There was also a very good trade from the coast of Suffolk with

corn, butter, and cheese; these vessels kept a constant course of trade,

and without interruption came up to that market known still by the

name of Bear Key, where they supplied the city plentifully with corn

when land-carriage began to fail, and when the people began to be

sick of coming from many places in the country.



This also was much of it owing to the prudence and conduct of the

Lord Mayor, who took such care to keep the masters and seamen from

danger when they came up, causing their corn to be bought off at any

time they wanted a market (which, however, was very seldom), and

causing the corn-factors immediately to unlade and deliver the vessels

loaden with corn, that they had very little occasion to come out of

their ships or vessels, the money being always carried on board to

them and put into a pail of vinegar before it was carried.



The second trade was that of coals from Newcastle-upon-Tyne,

without which the city would have been greatly distressed; for not in

the streets only, but in private houses and families, great quantities of

coals were then burnt, even all the summer long and when the weather

was hottest, which was done by the advice of the physicians.  Some

indeed opposed it, and insisted that to keep the houses and rooms hot

was a means to propagate the temper, which was a fermentation and

heat already in the blood; that it was known to spread and increase in

hot weather and abate in cold; and therefore they alleged that all

contagious distempers are the worse for heat, because the contagion

was nourished and gained strength in hot weather, and was, as it were,

propagated in heat.



Others said they granted that heat in the climate might propagate

infection - as sultry, hot weather fills the air with vermin and

nourishes innumerable numbers and kinds of venomous creatures

which breed in our food, in the plants, and even in our bodies, by the

very stench of which infection may be propagated; also that heat in

the air, or heat of weather, as we ordinarily call it, makes bodies relax

and faint, exhausts the spirits, opens the pores, and makes us more apt

to receive infection, or any evil influence, be it from noxious

pestilential vapours or any other thing in the air; but that the heat of

fire, and especially of coal fires kept in our houses, or near us, had a

quite different operation; the heat being not of the same kind, but

quick and fierce, tending not to nourish but to consume and dissipate

all those noxious fumes which the other kind of heat rather exhaled

and stagnated than separated and burnt up.  Besides, it was alleged

that the sulphurous and nitrous particles that are often found to be in

the coal, with that bituminous substance which burns, are all assisting

to clear and purge the air, and render it wholesome and safe to breathe

in after the noxious particles, as above, are dispersed and burnt up.



The latter opinion prevailed at that time, and, as I must confess, I

think with good reason; and the experience of the citizens confirmed

it, many houses which had constant fires kept in the rooms having

never been infected at all; and I must join my experience to it, for I

found the keeping good fires kept our rooms sweet and wholesome,

and I do verily believe made our whole family so, more than would

otherwise have been.



But I return to the coals as a trade.  It was with no little difficulty

that this trade was kept open, and particularly because, as we were in an

open war with I the Dutch at that time, the Dutch capers at first took a

great many of our collier-ships, which made the rest cautious, and

made them to stay to come in fleets together.  But after some time the

capers were either afraid to take them, or their masters, the States,

were afraid they should, and forbade them, lest the plague should be

among them, which made them fare the better.



For the security of those northern traders, the coal-ships were

ordered by my Lord Mayor not to come up into the Pool above a

certain number at a time, and ordered lighters and other vessels such

as the woodmongers (that is, the wharf-keepers or coal-sellers)

furnished, to go down and take out the coals as low as Deptford and

Greenwich, and some farther down.



Others delivered great quantities of coals in particular places where

the ships could come to the shore, as at Greenwich, Blackwall, and

other places, in vast heaps, as if to be kept for sale; but were then

fetched away after the ships which brought them were gone, so that

the seamen had no communication with the river-men, nor so much as

came near one another.



Yet all this caution could not effectually prevent the distemper

getting among the colliery: that is to say among the ships, by which a

great many seamen died of it; and that which was still worse was, that

they carried it down to Ipswich and Yarmouth, to Newcastle-upon-

Tyne, and other places on the coast - where, especially at Newcastle

and at Sunderland, it carried off a great

number of people.



The making so many fires, as above, did indeed consume an unusual

quantity of coals; and that upon one or two stops of the ships coming

up, whether by contrary weather or by the interruption of enemies I do

not remember, but the price of coals was exceeding dear, even as high

as 4 a chalder; but it soon abated when the ships came in, and as

afterwards they had a freer passage, the price was very reasonable all

the rest of that year.



The public fires which were made on these occasions, as I have

calculated it, must necessarily have cost the city about 200 chalders of

coals a week, if they had continued, which was indeed a very great quantity;

but as it was thought necessary, nothing was spared.  However, as some of

the physicians cried them down, they were not kept alight above four or

five days.  The fires were ordered thus: -





One at the Custom House, one at Billingsgate, one at Queenhith,

and one at the Three Cranes; one in Blackfriars, and one at the gate of

Bridewell; one at the corner of Leadenhal Street and Gracechurch;

one at the north and one at the south gate of the Royal Exchange; one

at Guild Hall, and one at Blackwell Hall gate; one at the Lord Mayor's

door in St Helen's, one at the west entrance into St Paul's, and one at

the entrance into Bow Church.  I do not remember whether there was

any at the city gates, but one at the Bridge-foot there was, just by St

Magnus Church.



I know some have quarrelled since that at the experiment, and said

that there died the more people because of those fires; but I am

persuaded those that say so offer no evidence to prove it, neither can I

believe it on any account whatever.



It remains to give some account of the state of trade at home in

England during this dreadful time, and particularly as it relates to the

manufactures and the trade in the city.  At the first breaking out of the

infection there was, as it is easy to suppose, a very great fright among

the people, and consequently a general stop of trade, except in

provisions and necessaries of life; and even in those things, as there

was a vast number of people fled and a very great number always sick,

besides the number which died, so there could not be above two-

thirds, if above one-half, of the consumption of provisions in the city

as used to be.



It pleased God to send a very plentiful year of corn and fruit, but not

of hay or grass - by which means bread was cheap, by reason of the

plenty of corn.  Flesh was cheap, by reason of the scarcity of grass;

but butter and cheese were dear for the same reason, and hay in the

market just beyond Whitechappel Bars was sold at 4 pound per load.

But that affected not the poor.  There was a most excessive plenty

of all sorts of fruit, such as apples, pears, plums, cherries, grapes,

and they were the cheaper because of the want of people; but this

made the poor eat them to excess, and this brought them into fluxes,

griping of the guts, surfeits, and the like, which often precipitated

them into the plague.



But to come to matters of trade.  First, foreign exportation being

stopped or at least very much interrupted and rendered difficult, a

general stop of all those manufactures followed of course which were

usually brought for exportation; and though sometimes merchants

abroad were importunate for goods, yet little was sent, the passages

being so generally stopped that the English ships would not be

admitted, as is said already, into their port.



This put a stop to the manufactures that were for exportation in most

parts of England, except in some out-ports; and even that was soon

stopped, for they all had the plague in their turn.  But though this was

felt all over England, yet, what was still worse, all intercourse of trade

for home consumption of manufactures, especially those which

usually circulated through the Londoner's hands, was stopped at once,

the trade of the city being stopped.



All kinds of handicrafts in the city, &c., tradesmen and mechanics,

were, as I have said before, out of employ; and this occasioned the

putting-off and dismissing an innumerable number of journeymen and

workmen of all sorts, seeing nothing was done relating to such trades

but what might be said to be absolutely necessary.



This caused the multitude of single people in London to be

unprovided for, as also families whose living depended upon the

labour of the heads of those families; I say, this reduced them to

extreme misery; and I must confess it is for the honour of the city of

London, and will be for many ages, as long as this is to be spoken of,

that they were able to supply with charitable provision the wants of so

many thousands of those as afterwards fell sick and were distressed:

so that it may be safely averred that nobody perished for want, at least

that the magistrates had any notice given them of.



This stagnation of our manufacturing trade in the country would

have put the people there to much greater difficulties, but that the

master-workmen, clothiers and others, to the uttermost of their stocks

and strength, kept on making their goods to keep the poor at work,

believing that soon as the sickness should abate they would have a

quick demand in proportion to the decay of their trade at that time.

But as none but those masters that were rich could do thus, and that

many were poor and not able, the manufacturing trade in England

suffered greatly, and the poor were pinched all over England by the

calamity of the city of London only.



It is true that the next year made them full amends by another

terrible calamity upon the city; so that the city by one calamity

impoverished and weakened the country, and by another calamity,

even terrible too of its kind, enriched the country and made them

again amends; for an infinite quantity of household Stuff, wearing

apparel, and other things, besides whole warehouses filled with

merchandise and manufactures such as come from all parts of

England, were consumed in the fire of London the next year after this

terrible visitation.  It is incredible what a trade this made all over the

whole kingdom, to make good the want and to supply that loss; so

that, in short, all the manufacturing hands in the nation were set on

work, and were little enough for several years to supply the market

and answer the demands.  All foreign markets also were empty of our

goods by the stop which had been occasioned by the plague, and

before an open trade was allowed again; and the prodigious demand at

home falling in, joined to make a quick vent for all sort of goods; so

that there never was known such a trade all over England for the time

as was in the first seven years after the plague, and after the

fire of London.



It remains now that I should say something of the merciful part of

this terrible judgement.  The last week in September, the plague being

come to its crisis, its fury began to assuage.  I remember my friend Dr

Heath, coming to see me the week before, told me he was sure that the

violence of it would assuage in a few days; but when I saw the weekly

bill of that week, which was the highest of the whole year, being 8297

of all diseases, I upbraided him with it, and asked him what he had

made his judgement from.  His answer, however, was not so much to

seek as I thought it would have been.  'Look you,' says he, 'by the

number which are at this time sick and infected, there should have

been twenty thousand dead the last week instead of eight thousand, if

the inveterate mortal contagion had been as it was two weeks ago; for

then it ordinarily killed in two or three days, now not under eight or

ten; and then not above one in five recovered, whereas I have

observed that now not above two in five miscarry.  And, observe it

from me, the next bill will decrease, and you will see many more

people recover than used to do; for though a vast multitude are now

everywhere infected, and as many every day fall sick, yet there will

not so many die as there did, for the malignity of the distemper is

abated'; - adding that he began now to hope, nay, more than hope, that

the infection had passed its crisis and was going off; and accordingly

so it was, for the next week being, as I said, the last in September, the

bill decreased almost two thousand.



It is true the plague was still at a frightful height, and the next bill

was no less than 6460, and the next to that, 5720; but still my friend's

observation was just, and it did appear the people did recover faster

and more in number than they used to do; and indeed, if it had not

been so, what had been the condition of the city of London?  For,

according to my friend, there were not fewer than 60,000 people at

that time infected, whereof, as above, 20,477 died, and near 40,000

recovered; whereas, had it been as it was before, 50,000 of that

number would very probably have died, if not more, and 50,000 more

would have sickened; for, in a word, the whole mass of people began

to sicken, and it looked as if none would escape.



But this remark of my friend's appeared more evident in a few

weeks more, for the decrease went on, and another week in October it

decreased 1843, so that the number dead of the plague was but 2665;

and the next week it decreased 1413 more, and yet it was seen plainly

that there was abundance of people sick, nay, abundance more than

ordinary, and abundance fell sick every day but (as above) the

malignity of the disease abated.



Such is the precipitant disposition of our people (whether it is so or

not all over the world, that's none of my particular business to

inquire), but I saw it apparently here, that as upon the first fright of

the infection they shunned one another, and fled from one another's

houses and from the city with an unaccountable and, as I thought,

unnecessary fright, so now, upon this notion spreading, viz., that the

distemper was not so catching as formerly, and that if it was catched it

was not so mortal, and seeing abundance of people who really fell

sick recover again daily, they took to such a precipitant courage, and

grew so entirely regardless of themselves and of the infection, that

they made no more of the plague than of an ordinary fever, nor indeed

so much.  They not only went boldly into company with those who

had tumours and carbuncles upon them that were running, and

consequently contagious, but ate and drank with them, nay, into their

houses to visit them, and even, as I was told, into their very chambers

where they lay sick.



This I could not see rational.  My friend Dr Heath allowed, and it

was plain to experience, that the distemper was as catching as ever,

and as many fell sick, but only he alleged that so many of those that

fell sick did not die; but I think that while many did die, and that at

best the distemper itself was very terrible, the sores and swellings very

tormenting, and the danger of death not left out of the circumstances

of sickness, though not so frequent as before; all those things, together

with the exceeding tediousness of the cure, the loathsomeness of the

disease, and many other articles, were enough to deter any man living

from a dangerous mixture with the sick people, and make them as

anxious almost to avoid the infections as before.



Nay, there was another thing which made the mere catching of the

distemper frightful, and that was the terrible burning of the caustics

which the surgeons laid on the swellings to bring them to break and to

run, without which the danger of death was very great, even to the

last.  Also, the insufferable torment of the swellings, which, though it

might not make people raving and distracted, as they were before, and

as I have given several instances of already, yet they put the patient to

inexpressible torment; and those that fell into it, though they did

escape with life, yet they made bitter complaints of those that had told

them there was no danger, and sadly repented their rashness and folly

in venturing to run into the reach of it.



Nor did this unwary conduct of the people end here, for a great

many that thus cast off their cautions suffered more deeply still, and

though many escaped, yet many died; and at least it had this public

mischief attending it, that it made the decrease of burials slower than

it would otherwise have been.  For as this notion ran like lightning

through the city, and people's heads were possessed with it, even as

soon as the first great decrease in the bills appeared, we found that the

two next bills did not decrease in proportion; the reason I take to be

the people's running so rashly into danger, giving up all their former

cautions and care, and all the shyness which they used to practise,

depending that the sickness would not reach them - or that if it did,

they should not die.



The physicians opposed this thoughtless humour of the people with

all their might, and gave out printed directions, spreading them all

over the city and suburbs, advising the people to continue reserved,

and to use still the utmost caution in their ordinary conduct,

notwithstanding the decrease of the distemper, terrifying them with

the danger of bringing a relapse upon the whole city, and telling them

how such a relapse might be more fatal and dangerous than the whole

visitation that had been already; with many arguments and reasons to

explain and prove that part to them, and which are too long to repeat here.



But it was all to no purpose; the audacious creatures were so

possessed with the first joy and so surprised with the satisfaction of

seeing a vast decrease in the weekly bills, that they were impenetrable

by any new terrors, and would not be persuaded but that the bitterness

of death was past; and it was to no more purpose to talk to them than

to an east wind; but they opened shops, went about streets, did

business, and conversed with anybody that came in their way to

converse with, whether with business or without, neither inquiring of

their health or so much as being apprehensive of any danger from

them, though they knew them not to be sound.



This imprudent, rash conduct cost a great many their lives who had

with great care and caution shut themselves up and kept retired, as it

were, from all mankind, and had by that means, under God's

providence, been preserved through all the heat of that infection.



This rash and foolish conduct, I say, of the people went so far that

the ministers took notice to them of it at last, and laid before them

both the folly and danger of it; and this checked it a little, so that they

grew more cautious.  But it had another effect, which they could not

check; for as the first rumour had spread not over the city only, but

into the country, it had the like effect: and the people were so tired

with being so long from London, and so eager to come back, that they

flocked to town without fear or forecast, and began to show

themselves in the streets as if all the danger was over.  It was indeed

surprising to see it, for though there died still from 1000 to 1800 a

week, yet the people flocked to town as if all had been well.



The consequence of this was, that the bills increased again 400 the

very first week in November; and if I might believe the physicians,

there was above 3000 fell sick that week, most of them new-comers, too.



One John Cock, a barber in St Martin's-le-Grand, was an eminent

example of this; I mean of the hasty return of the people when the

plague was abated.  This John Cock had left the town with his whole

family, and locked up his house, and was gone in the country, as many

others did; and finding the plague so decreased in November that

there died but 905 per week of all diseases, he ventured home again.

He had in his family ten persons; that is to say, himself and wife, five

children, two apprentices, and a maid-servant.  He had not returned to

his house above a week, and began to open his shop and carry on his

trade, but the distemper broke out in his family, and within about five

days they all died, except one; that is to say, himself, his wife, all his

five children, and his two apprentices; and only the maid remained alive.



But the mercy of God was greater to the rest than we had reason to

expect; for the malignity (as I have said) of the distemper was spent,

the contagion was exhausted, and also the winter weather came on

apace, and the air was clear and cold, with sharp frosts; and this

increasing still, most of those that had fallen sick recovered, and the

health of the city began to return. There were indeed some returns of

the distemper even in the month of December, and the bills increased

near a hundred; but it went off again, and so in a short while things

began to return to their own channel.  And wonderful it was to see

how populous the city was again all on a sudden, so that a stranger

could not miss the numbers that were lost.  Neither was there any miss

of the inhabitants as to their dwellings - few or no empty houses were

to be seen, or if there were some, there was no want of

tenants for them.



I wish I could say that as the city had a new face, so the manners of

the people had a new appearance.  I doubt not but there were many

that retained a sincere sense of their deliverance, and were that

heartily thankful to that Sovereign Hand that had protected them in so

dangerous a time; it would be very uncharitable to judge otherwise in

a city so populous, and where the people were so devout as they were

here in the time of the visitation itself; but except what of this was to

be found in particular families and faces, it must be acknowledged

that the general practice of the people was just as it was before, and

very little difference was to be seen.



Some, indeed, said things were worse; that the morals of the people

declined from this very time; that the people, hardened by the danger

they had been in, like seamen after a storm is over, were more wicked

and more stupid, more bold and hardened, in their vices and immoralities

than they were before; but I will not carry it so far neither.  It would

take up a history of no small length to give a particular of all the

gradations by which the course of things in this city came to be

restored again, and to run in their own channel as they did before.



Some parts of England were now infected as violently as London

had been; the cities of Norwich, Peterborough, Lincoln, Colchester,

and other places were now visited; and the magistrates of London

began to set rules for our conduct as to corresponding with those

cities.  It is true we could not pretend to forbid their people coming to

London, because it was impossible to know them asunder; so, after

many consultations, the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen were

obliged to drop it. All they could do was to warn and caution the

people not to entertain in their houses or converse with any people

who they knew came from such infected places.



But they might as well have talked to the air, for the people of

London thought themselves so plague-free now that they were past all

admonitions; they seemed to depend upon it that the air was restored,

and that the air was like a man that had had the smallpox, not capable

of being infected again.  This revived that notion that the infection

was all in the air, that there was no such thing as contagion from the

sick people to the sound; and so strongly did this whimsy prevail

among people that they ran all together promiscuously, sick and well.

Not the Mahometans, who, prepossessed with the principle of

predestination, value nothing of contagion, let it be in what it will,

could be more obstinate than the people of London; they that were

perfectly sound, and came out of the wholesome air, as we call it, into

the city, made nothing of going into the same houses and chambers,

nay, even into the same beds, with those that had the distemper upon

them, and were not recovered.



Some, indeed, paid for their audacious boldness with the price of

their lives; an infinite number fell sick, and the physicians had more

work than ever, only with this difference, that more of their patients

recovered; that is to say, they generally recovered, but certainly there

were more people infected and fell sick now, when there did not die

above a thousand or twelve hundred in a week, than there was when

there died five or six thousand a week, so entirely negligent were the

people at that time in the great and dangerous case of health and

infection, and so ill were they able to take or accept of the advice of

those who cautioned them for their good.



The people being thus returned, as it were, in general, it was very

strange to find that in their inquiring after their friends, some whole

families were so entirely swept away that there was no remembrance

of them left, neither was anybody to be found to possess or show any

title to that little they had left; for in such cases what was to be found

was generally embezzled and purloined, some gone one way, some another.



It was said such abandoned effects came to the king, as the universal

heir; upon which we are told, and I suppose it was in part true, that the

king granted all such, as deodands, to the Lord Mayor and Court of

Aldermen of London, to be applied to the use of the poor, of whom

there were very many.  For it is to be observed, that though the

occasions of relief and the objects of distress were very many more in

the time of the violence of the plague than now after all was over, yet

the distress of the poor was more now a great deal than it was then,

because all the sluices of general charity were now shut.  People

supposed the main occasion to be over, and so stopped their hands;

whereas particular objects were still very moving, and the distress of

those that were poor was very great indeed.



Though the health of the city was now very much restored, yet

foreign trade did not begin to stir, neither would foreigners admit our

ships into their ports for a great while.  As for the Dutch, the

misunderstandings between our court and them had broken out into a

war the year before, so that our trade that way was wholly interrupted;

but Spain and Portugal, Italy and Barbary, as also Hamburg and all the

ports in the Baltic, these were all shy of us a great while, and would

not restore trade with us for many months.



The distemper sweeping away such multitudes, as I have observed,

many if not all the out-parishes were obliged to make new burying-

grounds, besides that I have mentioned in Bunhill Fields, some of

which were continued, and remain in use to this day.  But others were

left off, and (which I confess I mention with some reflection) being

converted into other uses or built upon afterwards, the dead bodies

were disturbed, abused, dug up again, some even before the flesh of

them was perished from the bones, and removed like dung or rubbish

to other places.  Some of those which came within the reach of my

observation are as follow:



(1) A piece of ground beyond Goswell Street, near Mount Mill,

being some of the remains of the old lines or fortifications of the city,

where abundance were buried promiscuously from the parishes of Aldersgate,

Clerkenwell, and even out of the city.  This ground, as I take it, was

since made a physic garden, and after that has been built upon.



(2) A piece of ground just over the Black Ditch, as it was then

called, at the end of Holloway Lane, in Shoreditch parish. It has been

since made a yard for keeping hogs, and for other ordinary uses, but is

quite out of use as a burying-ground.



(3) The upper end of Hand Alley, in Bishopsgate Street, which was

then a green field, and was taken in particularly for Bishopsgate

parish, though many of the carts out of the city brought their dead

thither also, particularly out of the parish of St All-hallows on the

Wall. This place I cannot mention without much regret. It was, as I

remember, about two or three years after the plague was ceased that

Sir Robert Clayton came to be possessed of the ground. It was

reported, how true I know not, that it fell to the king for want of heirs,

all those who had any right to it being carried off by the pestilence,

and that Sir Robert Clayton obtained a grant of it from King Charles

II. But however he came by it, certain it is the ground was let out to

build on, or built upon, by his order. The first house built upon it was

a large fair house, still standing, which faces the street or way now

called Hand Alley which, though called an alley, is as wide as a street.

The houses in the same row with that house northward are built on the

very same ground where the poor people were buried, and the bodies,

on opening the ground for the foundations, were dug up, some of them

remaining so plain to be seen that the women's skulls were

distinguished by their long hair, and of others the flesh was not quite

perished; so that the people began to exclaim loudly against it, and

some suggested that it might endanger a return of the contagion; after

which the bones and bodies, as fast as they came at them, were carried

to another part of the same ground and thrown all together into a deep

pit, dug on purpose, which now is to be known in that it is not built

on, but is a passage to another house at the upper end of Rose Alley,

just against the door of a meeting-house which has been built there

many years since; and the ground is palisadoed off from the rest of the

passage, in a little square; there lie the bones and remains of near two

thousand bodies, carried by the dead carts to their grave in that one year.



(4) Besides this, there was a piece of ground in Moorfields; by the

going into the street which is now called Old Bethlem, which was

enlarged much, though not wholly taken in on the same occasion.



[N.B. - The author of this journal lies buried in that very ground,

being at his own desire, his sister having been buried there a few

years before.]



(5) Stepney parish, extending itself from the east part of London to

the north, even to the very edge of Shoreditch Churchyard, had a piece

of ground taken in to bury their dead close to the said churchyard, and

which for that very reason was left open, and is since, I suppose, taken

into the same churchyard. And they had also two other burying-places

in Spittlefields, one where since a chapel or tabernacle has been built

for ease to this great parish, and another in Petticoat Lane.



There were no less than five other grounds made use of for the

parish of Stepney at that time: one where now stands the parish church

of St Paul, Shadwell, and the other where now stands the parish

church of St John's at Wapping, both which had not the names of

parishes at that time, but were belonging to Stepney parish.



I could name many more, but these coming within my particular

knowledge, the circumstance, I thought, made it of use to record

them. From the whole, it may be observed that they were obliged in

this time of distress to take in new burying-grounds in most of the out-

parishes for laying the prodigious numbers of people which died in so

short a space of time; but why care was not taken to keep those places

separate from ordinary uses, that so the bodies might rest undisturbed,

that I cannot answer for, and must confess I think it was wrong. Who

were to blame I know not.



I should have mentioned that the Quakers had at that time also a

burying-ground set apart to their use, and which they still make use of;

and they had also a particular dead-cart to fetch their dead from their

houses; and the famous Solomon Eagle, who, as I mentioned before,

had predicted the plague as a judgement, and ran naked through the

streets, telling the people that it was come upon them to punish them

for their sins, had his own wife died the very next day of the plague,

and was carried, one of the first in the Quakers' dead-cart, to their new

burying-ground.



I might have thronged this account with many more remarkable

things which occurred in the time of the infection, and particularly

what passed between the Lord Mayor and the Court, which was then

at Oxford, and what directions were from time to time received from

the Government for their conduct on this critical occasion. But really

the Court concerned themselves so little, and that little they did was of

so small import, that I do not see it of much moment to mention any

part of it here: except that of appointing a monthly fast in the city and

the sending the royal charity to the relief of the poor, both which I

have mentioned before.



Great was the reproach thrown on those physicians who left their

patients during the sickness, and now they came to town again nobody

cared to employ them. They were called deserters, and frequently bills

were set up upon their doors and written, 'Here is a doctor to be let', so

that several of those physicians were fain for a while to sit still and

look about them, or at least remove their dwellings, and set up in new

places and among new acquaintance. The like was the case with the

clergy, whom the people were indeed very abusive to, writing verses

and scandalous reflections upon them, setting upon the church-door,

'Here is a pulpit to be let', or sometimes, 'to be sold', which was worse.



It was not the least of our misfortunes that with our infection, when

it ceased, there did not cease the spirit of strife and contention, slander

and reproach, which was really the great troubler of the nation's peace

before. It was said to be the remains of the old animosities, which had

so lately involved us all in blood and disorder. But as the late Act of

Indemnity had laid asleep the quarrel itself, so the Government had

recommended family and personal peace upon all occasions to the

whole nation.



But it could not be obtained; and particularly after the ceasing of the

plague in London, when any one that had seen the condition which the

people had been in, and how they caressed one another at that time,

promised to have more charity for the future, and to raise no more

reproaches; I say, any one that had seen them then would have thought

they would have come together with another spirit at last. But, I say,

it could not be obtained. The quarrel remained; the Church and the

Presbyterians were incompatible. As soon as the plague was removed,

the Dissenting ousted ministers who had supplied the pulpits which

were deserted by the incumbents retired; they could expect no other

but that they should immediately fall upon them and harass them with

their penal laws, accept their preaching while they were sick, and

persecute them as soon as they were recovered again; this even we

that were of the Church thought was very hard, and could by no means

approve of it.



But it was the Government, and we could say nothing to hinder it;

we could only say it was not our doing, and we could not answer for it.



On the other hand, the Dissenters reproaching those ministers of the

Church with going away and deserting their charge, abandoning the

people in their danger, and when they had most need of comfort, and

the like: this we could by no means approve, for all men have not the

same faith and the same courage, and the Scripture commands us to

judge the most favourably and according to charity.



A plague is a formidable enemy, and is armed with terrors that every

man is not sufficiently fortified to resist or prepared to stand the shock

against. It is very certain that a great many of the clergy who were in

circumstances to do it withdrew and fled for the safety of their lives;

but 'tis true also that a great many of them stayed, and many of them

fell in the calamity and in the discharge of their duty.



It is true some of the Dissenting turned-out ministers stayed, and

their courage is to be commended and highly valued - but these were

not abundance; it cannot be said that they all stayed, and that none

retired into the country, any more than it can be said of the Church

clergy that they all went away. Neither did all those that went away go

without substituting curates and others in their places, to do the

offices needful and to visit the sick, as far as it was practicable; so

that, upon the whole, an allowance of charity might have been made

on both sides, and we should have considered that such a time as this

of 1665 is not to be paralleled in history, and that it is not the stoutest

courage that will always support men in such cases.  I had not said

this, but had rather chosen to record the courage and religious zeal of

those of both sides, who did hazard themselves for the service of the

poor people in their distress, without remembering that any failed in

their duty on either side.  But the want of temper among us has made

the contrary to this necessary: some that stayed not only boasting too

much of themselves, but reviling those that fled, branding them with

cowardice, deserting their flocks, and acting the part of the hireling,

and the like.  I recommend it to the charity of all good people to look

back and reflect duly upon the terrors of the time, and whoever does

so well see that it is not an ordinary strength that could support it.  It

was not like appearing in the head of an army or charging a body of

horse in the field, but it was charging Death itself on his pale horse; to

stay was indeed to die, and it could be esteemed nothing less,

especially as things appeared at the latter end of August and the

beginning of September, and as there was reason to expect them at

that time; for no man expected, and I dare say believed, that the

distemper would take so sudden a turn as it did, and fall immediately

two thousand in a week, when there was such a prodigious number of

people sick at that time as it was known there was; and then it was

that many shifted away that had stayed most of the time before.



Besides, if God gave strength to some more than to others, was it to

boast of their ability to abide the stroke, and upbraid those that had

not the same gift and support, or ought not they rather to have been

humble and thankful if they were rendered more useful than their

brethren?



I think it ought to be recorded to the honour of such men, as well

clergy as physicians, surgeons, apothecaries, magistrates, and officers

of every kind, as also all useful people who ventured their lives in

discharge of their duty, as most certainly all such as stayed did to the

last degree; and several of all these kinds did not only venture but lose

their lives on that sad occasion.



I was once making a list of all such, I mean of all those professions

and employments who thus died, as I call it, in the way of their duty;

but it was impossible for a private man to come at a certainty in the

particulars.  I only remember that there died sixteen clergymen, two

aldermen, five physicians, thirteen surgeons, within the city and

liberties before the beginning of September.  But this being, as I said

before, the great crisis and extremity of the infection, it can be no

complete list.  As to inferior people, I think there died six-and-forty

constables and head-boroughs in the two parishes of Stepney and

Whitechappel; but I could not carry my list oil, for when the violent

rage of the distemper in September came upon us, it drove us out of

all measures.  Men did then no more (lie by tale and by number.  They

might put out a weekly bill, and call them seven or eight thousand, or

what they pleased; 'tis certain they died by heaps, and were buried by

heaps, that is to say, without account.  And if I might believe some

people, who were more abroad and more conversant with those things

than I though I was public enough for one that had no more business

to do than I had, - I say, if I may believe them, there was not many less

buried those first three weeks in September than 20,000 per week.

However, the others aver the truth of it; yet I rather choose to keep to

the public account; seven and eight thousand per week is enough to

make good all that I have said of the terror of those times; -and it is

much to the satisfaction of me that write, as well as those that read, to

be able to say that everything is set down with moderation, and rather

within compass than beyond it.



Upon all these accounts, I say, I could wish, when we were

recovered, our conduct had been more distinguished for charity and

kindness in remembrance of the past calamity, and not so much a

valuing ourselves upon our boldness in staying, as if all men were

cowards that fly from the hand of God, or that those who stay do not

sometimes owe their courage to their ignorance, and despising the

hand of their Maker - which is a criminal kind of desperation, and not

a true courage.



I cannot but leave it upon record that the civil officers, such as

constables, head-boroughs, Lord Mayor's and sheriffs'-men, as also

parish officers, whose business it was to take charge of the poor, did

their duties in general with as much courage as any, and perhaps with

more, because their work was attended with more hazards, and lay

more among the poor, who were more subject to be infected, and in

the most pitiful plight when they were taken with the infection.  But

then it must be added, too, that a great number of them died; indeed it

was scarce possible it should be otherwise.



I have not said one word here about the physic or preparations that

we ordinarily made use of on this terrible occasion - I mean we that

went frequently abroad and up down street, as I did; much of this was

talked of in the books and bills of our quack doctors, of whom I have

said enough already.  It may, however, be added, that the College of

Physicians were daily publishing several preparations, which they had

considered of in the process of their practice, and which, being to be

had in print, I avoid repeating them for that reason.



One thing I could not help observing: what befell one of the quacks,

who published that he had a most excellent preservative against the

plague, which whoever kept about them should never be infected or

liable to infection.  This man, who, we may reasonably suppose, did

not go abroad without some of this excellent preservative in his

pocket, yet was taken by the distemper, and carried off in two or three

days.



I am not of the number of the physic-haters or physic-despisers; on

the contrary, I have often mentioned the regard I had to the dictates of

my particular friend Dr Heath; but yet I must acknowledge I made use

of little or nothing - except, as I have observed, to keep a preparation

of strong scent to have ready, in case I met with anything of offensive

smells or went too near any burying-place or dead body.



Neither did I do what I know some did: keep the spirits always high

and hot with cordials and wine and such things; and which, as I

observed, one learned physician used himself so much to as that he

could not leave them off when the infection was quite gone, and so

became a sot for all his life after.



I remember my friend the doctor used to say that there was a certain

set of drugs and preparations which were all certainly good and useful

in the case of an infection; out of which, or with which, physicians

might make an infinite variety of medicines, as the ringers of bells

make several hundred different rounds of music by the changing and

order or sound but in six bells, and that all these preparations shall be

really very good: 'Therefore,' said he, 'I do not wonder that so vast a

throng of medicines is offered in the present calamity, and almost

every physician prescribes or prepares a different thing, as his

judgement or experience guides him; but', says my friend, 'let all the

prescriptions of all the physicians in London be examined, and it will

be found that they are all compounded of the same things, with such

variations only as the particular fancy of the doctor leads him to; so

that', says he, 'every man, judging a little of his own constitution and

manner of his living, and circumstances of his being infected, may

direct his own medicines out of the ordinary drugs and preparations.

Only that', says he, 'some recommend one thing as most sovereign,

and some another.  Some', says he, 'think that pill. ruff., which is

called itself the anti-pestilential pill is the best preparation that can be

made; others think that Venice treacle is sufficient of itself to resist

the contagion; and I', says he, 'think as both these think, viz., that the

last is good to take beforehand to prevent it, and the first, if touched,

to expel it.' According to this opinion, I several times took Venice

treacle, and a sound sweat upon it, and thought myself as well

fortified against the infection as any one could be fortified by the

power of physic.



As for quackery and mountebanks, of which the town was so full, I

listened to none of them, and have observed often since, with some

wonder, that for two years after the plague I scarcely saw or heard of

one of them about town.  Some fancied they were all swept away in

the infection to a man, and were for calling it a particular mark of

God's vengeance upon them for leading the poor people into the pit of

destruction, merely for the lucre of a little money they got by them;

but I cannot go that length neither.  That abundance of them died is

certain - many of them came within the reach of my own knowledge -

but that all of them were swept off I much question.  I believe rather

they fled into the country and tried their practices upon the people

there, who were in apprehension of the infection before it came

among them.



This, however, is certain, not a man of them appeared for a great

while in or about London.  There were, indeed, several doctors who

published bills recommending their several physical preparations for

cleansing the body, as they call it, after the plague, and needful, as

they said, for such people to take who had been visited and had been

cured; whereas I must own I believe that it was the opinion of the

most eminent physicians at that time that the plague was itself a

sufficient purge, and that those who escaped the infection needed no

physic to cleanse their bodies of any other things; the running sores,

the tumours, &c., which were broke and kept open by the directions of

the physicians, having sufficiently cleansed them; and that all other

distempers, and causes of distempers, were effectually carried off that

way; and as the physicians gave this as their opinions wherever they

came, the quacks got little business.



There were, indeed, several little hurries which happened after the

decrease of the plague, and which, whether they were contrived to

fright and disorder the people, as some imagined, I cannot say, but

sometimes we were told the plague would return by such a time; and

the famous Solomon Eagle, the naked Quaker I have mentioned,

prophesied evil tidings every day; and several others telling us that

London had not been sufficiently scourged, and that sorer and severer

strokes were yet behind.  Had they stopped there, or had they

descended to particulars, and told us that the city should the next year

be destroyed by fire, then, indeed, when we had seen it come to pass,

we should not have been to blame to have paid more than a common

respect to their prophetic spirits; at least we should have wondered at

them, and have been more serious in our inquiries after the meaning

of it, and whence they had the foreknowledge.  But as they generally

told us of a relapse into the plague, we have had no concern since that

about them; yet by those frequent clamours, we were all kept with

some kind of apprehensions constantly upon us; and if any died

suddenly, or if the spotted fevers at any time increased, we were

presently alarmed; much more if the number of the plague increased,

for to the end of the year there were always between 200 and 300 of

the plague.  On any of these occasions, I say, we were alarmed anew.



Those who remember the city of London before the fire must

remember that there was then no such place as we now call Newgate

Market, but that in the middle of the street which is now called Blow-

bladder Street, and which had its name from the butchers, who used to

kill and dress their sheep there (and who, it seems, had a custom to

blow up their meat with pipes to make it look thicker and fatter than it

was, and were punished there for it by the Lord Mayor); I say, from

the end of the street towards Newgate there stood two long rows of

shambles for the selling meat.



It was in those shambles that two persons falling down dead, as they

were buying meat, gave rise to a rumour that the meat was all

infected; which, though it might affright the people, and spoiled the

market for two or three days, yet it appeared plainly afterwards that

there was nothing of truth in the suggestion.  But nobody can account

for the possession of fear when it takes hold of the mind.



However, it Pleased God, by the continuing of the winter weather,

so to restore the health of the city that by February following we

reckoned the distemper quite ceased, and then we were not so easily

frighted again.



There was still a question among the learned, and at first perplexed

the people a little: and that was in what manner to purge the house and

goods where the plague had been, and how to render them habitable

again, which had been left empty during the time of the plague.

Abundance- of perfumes and preparations were prescribed by

physicians, some of one kind and some of another, in which the

people who listened to them put themselves to a great, and indeed, in

my opinion, to an unnecessary expense; and the poorer people, who

only set open their windows night and day, burned brimstone, pitch,

and gunpowder, and such things in their rooms, did as well as the

best; nay, the eager people who, as I said above, came home in haste

and at all hazards, found little or no inconvenience in their houses, nor

in the goods, and did little or nothing to them.



However, in general, prudent, cautious people did enter into some

measures for airing and sweetening their houses, and burned

perfumes, incense, benjamin, rozin, and sulphur in their rooms close

shut up, and then let the air carry it all out with a blast of gunpowder;

others caused large fires to be made all day and all night for several

days and nights; by the same token that two or three were pleased to

set their houses on fire, and so effectually sweetened them by burning

them down to the ground; as particularly one at Ratcliff, one in

Holbourn, and one at Westminster; besides two or three that were set

on fire, but the fire was happily got out again before it went far

enough to bum down the houses; and one citizen's servant, I think it

was in Thames Street, carried so much gunpowder into his master's

house, for clearing it of the infection, and managed it so foolishly, that

he blew up part of the roof of the house.  But the time was not fully

come that the city was to he purged by fire, nor was it far off; for

within nine months more I saw it all lying in ashes; when, as some of

our quacking philosophers pretend, the seeds of the plague were

entirely destroyed, and not before; a notion too ridiculous to speak of

here: since, had the seeds of the plague remained in the houses, not to

be destroyed but by fire, how has it been that they have not since

broken out, seeing all those buildings in the suburbs and liberties, all

in the great parishes of Stepney, Whitechappel, Aldgate, Bishopsgate,

Shoreditch, Cripplegate, and St Giles, where the fire never came, and

where the plague raged with the greatest violence, remain still in the

same condition they were in before?



But to leave these things just as I found them, it was certain that

those people who were more than ordinarily cautious of their health,

did take particular directions for what they called seasoning of their

houses, and abundance of costly things were consumed on that

account which I cannot but say not only seasoned those houses, as

they desired, but filled the air with very grateful and wholesome

smells which others had the share of the benefit of as well as those

who were at the expenses of them.



And yet after all, though the poor came to town very precipitantly,

as I have said, yet I must say the rich made no such haste.  The men of

business, indeed, came up, but many of them did not bring their

families to town till the spring came on, and that they saw reason to

depend upon it that the plague would not return.



The Court, indeed, came up soon after Christmas, but the nobility

and gentry, except such as depended upon and had employment under

the administration, did not come so soon.



I should have taken notice here that, notwithstanding the violence of

the plague in London and in other places, yet it was very observable

that it was never on board the fleet; and yet for some time there was a

strange press in the river, and even in the streets, for seamen to man

the fleet.  But it was in the beginning of the year, when the plague was

scarce begun, and not at all come down to that part of the city where

they usually press for seamen; and though a war with the Dutch was

not at all grateful to the people at that time, and the seamen went with

a kind of reluctancy into the service, and many complained of being

dragged into it by force, yet it proved in the event a happy violence to

several of them, who had probably perished in the general calamity,

and who, after the summer service was over, though they had cause to

lament the desolation of their families - who, when they came back,

were many of them in their graves - yet they had room to be thankful

that they were carried out of the reach of it, though so much against

their wills.  We indeed had a hot war with the Dutch that year, and

one very great engagement at sea in which the Dutch were worsted,

but we lost a great many men and some ships.  But, as I observed, the

plague was not in the fleet, and when they came to lay up the ships in

the river the violent part of it began to abate.



I would be glad if I could close the account of this melancholy year

with some particular examples historically; I mean of the thankfulness

to God, our preserver, for our being delivered from this dreadful

calamity.  Certainly the circumstance of the deliverance, as well as the

terrible enemy we were delivered from, called upon the whole nation

for it.  The circumstances of the deliverance were indeed very

remarkable, as I have in part mentioned already, and particularly the

dreadful condition which we were all in when we were to the surprise

of the whole town made joyful with the hope of a stop of the infection.



Nothing but the immediate finger of God, nothing but omnipotent

power, could have done it.  The contagion despised all medicine;

death raged in every corner; and had it gone on as it did then, a few

weeks more would have cleared the town of all, and everything that

had a soul.  Men everywhere began to despair; every heart failed them

for fear; people were made desperate through the anguish of their

souls, and the terrors of death sat in the very faces and countenances

of the people.



In that very moment when we might very well say, 'Vain was the

help of man', - I say, in that very moment it pleased God, with a most

agreeable surprise, to cause the fury of it to abate, even of itself; and

the malignity declining, as I have said, though infinite numbers were

sick, yet fewer died, and the very first weeks' bill decreased 1843; a

vast number indeed!



It is impossible to express the change that appeared in the very

countenances of the people that Thursday morning when the weekly

bill came out.  It might have been perceived in their countenances that

a secret surprise and smile of joy sat on everybody's face.  They shook

one another by the hands in the streets, who would hardly go on the

same side of the way with one another before.  Where the streets were

not too broad they would open their windows and call from one house

to another, and ask how they did, and if they had heard the good news

that the plague was abated.  Some would return, when they said good

news, and ask, 'What good news?' and when they answered that the

plague was abated and the bills decreased almost two thousand, they

would cry out, 'God be praised I' and would weep aloud for joy, telling

them they had heard nothing of it; and such was the joy of the people

that it was, as it were, life to them from the grave.  I could almost set

down as many extravagant things done in the excess of their joy as of

their grief; but that would be to lessen the value of it.



I must confess myself to have been very much dejected just before

this happened; for the prodigious number that were taken sick the

week or two before, besides those that died, was such, and the

lamentations were so great everywhere, that a man must have seemed

to have acted even against his reason if he had so much as expected to

escape; and as there was hardly a house but mine in all my

neighbourhood but was infected, so had it gone on it would not have

been long that there would have been any more neighbours to be

infected.  Indeed it is hardly credible what dreadful havoc the last

three weeks had made, for if I might believe the person whose

calculations I always found very well grounded, there were not less

than 30,000 people dead and near 100.000 fallen sick in the three

weeks I speak of; for the number that sickened was surprising, indeed

it was astonishing, and those whose courage upheld them all the time

before, sank under it now.



In the middle of their distress, when the condition of the city of

London was so truly calamitous, just then it pleased God - as it were

by His immediate hand to disarm this enemy; the poison was taken

out of the sting.  It was wonderful; even the physicians themselves

were surprised at it.  Wherever they visited they found their patients

better; either they had sweated kindly, or the tumours were broke, or

the carbuncles went down and the inflammations round them changed

colour, or the fever was gone, or the violent headache was assuaged,

or some good symptom was in the case; so that in a few days

everybody was recovering, whole families that were infected and

down, that had ministers praying with them, and expected death every

hour, were revived and healed, and none died at all out of them.



Nor was this by any new medicine found out, or new method of cure

discovered, or by any experience in the operation which the

physicians or surgeons attained to; but it was evidently from the secret

invisible hand of Him that had at first sent this disease as a judgement

upon us; and let the atheistic part of mankind call my saying what

they please, it is no enthusiasm; it was acknowledged at that time by

all mankind.  The disease was enervated and its malignity spent; and

let it proceed from whencesoever it will, let the philosophers search

for reasons in nature to account for it by, and labour as much as they

will to lessen the debt they owe to their Maker, those physicians who

had the least share of religion in them were obliged to acknowledge

that it was all supernatural, that it was extraordinary, and that no

account could be given of it.



If I should say that this is a visible summons to us all to

thankfulness, especially we that were under the terror of its increase,

perhaps it may be thought by some, after the sense of the thing was

over, an officious canting of religious things, preaching a sermon

instead of writing a history, making myself a teacher instead of giving

my observations of things; and this restrains me very much from going

on here as I might otherwise do.  But if ten lepers Were healed, and

but one returned to give thanks, I desire to be as that one, and to be

thankful for myself.



Nor will I deny but there were abundance of people who, to all appearance,

were very thankful at that time; for their mouths were stopped, even the

mouths of those whose hearts were not extraordinary long affected with it.

But the impression was so strong at that time that it could not be resisted;

no, not by the worst of the people.



It was a common thing to meet people in the street that were

strangers, and that we knew nothing at all of, expressing their surprise.

Going one day through Aldgate, and a pretty many people being

passing and repassing, there comes a man out of the end of the

Minories, and looking a little up the street and down, he throws his

hands abroad, 'Lord, what an alteration is here I Why, last week I

came along here, and hardly anybody was to he seen.' Another man - I

heard him - adds to his words, "Tis all wonderful; 'tis all a dream.'

'Blessed be God,' says a third man, d and let us give thanks to Him, for

'tis all His own doing, human help and human skill was at an end.'

These were all strangers to one another.  But such salutations as these

were frequent in the street every day; and in spite of a loose

behaviour, the very common people went along the streets giving God

thanks for their deliverance.



It was now, as I said before, the people had cast off all

apprehensions, and that too fast; indeed we were no more afraid now

to pass by a man with a white cap upon his head, or with a doth wrapt

round his neck, or with his leg limping, occasioned by the sores in his

groin, all which were frightful to the last degree, but the week before.

But now the street was full of them, and these poor recovering

creatures, give them their due, appeared very sensible of their

unexpected deliverance; and I should wrong them very much if I

should not acknowledge that I believe many of them were really

thankful.  But I must own that, for the generality of the people, it

might too justly be said of them as was said of the children of Israel

after their being delivered from the host of Pharaoh, when they passed

the Red Sea, and looked back and saw the Egyptians overwhelmed in

the water: viz., that they sang His praise, but they soon forgot His works.



I can go no farther here.  I should be counted censorious, and

perhaps unjust, if I should enter into the unpleasing work of reflecting,

whatever cause there was for it, upon the unthankfulness and return of

all manner of wickedness among us, which I was so much an eye-

witness of myself.  I shall conclude the account of this calamitous

year therefore with a coarse but sincere stanza of my own, which I

placed at the end of my ordinary memorandums the same year they

were written: -



  A dreadful plague in London was

  In the year sixty-five,

  Which swept an hundred thousand souls

  Away; yet I alive!
