<I>A Song for Occupations</I></H1></CENTER>

<CENTER>1</CENTER>


<P>A <FONT SIZE=-1>SONG</FONT> for occupations!
<BR>In the labor of engines and trades and the labor of fields
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I find the developments,
<BR>And find the eternal meanings.

<P>&nbsp;Workmen and Workwomen!
<BR>Were all educations practical and ornamental well display'd
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out of me, what would it amount to?
<BR>Were I as the head teacher, charitable proprietor, wise
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; statesman, what would it amount to?
<BR>Were I to you as the boss employing and paying you, would
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that satisfy you?

<P>&nbsp;The learn'd, virtuous, benevolent, and the usual terms,
<BR>A man like me and never the usual terms.

<P>&nbsp;Neither a servant nor a master I,
<BR>I take no sooner a large price than a small price, I will
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have my own whoever enjoys me,
<BR>I will be even with you and you shall be even with me.

<P>&nbsp;If you stand at work in a shop I stand as nigh as the nighest
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the same shop,
<BR>If you bestow gifts on your brother or dearest friend I
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; demand as good as your brother or dearest
friend,
<BR>If your lover, husband, wife, is welcome by day or night, I
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; must be personally as welcome,
<BR>If you become degraded, criminal, ill, then I become so for
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your sake,
<BR>If you remember your foolish and outlaw'd deeds, do you think
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot remember my own foolish and outlaw'd
deeds?
<BR>If you carouse at the table I carouse at the opposite side of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the table,
<BR>If you meet some stranger in the streets and love him or her,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; why I often meet strangers in the street and
love them.

<P>&nbsp;Why what have you thought of yourself?
<BR>Is it you then that thought yourself less?
<BR>Is it you that thought the President greater than you?
<BR>Or the rich better off than you? or the educated wiser than
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you?

<P>&nbsp;(Because you are greasy or pimpled, or were once drunk,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or a thief,
<BR>Or that you are diseas'd, or rheumatic, or a prostitute,
<BR>Or from frivolity or impotence, or that you are no scholar
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and never saw your name in print,
<BR>Do you give in that you are any less immortal?)

<P>&nbsp;
<CENTER>2</CENTER>


<P>Souls of men and women! it is not you I call unseen, unheard,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; untouchable and untouching,
<BR>It is not you I go argue pro and con about, and to settle
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whether you are alive or no,
<BR>I own publicly who you are, if nobody else owns.

<P>&nbsp;Grown, half-grown and babe, of this country and every
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; country, indoors and out-doors, one just as
much as
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the other, I see,
<BR>And all else behind or through them.

<P>&nbsp;The wife, and she is not one jot less than the husband,
<BR>The daughter, and she is just as good as the son,
<BR>The mother, and she is every bit as much as the father.

<P>&nbsp;Offspring of ignorant and poor, boys apprenticed to trades,
<BR>Young fellows working on farms and old fellows working on
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; farms,
<BR>Sailor-men, merchant-men, coasters, immigrants,
<BR>All these I see, but nigher and farther the same I see,
<BR>None shall escape me and none shall wish to escape me.

<P>&nbsp;I bring what you much need yet always have,
<BR>Not money, amours, dress, eating, erudition, but as good,
<BR>I send no agent or medium, offer no representative of value,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but offer the value itself.

<P>&nbsp;There is something that comes to one now and perpetually,
<BR>It is not what is printed, preach'd, discussed, it eludes
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; discussion and print,
<BR>It is not to be put in a book, it is not in this book,
<BR>It is for you whoever you are, it is no farther from you
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than your hearing and sight are from you,
<BR>It is hinted by nearest, commonest, readiest, it is ever
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; provoked by them.

<P>&nbsp;You may read in many languages, yet read nothing about it,
<BR>You may read the President's message and read nothing
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; about it there,
<BR>Nothing in the reports from the State department or Treasury
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; department, or in the daily papers or weekly
papers,
<BR>Or in the census or revenue returns, prices current, or any
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; accounts of stock.

<P>&nbsp;

<P>The sun and stars that float in the open air,
<BR>The apple-shaped earth and we upon it, surely the drift of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them is something grand,

<P>&nbsp;I do not know what it is except that it is grand, and that
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it is happiness,
<BR>And that the enclosing purport of us here is not a speculation
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or bon-mot or reconnoissance,
<BR>And that it is not something which by luck may turn out well
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for us, and without luck must be a failure
for us,
<BR>And not something which may yet be retracted in a certain
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contingency.

<P>&nbsp;The light and shade, the curious sense of body and identity, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; greed that with perfect complaisance devours
all things,
<BR>The endless pride and outstretching of man, unspeakable joys
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and sorrows,
<BR>The wonder every one sees in every one else he sees, and the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wonders that fill each minute of time forever,
<BR>What have you reckon'd them for, camerado?
<BR>Have you reckon'd them for your trade or farm-work? or for
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the profits of your store?
<BR>Or to achieve yourself a position? or to fill a gentleman's
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; leisure, or a lady's leisure?

<P>&nbsp;Have you reckon'd that the landscape took substance and form
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that it might be painted in a picture?
<BR>Or men and women that they might be written of, and songs
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sung?
<BR>Or the attraction of gravity, and the great laws and harmonious
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; combinations and the fluids of the air, as
subjects for the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; savans?
<BR>Or the brown land and the blue sea for maps and charts?
<BR>Or the stars to be put in constellations and named fancy names?
<BR>Or that the growth of seeds is for agricultural tables, or
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; agriculture itself?

<P>&nbsp;Old institutions, these arts, libraries, legends, collections,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the practice handed along in manufactures,
will we rate
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them so high?
<BR>Will we rate our cash and business high? I have no objection,
<BR>I rate them as high as the highest &amp;emdash; then a child born
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of a woman and man I rate beyond all rate.

<P>&nbsp;We thought our Union grand, and our Constitution grand,
<BR>I do not say they are not grand and good, for they are,
<BR>I am this day just as much in love with them as you,
<BR>Then I am in love with You, and with all my fellows upon
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the earth.

<P>&nbsp;We consider bibles and religions divine &amp;emdash; I do not
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; say they are not divine,
<BR>I say they have all grown out of you, and may grow out of you
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; still,
<BR>It is not they who give the life, it is you who give the life,
<BR>Leaves are not more shed from the trees, or trees from the earth,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than they are shed out of you.

<P>&nbsp;
<CENTER>4</CENTER>


<P>The sum of all known reverence I add up in you whoever you are,
<BR>The President is there in the White House for you, it is not you
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who are here for him,
<BR>The Secretaries act in their bureaus for you, not you here for them,
<BR>The Congress convenes every Twelfth-month for you,
<BR>Laws, courts, the forming of States, the charters of cities, the going
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and coming of commerce and mails, are all
for you.

<P>&nbsp;List close my scholars dear,
<BR>Doctrines, politics and civilization exurge from you,
<BR>Sculpture and monuments and any thing inscribed anywhere are
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tallied in you,
<BR>The gist of histories and statistics as far back as the records
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reach is in you this hour, and myths and tales
the same,
<BR>If you were not breathing and walking here, where would they
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all be?
<BR>The most renown'd poems would be ashes, orations and plays
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; would be vacuums.

<P>&nbsp;All architecture is what you do to it when you look upon it,
<BR>(Did you think it was in the white or gray stone? or the lines
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the arches and cornices?)

<P>&nbsp;All music is what awakes from you when you are reminded
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by the instruments,
<BR>It is not the violins and the cornets, it is not the oboe nor
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the beating drums, nor the score of the baritone
singer
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; singing his sweet romanza, nor that of the
men's chorus,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor that of the women's chorus,
<BR>It is nearer and farther than they.

<P>&nbsp;
<CENTER>5</CENTER>


<P>Will the whole come back then?
<BR>Can each see signs of the best by a look in the looking-glass?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is there nothing greater or more?
<BR>Does all sit there with you, with the mystic unseen soul?

<P>&nbsp;Strange and hard that paradox true I give,
<BR>Objects gross and the unseen soul are one.

<P>&nbsp;House-building, measuring, sawing the boards,
<BR>Blacksmithing, glass-blowing, nail-making, coopering,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tin-roofing, shingle-dressing,
<BR>Ship-joining, dock-building, fish-curing, flagging of sidewalks
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by flaggers,
<BR>The pump, the pile-driver, the great derrick, the coal-kiln
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and brick-kiln,
<BR>Coal-mines and all that is down there, the lamps in the darkness,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; echoes, songs, what meditations, what vast
native thoughts
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; looking through smutch'd faces,
<BR>Iron-works, forge-fires in the mountains or by river-banks, men
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; around feeling the melt with huge crowbars,
lumps of ore,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the due combining of ore, limestone, coal,
<BR>The blast-furnace and the puddling-furnace, the loup-lump at the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bottom of the melt at last, the rolling-mill,
the stumpy bars
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of pig-iron, the strong, clean-shaped T-rail
for railroads,
<BR>Oil-works, silk-works, white-lead-works, the sugar-house,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; steam-saws, the great mills and factories,
<BR>Stone-cutting, shapely trimmings for fa&ccedil;ades or window or
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; door-lintels, the mallet, the tooth-chisel,
the jib to protect
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the thumb,
<BR>The calking-iron, the kettle of boiling vault-cement, and the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fire under the kettle,

<P>&nbsp;The cotton-bale, the stevedore's hook, the saw and buck of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sawyer, the mould of the moulder, the working-knife
of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; butcher, the ice-saw, and all the work with
ice,
<BR>The work and tools of the rigger, grappler, sail-maker, block-
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; maker,
<BR>Goods of gutta-percha, papier-mach&eacute;, colors, brushes, brush-
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; making, glazier's implements,
<BR>The veneer and glue-pot, the confectioner's ornaments, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; decanter and glasses, the shears and flat-iron,
<BR>The awl and knee-strap, the pint measure and quart measure,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the counter and stool, the writing-pen of
quill or metal, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; making of all sorts of edged tools,
<BR>The brewery, brewing, the malt, the vats, everything that is
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; done by brewers, wine-makers, vinegar-makers,
<BR>Leather-dressing, coach-making, boiler-making, rope-twisting,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; distilling, sign-painting, lime-burning, cotton-picking,
electro-
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; plating, electrotyping, stereotyping,
<BR>Stave-machines, planing-machines, reaping-machines,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ploughing-machines, thrashing-machines, steam
wagons,
<BR>The cart of the carman, the omnibus, the ponderous dray,
<BR>Pyrotechny, letting off color'd fireworks at night, fancy figures
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and jets;
<BR>Beef on the butcher's stall, the slaughter-house of the butcher,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the butcher in his killing-clothes,
<BR>The pens of live pork, the killing-hammer, the hog-hook, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scalder's tub, gutting, the cutter's cleaver,
the packer's
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; maul, and the plenteous winterwork of pork-packing,
<BR>Flour-works, grinding of wheat, rye, maize, rice, the barrels
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the half and quarter barrels, the loaded
barges, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; high piles on wharves and levees,
<BR>The men and the work of the men on ferries, railroad,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; coasters, fish-boats, canals;
<BR>The hourly routine of your own or any man's life, the shop,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yard, store, or factory,
<BR>These shows all near you by day and night&amp;emdash;workman!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whoever you are, your daily life!
<BR>In that and them the heft of the heaviest&amp;emdash;in that and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them far more than you estimated, (and far
less also,)
<BR>In them realities for you and me, in them poems for you and me,

<P>&nbsp;In them, not yourself&amp;emdash;you and your soul enclose all
things,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; regardless of estimation,
<BR>In them the development good&amp;emdash;in them all themes, hints,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; possibilities.
<BR>I do not affirm that what you see beyond is futile, I do not advise
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you to stop,
<BR>I do not say leadings you thought great are not great,
<BR>But I say that none lead to greater than these lead to.

<P>&nbsp;

<P>Will you seek afar off? you surely come back at last,
<BR>In things best known to you finding the best, or as good as
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the best,
<BR>In folks nearest to you finding the sweetest, strongest,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lovingest,
<BR>Happiness, knowledge, not in another place but this place,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not for another hour but this hour,
<BR>Man in the first you see or touch, always in friend, brother,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nighest neighbor&amp;emdash;woman in mother,
sister, wife,
<BR>The popular tastes and employments taking precedence in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; poems or anywhere,
<BR>You workwomen and workmen of these States having your
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; own divine and strong life,
<BR>And all else giving place to men and women like you.

<P>&nbsp;When the psalm sings instead of the singer,
<BR>When the script preaches instead of the preacher,
<BR>When the pulpit descends and goes instead of the carver that
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; carved the supporting desk,
<BR>When I can touch the body of books by night or by day, and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when they touch my body back again,
<BR>When a university course convinces like a slumbering woman
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and child convince,
<BR>When the minted gold in the vault smiles like the night-
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; watchman's daughter,
<BR>When warrantee deeds loafe in chairs opposite and are my
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; friendly companions,
<BR>I intend to reach them my hand, and make as much of them as
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do of men and women like you.
