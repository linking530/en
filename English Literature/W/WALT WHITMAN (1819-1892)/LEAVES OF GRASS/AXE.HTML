<P>W<FONT SIZE=-1>EAPON</FONT> shapely, naked, wan,
<BR>Head from the mother's bowels drawn,
<BR>Wooded flesh and metal bone, limb only one and lip only one,
<BR>Gray-blue leaf by red-heat grown, helve produced from a little
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seed sown,
<BR>Resting the grass amid and upon,
<BR>To be lean'd and to lean on.

<P>&nbsp;Strong shapes and attributes of strong shapes, masculine trades,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sights and sounds,
<BR>Long varied train of an emblem, dabs of music,
<BR>Fingers of the organist skipping staccato over the keys of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; great organ.

<P>Welcome are all earth's lands, each for its kind,
<BR>Welcome are lands of pine and oak,

<P>&nbsp;Welcome are lands of the lemon and fig,

<BR>Welcome are lands of wheat and maize, welcome those of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grape,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sweet potato,

<BR>Welcome the rich borders of rivers, table-lands, openings,
<BR>Welcome the measureless grazing-lands, welcome the teeming soil
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of orchards, flax, honey, hemp;
<BR>Welcome just as much the other more hard-faced lands,
<BR>Lands rich as lands of gold or wheat and fruit lands,
<BR>Lands of mines, lands of the manly and rugged ores,
<BR>Lands of coal, copper, lead, tin, zinc,
<BR>Lands of iron&amp;emdash;lands of the make of the axe.

<P>The log at the wood-pile, the axe supported by it,
<BR>The sylvan hut, the vine over the doorway, the space clear'd
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for a garden,
<BR>The irregular tapping of rain down on the leaves after the storm
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is lull'd,
<BR>The wailing and moaning at intervals, the thought of the sea,
<BR>The thought of ships struck in the storm and put on their beam
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ends, and the cutting away of masts,
<BR>The sentiment of the huge timbers of old-fashion'd houses and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; barns,
<BR>The remember'd print or narrative, the voyage at a venture of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; men, families, goods,
<BR>The disembarkation, the founding of a new city,
<BR>The voyage of those who sought a New England and found it,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the outset anywhere,
<BR>The settlements of the Arkansas, Colorado, Ottawa, Willamette,
<BR>The slow progress, the scant fare, the axe, rifle, saddle-bags;
<BR>The beauty of all adventurous and daring persons,
<BR>The beauty of wood-boys and wood-men with their clear
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; untrimm'd faces,

<P>&nbsp;The beauty of independence, departure, actions that rely on
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; themselves,
<BR>The American contempt for statutes and ceremonies, the boundless
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; impatience of restraint,
<BR>The loose drift of character, the inkling through random types,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the solidification;
<BR>The butcher in the slaughter-house, the hands aboard schooners and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sloops, the raftsmen, the pioneer,
<BR>Lumbermen in their winter camp, daybreak in the woods, stripes of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; snow on the limbs of trees, the occasional
snapping,
<BR>The glad clear sound of one's own voice, the merry song, the natural
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; life of the woods, the strong day's work,
<BR>The blazing fire at night, the sweet taste of supper, the talk, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bed of hemlock-boughs and the bear-skin;
<BR>The house-builder at work in cities or anywhere,
<BR>The preparatory jointing, squaring, sawing, mortising,
<BR>The hoist-up of beams, the push of them in their places, laying them
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; regular,
<BR>Setting the studs by their tenons in the mortises according as
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they were prepared,
<BR>The blows of mallets and hammers, the attitudes of the men, their
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; curv'd limbs,
<BR>Bending, standing, astride the beams, driving in pins, holding on
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by posts and braces,
<BR>The hook'd arm over the plate, the other arm wielding the axe,
<BR>The floor-men forcing the planks close to be nail'd,
<BR>Their postures bringing their weapons downward on the bearers,
<BR>The echoes resounding through the vacant building;
<BR>The huge storehouse carried up in the city well under way,
<BR>The six framing-men, two in the middle and two at each end, carefully
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bearing on their shoulders a heavy stick for
a cross-beam,
<BR>The crowded line of masons with trowels in their right hands rapidly
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; laying the long side-wall, two hundred feet
from front to rear,
<BR>The flexible rise and fall of backs, the continual click of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trowels striking the bricks,

<P>&nbsp;The bricks one after another each laid so workmanlike in its place,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and set with a knock of the trowel-handle,
<BR>The piles of materials, the mortar on the mortar-boards, and the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; steady replenishing by the hod-men;
<BR>Spar-makers in the spar-yard, the swarming row of well-grown
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; apprentices,
<BR>The swing of their axes on the square-hew'd log shaping it toward
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the shape of a mast,
<BR>The brisk short crackle of the steel driven slantingly into the pine,
<BR>The butter-color'd chips flying off in great flakes and slivers,
<BR>The limber motion of brawny young arms and hips in easy
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; costumes,
<BR>The constructor of wharves, bridges, piers, bulk-heads, floats,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stays against the sea;
<BR>The city fireman, the fire that suddenly bursts forth in the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; close-pack'd square,
<BR>The arriving engines, the hoarse shouts, the nimble stepping and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; daring,
<BR>The strong command through the fire-trumpets, the falling in line,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the rise and fall of the arms forcing the
water,
<BR>The slender, spasmic, blue-white jets, the bringing to bear of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hooks and ladders and their execution,
<BR>The crash and cut away of connecting wood-work, or through
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; floors if the fire smoulders under them,
<BR>The crowd with their lit faces watching, the glare and dense
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shadows;
<BR>The forger at his forge-furnace and the user of iron after him,
<BR>The maker of the axe large and small, and the welder and temperer,
<BR>The chooser breathing his breath on the cold steel and trying the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; edge with his thumb,
<BR>The one who clean-shapes the handle and sets it firmly in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the socket;
<BR>The shadowy processions of the portraits of the past users also,
<BR>The primal patient mechanics, the architects and engineers,
<BR>The far-off Assyrian edifice and Mizra edifice,
<BR>The Roman lictors preceding the consuls,
<BR>The antique European warrior with his axe in combat,

<P>&nbsp;The uplifted arm, the clatter of blows on the helmeted head,
<BR>The death-howl, the limpsy tumbling body, the rush of friend
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and foe thither,
<BR>The siege of revolted lieges determin'd for liberty,
<BR>The summons to surrender, the battering at castle gates, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; truce and parley,
<BR>The sack of an old city in its time,
<BR>The bursting in of mercenaries and bigots tumultuously and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; disorderly,
<BR>Roar, flames, blood, drunkenness, madness,
<BR>Goods freely rifled from houses and temples, screams of women
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the gripe of brigands,
<BR>Craft and thievery of camp-followers, men running, old persons
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; despairing,
<BR>The hell of war, the cruelties of creeds,
<BR>The list of all executive deeds and words just or unjust,
<BR>The power of personality just or unjust.

<P>Muscle and pluck forever!
<BR>What invigorates life invigorates death,
<BR>And the dead advance as much as the living advance,
<BR>And the future is no more uncertain than the present,
<BR>For the roughness of the earth and of man encloses as
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; much as the delicatesse of the earth and of
man,
<BR>And nothing endures but personal qualities.

<P>&nbsp;What do you think endures?
<BR>Do you think a great city endures?
<BR>Or a teeming manufacturing state? or a prepared constitution?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or the best built steamships?
<BR>Or hotels of granite and iron? or any chef-d' oeuvres of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; engineering, forts, armaments?

<P>&nbsp;Away! these are not to be cherish'd for themselves,
<BR>They fill their hour, the dancers dance, the musicians play
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for them,
<BR>The show passes, all does well enough of course,
<BR>All does very well till one flash of defiance.

<P>&nbsp;A great city is that which has the greatest men and women,
<BR>If it be a few ragged huts it is still the greatest city in the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whole world.

<P>&nbsp;
<CENTER>5</CENTER>


<P>The place where a great city stands is not the place of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stretch'd wharves, docks, manufactures, deposits
of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; produce merely,
<BR>Nor the place of ceaseless salutes of new-comers or the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; anchor-lifters of the departing,
<BR>Nor the place of the tallest and costliest buildings or shops
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; selling goods from the rest of the earth,
<BR>Nor the place of the best libraries and schools, nor the place
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where money is plentiest,
<BR>Nor the place of the most numerous population.

<P>&nbsp;Where the city stands with the brawniest breed of orators
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and bards,
<BR>Where the city stands that is belov'd by these, and loves them
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in return and understands them,
<BR>Where no monuments exist to heroes but in the common
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; words and deeds,
<BR>Where thrift is in its place, and prudence is in its place,
<BR>Where the men and women think lightly of the laws,
<BR>Where the slave ceases, and the master of slaves ceases,
<BR>Where the populace rise at once against the never-ending
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; audacity of elected persons,
<BR>Where fierce men and women pour forth as the sea to the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whistle of death pours its sweeping and unript
waves,
<BR>Where outside authority enters always after the precedence of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inside authority,
<BR>Where the citizen is always the head and ideal, and President,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mayor, Governor and what not, are agents for
pay,
<BR>Where children are taught to be laws to themselves, and to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; depend on themselves,
<BR>Where equanimity is illustrated in affairs,
<BR>Where speculations on the soul are encouraged,
<BR>Where women walk in public processions in the streets the same
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as the men,

<P>&nbsp;Where they enter the public assembly and take places the same
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as the men;
<BR>Where the city of the faithfulest friends stands,
<BR>Where the city of the cleanliness of the sexes stands,
<BR>Where the city of the healthiest fathers stands,
<BR>Where the city of the best-bodied mothers stands,
<BR>There the great city stands.

<P>How beggarly appear arguments before a defiant deed!
<BR>How the floridness of the materials of cities shrivels before
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a man's or woman's look!

<P>&nbsp;All waits or goes by default till a strong being appears;
<BR>A strong being is the proof of the race and of the ability of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the universe,
<BR>When he or she appears materials are overaw'd,
<BR>The dispute on the soul stops,
<BR>The old customs and phrases are confronted, turn'd back,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or laid away.

<P>&nbsp;What is your money-making now? what can it do now?
<BR>What is your respectability now?
<BR>What are your theology, tuition, society, traditions, statute-
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; books, now?
<BR>Where are your jibes of being now?
<BR>Where are your cavils about the soul now?

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hammers-men are at hand with their tongs and
hammers,
<BR>What always served and always serves is at hand.

<P>&nbsp;Than this nothing has better served, it has served all,
<BR>Served the fluent-tongued and subtle-sensed Greek, and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long ere the Greek,
<BR>Served in building the buildings that last longer than any,

<P>&nbsp;Served the Hebrew, the Persian, the most ancient Hindustanee,
<BR>Served the mound-raiser on the Mississippi, served those whose
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; relics remain in Central America,
<BR>Served Albic temples in woods or on plains, with unhewn pillars
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the druids,
<BR>Served the artificial clefts, vast, high, silent, on the snow-cover'd
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hills of Scandinavia,
<BR>Served those who time out of mind made on the granite walls
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rough sketches of the sun, moon, stars, ships,
ocean waves,
<BR>Served the paths of the irruptions of the Goths, served the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pastoral tribes and nomads,
<BR>Served the long distant Kelt, served the hardy pirates of the Baltic,
<BR>Served before any of those the venerable and harmless men of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ethiopia,
<BR>Served the making of helms for the galleys of pleasure and the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; making of those for war,
<BR>Served all great works on land and all great works on the sea,
<BR>For the mediaeval ages and before the mediaeval ages,
<BR>Served not the living only then as now, but served the dead.

<P>I see the European headsman,
<BR>He stands mask'd, clothed in red, with huge legs and strong
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; naked arms,
<BR>And leans on a ponderous axe.

<P>&nbsp;(Whom have you slaughter'd lately European headsman?
<BR>Whose is that blood upon you so wet and sticky?)

<P>&nbsp;I see the clear sunsets of the martyrs,
<BR>I see from the scaffolds the descending ghosts,
<BR>Ghosts of dead lords, uncrown'd ladies, impeach'd ministers,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rejected kings,
<BR>Rivals, traitors, poisoners, disgraced chieftains and the rest.

<P>&nbsp;I see those who in any land have died for the good cause,
<BR>The seed is spare, nevertheless the crop shall never run out,

<P>&nbsp;(Mind you O foreign kings, O priests, the crop shall never
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; run out.)

<P>&nbsp;I see the blood wash'd entirely away from the axe,
<BR>Both blade and helve are clean,
<BR>They spirt no more the blood of European nobles, they clasp
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no more the necks of queens.

<P>&nbsp;I see the headsman withdraw and become useless,
<BR>I see the scaffold untrodden and mouldy, I see no longer any
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; axe upon it,
<BR>I see the mighty and friendly emblem of the power of my own
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; race, the newest, largest race.

<BR>Dwellers along the St. Lawrence, or north in Kanada, or down
