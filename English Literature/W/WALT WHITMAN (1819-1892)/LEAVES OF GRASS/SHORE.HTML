A Nation announcing itself,
<BR>I myself make the only growth by which I can be appreciated,
<BR>I reject none, accept all, then reproduce all in my own forms.

<P>&nbsp;A breed whose proof is in time and deeds,
<BR>What we are we are, nativity is answer enough to objections,
<BR>We wield ourselves as a weapon is wielded,
<BR>We are powerful and tremendous in ourselves,
<BR>We are executive in ourselves, we are sufficient in the variety
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of ourselves,
<BR>We are the most beautiful to ourselves and in ourselves,
<BR>We stand self-pois'd in the middle, branching thence over the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; world,
<BR>From Missouri, Nebraska, or Kansas, laughing attacks to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scorn.
<BR>Nothing is sinful to us outside of ourselves,
<BR>Whatever appears, whatever does not appear, we are beautiful
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or sinful in ourselves only.

<P>&nbsp;(O Mother&amp;emdash;O Sisters dear!
<BR>If we are lost, no victor else has destroy'd us,
<BR>It is by ourselves we go down to eternal night.)

Ages, precedents, have long been accumulating undirected
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; materials,
<BR>America brings builders, and brings its own styles.

<P>&nbsp;The immortal poets of Asia and Europe have done their
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work and pass'd to other spheres,
<BR>A work remains, the work of surpassing all they have done.

<P>&nbsp;America, curious toward foreign characters, stands by its
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; own at all hazards,
<BR>Stands removed, spacious, composite, sound, initiates the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; true use of precedents,
<BR>Does not repel them or the past or what they have produced
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under their forms,
<BR>Takes the lesson with calmness, perceives the corpse slowly
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; borne from the house,
<BR>Perceives that it waits a little while in the door, that it was
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fittest for its days,
<BR>That its life has descended to the stalwart and well-shaped
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heir who approaches,
<BR>And that he shall be fittest for his days.

<P>&nbsp;Any period one nation must lead,
<BR>One land must be the promise and reliance of the future.

<P>&nbsp;These States are the amplest poem,
<BR>Here is not merely a nation but a teeming Nation of nations,
<BR>Here the doings of men correspond with the broadcast
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doings of the day and night,

<P>&nbsp;Here is what moves in magnificent masses careless of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; particulars,
<BR>Here are the roughs, beards, friendliness, combativeness, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; soul loves,
<BR>Here the flowing trains, here the crowds, equality, diversity,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the soul loves.

<BR>His first parts substances, earth, water, animals, trees,

<BR>Used to dispense with other lands, incarnating this land,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with incomparable love,
<BR>Plunging his seminal muscle into its merits and demerits,
<BR>Making its cities, beginnings, events, diversities, wars, vocal
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in him,

<BR>Mississippi with yearly freshets and changing chutes, Columbia,

<BR>Off him pasturage sweet and natural as savanna, upland,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prairie,

eagle,

<BR>The haughty defiance of the Year One, war, peace, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; formation of the Constitution,
<BR>The separate States, the simple elastic scheme, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; immigrants,
<BR>The Union always swarming with blatherers and always sure

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the gestation of new States,
<BR>Congress convening every Twelfth-month, the members duly
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; coming up from the uttermost parts,
<BR>Surrounding the noble character of mechanics and farmers,

<BR>Responding their manners, speech, dress, friendships,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the gait they have of persons who never knew
how it felt to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stand in the presence of superiors,
<BR>The freshness and candor of their physiognomy,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the copiousness and decision of their phrenology,

I listened to the Phantom by Ontario's shore,
<BR>I heard the voice arising demanding bards,
<BR>By them all native and grand, by them alone can these States
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be fused into the compact organism of a Nation.

<P>&nbsp;To hold men together by paper and seal or by compulsion is
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no account,
<BR>That only holds men together which aggregates all in a living
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; principle, as the hold of the limbs of the
body or the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fibres of plants.

<P>&nbsp;Of all races and eras these States with veins full of poetica
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stuff most need poets, and are to have the
greatest, and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; use them the greatest,
<BR>Their Presidents shall not be their common referee so much
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as their poets shall.

<P>&nbsp;(Soul of love and tongue of fire!
<BR>Eye to pierce the deepest deeps and sweep the world!
<BR>Ah Mother, prolific and full in all besides, yet how long
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; barren, barren?)

Of these States the poet is the equable man,
<BR>Not in him but off from him things are grotesque, eccentric,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fail of their full returns,
<BR>Nothing out of its place is good, nothing in its place is bad,
<BR>He bestows on every object or quality its fit proportion,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; neither more nor less,
<BR>He is the arbiter of the diverse, he is the key,
<BR>He is the equalizer of his age and land,
<BR>He supplies what wants supplying, he checks what wants
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; checking,

<P>&nbsp;In peace out of him speaks the spirit of peace, large, rich,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thrifty, building populous towns, encouraging
agriculture,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arts, commerce, lighting the study of man,
the soul,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; health, immortality, government,
<BR>In war he is the best backer of the war, he fetches artillery
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as good as the engineer's, he can make every
word he
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; speaks draw blood,
<BR>The years straying toward infidelity he withholds by his
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; steady faith,
<BR>He is no arguer, he is judgment, (Nature accepts him
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; absolutely,)
<BR>He judges not as the judge judges but as the sun falling round
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a helpless thing,
<BR>As he sees the farthest he has the most faith,
<BR>His thoughts are the hymns of the praise of things,
<BR>In the dispute on God and eternity he is silent,
<BR>He sees eternity less like a play with a prologue and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; denouement,
<BR>He sees eternity in men and women, he does not see men and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; women as dreams or dots.

<P>&nbsp;For the great Idea, the idea of perfect and free individuals,
<BR>For that, the bard walks in advance, leader of leaders,
<BR>The attitude of him cheers up slaves and horrifies foreign
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; despots.

<P>&nbsp;Without extinction is Liberty, without retrograde is Equality,
<BR>They live in the feelings of young men and the best women,
<BR>(Not for nothing have the indomitable heads of the earth
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; been always ready to fall for Liberty.)

<BR>The flag of peace quick-folded, and instead the flag we know,
<BR>Warlike flag of the great Idea.

<P>&nbsp;(Angry cloth I saw there leaping!
<BR>I stand again in leaden rain your flapping folds saluting,
<BR>I sing you over all, flying beckoning through the fight&amp;emdash;O
the

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; incessant from the line,
<BR>Hark, the ringing word <I>Charge</I>!&amp;emdash;now the tussle and
the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; furious maddening yells,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sea, the bodies of men, womanhood, amativeness,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heroic angers, teach?
<BR>Have you sped through fleeting customs, popularities?

<P>&nbsp;What is this you bring my America?

old
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cause in it?
<BR>Has it not dangled long at the heels of the poets, politicians,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; literats, of enemies' lands?

<BR>Does it answer universal needs? will it improve manners?
<BR>Does it sound with trumpet-voice the proud victory of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Union in that secession war?
<BR>Can your performance face the open fields and the seaside?
<BR>Will it absorb into me as I absorb food, air, to appear again
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in my strength, gait, face?
<BR>Have real employments contributed to it? original makers,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not mere amanuenses?
<BR>Does it meet modern discoveries, calibres, facts, face to face?
<BR>What does it mean to American persons, progresses, cities?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chicago, Kanada, Arkansas?
<BR>Does it see behind the apparent custodians the real custodians
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; standing, menacing, silent, the mechanics,
Manhattanese,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Western men, Southerners, significant alike

I swear I begin to see the meaning of these things,
<BR>It is not the earth, it is not America who is so great,
<BR>It is I who am great or to be great, it is You up there, or any
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one,
<BR>It is to walk rapidly through civilizations, governments,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; theories,
<BR>Through poems, pageants, shows, to form individuals.

<P>&nbsp;Underneath all, individuals,
<BR>I swear nothing is good to me now that ignores individuals,
<BR>The American compact is altogether with individuals,
<BR>The only government is that which makes minute of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; individuals,
<BR>The whole theory of the universe is directed unerringly to one
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; single individual&amp;emdash;namely to You.

<P>&nbsp;(Mother! with subtle sense severe, with the naked sword in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your hand,
<BR>I saw you at last refuse to treat but directly with individuals.)

Underneath all, Nativity,
<BR>I swear I will stand by my own nativity, pious or impious so
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be it;
<BR>I swear I am charm'd with nothing except nativity,
<BR>Men, women, cities, nations, are only beautiful from nativity.

<P>&nbsp;Underneath all is the Expression of love for men and women,
<BR>(I swear I have seen enough of mean and impotent modes of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; expressing love for men and women,
<BR>After this day I take my own modes of expressing love for
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; men and women.)

<P>&nbsp;I swear I will have each quality of my race in myself,
<BR>(Talk as you like, he only suits these States whose manners
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; favor the audacity and sublime turbulence
of the States.)

<P>&nbsp;Underneath the lessons of things, spirits, Nature, governments,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ownerships, I swear I perceive other lessons,

<P>&nbsp;Underneath all to me is myself, to you yourself, (the same
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; monotonous old song.)

O I see flashing that this America is only you and me,
<BR>Its power, weapons, testimony, are you and me,
<BR>Its crimes, lies, thefts, defections, are you and me,
<BR>Its Congress is you and me, the officers, capitols, armies,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ships, are you and me,
<BR>Its endless gestations of new States are you and me,
<BR>The war, (that war so bloody and grim, the war I will hence-forth
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; forget), was you and me,
<BR>Natural and artificial are you and me,
<BR>Freedom, language, poems, employments, are you and me,
<BR>Past, present, future, are you and me.

<P>&nbsp;I dare not shirk any part of myself,
<BR>Not any part of America good or bad,
<BR>Not to build for that which builds for mankind,
<BR>Not to balance ranks, complexions, creeds, and the sexes,
<BR>Not to justify science nor the march of equality,
<BR>Nor to feed the arrogant blood of the brawn belov'd of time.

<P>&nbsp;I am for those that have never been master'd,
<BR>For men and women whose tempers have never been
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; master'd,
<BR>For those whom laws, theories, conventions, can never
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; master.

<P>&nbsp;I am for those who walk abreast with the whole earth,
<BR>Who inaugurate one to inaugurate all.

<P>&nbsp;I will not be outfaced by irrational things,
<BR>I will penetrate what it is in them that is sarcastic upon me,
<BR>I will make cities and civilizations defer to me,
<BR>This is what I have learnt from America&amp;emdash;it is the amount,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and it I teach again.

<P>&nbsp;(Democracy, while weapons were everywhere aim'd at your
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; breast,

I will confront these shows of the day and night,

<BR>I will see if I am to be less generous than they,
<BR>I will see if I have no meaning, while the houses and ships
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have meaning,
<BR>I will see if the fishes and birds are to be enough for themselves,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and I am not to be enough for myself.

<P>&nbsp;I match my spirit against yours you orbs, growths, mountains,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; brutes,
<BR>Copious as you are I absorb you all in myself, and become
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the master myself,
<BR>America isolated yet embodying all, what is it finally except
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; myself?
<BR>These States, what are they except myself?

<P>&nbsp;I know now why the earth is gross, tantalizing, wicked, it is
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for my sake,
<BR>I take you specially to be mine, you terrible, rude forms.

<P>&nbsp;(Mother, bend down, bend close to me your face,
<BR>I know not what these plots and wards and deferments are for,
<BR>I know not fruition's success, but I know that through war
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and crime your work goes on, and must yet
go on.)

Thus by blue Ontario's shore,
<BR>While the winds fann'd me and the waves came trooping
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; toward me,
<BR>I thrill'd with the power's pulsations, and the charm of my
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; theme was upon me,
<BR>Till the tissues that held me parted their ties upon me.

<P>&nbsp;And I saw the free souls of poets,
<BR>The loftiest bards of past ages strode before me,
<BR>Strange large men, long unwaked, undisclosed, were disclosed
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to me.

O my rapt verse, my call, mock me not!
<BR>Not for the bards of the past, not to invoke them have I
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; launch'd you forth,
<BR>Not to call even those lofty bards here by Ontario's shores,
<BR>Have I sung so capricious and loud my savage song.

<P>&nbsp;Bards for my own land only I invoke,
<BR>(For the war, the war is over, the field is clear'd,)
<BR>Till they strike up marches henceforth triumphant and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; onward,
<BR>To cheer O Mother your boundless expectant soul.

<P>&nbsp;Bards of the great Idea! bards of the peaceful inventions!
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (for the war, the war is over!)
<BR>Yet bards of latent armies, a million soldiers waiting
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; everready,
<BR>Bards with songs as from burning coals or the lightning's
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fork'd stripes!
<BR>Ample Ohio's, Kanada's bards&amp;emdash;bards of California! inland
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bards&amp;emdash;bards of the war!
<BR>You by my charm I invoke.
