AS THE TIME DRAWS NIGH</H2></CENTER>
A<FONT SIZE=-1>S</FONT> the time draws nigh glooming a cloud,
<BR>A dread beyond of I know not what darkens me.

<P>&nbsp;I shall go forth,
<BR>I shall traverse the States awhile, but I cannot tell whither or
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how long,
<BR>Perhaps soon some day or night while I am singing my voice
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will suddenly cease.

<P>&nbsp;O book, O chants! must all then amount to but this?
<BR>Must we barely arrive at this beginning of us?&amp;emdash;and yet it
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is enough, O soul;
<BR>O soul, we have positively appear'd&amp;emdash;that is enough.

YEARS OF THE MODERN</H2></CENTER>
Y<FONT SIZE=-1>EARS</FONT> of the modern! years of the unperform'd!
<BR>Your horizon rises, I see it parting away for more august
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dramas,
<BR>I see not America only, not only Liberty's nation but other
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nations preparing,
<BR>I see tremendous entrances and exits, new combinations, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; solidarity of races,
<BR>I see that force advancing with irresistible power on the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; world's stage,
<BR>(Have the old forces, the old wars, played their parts? are the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; acts suitable to them closed?)
<BR>I see Freedom, completely arm'd and victorious and very
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; haughty, with Law on one side and Peace on
the other,
<BR>A stupendous trio all issuing forth against the idea of caste;

<P>&nbsp;What historic denouements are these we so rapidly approach?
<BR>I see men marching and countermarching by swift millions,
<BR>I see the frontiers and boundaries of the old aristocracies
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; broken,
<BR>I see the landmarks of European kings removed,
<BR>I see this day the People beginning their landmarks, (all others
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; give way;)
<BR>Never were such sharp questions ask'd as this day,
<BR>Never was average man, his soul, more energetic, more like a
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God,
<BR>Lo, how he urges and urges, leaving the masses no rest!
<BR>His daring foot is on land and sea everywhere, he colonizes
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Pacific, the archipelagoes,
<BR>With the steamship, the electric telegraph, the newspaper,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the wholesale engines of war,
<BR>With these and the world-spreading factories he interlinks all
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; geography, all lands;
<BR>What whispers are these O lands, running ahead of you,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; passing under the seas?
<BR>Are all nations communing? is there going to be but one
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heart to the globe?
<BR>Is humanity forming en-masse? for lo, tyrants tremble,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; crowns grow dim,
<BR>The earth, restive, confronts a new era, perhaps a general
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; divine war,
<BR>No one knows what will happen next, such portents fill the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; days and nights;
<BR>Years prophetical! the space ahead as I walk, as I vainly try
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to pierce it, is full of phantoms,
<BR>Unborn deeds, things soon to be, project their shapes around
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me,
<BR>This incredible rush and heat, this strange ecstatic fever of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dreams O years!
<BR>Your dreams O years, how they penetrate through me! (I
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; know not whether I sleep or wake;)
<BR>The perform'd America and Europe grow dim, retiring in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shadow behind me,
<BR>The unperform'd, more gigantic than ever, advance, advance

ASHES OF SOLDIERS</H2></CENTER>
A<FONT SIZE=-1>SHES</FONT> of soldiers South or North,
<BR>As I muse retrospective murmuring a chant in thought,
<BR>The war resumes, again to my sense your shapes,
<BR>And again the advance of the armies.

<P>&nbsp;Noiseless as mists and vapors,
<BR>From their graves in the trenches ascending,
<BR>From cemeteries all through Virginia and Tennessee,
<BR>From every point of the compass out of the countless graves,
<BR>In wafted clouds, in myriads large, or squads of twos or
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; threes or single ones they come,
<BR>And silently gather round me.

<P>&nbsp;Now sound no note O trumpeters,
<BR>Not at the head of my cavalry parading on spirited horses,
<BR>With sabres drawn and glistening, and carbines by their
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thighs, (ah my brave horsemen!
<BR>My handsome tan-faced horsemen! what life, what joy and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pride,
<BR>With all the perils were yours.)

<P>&nbsp;Nor you drummers, neither at reveill&eacute; at dawn,
<BR>Nor the long roll alarming the camp, nor even the muffled
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beat for a burial,
<BR>Nothing from you this time O drummers bearing my warlil
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drums.

<P>&nbsp;But aside from these and the marts of wealth and the crowded
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; promenade,
<BR>Admitting around me comrades close unseen by the rest and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; voiceless,
<BR>The slain elate and alive again, the dust and debris alive,
<BR>I chant this chant of my silent soul in the name of all dead
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; soldiers.

<P>&nbsp;Faces so pale with wondrous eyes, very dear, gather closer
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yet,
<BR>Draw close, but speak not.

<P>&nbsp;Phantoms of countless lost,
<BR>Invisible to the rest henceforth become my companions,
<BR>Follow me ever &amp;emdash; desert me not while I live.

<P>&nbsp;Sweet are the blooming cheeks of the living &amp;emdash; sweet
are
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the musical voices sounding,
<BR>But sweet, ah sweet, are the dead with their silent eyes.

<P>&nbsp;Dearest comrades, all is over and long gone,
<BR>But love is not over &amp;emdash; and what love, O comrades
<BR>Perfume from battle-fields rising, up from the foetor arising.

<P>&nbsp;Perfume therefore my chant, O love, immortal love,
<BR>Give me to bathe the memories of all dead soldiers,
<BR>Shroud them, embalm them, cover them all over with tender
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pride.

<P>&nbsp;Perfume all &amp;emdash; make all wholesome,
<BR>Make these ashes to nourish and blossom,
<BR>O love, solve all, fructify all with the last chemistry.

<P>&nbsp;Give me exhaustless, make me a fountain,
<BR>That I exhale love from me wherever I go like a moist
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; perennial dew,
<BR>For the ashes of all dead soldiers South or North.

<P>O<FONT SIZE=-1>F</FONT> these years I sing,
<BR>How they pass and have pass'd through convuls'd pains, as
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; through parturitions,
<BR>How America illustrates birth, muscular youth, the promise,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the sure fulfilment, the absolute success,
despite of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; people &amp;emdash; illustrates evil as well
as good,
<BR>The vehement struggle so fierce for unity in one's -self;

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; myths, obedience, compulsion, and to infidelity,
<BR>How few see the arrived models, the athletes, the Western
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; States, or see freedom or spirituality, or
hold any faith
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in results,

<P>&nbsp;(But I see the athletes, and I see the results of the war glorious
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and inevitable, and they again leading to
other results.)

<P>&nbsp;How the great cities appear &amp;emdash; how the Democratic
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; masses, turbulent, wilful, as I love them,
<BR>How the whirl, the contest, the wrestle of evil with good, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sounding and resounding, keep on and on,
<BR>How society waits unform'd, and is for a while between things
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ended and things begun,
<BR>How America is the continent of glories, and of the triumph
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of freedom and of the Democracies, and of
the fruits of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; society, and of all that is begun,
<BR>And how the States are complete in themselves &amp;emdash;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and how all triumphs and glories are complete
in themselves,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to lead onward,
<BR>And how these of mine and of the States will in their turn be
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; convuls'd, and serve other parturitions and
transitions,
<BR>And how all people, sights, combinations, the democratic
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; masses too, serve &amp;emdash; and how every
fact, and war
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; itself, with all its horrors, serves,
<BR>And how now or at any time each serves the exquisite
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; transition of death.

<P>&nbsp;Open mouth of my soul uttering gladness,

<BR>To be this incredible God I am!
<BR>To have gone forth among other Gods, these men and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; women I love.

<P>&nbsp;Wonderful how I celebrate you and myself!

SO LONG!</H2></CENTER>
To conclude, I announce what comes after me.

<P>&nbsp;I remember I said before my leaves sprang at all,
<BR>I would raise my voice jocund and strong with reference to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; consummations.

<P>&nbsp;When America does what was promis'd,
<BR>When through these States walk a hundred millions of superb
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; persons,
<BR>When the rest part away for superb persons and contribute
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to them,
<BR>When breeds of the most perfect mothers denote America,
<BR>Then to me and mine our due fruition.

<P>&nbsp;I have press'd through in my own right,
<BR>I have sung the body and the soul, war and peace have I
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sung, and the songs of life and death,
<BR>And the songs of birth, and shown that there are many
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; births.

<P>&nbsp;I have offer'd my style to every one, I have journey'd with
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; confident step;
<BR>While my pleasure is yet at the full I whisper <I>So long</I>!
<BR>And take the young woman's hand and the young man's
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hand for the last time.

<P>&nbsp;I announce natural persons to arise,
<BR>I announce justice triumphant,
<BR>I announce uncompromising liberty and equality,
<BR>I announce the justification of candor and the justification
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of pride.

<P>&nbsp;I announce that the identity of these States is a single identity
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only,
<BR>I announce the Union more and more compact, indissoluble,
<BR>I announce splendors and majesties to make all the previous
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; politics of the earth insignificant.

<P>&nbsp;I announce adhesiveness, I say it shall be limitless, un-
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loosen'd,
<BR>I say you shall yet find the friend you were looking for.

<P>&nbsp;I announce a man or woman coming, perhaps you are the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one, (<I>So long</I>!)
<BR>I announce the great individual, fluid as Nature, chaste,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; affectionate, compassionate, fully arm'd.

<P>&nbsp;I announce a life that shall be copious, vehement, spiritual,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bold,
<BR>I announce an end that shall lightly and joyfully meet its
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; translation.

<P>&nbsp;I announce myriads of youths, beautiful, gigantic, sweet-
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blooded,
<BR>I announce a race of splendid and savage old men.

<P>&nbsp;O thicker and faster &amp;emdash; (<I>So long</I>!)
<BR>O crowding too close upon me,
<BR>I foresee too much, it means more than I thought,
<BR>It appears to me I am dying.

<P>&nbsp;Hasten throat and sound your last,
<BR>Salute me &amp;emdash; salute the days once more. Peal the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; old cry once more.

<P>&nbsp;Screaming electric, the atmosphere using,
<BR>At random glancing, each as I notice absorbing,
<BR>Swiftly on, but a little while alighting,
<BR>Curious envelop'd messages delivering,
<BR>Sparkles hot, seed ethereal down in the dirt dropping,
<BR>Myself unknowing, my commission obeying, to question
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it never daring,
<BR>To ages and ages yet the growth of the seed leaving,

<P>&nbsp;To troops out of the war arising, they the tasks I have set
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; promulging,
<BR>To women certain whispers of myself bequeathing, their
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; affection me more clearly explaining,
<BR>To young men my problems offering &amp;emdash; no dallier
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I &amp;emdash; I the muscle of their brains
trying,
<BR>So I pass, a little time vocal, visible, contrary,
<BR>Afterward a melodious echo, passionately bent for, (death
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; making me really undying,)
<BR>The best of me then when no longer visible, for toward that
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been incessantly preparing.

<P>&nbsp;What is there more, that I lag and pause and crouch extended
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with unshut mouth?
<BR>Is there a single final farewell?

<P>&nbsp;My songs cease, I abandon them,
<BR>From behind the screen where I hid I advance personally
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; solely to you.

<P>&nbsp;Camerado, this is no book,
<BR>Who touches this touches a man,
<BR>(Is it night? are we here together alone?)
<BR>It is I you hold and who holds you,
<BR>I spring from the pages into your arms &amp;emdash; decease
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; calls me forth.

<P>&nbsp;O how your fingers drowse me,
<BR>Your breath falls around me like dew, your pulse lulls the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tympans of my ears,
<BR>I feel immerged from head to foot,
<BR>Delicious, enough.

<P>&nbsp;Enough O deed impromptu and secret,
<BR>Enough O gliding present &amp;emdash; enough O summ'd-
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; up past.

<P>&nbsp;Dear friend whoever you are take this kiss,
<BR>I give it especially to you, do not forget me,
<BR>I feel like one who has done work for the day to retire
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; awhile,
<BR>I receive now again of my many translations, from my
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; avataras ascending, while others doubtless
await me,

<P>&nbsp;An unknown sphere more real than I dream'd, more
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; direct, darts awakening rays about me, <I>So
long</I>!
<BR>Remember my words, I may again return,
<BR>I love you, I depart from materials,
<BR>I am as one disembodied, triumphant, dead.
