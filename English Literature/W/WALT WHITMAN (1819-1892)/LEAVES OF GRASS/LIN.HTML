W<FONT SIZE=-1>hen</FONT> lilacs last in the dooryard bloom'd,
<BR>And the great star early droop'd in the western sky in the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; night,
<BR>I mourn'd, and yet shall mourn with ever-returning spring.

<P>&nbsp;Ever-returning spring, trinity sure to me you bring,
<BR>Lilac blooming perennial and drooping star in the west,
<BR>And thought of him I love.

O powerful western fallen star!
<BR>O shades of night&amp;emdash;O moody, tearful night!
<BR>O great star disappear'd&amp;emdash;O the black murk that hides the
star!
<BR>O cruel hands that hold me powerless&amp;emdash;O helpless soul of
me!
<BR>O harsh surrounding cloud that will not free my soul.

In the dooryard fronting an old farm-house near the white-wash'd
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; palings,
<BR>Stands the lilac-bush tall-growing with heart-shaped leaves
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of rich green,
<BR>With many a pointed blossom rising delicate, with the perfume
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strong I love,
<BR>With every leaf a miracle&amp;emdash;and from this bush in the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dooryard,
<BR>With delicate-color'd blossoms and heart-shaped leaves of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rich green,
<BR>A spring with its flower I break.

In the swamp in secluded recesses,
<BR>A shy and hidden bird is warbling a song.

<P>&nbsp;Solitary the thrush,
<BR>The hermit withdrawn to himself, avoiding the settlements,
<BR>Sings by himself a song.

<P>&nbsp;Song of the bleeding throat,
<BR>Death's outlet song of life, (for well dear brother I know,
<BR>If thou wast not granted to sing thou would'st surely die.)

Over the breast of the spring, the land, amid cities,
<BR>Amid lanes and through old woods, where lately the violets
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; peep'd from the ground, spotting the gray
debris,
<BR>Amid the grass in the fields each side of the lanes, passing the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; endless grass,
<BR>Passing the yellow-spear'd wheat, every grain from its shroud
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the dark-brown fields uprisen,
<BR>Passing the apple-tree blows of white and pink in the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; orchards,
<BR>Carrying a corpse to where it shall rest in the grave,
<BR>Night and day journeys a coffin.

<CENTER></CENTER>

<CENTER>6</CENTER>
Coffin that passes through lanes and streets,
<BR>Through day and night with the great cloud darkening the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; land,
<BR>With the pomp of the inloop'd flags with the cities draped in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; black,
<BR>With the show of the States themselves as of crape-veil'd
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; women standing,
<BR>With processions long and winding and the flambeaus of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; night,
<BR>With the countless torches lit, with the silent sea of faces and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the unbared heads,
<BR>With the waiting depot, the arriving coffin, and the sombre
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; faces,
<BR>With dirges through the night, with the thousand voices
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rising strong and solemn,
<BR>With all the mournful voices of the dirges pour'd around the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; coffin,
<BR>The dim-lit churches and the shuddering organs&amp;emdash;where
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; amid these you journey,
<BR>With the tolling tolling bells' perpetual clang,
<BR>Here, coffin that slowly passes,
<BR>I give you my sprig of lilac.

(Nor for you, for one alone,
<BR>Blossoms and branches green to coffins all I bring,
<BR>For fresh as the morning, thus would I chant a song for you
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O sane and sacred death.

<P>&nbsp;All over bouquets of roses,
<BR>O death, I cover you over with roses and early lilies,
<BR>But mostly and now the lilac that blooms the first,
<BR>Copious I break, I break the sprigs from the bushes,
<BR>With loaded arms I come, pouring for you,
<BR>For you and the coffins all of you O death.)

<CENTER>8</CENTER>
O western orb sailing the heaven,
<BR>Now I know what you must have meant as a month since I
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; walk'd,
<BR>As I walk'd in silence the transparent shadowy night,
<BR>As I saw you had something to tell as you bent to me night
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; after night,
<BR>As you droop'd from the sky low down as if to my side,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (while the other stars all look'd on,)
<BR>As we wander'd together the solemn night, (for something I
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; know not what kept me from sleep,)
<BR>As the night advanced, and I saw on the rim of the west how
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; full you were of woe,
<BR>As I stood on the rising ground in the breeze in the cool
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; transparent night,
<BR>As I watch'd where you pass'd and was lost in the netherward
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; black of the night,
<BR>As my soul in its trouble dissatisfied sank, as where you sad
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; orb,
<BR>Concluded, dropt in the night, and was gone.

Sing on there in the swamp,
<BR>O singer bashful and tender, I hear your notes, I hear your
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; call,
<BR>I hear, I come presently, I understand you,
<BR>But a moment I linger, for the lustrous star has detain'd me,
<BR>The star my departing comrade holds and detains me.

O how shall I warble myself for the dead one there I loved?
<BR>And how shall I deck my song for the large sweet soul that
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has gone?
<BR>And what shall my perfume be for the grave of him I love?

<P>&nbsp;Sea-winds blown from east and west,
<BR>Blown from the Eastern sea and blown from the Western sea,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; till there on the prairies meeting,
<BR>These and with these and the breath of my chant,
<BR>I'll perfume the grave of him I love.

O what shall I hang on the chamber walls?
<BR>And what shall the pictures be that I hang on the walls,
<BR>To adorn the burial-house of him I love?

<P>&nbsp;Pictures of growing spring and farms and homes,
<BR>With the Fourth-month eve at sundown, and the gray smoke
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lucid and bright,
<BR>With floods of the yellow gold of the gorgeous, indolent,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sinking sun, burning, expanding the air,
<BR>With the fresh sweet herbage under foot, and the pale green
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; leaves of the trees prolific,
<BR>In the distance the flowing glaze, the breast of the river, with
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a wind-dapple here and there,
<BR>With ranging hills on the banks, with many a line against the sky,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and shadows,
<BR>And the city at hand with dwellings so dense, and stacks of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chimneys,
<BR>And all the scenes of life and the workshops, and the workmen

<P>&nbsp;Lo, the most excellent sun so calm and haughty,
<BR>The violet and purple morn with just-felt breezes,
<BR>The gentle soft-born measureless light,

<BR>Limitless out of the dusk, out of the cedars and pines.

<P>&nbsp;Sing on dearest brother, warble your reedy song,
<BR>Loud human song, with voice of uttermost woe.

<P>&nbsp;O liquid and free and tender!
<BR>O wild and loose to my soul&amp;emdash;O wondrous singer!
<BR>You only I hear&amp;emdash;yet the star holds me, (but will soon

Now while I sat in the day and look'd forth,
<BR>In the close of the day with its light and the fields of spring,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the farmers preparing their crops,
<BR>In the large unconscious scenery of my land with its lakes
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and forests,
<BR>In the heavenly aerial beauty, (after the perturb'd winds and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the storms,)
<BR>Under the arching heavens of the afternoon swift passing,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the voices of children and women,
<BR>The many-moving sea-tides, and I saw the ships how they sail'd,
<BR>And the summer approaching with richness, and the fields all
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; busy with labor,
<BR>And the infinite separate houses, how they all went on, each
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with its meals and minutia of daily usages,
<BR>And the streets how their throbbings throbb'd, and the cities
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pent&amp;emdash;lo, then and there,
<BR>Falling upon them all and among them all, enveloping me
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the rest,
<BR>Appear'd the cloud, appear'd the long black trail,
<BR>And I knew death, its thought, and the sacred knowledge of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; death.

<P>&nbsp;Then with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me,
<BR>And the thought of death close-walking the other side of me,
<BR>And I in the middle as with companions, and as holding the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hands of companions,
<BR>I fled forth to the hiding receiving night that talks not,
<BR>Down to the shores of the water, the path by the swamp in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the dimness,
<BR>To the solemn shadowy cedars and ghostly pines so still.

<P>&nbsp;And the singer so shy to the rest receiv'd me,
<BR>The gray-brown bird I know receiv'd us comrades three,
<BR>And he sang the carol of death, and a verse for him I love.

<P>&nbsp;From deep secluded recesses,
<BR>From the fragrant cedars and the ghostly pines so still,
<BR>Came the carol of the bird.

<P>&nbsp;And the charm of the carol rapt me,
<BR>As I held as if by their hands my comrades in the night,
<BR>And the voice of my spirit tallied the song of the bird.

<P>&nbsp;<I>Come lovely and soothing death</I>,
<BR><I>Undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving,</I>
<BR><I>In the day, in the night, to all, to each</I>,
<BR><I>Sooner or later delicate death</I>

<P>&nbsp;<I>Prais'd be the fathomless universe</I>,
<BR><I>For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious</I>,
<BR><I>And for love, sweet love&amp;emdash;but praise! praise! praise</I>!
<BR><I>For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding death</I>.

<P>&nbsp;<I>Dark mother always gliding near with soft feet</I>,
<BR><I>Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome</I>?
<BR><I>Then I chant it for thee, I glorify thee above all</I>,
<BR><I>I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, come</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unfalteringly</I>.

<P>&nbsp;<I>Approach strong deliveress</I>,
<BR><I>When it is so, when thou hast taken them I joyously sing the</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dead</I>,
<BR><I>Lost in the loving floating ocean of thee</I>,
<BR><I>Laved in the flood of thy bliss O death</I>.

<P>&nbsp;<I>From me to thee glad serenades</I>,
<BR><I>Dances for thee I propose saluting thee, adornments and</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; feastings for thee</I>,
<BR><I>And the sights of the open landscape and the high-spread sky</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are fitting</I>,
<BR><I>And life and the fields, and the huge and thoughtful night</I>.

<P>&nbsp;<I>The night in silence under many a star</I>,
<BR><I>The ocean shore and the husky whispering wave whose voice I</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; know</I>,
<BR><I>And the soul turning to thee O vast and well-veil'd death</I>,
<BR><I>And the body gratefully nestling close to thee</I>.

<P>&nbsp;<I>Over the tree-tops I float thee a song</I>,
<BR><I>Over the rising and sinking waves, over the myriad fields and the
prairies wide</I>,
<BR><I>Over the dense-pack'd cities all and the teeming wharves and</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ways</I>,

To the tally of my soul,
<BR>Loud and strong kept up the gray-brown bird,
<BR>With pure deliberate notes spreading filling the night.
<BR>Loud in the pines and cedars dim,
<BR>Clear in the freshness moist and the swamp-perfume,
<BR>And I with my comrades there in the night.

<P>&nbsp;While my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed,
<BR>As to long panoramas of visions.

<P>&nbsp;And I saw askant the armies,
<BR>I saw as in noiseless dreams hundreds of battle-flags,
<BR>Borne through the smoke of the battles and pier'd with
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; missiles I saw them,
<BR>And carried hither and yon through the smoke, and torn and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bloody,
<BR>And at last but a few shreds left on the staffs, (and all in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; silence,)
<BR>And the staffs all splinter'd and broken.

<P>&nbsp;I saw battle-corpses, myriads of them,
<BR>And the white skeletons of young men, I saw them,
<BR>I saw the debris and debris of all the slain soldiers of the war,
<BR>But I saw they were not as was thought,
<BR>They themselves were fully at rest, they suffer'd not,
<BR>The living remain'd and suffer'd, the mother suffer'd,
<BR>And the wife and the child and the musing comrade suffer'd,
<BR>And the armies that remain'd suffer'd.

Passing the visions, passing the night,
<BR>Passing, unloosing the hold of my comrades' hands,
<BR>Passing the song of the hermit bird and the tallying song of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my soul,
<BR>Victorious song, death's outlet song, yet varying ever-altering
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; song,
<BR>As low and wailing, yet clear the notes, rising and falling,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flooding the night,
<BR>Sadly sinking and fainting, as warning and warning, and yet
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; again bursting with joy,
<BR>Covering the earth and filling the spread of the heaven,
<BR>As that powerful psalm in the night I heard from recesses,

<P>&nbsp;Passing, I leave thee lilac with heart-shaped leaves,
<BR>I leave thee there in the door-yard, blooming, returning with
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spring.

<P>&nbsp;I cease from my song for thee,
<BR>From my gaze on thee in the west, fronting the west,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; communing with thee,
<BR>O comrade lustrous with silver face in the night.

<P>&nbsp;Yet each to keep and all, retrievements out of the night,
<BR>The song, the wondrous chant of the gray-brown bird,
<BR>And the tallying chant, the echo arous'd in my soul,
<BR>With the lustrous and drooping star with the countenance
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; full of woe,
<BR>With the holders holding my hand nearing the call of the bird,
<BR>Comrades mine and I in the midst, and their memory ever to keep,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the dead I loved so well,
<BR>For the sweetest, wisest soul of all my days and lands&amp;emdash;and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this for his dear sake,
<BR>Lilac and star and bird twined with the chant of my soul,
<BR>There in the fragrant pines and the cedars dusk and dim.
