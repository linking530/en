Over the Western sea hither from Niphon come,
<BR>Courteous, the swart-cheek'd two-sworded envoys,
<BR>Leaning back in their open barouches, bare-headed, impassive,
<BR>Ride to-day through Manhattan.
<BR>Libertad! I do not know whether others behold what I behold,
<BR>In the procession along with the nobles of Niphon, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; errand-bearers,
<BR>Bringing up the rear, hovering above, around, or in the ranks
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; marching,
<BR>But I will sing you a song of what I behold Libertad.
<BR>When million-footed Manhattan unpent descends to her
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pavements,
<BR>When the thunder-cracking guns arouse me with the proud
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; roar I love,
<BR>When the round-mouth'd guns out of the smoke and smell I
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; love spit their salutes,
<BR>When the fire-flashing guns have fully alerted me, and heaven
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clouds canopy my city with a delicate thin
haze,
<BR>When gorgeous the countless straight stems, the forests at
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the wharves, thicken with colors,
<BR>When every ship richly drest carries her flag at the peak,
<BR>When pennants trail and street-festoons hang from the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; windows,
<BR>When Broadway is entirely given up to foot-passengers and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; foot-standers, when the mass is densest,
<BR>When the facades of the houses are alive with people, when
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eyes gaze riveted tens of thousands at a time,
<BR>When the guests from the islands advance, when the pageant
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; moves forward visible,
<BR>When the summons is made, when the answer that waited
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thousands of years answers,
<BR>I too arising, answering, descend to the pavements, merge
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the crowd, and gaze with them.

Superb-faced Manhattan!
<BR>Comrade Americanos! to us, then at last the Orient comes.
<BR>To us, my city,
<BR>Where our tall-topt marble and iron beauties range on
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; opposite sides, to walk in the space between,
<BR>To-day our Antipodes comes.
<BR>The Originatress comes,
<BR>The nest of languages, the bequeather of poems, the race of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eld,
<BR>Florid with blood, pensive, rapt with musings, hot with
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; passion,
<BR>Sultry with perfume, with ample and flowing garments,
<BR>With sunburnt visage, with intense soul and glittering eyes,
<BR>The race of Brahma comes.
<BR>See my cantabile! these and more are flashing to us from the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; procession,
<BR>As it moves changing, a kaleidoscope divine it moves changing
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; before us.
<BR>For not the envoys nor the tann'd Japanee from his island
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only,
<BR>Lithe and silent the Hindoo appears, the Asiatic continent
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; itself appears, the past, the dead,
<BR>The murky night-morning of wonder and fable inscrutable,
<BR>The envelop'd mysteries, the old and unknown hive-bees,
<BR>The north, the sweltering south, eastern Assyria, the Hebrews,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the ancient of ancients,
<BR>Vast desolated cities, the gliding present, all of these and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more are in the pageant-procession.
<BR>Geography, the world, is in it,
<BR>The Great Sea, the brood of islands, Polynesia, the coast
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beyond,
<BR>The coast you henceforth are facing &amp;emdash; you, Libertad! from
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your Western golden shores,
<BR>The countries there with their populations, the millions enmasse
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are curiously here,
<BR>The swarming market-places, the temples with idols ranged
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; along the sides or at the end, bonze, brahmin,
and llama,
<BR>Mandarin, farmer, merchant, mechanic, and fisherman,
<BR>The singing-girl and the dancing-girl, the ecstatic persons,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the secluded emperors,
<BR>Confucius himself, the great poets and heroes, the warriors,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the castes, all,
<BR>Trooping up, crowding from all directions, from the Altay
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mountains,
<BR>From Thibet, from the four winding and far-flowing rivers of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; China,
<BR>From the southern peninsulas and the demi-continental
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; islands, from Malaysia,
<BR>These and whatever belongs to them palpable show forth to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me, and are seiz'd by me,
<BR>And I am seiz'd by them, and friendlily held by them,
<BR>Till as here them all I chant, Libertad! for themselves and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for you.

<P>&nbsp;

<P>For I too raising my voice join the ranks of this pageant,
<BR>I am the chanter, I chant aloud over the pageant,
<BR>I chant the world on my Western sea,
<BR>I chant copious the islands beyond, thick as stars in the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sky,
<BR>I chant the new empire grander than any before, as in a
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vision it comes to me,
<BR>I chant America the mistress, I chant a greater supremacy,
<BR>I chant projected a thousand blooming cities yet in time on
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those groups of sea-islands,
<BR>My sail-ships and steam-ships threading the archipelagoes,
<BR>My stars and stripes fluttering in the wind,
<BR>Commerce opening, the sleep of ages having done its work,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; races reborn, refresh'd,
<BR>Lives, works resumed &amp;emdash; the object I know not &amp;emdash;
but the old,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Asiatic renew'd as it must be,
<BR>Commencing from this day surrounded by the world.
<CENTER>3</CENTER>
And you Libertad of the world!
<BR>You shall sit in the middle well-pois'd thousands and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thousands of years,
<BR>As to-day from one side the nobles of Asia come to you,
<BR>As to-morrow from the other side the queen of England sends
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; her eldest son to you.
<BR>The sign is reversing, the orb is enclosed,
<BR>The ring is circled, the journey is done,
<BR>The box-lid is but perceptibly open'd, nevertheless the perfume
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pours copiously out of the whole box.
<BR>Young Libertad! with the venerable Asia, the all-mother,
<BR>Be considerate with her now and ever hot Libertad, for you
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are all,
<BR>Bend your proud neck to the long-off mother now sending
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; messages over the archipelagoes to you,
<BR>Bend your proud neck low for once, young Libertad.
<BR>Were the children straying westward so long? so wide the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tramping?
<BR>Were the precedent dim ages debouching westward from
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paradise so long?
<BR>Were the centuries steadily footing it that way, all the while
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unknown, for you, for reasons?
<BR>They are justified, they are accomplish'd, they shall now be
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turn'd the other way also, to travel toward
you thence,
<BR>They shall now also march obediently eastward for your
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sake Libertad.
