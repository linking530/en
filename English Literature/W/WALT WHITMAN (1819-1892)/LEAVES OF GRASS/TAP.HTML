F<FONT SIZE=-1>irst</FONT> O songs for a prelude,
<BR>Lightly strike on the stretch'd tympanum pride and joy in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my city,
<BR>How she led the rest to arms, how she gave the cue,
<BR>How at once with lithe limbs unwaiting a moment she sprang,
<BR>(O superb! O Manhattan, my own, my peerless!
<BR>O strongest you in the hour of danger, in crisis! O truer
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than steel!)
<BR>How you sprang&amp;emdash;how you threw off the costumes of peace
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with indifferent hand,
<BR>How your soft opera-music changed, and the drum and fife
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; were heard in their stead,
<BR>How you led to the war, (that shall serve for our prelude,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; songs of soldiers,)
<BR>How Manhattan drum-taps led.

<P>&nbsp;Forty years had I in my city seen soldiers parading,
<BR>Forty years as a pageant, till unawares the lady of this
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; teeming and turbulent city,
<BR>Sleepless amid her ships, her houses, her incalculable wealth,
<BR>With her million children around her, suddenly,
<BR>At dead of night, at news from the south,
<BR>Incens'd struck with clinch'd hand the pavement.

<P>&nbsp;A shock electric, the night sustain'd it,
<BR>Till with ominous hum our hive at daybreak pour'd out its
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; myriads.

<P>&nbsp;From the houses then and the workshops, and through all
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the doorways,
<BR>Leapt they tumultuous, and lo! Manhattan arming.

<P>&nbsp;To the drum-taps prompt,
<BR>The young men falling in and arming,
<BR>The mechanics arming, (the trowel, the jack-plane, the blacksmith's
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hammer, tost aside with precipitation,)
<BR>The lawyer leaving his office and arming, the judge leaving
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the court,
<BR>The driver deserting his wagon in the street, jumping down,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; throwing the reins abruptly down on the horses'
backs,
<BR>The salesman leaving the store, the boss, book-keeper,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; porter, all leaving;
<BR>Squads gather everywhere by common consent and arm,
<BR>The new recruits, even boys, the old men show them how to wear
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their accoutrements, they buckle the straps
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; carefully,
<BR>Outdoors, arming, indoors arming, the flash of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; musketbarrels,
<BR>The white tents cluster in camps, the arm'd sentries around,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the sunrise cannon and again at sunset,
<BR>Arm'd regiments arrive every day, pass through the city,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and embark from the wharves,
<BR>(How good they look as they tramp down to the river, sweaty,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with their guns on their shoulders!
<BR>How I love them! how I could hug them, with their brown
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; faces and their clothes and knapsacks cover'd
with
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dust!)
<BR>The blood of the city up&amp;emdash;arm'd! arm'd! the cry everywhere,
<BR>The flags flung out from the steeples of churches and from all
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the public buildings and stores,
<BR>The tearful parting, the mother kisses her son, the son kisses
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his mother,
<BR>(Loth is the mother to part, yet not a word does she speak to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; detain him,)
<BR>The tumultuous escort, the ranks of policemen preceding,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clearing the way,
<BR>The unpent enthusiasm, the wild cheers of the crowd for
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their favorites,
<BR>The artillery, the silent cannons bright as gold, drawn along,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rumble lightly over the stones,
<BR>(Silent cannons, soon to cease your silence,
<BR>Soon unlimber'd to begin the red business;)

<P>&nbsp;All the mutter of preparation, all the determin'd arming,
<BR>The hospital service, the lint, bandages and medicines,
<BR>The women volunteering for nurses, the work begun for in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; earnest, no mere parade now;
<BR>War! an arm'd race is advancing! the welcome for battle, no
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turning away;
<BR>War! be it weeks, months, or years, an arm'd race is advancing
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to welcome it.

<P>&nbsp;Mannahatta a-march&amp;emdash;and it's O to sing it well!
<BR>It's O for a manly life in the camp.

<P>&nbsp;And the sturdy artillery,
<BR>The guns bright as gold, the work for giants, to serve well the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; guns,
<BR>Unlimber them! (no more as the past forty years for salute or
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; courtesies merely,
<BR>Put in something now besides powder and wadding.)

<P>&nbsp;And you lady of ships, you Mannahatta,
<BR>Old matron of this proud, friendly, turbulent city,
<BR>Often in peace and wealth you were pensive or covertly frown'd
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; amid all your children,
<BR>But now you smile with joy exulting old Mannahatta.

<BR>With well-gristled body and sunburnt face and hands, with
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a knife in the belt at your side,
<BR>As I heard you shouting loud, your sonorous voice ringing
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; across the continent,
<BR>Your masculine voice O year, as rising amid the great cities,

<P>&nbsp;Amid the men of Manhattan I saw you as one of the workmen,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the dwellers in Manhattan,
<BR>Or with large steps crossing the prairies out of Illinois and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indiana,
<BR>Rapidly crossing the West with springy gait and descending
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Alleghanies,
<BR>Or down from the great lakes or in Pennsylvania, or on deck
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; along the Ohio river,
<BR>Or southward along the Tennessee or Cumberland rivers, or
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at Chattanooga on the mountain top,
<BR>Saw I your gait and saw I your sinewy limbs clothed in blue,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bearing weapons, robust year,
<BR>Heard your determin'd voice launch'd forth again and again,
<BR>Year that suddenly sang by the mouths of the round-lipp'd

<CENTER>SONG OF THE BANNER AT DAYBREAK</CENTER>

O A new song, a free song,
<BR>Flapping, flapping, flapping, flapping, by sounds, by voices
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clearer,
<BR>By the wind's voice and that of the drum,
<BR>By the banner's voice and child's voice and sea's voice and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; father's voice,
<BR>Low on the ground and high in the air,
<BR>On the ground where father and child stand,
<BR>In the upward air where their eyes turn,
<BR>Where the banner at daybreak is flapping.

<P>&nbsp;Words! book-words! what are you?
<BR>Words no more, for hearken and see,
<BR>My song is there in the open air, and I must sing,
<BR>With the banner and pennant a-flapping.

<P>&nbsp;I'll weave the chord and twine in,
<BR>Man's desire and babe's desire, I'll twine them in, I'll put in
<BR>life,
<BR>I'll put the bayonet's flashing point, I'll let bullets and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; slugs whizz,
<BR>(As one carrying a symbol and menace far into the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; future,
<BR>Crying with trumpet voice, <I>Arouse and beware! Beware and</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arouse</I>!)
<BR>I'll pour the verse with streams of blood, full of volition, full
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of joy,
<BR>Then loosen, launch forth, to go and compete,
<BR>With the banner and pennant a-flapping.

Fresh and rosy red the sun is mounting high,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; channels,
<BR>On floats the wind over the breast of the sea setting in toward
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; land,
<BR>The great steady wind from west or west-by-south,
<BR>Floating so buoyant with milk-white foam on the waters.

<P>&nbsp;But I am not the sea nor the red sun,
<BR>I am not the wind with girlish laughter,
<BR>Not the immense wind which strengthens, not the wind
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which lashes,
<BR>Not the spirit that ever lashes its own body to terror and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; death,
<BR>But I am that which unseen comes and sings, sings, sings,
<BR>Which babbles in brooks and scoots in showers on the land,
<BR>Which the birds know in the woods mornings and evenings,
<BR>And the shore-sands know and the hissing wave, and that
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; banner and pennant,

When I clutch'd your hand it was not with terror,
<BR>But suddenly pouring about me here on every side,
<BR>And below there where the boys were drilling, and up the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; slopes they ran,
<BR>And where tents are pitch'd, and wherever you see south and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; south-east and south-west,
<BR>Over hills, across lowlands and in the skirts of woods,
<BR>And along the shores in mire (now fill'd over) came again
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and suddenly raged,

<P>&nbsp;As eighty-five years a-gone no mere parade receiv'd with
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; applause of friends,
<BR>But a battle which I took part in myself&amp;emdash;aye, long ago as
it is,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I took part in it,
<BR>Walking then this hilltop, this same ground.

<P>&nbsp;Aye, this is the ground,
<BR>My blind eyes even as I speak behold it re-peopled from
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; graves,
<BR>The years recede, pavements and stately houses disappear,
<BR>Rude forts appear again, the old hoop'd guns are mounted,
<BR>I see the lines of rais'd earth stretching from river to bay,
<BR>I mark the vista of waters, I mark the uplands and slopes;
<BR>Here we lay encamp'd, it was this time in summer also.

<P>&nbsp;As I talk I remember all, I remember the Declaration,
<BR>It was read here, the whole army paraded, it was read to us
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; here,
<BR>By his staff surrounded the General stood in the middle,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he held up his unsheath'd sword,
<BR>It glitter'd in the sun in full sight of the army.

<P>&nbsp;'Twas a bold act then&amp;emdash;the English war-ships had just
arrived,
<BR>We could watch down the lower bay where they lay at
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; anchor,
<BR>And the transports swarming with soldiers.

<P>&nbsp;A few days more and they landed and then the battle.

<P>&nbsp;Twenty thousand were brought against us,
<BR>A veteran force furnish'd with good artillery.

<P>&nbsp;I tell not now the whole of the battle,
<BR>But one brigade early in the forenoon order'd forward to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; engage the red-coats,
<BR>Of that brigade I tell, and how steadily it march'd,
<BR>And how long and well it stood confronting death.

<P>&nbsp;Who do you think that was marching steadily sternly
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; confronting death?
<BR>It was the brigade of the youngest men, two thousand strong,
<BR>Rais'd in Virginia and Maryland, and most of them known
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; personally to the General.

<P>&nbsp;Jauntily forward they went with quick step toward Gowanus'
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; waters,
<BR>Till of a sudden unlook'd for by defiles through the woods,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gain'd at night,
<BR>The British advancing, rounding in from the east, fiercely
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; playing their guns,
<BR>That brigade of the youngest was cut off and at the enemy's
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mercy.

<P>&nbsp;The General watch'd them from this hill,
<BR>They made repeated desperate attempts to burst their
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; environment,
<BR>Then drew close together, very compact, their flag flying in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the middle,
<BR>But O from the hills how the cannon were thinning and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thinning them!

<P>&nbsp;It sickens me yet, that slaughter!
<BR>I saw the moisture gather in drops on the face of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; General.
<BR>I saw how he wrung his hands in anguish.

<P>&nbsp;Meanwhile the British manoeuvr'd to draw us out for a
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pitch'd battle,
<BR>But we dared not trust the chances of a pitch'd battle.

<P>&nbsp;We fought the fight in detachments,
<BR>Sallying forth we fought at several points, but in each the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; luck was against us,
<BR>Our foe advancing, steadily getting the best of it, push'd us
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; back to the works on this hill,
<BR>Till we turn'd menacing here, and then he left us.

<P>&nbsp;That was the going out of the brigade of the youngest men,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; two thousand strong,
<BR>Few return'd, nearly all remain in Brooklyn.

<P>&nbsp;That and here my General's first battle,
<BR>No women looking on nor sunshine to bask in, it did not
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conclude with applause,
<BR>Nobody clapp'd hands here then.

<P>&nbsp;But in darkness in mist on the ground under a chill rain,
<BR>Wearied that night we lay foil'd and sullen,
<BR>While scornfully laugh'd many an arrogant lord off against
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; us encamp'd,
<BR>Quite within hearing, feasting, clinking wineglasses together
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; over their victory.

<P>&nbsp;So dull and damp and another day,
<BR>But the night of that, mist lifting, rain ceasing,
<BR>Silent as a ghost while they thought they were sure of him,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my General retreated.

<P>&nbsp;I saw him at the river-side,
<BR>Down by the ferry lit by torches, hastening the embarcation;
<BR>My General waited till the soldiers and wounded were all
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pass'd over,
<BR>And then, (it was just ere sunrise,) these eyes rested on him
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the last time.

<P>&nbsp;Every one else seem'd fill'd with gloom,
<BR>Many no doubt thought of capitulation.

<P>&nbsp;But when my General pass'd me,
<BR>As he stood in his boat and look'd toward the coming sun,
<BR>I saw something different from capitulation.

<BR>Be not dishearten'd, affection shall solve the problems of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; freedom yet,
<BR>Those who love each other shall become invincible,

<P>&nbsp;Sons of the Mother of All, you shall yet be victorious,
<BR>You shall yet laugh to scorn the attacks of all the remainder
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the earth.
<BR>No danger shall balk Columbia's lovers,
<BR>If need be a thousand shall sternly immolate themselves for
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one.

<P>&nbsp;One from Massachusetts shall be a Missourian's comrade,
<BR>From Maine and from hot Carolina, and another an Oregonese,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall be friends triune,
<BR>More precious to each other than all the riches of the earth.

<P>&nbsp;To Michigan, Florida perfumes shall tenderly come,
<BR>Not the perfumes of flowers, but sweeter, and wafted beyond
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; death.

<P>&nbsp;It shall be customary in the houses and streets to see manly
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; affection,
<BR>The most dauntless and rude shall touch face to face lightly,
<BR>The dependence of Liberty shall be lovers,
<BR>The continuance of Equality shall be comrades.

<P>&nbsp;These shall tie you and band you stronger than hoops of iron,
<BR>I, ecstatic, O partners! O lands, with the love of lovers tie
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you.

W<FONT SIZE=-1>hile</FONT> my wife at my side lies slumbering, and the
wars are
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; over long,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; midnight passes,
<BR>And through the stillness, through the dark, I hear, just hear,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the breath of my infant,
<BR>There in the room as I wake from sleep this vision presses
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; upon me;
<BR>The engagement opens there and then in fantasy unreal,
<BR>The skirmishers begin, they crawl cautiously ahead, I hear
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the irregular snap! snap!
<BR>I hear the sounds of the different missiles, the short <I>t-h-t!</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; t-h-t!</I> of the rifle-balls,
<BR>I see the shells exploding leaving small white clouds, I hear
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the great shells shrieking as they pass,
<BR>The grape like the hum and whirr of wind through the trees,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (tumultuous now the contest rages,)
<BR>All the scenes at the batteries rise in detail before me
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; again,
<BR>The crashing and smoking, the pride of the men in their
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pieces,
<BR>The chief-gunner ranges and sights his piece and selects a fuse
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the right time,
<BR>After firing I see him lean aside and look eagerly off to note
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the effect;
<BR>Elsewhere I hear the cry of a regiment charging, (the young
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; colonel leads himself this time with brandish'd
sword,)
<BR>I see the gaps cut by the enemy's volleys, (quickly fill'd up, no
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; delay,)
<BR>I breathe the suffocating smoke, then the flat clouds hover
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; low concealing all;
<BR>Now a strange lull for a few seconds, not a shot fired on
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; either side,
<BR>Then resumed the chaos louder than ever, with eager calls
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and orders of officers,
<BR>While from some distant part of the field the wind wafts
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to my ears a shout of applause, (some special
success,)
<BR>And ever the sound of the cannon far or near, (rousing even
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in dreams a devilish exultation and all the
old mad joy in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the depths of my soul,)
<BR>And ever the hastening of infantry shifting positions,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; batteries, cavalry, moving hither and thither,
<BR>(The falling, dying, I heed not, the wounded dripping and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; red I heed not, some to the rear are hobbling,)
<BR>Grime, heat, rush, aides-de-camp galloping by or on a full
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; run,
<BR>With the patter of small arms, the warning <I>s-s-t</I> of the rifles,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (these in my vision I hear or see,)
<BR>And bombs bursting in air, and at night the vari-color'd
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rockets.
