AMBITION</H2></CENTER>
O<FONT SIZE=-1>ne</FONT> day an obscure youth, a wanderer,
<BR>Known but to few, lay musing with himself
<BR>About the chances of his future life.
<BR>In that youth's heart, there dwelt the coal Ambition,
<BR>Burning and glowing; and he asked himself,
<BR>"Shall I, in time to come, be great and famed?"
<BR>Now soon an answer wild and mystical
<BR>Seemed to sound forth from out the depths of air;
<BR>And to the gazer's eye appeared a shape
<BR>Like one as of a cloud &amp;emdash; and thus it spoke:

<P>&nbsp;"O, many a panting, noble heart
<BR>Cherishes in its deep recess
<BR>The hope to win renown o'er earth
<BR>From Glory's prized caress.

<P>&nbsp;"And some will win that envied goal,
<BR>And have their deeds known far and wide;
<BR>And some &amp;emdash; by far the most &amp;emdash; will sink
<BR>Down in oblivion's tide.

<P>&nbsp;"But <I>thou</I>, who visions bright dost cull
<BR>From the imagination's store,
<BR>With dreams, such as the youthful dream
<BR>Of grandeur, love, and power,

<P>&nbsp;"Fanciest that thou shalt build a name
<BR>And come to have the nations know
<BR>What conscious might dwells in the brain
<BR>That throbs beneath that brow?

<P>&nbsp;"And see thick countless ranks of men
<BR>Fix upon <I>thee</I> their reverent gaze &amp;emdash;
<BR>And listen to the plaudits loud
<BR>To <I>thee</I> that thousands raise?

<P>&nbsp;"Weak, childish soul! the very place
<BR>That pride has made for folly's rest;
<BR>What thoughts, with vanity all rife,
<BR>Fill up thy heaving breast!

<P>&nbsp;"At night, go view the solemn stars
<BR>Those wheeling worlds through time the same &amp;emdash;
<BR>How puny seem the widest power,
<BR>The proudest mortal name!

<P>&nbsp;"Think too, that all, lowly and rich,
<BR>Dull idiot mind and teeming sense,
<BR>Alike must sleep the endless sleep,
<BR>A hundred seasons hence.

<P>&nbsp;"So, frail one, never more repine,
<BR>Though thou livest on obscure, unknown;
<BR>Though after death unsought may be
<BR>Thy markless resting stone."

<P>&nbsp;And as these accents dropped in the youth's ears,
<BR>He felt him sick at heart; for many a month
<BR>His fancy had amused and charmed itself
<BR>With lofty aspirations, visions fair
<BR>Of what he <I>might be</I>. And it pierced him sore
<BR>To have his airy castles thus dashed down.

<P>O<FONT SIZE=-1>f</FONT> olden time, when it came to pass
<BR>That the beautiful god, Jesus, should finish his work on earth
<BR>Then went Judas, and sold the divine youth,
<BR>And took pay for his body.

<P>&nbsp;Curs'd was the deed, even before the sweat of the clutching
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hand grew dry;
<BR>And darkness frown'd upon the seller of the like of God,
<BR>Where, as though earth lifted her breast to throw him from
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; her, and heaven refused him,
<BR>He hung in the air, self-slaughter'd.

<P>&nbsp;The cycles, with their long shadows, have stalk'd silently
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; forward,
<BR>Since those ancient days &amp;emdash; many a pouch enwrapping mean
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while
<BR>Its fee, like that paid for the son of Mary.

<P>&nbsp;And still goes one, saying,
<BR>"What will ye give me, and I will deliver this man unto
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you?"
<BR>And they make the covenant, and pay the pieces of silver.

<P>&nbsp;

<P>Look forth, deliverer,
<BR>Look forth, first-born of the dead,
<BR>Over the tree-tops of Paradise;
<BR>See thyself in yet continued bonds,
<BR>Toilsome and poor, thou bear'st man's form again,
<BR>Thou art reviled, scourged, put into prison,
<BR>Hunted from the arrogant equality of the rest;
<BR>With staves and swords throng the willing servants of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; authority,
<BR>Again they surround thee, mad with devilish spite;
<BR>Toward thee stretch the hands of a multitude, like vultures'
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; talons,
<BR>The meanest spit in thy face, they smite thee with their
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; palms;
<BR>Bruised, bloody, and pinion'd is thy body,
<BR>More sorrowful than death is thy soul.

<P>&nbsp;Witness of anguish, brother of slaves,
<BR>Not with thy price closed the price of thine image:
<BR>And still Iscariot plies his trade.

S<FONT SIZE=-1>uddenly</FONT>, out of its stale and drowsy air, the air
of slaves,
<BR>Like lightning Europe le'pt forth,
<BR>Sombre, superb and terrible,
<BR>As Ahimoth, brother of Death.
<BR>God, 'twas delicious!
<BR>That brief, tight, glorious grip
<BR>Upon the throats of kings.
<BR>You liars paid to defile the People,

<P>&nbsp;Mark you now:
<BR>Not for numberless agonies, murders, lusts,
<BR>For court thieving in its manifold mean forms,
<BR>Worming from his simplicity the poor man's wages;
<BR>For many a promise sworn by royal lips
<BR>And broken, and laughed at in the breaking;
<BR>Then, in their power, not for all these,
<BR>Did a blow fall in personal revenge,
<BR>Or a hair draggle in blood:
<BR>The People scorned the ferocity of kings.

<P>&nbsp;But the sweetness of mercy brewed bitter destruction,
<BR>And frightened rulers come back:
<BR>Each comes in state, with his train,
<BR>Hangman, priest, and tax-gatherer,
<BR>Soldier, lawyer, and sycophant;
<BR>As appalling procession of locusts,
<BR>And the king struts grandly again.

<P>&nbsp;Yet behind all, lo, a Shape
<BR>Vague as the night, draped interminably,
<BR>Head, front and form, in scarlet folds,
<BR>Whose face and eyes none may see,
<BR>Out of its robes only this,
<BR>The red robes, lifted by the arm,
<BR>One finger pointed high over the top,
<BR>Like the head of a snake appears.

<P>&nbsp;Meanwhile, corpses lie in new-made graves,
<BR>Bloody corpses of young men;
<BR>The rope of the gibbet hangs heavily,
<BR>The bullets of tyrants are flying,
<BR>The creatures of power laugh aloud:
<BR>And all these things bear fruits, and they are good.

<P>&nbsp;Those corpses of young men,
<BR>Those martyrs that hang from the gibbets,
<BR>Those hearts pierced by the grey lead,
<BR>Cold and motionless as they seem,
<BR>Live elsewhere with undying vitality;
<BR>They live in other young men, O, kings,
<BR>They live in brothers, again ready to defy you;
<BR>They were purified by death,
<BR>They were taught and exalted.
<BR>Not a grave of those slaughtered ones,
<BR>But is growing its seed of freedom,
<BR>In its turn to bear seed,
<BR>Which the winds shall carry afar and resow,
<BR>And the rain nourish.
<BR>Not a disembodied spirit
<BR>Can the weapon of tyrants let loose,
<BR>But it shall stalk invisibly over the earth,
<BR>Whispering, counselling, cautioning.

<P>&nbsp;Liberty, let others despair of thee,
<BR>But I will never despair of thee:
<BR>Is the house shut? Is the master away?
<BR>Nevertheless, be ready, be not weary of watching,
<BR>He will surely return; his messengers come anon.

<P>G<FONT SIZE=-1>reat</FONT> are the myths &amp;emdash; I too delight
in them;
<BR>Great are Adam and Eve &amp;emdash; I too look back and accept them;
<BR>Great the risen and fallen nations, and their poets, women,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sages, inventors, rulers, warriors, and priests.

<P>&nbsp;Great is Liberty! great is Equality! I am their follower;
<BR>Helmsmen of nations, choose your craft! where you sail, I sail,
<BR>I weather it out with you, or sink with you.

<P>&nbsp;Great is Youth &amp;emdash; equally great is Old Age &amp;emdash;
great are the Day
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and Night;
<BR>Great is Wealth &amp;emdash; great is Poverty &amp;emdash; great is
Expression &amp;emdash;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; great is Silence.

<P>&nbsp;Youth, large, lusty, loving &amp;emdash; Youth, full of grace,
force,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fascination!
<BR>Do you know that Old Age may come after you, with equal
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grace, force, fascination?

<P>&nbsp;Day, full-blown and splendid &amp;emdash; Day of the immense sun,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; action, ambition, laughter,
<BR>The Night follows close, with millions of suns, and sleep, and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; restoring darkness.

<P>&nbsp;Wealth, with the flush hand, fine clothes, hospitality;
<BR>But then the Soul's wealth, which is candor, knowledge,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pride, enfolding love;
<BR>(Who goes for men and women showing Poverty richer than
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wealth?)

<P>&nbsp;Expression of speech! in what is written or said, forget not
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that Silence is also expressive,
<BR>That anguish as hot as the hottest, and contempt as cold as
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the coldest, may be without words.

<P>Great is the Earth, and the way it became what it is;
<BR>Do you imagine it has stopt at this? the increase aban

<BR>Understand then that it goes as far onward from this, as this
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is from the times when it lay in covering waters
and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gases, before man had appear'd.

<P>&nbsp;Great is the quality of Truth in man;
<BR>The quality of truth in man supports itself through all
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; changes,
<BR>It is inevitably in the man &amp;emdash; he and it are in love, and
never
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; leave each other.

<P>&nbsp;The truth in man is no dictum, it is vital as eyesight;
<BR>If there be any Soul, there is truth &amp;emdash; if there be man or
woman
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there is truth &amp;emdash; if there be physical
or moral, there is
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; truth;
<BR>If there be equilibrium or volition, there is truth &amp;emdash; if
there be
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; things at all upon the earth, there is truth.

<P>&nbsp;O truth of the earth! I am determin'd to press my way
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; toward you;
<BR>Sound your voice! I scale mountains, or dive in the sea after
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you.

<BR>It is greater than wealth &amp;emdash; it is greater than buildings,
ships,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; English?
<BR>Great is the English brood &amp;emdash; what brood has so vast a
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; destiny as the English?
<BR>It is the mother of the brood that must rule the earth with the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; new rule;
<BR>The new rule shall rule as the Soul rules, and as the love,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; justice, equality in the Soul rule.

the law,

the Soul;

<BR>It is immutable &amp;emdash; it does not depend on majorities &amp;emdash;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; majorities or what not, come at last before the
same passionless
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and exact tribunal.

<P>&nbsp;For justice are the grand natural lawyers, and perfect judges
&amp;emdash;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it is in their Souls;
<BR>It is well assorted &amp;emdash; they have not studied for nothing
&amp;emdash; the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; great includes the less;
<BR>They rule on the highest grounds &amp;emdash; they oversee all eras,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; states, administrations.

<P>&nbsp;The perfect judge fears nothing &amp;emdash; he could go front
to front
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; before God;
<BR>Before the perfect judge all shall stand back &amp;emdash; life and
death

stand back.
