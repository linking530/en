I <FONT SIZE=-1>wander</FONT> all night in my vision,
<BR>Stepping with light feet, swiftly and noiselessly stepping and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stopping,

<P>&nbsp;Bending with open eyes over the shut eyes of sleepers,
<BR>Wandering and confused, lost to myself, ill-assorted,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contradictory,
<BR>Pausing, gazing, bending, and stopping.

<P>&nbsp;How solemn they look there, stretch'd and still,
<BR>How quiet they breathe, the little children in their cradles.

<P>&nbsp;The wretched features of ennuy&egrave;s, the white features of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; corpses, the livid faces of drunkards, the sick-gray
faces
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of onanists,
<BR>The gash'd bodies on battle-fields, the insane in their strong-
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; door'd rooms, the sacred idiots, the new-born emerging
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from gates, and the dying emerging from gates,
<BR>The night pervades them and infolds them.

<P>&nbsp;The married couple sleep calmly in their bed, he with his
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; palm on the hip of the wife, and she with her palm
on the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hip of the husband,
<BR>The sisters sleep lovingly side by side in their bed,
<BR>The men sleep lovingly side by side in theirs,
<BR>And the mother sleeps with her little child carefully wrapt.

<P>&nbsp;The blind sleep, and the deaf and dumb sleep,
<BR>The prisoner sleeps well in the prison, the runaway son
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sleeps,
<BR>The murderer that is to be hung next day, how does he sleep?
<BR>And the murder'd person, how does he sleep?

<P>&nbsp;The female that loves unrequited sleeps,
<BR>And the male that loves unrequited sleeps,
<BR>The head of the money-maker that plotted all day sleeps,
<BR>And the enraged and treacherous dispositions, all, all sleep.

<P>&nbsp;I stand in the dark with drooping eyes by the worst-suffering
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the most restless,
<BR>I pass my hands soothingly to and fro a few inches from
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them,
<BR>The restless sink in their beds, they fitfully sleep.

<P>&nbsp;Now I pierce the darkness, new beings appear,
<BR>The earth recedes from me into the night,

<P>&nbsp;I saw that it was beautiful, and I see that what is not the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; earth is beautiful.

<P>&nbsp;I go from bedside to bedside, I sleep close with the other
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sleepers each in turn,
<BR>I dream in my dream all the dreams of the other dreamers,
<BR>And I become the other dreamers.

<P>&nbsp;I am a dance&amp;emdash;play up there! the fit is whirling me
fast!

<P>&nbsp;I am the ever-laughing&amp;emdash;it is new moon and twilight,
<BR>I see the hiding of douceurs, I see nimble ghosts whichever
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; way I look,
<BR>Cache and cache again deep in the ground and sea, and where
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it is neither ground nor sea.

<P>&nbsp;Well do they do their jobs those journeymen divine,
<BR>Only from me can they hide nothing, and would not if they
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; could,
<BR>I reckon I am their boss and they make me a pet besides,
<BR>And surround me and lead me and run ahead when I walk,
<BR>To lift their cunning covers to signify me with stretch'd arms,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and resume the way;
<BR>Onward we move, a gay gang of blackguards! with mirth-
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shouting music and wild-flapping pennants of joy!

<P>&nbsp;I am the actor, the actress, the voter, the politician,
<BR>The emigrant and the exile, the criminal that stood in the box,
<BR>He who has been famous and he who shall be famous after
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to-day,
<BR>The stammerer, the well-formed person, the wasted or feeble
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; person.

<P>&nbsp;I am she who adorn'd herself and folded her hair expectantly,
<BR>My truant lover has come, and it is dark.

<P>&nbsp;Double yourself and receive me darkness,
<BR>Receive me and my lover too, he will not let me go without
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; him.

<P>&nbsp;I roll myself upon you as upon a bed, I resign myself to the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dusk.

<P>&nbsp;He whom I call answers me and takes the place of my lover,
<BR>He rises with me silently from the bed.

<P>&nbsp;Darkness, you are gentler than my lover, his flesh was sweaty
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and panting,
<BR>I feel the hot moisture yet that he left me.

<P>&nbsp;My hands are spread forth, I pass them in all directions,
<BR>I would sound up the shadowy shore to which you are
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; journeying.

<P>&nbsp;Be careful darkness! already what was it touch'd me?
<BR>I thought my lover had gone, else darkness and he are one,
<BR>I hear the heart-beat, I follow, I fade away.

I descend my western course, my sinews are flaccid,
<BR>Perfume and youth course through me and I am their wake.

<P>&nbsp;It is my face yellow and wrinkled instead of the old woman's,
<BR>I sit low in a straw-bottom chair and carefully darn my
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grandson's stockings.

<P>&nbsp;It is I too, the sleepless widow looking out on the winter
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; midnight,
<BR>I see the sparkles of starshine on the icy and pallid earth.

<P>&nbsp;A shroud I see and I am the shroud, I wrap a body and lie in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the coffin,
<BR>It is dark here under ground, it is not evil or pain here, it is
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blank here, for reasons.

<P>&nbsp;(It seems to me that every thing in the light and air ought to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be happy,
<BR>Whoever is not in his coffin and the dark grave let him know
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he has enough.)

I see a beautiful gigantic swimmer swimming naked through
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the eddies of the sea,

<P>&nbsp;His brown hair lies close and even to his head, he strikes out
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with courageous arms, he urges himself with his
legs,
<BR>I see his white body, I see his undaunted eyes,
<BR>I hate the swift-running eddies that would dash him head-
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; foremost on the rocks.

<P>&nbsp;What are you doing you ruffianly red-trickled waves?
<BR>Will you kill the courageous giant? will you kill him in the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prime of his middle age?

<P>&nbsp;Steady and long he struggles,
<BR>He is baffled, bang'd, bruis'd, he holds out while his strength
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; holds out,
<BR>The slapping eddies are spotted with his blood, they bear him away,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they roll him, swing him, turn him,
<BR>His beautiful body is borne in the circling eddies, it is
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; continually bruis'd on rocks,
<BR>Swiftly and out of sight is borne the brave corpse.

I turn but do not extricate myself,
<BR>Confused, a past-reading, another, but with darkness yet.

<P>&nbsp;The beach is cut by the razory ice-wind, the wreck-guns
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sound,
<BR>The tempest lulls, the moon comes floundering through the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drifts.

<P>&nbsp;I look where the ship helplessly heads end on, I hear the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; burst as she strikes, I hear the howls of dismay,
they
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grow fainter and fainter.

<P>&nbsp;I cannot aid with my wringing fingers,
<BR>I can but rush to the surf and let it drench me and freeze upon
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me.

<P>&nbsp;I search with the crowd, not one of the company is wash'd to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; us alive,
<BR>In the morning I help pick up the dead and lay them in rows
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in a barn.

Now of the older war-days, the defeat at Brooklyn,
<BR>Washington stands inside the lines, he stands on the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; intrench'd hills amid a crowd of officers,
<BR>His face is cold and damp, he cannot repress the weeping
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drops,
<BR>He lifts the glass perpetually to his eyes, the color is blanch'd
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from his cheeks,
<BR>He sees the slaughter of the southern braves confided to him
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by their parents.

<P>&nbsp;The same at last and at last when peace is declared,
<BR>He stands in the room of the old tavern, the well-belov'd
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; soldiers all pass through,
<BR>The officers speechless and slow draw near in their turns,
<BR>The chief encircles their necks with his arm and kisses them
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on the cheek,
<BR>He kisses lightly the wet cheeks one after another, he shakes
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hands and bids good-by to the army.

Now what my mother told me one day as we sat at dinner
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; together,
<BR>Of when she was a nearly grown girl living home with her
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; parents on the old homestead.

<P>&nbsp;A red squaw came one breakfast-time to the old homestead,
<BR>On her back she carried a bundle of rushes for rush-bottoming
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chairs,
<BR>Her hair, straight, shiny, coarse, black, profuse, half-envelop'd
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; her face,
<BR>Her step was free and elastic, and her voice sounded
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exquisitely as she spoke.

<P>&nbsp;My mother looked in delight and amazement at the stranger,
<BR>She look'd at the freshness of her tall-borne face and full and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pliant limbs,
<BR>The more she look'd upon her she loved her,
<BR>Never before had she seen such wonderful beauty and purity,

<P>&nbsp;She made her sit on a bench by the jamb of the fireplace, she
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cook'd food for her,
<BR>She had no work to give her, but she gave her remembrance
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and fondness.

<P>&nbsp;The red squaw staid all the forenoon, and toward the middle
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the afternoon she went away,
<BR>O my mother was loth to have her go away,
<BR>All the week she thought of her, she watch'd for her many a
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; month,
<BR>She remember'd her many a winter and many a summer,
<BR>But the red squaw never came nor was heard of there again.

A show of the summer softness&amp;emdash;a contact of something unseen
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;emdash;an amour of the light and air,
<BR>I am jealous and overwhelm'd with friendliness,
<BR>And will go gallivant with the light and air myself.

<P>&nbsp;O love and summer, you are in the dreams and in me,
<BR>Autumn and winter are in the dreams, the farmer goes with
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his thrift,
<BR>The droves and crops increase, the barns are well-fill'd.

<P>&nbsp;Elements merge in the night, ships make tacks in the dreams,
<BR>The sailor sails, the exile returns home,
<BR>The fugitive returns unharm'd, the immigrant is back beyond
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; months and years,
<BR>The poor Irishman lives in the simple house of his childhood
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the well-known neighbors and faces,
<BR>They warmly welcome him, he is barefoot again, he forgets
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he is well off,
<BR>The Dutchman voyages home, and the Scotchman and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Welshman voyage home, and the native of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mediterranean voyages home,
<BR>To every port of England, France, Spain, enter well-fill'd
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ships,
<BR>The Swiss foots it toward his hills, the Prussian goes his way,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Hungarian his way, and the Pole his way,
<BR>The Swede returns, and the Dane and Norwegian return.

<P>&nbsp;The homeward bound and the outward bound,
<BR>The beautiful lost swimmer, the ennuy&egrave;e, the onanist, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; female that loves unrequited, the money-maker,
<BR>The actor and actress, those through with their parts and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those waiting to commence,
<BR>The affectionate boy, the husband and wife, the voter, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nominee that is chosen and the nominee that has
fail'd,
<BR>The great already known and the great any time after to-day,
<BR>The stammerer, the sick, the perfect-form'd, the homely,
<BR>The criminal that stood in the box, the judge that sat and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sentenced him, the fluent lawyers, the jury, the
audience,
<BR>The laugher and weeper, the dancer, the midnight widow, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; red squaw,
<BR>The consumptive, the erysipalite, the idiot, he that is wrong'd,
<BR>The antipodes, and every one between this and them in the dark,
<BR>I swear they are averaged now&amp;emdash;one is no better than the
other,
<BR>The night and sleep have liken'd them and restored them.

<P>&nbsp;I swear they are all beautiful,
<BR>Every one that sleeps is beautiful, every thing in the dim light
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is beautiful,
<BR>The wildest and bloodiest is over, and all is peace.

<P>&nbsp;Peace is always beautiful,
<BR>The myth of heaven indicates peace and night.

<P>&nbsp;The myth of heaven indicates the soul,
<BR>The soul is always beautiful, it appears more or it appears less,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it comes or it lags behind,
<BR>It comes from its embower'd garden and looks pleasantly on
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; itself and encloses the world,
<BR>Perfect and clean the genitals previously jetting, and perfect
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and clean the womb cohering,
<BR>The head well-grown proportion'd and plumb, and the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bowels and joints proportion'd and plumb.

<P>&nbsp;The soul is always beautiful,
<BR>The universe is duly in order, every thing is in its place,
<BR>What has arrived is in its place and what waits shall be in its
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; place,

<P>&nbsp;The twisted skull waits, the watery or rotten blood waits,
<BR>The child of the glutton or venerealee waits long, and the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; child of the drunkard waits long, and the drunkard
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; himself waits long,
<BR>The sleepers that lived and died wait, the far advanced are to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go on in their turns, and the far behind are to
come on in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their turns,
<BR>The diverse shall be no less diverse, but they shall flow and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unite&amp;emdash;they unite now.

The sleepers are very beautiful as they lie unclothed,
<BR>They flow hand in hand over the whole earth from east to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; west as they lie unclothed,
<BR>The Asiatic and African are hand in hand, the European and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; American are hand in hand,
<BR>Learn'd and unlearn'd are hand in hand, and male and female
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are hand in hand,
<BR>The bare arm of the girl crosses the bare breast of her lover,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they press close without lust, his lips press her
neck,
<BR>The father holds his grown or ungrown son in his arms
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with measureless love, and the son holds the father
in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his arms with measureless love,
<BR>The white hair of the mother shines on the white wrist of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; daughter,
<BR>The breath of the boy goes with the breath of the man, friend is
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inarm'd by friend,
<BR>The scholar kisses the teacher and the teacher kisses the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scholar, the wrong'd is made right,
<BR>The call of the slave is one with the master's call, and the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; master salutes the slave,
<BR>The felon steps forth from the prison, the insane becomes sane,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the suffering of sick persons is reliev'd,
<BR>The sweatings and fevers stop, the throat that was unsound is
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sound, the lungs of the consumptive are resumed,
the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; poor distress'd head is free,
<BR>The joints of the rheumatic move as smoothly as ever, and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; smoother than ever,
<BR>Stiflings and passages open, the paralyzed become supple,

<P>&nbsp;They swell'd and convuls'd and congested awake to themselves
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in condition,
<BR>They pass the invigoration of the night and the chemistry of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the night, and awake.

<P>&nbsp;I too pass from the night,
<BR>I stay a while away O night, but I return to you again and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; love you.

<P>&nbsp;Why should I be afraid to trust myself to you?
<BR>I am not afraid, I have been well brought forward by you,
<BR>I love the rich running day, but I do not desert her in whom I
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lay so long,
<BR>I know not how I came of you and I know not where I go
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with you, but I know I came well and shall go well.

<P>&nbsp;I will stop only a time with the night, and rise betimes,
<BR>I will duly pass the day O my mother, and duly return to you.
