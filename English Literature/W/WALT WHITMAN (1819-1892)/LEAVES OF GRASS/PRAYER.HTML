<I>Prayer of Columbus</I></H1></CENTER>
A <FONT SIZE=-1>batter'd</FONT>, wreck'd old man,
<BR>Thrown on this savage shore, far, far from home,
<BR>Pent by the sea and dark rebellious brows, twelve dreary
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; months,
<BR>Sore, stiff with many toils, sicken'd and nigh to death,
<BR>I take my way along the island's edge,
<BR>Venting a heavy heart.

<P>&nbsp;I am too full of woe!
<BR>Haply I may not live another day;
<BR>I cannot rest O God, I cannot eat or drink or sleep,
<BR>Till I put forth myself, my prayer, once more to Thee,
<BR>Breathe, bathe myself once more in Thee, commune with
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thee,
<BR>Report myself once more to Thee.

<P>&nbsp;Thou knowest my years entire, my life,
<BR>My long and crowded life of active work, not adoration
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; merely;
<BR>Thou knowest the prayers and vigils of my youth,

<P>&nbsp;Thou knowest my manhood's solemn and visionary
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; meditations,
<BR>Thou knowest how before I commenced I devoted all to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; come to Thee,
<BR>Thou knowest I have in age ratified all those vows and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strictly kept them,
<BR>Thou knowest I have not once lost nor faith nor ecstasy in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thee,
<BR>In shackles, prison'd, in disgrace, repining not,
<BR>Accepting all from Thee, as duly come from Thee.

<P>&nbsp;All my emprises have been fill'd with Thee,
<BR>My speculations, plans, begun and carried on in thought of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thee,
<BR>Sailing the deep or journeying the land for Thee;
<BR>Intentions, purports, aspirations mine, leaving results to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thee.

<P>&nbsp;O I am sure they really came from Thee,
<BR>The urge, the ardor, the unconquerable will,
<BR>The potent, felt, interior command, stronger than words,
<BR>A message from the Heavens whispering to me even in sleep,
<BR>These sped me on.

<P>&nbsp;By me and these the work so far accomplish'd,
<BR>By me earth's elder cloy'd and stifled lands uncloy'd,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unloos'd,
<BR>By me the hemispheres rounded and tied, the unknown to the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; known.

<P>&nbsp;The end I know not, it is all in Thee,
<BR>Or small or great I know not&amp;emdash;haply what broad fields, what
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lands,
<BR>Haply the brutish measureless human undergrowth I know,
<BR>Transplanted there may rise to stature, knowledge worthy
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thee,
<BR>Haply the swords I know may there indeed be turn'd to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reaping-tools,
<BR>Haply the lifeless cross I know, Europe's dead cross, may
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bud and blossom there.

<P>&nbsp;One effort more, my altar this bleak sand;
<BR>That Thou O God my life hast lighted,
<BR>With ray of light, steady, ineffable, vouchsafed of Thee,
<BR>Light rare untellable, lighting the very light,
<BR>Beyond all signs, descriptions, languages;
<BR>For that O God, be it my latest word, here on my knees,
<BR>Old, poor, and paralyzed, I thank Thee.

<P>&nbsp;My terminus near,
<BR>The clouds already closing in upon me,
<BR>The voyage balk'd, the course disputed, lost,
<BR>I yield my ships to Thee.

<P>&nbsp;My hands, my limbs grow nerveless,
<BR>My brain feels rack'd, bewilder'd,
<BR>Let the old timbers part, I will not part,
<BR>I will cling fast to Thee, O God, though the waves buffet me,
<BR>Thee, Thee at least I know.

<P>&nbsp;Is it the prophet's thought I speak, or am I raving?
<BR>What do I know of life? what of myself?
<BR>I know not even my own work past or present,
<BR>Dim ever-shifting guesses of it spread before me,
<BR>Of newer better worlds, their mighty parturition,
<BR>Mocking, perplexing me.

<P>&nbsp;And these things I see suddenly, what mean they?
<BR>As if some miracle, some hand divine unseal'd my eyes,
<BR>Shadowy vast shapes smile through the air and sky,
<BR>And on the distant waves sail countless ships,
<BR>And anthems in new tongues I hear saluting me.
