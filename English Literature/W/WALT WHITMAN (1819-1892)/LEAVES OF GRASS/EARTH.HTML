<P>A <FONT SIZE=-1>SONG</FONT> of the rolling earth, and of words according,
<BR>Were you thinking that those were the words, those upright lines?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those curves, angles, dots?
<BR>No, those are not the words, the substantial words are in the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ground and sea,
<BR>They are in the air, they are in you.

<P>&nbsp;Were you thinking that those were the words, those delicious
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sounds out of your friends' mouths?
<BR>No, the real words are more delicious than they.

<P>&nbsp;Human bodies are words, myriads of words,
<BR>(In the best poems re-appears the body, man's or woman's,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well-shaped, natural, gay,
<BR>Every part able, active, receptive, without shame or the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; need of shame.)

<P>&nbsp;Air, soil, water, fire&amp;emdash;those are words,
<BR>I myself am a word with them&amp;emdash;my qualities interpenetrate
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with theirs&amp;emdash;my name is nothing
to them,
<BR>Though it were told in the three thousand languages, what would
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; air, soil, water, fire, know of my name?

<P>&nbsp;A healthy presence, a friendly or commanding gesture, are
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; words, sayings, meanings,
<BR>The charms that go with the mere looks of some men and women,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are sayings and meanings also.

<P>&nbsp;The workmanship of souls is by those inaudible words of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; earth,
<BR>The masters know the earth's words and use them more than
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; audible words.

<P>&nbsp;Amelioration is one of the earth's words,
<BR>The earth neither lags nor hastens,

<P>&nbsp;It has all attributes, growths, effects, latent in itself from
the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; jump,
<BR>It is not half beautiful only, defects and excrescences show
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just as much as perfections show.

<P>&nbsp;The earth does not withhold, it is generous enough,
<BR>The truths of the earth continually wait, they are not so
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conceal'd either,
<BR>They are calm, subtle, untransmissible by print,
<BR>They are imbued through all things conveying themselves
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; willingly,
<BR>Conveying a sentiment and invitation, I utter and utter,
<BR>I speak not, yet if you hear me not of what avail am I
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to you?
<BR>To bear, to better, lacking these of what avail am I?

<P>&nbsp;(Accouche! accouchez!
<BR>Will you rot your own fruit in yourself there?
<BR>Will you squat and stifle there?)

<P>&nbsp;The earth does not argue,
<BR>Is not pathetic, has no arrangements,
<BR>Does not scream, haste, persuade, threaten, promise,
<BR>Makes no discriminations, has no conceivable failures,
<BR>Closes nothing, refuses nothing, shuts none out,
<BR>Of all the powers, objects, states, it notifies, shuts
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; none out.

<P>&nbsp;The earth does not exhibit itself nor refuse to exhibit
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; itself, possesses still underneath,
<BR>Underneath the ostensible sounds, the august chorus of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heroes, the wail of slaves,
<BR>Persuasions of lovers, curses, gasps of the dying, laughter
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of young people, accents of bargainers,
<BR>Underneath these possessing words that never fail.

<P>&nbsp;To her children the words of the eloquent dumb great
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mother never fail,
<BR>The true words do not fail, for motion does not fail and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reflection does not fail,
<BR>Also the day and night do not fail, and the voyage we
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pursue does not fail.

<P>&nbsp;Of the interminable sisters,
<BR>Of the ceaseless cotillions of sisters,
<BR>Of the centripetal and centrifugal sisters, the elder and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; younger sisters,
<BR>The beautiful sister we know dances on with the rest.

<P>&nbsp;With her ample back towards every beholder,
<BR>With the fascinations of youth and the equal fascinations
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of age,
<BR>Sits she whom I too love like the rest, sits undisturb'd,
<BR>Holding up in her hand what has the character of a mirror,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while her eyes glance back from it,
<BR>Glance as she sits, inviting none, denying none,
<BR>Holding a mirror day and night tirelessly before her own
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; face.

<P>&nbsp;Seen at hand or seen at a distance,
<BR>Duly the twenty-four appear in public every day,
<BR>Duly approach and pass with their companions or a
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; companion,
<BR>Looking from no countenances of their own, but from the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; countenances of those who are with them,
<BR>From the countenances of children or women or the manly
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; countenance,
<BR>From the open countenances of animals or from inanimate
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; things,
<BR>From the landscape or waters or from the exquisite apparition
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the sky,
<BR>From our countenances, mine and yours, faithfully returning
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them,
<BR>Every day in public appearing without fail, but never twice
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the same companions.

<P>&nbsp;Embracing man, embracing all, proceed the three hundred
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and sixty-five resistlessly round the sun;
<BR>Embracing all, soothing, supporting, follow close three hundred
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and sixty-five offsets of the first, sure
and necessary as they.

<P>&nbsp;Tumbling on steadily, nothing dreading,
<BR>Sunshine, storm, cold, heat, forever withstanding, passing,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; carrying,

<P>&nbsp;The soul's realization and determination still inheriting,
<BR>The fluid vacuum around and ahead still entering and dividing,
<BR>No balk retarding, no anchor anchoring, on no rock striking,
<BR>Swift, glad, content, unbereav'd, nothing losing,
<BR>Of all able and ready at any time to give strict account,
<BR>The divine ship sails the divine sea.

<P>&nbsp;
<CENTER>2</CENTER>


<P>Whoever you are! motion and reflection are especially for
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you,
<BR>The divine ship sails the divine sea for you.

<P>&nbsp;Whoever you are! you are he or she for whom the earth is
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; solid and liquid,
<BR>You are he or she for whom the sun and moon hang in the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sky,
<BR>For none more than you are the present and the past,
<BR>For none more than you is immortality.

<P>&nbsp;Each man to himself and each woman to herself, is the word
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the past and present, and the true word
of immortality;
<BR>No one can acquire for another&amp;emdash;not one,
<BR>Not one can grow for another&amp;emdash;not one.

<P>&nbsp;The song is to the singer, and comes back most to him,
<BR>The teaching is to the teacher, and comes back most to him,
<BR>The murder is to the murderer, and comes back most to him,
<BR>The theft is to the thief, and comes back most to him,
<BR>The love is to the lover, and comes back most to him,
<BR>The gift is to the giver, and comes back most to him&amp;emdash;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it cannot fail,
<BR>The oration is to the orator, the acting is to the actor and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; actress not to the audience,
<BR>And no man understands any greatness or goodness but his
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; own, or the indication of his own.

<P>&nbsp;
<CENTER>3</CENTER>


<P>I swear the earth shall surely be complete to him or her who
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall be complete,
<BR>The earth remains jagged and broken only to him or her who
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; remains jagged and broken.

<P>&nbsp;I swear there is no greatness or power that does not emulate
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those of the earth,
<BR>There can be no theory of any account unless it corroborate
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the theory of the earth,
<BR>No politics, song, religion, behavior, or what not, is of account,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unless it compare with the amplitude of the
earth,
<BR>Unless it face the exactness, vitality, impartiality, rectitude
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the earth.

<P>&nbsp;I swear I begin to see love with sweeter spasms than that
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which responds love,
<BR>It is that which contains itself, which never invites and never
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; refuses.

<P>&nbsp;I swear I begin to see little or nothing in audible words,
<BR>All merges toward the presentation of the unspoken meanings
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the earth,
<BR>Toward him who sings the songs of the body and of the truths
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the earth,
<BR>Toward him who makes the dictionaries of words that print
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cannot touch.

<P>&nbsp;I swear I see what is better than to tell the best,
<BR>It is always to leave the best untold.

<P>&nbsp;When I undertake to tell the best I find I cannot,
<BR>My tongue is ineffectual on its pivots,
<BR>My breath will not be obedient to its organs,
<BR>I become a dumb man.

<P>&nbsp;The best of the earth cannot be told anyhow, all or any is
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; best,
<BR>It is not what you anticipated, it is cheaper, easier, nearer,
<BR>Things are not dismiss'd from the places they held before,
<BR>The earth is just as positive and direct as it was before,
<BR>Facts, religions, improvements, politics, trades, are as real
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as before,
<BR>But the soul is also real, it too is positive and direct,
<BR>No reasoning, no proof has establish'd it,
<BR>Undeniable growth has establish'd it.

<P>&nbsp;

<P>These to echo the tones of souls and the phrases of souls,
<BR>(If they did not echo the phrases of souls what were they
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then?
<BR>If they had not reference to you in especial what were they
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then?)
<BR>I swear I will never henceforth have to do with the faith that
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tells the best,
<BR>I will have to do only with that faith that leaves the best
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; untold.

<P>&nbsp;Say on, sayers! sing on, singers!
<BR>Delve! mould! pile the words of the earth!
<BR>Work on, age after age, nothing is to be lost,
<BR>It may have to wait long, but it will certainly come in use,
<BR>When the materials are all prepared and ready, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; architects shall appear.

<P>&nbsp;I swear to you the architects shall appear without fail,
<BR>I swear to you they will understand you and justify you,
<BR>The greatest among them shall be he who best knows you,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and encloses all and is faithful to all,
<BR>He and the rest shall not forget you, they shall perceive that
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you are not an iota less than they,
<BR>You shall be fully glorified in them.
