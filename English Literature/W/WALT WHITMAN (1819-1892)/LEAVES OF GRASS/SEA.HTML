O<FONT SIZE=-1>ut</FONT> of the cradle endlessly rocking,
<BR>Out of the mocking-bird's throat, the musical shuttle,
<BR>Out of the Ninth-month midnight,
<BR>Over the sterile sands and the fields beyond, where the child
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; leaving his bed wander'd alone, bareheaded,
barefoot,
<BR>Down from the shower'd halo,
<BR>Up from the mystic play of shadows twining and twisting as if
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they were alive,
<BR>Out from the patches of briers and blackberries,
<BR>From the memories of the bird that chanted to me,
<BR>From your memories sad brother, from the fitful risings and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fallings I heard,
<BR>From under that yellow half-moon late-risen and swollen as
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if with tears,
<BR>From those beginning notes of yearning and love there in the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mist,
<BR>From the thousand responses of my heart never to cease,
<BR>From the myriad thence-arous'd words,
<BR>From the word stronger and more delicious than any,
<BR>From such as now they start the scene revisiting,
<BR>As a flock, twittering, rising, or overhead passing,
<BR>Borne hither, ere all eludes me, hurriedly,
<BR>A man, yet by these tears a little boy again,
<BR>Throwing myself on the sand, confronting the waves,
<BR>I, chanter of pains and joys, uniter of here and hereafter,
<BR>Taking all hints to use them, but swiftly leaping beyond them,
<BR>A reminiscence sing.

<P>&nbsp;Once Paumanok,
<BR>When the lilac-scent was in the air and Fifth-month grass
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was growing,
<BR>Up this seashore in some briers,
<BR>Two feather'd guests from Alabama, two together,
<BR>And their nest, and four light-green eggs spotted with brown,
<BR>And every day the he-bird to and fro near at hand,
<BR>And every day the she-bird crouch'd on her nest, silent, with
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bright eyes,
<BR>And every day I, a curious boy, never too close, never
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; disturbing them,
<BR>Cautiously peering, absorbing, translating.

<P>&nbsp;<I>Shine! shine! shine</I>!
<BR><I>Pour down your warmth, great sun</I>!
<BR><I>While we bask, we two together</I>.

<P>&nbsp;<I>Two together</I>!
<BR><I>Winds blow south, or winds blow north</I>,
<BR><I>Day come white, or night come black</I>,
<BR><I>Home, or rivers and mountains from home</I>,
<BR><I>Singing all time, minding no time</I>,
<BR><I>While we two keep together</I>.

<P>&nbsp;Till of a sudden,
<BR>May-be kill'd, unknown to her mate,
<BR>One forenoon the she-bird crouch'd not on the nest,
<BR>Nor return'd that afternoon, nor the next,
<BR>Nor ever appear'd again.

<P>&nbsp;And thenceforward all summer in the sound of the sea,
<BR>And at night under the full of the moon in calmer weather,
<BR>Over the hoarse surging of the sea,
<BR>Or flitting from brier by day,
<BR>I saw, I heard at intervals the remaining one, the he-bird,
<BR>The solitary guest from Alabama.

<P>&nbsp;<I>Blow! blow! blow</I>!
<BR><I>Blow up sea-winds along Paumanok's shore</I>;
<BR><I>I wait and I wait till you blow my mate to me</I>.

<P>&nbsp;Yes, when the stars glisten'd,
<BR>All night long on the prong of a moss-scallop'd stake,
<BR>Down almost amid the slapping waves,
<BR>Sat the lone singer wonderful causing tears.

<P>&nbsp;He call'd on his mate,
<BR>He pour'd forth the meanings which I of all men know.

<P>&nbsp;Yes my brother I know,
<BR>The rest might not, but I have treasur'd every note,
<BR>For more than once dimly down to the beach gliding,
<BR>Silent, avoiding the moonbeams, blending myself with the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shadows,
<BR>Recalling now the obscure shapes, the echoes, the sounds
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and sights after their sorts,
<BR>The white arms out in the breakers tirelessly tossing,
<BR>I, with bare feet, a child, the wind wafting my hair,
<BR>Listen'd long and long.

<P>&nbsp;Listen'd to keep, to sing, now translating the notes,
<BR>Following you my brother.

<P>&nbsp;<I>Soothe! soothe! soothe</I>!
<BR><I>Close on its wave soothes the wave behind</I>,
<BR><I>And again another behind embracing and lapping, every one close</I>,
<BR><I>But my love soothes not me, not me</I>.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><I>Low hangs the moon, it rose late</I>,
<BR><I>It is lagging &amp;emdash; O I think it is heavy with love, with
love</I>.

<P>&nbsp;<I>O madly the sea pushes upon the land</I>,
<BR><I>With love, with love</I>.

<P>&nbsp;<I>O night! do I not see my love fluttering out among the</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; breakers</I>?
<BR><I>What is that little black thing I see there in the white</I>?

<P>&nbsp;<I>Loud! loud! loud</I>!
<BR><I>Loud I call to you, my love</I>!
<BR><I>High and clear I shoot my voice over the waves</I>,
<BR><I>Surely you must know who is here, is here</I>,
<BR><I>You must know who I am, my love</I>.

<P>&nbsp;<I>Low-hanging moon</I>!
<BR><I>What is that dusky spot in your brown yellow</I>?
<BR><I>O it is the shape, the shape of my mate</I>!
<BR><I>O moon do not keep her from me any longer</I>.

<P>&nbsp;<I>Land! land! O land</I>!
<BR><I>Whichever way I turn, O I think you could give me my mate</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; back again if you only would</I>,
<BR><I>For I am almost sure I see her dimly whichever way I look</I>.

<P>&nbsp;<I>O rising stars</I>!
<BR><I>Perhaps the one I want so much will rise, will rise with some</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of you</I>.

<P>&nbsp;<I>O throat! O trembling throat</I>!
<BR><I>Sound clearer through the atmosphere</I>!
<BR><I>Pierce the woods, the earth</I>,
<BR><I>Somewhere listening to catch you must be the one I want</I>.

<P>&nbsp;<I>Shake out carols</I>!
<BR><I>Solitary here, the night's carols</I>!
<BR><I>Carols of lonesome love! death's carols</I>!
<BR><I>Carols under that lagging, yellow, waning moon</I>!
<BR><I>O under that moon where she droops almost down into the sea</I>!
<BR><I>O reckless despairing carols</I>.

<P>&nbsp;<I>But soft! sink low</I>!
<BR><I>Soft! let me just murmur</I>,
<BR><I>And do you wait a moment you husky-nois'd sea</I>,
<BR><I>For somewhere I believe I heard my mate responding to me</I>,
<BR><I>So faint, I must be still, be still to listen</I>,
<BR><I>But not altogether still, for then she might not come immediately</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to me</I>.

<P>&nbsp;<I>Hither my love</I>!
<BR><I>Here I am! here</I>!
<BR><I>With this just-sustain'd note I announce myself to you</I>,
<BR><I>This gentle call is for you my love, for you</I>.

<P>&nbsp;<I>Do not be decoy'd elsewhere</I>,
<BR><I>That is the whistle of the wind, it is not my voice</I>,
<BR><I>That is the fluttering, the fluttering of the spray</I>,
<BR><I>Those are the shadows of leaves</I>.

<P>&nbsp;<I>O darkness! O in vain</I>!
<BR><I>O I am very sick and sorrowful</I>.

<P>&nbsp;<I>O brown halo in the sky near the moon, drooping upon the sea</I>!
<BR><I>O troubled reflection in the sea</I>!
<BR><I>O throat! O throbbing heart</I>!
<BR><I>And I singing uselessly, uselessly all the night</I>.

<P>&nbsp;<I>O past! O happy life! O songs of joy</I>!
<BR><I>In the air, in the woods, over fields</I>,
<BR><I>Loved! loved! loved! loved! loved</I>!
<BR><I>But my mate no more, no more with me</I>!
<BR><I>We two together no more</I>.

<P>&nbsp;The aria sinking,
<BR>All else continuing, the stars shining,
<BR>The winds blowing, the notes of the bird continuous echoing,
<BR>With angry moans the fierce old mother incessantly moaning,
<BR>On the sands of Paumanok's shore gray and rustling,
<BR>The yellow half-moon enlarged, sagging down, drooping, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; face of the sea almost touching,
<BR>The boy ecstatic, with his bare feet the waves, with his hair the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; atmosphere dallying,
<BR>The love in the heart long pent, now loose, now at last
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tumultuously bursting,
<BR>The aria's meaning, the ears, the soul, swiftly depositing,
<BR>The strange tears down the cheeks coursing,
<BR>The colloquy there, the trio, each uttering,
<BR>The undertone, the savage old mother incessantly crying,
<BR>To the boy's soul's questions sullenly timing, some drown'd
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; secret hissing,
<BR>To the outsetting bard.

<P>&nbsp;Demon or bird! (said the boy's soul,)
<BR>Is it indeed toward your mate you sing? or is it really to me?
<BR>For I, that was a child, my tongue's use sleeping, now I have
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heard you,
<BR>Now in a moment I know what I am for, I awake,
<BR>And already a thousand singers, a thousand songs, clearer,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; louder and more sorrowful than yours,
<BR>A thousand warbling echoes have started to life within me,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; never to die.

<P>&nbsp;O you singer solitary, singing by yourself, projecting me,
<BR>O solitary me listening, never more shall I cease perpetuating
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you,
<BR>Never more shall I escape, never more the reverberations,
<BR>Never more the cries of unsatisfied love be absent from me,
<BR>Never again leave me to be the peaceful child I was before
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what there in the night,
<BR>By the sea under the yellow and sagging moon,
<BR>The messenger there arous'd, the fire, the sweet hell within,
<BR>The unknown want, the destiny of me.

<P>&nbsp;O give me the clew! (it lurks in the night here somewhere,)
<BR>O if I am to have so much, let me have more!

<P>&nbsp;A word then, (for I will conquer it,)
<BR>The word final, superior to all,
<BR>Subtle, sent up &amp;emdash; what is it? &amp;emdash; I listen;
<BR>Are you whispering it, and have been all the time, you sea
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; waves?
<BR>Is that it from your liquid rims and wet sands?
<BR>Whereto answering, the sea,
<BR>Delaying not, hurrying not,
<BR>Whisper'd me through the night, and very plainly before
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; daybreak,
<BR>Lisp'd to me the low and delicious word death,
<BR>And again death, death, death, death,
<BR>Hissing melodious, neither like the bird nor like my arous'd
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; child's heart,
<BR>But edging near as privately for me rustling at my feet,
<BR>Creeping thence steadily up to my ears and laving me softly
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all over,
<BR>Death, death, death, death, death.

<P>&nbsp;Which I do not forget,
<BR>But fuse the song of my dusky demon and brother,
<BR>That he sang to me in the moonlight on Paumanok's gray
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beach,
<BR>With the thousand responsive songs at random,
<BR>My own songs awaked from that hour,
<BR>And with them the key, the word up from the waves,
<BR>The word of the sweetest song and all songs,
<BR>That strong and delicious word which, creeping to my feet,
<BR>(Or like some old crone rocking the cradle, swathed in sweet
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; garments, bending aside,)
<BR>The sea whisper'd me.

As I ebb'd with the ocean of life,
<BR>As I wended the shores I know,
<BR>As I walk'd where the ripples continually wash you Paumanok,
<BR>Where they rustle up hoarse and sibilant,
<BR>Where the fierce old mother endlessly cries for her castaways,
<BR>I musing late in the autumn day, gazing off southward,
<BR>Held by this electric self out of the pride of which I utter
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; poems,
<BR>Was seiz'd by the spirit that trails in the lines underfoot,
<BR>The rim, the sediment that stands for all the water and all the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; land of the globe.

<P>&nbsp;Fascinated, my eyes reverting from the south, dropt, to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; follow those slender windrows,
<BR>Chaff, straw, splinters of wood, weeds, and the sea-gluten,
<BR>Scum, scales from shining rocks, leaves of salt-lettuce, left by
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the tide,
<BR>Miles walking, the sound of breaking waves the other side of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me,
<BR>Paumanok there and then as I thought the old thought of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; likenesses,
<BR>These you presented to me you fish-shaped island,

As I wend to the shores I know not,

<BR>As the ocean so mysterious rolls toward me closer and closer,
<BR>I too but signify at the utmost a little wash'd-up drift,
<BR>A few sands and dead leaves to gather,
<BR>Gather, and merge myself as part of the sands and drift.

<P>&nbsp;O baffled, balk'd, bent to the very earth,
<BR>Oppress'd with myself that I have dared to open my mouth,
<BR>Aware now that amid all that blab whose echoes recoil upon
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me I have not once had the least idea who
or what I am,
<BR>But that before all my arrogant poems the real Me stands yet
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; untouch'd, untold, altogether unreach'd,
<BR>Withdrawn far, mocking me with mock-congratulatory signs
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and bows,
<BR>With peals of distant ironical laughter at every word I have
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; written,
<BR>Pointing in silence to these songs, and then to the sand
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beneath.
<BR>I perceive I have not really understood any thing, not a
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; single object, and that no man ever can,
<BR>Nature here in sight of the sea taking advantage of me to dart
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; upon me and sting me,
