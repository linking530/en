<P>S<FONT SIZE=-1>TARTING</FONT> from fish-shape Paumanok where I was born,
<BR>Well-begotten, and rais'd by a perfect mother,
<BR>After roaming many lands, lover of populous pavements,
<BR>Dweller in Mannahatta my city, or on southern savannas,
<BR>Or a soldier camp'd or carrying my knapsack and gun, or a
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; miner in California,
<BR>Or rude in my home in Dakota's woods, my diet meat, my
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drink from the spring,
<BR>Or withdrawn to muse and meditate in some deep recess,
<BR>Far from the clank of crowds intervals passing rapt and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; happy,
<BR>Aware of the fresh free giver the flowing Missouri, aware of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mighty Niagara,
<BR>Aware of the buffalo herds grazing the plains, the hirsute and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strong-breasted bull,
<BR>Of earth, rocks, Fifth-month flowers experienced, stars, rain,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; snow, my amaze,
<BR>Having studied the mocking-bird's tones and the flight of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mountain-hawk,
<BR>And heard at dawn the unrivall'd one, the hermit thrush
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from the swamp-cedars,
<BR>Solitary, singing in the West, I strike up for a New World.

<P>Victory, union, faith, identity, time,
<BR>The indissoluble compacts, riches, mystery,
<BR>Eternal progress, the kosmos, and the modern reports.

<P>&nbsp;This then is life,
<BR>Here is what has come to the surface after so many throes
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and convulsions.
<BR>How curious! how real!
<BR>Underfoot the divine soil, overhead the sun.

<P>&nbsp;See revolving the globe,
<BR>The ancestor-continents away group'd together,
<BR>The present and future continents north and south, with the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; isthmus between.

<P>&nbsp;See, vast trackless spaces,
<BR>As in a dream they change, they swiftly fill,
<BR>Countless masses debouch upon them,
<BR>They are now cover'd with the foremost people, arts,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; institutions, known.

<P>&nbsp;See, projected through time,
<BR>For me an audience interminable.

<P>&nbsp;With firm and regular step they wend, they never stop,
<BR>Successions of men, Americanos, a hundred millions,
<BR>One generation playing its part and passing on,
<BR>Another generation playing its part and passing on in its turn,
<BR>With faces turn'd sideways or backward towards me to listen,
<BR>With eyes retrospective towards me.

<P>Americanos! conquerors! marches humanitarian!
<BR>Foremost! century marches! Libertad! masses!
<BR>For you a programme of chants.

<P>&nbsp;Chants of the prairies,
<BR>Chants of the long-running Mississippi, and down to the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mexican sea,
<BR>Chants of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minnesota,
<BR>Chants going forth from the centre from Kansas, and thence
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; equidistant,
<BR>Shooting in pulses of fire ceaseless to vivify all.

<P>Take my leaves America, take them South and take them
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; North,
<BR>Make welcome for them everywhere, for they are your own
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; offspring,
<BR>Surround them East and West, for they would surround you,
<BR>And you precedents, connect lovingly with them, for they
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; connect lovingly with you.

<P>&nbsp;I conn'd old times,
<BR>I sat studying at the feet of the great masters,
<BR>Now if eligible O that the great masters might return and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; study me.

<P>&nbsp;In the name of these States shall I scorn the antique?

<P>Dead poets, philosophs, priests,
<BR>Martyrs, artists, inventors, governments long since,
<BR>Language-shapers on other shores,
<BR>Nations once powerful, now reduced, withdrawn, or desolate,
<BR>I dare not proceed till I respectfully credit what you have left
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wafted hither,
<BR>I have perused it, own it is admirable, (moving awhile among
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it,)
<BR>Think nothing can ever be greater, nothing can ever deserve
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more than it deserves,
<BR>Regarding it all intently a long while, then dismissing it,
<BR>I stand in my place with my own day here.

<P>&nbsp;Here lands female and male,
<BR>Here the heir-ship and heiress-ship of the world, here the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flame of materials,
<BR>Here spirituality the translatress, the openly-avow'd,
<BR>The ever-tending, the final&egrave; of visible forms,
<BR>The satisfier, after due long-waiting now advancing,
<BR>Yes here comes my mistress the soul.

<P>&nbsp;
<CENTER>6</CENTER>


<P>The soul,
<BR>Forever and forever&amp;emdash;longer than soil is brown and solid&amp;emdash;
<BR>longer than water ebbs and flows.
<BR>I will make the poems of materials, for I think they are to be
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the most spiritual poems,
<BR>And I will make the poems of my body and of mortality,
<BR>For I think I shall then supply myself with the poems of my
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; soul and of immortality.

<P>&nbsp;I will make a song for these States that no one State may
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under any circumstances be subjected to another
State,
<BR>And I will make a song that there shall be comity by day and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by night between all the States, and between any
two of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them,
<BR>And I will make a song for the ears of the President, full of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; weapons with menacing points,
<BR>And behind the weapons countless dissatisfied faces;
<BR>And a song make I of the One form'd out of all,
<BR>The fang'd and glittering One including and over all,
<BR>(However high the head of any else that head is over all.)

<P>&nbsp;I will acknowledge contemporary lands,
<BR>I will trail the whole geography of the globe and salute
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; courteously every city large and small,
<BR>And employments! I will put in my poems that with you is
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heroism upon land and sea,
<BR>And I will report all heroism from an American point of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; view.

<P>&nbsp;I will sing the song of companionship,
<BR>I will show what alone must finally compact these,
<BR>I believe these are to found their own ideal of manly love,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; indicating it in me,
<BR>I will therefore let flame from me the burning fires that were
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; threatening to consume me,
<BR>I will lift what has too long kept down those smouldering
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fires,
<BR>I will give them complete abandonment,
<BR>I will write the evangel-poem of comrades and of love,
<BR>For who but I should understand love with all its sorrow and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; joy?
<BR>And who but I should be the poet of comrades?

<P>I am the credulous man of qualities, ages, races,
<BR>I advance from the people in their own spirit,
<BR>Here is what sings unrestricted faith.

<P>&nbsp;Omnes! omnes! let others ignore what they may,
<BR>I make the poem of evil also, I commemorate that part also,
<BR>I am myself just as much evil as good, and my nation is&amp;emdash;and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I say there is in fact no evil,
<BR>(Or if there is I say it is just as important to you, to the land
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or to me, as any thing else.)

<P>&nbsp;I too, following many and follow'd by many, inaugurate a
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; religion, I descend into the arena,
<BR>(It may be I am destin'd to utter the loudest cries there, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; winner's pealing shouts,
<BR>Who knows? they may rise from me yet, and soar above
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; every thing.)

<P>&nbsp;Each is not for its own sake,
<BR>I say the whole earth and all the stars in the sky are for
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; religion's sake.

<P>&nbsp;I say no man has ever yet been half devout enough,
<BR>None has ever yet adored or worship'd half enough,
<BR>None has begun to think how divine he himself is, and how
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; certain the future is.

<P>&nbsp;I say that the real and permanent grandeur of these States
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; must be their religion,
<BR>Otherwise there is no real and permanent grandeur;
<BR>(Nor character nor life worthy the name without religion,
<BR>Nor land nor man or woman without religion.)

<BR>Your ambition or business whatever it may be?

<P>&nbsp;It is well&amp;emdash;against such I say not a word, I am their
poet also,
<BR>But behold! such swiftly subside, burnt up for religion's sake,
<BR>For not all matter is fuel to heat, impalpable flame, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; essential life of the earth,
<BR>Any more than such are to religion.

<P>&nbsp;Listen dear son&amp;emdash;listen America, daughter or son,
<BR>It is a painful thing to love a man or woman to excess, and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yet it satisfies, it is great,
<BR>But there is something else very great, it makes the whole
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; coincide,
<BR>It, magnificent, beyond materials, with continuous hands
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sweeps and provides for all.

<P>Know you, solely to drop in the earth the germs of a greater
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; religion,
<BR>The following chants each for its kind I sing.

<P>&nbsp;My comrade!
<BR>For you to share with me two greatnesses, and a third one
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rising inclusive and more resplendent,
<BR>The greatness of Love and Democracy, and the greatness of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Religion.

<P>&nbsp;Melange mine own, the unseen and the seen,
<BR>Mysterious ocean where the streams empty,
<BR>Prophetic spirit of material shifting and flickering around
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me,
<BR>Living beings, identities now doubtless near us in the air that
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we know not of,
<BR>Contact daily and hourly that will not release me,
<BR>These selecting, these in hints demanded of me.

<P>&nbsp;Not he with a daily kiss onward from childhood kissing
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me,
<BR>Has winded and twisted around me that which holds me to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; him,
<BR>Any more than I am held to the heavens and all the spiritual
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; world,
<BR>After what they have done to me, suggesting themes.

<P>&nbsp;O such themes&amp;emdash;equalities! O divine average!
<BR>Warblings under the sun, usher'd as now, or at noon, or
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; setting,
<BR>Strains musical flowing through ages, now reaching hither,
<BR>I take to your reckless and composite chords, add to them,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and cheerfully pass them forward.

<P>As I have walk'd in Alabama my morning walk,
<BR>I have seen where the she-bird the mocking-bird sat on her
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nest in the briers hatching her brood.

<P>&nbsp;I have seen the he-bird also,
<BR>I have paus'd to hear him near at hand inflating his throat
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and joyfully singing.

<P>&nbsp;And while I paus'd it came to me that what he really sang for
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was not there only,
<BR>Nor for his mate nor himself only, nor all sent back by the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; echoes,
<BR>But subtle, clandestine, away beyond,
<BR>A charge transmitted and gift occult for those being born.

<P>Democracy! near at hand to you a throat is now inflating
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; itself and joyfully singing.

<P>&nbsp;Ma femme! for the brood beyond us and of us,
<BR>For those who belong here and those to come,
<BR>I exultant to be ready for them will now shake out carols
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stronger and haughtier than have ever yet
been heard
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; upon earth.
<BR>I will make the songs of passion to give them their way,
<BR>And your songs outlaw'd offenders, for I scan you with
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kindred eyes, and carry you with me the same
as any.

<P>&nbsp;I will make the true poem of riches,
<BR>To earn for the body and the mind whatever adheres and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; goes forward and is not dropt by death;
<BR>I will effuse egotism and show it underlying all, and I will be
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the bard of personality,
<BR>And I will show of male and female that either is but the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; equal of the other,
<BR>And sexual organs and acts! do you concentrate in me, for I
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; am determin'd to tell you with courageous
clear voice to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prove you illustrious,
<BR>And I will show that there is no imperfection in the present,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and can be none in the future,
<BR>And I will show that whatever happens to anybody it may be
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turn'd to beautiful results,
<BR>And I will show that nothing can happen more beautiful than
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; death,
<BR>And I will thread a thread through my poems that time and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; events are compact,
<BR>And that all the things of the universe are perfect miracles,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; each as profound as any.

<P>&nbsp;I will not make poems with reference to parts,
<BR>But I will make poems, songs, thoughts, with reference to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ensemble,
<BR>And I will not sing with reference to a day, but with reference
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to all days,
<BR>And I will not make a poem nor the least part of a poem but
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has reference to the soul,
<BR>Because having look'd at the objects of the universe, I find
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there is no one nor any particle of one but
has reference
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the soul.

<P>Was somebody asking to see the soul?
<BR>See, your own shape and countenance, persons, substances,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beasts, the trees, the running rivers, the
rocks and sands.

<P>&nbsp;All hold spiritual joys and afterwards loosen them;
<BR>How can the real body ever die and be buried?

<P>&nbsp;Of your real body and any man's or woman's real body,
<BR>Item for item it will elude the hands of the corpse-cleaners
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and pass to fitting spheres,
<BR>Carrying what has accrued to it from the moment of birth to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the moment of death.

<P>&nbsp;Not the types set up by the printer return their impression,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the meaning, the main concern,
<BR>Any more than a man's substance and life or a woman's
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; substance and life return in the body and
the soul,
<BR>Indifferently before death and after death.

<P>&nbsp;Behold, the body includes and is the meaning, the main
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; concern, and includes and is the soul;
