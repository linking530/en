S<FONT SIZE=-1>inging</FONT> my days,
<BR>Singing the great achievements of the present,
<BR>Singing the strong light works of engineers,
<BR>Our modern wonders, (the antique ponderous Seven outvied,)
<BR>In the Old World the east the Suez canal,
<BR>The New by its mighty railroad spann'd,
<BR>The seas inlaid with eloquent gentle wires;
<BR>Yet first to sound, and ever sound, the cry with thee O soul,
<BR>The Past! the Past! the Past!

<P>&nbsp;The Past&amp;emdash;the dark unfathom'd retrospect!
<BR>The teeming gulf&amp;emdash;the sleepers and the shadows!
<BR>The past&amp;emdash;the infinite greatness of the past!
<BR>For what is the present after all but a growth out of the past?
<BR>(As a projectile form'd, impell'd, passing a certain line, still
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; keeps on,
<BR>So the present, utterly form'd, impell'd by the past.)

Passage O soul to India!
<BR>Eclaircise the myths Asiatic, the primitive fables.
<BR>Not you alone proud truths of the world,
<BR>Nor you alone ye facts of modern science,
<BR>But myths and fables of eld, Asia's, Africa's fables,
<BR>The far-darting beams of the spirit, the unloos'd dreams,
<BR>The deep diving bibles and legends,
<BR>The daring plots of the poets, the elder religions;
<BR>O you temples fairer than lilies pour'd over by the rising
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sun!
<BR>O you fables spurning the known, eluding the hold of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; known, mounting to heaven!
<BR>You lofty and dazzling towers, pinnacled, red as roses,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; burnish'd with gold!
<BR>Towers of fables immortal fashion'd from mortal dreams!
<BR>You too I welcome and fully the same as the rest!
<BR>You too with joy I sing.

<P>&nbsp;Passage to India!
<BR>Lo, soul, seest thou not God's purpose from the first?
<BR>The earth to be spann'd, connected by network,
<BR>The races, neighbors, to marry and be given in marriage,
<BR>The oceans to be cross'd, the distant brought near,
<BR>The lands to be welded together.

<P>&nbsp;A worship new I sing,
<BR>You captains, voyagers, explorers, yours,
<BR>You engineers, you architects, machinists, yours,
<BR>You, not for trade or transportation only,
<BR>But in God's name, and for thy sake O soul.

Passage to India!
<BR>Lo soul for thee of tableaus twain,
<BR>I see in one the Suez canal initiated, open'd,
<BR>I see the procession of steamships, the Empress Eugenie's
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; leading the van,
<BR>I mark from on deck the strange landscape, the pure sky, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; level sand in the distance,
<BR>I pass swiftly the picturesque groups, the workmen gather'd,
<BR>The gigantic dredging machines.

<P>&nbsp;In one again, different, (yet thine, all thine, O soul, the same,)
<BR>I see over my own continent the Pacific railroad surmounting
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; every barrier,
<BR>I see continual trains of cars winding along the Platte carrying
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; freight and passengers,
<BR>I hear the locomotives rushing and roaring, and the shrill
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; steam-whistle,
<BR>I hear the echoes reverberate through the grandest scenery in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the world,
<BR>I cross the Laramie plains, I note the rocks in grotesque
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shapes, the buttes,
<BR>I see the plentiful larkspur and wild onions, the barren,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; colorless, sage-deserts,
<BR>I see in glimpses afar or towering immediately above me the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; great mountains, I see the Wind river and the Wahsatch
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mountains,
<BR>I see the Monument mountain and the Eagle's Nest, I pass
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Promontory, I ascend the Nevadas,
<BR>I scan the noble Elk mountain and wind around its base,
<BR>I see the Humboldt range, I thread the valley and cross the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; river,
<BR>I see the clear waters of lake Tahoe, I see forests of majestic
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pines,
<BR>Or crossing the great desert, the alkaline plains, I behold
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enchanting mirages of waters and meadows,
<BR>Marking through these and after all, in duplicate slender
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lines,
<BR>Bridging the three or four thousand miles of land travel,
<BR>Tying the Eastern to the Western sea,
<BR>The road between Europe and Asia.
<BR>(Ah Genoese thy dream! thy dream!
<BR>Centuries after thou art laid in thy grave,
<BR>The shore thou foundest verifies thy dream.)

Passage to India!
<BR>Struggles of many a captain, tales of many a sailor dead,
<BR>Over my mood stealing and spreading they come,
<BR>Like clouds and cloudlets in the unreach'd sky.

<P>&nbsp;Along all history, down the slopes,
<BR>As a rivulet running, sinking now, and now again to the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; surface rising,
<BR>A ceaseless thought, a varied train&amp;emdash;lo, soul, to thee, thy
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sight, they rise,
<BR>The plans, the voyages again, the expeditions;
<BR>Again Vasco de Gama sails forth,
<BR>Again the knowledge gain'd, the mariner's compass,
<BR>Lands found and nations born, thou born America,
<BR>For purpose vast, man's long probation fill'd,
<BR>Thou rondure of the world at last accomplish'd.

<P>&nbsp;
<CENTER></CENTER>

<CENTER>5</CENTER>
O vast Rondure, swimming in space,
<BR>Cover'd all over with visible power and beauty,
<BR>Alternate light and day and the teeming spiritual darkness,
<BR>Unspeakable high processions of sun and moon and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; countless stars above,
<BR>Below, the manifold grass and waters, animals, mountains,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trees,
<BR>With inscrutable purpose, some hidden prophetic intention,
<BR>Now first it seems my thought begins to span thee.
<BR>Down from the gardens of Asia descending radiating,
<BR>Adam and Eve appear, then their myriad progeny after
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them,
<BR>Wandering, yearning, curious, with restless explorations,
<BR>With questionings, baffled, formless, feverish, with never-
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; happy hearts,
<BR>With that sad incessant refrain, <I>Wherefore unsatisfied soul</I>?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and <I>Whither O mocking life</I>?
<BR>Ah who shall soothe these feverish children?
<BR>Who justify these restless explorations?
<BR>Who speak the secret of impassive earth?
<BR>Who bind it to us? what is this separate Nature so unnatural?
<BR>What is this earth to our affections? (unloving earth, without
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a throb to answer ours,
<BR>Cold earth, the place of graves.)

<P>&nbsp;Yet soul be sure the first intent remains, and shall be carried
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out,
<BR>Perhaps even now the time has arrived.
<BR>After the seas are all cross'd, (as they seem already cross'd,)
<BR>After the great captains and engineers have accomplish'd
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their work,
<BR>After the noble inventors, after the scientists, the chemist, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; geologist, ethnologist,
<BR>Finally shall come the poet worthy that name,
<BR>The true son of God shall come singing his songs.
<BR>Then not your deeds only O voyagers, O scientists and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inventors, shall be justified,
<BR>All these hearts as of fretted children shall be sooth'd,
<BR>All affection shall be fully responded to, the secret shall be
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; told,
<BR>All these separations and gaps shall be taken up and hook'd and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; link'd together,
<BR>The whole earth, this cold, impassive, voiceless earth, shall
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be completely justified,
<BR>Trinitas divine shall be gloriously accomplish'd and compacted
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by the true son of God, the poet,
<BR>(He shall indeed pass the straits and conquer the mountains,
<BR>He shall double the cape of Good Hope to some purpose,)
<BR>Nature and Man shall be disjoin'd and diffused no more,
<BR>The true son of God shall absolutely fuse them.

<CENTER></CENTER>

<CENTER>6</CENTER>
Year at whose wide-flung door I sing!
<BR>Year of the purpose accomplish'd!
<BR>Year of the marriage of continents, climates and oceans!
<BR>(No mere doge of Venice now wedding the Adriatic,)
<BR>I see O year in you the vast terraqueous globe given and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; giving all,
<BR>Europe to Asia, Africa join'd, and they to the New World,
<BR>The lands, geographies, dancing before you, holding a festival
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; garland,
<BR>As brides and bridegrooms hand in hand.

<P>&nbsp;Passage to India!
<BR>Cooling airs from Caucasus, far, soothing cradle of man,
<BR>The river Euphrates flowing, the past lit up again.

<P>&nbsp;Lo soul, the retrospect brought forward,
<BR>The old, most populous, wealthiest of earth's lands,
<BR>The streams of the Indus and the Ganges and their many
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; affluents,
<BR>(I my shores of America walking to-day behold, resuming all,)
<BR>The tale of Alexander on his warlike marches suddenly dying,
<BR>On one side China and on the other side Persia and Arabia,
<BR>To the south the great seas and the bay of Bengal,
<BR>The flowing literatures, tremendous epics, religions, castes,
<BR>Old occult Brahma interminably far back, the tender and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; junior Buddha,
<BR>Central and southern empires and all their belongings,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; possessors,
<BR>The wars of Tamerlane, the reign of Aurungzebe,
<BR>The traders, rulers, explorers, Moslems, Venetians, Byzantium,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Arabs, Portuguese,
<BR>The first travelers famous yet, Marco Polo, Batouta the Moor,
<BR>Doubts to be solv'd, the map incognita, blanks to be fill'd,
<BR>The foot of man unstay'd, the hands never at rest,
<BR>Thyself O soul that will not brook a challenge.

<P>&nbsp;The mediaeval navigators rise before me,
<BR>The world of 1492, with its awaken'd enterprise,
<BR>Something swelling in humanity now like the sap of the earth
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in spring,
<BR>The sunset splendor of chivalry declining.
<BR>And who art thou sad shade?
<BR>Gigantic, visionary, thyself a visionary,
<BR>With majestic limbs and pious beaming eyes,
<BR>Spreading around with every look of thine a golden world,
<BR>Enhuing it with gorgeous hues.

<P>&nbsp;As the chief histrion,
<BR>Down to the footlights walks in some great scena,
<BR>Dominating the rest I see the Admiral himself,
<BR>(History's type of courage, action, faith,)

<P>&nbsp;Behold him sail from Palos leading his little fleet,
<BR>His voyage behold, his return, his great fame,
<BR>His misfortunes, calumniators, behold him a prisoner,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chain'd,
<BR>Behold his dejection, poverty, death.

<P>&nbsp;(Curious in time I stand, noting the efforts of heroes,
<BR>Is the deferment long? bitter the slander, poverty, death?
<BR>Lies the seed unreck'd for centuries in the ground? lo, to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God's due occasion,
<BR>Uprising in the night, it sprouts, blooms,
<BR>And fills the earth with use and beauty.)

<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>7</CENTER>
Passage indeed O soul to primal thought,
<BR>Not lands and seas alone, thy own clear freshness,
<BR>The young maturity of brood and bloom,
<BR>To realms of budding bibles.

<P>&nbsp;O soul, repressless, I with thee and thou with me,
<BR>Thy circumnavigation of the world begin,
<BR>Of man, the voyage of his mind's return,
<BR>To reason's early paradise,
<BR>Back, back to wisdom's birth, to innocent intuitions,
<BR>Again with fair creation.

O we can wait no longer,
<BR>We too take ship O soul,
<BR>Joyous we too launch out on trackless seas,
<BR>Fearless for unknown shores on waves of ecstasy to sail,
<BR>Amid the wafting winds, (thou pressing me to thee, I thee to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me, O soul,)
<BR>Caroling free, singing our song of God,
<BR>Chanting our chant of pleasant exploration.
<BR>With laugh and many a kiss,
<BR>(Let others deprecate, let others weep for sin, remorse,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; humiliation,)
<BR>O soul thou pleasest me, I thee.
<BR>Ah more than any priest O soul we too believe in God,
<BR>But with the mystery of God we dare not dally.

<P>&nbsp;O soul thou pleasest me, I thee,
<BR>Sailing these seas or on the hills, or waking in the night,
<BR>Thoughts, silent thoughts, of Time and Space and Death, like
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; waters flowing,
<BR>Bear me indeed as through the regions infinite,
<BR>Whose air I breathe, whose ripples hear, lave me all over,
<BR>Bathe me O God in thee, mounting to thee,
<BR>I and my soul to range in range of thee.

<P>&nbsp;O Thou transcendent,
<BR>Nameless, the fibre and the breath,
<BR>Light of the light, shedding forth universes, thou centre of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them,
<BR>Thou mightier centre of the true, the good, the loving,
<BR>Thou moral, spiritual fountain&amp;emdash;affection's source&amp;emdash;thou
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reservoir,
<BR>(O pensive soul of me&amp;emdash;O thirst unsatisfied&amp;emdash;waitest
not
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there?
<BR>Waitest not haply for us somewhere there the Comrade perfect?)
<BR>Thou pulse&amp;emdash;thou motive of the stars, suns, systems,
<BR>That, circling, move in order, safe, harmonious,
<BR>Athwart the shapeless vastnesses of space,
<BR>How should I think, how breathe a single breath, how speak,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if, out of myself,
<BR>I could not launch, to those, superior universes?

<P>&nbsp;Swiftly I shrivel at the thought of God,
<BR>At Nature and its wonders, Time and Space and Death,
<BR>But that I, turning, call to thee O soul, thou actual Me,
<BR>And lo, thou gently masterest the orbs,
<BR>Thou matest Time, smilest content at Death,
<BR>And fillest, swellest full the vastnesses of Space.

<P>&nbsp;Greater than stars or suns,
<BR>Bounding O soul thou journeyest forth;
<BR>What love than thine and ours could wider amplify?
<BR>What aspirations, wishes, outvie thine and ours O soul?

<P>&nbsp;What dreams of the ideal? what plans of purity, perfection,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strength,
<BR>What cheerful willingness for others' sake to give up all?
<BR>For others' sake to suffer all?

<P>&nbsp;Reckoning ahead O soul, when thou, the time achiev'd,
<BR>The seas all cross'd, weather'd the capes, the voyage done,
<BR>Surrounded, copest, frontest God, yieldest, the aim attain'd,
<BR>As fill'd with friendship, love complete, the Elder Brother
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; found,
<BR>The Younger melts in fondness in his arms.

Passage to more than India!
<BR>Are thy wings plumed indeed for such far flights?
<BR>O soul, voyagest thou indeed on voyages like those?
<BR>Disportest thou on waters such as those?
<BR>Soundest below the Sanscrit and the Vedas?
<BR>Then have thy bent unleash'd.

<P>&nbsp;Passage to you, your shores, ye aged fierce enigmas!
<BR>Passage to you, to mastership of you, ye strangling problems!
<BR>You, strew'd with the wrecks of skeletons, that, living, never
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reach'd you.

<P>&nbsp;Passage to more than India!
<BR>O secret of the earth and sky!
<BR>Of you O waters of the sea! O winding creeks and rivers!
<BR>Of you O woods and fields! of you strong mountains of my
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; land!
<BR>Of you O prairies! of you gray rocks!
<BR>O morning red! O clouds! O rain and snows!
<BR>O day and night, passage to you!
<BR>O sun and moon and all you stars! Sirius and Jupiter!
<BR>Passage to you!

<P>&nbsp;Passage, immediate passage! the blood burns in my veins!
<BR>Away O soul! hoist instantly the anchor!
<BR>Cut the hawsers&amp;emdash;haul out&amp;emdash;shake out every sail!
<BR>Have we not stood here like trees in the ground long enough?

<P>&nbsp;Have we not grovel'd here long enough, eating and drinking
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like mere brutes?
<BR>Have we not darken'd and dazed ourselves with books long
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enough?

<P>&nbsp;Sail forth&amp;emdash;steer for the deep waters only,
<BR>Reckless O soul, exploring, I with thee, and thou with me,
<BR>For we are bound where mariner has not yet dared to go,
<BR>And we will risk the ship, ourselves and all.

<P>&nbsp;O my brave soul!
<BR>O farther farther sail!
<BR>O daring joy, but safe! are they not all the seas of God?
<BR>O farther, farther, farther sail!
