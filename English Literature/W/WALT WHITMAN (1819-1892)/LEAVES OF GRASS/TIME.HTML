<CENTER>1</CENTER>
To think of time&amp;emdash;of all that retrospection,
<BR>To think of to-day, and the ages continued henceforward.

<P>&nbsp;Have you guess'd you yourself would not continue?
<BR>Have you dreaded these earth-beetles?
<BR>Have you fear'd the future would be nothing to you?

<P>&nbsp;Is to-day nothing? is the beginningless past nothing?
<BR>If the future is nothing they are just as surely nothing.

<P>&nbsp;To think that the sun rose in the east&amp;emdash;that men and
women
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; were flexible, real, alive&amp;emdash;that
every thing was alive,
<BR>To think that you and I did not see, feel, think, nor bear our
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; part,
<BR>To think that we are now here and bear our part.

Not a day passes, not a minute or second without an
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; accouchement,
<BR>Not a day passes, not a minute or second without a corpse.

<P>&nbsp;The dull nights go over and the dull days also,
<BR>The soreness of lying so much in bed goes over,
<BR>The physician after long putting off gives the silent and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; terrible look for an answer,
<BR>The children come hurried and weeping, and the brothers
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and sisters are sent for,
<BR>Medicines stand unused on the shelf, (the camphor-smell has
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long pervaded the rooms,)
<BR>The faithful hand of the living does not desert the hand of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dying,
<BR>The twitching lips press lightly on the forehead of the dying,
<BR>The breath ceases and the pulse of the heart ceases,
<BR>The corpse stretches on the bed and the living look upon it,
<BR>It is palpable as the living are palpable.

<P>&nbsp;The living look upon the corpse with their eyesight,
<BR>But without eyesight lingers a different living and looks
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; curiously on the corpse.

<P>&nbsp;

<CENTER>3</CENTER>
To think the thought of death merged in the thought of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; materials,
<BR>To think of all these wonders of city and country, and others
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; taking great interest in them, and we taking no
interest
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in them.

<P>&nbsp;To think how eager we are in building our houses,
<BR>To think others shall be just as eager, and we quite
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; indifferent.

<P>&nbsp;(I see one building the house that serves him a few years, or
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seventy or eighty years at most,
<BR>I see one building the house that serves him longer than that.)

<P>&nbsp;Slow-moving and black lines creep over the whole earth&amp;emdash;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they never cease&amp;emdash;they are the burial
lines,
<BR>He that was President was buried, and he that is now President
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall surely be buried.

A reminiscence of the vulgar fate,
<BR>A frequent sample of the life and death of workmen,
<BR>Each after his kind.

<P>&nbsp;Cold dash of waves at the ferry-wharf, posh and ice in the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; river, half-frozen mud in the streets,
<BR>A gray discouraged sky overhead, the short last daylight of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; December,
<BR>A hearse and stages, the funeral of an old Broadway stagedriver,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the cortege mostly drivers.

<P>&nbsp;Steady the trot to the cemetery, duly rattles the death-bell,
<BR>The gate is pass'd, the new-dug grave is halted at, the living
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alight, the hearse uncloses,
<BR>The coffin is pass'd out, lower'd and settled, the whip is laid
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on the coffin, the earth is swiftly shovel'd in,
<BR>The mound above is flatted with the spades&amp;emdash;silence,
<BR>A minute&amp;emdash;no one moves or speaks&amp;emdash;it is done,
<BR>He is decently put away&amp;emdash;is there any thing more?

<P>&nbsp;He was a good fellow, free-mouth'd, quick-temper'd, not
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bad-looking,
<BR>Ready with life or death for a friend, fond of women, gambled,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ate hearty, drank hearty,
<BR>Had known what it was to be flush, grew low-spirited toward
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the last, sicken'd, was help'd by a contribution,
<BR>Died, aged forty-one years&amp;emdash;and that was his funeral.

<P>&nbsp;Thumb extended, finger uplifted, apron, cape, gloves, strap,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wet-weather clothes, whip carefully chosen,
<BR>Boss, spotter, starter, hostler, somebody loafing on you, you
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loafing on somebody, headway, man before and man
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; behind,
<BR>Good day's work, bad day's work, pet stock, mean stock,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; first out, last out, turning-in at night,
<BR>To think that these are so much and so nigh to other drivers,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and he there takes no interest in them.

The markets, the government, the working-man's wages, to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; think what account they are through our nights and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; days,
<BR>To think that other working-men will make just as great
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; account of them, yet we make little or no account.

<P>&nbsp;The vulgar and the refined, what you call sin and what
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you call goodness, to think how wide a difference,
<BR>To think the difference will still continue to others, yet we lie
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beyond the difference.

<P>&nbsp;To think how much pleasure there is,
<BR>Do you enjoy yourself in the city? or engaged in business? or
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; planning a nomination and election? or with your
wife
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and family?
<BR>Or with your mother and sisters? or in womanly housework?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or the beautiful maternal cares?
<BR>These also flow onward to others, you and I flow onward,
<BR>But in due time you and I shall take less interest in them.

<P>&nbsp;Your farm, profits, crops&amp;emdash;to think how engross'd you
are,
<BR>To think there will still be farms, profits, crops, yet for you of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what avail?

<P>&nbsp;
<CENTER></CENTER>

<CENTER>6</CENTER>
What will be will be well, for what is is well,
<BR>To take interest is well, and not to take interest shall be well.

<P>&nbsp;The domestic joys, the daily housework or business, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; building of houses, are not phantasms, they have
weight,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; form, location,
<BR>Farms, profits, crops, markets, wages, government, are none
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of them phantasms,
<BR>The difference between sin and goodness is no delusion,
<BR>The earth is not an echo, man and his life and all the things of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his life are well-consider'd.

<P>&nbsp;You are not thrown to the winds, you gather certainly and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; safely around yourself,
<BR>Yourself! yourself! yourself, for ever and ever!

It is not to diffuse you that you were born of your mother
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and father, it is to identify you,
<BR>It is not that you should be undecided, but that you should
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be decided,
<BR>Something long preparing and formless is arrived and form'd
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in you,
<BR>You are henceforth secure, whatever comes or goes.

<P>&nbsp;The threads that were spun are gather'd, the weft crosses the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; warp, the pattern is systematic.

<P>The preparations have every one been justified,
<BR>The orchestra have sufficiently tuned their instruments,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the baton has given the signal.

<P>&nbsp;The guest that was coming, he waited long, he is now housed,
<BR>He is one of those who are beautiful and happy, he is one of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those that to look upon and be with is enough.

<P>&nbsp;The law of the past cannot be eluded,
<BR>The law of the present and future cannot be eluded,
<BR>The law of the living cannot be eluded, it is eternal,
<BR>The law of promotion and transformation cannot be eluded,
<BR>The law of heroes and good-doers cannot be eluded,
<BR>The law of drunkards, informers, mean persons, not one iota
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thereof can be eluded.

Slow moving and black lines go ceaselessly over the earth,
<BR>Northerner goes carried and Southerner goes carried, and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they on the Atlantic side and they on the Pacific,
<BR>And they between, and all through the Mississippi country,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and all over the earth.

<P>&nbsp;The great masters and kosmos are well as they go, the heroes
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and good-doers are well,
<BR>The known leaders and inventors and the rich owners and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pious and distinguish'd may be well,
<BR>But there is more account than that, there is strict account of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all.

<P>&nbsp;The interminable hordes of the ignorant and wicked are not
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing,
<BR>The barbarians of Africa and Asia are not nothing,
<BR>The perpetual successions of shallow people are not nothing
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as they go.

<P>&nbsp;Of and in all these things,
<BR>I have dream'd that we are not to be changed so much, nor
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the law of us changed,
<BR>I have dream'd that heroes and good-doers shall be under the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; present and past law,
<BR>And that murderers, drunkards, liars, shall be under the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; present and past law,
<BR>For I have dream'd that the law they are under now is
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enough.

<P>&nbsp;And I have dream'd that the purpose and essence of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; known life, the transient,
<BR>Is to form and decide identity for the unknown life, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; permanent.

<P>&nbsp;If all came but to ashes of dung,
<BR>If maggots and rats ended us, then Alarum! for we are
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; betray'd,
<BR>Then indeed suspicion of death.

<P>&nbsp;Do you suspect death? if I were to suspect death I should die
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now,
<BR>Do you think I could walk pleasantly and well-suited toward
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; annihilation?

<P>&nbsp;Pleasantly and well-suited I walk,
<BR>Whither I walk I cannot define, but I know it is good,
<BR>The whole universe indicates that it is good,
<BR>The past and the present indicate that it is good.

<P>&nbsp;How beautiful and perfect are the animals!
<BR>How perfect the earth, and the minutest thing upon it!
<BR>What is called good is perfect, and what is called bad is just
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as perfect,
<BR>The vegetables and minerals are all perfect, and the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; imponderable fluids perfect;
<BR>Slowly and surely they have pass'd on to this, and slowly and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; surely they yet pass on.

I swear I think now that every thing without exception has an
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eternal soul!
<BR>The trees have, rooted in the ground! the weeds of the sea
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have! the animals!

<P>&nbsp;I swear I think there is nothing but immortality!
<BR>That the exquisite scheme is for it, and the nebulous float is
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for it, and the cohering is for it!
<BR>And all preparation is for it&amp;emdash;and identity is for it&amp;emdash;and
life
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and materials are altogether for it!
