<P>O <FONT SIZE=-1>TAKE</FONT> my hand Walt Whitman!
<BR>Such gliding wonders! such sights and sounds!
<BR>Such join'd unended links, each hook'd to the next,
<BR>Each answering all, each sharing the earth with all.

<P>&nbsp;What widens within you Walt Whitman?
<BR>What waves and soils exuding?
<BR>What climes? what persons and cities are here?
<BR>Who are the infants, some playing, some slumbering?
<BR>Who are the girls? who are the married women?
<BR>Who are the groups of old men going slowly with their arms
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; about each other's necks?
<BR>What rivers are these? what forests and fruits are these?
<BR>What are the mountains call'd that rise so high in the mists?
<BR>What myriads of dwellings are they fill'd with dwellers?

<P>Within me latitude widens, longitude lengthens,
<BR>Asia, Africa, Europe, are to the east&amp;emdash;America is provided
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for in the west,
<BR>Banding the bulge of the earth winds the hot equator,
<BR>Curiously north and south turn the axis-ends,
<BR>Within me is the longest day, the sun wheels in slanting rings,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it does not set for months,
<BR>Stretch'd in due time within me the midnight sun just rises
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; above the horizon and sinks again,
<BR>Within me zones, seas, cataracts, forests, volcanoes, groups,
<BR>Malaysia, Polynesia, and the great West Indian islands.

<BR>I hear the wheeze of the slave-coffle as the slaves march on, as
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the husky gangs pass on by twos and threes,
fasten'd
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; together with wrist-chains and ankle-chains,
<BR>I hear the Hebrew reading his records and psalms,
<BR>I hear the rhythmic myths of the Greeks, and the strong
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; legends of the Romans,
