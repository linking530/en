T<FONT SIZE=-1>HOU</FONT> orb full-dazzling! thou hot October noon!
<BR>Flooding with sheeny light the gray beach sand,
<BR>The sibilant near sea with vistas far and foam,
<BR>And tawny streaks and shades and spreading blue;
<BR>O sun of noon refulgent! my special word to thee.

<P>&nbsp;Hear me illustrious!
<BR>Thy lover me, for always I have loved thee,
<BR>Even as basking babe, then happy boy alone by some
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wood edge, thy touching-distant beams enough,
<BR>Or man matured, or young or old, as now to thee I
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; launch my invocation.

<P>&nbsp;(Thou canst not with thy dumbness me deceive,
<BR>I know before the fitting man all Nature yields,
<BR>Though answering not in words, the skies, trees,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hear his voice&amp;emdash;and thou O sun,
<BR>As for thy throes, thy perturbations, sudden breaks
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and shafts of flame gigantic,
<BR>I understand them, I know those flames, those
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; perturbations well.)

<P>&nbsp;Thou that with fructifying heat and light,
<BR>O'er myriad farms, o'er lands and waters North
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and South,
<BR>O'er Mississippi's endless course, o'er Texas'
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grassy plains, Kanada's woods,
<BR>O'er all the globe that turns its face to thee shining
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in space,
<BR>Thou that impartially infoldest all, not only continents,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seas,
<BR>Thou that to grapes and weeds and little wild
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flowers givest so liberally,

<P>&nbsp;Shed, shed thyself on mine and me, with but a fleeting
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ray out of thy million millions,
<BR>Strike though these chants.

<P>&nbsp;Nor only launch thy subtle dazzle and thy strength
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for these,
<BR>Prepare the later afternoon of me myself&amp;emdash;

FACES</H2></CENTER>

<CENTER>1</CENTER>


<P>S<FONT SIZE=-1>AUNTERING</FONT> the pavement or riding the country by-road,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lo, such faces!
<BR>Faces of friendship, precision, caution, sauvity, ideality,
<BR>The spiritual-prescient face, the always welcome common
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; benevolent face,
<BR>The face of the singing of music, the grand faces of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; natural lawyers and judges broad at the back-top,
<BR>The faces of hunters and fishers bulged at the brows,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the shaved blanch'd faces of orthodox citizens,
<BR>The pure, extravagant, yearning, questioning artist's face,
<BR>The ugly face of some beautiful soul, the handsome
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; detested or despised face,
<BR>The sacred faces of infants, the illuminated face of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mother of many children,
<BR>The face of an amour, the face of veneration,
<BR>The face as of a dream, the face of an immobile rock,
<BR>The face withdrawn of its good and bad, a castrated
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; face,
<BR>A wild hawk, his wings clipp'd by the clipper,
<BR>A stallion that yielded at last to the thongs and knife
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the gelder.

<P>&nbsp;Sauntering the pavement thus, or crossing the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ceaseless ferry, faces and faces and faces,
<BR>I see them and complain not, and am content with all.

<P>&nbsp;
<CENTER>2</CENTER>


<P>Do you suppose I could be content with all if I
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thought them their own final&egrave;?

<P>&nbsp;This now is too lamentable a face for a man,
<BR>Some abject louse asking leave to be, cringing for
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it,
<BR>Some milk-nosed maggot blessing what lets it wrig
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to its hole.

<P>&nbsp;This face is a dog's snout sniffing for garbage,
<BR>Snakes nest in that mouth, I hear the sibilant threat.

<P>&nbsp;This face is a haze more chill than the arctic sea,
<BR>Its sleepy and wabbling icebergs crunch as they go.

<P>&nbsp;This is a face of bitter herbs, this an emetic, they
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; need no label,
<BR>And more of the drug-shelf, laudanum, caoutchouc,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or hog'slard.

<P>&nbsp;This face is an epilepsy, its wordless tongue gives
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out the earthly cry,
<BR>Its veins down the neck distend, its eyes roll till
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they show nothing but their whites,
<BR>Its teeth grit, the palms of the hands are cut by the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turn'd-in nails,
<BR>The man falls struggling and foaming to the ground,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while he speculates well.

<P>&nbsp;This face is bitten by vermin and worms,
<BR>And this is some murderer's knife with a half-pull'd
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scabbard.

<P>&nbsp;This face owes to the sexton his dismalest fee,
<BR>An unceasing death-bell tolls there.

<P>&nbsp;
<CENTER>3</CENTER>


<P>Features of my equals would you trick me with your
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; creas'd and cadaverous march?
<BR>Well, you cannot trick me.

<P>&nbsp;I see your rounded never-erased flow,
<BR>I see 'neath the rims of your haggard and mean
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; disguises.

<P>&nbsp;Splay and twist as you like, poke with the tangling
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fores of fishes or rats,
<BR>You'll be unmuzzled, you certainly will.

<P>&nbsp;I saw the face of the most smear'd and slobbering
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; idiot they had at the asylum,
<BR>And I knew for my consolation what they knew not,
<BR>I knew of the agents that emptied and broke my
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; brother,
<BR>The same wait to clear the rubbish from the fallen
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tenement,
<BR>And I shall look again in a score or two of ages,
<BR>And I shall meet the real landlord perfect and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unharm'd, every inch as good as myself.

<P>&nbsp;
<CENTER>4</CENTER>


<P>The Lord advances, and yet advances,
<BR>Always the shadow in front, always the reach'd
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hand bringing up the laggards.

<P>&nbsp;Out of this face emerge banners and horses&amp;emdash;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O superb! I see what is coming,
<BR>I see the high pioneer-caps, see staves of runners
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clearing the way,
<BR>I hear victorious drums.

<P>&nbsp;This face is a life-boat,
<BR>This is the face commanding and bearded, it asks no
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; odds of the rest,
<BR>This face is flavor'd fruit ready for eating,
<BR>This face of a healthy honest boy is the programme
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of all good.

<P>&nbsp;These faces bear testimony slumbering or awake,
<BR>They show their descent from the Master himself.

<P>&nbsp;Off the word I have spoken I except not one&amp;emdash;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; red, white, black, are all deific,
<BR>In each house is the ovum, it comes forth after a
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thousand years.

<P>&nbsp;Spots or cracks at the windows do not disturb me,
<BR>Tall and sufficient stand behind and make signs to me,
<BR>I read the promise and patiently wait.

<P>&nbsp;This is a full-grown lily's face,
<BR>She speaks to the limber-hipp'd man near the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; garden pickets,
<BR><I>Come here</I> she blushingly cries, <I>Come night</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to me limberhipp'd man,</I>
<BR><I>Stand at my side till I lean as high as I can</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; upon you</I>,
<BR><I>Fill me with albescent honey, bend down to me</I>,
<BR><I>Rub to me with your chafing beard, rub to my</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; breast and shoulders</I>.

<P>&nbsp;
<CENTER>5</CENTER>


<P>The old face of the mother of many children,
<BR>Whist! I am fully content.

<P>&nbsp;Lull'd and late is the smoke of the First-day morning,
<BR>It hangs low over the rows of trees by the fences,
<BR>It hangs thin by the sassafras and wild-cherry and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cat-brier under them.

<P>&nbsp;I saw the rich ladies in full dress at the soiree,
<BR>I heard what the singers were singing so long,
<BR>Heard who sprang in crimson youth from the white
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; froth and the water-blue.

<P>&nbsp;Behold a woman!
<BR>She looks out from her quaker cap, her face is
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clearer and more beautiful than the sky.

<P>&nbsp;She sits in an armchair under the shaded porch
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the farmhouse,
<BR>The sun just shines on her old white head.

<P>&nbsp;Her ample gown is of cream-hued linen,
<BR>Her grandsons raised the flax, and her grand-
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; daughters spin it with the distaff and the wheel.

<P>&nbsp;The melodious character of the earth,
<BR>The finish beyond which philosophy cannot go
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and does not wish to go,
<BR>The justified mother of men.

<P>H<FONT SIZE=-1>ARK</FONT>, some wild trumpeter, some strange musician,
<BR>Hovering unseen in air, vibrates capricious tunes
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to-night.

<P>&nbsp;I hear thee trumpeter, listening alert I catch thy
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; notes,
<BR>Now pouring, whirling like a tempest round me,
<BR>Now low, subdued, now in the distance lost.

<P>Come nearer bodiless one, haply in thee resounds
<BR>Some dead composer, haply thy pensive life
<BR>Was fill'd with aspirations high, unform'd ideals,
<BR>Waves, oceans musical, chaotically surging,
<BR>That now ecstatic ghost, close to me bending,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thy cornet echoing, pealing,
<BR>Gives out to no one's ears but mine, but freely
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gives to mine,
<BR>That I may thee translate.

<P>Blow trumpeter free and clear, I follow thee,
<BR>While at thy liquid prelude, glad, serene,
<BR>The fretting world, the streets, the noisy hours of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; day withdraw,
<BR>A holy calm descends like dew upon me,
<BR>I walk in cool refreshing night the walks of Paradise,
<BR>I scent the grass, the moist air and the roses;
<BR>Thy song expands my numb'd imbonded spirit,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thou freest, launchest me,
<BR>Floating and basking upon heaven's lake.

<P>Blow again trumpeter! and for my sensuous eyes,
<BR>Bring the old pageants, show the feudal world.

<P>&nbsp;What charm thy music works! thou makest pass
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; before me,
<BR>Ladies and cavaliers long dead, barons are in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their castle halls, the troubadours are singing,
<BR>Arm'd knights go forth to redress wrongs, some
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in quest of the holy Graal;
<BR>I see the tournament, I see the contestants incased
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in heavy armor seated on stately champing
horses,
<BR>I hear the shouts, the sounds of blows and smiting
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; steel;

<P>&nbsp;I see the Crusaders' tumultuous armies&amp;emdash;hark,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how the cymbals clang,
<BR>Lo, where the monks walk in advance, bearing the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cross on high.

<P>Blow again trumpeter! and for thy theme,
<BR>Take now the enclosing theme of all, the solvent
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the setting,
<BR>Love, that is pulse of all, the sustenance and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the pang,
<BR>The heart of man and woman all for love,
<BR>No other theme but love&amp;emdash;knitting,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enclosing, all-diffusing love.

<P>&nbsp;O how the immortal phantoms crowd around me!
<BR>I see the vast alembic ever working, I see and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; know the flames that heat the world,
<BR>The glow, the blush, the beating hearts of lovers,
<BR>So blissful happy some, and some so silent, dark,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and nigh to death;
<BR>Love, that is all the earth to lovers&amp;emdash;love,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that mocks time and space,
<BR>Love, that is day and night&amp;emdash;love, that is
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sun and moon and stars,
<BR>Love, that is crimson, sumptuous, sick with perfume,
<BR>No other words but words of love, no other thought
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but love.

<P>Blow again trumpeter&amp;emdash;conjure war's alarums.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thunder rolls,
<BR>Lo, where the arm'd men hasten&amp;emdash;lo, mid the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clouds of dust the glint of bayonets,
<BR>I see the grime-faced cannoneers, I mark the rosy flash
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; amid the smoke, I hear the cracking of the
guns;
<BR>Nor war alone&amp;emdash;thy fearful music-song, wild
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prayer, brings every sight of fear,
<BR>The deeds of ruthless brigands, rapine, murder&amp;emdash;

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; below deck the terrible tableaus.

<P>O trumpeter, methinks I am myself the instrument
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thou playest,
<BR>Thou melt'st my heart, my brain&amp;emdash;thou movest,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drawest, changest them at will;
<BR>And now thy sullen notes send darkness through me,
<BR>Thou takest away all cheering light, all hope,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; opprest of the whole earth,
<BR>I feel the measureless shame and humiliation of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my race, it becomes all mine,

<BR>Utter defeat upon me weighs&amp;emdash;all lost&amp;emdash;

<BR>Rouse up my slow belief, give me some vision of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the future,
<BR>Give me for once its prophecy and joy.

<P>&nbsp;O glad, exulting, culminating song!
<BR>A vigor more than earth's is in thy notes,
<BR>Marches of victory&amp;emdash;man disenthral'd
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;emdash;the conqueror at last,
<BR>Hymns to the universal God from universal man

O <FONT SIZE=-1>ME</FONT>, man of slack faith so long,
<BR>Standing aloof, denying portions so long,
<BR>Only aware to-day of compact all-diffused truth,
<BR>Discovering to-day there is no lie or form of lie,

<BR>Or as any law of the earth or any natural production
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the earth does.

<P>&nbsp;(This is curious and may not be realized immediately,

<BR>I feel in myself that I represent falsehoods equally
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the rest,
<BR>And that the universe does.)

<P>&nbsp;Where has fail'd a perfect return indifferent of lies
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or the truth?
<BR>Is it upon the ground, or in water or fire? or in the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spirit of man? or in the meat and blood?

<P>&nbsp;Meditating among liars and retreating sternly into
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; myself, I see that there are really no liars
or
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lies after all,
<BR>And that nothing fails its perfect return, and that
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what are called lies are perfect returns,
<BR>And that each thing exactly represents itself and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what has preceded it,
<BR>And that the truth includes all, and is compact just
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as much as space is compact,
<BR>And that there is no flaw or vacuum in the amount
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the truth&amp;emdash;but that all is truth
without

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O terrific Ideal,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; denser wars,
<BR>Perhaps to engage in time in still more dreadful
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contests, dangers,
<BR>Longer campaigns and crises, labors beyond all

<BR>Around me I hear that eclat of the world, politics,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; produce,
<BR>The announcements of recognized things, science,
<BR>The approved growth of cities and the spread of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inventions.

<P>&nbsp;I see the ships, (they will last a few years,)
<BR>The vast factories with their foremen and workmen,
<BR>And hear the indorsement of all, and do not object
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to it.

<P>&nbsp;But I too announce solid things,
<BR>Science, ships, politics, cities, factories, are not
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing,
<BR>Like a grand procession to music of distant bugles
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pouring, triumphantly moving, and grander
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heaving in sight,
<BR>They stand for realities&amp;emdash;all is as it should be.

<P>&nbsp;Then my realities;
<BR>What else is so real as mine?
<BR>Libertad and the divine average, freedom to every
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; slave on the face of the earth,
<BR>The rapt promises and lumin&egrave; of seers, the spiritual
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; world, these centuries-lasting songs,
<BR>And our visions, the visions of poets, the most
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; solid announcements of any.
