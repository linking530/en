<P>A C<FONT SIZE=-1>ALIFORNIA</FONT> song,
<BR>A prophecy and indirection, a thought impalpable to breathe
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as air,
<BR>A chorus of dryads, fading, departing, or hamadryads departing,
<BR>A murmuring, fateful, giant voice, out of the earth and sky,
<BR>Voice of a mighty dying tree in the redwood forest dense.

<P>&nbsp;<I>Farewell my brethren</I>,
<BR><I>Farewell O earth and sky, farewell ye neighboring waters</I>,
<BR><I>My time has ended, my term has come</I>.

<P>&nbsp;Along the northern coast,
<BR>Just back from the rock-bound shore and the caves,
<BR>In the saline air from the sea in the Mendocino country,
<BR>With the surge for base and accompaniment low and hoarse,
<BR>With crackling blows of axes sounding musically driven by
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strong arms,
<BR>Riven deep by the sharp tongues of the axes, there in the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; redwood forest dense,
<BR>I heard the mighty tree its death-chant chanting.

<P>&nbsp;The choppers heard not, the camp shanties echoed not,
<BR>The quick-ear'd teamsters and chain and jack-screw men
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heard not,
<BR>As the wood-spirits came from their haunts of a thousand
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; years to join the refrain,
<BR>But in my soul I plainly heard.

<P>&nbsp;Murmuring out of its myriad leaves,
<BR>Down from its lofty top rising two hundred feet high,
<BR>Out of its stalwart trunk and limbs, out of its
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; foot-thick bark,

<P>&nbsp;That chant of the seasons and time, chant not of the past
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only but the future.

<P>&nbsp;<I>You untold life of me</I>,
<BR><I>And all you venerable and innocent joys</I>,
<BR><I>Perennial hardy life of me with joys 'mid rain and</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; many a summer sun</I>,
<BR><I>And the white snows and night and the wild winds</I>;
<BR><I>O the great patient rugged joys, my soul's strong joys</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unreck'd by man</I>,
<BR><I>(For know I bear the soul befitting me, I too have</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; consciousness, identity</I>,
<BR><I>And all the rocks and mountains have, and all the earth,)</I>
<BR><I>Joys of the life befitting me and brothers mine</I>,
<BR><I>Our time, our term has come</I>.

<P>&nbsp;<I>Nor yield we mournfully majestic brothers</I>,
<BR><I>We who have grandly fill'd our time</I>;
<BR><I>With Nature's calm content, with tacit huge delight</I>,
<BR><I>We welcome what we wrought for through the past</I>,
<BR><I>And leave the field for them</I>.
<BR><I>For them predicted long</I>,
<BR><I>For a superber race, they too to grandly fill their time</I>,
<BR><I>For them we abdicate, in them ourselves ye forest kings!</I>
<BR><I>In them these skies and airs, these mountain peaks,</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shasta, Nevadas</I>,
<BR><I>These huge precipitious cliffs, this amplitude, these</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; valleys, far Yosemite</I>,
<BR><I>To be in them absorb'd, assimilated</I>.

<P>&nbsp;Then to a loftier strain,
<BR>Still prouder, more ecstatic rose the chant,
<BR>As if the heirs, the deities of the West,
<BR>Joining with master-tongue bore part.

<P>&nbsp;<I>Not wan from Asia's fetiches</I>,
<BR><I>Nor red from Europe's old dynastic slaughter-house</I>,
<BR><I>(Area of murder-plots of thrones, with scent left yet</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of wars and scaffolds everywhere,)</I>
<BR><I>But come from Nature's long and harmless throes,</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; peacefully builded thence</I>,

<P>&nbsp;<I>These virgin lands, lands of the Western shore</I>,
<BR><I>To the new culminating man, to you, the empire new</I>,
<BR><I>You promis'd long, we pledge, we dedicate</I>.

<P>&nbsp;<I>You occult deep volitions</I>,
<BR><I>You average spiritual manhood, purpose of all, pois'd</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on yourself, giving not taking law</I>,
<BR><I>You womanhood divine, mistress and source of all, whence</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; life and love and aught that comes from
life and love</I>,
<BR><I>You unseen moral essence of all the vast materials of</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; America, (age upon age working in death
the same as life</I>,)
<BR><I>You that, sometimes known, oftener unknown, really shape and</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mould the New World, adjusting it to Time
and Space</I>,
<BR><I>You hidden national will lying in your abysms, conceal'd</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but ever alert</I>,
<BR><I>You past and present purposes tenaciously pursued, may-be</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unconscious of yourselves</I>,
<BR><I>Unswerv'd by all the passing errors, perturbations of the</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; surface</I>;
<BR><I>You vital, universal, deathless germs, beneath all creeds,</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arts, statutes, literatures</I>,
<BR><I>Here build your homes for good, establish here, these areas</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; entire, lands of the Western shore</I>,
<BR><I>We pledge, we dedicate to you</I>.

<P>&nbsp;<I>For man of you, your characteristic race</I>,
<BR><I>Here may he hardy, sweet, gigantic grow, here tower</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; proportionate to Nature</I>,
<BR><I>Here climb the vast pure spaces unconfined, uncheck'd by</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wall or roof</I>,
<BR><I>Here laugh with storm or sun, here joy, here patiently inure</I>,
<BR><I>Here heed himself, unfold himself, (not others' formulas</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heed,) here fill his time</I>,
<BR><I>To duly fall, to aid, unreck'd at last</I>,
<BR><I>To disappear, to serve</I>.

<P>&nbsp;Thus on the northern coast,
<BR>In the echo of teamsters' calls and the clinking chains, and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the music of choppers' axes,

<P>&nbsp;The falling trunk and limbs, the crash, the muffled shriek,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the groan,
<BR>Such words combined from the redwood-tree, as of voices
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ecstatic, ancient and rustling,
<BR>The century-lasting, unseen dryads, singing, withdrawing,
<BR>All their recesses of forests and mountains leaving,
<BR>From the Cascade range to the Wasatch, or Idaho far, or
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Utah,
<BR>To the deities of the modern henceforth yielding,
<BR>The chorus and indications, the vistas of coming humanity,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the settlements, features all,
<BR>In the Mendocino woods I caught.

<P>The flashing and golden pageant of California,
<BR>The sudden and gorgeous drama, the sunny and ample lands,
<BR>The long and varied stretch from Puget sound to Colorado
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; south,
<BR>Lands bathed in sweeter, rarer, healthier air, valleys and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mountain cliffs,
<BR>The fields of Nature long prepared and fallow, the silent,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cyclic chemistry,
<BR>The slow and steady ages plodding, the unoccupied surface
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ripening, the rich ores forming beneath;
<BR>At last the New arriving, assuming, taking possession,
<BR>A swarming and busy race settling and organizing everywhere,
<BR>Ships coming in from the whole round world, and going out
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the whole world,
<BR>To India and China and Australia and the thousand island
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; paradises of the Pacific,
<BR>Populous cities, the latest inventions, the steamers on the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rivers, the railroads, with many a thrifty
farm, with machinery,
<BR>And wood and wheat and the grape, and diggings of yellow gold.

<P>But more in you than these, lands of the Western shore,
<BR>(These but the means, the implements, the standing-ground,)

<P>&nbsp;I see in you, certain to come, the promise of thousands of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; years, till now deferr'd,
<BR>Promis'd to be fulfill'd, our common kind, the race.

<P>&nbsp;The new society at last, proportionate to Nature,
<BR>In man of you, more than your mountain peaks or stalwart
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trees imperial,
<BR>In woman more, far more, than all your gold or vines, or
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; even vital air.

<P>&nbsp;Fresh come, to a new world indeed, yet long prepared,
<BR>I see the genius of the modern, child of the real and ideal,
<BR>Clearing the ground for broad humanity, the true America,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heir of the past so grand,
<BR>To build a grander future.
