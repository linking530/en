A<FONT SIZE=-1>LWAYS</FONT> our old feuillage!
<BR>Always Florida's green peninsula&amp;emdash;always the priceless delta
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of Louisiana&amp;emdash;always the cotton-fields
of Alabama and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Texas,
<BR>Always California's golden hills and hollows, and the silver
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mountains of New Mexico&amp;emdash;always
soft-breath'd Cuba,
<BR>Always the vast slope drain'd by the Southern sea, inseparable
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the slopes drain'd by the Eastern and
Western seas,
<BR>The area the eighty-third year of these States, the three and a half
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; millions of square miles,
<BR>The eighteen thousand miles of sea-coast and bay-coast on the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; main, the thirty thousand miles of river navigation,
<BR>The seven millions of distinct families and the same number of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dwellings&amp;emdash;always these, and more,
branching forth
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; into numberless branches,
<BR>Always the free range and diversity&amp;emdash;always the continent
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of Democracy;
<BR>Always the prairies, pastures, forests, vast cities, travelers, Kanada,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the snows;
<BR>Always these compact lands tied at the hips with the belt stringing
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the huge oval lakes;
<BR>Always the West with strong native persons, the increasing density
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there, the habitans, friendly, threatening,
ironical, scorning invaders;
<BR>All sights, South, North, East&amp;emdash;all deeds promiscuously done
at
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all times,
<BR>All characters, movements, growths, a few noticed, myriads unnoticed,
<BR>Through Mannahatta's streets I walking, these things gathering,
<BR>On interior rivers by night in the glare of pine knots, steam-boats
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wooding up,
<BR>Sunlight by day on the valley of the Susquehanna, and on the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; valleys of the Potomac and Rappahannock, and
the valleys of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Roanoke and Delaware,

<P>&nbsp;In their northerly wilds beasts of prey haunting the Adirondacks
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the hills, or lapping the Saginaw waters to
drink,
<BR>In a lonesome inlet a sheldrake lost from the flock, sitting on
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the water rocking silently,
<BR>In farmers' barns oxen in the stable, their harvest labor done,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they rest standing, they are too tired,
<BR>Afar on arctic ice the she-walrus lying drowsily while her cubs
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; play around,
<BR>The hawk sailing where men have not yet sail'd, the farthest polar
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sea, ripply, crystalline, open, beyond the
floes,
<BR>White drift spooning ahead where the ship in the tempest dashes,
<BR>On solid land what is done in cities as the bells strike midnight
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; together,
<BR>In primitive woods the sounds there also sounding, the howl of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wolf, the scream of the panther, and the hoarse
bellow of the elk,
<BR>In winter beneath the hard blue ice of Moosehead lake, in summer
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; visible through the clear waters, the great
trout swimming,
<BR>In lower latitudes in warmer air in the Carolinas the large black
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; buzzard floating slowly high beyond the tree
tops,
<BR>Below, the red cedar festoon'd with tylandria, the pines and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cypresses growing out of the white sand that
spreads far and flat,
<BR>Rude boats descending the big Pedee, climbing plants, parasites with
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; color'd flowers and berries enveloping huge
trees,
<BR>The waving drapery on the live-oak trailing long and low, noiselessly
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; waved by the wind,
<BR>The camp of Georgia wagoners just after dark, the supperfires and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the cooking and eating by whites and negroes,
<BR>Thirty or forty great wagons, the mules, cattle, horses, feeding
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from troughs,
<BR>The shadows, gleams, up under the leaves of the old sycamore-trees,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the flames with the black smoke from the pitch-pine
curling and rising;
<BR>Southern fishermen fishing, the sounds and inlets of North Carolina's
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; coast, the shad-fishery and the herring-fishery,
the large
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sweep-seines, the windlasses on shore work'd
by horses, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clearing, curing, and packing-houses;
<BR>Deep in the forest in piney woods turpentine dropping from the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; incisions in the trees, there are the turpentine
works,
<BR>There are the negroes at work in good health, the ground in all
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; directions is cover'd with pine straw;
<BR>In Tennessee and Kentucky slaves busy in the coalings, at the forge,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by the furnace-blaze, or at the corn-shucking,
<BR>In Virginia, the planter's son returning after a long absence, joyfully
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; welcom'd and kiss'd by the aged mulatto nurse,
<BR>On rivers boatmen safely moor'd at nightfall in their boats under
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shelter of high banks,
<BR>Some of the younger men dance to the sound of the banjo or fiddle,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; others sit on the gunwale smoking and talking;
<BR>Late in the afternoon the mocking-bird, the American mimic, singing
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the Great Dismal Swamp,
<BR>There are the greenish waters, the resinous odor, the plenteous moss,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the cypress-tree, and the juniper-tree;
<BR>Northward, young men of Mannahatta, the target company from
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an excursion returning home at evening, the
musket-muzzles
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all bear bunches of flowers presented by women;
<BR>Children at play, or on his father's lap a young boy fallen asleep,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (how his lips move! how he smiles in his sleep!)
<BR>The scout riding on horseback over the plains west of the Mississippi,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he ascends a knoll and sweeps his eyes around;
<BR>California life, the miner, bearded, dress'd in his rude costume,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the stanch California friendship, the sweet
air, the graves one
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in passing meets solitary just aside the horse-path;
<BR>Down in Texas the cotton-field, the negro-cabins, drivers driving
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mules or oxen before rude carts, cotton bales
piled on banks
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and wharves;
<BR>Encircling all, vast-darting up and wide, the American Soul,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with equal hemispheres, one Love, one Dilation
or Pride;
<BR>In arriere the peace-talk with the Iroquois the aborigines, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; calumet, the pipe of good-will, arbitration,
and indorsement,

<P>&nbsp;The sachem blowing the smoke first toward the sun and then
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; toward the earth,
<BR>The drama of the scalp-dance enacted with painted faces and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; guttural exclamations,
<BR>The setting out of the war-party, the long and stealthy march,
<BR>The single file, the swinging hatchets, the surprise and slaughter
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of enemies;
<BR>All the acts, scenes, ways, persons, attitudes of these States,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reminiscences, institutions,
<BR>All these States compact, every square mile of these States
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without excepting a particle;
<BR>Me pleas'd, rambling in lanes and country fields, Paumanok's fields,
<BR>Observing the spiral flight of two little yellow butterflies shuffling
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; between each other, ascending high in the
air,
<BR>The darting swallow, the destroyer of insects, the fall traveler
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; southward but returning northward early in
the spring,
<BR>The country boy at the close of the day driving the herd of cows
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and shouting to them as they loiter to browse
by the roadside,
<BR>The city wharf, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Charleston,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New Orleans, San Francisco,
<BR>The departing ships when the sailors heave at the capstan;
<BR>Evening&amp;emdash;me in my room&amp;emdash;the setting sun,
<BR>The setting summer sun shining in my open window, showing the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; swarm of flies, suspended, balancing in the
air in the centre of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the room, darting athwart, up and down, casting
swift shadows,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in specks on the opposite wall where the shine
is;
<BR>The athletic American matron speaking in public to crowds of listeners,
<BR>Males, females, immigrants, combinations, the copiousness, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; individuality of the States, each for itself&amp;emdash;the
money-makers,
<BR>Factories, machinery, the mechanical forces, the windlass, lever,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pulley, all certainties,
<BR>The certainty of space, increase, freedom, futurity,
<BR>In space the sporades, the scatter'd islands, the stars&amp;emdash;on
the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; firm earth, the lands, my lands,

<P>&nbsp;O lands! all so dear to me&amp;emdash;what you are, (whatever
it is,) I
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; putting it at random in these songs, become
a part of that,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whatever it is,
<BR>Southward there, I screaming, with wings slow flapping, with the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; myriads of gulls wintering along the coasts
of Florida,
<BR>Otherways there atwixt the banks of the Arkansas, the Rio Grande,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Nueces, the Brazos, the Tombigbee, the
Red River, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saskatchewan or the Osage, I with the spring
waters laughing
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and skipping and running,
<BR>Northward, on the sands, on some shallow bay of Paumanok, I with
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; parties of snowy herons wading in the wet
to seek worms and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; aquatic plants,
<BR>Retreating, triumphantly twittering, the king-bird, from piercing the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; crow with its bill, for amusement&amp;emdash;and
I triumphantly
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; twittering,
<BR>The migrating flock of wild geese alighting in autumn to refresh
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; themselves, the body of the flock feed, the
sentinels outside
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; move around with erect heads watching, and
are from time to time
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reliev'd by other sentinels&amp;emdash;and
I feeding and taking turns
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the rest,
<BR>In Kanadian forests the moose, large as an ox, corner'd by hunters,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rising desperately on his hind-feet, and plunging
with his fore-feet,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the hoofs as sharp as knives&amp;emdash;and
I, plunging at the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hunters, corner'd and desperate,
<BR>In the Mannahatta, streets, piers, shipping, store-houses, and the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; countless workmen working in the shops,
<BR>And I too of the Mannahatta, singing thereof&amp;emdash;and no
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; less in myself than the whole of the Mannahatta
in itself,
<BR>Singing the song of These, my ever-united lands&amp;emdash;my
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; body no more inevitably united, part to part,
and made out
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of a thousand diverse contributions one identity,
any more
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than my lands are inevitably united and made
O<FONT SIZE=-1>NE IDENTITY</FONT>;
<BR>Nativities, climates, the grass of the great pastoral Plains,
<BR>Cities, labors, death, animals, products, war, good and evil
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;emdash;these me,
<BR>These affording, in all their particulars, the old feuillage to me
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and to America, how can I do less than pass
the clew of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; union of them, to afford the like to you?

<P>&nbsp;Whoever you are! how can I but offer you divine leaves, that you
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; also be eligible as I am?
<BR>How can I but as here chanting, invite you for yourself to collect
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bouquets of the incomparable feuillage of
these States?
