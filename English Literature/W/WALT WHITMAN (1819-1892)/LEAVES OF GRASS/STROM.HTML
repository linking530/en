P<FONT SIZE=-1>roud</FONT> music of the storm,
<BR>Blast that careers so free, whistling across the prairies,
<BR>Strong hum of forest tree-tops&amp;emdash;wind of the mountains,
<BR>Personified dim shapes&amp;emdash;you hidden orchestras,
<BR>You serenades of phantoms with instruments alert,
<BR>Bending with Nature's rhythmus all the tongues of nations;
<BR>You chords left as by vast composers&amp;emdash;you choruses,
<BR>You formless, free, religious dances&amp;emdash;you from the Orient,
<BR>You undertone of rivers, roar of pouring cataracts,
<BR>You sounds from distant guns with galloping cavalry,
<BR>Echoes of camps with all the different bugle-calls,
<BR>Trooping tumultuous, filling the midnight late, bending me
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; powerless,
<BR>Entering my lonesome slumber-chamber, why have you
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seiz'd me?

<P>&nbsp;

Come forward O my soul, and let the rest retire,
<BR>Listen, lose not, it is toward thee they tend,
<BR>Parting the midnight, entering my slumber-chamber,
<BR>For thee they sing and dance O soul.

<P>&nbsp;A festival song,
<BR>The duet of the bridegroom and the bride, a marriage-
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; march,
<BR>With lips of love, and hearts of lovers fill'd to the brim with
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; love,
<BR>The red-flush'd cheeks and perfumes, the cortege swarming
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; full of friendly faces young and old,
<BR>To flutes' clear notes and sounding harps' cantabile.

<P>&nbsp;Now loud approaching drums,
<BR>Victoria! see'st thou in powder-smoke the banners torn but
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flying? the rout of the baffled?
<BR>Hearest those shouts of a conquering army?
<BR>(Ah soul, the sobs of women, the wounded groaning in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; agony,
<BR>The hiss and crackle of flames, the blacken'd ruins, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; embers of cities,
<BR>The dirge and desolation of mankind.)

<P>&nbsp;Now airs antique and mediaeval fill me,
<BR>I see and hear old harpers with their harps at Welsh festivals,
<BR>I hear the minnesingers singing their lays of love,
<BR>I hear the minstrels, gleemen, troubadours, of the middle
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ages.

<P>&nbsp;Now the great organ sounds,
<BR>Tremulous, while underneath, (as the hid footholds of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; earth,
<BR>On which arising rest, and leaping forth depend,
<BR>All shapes of beauty, grace and strength, all hues we know,
<BR>Green blades of grass and warbling birds, children that gambol
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and play, the clouds of heaven above,)
<BR>The strong base stands, and its pulsations intermits not,
<BR>Bathing, supporting, merging all the rest, maternity of all the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rest,
<BR>And with it every instrument in multitudes,
<BR>The players playing, all the world's musicians,
<BR>The solemn hymns and masses rousing adoration,
<BR>All passionate heart-chants, sorrowful appeals,
<BR>The measureless sweet vocalists of ages,
<BR>And for their solvent setting earth's own diapason,
<BR>Of winds and woods and mighty ocean waves,
<BR>A new composite orchestra, binder of years and climes,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tenfold renewer,
<BR>As of the far-back days the poets tell, the Paradiso,
<BR>The straying thence, the separation long, but now the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wandering done,
<BR>The journey done, the journeyman come home,
<BR>And man and art with Nature fused again.

<P>&nbsp;Tutti! for earth and heaven;
<BR>(The Almighty leader now for once has signal'd with his
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wand.)

<P>&nbsp;The manly strophe of the husbands of the world,
<BR>And all the wives responding.

<P>&nbsp;The tongues of violins,
<BR>(I think O tongues ye tell this heart, that cannot tell itself,
<BR>This brooding yearning heart, that cannot tell itself.)

Ah from a little child,
<BR>Thou knowest soul how to me all sounds became music,
<BR>My mother's voice in lullaby or hymn,
<BR>(The voice, O tender voices, memory's loving voices,
<BR>Last miracle of all, O dearest mother's, sister's, voices;)
<BR>The rain, the growing corn, the breeze among the long-
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; leav'd corn,
<BR>The measur'd sea-surf beating on the sand,
<BR>The twittering bird, the hawk's sharp scream,
<BR>The wild-fowl's notes at night as flying low migrating north
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or south,
<BR>The psalm in the country church or mid the clustering trees,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the open air camp-meeting,
<BR>The fiddler in the tavern, the glee, the long-strung sailor-
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; song,
<BR>The lowing cattle, bleating sheep, the crowing cock at dawn.

<P>&nbsp;All songs of current lands come sounding round me,
<BR>The German airs of friendship, wine and love,
<BR>Irish ballads, merry jigs and dances, English warbles,
<BR>Chansons of France, Scotch tunes, and o'er the rest,
<BR>Italia's peerless compositions.

<P>&nbsp;Across the stage with pallor on her face, yet lurid passion,
<BR>Stalks Norma brandishing the dagger in her hand.

<P>&nbsp;I see poor crazed Lucia's eyes' unnatural gleam,
<BR>Her hair down her back falls loose and dishevel'd.

<P>&nbsp;I see where Ernani walking the bridal garden,
<BR>Amid the scent of night-roses, radiant, holding his bride by
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the hand,
<BR>Hears the infernal call, the death-pledge of the horn.

<P>&nbsp;To crossing swords and gray hairs bared to heaven,
<BR>The clear electric base and baritone of the world,
<BR>The trombone duo, Libertad forever!

<P>&nbsp;From Spanish chestnut trees' dense shade,
<BR>By old and heavy convent walls a wailing song,
<BR>Song of lost love, the torch of youth and life quench'd in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; despair,
<BR>Song of the dying swan, Fernando's heart is breaking.

<P>&nbsp;Awaking from her woes at last retriev'd Amina sings,
<BR>Copious as stars and glad as morning light the torrents of her
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; joy.

<P>&nbsp;(The teeming lady comes,
<BR>The lustrous orb, Venus contralto, the blooming mother,
<BR>Sister of loftiest gods, Alboni's self I hear.)

I hear those odes, symphonies, operas,
<BR>I hear in the <I>William Tell</I> the music of an arous'd and angry
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; people,
<BR>I hear Meyerbeer's <I>Huguenots</I>, the <I>Prophet</I>, or <I>Robert</I>,
<BR>Gounod's <I>Faust</I>, or Mozart's <I>Don Juan</I>.

<P>&nbsp;I hear the dance-music of all nations,
<BR>The waltz, some delicious measure, lapsing, bathing me in bliss,
<BR>The bolero to tinkling guitars and clattering castanets.

<P>&nbsp;I see religious dances old and new,
<BR>I hear the sound of the Hebrew lyre,
<BR>I see the crusaders marching bearing the cross on high, to the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; martial clang of cymbals,
<BR>I hear dervishes monotonously chanting, interspers'd with
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; frantic shouts, as they spin around turning always
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; towards Mecca,

<P>&nbsp;I see the rapt religious dances of the Persians and the Arabs,
<BR>Again, at Eleusis, home of Ceres, I see the modern Greeks
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dancing,
<BR>I hear them clapping their hands as they bend their bodies,
<BR>I hear the metrical shuffling of their feet.
<BR>I see again the wild old Corybantian dance, the performers
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wounding each other,
<BR>I see the Roman youth to the shrill sound of flageolets throwing
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and catching their weapons,
<BR>As they fall on their knees and rise again.
<BR>I hear from the Mussulman mosque the muezzin calling,
<BR>I see the worshippers within, nor form nor sermon, argument
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor word,
<BR>But silent, strange, devout, rais'd glowing heads, ecstatic
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; faces.
<BR>I hear the Egyptian harp of many strings,
<BR>The primitive chants of the Nile boatmen,
<BR>The sacred imperial hymns of China,
<BR>To the delicate sounds of the king, (the stricken wood and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stone,)
<BR>Or to Hindu flutes and the fretting twang of the vina,
<BR>A band of bayaderes.

Now Asia, Africa leave me, Europe seizing inflates me,
<BR>To organs huge and bands I hear as from vast concourses of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; voices,
<BR>Luther's strong hymn <I>Eine feste Burg ist unser Gott</I>,
<BR>Rossini's <I>Stabat Mater dolorosa</I>,
<BR>Or floating in some high cathedral dim with gorgeous color'd
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; windows,
<BR>The passionate <I>Agnus Dei</I> or <I>Gloria in Excelsis</I>.
<BR>Composers! mighty maestros!
<BR>And you, sweet singers of old lands, soprani, tenori, bassi!
<BR>To you a new bard caroling in the West,
<BR>Obeisant sends his love.

<P>&nbsp;(Such led to thee O soul,
<BR>All senses, shows and objects, lead to thee,
<BR>But now it seems to me sound leads o'er all the rest.)
<BR>I hear the annual singing of the children in St. Paul's cathedral,
<BR>Or, under the high roof of some colossal hall, the symphonies,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oratorios of Beethoven, Handel, or Haydn,
<BR>The <I>Creation</I> in billows of godhood laves me.
<BR>Give me to hold all sounds, (I madly struggling cry,)
<BR>Fill me with all the voices of the universe,
<BR>Endow me with their throbbings, Nature's also,
<BR>The tempests, waters, winds, operas and chants, marches and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dances,
<BR>Utter, pour in, for I would take them all!

<P>&nbsp;

Then I woke softly,
<BR>And pausing, questioning awhile the music of my dream,
<BR>And questioning all those reminiscences, the tempest in its
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fury,
<BR>And all the songs of sopranos and tenors,
<BR>And those rapt oriental dances of religious fervor,
<BR>And the sweet varied instruments, and the diapason of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; organs,
<BR>And all the artless plaints of love and grief and death,
<BR>I said to my silent curious soul out of the bed of the slumber-
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chamber,
<BR>Come, for I have found the clew I sought so long,
<BR>Let us go forth refresh'd amid the day,
<BR>Cheerfully tallying life, walking the world, the real,
<BR>Nourish'd henceforth by our celestial dream.
<BR>And I said, moreover,
<BR>Haply what thou hast heard O soul was not the sound of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; winds,
<BR>Nor dream of raging storm, nor sea-hawk's flapping wings
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor harsh scream,
<BR>Nor vocalism of sun-bright Italy,

<P>&nbsp;Nor German organ majestic, nor vast concourse of voices,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor layers of harmonies,
<BR>Nor strophes of husbands and wives, nor sound of marching
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; soldiers,
<BR>Nor flutes, nor harps, nor the bugle-calls of camps,
<BR>But to a new rhythmus fitted for thee,
<BR>Poems bridging the way from Life to Death, vaguely wafted
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in night air, uncaught, unwritten,
<BR>Which let us go forth in the bold day and write.
