<P>F<FONT SIZE=-1>LOOD-TIDE</FONT> below me! I see you face to face!
<BR>Clouds of the west&amp;emdash;sun there half an hour high
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;emdash;I see you also face to face.

<P>&nbsp;Crowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how curious you are to me!
<BR>On the ferry-boats the hundreds and hundreds that cross,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; returning home, are more curious to me than
you suppose,
<BR>And you that shall cross from shore to shore years hence are
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more to me, and more in my meditations, than
you
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; might suppose.

<P>The impalpable sustenance of me from all things at all hours
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the day,
<BR>The simple, compact, well-join'd scheme, myself disinte-grated,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; every one disintegrated yet part of the scheme,
<BR>The similitudes of the past and those of the future,
<BR>The glories strung like beads on my smallest sights and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hearings, on the walk in the street and the
passage over
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the river,
<BR>The current rushing so swiftly and swimming with me far away,
<BR>The others that are to follow me, the ties between me and them,
<BR>The certainty of others, the life, love, sight, hearing of others.

<P>&nbsp;Others will enter the gates of the ferry and cross from shore
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to shore,
<BR>Others will watch the run of the flood-tide,
<BR>Others will see the shipping of Manhattan north and west,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the heights of Brooklyn to the south and
east,
<BR>Others will see the islands large and small;

<P>&nbsp;Fifty years hence, others will see them as they cross, the sun
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; half an hour high,
<BR>A hundred years hence, or ever so many hundred years hence,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; others will see them,
<BR>Will enjoy the sunset, the pouring-in of the flood-tide, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; falling-back to the sea of the ebb-tide.

<P>It avails not, time nor place&amp;emdash;distance avails not,
<BR>I am with you, you men and women of a generation, or ever
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so many generations hence,
<BR>Just as you feel when you look on the river and sky, so I felt,
<BR>Just as any of you is one of a living crowd, I was one of a crowd,
<BR>Just as you are refresh'd by the gladness of the river and the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bright flow, I was refresh'd,
<BR>Just as you stand and lean on the rail, yet hurry with the swift
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; current, I stood yet was hurried,
<BR>Just as you look on the numberless masts of ships and the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thick-stemm'd pipes of steamboats, I look'd.

<P>&nbsp;I too many and many a time cross'd the river of old,
<BR>Watched the Twelfth-month sea-gulls, saw them high in the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; air floating with motionless wings, oscillating
their bodies,
<BR>Saw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of their bodies and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; left the rest in strong shadow,
<BR>Saw the slow-wheeling circles and the gradual edging toward
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the south,
<BR>Saw the reflection of the summer sky in the water,
<BR>Had my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of beams,
<BR>Look'd at the fine centrifugal spokes of light round the shape
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of my head in the sunlit water,
<BR>Look'd on the haze on the hills southward and south-west-ward,
<BR>Look'd on the vapor as it flew in fleeces tinged with violet,
<BR>Look'd toward the lower bay to notice the vessels arriving,
<BR>Saw their approach, saw aboard those that were near me,
<BR>Saw the white sails of schooners and sloops, saw the ships
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at anchor,

<P>&nbsp;The sailors at work in the rigging or out astride the spars,
<BR>The round masts, the swinging motion of the hulls, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; slender serpentine pennants,
<BR>The large and small steamers in motion, the pilots in their
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pilot-houses,
<BR>The white wake left by the passage, the quick tremulous whirl
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the wheels,
<BR>The flags of all nations, the falling of them at sunset,
<BR>The scallop-edged waves in the twilight, the ladled cups, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; frolicsome crests and glistening,
<BR>The stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer, the gray walls
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the granite storehouses by the docks,
<BR>On the river the shadowy group, the big steam-tug closely
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flank'd on each side by the barges, the hay-boat,
the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; belated lighter,
<BR>On the neighboring shore the fires from the foundry
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chimneys burning high and glaringly into the
night,
<BR>Casting their flicker of black contrasted with wild red and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yellow light over the tops of houses, and
down into the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clefts of streets.

<P>These and all else were to me the same as they are to you,
<BR>I loved well those cities, loved well the stately and rapid river,
<BR>The men and women I saw were all near to me,
<BR>Others the same&amp;emdash;others who look back on me because I
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; look'd forward to them,
<BR>(The time will come, though I stop here to-day, and to-night.)

<P>What is it then between us?
<BR>What is the count of the scores or hundreds of years between us?

<P>&nbsp;Whatever it is, it avails not&amp;emdash;distance avails not,
and place
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; avails not,
<BR>I too lived, Brooklyn of ample hills was mine,
<BR>I too walk'd the streets of Manhattan island, and bathed in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the waters around it,
<BR>I too felt the curious abrupt questionings stir within me.

<P>&nbsp;In the day among crowds of people sometimes they came upon me,
<BR>In my walks home late at night or as I lay in my bed they
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; came upon me,
<BR>I too had been struck from the float forever held in solution,
<BR>I too had receiv'd identity by my body,
<BR>That I was I knew was of my body, and what I should be I
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; knew I should be of my body.

<P>&nbsp;
<CENTER>6</CENTER>


<P>It is not upon you alone the dark patches fall,
<BR>The dark threw its patches down upon me also,
<BR>The best I had done seem'd to me blank and suspicious,
<BR>My great thoughts as I supposed them, were they not in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reality meagre?
<BR>Nor is it you alone who know what it is to be evil,
<BR>I am he who knew what it was to be evil,
<BR>I too knitted the old knot of contrariety,
<BR>Blabb'd, blush'd, resented, lied, stole, grudg'd,
<BR>Had guile, anger, lust, hot wishes I dared not speak,
<BR>Was wayward, vain, greedy, shallow, sly, cowardly, malignant,
<BR>The wolf, the snake, the hog, not wanting in me,
<BR>The cheating look, the frivolous word, the adulterous wish,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not wanting,
<BR>Refusals, hates, postponements, meanness, laziness, none of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; these wanting,
<BR>Was one with the rest, the days and haps of the rest,
<BR>Was call'd by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; men as they saw me approaching or passing,
<BR>Felt their arms on my neck as I stood, or the negligent
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; leaning of their flesh against me as I sat,
<BR>Saw many I loved in the street or ferry-boat or public
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; assembly, yet never told them a word,
<BR>Lived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gnawing, sleeping,
<BR>Play'd the part that still looks back on the actor or actress,
<BR>The same old role, the role that is what we make it, as great
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as we like,
<BR>Or as small as we like, or both great and small.

<P>Closer yet I approach you,
<BR>What thought you have of me now, I had as much of you&amp;emdash;I
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; laid in my stores in advance,
<BR>I consider'd long and seriously of you before you were born.

<P>&nbsp;Who was to know what should come home to me?
<BR>Who knows but I am enjoying this?
<BR>Who knows, for all the distance, but I am as good as looking
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at you now, for all you cannot see me?

<P>&nbsp;
<CENTER>8</CENTER>


<P>Ah, what can ever be more stately and admirable to me than
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mast-hemm'd Manhattan?
<BR>River and sunset and scallop-edg'd waves of flood-tide?
<BR>The sea-gulls oscillating their bodies, the hay-boat in the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; twilight, and the belated lighter?

<P>&nbsp;What gods can exceed these that clasp me by the hand, and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with voices I love call me promptly and loudly
by my
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nighest name as I approach?

<P>&nbsp;What is more subtle than this which ties me to the woman or
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; man that looks in my face?
<BR>Which fuses me into you now, and pours my meaning into you?

<P>&nbsp;We understand then do we not?
<BR>What I promis'd without mentioning it, have you not accepted?
<BR>What the study could not teach&amp;emdash;what the preaching could
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not accomplish is accomplish'd, is it not?

<P>Flow on, river! flow with the flood-tide, and ebb with the ebb-tide!
<BR>Frolic on, created and scallop-edg'd waves!
<BR>Gorgeous clouds of the sunset! drench with your splendor me, or
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the men and women generations after me!

<P>&nbsp;Cross from shore to shore, countless crowds of passengers!
<BR>Stand up, tall masts of Mannahatta! stand up, beautiful hills
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of Brooklyn!
<BR>Throb, baffled and curious brain! throw out questions and answers!
<BR>Suspend here and everywhere, eternal float of solution!
<BR>Gaze, loving and thirsting eyes, in the house or street or public
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; assembly!
<BR>Sound out, voices of young men! loudly and musically call
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me by my nighest name!
<BR>Live, old life! play the part that looks back on the actor or actress!
<BR>Play the old role, the role that is great or small according as
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one makes it!
<BR>Consider, you who peruse me, whether I may not in unknown
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ways be looking upon you;
<BR>Be firm, rail over the river, to support those who lean idly,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yet haste with the hasting current;
<BR>Fly on, sea-birds! fly sideways, or wheel in large circles high
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the air;
<BR>Receive the summer sky, you water, and faithfully hold it till
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all downcast eyes have time to take it from
you!
<BR>Diverge, fine spokes of light, from the shape of my head, or
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any one's head, in the sunlit water!
<BR>Come on, ships from the lower bay! pass up or down,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; white-sail'd schooners, sloops, lighters!
<BR>Flaunt away, flags of all nations! be duly lower'd at sunset!
<BR>Burn high your fires, foundry chimneys! cast black shadows
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at nightfall! cast red and yellow light over
the tops
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the houses!
<BR>Appearances, now or henceforth, indicate what you are,
<BR>You necessary film, continue to envelop the soul,
<BR>About my body for me, and your body for you, be hung our
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; divinest aromas,
<BR>Thrive, cities&amp;emdash;bring your freight, bring your shows,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ample and sufficient rivers,
<BR>Expand, being than which none else is perhaps more spiritual,
<BR>Keep your places, objects than which none else is more lasting.

<P>&nbsp;You have waited, you always wait, you dumb, beautiful ministers,
<BR>We receive you with free sense at last, and are insatiate
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hence-forward,
<BR>Not you any more shall be able to foil us, or withhold
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yourselves from us,
<BR>We use you, and do not cast you aside&amp;emdash;we plant you
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; permanently within us,
<BR>We fathom you not&amp;emdash;we love you&amp;emdash;there is
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; perfection in you also,
<BR>You furnish your parts toward eternity,
<BR>Great or small, you furnish your parts toward the soul.
