T<FONT SIZE=-1>hou</FONT> Mother with thy equal brood,
<BR>Thou varied chain of different States, yet one identity only,
<BR>A special song before I go I'd sing o'er all the rest,
<BR>For thee, the future.

<P>&nbsp;I'd sow a seed for thee of endless Nationality,
<BR>I'd fashion thy ensemble including body and soul,
<BR>I'd show away ahead thy real Union, and how it may be
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; accomplish'd.

<P>&nbsp;The paths to the house I seek to make,
<BR>But leave to those to come the house itself.

<P>&nbsp;Belief I sing, and preparation;
<BR>As Life and Nature are not great with reference to the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; present only,
<BR>But greater still from what is yet to come,
<BR>Out of that formula for thee I sing.

As a strong bird on pinions free,
<BR>Joyous, the amplest spaces heavenward cleaving,
<BR>Such be the thought I'd think of thee America,
<BR>Such be the recitative I'd bring for thee.

<P>&nbsp;The conceits of the poets of other lands I'd bring thee not,
<BR>Nor the compliments that have served their turn so long,
<BR>Nor rhyme, nor the classics, nor perfume of foreign court or
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; indoor library;
<BR>But an odor I'd bring as from forests of pine in Maine, or
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; breath of an Illinois prairie,
<BR>With open airs of Virginia or Georgia or Tennessee, or from
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Texas uplands, or Florida's glades,
<BR>Or the Saguenay's black stream, or the wide blue spread of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Huron,
<BR>With presentment of Yellowstone's scenes, or Yosemite,
<BR>And murmuring under, pervading all, I'd bring the rustling
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sea-sound,
<BR>That endlessly sounds from the two Great Seas of the world.

<P>&nbsp;And for thy subtler sense subtler refrains dread Mother,
<BR>Preludes of intellect tallying these and thee, mind-formulas
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fitted for thee, real and sane and large as these
and thee,
<BR>Thou! mounting higher, diving deeper than we knew, thou
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; transcendental Union!
<BR>By thee fact to be justified, blended with thought,
<BR>Thought of man justified, blended with God,
<BR>Through thy idea, lo, the immortal reality!
<BR>Through thy reality, lo, the immortal ideal!

Brain of the New World, what a task is thine,
<BR>To formulate the Modern&amp;emdash;out of the peerless grandeur of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the modern,
<BR>Out of thyself, comprising science, to recast poems, churches,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; art,
<BR>(Recast, maybe discard them, end them&amp;emdash;maybe their work
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is done, who knows?)
<BR>By vision, hand, conception, on the background of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mighty past, the dead,
<BR>To limn with absolute faith the mighty living present.

<P>&nbsp;And yet thou living present brain, heir of the dead, the Old
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; World brain,
<BR>Thou that lay folded like an unborn babe within its fold so
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long,
<BR>Thou carefully prepared by it so long&amp;emdash;haply thou but
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unfoldest it, only maturest it,

<P>&nbsp;It to eventuate in thee&amp;emdash;the essence of the by-gone
time
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contain'd in thee,
<BR>Its poems, churches, arts, unwitting to themselves, destined
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with reference to thee;
<BR>Thou but the apples, long, long, long a-growing,
<BR>The fruit of all the Old ripening to-day in thee.

Sail, sail thy best, ship of Democracy,
<BR>Of value is thy freight, 'tis not the Present only,
<BR>The Past is also stored in thee,
<BR>Thou holdest not the venture of thyself alone, not of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Western continent alone,
<BR>Earth's <I>r&egrave;esum&egrave;e</I> entire floats on thy keel O ship,
is steadied by
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thy spars,
<BR>With thee Time voyages in trust, the antecedent nations sink
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or swim with thee,
<BR>With all their ancient struggles, martyrs, heroes, epics, wars,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thou bear'st the other continents,
<BR>Theirs, theirs as much as thine, the destination-port
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; triumphant;
<BR>Steer then with good strong hand and wary eye O helmsman,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thou carriest great companions,
<BR>Venerable priestly Asia sails this day with thee,
<BR>And royal feudal Europe sails with thee.

Beautiful world of new superber birth that rises to my eyes,
<BR>Like a limitless golden cloud filling the western sky,
<BR>Emblem of general maternity lifted above all,
<BR>Sacred shape of the bearer of daughters and sons,

<BR>I feel thy ominous greatness evil as well as good,
<BR>I watch thee advancing, absorbing the present, transcending
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the past,
<BR>I see thy light lighting, and thy shadow shadowing, as if the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; entire globe,
<BR>But I do not undertake to define thee, hardly to comprehend
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thee,
<BR>I but thee name, thee prophesy, as now,

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hilarity,
<BR>Scattering for good the cloud that hung so long, that weigh'd

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; man;

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mother!)
<BR>Thee in an education grown of thee, in teachers, studies,

Two boats with nets lying off the sea-beach, quite still,
<BR>Ten fishermen waiting&amp;emdash;they discover a thick school of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mossbonkers&amp;emdash;they drop the join'd seine-ends
in the water,
<BR>The boats separate and row off, each on its rounding course
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the beach, enclosing the mossbonkers,
<BR>The net is drawn in by a windlass by those who stop ashore,
<BR>Some of the fishermen lounge in their boats, others stand
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ankle-deep in the water, pois'd on strong legs,
<BR>The boats partly drawn up, the water slapping against them,
<BR>Strew'd on the sand in heaps and windrows, well out from
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the water, the green-back'd spotted mossbonkers.
