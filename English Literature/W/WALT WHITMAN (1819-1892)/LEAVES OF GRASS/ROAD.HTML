<I>Song of the Open Road</I></H1></CENTER>

<CENTER>1</CENTER>


<P>A<FONT SIZE=-1>FOOT</FONT> and light-hearted I take to the open road,
<BR>Healthy, free, the world before me,
<BR>The long brown path before me leading wherever I choose.

<P>&nbsp;Henceforth I ask not good-fortune, I myself am good-fortune,
<BR>Henceforth I whimper no more, postpone no more, need
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing,
<BR>Done with indoor complaints, libraries, querulous criticisms,
<BR>Strong and content I travel the open road.

<P>&nbsp;The earth, that is sufficient,
<BR>I do not want the constellations any nearer,
<BR>I know they are very well where they are,
<BR>I know they suffice for those who belong to them.

<P>&nbsp;(Still here I carry my old delicious burdens,
<BR>I carry them, men and women, I carry them with me
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wherever I go,

<P>&nbsp;I swear it is impossible for me to get rid of them,
<BR>I am fill'd with them; and I will fill them in return.)

<P>&nbsp;
<CENTER>2</CENTER>


<P>You road I enter upon and look around, I believe you are
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not all that is here,
<BR>I believe that much unseen is also here.

<P>&nbsp;Here the profound lesson of reception, nor preference nor
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; denial,
<BR>The black with his woolly head, the felon, the diseas'd, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; illiterate person, are not denied;
<BR>The birth, the hasting after the physician, the beggar's tramp,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the drunkard's stagger, the laughing party
of mechanics,
<BR>The escaped youth, the rich person's carriage, the fop, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eloping couple,
<BR>The early market-man, the hearse, the moving of furniture
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; into the town, the return back from the town,
<BR>They pass, I also pass, any thing passes, none can be
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interdicted,
<BR>None but are accepted, none but shall be dear to me.

<P>&nbsp;
<CENTER>3</CENTER>


<P>You air that serves me with breath to speak!
<BR>You objects that call from diffusion my meanings and give
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them shape!
<BR>You light that wraps me and all things in delicate equable
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; showers!
<BR>You paths worn in the irregular hollows by the roadsides!
<BR>I believe you are latent with unseen existences, you are so
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dear to me.

<P>&nbsp;You flagg'd walks of the cities! you strong curbs at the edges!
<BR>You ferries! you planks and posts of wharves! you timberlined
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sides! you distant ships!
<BR>You rows of houses! you window-pierc'd fa&ccedil;ades! you roofs!
<BR>You porches and entrances! you copings and iron guards!
<BR>You windows whose transparent shells might expose so much!

<P>&nbsp;You doors and ascending steps! you arches!
<BR>You gray stones of interminable pavements! you trodden
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; crossings!
<BR>From all that has touch'd you I believe you have imparted to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yourselves, and now would impart the same
secretly to me,
<BR>From the living and the dead you have peopled your impassive
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; surfaces, and the spirits thereof would be
evident and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; amicable with me.

<P>&nbsp;
<CENTER>4</CENTER>


<P>The earth expanding right hand and left hand,
<BR>The picture alive, every part in its best light,
<BR>The music falling in where it is wanted, and stopping where
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it is not wanted,
<BR>The cheerful voice of the public road, the gay fresh sentiment
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the road.

<P>&nbsp;O highway I travel, do you say to me <I>Do not leave me?</I>
<BR>Do you say <I>Venture not&amp;emdash;if you leave me you are lost?</I>
<BR>Do you say <I>I am already prepared, I am well-beaten and</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; undenied, adhere to me?</I>

<P>&nbsp;O public road, I say back I am not afraid to leave you, yet I
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; love you,
<BR>You express me better than I can express myself,
<BR>You shall be more to me than my poem.

<P>&nbsp;I think heroic deeds were all conceiv'd in the open air, and all
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; free poems also,
<BR>I think I could stop here myself and do miracles,
<BR>I think whatever I shall meet on the road I shall like, and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whoever beholds me shall like me,
<BR>I think whoever I see must be happy.

<P>&nbsp;
<CENTER>5</CENTER>


<P>From this hour I ordain myself loos'd of limits and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; imaginary lines,
<BR>Going where I list, my own master total and absolute,
<BR>Listening to others, considering well what they say,

<P>&nbsp;Pausing, searching, receiving, contemplating,
<BR>Gently, but with undeniable will, divesting myself of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; holds that would hold me.

<P>&nbsp;I inhale great draughts of space,
<BR>The east and the west are mine, and the north and the south
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are mine.

<P>&nbsp;I am larger, better than I thought,
<BR>I did not know I held so much goodness.

<P>&nbsp;All seems beautiful to me,
<BR>I can repeat over to men and women You have done such
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; good to me I would do the same to you,
<BR>I will recruit for myself and you as I go,
<BR>I will scatter myself among men and women as I go,
<BR>I will toss a new gladness and roughness among them,
<BR>Whoever denies me it shall not trouble me,
<BR>Whoever accepts me he or she shall be blessed and shall bless
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me.

<P>&nbsp;
<CENTER>6</CENTER>


<P>Now if a thousand perfect men were to appear it would not
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; amaze me,
<BR>Now if a thousand beautiful forms of women appear'd it
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; would not astonish me.

<P>&nbsp;Now I see the secret of the making of the best persons,
<BR>It is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; earth.

<P>&nbsp;Here a great personal deed has room,
<BR>(Such a deed seizes upon the hearts of the whole race of men,
<BR>Its effusion of strength and will overwhelms law and mocks
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all authority and all argument against it.)

<P>&nbsp;Here is the test of wisdom,
<BR>Wisdom is not finally tested in schools,
<BR>Wisdom cannot be pass'd from one having it to another not
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; having it,

<P>&nbsp;Wisdom is of the soul, is not susceptible of proof, is its own
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; proof,
<BR>Applies to all stages and objects and qualities and is content,
<BR>Is the certainty of the reality and immortality of things, and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the excellence of things;
<BR>Something there is in the float of the sight of things that
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; provokes it out of the soul.

<P>&nbsp;Now I re-examine philosophies and religions,
<BR>They may prove well in lecture-rooms, yet not prove at all
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under the spacious clouds and along the landscape
and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flowing currents.

<P>&nbsp;Here is realization,
<BR>Here is a man tallied&amp;emdash;he realizes here what he has in him,
<BR>The past, the future, majesty, love&amp;emdash;if they are vacant of
you,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you are vacant of them.

<P>&nbsp;Only the kernel of every object nourishes;
<BR>Where is he who tears off the husks for you and me?
<BR>Where is he that undoes stratagems and envelopes for you
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and me?

<P>&nbsp;Here is adhesiveness, it is not previously fashion'd, it is
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; apropos;
<BR>Do you know what it is as you pass to be loved by strangers?
<BR>Do you know the talk of those turning eye-balls?

<P>&nbsp;
<CENTER>7</CENTER>


<P>Here is the efflux of the soul,
<BR>The efflux of the soul comes from within through embower'd
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gates, ever provoking questions,
<BR>These yearnings why are they? these thoughts in the darkness
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; why are they?
<BR>Why are there men and women that while they are nigh me
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the sunlight expands my blood?
<BR>Why when they leave me do my pennants of joy sink flat and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lank?
<BR>Why are there trees I never walk under but large and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; melodious thoughts descend upon me?

<P>&nbsp;(I think they hang there winter and summer on those trees
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and always drop fruit as I pass;)
<BR>What is it I interchange so suddenly with strangers?
<BR>What with some driver as I ride on the seat by his side?
<BR>What with some fisherman drawing his seine by the shore as
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I walk by and pause?
<BR>What gives me to be free to a woman's and man's good-will?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what gives them to be free to mine?

<P>&nbsp;
<CENTER>8</CENTER>


<P>The efflux of the soul is happiness, here is happiness,
<BR>I think it pervades the open air, waiting at all times,
<BR>Now it flows unto us, we are rightly charged.

<P>&nbsp;Here rises the fluid and attaching character,
<BR>The fluid and attaching character is the freshness and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sweetness of man and woman,
<BR>(The herbs of the morning sprout no fresher and sweeter
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; every day out of the roots of themselves,
than it sprouts
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fresh and sweet continually out of itself.)
<BR>Toward the fluid and attaching character exudes the sweat of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the love of young and old,
<BR>From it falls distill'd the charm that mocks beauty and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; attainments,
<BR>Toward it heaves the shuddering longing ache of contact.

<P>Allons! whoever you are come travel with me!
<BR>Travelling with me you find what never tires.

<P>&nbsp;The earth never tires,
<BR>The earth is rude, silent, incomprehensible at first, Nature is
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rude and incomprehensible at first,
<BR>Be not discouraged, keep on, there are divine things well
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; envelop'd,
<BR>I swear to you there are divine things more beautiful than
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; words can tell.

<P>&nbsp;Allons! we must not stop here,
<BR>However sweet these laid-up stores, however convenient this
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dwelling we cannot remain here,
<BR>However shelter'd this port and however calm these waters
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we must not anchor here,
<BR>However welcome the hospitality that surrounds us we are
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; permitted to receive it but a little while.

<P>&nbsp;
<CENTER>10</CENTER>


<P>Allons! the inducements shall be greater,
<BR>We will sail pathless and wild seas,
<BR>We will go where winds blow, waves dash, and the Yankee
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clipper speeds by under full sail.

<P>&nbsp;Allons! with power, liberty, the earth, the elements,
<BR>Health, defiance, gayety, self-esteem, curiosity;
<BR>Allons! from all formules!
<BR>From your formules, O bat-eyed and materialistic priests.

<P>&nbsp;The stale cadaver blocks up the passage&amp;emdash;the burial
waits no
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; longer.

<P>&nbsp;Allons! yet take warning!
<BR>He traveling with me needs the best blood, thews, endurance,
<BR>None may come to the trial till he or she bring courage and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; health,
<BR>Come not here if you have already spent the best of yourself,
<BR>Only those may come who come in sweet and determin'd bodies,
<BR>No diseas'd person, no rum-drinker or venereal taint is
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; permitted here.

<P>&nbsp;(I and mine do not convince by arguments, similes, rhymes,
<BR>We convince by our presence.)

<P>&nbsp;
<CENTER>11</CENTER>


<P>Listen! I will be honest with you,
<BR>I do not offer the old smooth prizes, but offer rough new prizes,
<BR>These are the days that must happen to you:

<P>&nbsp;You shall not heap up what is call'd riches,
<BR>You shall scatter with lavish hand all that you earn or achieve,
<BR>You but arrive at the city to which you were destin'd, you
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hardly settle yourself to satisfaction before
you are
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; call'd by an irresistible call to depart,
<BR>You shall be treated to the ironical smiles and mockings of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those who remain behind you,
<BR>What beckonings of love you receive you shall only answer
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with passionate kisses of parting,
<BR>You shall not allow the hold of those who spread their
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reach'd hands toward you.

<P>Allons! after the great Companions, and to belong to them!
<BR>They too are on the road&amp;emdash;they are the swift and majestic
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; men&amp;emdash;they are the greatest women,
<BR>Enjoyers of calms of seas and storms of seas,
<BR>Sailors of many a ship, walkers of many a mile of land,
<BR>Habitu&egrave;s of many distant countries, habitu&egrave;s of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; far-distant dwellings,
<BR>Trusters of men and women, observers of cities, solitary
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; toilers,
<BR>Pausers and contemplators of tufts, blossoms, shells of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shore,
<BR>Dancers at wedding-dances, kissers of brides, tender helpers of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; children, bearers of children,
<BR>Soldiers of revolts, standers by gaping graves, lowerers-down
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of coffins,
<BR>Journeyers over consecutive seasons, over the years, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; curious years each emerging from that which
proceded it,
<BR>Journeyers as with companions, namely their own diverse
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; phases,
<BR>Forth-steppers from the latent unrealized baby-days,
<BR>Journeyers gayly with their own youth, journeyers with their
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bearded and well-grain'd manhood,
<BR>Journeyers with their womanhood, ample, unsurpass'd,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; content,
<BR>Journeyers with their own sublime old age of manhood or
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; womanhood,

<P>&nbsp;Old age, calm, expanded, broad with the haughty breadth of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the universe,
<BR>Old age, flowing free with the delicious near-by freedom of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; death.

<P>&nbsp;
<CENTER>13</CENTER>


<P>Allons! to that which is endless as it was beginningless,
<BR>To undergo much, tramps of days, rests of nights,
<BR>To merge all in the travel they tend to, and the days and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nights they tend to,
<BR>Again to merge them in the start of superior journeys,
<BR>To see nothing anywhere but what you may reach it and pass
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it,
<BR>To conceive no time, however distant, but what you may
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reach it and pass it,
<BR>To look up or down no road but it stretches and waits for
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you, however long but it stretches and waits
for you,
<BR>To see no being, not God's or any, but you also go thither,
<BR>To see no possession but you may possess it, enjoying all
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without labor or purchase, abstracting the
feast yet not
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; abstracting one particle of it,
<BR>To take the best of the farmer's farm and the rich man's
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; elegant villa, and the chaste blessings of
the well-married
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; couple, and the fruits of orchards and flowers
of gardens,
<BR>To take to your use out of the compact cities as you pass
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; through,
<BR>To carry buildings and streets with you afterward wherever you go,
<BR>To gather the minds of men out of their brains as you
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; encounter them, to gather the love out of
their hearts,
<BR>To take your lovers on the road with you, for all that you
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; leave them behind you,
<BR>To know the universe itself as a road, as many roads, as roads
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for traveling souls.

<P>&nbsp;All parts away for the progress of souls,
<BR>All religion, all solid things, arts, governments&amp;emdash;all that
was
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or is apparent upon this globe or any globe,
falls into
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; niches and corners before the procession of
souls along
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the grand roads of the universe.

<P>&nbsp;Of the progress of the souls of men and women along the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grand roads of the universe, all other progress
is the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; needed emblem and sustenance.

<P>&nbsp;Forever alive, forever forward,
<BR>Stately, solemn, sad, withdrawn, baffled, mad, turbulent,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; feeble, dissatisfied,
<BR>Desperate, proud, fond, sick, accepted by men, rejected by
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; men,
<BR>They go! they go! I know that they go, but I know not where
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they go,
<BR>But I know that they go toward the best&amp;emdash;toward
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; something great.

<P>&nbsp;Whoever you are, come forth! or man or woman come forth!
<BR>You must not stay sleeping and dallying there in the house,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; though you built it, or though it has been
built for you.

<P>&nbsp;Out of the dark confinement! out from behind the screen!
<BR>It is useless to protest, I know all and expose it.

<P>&nbsp;Behold through you as bad as the rest,
<BR>Through the laughter, dancing, dining, supping, of people,
<BR>Inside of dresses and ornaments, inside of those wash'd and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trimm'd faces,
<BR>Behold a secret silent loathing and despair.

<P>&nbsp;No husband, no wife, no friend, trusted to hear the confession,
<BR>Another self, a duplicate of every one, skulking and hiding it goes,
<BR>Formless and wordless through the streets of the cities, polite
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and bland in the parlors,
<BR>In the cars of railroads, in steamboats, in the public assembly,
<BR>Home to the houses of men and women, at the table, in the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bedroom, everywhere,
<BR>Smartly attired, countenance smiling, form upright, death
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under the breast-bones, hell under the skull-bones,
<BR>Under the broadcloth and gloves, under the ribbons and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; artificial flowers,

<P>&nbsp;Keeping fair with the customs, speaking not a syllable of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; itself,
<BR>Speaking of any thing else but never of itself.

<P>Allons! through struggles and wars!
<BR>The goal that was named cannot be countermanded.

<P>&nbsp;Have the past struggles succeeded?
<BR>What has succeeded? yourself? your nation? Nature?
<BR>Now understand me well&amp;emdash;it is provided in the essence of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; things that from any fruition of success,
no matter what,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shall come forth something to make a greater
struggle
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; necessary.

<P>&nbsp;My call is the call of battle, I nourish active rebellion,
<BR>He going with me must go well arm'd,
<BR>He going with me goes often with spare diet, poverty, angry
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enemies, desertions.

<BR>Let the paper remain on the desk unwritten, and the book on

<P>&nbsp;Let the tools remain in the workshop! let the money remain
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unearn'd!
<BR>Let the school stand! mind not the cry of the teacher!
<BR>Let the preacher preach in his pulpit! let the lawyer plead in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the court, and the judge expound the law.

<P>&nbsp;Camerado, I give you my hand!
<BR>I give you my love more precise than money,
