SCENTED HERBAGE OF MY BREAST</H2></CENTER>
S<FONT SIZE=-1>CENTED</FONT> herbage of my breast,
<BR>Leaves from you I glean, I write, to be perused best
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; afterwards,
<BR>Tomb-leaves, body-leaves growing up above me above death.

<P>&nbsp;Perennial roots, tall leaves, O the winter shall not freeze you
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; delicate leaves,
<BR>Every year shall you bloom again, out from where you retired
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you shall emerge again;
<BR>O I do not know whether many passing by will discover you
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or inhale your faint odor, but I believe a
few will;
<BR>O slender leaves! O blossoms of my blood! I permit you to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tell in your own way of the heart that is
under you,
<BR>O I do not know what you mean there underneath yourselves,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you are not happiness,
<BR>You are often more bitter than I can bear, you burn and sting
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me,
<BR>Yet you are beautiful to me you faint-tinged roots, you make
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me think of death,
<BR>Death is beautiful from you, (what indeed is finally beautiful
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; except death and love?)
<BR>O I think it is not for life I am chanting here my chant of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lovers, I think it must be for death,
<BR>For how calm, how solemn it grows to ascend to the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; atmosphere of lovers,
<BR>Death or life I am then indifferent, my soul declines to prefer,
<BR>(I am not sure but the high soul of lovers welcomes death
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; most,)
<BR>Indeed O death, I think now these leaves mean precisely the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; same as you mean,
<BR>Grow up taller sweet leaves that I may see! grow up out of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my breast!
<BR>Spring away from the conceal'd heart there!
<BR>Do not fold yourself so in your pink-tinged roots timid leaves!
<BR>Do not remain down there so ashamed, herbage of my breast!
<BR>Come I am determin'd to unbare this broad breast of mine, I
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have long enough stifled and choked;
<BR>Emblematic and capricious blades I leave you, now you serve
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me not,
<BR>I will say what I have to say by itself,
<BR>I will sound myself and comrades only, I will never again
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; utter a call only their call,
<BR>I will raise with it immortal reverberations through the States,
<BR>I will give an example to lovers to take permanent shape and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will through the States,

<P>&nbsp;Through me shall the words be said to make death
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exhilarating.
<BR>Give me your tone therefore O death, that I may accord with
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it,
<BR>Give me yourself, for I see that you belong to me now above
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all, and are folded inseparably together,
you love and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; death are,
<BR>Nor will I allow you to balk me any more with what I was
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; calling life,
<BR>For now it is convey'd to me that you are the purports
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; essential,
<BR>That you hide in these shifting forms of life, for reasons, and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that they are mainly for you,
<BR>That you beyond them come forth to remain, the real reality,
<BR>That behind the mask of materials you patiently wait, no
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; matter how long,
<BR>That you will one day perhaps take control of all,
<BR>That you will perhaps dissipate this entire show of appearance,
<BR>That may-be you are what it is all for, but it does not last so
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; very long,
<BR>But you will last very long.

W<FONT SIZE=-1>HOEVER</FONT> you are holding me now in hand,

<P>&nbsp;Who is he that would become my follower?

<P>&nbsp;The way is suspicious, the result uncertain, perhaps
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; destructive,
<BR>You would have to give up all else, I alone would expect to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be your sole and exclusive standard,

<P>&nbsp;Or else by stealth in some wood for trial,
<BR>Or back of a rock in the open air,
<BR>(For in any roof'd room of a house I emerge not, nor in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; company,
<BR>And in libraries I lie as one dumb, a gawk, or unborn, or
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dead,)

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any person for miles around approach unawares,
<BR>Or possibly with you sailing at sea, or on the beach of the sea

<BR>Here to put your lips upon mine I permit you,
<BR>With the comrade's long-dwelling kiss or the new husband's
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kiss,
<BR>For I am the new husband and I am the comrade.

<P>&nbsp;Or if you will, thrusting me beneath your clothing,
<BR>Where I may feel the throbs of your heart or rest upon your
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hip,
<BR>Carry me when you go forth over land or sea;
<BR>For thus merely touching you is enough, is best,
<BR>And thus touching you would I silently sleep and be carried
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eternally.

<P>&nbsp;But these leaves conning you con at peril,
<BR>For these leaves and me you will not understand,
<BR>They will elude you at first and still more afterward, I will
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; certainly elude you,
<BR>Even while you should think you had unquestionably caught
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me, behold!
<BR>Already you see I have escaped from you.

<P>&nbsp;For it is not for what I have put into it that I have written
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this book,
<BR>Nor is it by reading it you will acquire it,

<P>&nbsp;Nor do those know me best who admire me and vauntingly
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; praise me,
<BR>Nor will the candidates for my love (unless at most a very
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; few) prove victorious,
<BR>Nor will my poems do good only, they will do just as much
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; evil, perhaps more,
<BR>For all is useless without that which you may guess at many
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; times and not hit, that which I hinted at;
