<P>I <FONT SIZE=-1>CELEBRATE</FONT> myself, and sing myself,
<BR>And what I assume you shall assume,
<BR>For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.

<P>&nbsp;I loafe and invite my soul,
<BR>I lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of summer grass.

<P>&nbsp;My tongue, every atom of my blood, form'd from this soil,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this air,
<BR>Born here of parents born here from parents the same, and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their parents the same,
<BR>I, now thirty-seven years old in perfect health begin,
<BR>Hoping to cease not till death.

<P>&nbsp;Creeds and schools in abeyance,
<BR>Retiring back a while sufficed at what they are, but never
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; forgotten,
<BR>I harbor for good or bad, I permit to speak at every hazard,
<BR>Nature without check with original energy.

<P>Houses and rooms are full of perfumes, the shelves are
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; crowded with perfumes,
<BR>I breathe the fragrance myself and know it and like it,
<BR>The distillation would intoxicate me also, but I shall not let it.

<P>&nbsp;The atmosphere is not a perfume, it has no taste of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; distillation, it is odorless,
<BR>It is for my mouth forever, I am in love with it,
<BR>I will go to the bank by the wood and become undisguised
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and naked,
<BR>I am mad for it to be in contact with me.

<P>&nbsp;The smoke of my own breath,
<BR>Echoes, ripples, buzz'd whispers, love-root, silk-thread,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; crotch and vine,
<BR>My respiration and inspiration, the beating of my heart, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; passing of blood and air through my lungs,
<BR>The sniff of green leaves and dry leaves, and of the shore and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dark-color'd sea-rocks, and of hay in the
barn,
<BR>The sound of the belch'd words of my voice loos'd to the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eddies of the wind,
<BR>A few light kisses, a few embraces, a reaching around of arms,
<BR>The play of shine and shade on the trees as the supple boughs
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wag,
<BR>The delight alone or in the rush of the streets, or along the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fields and hill-sides,
<BR>The feeling of health, the full-noon trill, the song of me rising
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from bed and meeting the sun.

<P>&nbsp;Have you reckon'd a thousand acres much? have you reckon'd
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the earth much?
<BR>Have you practis'd so long to learn to read?
<BR>Have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems?

<P>&nbsp;Stop this day and night with me and you shall possess the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; origin of all poems,
<BR>You shall possess the good of the earth and sun, (there are
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; millions of suns left,)
<BR>You shall no longer take things at second or third hand, nor
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; look through the eyes of the dead, nor feed
on the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spectres in books,
<BR>You shall not look through my eyes either, nor take things
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from me,
<BR>You shall listen to all sides and filter them from your self.

<P>I have heard what the talkers were talking, the talk of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beginning and the end,
<BR>But I do not talk of the beginning or the end.

<P>&nbsp;There was never any more inception than there is now,
<BR>Nor any more youth or age than there is now,
<BR>And will never be any more perfection than there is now,
<BR>Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now.

<P>&nbsp;Urge and urge and urge,
<BR>Always the procreant urge of the world.
<BR>Out of the dimness opposite equals advance, always
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; substance and increase, always sex,
<BR>Always a knit of identity, always distinction, always a breed
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of life.

<P>&nbsp;To elaborate is no avail, learn'd and unlearn'd feel that it is
so.

<P>&nbsp;Sure as the most certain sure, plumb in the uprights, well
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; entretied, braced in the beams,
<BR>Stout as a horse, affectionate, haughty, electrical,
<BR>I and this mystery here we stand.

<P>&nbsp;Clear and sweet is my soul, and clear and sweet is all that is
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not my soul.

<P>&nbsp;Lack one lacks both, and the unseen is proved by the seen,
<BR>Till that becomes unseen and receives proof in its turn.

<P>&nbsp;Showing the best and dividing it from the worst age vexes age,
<BR>Knowing the perfect fitness and equanimity of things, while
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they discuss I am silent, and go bathe and
admire myself.

<P>&nbsp;Welcome is every organ and attribute of me, and of any man
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hearty and clean,
<BR>Not an inch nor a particle of an inch is vile, and none shall be
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; less familiar than the rest.

<P>&nbsp;I am satisfied &amp;emdash; I see, dance, laugh, sing;
<BR>As the hugging and loving bed-fellow sleeps at my side
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; through the night, and withdraws at the peep
of the day
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with stealthy tread,
<BR>Leaving me baskets cover'd with white towels swelling the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; house with their plenty,
<BR>Shall I postpone my acceptation and realization and scream
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at my eyes,
<BR>That they turn from gazing after and down the road,
<BR>And forthwith cipher and show me to a cent,
<BR>Exactly the value of one and exactly the value of two, and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which is ahead?

<P>Trippers and askers surround me,
<BR>People I meet, the effect upon me of my early life or the ward
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and city I live in, or the nation,
<BR>The latest dates, discoveries, inventions, societies, authors
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; old and new,
<BR>My dinner, dress, associates, looks, compliments, dues,
<BR>The real or fancied indifference of some man or woman I
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; love,
<BR>The sickness of one of my folks or of myself, or ill-doing or
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loss or lack of money, or depressions or exaltations,
<BR>Battles, the horrors of fratricidal war, the fever of doubtful
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; news, the fitful events;
<BR>These come to me days and nights and go from me again,
<BR>But they are not the Me myself.
<BR>Apart from the pulling and hauling stands what I am,
<BR>Stands amused, complacent, compassionating, idle,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unitary,
<BR>Looks down, is erect, or bends an arm on an impalpable
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; certain rest,
<BR>Looking with side-curved head curious what will come next,
<BR>Both in and out of the game and watching and wondering
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at it.

<P>&nbsp;Backward I see in my own days where I sweated through fog
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with linguists and contenders,
<BR>I have no mockings or arguments, I witness and wait.

<P>&nbsp;
<CENTER>5</CENTER>


<P>I believe in you my soul, the other I am must not abase itself
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to you,
<BR>And you must not be abased to the other.

<P>&nbsp;Loafe with me on the grass, loose the stop from your throat,
<BR>Not words, not music or rhyme I want, not custom or lecture,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not even the best,
<BR>Only the lull I like, the hum of your valved voice.

<P>&nbsp;I mind how once we lay such a transparent summer
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; morning,
<BR>How you settled your head athwart my hips and gently turn'd
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; over upon me,
<BR>And parted the shirt from my bosom-bone, and plunged your
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tongue to my bare-stript heart,
<BR>And reach'd till you felt my beard, and reach'd till you held
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my feet.

<P>&nbsp;Swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that pass all the argument of the earth,
<BR>And I know that the hand of God is the promise of my
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; own,
<BR>And I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own,
<BR>And that all the men ever born are also my brothers, and the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; women my sisters and lovers,

<P>&nbsp;And that a kelson of the creation is love,
<BR>And limitless are leaves stiff or drooping in the fields,
<BR>And brown ants in the little wells beneath them,
<BR>And mossy scabs of the worm fence, heap'd stones, elder,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mullein and poke-weed.

<P>A child said <I>What is the grass?</I> fetching it to me with full
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hands,
<BR>How could I answer the child? I do not know what it is any
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more than he.

<P>&nbsp;I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; green stuff woven.

<P>&nbsp;Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,
<BR>A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt,
<BR>Bearing the owner's name someway in the corners, that we
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may see and remark, and say <I>Whose?</I>

<P>&nbsp;Or I guess the grass is itself a child, the produced babe of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vegetation.

<P>&nbsp;Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,
<BR>And it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; zones,
<BR>Growing among black folks as among white,
<BR>Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; same, I receive them the same.

<P>&nbsp;And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.

<P>&nbsp;Tenderly will I use you curling grass,
<BR>It may be you transpire from the breasts of young men,
<BR>It may be if I had known them I would have loved them,
<BR>It may be you are from old people, or from offspring taken
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; soon out of their mothers' laps,
<BR>And here you are the mothers' laps.

<P>&nbsp;This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mothers,
<BR>Darker than the colourless beards of old men,
<BR>Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths.

<P>&nbsp;O I perceive after all so many uttering tongues,
<BR>And I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for nothing.

<P>&nbsp;I wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and women,
<BR>And the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; taken soon out of their laps.

<P>&nbsp;What do you think has become of the young and old men?
<BR>And what do you think has become of the women and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; children?

<P>&nbsp;They are alive and well somewhere,
<BR>The smallest sprout shows there is really no death,
<BR>And if ever there was it led forward life, and does not wait at
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the end to arrest it,
<BR>And ceas'd the moment life appear'd.

<P>&nbsp;All goes onward and outward, nothing collapses,
<BR>And to die is different from what any one supposed, and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; luckier.

<P>&nbsp;
<CENTER>7</CENTER>


<P>Has any one supposed it lucky to be born?
<BR>I hasten to inform him or her it is just as lucky to die, and I
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; know it.

<P>&nbsp;I pass death with the dying and birth with the new-wash'd
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; babe, and am not contain'd between my hat
and boots,
<BR>And peruse manifold objects, no two alike and every one
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; good,
<BR>The earth good and the stars good, and their adjuncts all
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; good.

<P>&nbsp;I am not an earth nor an adjunct of an earth,
<BR>I am the mate and companion of people, all just as immortal
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and fathomless as myself,
<BR>(They do not know how immortal, but I know.)

<P>&nbsp;Every kind for itself and its own, for me mine male and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; female,
<BR>For me those that have been boys and that love women,
<BR>For me the man that is proud and feels how it stings to be
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; slighted,

<P>&nbsp;For me the sweet-heart and the old maid, for me mothers and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the mothers of mothers,
<BR>For me lips that have smiled, eyes that have shed tears,
<BR>For me children and the begetters of children.

<P>&nbsp;Undrape! you are not guilty to me, nor stale nor discarded,
<BR>I see through the broadcloth and gingham whether or no,
<BR>And am around, tenacious, acquisitive, tireless, and cannot
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be shaken away.

<P>The little one sleeps in its cradle,
<BR>I lift the gauze and look a long time, and silently brush away

<P>&nbsp;The youngster and the red-faced girl turn aside up the bushy
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hill,
<BR>I peeringly view them from the top.

<P>&nbsp;The suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bedroom,
<BR>I witness the corpse with its dabbled hair, I note where the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pistol has fallen.

<P>&nbsp;The blab of the pave, tires of carts, sluff of boot-soles, talk
of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the promenaders,
<BR>The heavy omnibus, the driver with his interrogating thumb,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the clank of the shod horses on the granite
floor,
<BR>The snow-sleighs, clinking, shouted jokes, pelts of snow-balls,
<BR>The hurrahs for popular favorites, the fury of rous'd mobs,
<BR>The flap of the curtain'd litter, a sick man inside borne to the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hospital,
<BR>The meeting of enemies, the sudden oath, the blows and fall,
<BR>The excited crowd, the policeman with his star quickly
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; working his passage to the centre of the crowd,
<BR>The impassive stones that receive and return so many echoes,
<BR>What groans of over-fed or half-starv'd who fall sunstruck or
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in fits,
<BR>What exclamations of women taken suddenly who hurry
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; home and give birth to babes,

<P>&nbsp;What living and buried speech is always vibrating here, what
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; howls restrain'd by decorum,
<BR>Arrests of criminals, slights, adulterous offers made,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; acceptances, rejections with convex lips,

<P>The big doors of the country barn stand open and ready,
<BR>The dried grass of the harvest-time loads the slow-drawn
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wagon,
<BR>The clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged,
<BR>The armfuls are pack'd to the sagging mow.

<P>&nbsp;I am there, I help, I came stretch'd atop of the load,
<BR>I felt its soft jolts, one leg reclined on the other,
<BR>I jump from the cross-beams and seize the clover and

<BR>Falling asleep on the gather'd leaves with my dog and gun by
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my side.

<P>&nbsp;The Yankee clipper is under her sky-sails, she cuts the sparkle
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and scud,
<BR>My eyes settle the land, I bend at her prow or shout joyously
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from the deck.

<P>&nbsp;The boatmen and clam-diggers arose early and stopt for
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me,
<BR>I tuck'd my trowser-ends in my boots and went and had a
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; good time;
<BR>You should have been with us that day round the chowder-kettle.

<P>&nbsp;I saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; west, the bride was a red girl,
<BR>Her father and his friends sat near cross-legged and dumbly
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; smoking, they had moccasins to their feet
and large
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thick blankets hanging from their shoulders,
<BR>On a bank lounged the trapper, he was drest mostly in skins,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his luxuriant beard and curls protected his
neck, he held
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his bride by the hand,
<BR>She had long eyelashes, her head was bare, her coarse straight
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; locks descended upon her voluptuous limbs
and reach'd
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to her feet.

<P>&nbsp;The runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside,
<BR>I heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile,
<BR>Through the swung half-door of the kitchen I saw him limpsy
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and weak,
<BR>And went where he sat on a log and led him in and assured
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; him,
<BR>And brought water and fill'd a tub for his sweated body and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bruis'd feet,
<BR>And gave him a room that enter'd from my own, and gave
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; him some coarse clean clothes,
<BR>And remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness,
<BR>And remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ankles;
<BR>He staid with me a week before he was recuperated and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pass'd north,
<BR>I had him sit next me at table, my fire-lock lean'd in the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; corner.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flames, clack of sticks cooking my meals.

<BR>I hear all sounds running together, combined, fused or

<BR>Sounds of the city and sounds out of the city, sounds of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; day and night,
<BR>Talkative young ones to those that like them, the loud laugh
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of work-people at their meals,
<BR>The angry base of disjointed friendship, the faint tones of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sick,
<BR>The judge with hands tight to the desk, his pallid lips
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pronouncing a death-sentence,
<BR>The heave'e'yo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the refrain of the anchor-lifters,
<BR>The ring of alarm-bells, the cry of fire, the whirr of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; swift-streaking engines and hose-carts with
premonitory
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tinkles and color'd lights,
<BR>The steam-whistle, the solid roll of the train of approaching

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; two and two,

<P>&nbsp;I hear the violoncello, ('tis the young man's heart's complaint,)
<BR>I hear the key'd cornet, it glides quickly in through my ears,
<BR>It shakes mad-sweet pangs through my belly and breast.

<P>&nbsp;I hear the chorus, it is a grand opera,
<BR>Ah this indeed is music&amp;emdash;this suits me.

<P>&nbsp;A tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me,
<BR>The orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me full.

<P>&nbsp;I hear the train'd soprano (what work with hers is this?)
<BR>The orchestra whirls me wider than Uranus flies,
<BR>It wrenches such ardors from me I did not know I possess'd
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them,
<BR>It sails me, I dab with bare feet, they are lick'd by the indolent
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; waves,
<BR>I am cut by bitter and angry hail, I lose my breath,
<BR>Steep'd amid honey'd morphine, my windpipe throttled in

<P>&nbsp;Mine is no callous shell,
<BR>I have instant conductors all over me whether I pass or stop,
<BR>They seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me.

<P>&nbsp;I merely stir, press, feel with my fingers, and am happy,

<P>&nbsp;The sentries desert every other part of me,

<P>&nbsp;I am the hounded slave, I wince at the bite of the dogs,
<BR>Hell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; marksmen,
<BR>I clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn'd with the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ooze of my skin,
<BR>I fall on the weeds and stones,
<BR>The riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close,
<BR>Taunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whip-stocks.

<P>&nbsp;Agonies are one of my changes of garments,
<BR>I do not ask the wounded person how he feels, I myself
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; become the wounded person,
<BR>My hurts turn livid upon me as I lean on a cane and observe.

<P>&nbsp;I am the mash'd fireman with breast-bone broken,
<BR>Tumbling walls buried me in their debris,
<BR>Heat and smoke I inspired, I heard the yelling shouts of my
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; comrades,
<BR>I heard the distant click of their picks and shovels,
<BR>They have clear'd the beams away, they tenderly life me forth.

<P>&nbsp;I lie in the night air in my red shirt, the pervading hush is
for
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my sake,
<BR>Painless after all I lie exhausted but not so unhappy,
<BR>White and beautiful are the faces around me, the heads are

<BR>The kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches.

<P>&nbsp;Again the long roll of the drummers,

<BR>Again to my listeing ears the cannon responsive.

<P>&nbsp;I take part, I see and hear the whole,
<BR>The cries, curses, roar, the plaudits for well-aim'd shots,
<BR>The ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red drip,
<BR>Workmen searching after damages, making indispensable
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; repairs,
<BR>The fall of grenades through the rent roof, the fan-shaped

<P>&nbsp;Retreating they had form'd in a hollow square with their
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; baggage for breastworks,
<BR>Nine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemy's, nine
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; times their number, was the price they took
in advance,
<BR>Their colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone,
<BR>They treated for an honorable capitulation, receiv'd writing
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and seal, gave up their arms and march'd back
prisoners
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of war.

<P>&nbsp;They were the glory of the race of rangers,
<BR>Matchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, courtship,
<BR>Large, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; affectionate,
<BR>Bearded, sunburnt, drest in the free costume of hunters,
<BR>Not a single one over thirty years of age.

<P>&nbsp;The second First-day morning they were brought out in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; squads and massacred, it was beautiful early
summer,
<BR>The work commenced about five o'clock and was over by
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eight.

<P>&nbsp;None obey'd the command to kneel,
<BR>Some made a mad and helpless rush, some stood stark and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; straight,
<BR>A few fell at once, shot in the temple or heart, the living and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dead lay together,
<BR>The maim'd and mangled dug in the dirt, the new-comers saw
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them there,
<BR>Some half-kill'd attempted to crawl away,
<BR>These were despatch'd with bayonets or batter'd with the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blunts of muskets.
<BR>A youth not seventeen years old seiz'd his assassin till two
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more came to release him,
<BR>The three were all torn and cover'd with the boy's blood.

<P>&nbsp;At eleven o'clock began the burning of the bodies;
<BR>That is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; young men.

<P>Would you hear of an old-time sea-fight?
<BR>Would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars?
<BR>List to the yarn, as my grandmother's father the sailor told it
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to me.

<P>&nbsp;Our foe was no skulk in his ship I tell you, (said he,)
<BR>His was the surly English pluck, and there is no tougher or
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; truer, and never was, and never will be;
<BR>Along the lower'd eve he came horribly raking us.

<P>&nbsp;We closed with him, the yards entangled, the cannon touch'd,
<BR>My captain lash'd fast with his own hands.

<P>&nbsp;We had receiv'd some eighteen pound shots under the water,
<BR>On our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fire, killing all around and blowing up overhead.

<P>&nbsp;Fighting at sun-down, fighting at dark,
<BR>Ten o'clock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks on the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gain, and five feet of water reported,
<BR>The master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; after-hold to give them a chance for themselves.

<P>&nbsp;The transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels,
<BR>They see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust.

<P>&nbsp;Our frigate takes fire,
<BR>The other asks if we demand quarter?
<BR>If our colors are struck and the fighting done?

<P>&nbsp;Now I laugh content, for I hear the voice of my little captain,
<BR><I>We have not struck</I>, he composedly cries, <I>we have just begun</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; our part of the fighting</I>.

<P>&nbsp;Only three guns are in use,
<BR>One is directed by the captain himself against the enemy's
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; main-mast,
<BR>Two well serv'd with grape and canister silence his musketry
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and clear his decks.

<P>&nbsp;The tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the main-top,
<BR>They hold out bravely during the whole of the action.

<P>&nbsp;Not a moment's cease,
<BR>The leaks gain fast on the pumps, the fire eats toward the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; powder-magazine.

<P>&nbsp;One of the pumps has been shot away, it is generally thought
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we are sinking.

<P>&nbsp;Serene stands the little captain,
<BR>He is not hurried, his voice is neither high nor low,
<BR>His eyes give more light to us than our battle-lanterns.

<P>&nbsp;Toward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to us.

<P>&nbsp;Each who passes is consider'd, each who stops is consider'd,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not a single one can it fail.

<P>&nbsp;It cannot fail the young man who died and was buried,
<BR>Nor the young woman who died and was put by his side,
<BR>Nor the little child that peep'd in at the door, and then drew
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; back and was never seen again,

<P>&nbsp;Nor the old man who has lived without purpose, and feels it
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with bitterness worse than gall,
<BR>Nor him in the poor house tubercled by rum and the bad disorder,
<BR>Nor the numberless slaughter'd and wreck'd, nor the brutish
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; koboo call'd the ordure of humanity,
<BR>Nor the sacs merely floating with open mouths for food to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; slip in,
<BR>Nor any thing in the earth, or down in the oldest graves of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the earth,
<BR>Nor any thing in the myriads of spheres, nor the myriads of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; myriads that inhabit them,
<BR>Nor the present, nor the least wisp that is known.

<P>It is time to explain myself&amp;emdash;let us stand up.

<P>&nbsp;What is known I strip away,
<BR>I launch all men and women forward with me into the Unknown.

<P>&nbsp;The clock indicates the moment&amp;emdash;but what does eternity
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; indicate?

<P>&nbsp;We have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers,
<BR>There are trillions ahead, and trillions ahead of them.

<P>&nbsp;Births have brought us richness and variety,
<BR>And other births will bring us richness and variety.

<P>&nbsp;I do not call one greater and one smaller,
<BR>That which fills its period and place is equal to any.

<P>&nbsp;Were mankind murderous or jealous upon you, my brother,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my sister?
<BR>I am sorry for you, they are not murderous or jealous upon me,
<BR>All has been gentle with me, I keep no account with lamentation,
<BR>(What have I to do with lamentation?)

<P>&nbsp;I am an acme of things accomplish'd, and I an encloser of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; things to be.

<P>&nbsp;My feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs,
<BR>On every step bunches of ages, and larger bunches between
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the steps,
<BR>All below duly travel'd, and still I mount and mount.

<P>&nbsp;Rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me,
<BR>Afar down I see the huge first Nothing, I know I was even
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there,
<BR>I waited unseen and always, and slept through the lethargic
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mist,
<BR>And took my time, and took no hurt from the fetid carbon.

<P>&nbsp;Long I was hugg'd close&amp;emdash;long and long.

<P>&nbsp;Immense have been the preparations for me,
<BR>Faithful and friendly the arms that have help'd me.

<P>&nbsp;Cycles ferried my cradle, rowing and rowing like cheerful
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; boatmen,
<BR>For room to me stars kept aside in their own rings,
<BR>They sent influences to look after what was to hold me.

<P>&nbsp;Before I was born out of my mother generations guided me,
<BR>My embryo has never been torpid, nothing could overlay it.

<P>&nbsp;For it the nebula cohered to an orb,
<BR>The long slow strata piled to rest it on,
<BR>Vast vegetables gave it sustenance,
<BR>Monstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths and deposited
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it with care.

<P>&nbsp;All forces have been steadily employ'd to complete and delight
me,
<BR>Now on this spot I stand with my robust soul.

<P>O span of youth! ever-push'd elasticity!
<BR>O manhood, balanced, florid and full.

<P>&nbsp;My lovers suffocate me,
<BR>Crowding my lips, thick in the pores of my skin,
<BR>Jostling me through streets and public halls, coming naked to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me at night,
<BR>Crying by day <I>Ahoy</I>! from the rocks of the river, swinging
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and chirping over my head,
<BR>Calling my name from flower-beds, vines, tangled underbrush,
<BR>Lighting on every moment of my life,
<BR>Bussing my body with soft balsamic busses,
<BR>Noiselessly passing handfuls out of their hearts and giving
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them to be mine.

<P>&nbsp;Old age superbly rising! O welcome, ineffable grace of dying
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; days!

<P>&nbsp;Every condition promulges not only itself, it promulges what
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grows after and out of itself,
<BR>And the dark hush promulges as much as any.

<P>&nbsp;I open my scuttle at night and see the far-sprinkled systems,
<BR>And all I see multiplied as high as I can cipher edge but the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rim of the farther systems.

<P>&nbsp;Wider and wider they spread, expanding, always expanding,
<BR>Outward and outward and forever outward.

<P>&nbsp;My sun has his sun and round him obediently wheels,
<BR>He joins with his partners a group of superior circuit,
<BR>And greater sets follow, making specks of the greatest inside
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them.

<P>&nbsp;There is no stoppage and never can be stoppage,
<BR>If I, you, and the worlds, and all beneath or upon their surfaces,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; were this moment reduced back to a pallid
float, it would
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not avail in the long run,
<BR>We should surely bring up again where we now stand,
<BR>And surely go as much farther, and then farther and farther.

<P>&nbsp;A few quadrillions of eras, a few octillions of cubic leagues,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do not hazard the span or make it impatient,
<BR>They are but parts, any thing is but a part.

<P>&nbsp;See ever so far, there is limitless space outside of that,
<BR>Count ever so much, there is limitless time around that.

<P>&nbsp;My rendezvous is appointed, it is certain,
<BR>The Lord will be there and wait till I come on perfect terms,
<BR>The great Camerado, the lover true for whom I pine will be
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there.

<P>I know I have the best of time and space, and was never
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; measured and never will be measured.

<P>&nbsp;I tramp a perpetual journey, (come listen all!)
<BR>My signs are a rain-proof coat, good shoes, and a staff cut
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from the woods,
<BR>No friend of mine takes his ease in my chair,
<BR>I have no chair, no church, no philosophy,
<BR>I lead no man to a dinner-table, library, exchange,
<BR>But each man and each woman of you I lead upon a knoll,
<BR>My left hand hooking you round the waist,
<BR>My right hand pointing to landscapes of continents and the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public road.

<P>&nbsp;Not I, not any one else can travel that road for you,
<BR>You must travel it for yourself.

<P>&nbsp;It is not far, it is within reach,
<BR>Perhaps you have been on it since you were born and did not
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; know,
<BR>Perhaps it is everywhere on water and on land.

<P>&nbsp;Shoulder your duds dear son, and I will mine, and let us
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hasten forth,
<BR>Wonderful cities and free nations we shall fetch as we go.

<P>&nbsp;If you tire, give me both burdens, and rest the chuff of your
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hand on my hip,
<BR>And in due time you shall repay the same service to me,
<BR>For after we start we never lie by again.

<P>&nbsp;This day before dawn I ascended a hill and look'd at the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; crowded heaven,
<BR>And I said to my spirit <I>When we become the enfolders of those</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; orbs, and the pleasure and knowledge of
every thing in</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them, shall we be fill'd and satisfied
then</I>?
<BR>And my spirit said <I>No, we but level that lift to pass and</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; continue beyond</I>.

<P>&nbsp;You are also asking me questions and I hear you,
<BR>I answer that I cannot answer, you must find out for yourself.

<P>&nbsp;Sit a while dear son,
<BR>Here are biscuits to eat and here is milk to drink,
<BR>But as soon as you sleep and renew yourself in sweet clothes,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I kiss you with a good-by kiss and open the
gate for your
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; egress hence.

<P>&nbsp;Long enough have you dream'd contemptible dreams,
<BR>Now I wash the gum from your eyes,
<BR>You must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light and of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; every moment of your life.

<P>&nbsp;Long have you timidly waded holding a plank by the shore,
<BR>Now I will you to be a bold swimmer,
<BR>To jump off in the midst of the sea, rise again, nod to me,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shout, and laughingly dash with your hair.

<P>I am the teacher of athletes,
<BR>He that by me spreads a wider breast than my own proves

<BR>He most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; teacher.

<P>&nbsp;The boy I love, the same becomes a man not through derived
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; power, but in his own right,
<BR>Wicked rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear,
<BR>Fond of his sweetheart, relishing well his steak,
<BR>Unrequited love or a slight cutting him worse than sharp
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; steel cuts,

<P>&nbsp;First-rate to ride, to fight, to hit the bull's eye, to sail a
skiff,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to sing a song or play on the banjo,
<BR>Preferring scars and the beard and faces pitted with
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; small-pox over all latherers,
<BR>And those well-tann'd to those that keep out of the sun.

<P>&nbsp;I teach straying from me, yet who can stray from me?
<BR>I follow you whoever you are from the present hour,
<BR>My words itch at your ears till you understand them.

<P>&nbsp;I do not say these things for a dollar or to fill up the time
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while I wait for a boat,
<BR>(It is you talking just as much as myself, I act as the tongue of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you,
<BR>Tied in your mouth, in mine it begins to be loosen'd.)

<P>&nbsp;I swear I will never again mention love or death inside a
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; house,
<BR>And I swear I will never translate myself at all, only to him or
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; her who privately stays with me in the open
air.

<P>&nbsp;If you would understand me go to the heights or
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; water-shore,
<BR>The nearest gnat is an explanation, and a drop or motion of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; waves a key,
<BR>The maul, the oar, the hand-saw, second my words.

<P>&nbsp;No shutter'd room or school can commune with me,
<BR>But roughs and little children better than they.

<P>&nbsp;The young mechanic is closest to me, he knows me well,
<BR>The woodman that takes his axe and jug with him shall take
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me with him all day,
<BR>The farm-boy ploughing in the field feels good at the sound
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of my voice,
<BR>In vessels that sail my words sail, I go with fishermen and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seamen and love them.

<P>&nbsp;The soldier camp'd or upon the march is mine,
<BR>On the night ere the pending battle many seek me, and I do
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not fail them,

<P>&nbsp;On that solemn night (it may be their last) those that know
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me seek me.

<P>&nbsp;My face rubs to the hunter's face when he lies down alone in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his blanket,
<BR>The driver thinking of me does not mind the jolt of his wagon,
<BR>The young mother and old mother comprehend me,
<BR>The girl and the wife rest the needle a moment and forget
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where they are,
<BR>They and all would resume what I have told them.

<P>I have said that the soul is not more than the body,
<BR>And I have said that the body is not more than the soul,
<BR>And nothing, not God, is greater to one than one's self is,
<BR>And whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; own funeral drest in his shroud,
<BR>And I or you pocketless of a dime may purchase the pick of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the earth,
<BR>And to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; confounds the learning of all times,
<BR>And there is no trade or employment but the young man
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; following it may become a hero,
<BR>And there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wheel'd universe,
<BR>And I say to any man or woman, Let your soul stand cool
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and composed before a million universes.

<P>&nbsp;And I say to mankind, Be not curious about God,
<BR>For I who am curious about each am not curious about
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God,
<BR>(No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God and about death.)

<P>&nbsp;I hear and behold God in every object, yet understand God
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not in the least,
<BR>Nor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; myself.

<P>&nbsp;Why should I wish to see God better than this day?
<BR>I see something of God each hour of the twenty-four, and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; each moment then,
<BR>In the faces of men and women I see God, and in my own
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; face in the glass,
<BR>I find letters from God dropt in the street, and every one is
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sign'd by God's name,
<BR>And I leave them where they are, for I know that wheresoe'er
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I go,
<BR>Others will punctually come for ever and ever.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; decay in the muck,
<BR>Toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs.

<P>&nbsp;I ascend from the moon, I ascend from the night,
<BR>I perceive that the ghastly glimmer is noonday sunbeams
