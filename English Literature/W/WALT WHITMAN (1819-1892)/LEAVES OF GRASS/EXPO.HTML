<P>(A<FONT SIZE=-1>H</FONT> little recks the laborer,
<BR>How near his work is holding him to God,
<BR>The loving Laborer through space and time.)

<P>&nbsp;After all not to create only, or found only,
<BR>But to bring perhaps from afar what is already
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; founded,
<BR>To give it our own identity, average, limitless, free,
<BR>To fill the gross the torpid bulk with vital religious
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fire,
<BR>Not to repel or destroy so much as accept, fuse, rehabilitate,
<BR>To obey as well as command, to follow more than to lead,
<BR>These also are the lessons of our New World;
<BR>While how little the New after all, how much the Old,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Old World!

<P>&nbsp;Long and long has the grass been growing,
<BR>Long and long has the rain been falling,
<BR>Long has the globe been rolling round.

<P>Come Muse migrate from Greece and Ionia,
<BR>Cross out please those immensely overpaid accounts,
<BR>That matter of Troy and Achilles' wrath, and &AElig;neas</q>,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Odysseus' wanderings,
<BR>Placard&nbsp;<qq>Removed</qq> and&nbsp;<qq>To Let</qq> on the rocks
of your
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; snowy Parnassus,
<BR>Repeat at Jerusalem, place the notice high on Jaffa's gate
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and on Mount Moriah,
<BR>The same on the walls of your German, French and Spanish
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; castles, and Italian collections,
<BR>For know a better, fresher, busier sphere, a wide, untried
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; domain awaits, demands you.

<P>Responsive to our summons,
<BR>Or rather to her long-nurs'd inclination,
<BR>Join'd with an irresistible, natural gravitation,
<BR>She comes! I hear the rustling of her gown,
<BR>I scent the odor of her breath's delicious fragrance,
<BR>I mark her step divine, her curious eyes a-turning, rolling,
<BR>Upon this very scene.

<P>&nbsp;The dame of dames! can I believe then,
<BR>Those ancient temples, sculptures classic, could none of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them retain her?
<BR>Nor shades of Virgil and Dante, nor myriad memories,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; poems, old associations, magnetize and hold
on to her?
<BR>But that she's left them all &amp;emdash; and here?

<P>&nbsp;Yes, if you will allow me to say so,
<BR>I, my friends, if you do not, can plainly see her,
<BR>The same undying soul of earth's, activity's, beauty's,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heroism's expression,
<BR>Out from her evolutions hither come, ended the strata of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; her former themes,

<P>&nbsp;Hidden and cover'd by to-day's, foundation of to-day's,
<BR>Ended, deceas'd through time, her voice by Castaly's fountain,
<BR>Silent the broken-lipp'd Sphynx in Egypt, silent all those
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; century-baffling tombs,
<BR>Ended for aye the epics of Asia's, Europe's helmeted warriors,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ended the primitive call of the muses,
<BR>Calliope's call forever closed, Clio, Melpomene, Thalia dead,
<BR>Ended the stately rhythmus of Una and Oriana, ended the quest
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the Holy Graal,
<BR>Jerusalem a handful of ashes blown by the wind, extinct,
<BR>The Crusaders' streams of shadowy midnight troops sped with
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the sunrise,
<BR>Amadis, Tancred, utterly gone, Charlemagne, Roland, Oliver
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gone,
<BR>Palmerin, ogre, departed, vanish'd the turrets that Usk from
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; its waters reflected,
<BR>Arthur vanish'd with all his knights, Merlin and Lancelot and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Galahad, all gone, dissolv'd utterly like
an exhalation;
<BR>Pass'd! pass'd! for us, forever pass'd, that once so mighty
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; world, now void, inanimate, phantom world,
<BR>Embroider'd, dazzling, foreign world, with all its gorgeous
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; legends, myths,
<BR>Its kings and castles proud, its priests and warlike lords
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and courtly dames,
<BR>Pass'd to its charnel vault, coffin'd with crown and armor on,
<BR>Blazon'd with Shakspere's purple page,
<BR>And dirged by Tennyson's sweet sad rhyme.

<P>&nbsp;I say I see, my friends, if you do not, the illustrious emigr&eacute;,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (having it is true in her day, although the
same, changed,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; journey'd considerable,)
<BR>Making directly for this rendezvous, vigorously clearing a
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; path for herself, striding through the confusion,
<BR>By thud of machinery and shrill steam-whistle undismay'd,
<BR>Bluff'd not a bit by drain-pipe, gasometers, artificial fertilizers,
<BR>Smiling and pleas'd with palpable intent to stay,
<BR>She's here, install'd amid the kitchen ware!

<P>But hold &amp;emdash; don't I forget my manners?
<BR>To introduce the stranger, (what else indeed do I live to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chant for?) to thee Columbia;
<BR>In liberty's name welcome immortal! clasp hands,
<BR>And ever henceforth sisters dear be both.

<P>&nbsp;Fear not O Muse! truly new ways and days receive,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; surround you,
<BR>I candidly confess a queer, queer race, of novel fashion,
<BR>And yet the same old human race, the same within, without,
<BR>Faces and hearts the same, feelings the same, yearnings the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; same,
<BR>The same old love, beauty and use the same.

<P>We do not blame thee elder World, nor really separate
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ourselves from thee,
<BR>(Would the son separate himself from the father?)
<BR>Looking back on thee, seeing thee to thy duties, grandeurs,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; through past ages bending, building,
<BR>We build to ours to-day.

<P>&nbsp;Mightier than Egypt's tombs,
<BR>Fairer than Grecia's, Roma's temples,
<BR>Prouder then Milan's statued, spired, cathedral,
<BR>More picturesque than Rhenish castle-keeps,
<BR>We plan even now to raise, beyond them all,
<BR>Thy great cathedral sacred industry, no tomb,
<BR>A keep for life for practical invention.

<P>&nbsp;As in a waking vision,
<BR>E'en while I chant I see it rise, I scan and prophesy outside
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and in,
<BR>Its manifold ensemble.

<P>&nbsp;Around a palace, loftier, fairer, ampler than any yet,
<BR>Earth's modern wonder, history's seven outstripping,
<BR>High rising tier on tier with glass and iron fa&ccedil;ades,
<BR>Gladdening the sun and sky, enhued in cheerfulest hues,

<P>&nbsp;Bronze, lilac, robin's-egg, marine and crimson,
<BR>Over whose golden roof shall flaunt, beneath thy banner
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freedom,
<BR>The banners of the States and flags of every land,
<BR>A brood of lofty, fair, but lesser palaces shall cluster.

<P>&nbsp;Somewhere within their walls shall all that forwards perfect
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; human life be started,
<BR>Tried, taught, advanced, visibly exhibited.

<P>&nbsp;Not only all the world of works, trade, products,
<BR>But all the workmen of the world here to be represented.

<P>&nbsp;Here shall you trace in flowing operation,
<BR>In every state of practical, busy movement, the rills of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; civilization,
<BR>Materials here under your eye shall change their shape as
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if by magic,
<BR>The cotton shall be pick'd almost in the very field,
<BR>Shall be dried, clean'd, ginn'd, baled, spun into thread
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and cloth before you,
<BR>You shall see hands at work at all the old processes and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all the new ones,
<BR>You shall see the various grains and how flour is made and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then bread baked by the bakers,
<BR>You shall see the crude ores of California and Nevada passing
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on and on till they become bullion,
<BR>You shall watch how the printer sets type, and learn what a
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; composing-stick is,
<BR>You shall mark in amazement the Hoe press whirling its cylinders,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shedding the printed leaves steady and fast,
<BR>The photograph, model, watch, pin, nail, shall be created
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; before you.

<P>&nbsp;In large calm halls, a stately museum shall teach you the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; infinite lessons of minerals,
<BR>In another, woods, plants, vegetation shall be illustrated
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;emdash; in another animals, animal life
and development.

<P>&nbsp;One stately house shall be the music house,
<BR>Others for other arts &amp;emdash; learning, the sciences, shall
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all be here,

<P>&nbsp;None shall be slighted, none but shall here be honor'd,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; help'd, exampled.

<P>(This, this and these, America, shall be <I>your</I> pyramids and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; obelisks,
<BR>Your Alexandrian Pharos, gardens of Babylon,
<BR>Your temple at Olympia.)

<P>&nbsp;The male and female many laboring not,
<BR>Shall ever here confront the laboring many,
<BR>With precious benefits to both, glory to all,
<BR>To thee America, and thee eternal Muse.

<P>&nbsp;And here shall ye inhabit powerful Matrons!
<BR>In your vast state vaster than all the old,
<BR>Echoed through long, long centuries to come,
<BR>To sound of different, prouder songs, with stronger themes,
<BR>Practical, peaceful life, the people's life, the People themselves,
<BR>Lifted, illumin'd, bathed in peace &amp;emdash; elate, secure in peace.

<P>Away with themes of war! away with war itself!
<BR>Hence from my shuddering sight to never more return that
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; show of blacken'd, mutilated corpses!
<BR>That hell unpent and raid of blood, fit for wild tigers or for
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lop-tongued wolves, not reasoning men,
<BR>And in its stead speed industry's campaigns,
<BR>With thy undaunted armies, engineering,
<BR>Thy pennants labor, loosen'd to the breeze,
<BR>Thy bugles sounding loud and clear.

<P>&nbsp;Away with old romance!
<BR>Away with novels, plots and plays of foreign courts,
<BR>Away with love-verses, sugar'd in rhyme, the intrigues,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; amours of idlers,
<BR>Fitted for only banquets of the night where dancers to late
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; music slide,
<BR>The unhealthy pleasures, extravagant dissipation of the few,

<P>&nbsp;With perfumes, heat and wine, beneath the dazzling chandeliers.

<P>&nbsp;To you ye reverent sane sisters,
<BR>I raise a voice for far superber themes for poets and for art,
<BR>To exalt the present and the real,
<BR>To teach the average man the glory of his daily walk and trade,
<BR>To sing in songs how exercise and chemical life are never to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be baffled,
<BR>To manual work for each and all, to plough, hoe, dig,
<BR>To plant and tend the tree, the berry, vegetables, flowers,
<BR>For every man to see to it that he really do something, for
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; every woman too;
<BR>To use the hammer and the saw, (rip, or cross-cut,)
<BR>To cultivate a turn for carpentering, plastering, painting,
<BR>To work as tailor, tailoress, nurse, hostler, porter,
<BR>To invent a little, something ingenious, to aid the washing,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cooking, cleaning,
<BR>And hold it no disgrace to take a hand at them themselves.

<P>&nbsp;I say I bring thee Muse to-day and here,
<BR>All occupations, duties broad and close,
<BR>Toil, healthy toil and sweat, endless, without cessation,
<BR>The old, old practical burdens, interests, joys,
<BR>The family, parentage, childhood, husband and wife,
<BR>The house-comforts, the house itself and all its belongings,
<BR>Food and its preservation, chemistry applied to it,
<BR>Whatever forms the average, strong, complete, sweet-blooded
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; man or woman, the perfect longeve personality,
<BR>And helps its present life to health and happiness, and shapes
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; its soul,
<BR>For the eternal real life to come.

<P>&nbsp;With latest connections, works, the inter-transportation of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the world,
<BR>Steam-power, the great express lines, gas, petroleum,
<BR>These triumphs of our time, the Atlantic's delicate cable,
<BR>The Pacific railroad, the Suez canal, the Mont Cenis and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gothard and Hoosac tunnels, the Brooklyn bridge,

<P>&nbsp;This earth all spann'd with iron rails, with lines of steamships
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; threading every sea,
<BR>Our own rondure, the current globe I bring.

<P>And thou America,
<BR>Thy offspring towering e'er so high, yet higher Thee above
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all towering,
<BR>With Victory on thy left, and at thy right hand Law;
<BR>Thou Union holding all, fusing, absorbing, tolerating all,
<BR>Thee, ever thee, I sing.

<P>&nbsp;Thou, also thou, a World,
<BR>With all thy wide geographies, manifold, different, distant,
<BR>Rounded by thee in one &amp;emdash; one common orbic language,
<BR>One common indivisible destiny for All.

<P>&nbsp;And by the spells which ye vouchsafe to those your ministers
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in earnest,
<BR>I here personify and call my themes, to make them pass
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; before ye.

<P>&nbsp;Behold, America! (and thou, ineffable guest and sister!)
<BR>For thee come trooping up thy waters and thy lands;
<BR>Behold! thy fields and farms, thy far-off woods and mountains,
<BR>As in procession coming.

<P>&nbsp;Behold, the sea itself,
<BR>And on its limitless, heaving breast, the ships;
<BR>See, where their white sails, bellying in the wind, speckle the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; green and blue,
<BR>See, the steamers coming and going, steaming in or out of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; port,
<BR>See, dusky and undulating, the long pennants of smoke.

<P>&nbsp;Behold, in Oregon, far in the north and west,
<BR>Or in Maine, far in the north and east, they cheerful axemen,
<BR>Wielding all day their axes.

<P>&nbsp;Behold, on the lakes, thy pilots at their wheels, thy oarsmen,
<BR>How the ash writhes under those muscular arms!

<P>&nbsp;There by the furnace, and there by the anvil,
<BR>Behold thy sturdy blacksmiths swinging their sledges,
<BR>Overhand so steady, overhand they turn and fall with joyous
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clank,
<BR>Like a tumult of laughter.

<P>&nbsp;Mark the spirit of invention everywhere, thy rapid patents,
<BR>Thy continual workshops, foundries, risen or rising,
<BR>See, from their chimneys how the tall flame-fires stream.

<P>&nbsp;Mark, thy interminable farms, North, South,
<BR>Thy wealthy daughter-states, Eastern and Western,
<BR>The varied products of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Missouri,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Georgia, Texas, and the rest,
<BR>Thy limitless crops, grass, wheat, sugar, oil, corn,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rice, hemp, hops,
<BR>Thy barns all fill'd, the endless freight-train and the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bulging storehouse,
<BR>The grapes that ripen on thy vines, the apples in thy
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; orchards,
<BR>Thy incalculable lumber, beef, pork, potatoes, thy coal,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thy gold and silver,
<BR>The inexhaustible iron in thy mines.

<P>&nbsp;All thine, O sacred Union!
<BR>Ships, farms, shops, barns factories, mines,
<BR>City and State, North, South, item and aggregate,
<BR>We dedicate, dread Mother, all to thee!

<P>&nbsp;Protectress absolute, thou! bulwark of all!
<BR>For well we know that while thou givest each and all,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (generous as God,)
<BR>Without thee neither all nor each, nor land, home,
<BR>Nor ship, nor mine, nor any here this day secure,
<BR>Nor aught, nor any day secure.

<P>And thou, the Emblem waving over all!
<BR>Delicate beauty, a word to thee, (it may be salutary,)

<P>&nbsp;Remember thou hast not always been as here to-day so
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; comfortably ensovereign'd,
<BR>In other scenes than these have I observ'd thee flag,
<BR>Not quite so trim and whole and freshly blooming in folds
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of stainless silk,
<BR>But I have seen thee bunting, to tatters torn upon thy
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; splinter'd staff,
<BR>Or clutch'd to some young color-bearer's breast with
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; desperate hands,
<BR>Savagely struggled for, for life or death, fought over long,
<BR>'Mid cannons' thunder-crash and many a curse and groan
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and yell, and rifle-volleys cracking sharp,
<BR>And moving masses as wild demons surging, and lives as
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing risk'd,
<BR>For thy mere remnant grimed with dirt and smoke and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sopp'd in blood,
<BR>For sake of that, my beauty, and that thou might'st dally
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as now secure up there,
<BR>Many a good man have I seen go under.

<P>&nbsp;Now here and these and hence in peace, all thine, O flag!
<BR>And here and hence for thee, O universal Muse! and thou for
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them!
<BR>And here and hence O Union, all the work and workmen thine!
<BR>None separate from thee &amp;emdash; henceforth One only, we
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and thou,
<BR>(For the blood of the children, what is it, only the blood maternal?
<BR>And lives and works, what are they all at last, except the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; roads to faith and death?)

<P>&nbsp;While we rehearse our measureless wealth, it is for thee, dear
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mother,
<BR>We own it all and several to-day indissoluble in thee;
<BR>Think not our chant, our show, merely for products gross or
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lucre &amp;emdash; it is for thee, the soul
in thee, electric, spiritual!
<BR>Our farms, inventions, crops, we own in thee! cities and States
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in thee!
<BR>Our freedom all in thee! our very lives in thee!
