<I>Song of the Answerer</I></H1></CENTER>
Now list to my morning's romanza, I tell the signs of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Answerer,
<BR>To the cities and farms I sing as they spread in the sunshine
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; before me.

<P>&nbsp;A young man comes to me bearing a message from his brother,
<BR>How shall the young man know the whether and when of his
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; brother?
<BR>Tell him to send me the signs.

<P>&nbsp;And I stand before the young man face to face, and take his
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; right hand in my left hand and his left hand
in my right hand,
<BR>And I answer for his brother and for men, and I answer for him
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that answers for all, and send these signs.

<P>&nbsp;Him all wait for, him all yield up to, his word is decisive
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and final,
<BR>Him they accept, in him lave, in him perceive themselves as
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; amid light,
<BR>Him they immerse and he immerses them.

<P>&nbsp;Beautiful women, the haughtiest nations, laws, the landscape,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; people, animals,
<BR>The profound earth and its attributes and the unquiet ocean,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (so tell I my morning's romanza,)
<BR>All enjoyments and properties and money, and whatever money
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will buy,
<BR>The best farms, others toiling and planting and he unavoidably reaps,
<BR>The noblest and costliest cities, others grading and building and he
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; domiciles there,
<BR>Nothing for any one but what is for him, near and far are for him,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the ships in the offing,
<BR>The perpetual shows and marches on land are for him if they
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are for anybody.

<P>&nbsp;He puts things in their attitudes,
<BR>He puts to-day out of himself with plasticity and love,
<BR>He places his own times, reminiscences, parents, brothers and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sisters, associations, employment, politics,
so that the rest
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; never shame them afterward, nor assume to
command them.

<P>&nbsp;He is the Answerer,
<BR>What can be answer'd he answers, and what cannot be answer'd
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he shows how it cannot be answer'd.

<P>&nbsp;A man is a summons and challenge,
<BR>(It is vain to skulk&amp;emdash;do you hear that mocking and laughter?
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do you hear the ironical echoes?)

<P>&nbsp;Books, friendships, philosophers, priests, action, pleasure,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pride, beat up and down seeking to give satisfaction,
<BR>He indicates the satisfaction, and indicates them that beat up
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and down also.

<P>&nbsp;Whichever the sex, whatever the season or place, he may go
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; freshly and gently and safely by day or by
night,
<BR>He has the pass-key of hearts, to him the response of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prying of hands on the knobs.

<P>&nbsp;His welcome is universal, the flow of beauty is not more
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; welcome or universal than he is,
<BR>The person he favors by day or sleeps with at night is blessed.

<P>&nbsp;Every existence has its idiom, every thing has an idiom and tongue,
<BR>He resolves all tongues into his own and bestows it upon men, and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any man translates, and any man translates
himself also,
<BR>One part does not counteract another part, he is the joiner,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he sees how they join.

<P>&nbsp;He says indifferently and alike <I>How are you friend?</I> to
the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; President at his levee,
<BR>And he says <I>Good-day my brother</I>, to Cudge that hoes in the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sugar-field,
<BR>And both understand him and know that his speech is right.

<P>&nbsp;He walks with perfect ease in the capitol,
<BR>He walks among the Congress, and one Representative says
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to another, <I>Here is our equal appearing
and new</I>.

<P>&nbsp;Then the mechanics take him for a mechanic,
<BR>And the soldiers suppose him to be a soldier, and the sailors
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that he has follow'd the sea,
<BR>And the authors take him for an author, and the artists for
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an artist,
<BR>And the laborers perceive he could labor with them and love
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them,
<BR>No matter what the work is, that he is the one to follow it or
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has follow'd it,
<BR>No matter what the nation, that he might find his brothers
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and sisters there.

<P>&nbsp;The English believe he comes of their English stock,
<BR>A Jew to the Jew he seems, a Russ to the Russ, usual and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; near, removed from none.

<P>&nbsp;Whoever he looks at in the traveler's coffee-house claims him,
<BR>The Italian or Frenchman is sure, the German is sure, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spaniard is sure, and the island Cuban is
sure,

<P>&nbsp;The engineer, the deck-hand on the great lakes, or on the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mississippi or St. Lawrence or Sacramento,
or Hudson
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or Paumanok sound, claims him.

<P>&nbsp;The gentleman of perfect blood acknowledges his perfect blood,
<BR>The insulter, the prostitute, the angry person, the beggar, see
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; themselves in the ways of him, he strangely
transmutes them,
<BR>They are not vile any more, they hardly know themselves they
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are so grown.

<P>The indications and tally of time,
<BR>Perfect sanity shows the master among philosophs,
<BR>Time, always without break, indicates itself in parts,
<BR>What always indicates the poet is the crowd of the pleasant
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; company of singers, and their words,
<BR>The words of the singers are the hours or minutes of the light
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or dark, but the words of the maker of poems
are the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; general light and dark,
<BR>The maker of poems settles justice, reality, immortality,
<BR>His insight and power encircle things and the human race,
<BR>He is the glory and extract thus far of things and of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; human race.

<P>&nbsp;The singers do not beget, only the Poet begets,
<BR>The singers are welcom'd, understood, appear often enough,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but rare has the day been, likewise the spot,
of the birth
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the maker of poems, the Answerer,
<BR>(Not every century nor every five centuries has contain'd
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; such a day, for all its names.)

<P>&nbsp;The singers of successive hours of centuries may have ostensible
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; names, but the name of each of them is one
of the singers,
<BR>The name of each is, eye-singer, ear-singer, head-singer,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sweet-singer, night-singer, parlor-singer,
love-singer,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; weird-singer, or something else.

<P>&nbsp;All this time and at all times wait the words of true poems,
<BR>The words of true poems do not merely please,
<BR>The true poets are not followers of beauty but the august
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; masters of beauty;
<BR>The greatness of sons is the exuding of the greatness of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mothers and fathers,
<BR>The words of true poems are the tuft and final applause of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; science.

<P>&nbsp;Divine instinct, breadth of vision, the law of reason, health,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rudeness of body, withdrawnness,
<BR>Gayety, sun-tan, air-sweetness, such are some of the words
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of poems.

<P>&nbsp;The sailor and traveler underlie the maker of poems, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Answerer,
<BR>The builder, geometer, chemist, anatomist, phrenologist, artist,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all these underlie the maker of poems, the
Answerer.

<P>&nbsp;The words of the true poems give you more than poems,
<BR>They give you to form for yourself poems, religions, politics,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; war, peace, behavior, histories, essays, daily
life, and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; every thing else,
<BR>They balance ranks, colors, races, creeds, and the sexes,
<BR>They do not seek beauty, they are sought,
<BR>Forever touching them or close upon them follows beauty,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; longing, fain, love-sick.

<P>&nbsp;They prepare for death, yet they are not the finish, but rather
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the outset,
<BR>They bring none to his or her terminus or to be content and full,
<BR>Whom they take they take into space to behold the birth of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stars, to learn one of the meanings,
<BR>To launch off with absolute faith, to sweep through the ceaseless
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rings and never be quiet again.
