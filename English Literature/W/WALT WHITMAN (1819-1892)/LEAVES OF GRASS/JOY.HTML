<I>A Song of Joys</I></H1></CENTER>
O <FONT SIZE=-1>TO</FONT> make the most jubilant song!
<BR>Full of music&amp;emdash;full of manhood, womanhood, infancy!
<BR>Full of common employments&amp;emdash;full of grain and trees.

<P>&nbsp;O for the voices of animals&amp;emdash;O for the swiftness and
balance
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of fishes!
<BR>O for the dropping of raindrops in a song!
<BR>O for the sunshine and motion of waves in a song!

<P>&nbsp;O the joy of my spirit&amp;emdash;it is uncaged&amp;emdash;it
darts like
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lightning!
<BR>It is not enough to have this globe or a certain time,
<BR>I will have thousands of globes and all time.

<P>&nbsp;O the engineer's joys! to go with a locomotive!
<BR>To hear the hiss of steam, the merry shriek, the steam-whistle,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the laughing locomotive!
<BR>To push with resistless way and speed off in the distance.

<P>&nbsp;O the gleesome saunter over fields and hillsides!
<BR>The leaves and flowers of the commonest weeds, the moist fresh
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stillness of the woods,
<BR>The exquisite smell of the earth at daybreak, and all through
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the forenoon.

<P>&nbsp;O the horseman's and horsewoman's joys!
<BR>The saddle, the gallop, the pressure upon the seat, the cool
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gurgling by the ears and hair.

<P>&nbsp;O the fireman's joys!
<BR>I hear the alarm at dead of night,
<BR>I hear bells, shouts! I pass the crowd, I run!
<BR>The sight of the flames maddens me with pleasure.

<P>&nbsp;O the joy of the strong-brawn'd fighter, towering in the arena
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in perfect condition, conscious of power,
thirsting to meet
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his opponent.

<P>&nbsp;O the joy of that vast elemental sympathy which only the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; human soul is capable of generating and emitting
in steady
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and limitless floods.

<P>&nbsp;O the mother's joys!
<BR>The watching, the endurance, the precious love, the anguish,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the patiently yielded life.

<P>&nbsp;O the joy of increase, growth, recuperation,
<BR>The joy of soothing and pacifying, the joy of concord and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; harmony.

<P>&nbsp;O to go back to the place where I was born,
<BR>To hear the birds sing once more,
<BR>To ramble about the house and barn and over the fields
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; once more,
<BR>And through the orchard and along the old lanes once more.

<P>&nbsp;O to have been brought up on bays, lagoons, creeks, or along
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the coast,
<BR>To continue and be employ'd there all my life,
<BR>The briny and damp smell, the shore, the salt weeds exposed at
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; low water,
<BR>The work of fishermen, the work of the eel-fisher and clam-fisher;
<BR>I come with my clam-rake and spade, I come with my eel-spear,
<BR>Is the tide out? I join the group of clam-diggers on the flats,
<BR>I laugh and work with them, I joke at my work like a mettle-some
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; young man;
<BR>In winter I take my eel-basket and eel-spear and travel out on
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; foot on the ice&amp;emdash;I have a small
axe to cut holes in the ice,

<P>&nbsp;Behold me well-clothed going gayly or returning in the afternoon,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my brood of tough boys accompanying me,
<BR>My brood of grown and part-grown boys, who love to be with no
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one else so well as they love to be with me,
<BR>By day to work with me, and by night to sleep with me.

<P>&nbsp;Another time in warm weather out in a boat, to lift the lobster-pots
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where they are sunk with heavy stones, (I
know the buoys,)
<BR>O the sweetness of the Fifth-month morning upon the water as I
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; row just before sunrise toward the buoys,
<BR>I pull the wicker pots up slantingly, the dark green lobsters are
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; desperate with their claws as I take them
out, I insert wooden
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pegs in the joints of their pincers,
<BR>I go to all the places one after another, and then row back
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the shore,
<BR>There in a huge kettle of boiling water the lobsters shall be
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; boil'd till their color becomes scarlet.

<P>&nbsp;Another time mackerel-taking,
<BR>Voracious, mad for the hook, near the surface, they seem to fill
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the water for miles;
<BR>Another time fishing for rock-fish in Chesapeake Bay, I one of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the brown-faced crew;
<BR>Another time trailing for blue-fish off Paumanok, I stand with
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; braced body,
<BR>My left foot is on the gunwale, my right arm throws far out the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; coils of slender rope,
<BR>In sight around me the quick veering and darting of fifty skiffs,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my companions.

<P>&nbsp;O boating on the rivers,
<BR>The voyage down the St. Lawrence, the superb scenery, the steamers,
<BR>The ships sailing, the Thousand Islands, the occasional timber-raft
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the raftsmen with long-reaching sweepoars,
<BR>The little huts on the rafts, and the stream of smoke when they
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cook supper at evening.

<P>&nbsp;(O something pernicious and dread!
<BR>Something far away from a puny and pious life!
<BR>Something unproved! something in a trance!
<BR>Something escaped from the anchorage and driving free.)

<P>&nbsp;O to work in mines, or forging iron,
<BR>Foundry casting, the foundry itself, the rude high roof, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ample and shadow'd space,
<BR>The furnace, the hot liquid pour'd out and running.

<P>&nbsp;O to resume the joys of the soldier!
<BR>To feel the presence of a brave commanding officer&amp;emdash;to feel
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his sympathy!
<BR>To behold his calmness&amp;emdash;to be warm'd in the rays of his smile!
<BR>To go to battle&amp;emdash;to hear the bugles play and the drums beat!
<BR>To hear the crash of artillery&amp;emdash;to see the glittering of
the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bayonets and musket-barrels in the sun!
<BR>To see men fall and die and not complain!
<BR>To taste the savage taste of blood&amp;emdash;to be so devilish!
<BR>To gloat so over the wounds and deaths of the enemy.

<P>&nbsp;O the whaleman's joys! O I cruise my old cruise again!
<BR>I feel the ship's motion under me, I feel the Atlantic breezes
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fanning me,
<BR>I hear the cry again sent down from the mast-head, <I>There</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;emdash;she blows!</I>
<BR>Again I spring up the rigging to look with the rest&amp;emdash;we
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; descend, wild with excitement,
<BR>I leap in the lower'd boat, we row toward our prey where he lies,
<BR>We approach stealthy and silent, I see the mountainous mass,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lethargic, basking,
<BR>I see the harpooner standing up, I see the weapon dart from
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his vigorous arm;
<BR>O swift again far out in the ocean the wounded whale, settling,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; running to windward, tows me,
<BR>Again I see him rise to breathe, we row close again,
<BR>I see a lance driven through his side, press'd deep, turn'd
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the wound,

<P>&nbsp;Again we back off, I see him settle again, the life is leaving
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; him fast,
<BR>As he rises he spouts blood, I see him swim in circles narrower and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; narrower, swiftly cutting the water&amp;emdash;I
see him die,
<BR>He gives one convulsive leap in the centre of the circle, and then
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; falls flat and still in the bloody foam.

<P>&nbsp;O the old manhood of me, my noblest joy of all!
<BR>My children and grand-children, my white hair and beard,
<BR>My largeness, calmness, majesty, out of the long stretch of my life.

<P>&nbsp;O ripen'd joy of womanhood! O happiness at last!
<BR>I am more than eighty years of age, I am the most venerable mother,
<BR>How clear is my mind&amp;emdash;how all people draw night to me!
<BR>What attractions are these beyond any before? what bloom more
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than the bloom of youth?
<BR>What beauty is this that descends upon me and rises out of me?

<P>&nbsp;O the orator's joys!
<BR>To inflate the chest, to roll the thunder of the voice out from
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the ribs and throat,
<BR>To make the people rage, weep, hate, desire, with yourself,
<BR>To lead America&amp;emdash;to quell America with a great tongue.

<P>&nbsp;O the joy of my soul leaning pois'd on itself, receiving
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; identity through materials and loving them,
observing
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; characters and absorbing them,
<BR>My soul vibrated back to me from them, from sight, hearing,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; touch, reason, articulation, comparison, memory,
and the like,
<BR>The real life of my senses and flesh transcending my senses and flesh,
<BR>My body done with materials, my sight done with my material eyes,
<BR>Proved to me this day beyond cavil that it is not my material eyes
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which finally see,
<BR>Nor my material body which finally loves, walks, laughs, shouts,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; embraces, procreates.

<P>&nbsp;O the farmer's joys!
<BR>Ohioan's, Illinoisian's, Wisconsinese', Kanadian's, Iowan's,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kansian's, Missourian's, Oregonese' joys!
<BR>To rise at peep of day and pass forth nimbly to work,
<BR>To plough land in the fall for winter-sown crops,
<BR>To plough land in the spring for maize,
<BR>To train orchards, to graft the trees, to gather apples in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the fall.

<P>&nbsp;O to bathe in the swimming-bath, or in a good place along
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shore,
<BR>To splash the water! to walk ankle-deep, or race naked along
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the shore.

<P>&nbsp;O to realize space!
<BR>The plenteousness of all, that there are no bounds,
<BR>To emerge and be of the sky, of the sun and moon and flying
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clouds, as one with them.

<P>&nbsp;O the joy of a manly self-hood!
<BR>To be servile to none, to defer to none, not to any tyrant
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; known or unknown,
<BR>To walk with erect carriage, a step springy and elastic,
<BR>To look with calm gaze or with a flashing eye,
<BR>To speak with a full and sonorous voice out of a broad chest,
<BR>To confront with your personality all the other personalities of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the earth.

<P>&nbsp;Know'st thou the excellent joys of youth?
<BR>Joys of the dear companions and of the merry word and laughing
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; face?
<BR>Joy of the glad light-beaming day, joy of the wide-breath'd games?
<BR>Joy of sweet music, joy of the lighted ball-room and the dancers?
<BR>Joy of the plenteous dinner, strong carouse and drinking?

<P>&nbsp;Yet O my soul supreme!
<BR>Know'st thou the joys of pensive thought?
<BR>Joys of the free and lonesome heart, the tender, gloomy heart?

<P>&nbsp;Joys of the solitary walk, the spirit bow'd yet proud, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suffering and the struggle?
<BR>The agonistic throes, the ecstasies, joys of the solemn musings
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; day or night?
<BR>Joys of the thought of Death, the great spheres Time and Space?
<BR>Prophetic joys of better, loftier love's ideals, the divine wife,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the sweet, eternal, perfect comrade?
<BR>Joys all thine own undying one, joys worthy thee O soul.

<P>&nbsp;O while I live to be the ruler of life, not a slave,
<BR>To meet life as a powerful conqueror,
<BR>No fumes, no ennui, no more complaints or scornful criticisms,
<BR>To these proud laws of the air, the water and the ground,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; proving my interior soul impregnable,
<BR>And nothing exterior shall ever take command of me.

<P>&nbsp;For not life's joys alone I sing, repeating&amp;emdash;the joy
of death!
<BR>The beautiful touch of Death, soothing and benumbing a few
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; moments, for reasons,
<BR>Myself discharging my excrementitious body to be burn'd, or
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; render'd to powder, or buried,
<BR>My real body doubtless left to me for other spheres,
<BR>My voided body nothing more to me, returning to the purifications,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; further offices, eternal uses of the earth.

<P>&nbsp;O to attract by more than attraction!
<BR>How it is I know not&amp;emdash;yet behold! the something which
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; obeys none of the rest,
<BR>It is offensive, never defensive&amp;emdash;yet how magnetic it draws.

<P>&nbsp;O to struggle against great odds, to meet enemies undaunted!
<BR>To be entirely alone with them, to find how much one can stand!
<BR>To look strife, torture, prison, popular odium, face to face!
<BR>To mount the scaffold, to advance to the muzzles of guns
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with perfect nonchalance!
<BR>To be indeed a God!

<P>&nbsp;O to sail to sea in a ship!
<BR>To leave this steady unendurable land,
<BR>To leave the tiresome sameness of the streets, the sidewalks and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the houses,
<BR>To leave you O you solid motionless land, and entering a ship,
<BR>To sail and sail and sail!

<P>&nbsp;O to have life henceforth a poem of new joys!
<BR>To dance, clap hands, exult, shout, skip, leap, roll on, float on!
<BR>To be a sailor of the world bound for all ports,
<BR>A ship itself, (see indeed these sails I spread to the sun and air,)
<BR>A swift and swelling ship full of rich words, full of joys.
