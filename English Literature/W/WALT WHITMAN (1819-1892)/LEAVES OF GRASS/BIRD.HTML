<P>C<FONT SIZE=-1>OME</FONT> said the Muse,
<BR>Sing me a song no poet yet has chanted,
<BR>Sing me the universal.

<P>&nbsp;In this broad earth of ours,
<BR>Amid the measureless grossness and the slag,
<BR>Enclosed and safe within its central heart,
<BR>Nestles the seed perfection.

<P>&nbsp;By every life a share or more or less,
<BR>None born but it is born, conceal'd or unconceal'd the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seed is waiting.

<P>Lo! keen-eyed towering science,
<BR>As from tall peaks the modern overlooking,
<BR>Successive absolute fiats issuing.

<P>&nbsp;Yet again, lo! the soul, above all science,
<BR>For it has history gather'd like husks around the globe,
<BR>For it the entire star-myriads roll through the sky.

<P>&nbsp;In spiral routes by long detours,
<BR>(As a much-tacking ship upon the sea,)
<BR>For it the partial to the permanent flowing,
<BR>For it the real to the ideal tends.

<P>&nbsp;For it the mystic evolution,
<BR>Not the right only justified, what we call evil also
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; justified.

<P>&nbsp;Forth from their masks, no matter what,
<BR>From the huge festering trunk, from craft and guile
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and tears,
<BR>Health to emerge and joy, joy universal.

<P>&nbsp;Out of the bulk, the morbid and the shallow,
<BR>Out of the bad majority, the varied countless frauds
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of men and states,
<BR>Electric, antiseptic yet, cleaving, suffusing all,
<BR>Only the good is universal.

<P>Over the mountain-growths disease and sorrow,
<BR>An uncaught bird is ever hovering, hovering,
<BR>High in the purer, happier air.

<P>&nbsp;From imperfection's murkiest cloud,
<BR>Darts always forth one ray of perfect light,
<BR>One flash of heaven's glory.

<P>&nbsp;To fashion's, custom's discord,
<BR>To the mad Babel-din, the deafening orgies,
<BR>Soothing each lull a strain is heard, just heard,
<BR>From some far shore the final chorus sounding.

<P>&nbsp;O the blest eyes, the happy hearts,
<BR>That see, that know the guiding thread so fine,
<BR>Along the mighty labyrinth.

<P>And thou America,
<BR>For the scheme's culmination, its thought and its
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reality,
<BR>For these (not for thyself) thou hast arrived.

<P>&nbsp;Thou too surroundest all,
<BR>Embracing carrying welcoming all, thou too by path-
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ways broad and new,
<BR>To the ideal tendest.

<P>&nbsp;The measur'd faiths of other lands, the grandeurs of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the past,
<BR>Are not for thee, but grandeurs of thine own,
<BR>Deific faiths and amplitudes, absorbing, comprehending
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all,
<BR>All eligible to all.

<P>&nbsp;All, all for immortality,
<BR>Love like the light silently wrapping all,
<BR>Nature's amelioration blessing all,
<BR>The blossoms, fruits of ages, orchards divine and certain,
<BR>Forms, objects, growths, humanities, to spiritual images
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ripening.

<P>&nbsp;Give me O God to sing that thought,
<BR>Give me, give him or her I love this quenchless faith
<BR>In Thy ensemble, whatever else withheld withhold not
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from us,
<BR>Belief in plan of Thee enclosed in Time and Space,
<BR>Health, peace, salvation universal.

<P>&nbsp;Is it a dream?
<BR>Nay but the lack of it the dream,
<BR>And failing it life's lore and wealth a dream,
<BR>And all the world a dream.

TO YOU</H2></CENTER>
W<FONT SIZE=-1>HOEVER</FONT> you are, I fear you are walking the walks
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of dreams,
<BR>I fear these supposed realities are to melt from under your
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; feet and hands,
<BR>Even now your features, joys, speech, house, trade, manners,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; troubles, follies, costume, crimes, dissipate
away from you,
<BR>Your true soul and body appear before me,
<BR>They stand forth out of affairs, out of commerce, shops, work,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; farms, clothes, the house, buying, selling,
eating, drinking,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suffering, dying.

<P>&nbsp;Whoever you are, now I place my hand upon you, that you be
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my poem,
<BR>I whisper with my lips close to your ear,
<BR>I have loved many women and men, but I love none better than
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you.

<P>&nbsp;O I have been dilatory and dumb,
<BR>I should have made my way straight to you long ago,

<P>&nbsp;I should have blabb'd nothing but you, I should have chanted
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing but you.

<P>&nbsp;I will leave all and come and make the hymns of you,
<BR>None has understood you, but I understand you,
<BR>None has done justice to you, you have not done justice
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to yourself,
<BR>None but has found you imperfect, I only find no imperfection
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in you,
<BR>None but would subordinate you, I only am he who will never
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; consent to subordinate you,
<BR>I only am he who places over you no master, owner, better,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God, beyond what waits intrinsically in yourself.

<P>&nbsp;Painters have painted their swarming groups and the centre-
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; figure of all,
<BR>From the head of the centre-figure spreading a nimbus of gold-
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; color'd light,
<BR>But I paint myriads of heads, but paint no head without its
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nimbus of gold-color'd light,
<BR>From my hand from the brain of every man and woman it
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; streams, effulgently flowing forever.

<P>&nbsp;O I could sing such grandeurs and glories about you!
<BR>You have not known what you are, you have slumber'd upon
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yourself all your life,
<BR>Your eyelids have been the same as closed most of the time,
<BR>What you have done returns already in mockeries,
<BR>(Your thrift, knowledge, prayers, if they do not return in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mockeries, what is their return?)

<P>&nbsp;The mockeries are not you,
<BR>Underneath them and within them I see you lurk,
<BR>I pursue you where none else has pursued you,
<BR>Silence, the desk, the flippant expression, the night, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; accustom'd routine, if these conceal you from
others or
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from yourself, they do not conceal you from
me,
<BR>The shaved face, the unsteady eye, the impure complexion, if
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; these balk others they do not balk me,
<BR>The pert apparel, the deform'd attitude, drunkenness, greed,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; premature death, all these I part aside.

<P>&nbsp;There is no endowment in man or woman that is not tallied in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you,
<BR>There is no virtue, no beauty in man or woman, but as good is
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in you,
<BR>No plunk, no endurance in others, but as good is in you,
<BR>No pleasure waiting for others, but an equal pleasure waits
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for you.

<P>&nbsp;As for me, I give nothing to any one except I give the like
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; carefully to you,
<BR>I sing the songs of the glory of none, not God, sooner than
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sing the songs of the glory of you.

<P>&nbsp;Whoever you are! claim your own at any hazard!
<BR>These shows of the East and West are tame compared to you,
<BR>These immense meadows, these interminable rivers, you are
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; immense and interminable as they,
<BR>These furies, elements, storms, motions of Nature, throes of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; apparent dissolution, you are he or she who
is master or
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mistress over them,
<BR>Master or mistress in your own right over Nature, elements,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pain, passion, dissolution.

<P>&nbsp;The hopples fall from your ankles, you find an unfailing
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sufficiency,
<BR>Old or young, male or female, rude, low, rejected by the rest,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whatever you are promulges itself,
<BR>Through birth, life, death, burial, the means are provided,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing is scanted,
<BR>Through angers, losses, ambition, ignorance, ennui, what you
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are picks its way.

<P>A <FONT SIZE=-1>GREAT</FONT> year and place,
<BR>A harsh discordant natal scream out-sounding, to touch the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mother's heart closer than any yet.

<P>&nbsp;I walk'd the shores of my Eastern sea,
<BR>Heard over the waves the little voice,
<BR>Saw the divine infant where she woke mournfully wailing, amid
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the roar of cannon, curses, shouts, crush
of falling buildings,
<BR>Was not so sick from the blood in the gutters running, nor from
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the single corpses, nor those in heaps, nor
those borne away
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the tumbrils,
<BR>Was not so desperate at the battues of death&amp;emdash;was not
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so shock'd at the repeated fusillades of the
guns.

<P>&nbsp;Pale, silent, stern, what could I say to that long-accrued
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; retribution?
<BR>Could I wish humanity different?
<BR>Could I wish the people made of wood and stone?
<BR>Or that there be no justice in destiny or time?

<P>&nbsp;O liberty! O mate for me!
<BR>Here too the blaze, the grape-shot and the axe, in reserve,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to fetch them out in case of need,
<BR>Here too, though long represt, can never be destroy'd,
<BR>Here too could rise at last murdering and ecstatic,
<BR>Here too demanding full arrears of vengeance.

<P>&nbsp;Hence I sign this salute over the sea,
<BR>And I do not deny that terrible red birth and baptism,
<BR>But remember the little voice that I heard wailing, and wait
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with perfect trust, no matter how long,
<BR>And from to-day sad and cogent I maintain the bequeath'd
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cause, as for all lands,
<BR>And I send these words to Paris with my love,
<BR>And I guess some chansonniers there will understand them,
<BR>For I guess there is latent music yet in France, floods of it,
<BR>O I hear already the bustle of instruments, they will soon
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be drowning all that would interrupt them,
<BR>O I think the east wind brings a triumphal and free march,
<BR>It reaches hither, it swells me to joyful madness,
<BR>I will run transpose it in words, to justify it,
<BR>I will yet sing a song for you ma femme.

<H2>
MYSELF AND MINE</H2></CENTER>
M<FONT SIZE=-1>YSELF</FONT> and mine gymnastic ever,
<BR>To stand the cold or heat, to make good aim with a gun, to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sail a boat, to manage horses, to beget superb
children,
<BR>To speak readily and clearly, to feel at home among common
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; people,
<BR>And to hold our own in terrible positions on land and sea.

<P>&nbsp;Not for an embroiderer,
<BR>(There will always be plenty of embroiderers, I welcome
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them also,)
<BR>But for the fibre of things and for inherent men and women.

<P>&nbsp;Not to chisel ornaments,
<BR>But to chisel with free stroke the heads and limbs of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; plenteous supreme Gods, that the States may
realize
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them walking and talking.

<P>&nbsp;Let me have my own way,
<BR>Let others promulge the laws, I will make no account of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the laws,
<BR>Let others praise eminent men and hold up peace, I hold up
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; agitation and conflict,
<BR>I praise no eminent man, I rebuke to his face the one that
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was thought most worthy.

<P>&nbsp;(Who are you? and what are you secretly guilty of all your
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; life?
<BR>Will you turn aside all your life? will you grub and chatter
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all your life?
<BR>And who are you, blabbing by rote, years, pages, languages,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reminiscences,
<BR>Unwitting to-day that you do not know how to speak properly
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a single word?)

<P>&nbsp;Let others finish specimens, I never finish specimens,
<BR>I start them by exhaustless laws as Nature does, fresh and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; modern continually.

<P>&nbsp;I give nothing as duties,
<BR>What others give as duties I give as living impulses,
<BR>(Shall I give the heart's action as a duty?)

<P>&nbsp;Let others dispose of questions, I dispose of nothing, I
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arouse unanswerable questions,
<BR>Who are they I see and touch, and what about them?
<BR>What about these likes of myself that draw me so close
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by tender directions and indirections?

<P>&nbsp;I call to the world to distrust the accounts of my friends,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but listen to my enemies, as I myself do,
<BR>I charge you forever reject those who would expound
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me, for I cannot expound myself,
<BR>I charge that there be no theory or school founded out
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of me,
<BR>I charge you to leave all free, as I have left all free.

<P>&nbsp;After me, vista!
<BR>O I see life is not short, but immeasurably long,
<BR>I henceforth tread the world chaste, temperate, an early
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; riser, a steady grower,
<BR>Every hour the semen of centuries, and still of centuries.
<BR>I must follow up these continual lessons of the air, water,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; earth,
<BR>I perceive I have no time to lose.

YEAR OF METEORS</H2></CENTER>

<P>Y<FONT SIZE=-1>EAR</FONT> of meteors! brooding year!
<BR>I would bind in words retrospective some of your deeds
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and signs,
<BR>I would sing your contest for the 19th Presidentiad,
<BR>I would sing how an old man, tall, with white hair,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mounted the scaffold in Virginia,
<BR>(I was at hand, silent I stood with teeth shut close, I
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; watch'd,

<P>&nbsp;I stood very near you old man when cool and indifferent,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but trembling with age and your unheal'd wounds,
you
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mounted the scaffold;)
<BR>I would sing in my copious song your census returns of the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; States,
<BR>The tables of population and products, I would sing of your
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ships and their cargoes,
<BR>The proud black ships of Manhattan arriving, some fill'd with
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; immigrants, some from the isthmus with cargoes
of gold,
<BR>Songs thereof would I sing, to all that hitherward comes
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; would I welcome give,
<BR>And you would I sing, fair stripling! welcome to you from me,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; young prince of England!
<BR>(Remember you surging Manhattan's crowds as you pass'd
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with your cortege of nobles?
<BR>There in the crowds stood I, and singled you out with attachment;)
<BR>Nor forget I to sing of the wonder, the ship as she swam up
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my bay,
<BR>Well-shaped and stately the Great Eastern swam up my
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bay, she was 600 feet long,
<BR>Her moving swiftly surrounded by myriads of small craft I
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; forget not to sing;
<BR>Nor the comet that came unannounced out of the north
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flaring in heaven,
<BR>Nor the strange huge meteor-procession dazzling and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clear shooting over our heads,
<BR>(A moment, a moment long it sail'd its balls of unearthly
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; light over our heads,
<BR>Then departed, dropt in the night, and was gone;)
<BR>Of such, and fitful as they, I sing &amp;emdash; with gleams
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from them would I gleam and patch these chants,
<BR>Your chants, O year all mottled with evil and good
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;emdash; year of forebodings!
<BR>Year of comets and meteors transient and strange
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;emdash; lo! even here one equally transient
and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strange!
<BR>As I flit through you hastily, soon to fall and be gone,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what is this chant,
<BR>What am I myself but one of your meteors?

<P>O but it is not the years &amp;emdash; it is I, it is You,
<BR>We touch all laws and tally all antecedents,
<BR>We are the skald, the oracle, the monk and the knight, we
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; easily include them and more,
<BR>We stand amid time beginningless and endless, we stand
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; amid evil and good,
<BR>All swings around us, there is as much darkness as light,
<BR>The very sun swings itself and its system of planets around
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; us,
<BR>Its sun, and its again, all swing around us.
<BR>As for me, (torn, stormy, amid these vehement days,)
<BR>I have the idea of all, and am all and believe in all,

<P>&nbsp;I believe materialism is true and spiritualism is true, I
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reject no part.
<BR>(Have I forgotten any part? any thing in the past?
<BR>Come to me whoever and whatever, till I give you
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recognition.)
<BR>I respect Assyria, China, Teutonia, and the Hebrews,
<BR>I adopt each theory, myth, god, and demi-god,
<BR>I see that the old accounts, bibles, genealogies, are true,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without exception,
<BR>I assert that all past days were what they must have been,
<BR>And that they could no-how have been better than they
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; were,
<BR>And that to-day is what it must be, and that America is,
<BR>And that to-day and America could no-how be better than
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they are.
