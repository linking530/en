<P>I <FONT SIZE=-1>SING</FONT> the body electric,

<BR>They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them,
<BR>And discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the soul.

<P>&nbsp;Was it doubted that those who corrupt their own bodies
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conceal themselves?

<P>&nbsp;And if those who defile the living are as bad as they who defile
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the dead?
<BR>And if the body does not do fully as much as the soul?

<P>The love of the body of man or woman balks account, the body
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; itself balks account,
<BR>That of the male is perfect, and that of the female is perfect.

<P>&nbsp;The expression of the face balks account,
<BR>But the expression of a well-made man appears not only in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his face,
<BR>It is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the joints of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his hips and wrists,
<BR>It is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his waist
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and knees, dress does not hide him,
<BR>The strong sweet quality he has strikes through the cotton
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and broad-cloth,
<BR>To see him pass conveys as much as the best poem, perhaps
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more,
<BR>You linger to see his back, and the back of his neck and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shoulder-side.

<P>&nbsp;The sprawl and fulness of babes, the bosoms and heads of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; women, the folds of their dress, their style
as we pass in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the street, the contour of their shape downwards,
<BR>The swimmer naked in the swimming-bath, seen as he swims
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; through the transparent green-shine, or lies
with his face
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; up and rolls silently to and fro in the heave
of the water,
<BR>The bending forward and backward of rowers in row-boats,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the horseman in his saddle,
<BR>Girls, mothers, house-keepers, in all their performances,
<BR>The group of laborers seated at noon-time with their open
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dinner kettles, and their wives waiting,
<BR>The female soothing a child, the farmer's daughter in the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; garden or cow-yard,
<BR>The young fellow hoeing corn, the sleigh-driver driving his
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; six horses through the crowd,

<P>&nbsp;The wrestle of wrestlers, two apprentice-boys, quite grown,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lusty, good-natured, native-born, out on the
vacant lot
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at sundown after work,
<BR>The coats and caps thrown down, the embrace of love and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resistance,
<BR>The upper-hold and under-hold, the hair rumpled over and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blinding the eyes;
<BR>The march of firemen in their own costumes, the play of masculine
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; muscle through clean-setting trowsers and
waist-straps,
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>The slow return from the fire, the pause when the bell strikes
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suddenly again, and the listening on the alert,
<BR>The natural, perfect, varied attitudes, the bent head, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; curv'd neck and the counting;
<BR>Such-like I love &amp;emdash; I loosen myself, pass freely, am at the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mother's breast with the little child,
<BR>Swim with the swimmers, wrestle with wrestlers, march in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; line with the firemen, and pause, listen,
count.

<P>I knew a man, a common farmer, the father of five sons,
<BR>And in them the fathers of sons, and in them the fathers of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sons.

<P>&nbsp;This man was of wonderful vigor, calmness, beauty of person,
<BR>The shape of his head, the pale yellow and white of his hair
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and beard, the immeasurable meaning of his
black eyes,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the richness and breadth of his manners,
<BR>These I used to go and visit him to see, he was wise also,
<BR>He was six feet tall, he was over eighty years old, his sons
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; were massive, clean, bearded, tan-faced, handsome,
<BR>They and his daughters loved him, all who saw him loved him,
<BR>They did not love him by allowance, they loved him with
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; personal love,
<BR>He drank water only, the blood show'd like scarlet through
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the clear-brown skin of his face,
<BR>He was a frequent gunner and fisher, he sail'd his boat himself,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a fine one presented to him by a ship-joiner,
he had
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fowling-pieces presented to him by men that
loved him,

<P>&nbsp;When he went with his five sons and many grand-sons to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hunt or fish, you would pick him out as the
most beautiful
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and vigorous of the gang,
<BR>You would wish long and long to be with him, you would wish to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sit by him in the boat that you and he might
touch each other.

<P>I have perceiv'd that to be with those I like is enough,
<BR>To stop in company with the rest at evening is enough,
<BR>To be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breathing, laughing
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flesh is enough,
<BR>To pass among them or touch any one, or rest my arm ever
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so lightly round his or her neck for a moment,
what is this then?
<BR>I do not ask any more delight, I swim in it as in a sea.

<P>&nbsp;There is something in staying close to men and women and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; looking on them, and in the contact and odor
of them,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that pleases the soul well,
<BR>All things please the soul, but these please the soul well.

<BR>Books, art, religion, time, the visible and solid earth, and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what was expected of heaven or fear'd of hell,
are now

<BR>Mad filaments, ungovernable shoots play out of it, the response
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; likewise ungovernable,
<BR>Hair, bosom, hips, bend of legs, negligent falling hands all diffused,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mine too diffused,
<BR>Ebb stung by the flow and flow stung by the ebb, love-flesh
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; swelling and deliciously aching,
<BR>Limitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous, quivering
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; jelly of love, white-blow and delirious juice,

<P>&nbsp;Bridegroom night of love working surely and softly into the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prostrate dawn,

man is

<P>&nbsp;Be not ashamed women, your privilege encloses the rest, and
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is the exit of the rest,
<BR>You are the gates of the body, and you are the gates of the soul.

<P>&nbsp;The female contains all qualities and tempers them,
<BR>She is in her place and moves with perfect balance,
<BR>She is all things duly veil'd, she is both passive and active,
<BR>She is to conceive daughters as well as sons, and sons as well
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as daughters.

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; him well,
<BR>The wildest largest passions, bliss that is utmost, sorrow that

<BR>Do you think matter has cohered together from its diffuse float, and
