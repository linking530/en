Chapter 8 - In Transit</H3>
The eighth chapter is exceedingly brief, and relates that Gibbins, the
amateur naturalist of the district, while lying out on the spacious open
downs without a soul within a couple of miles of him, as he thought, and
almost dozing, heard close to him the sound as of a man coughing, sneezing,
and then swearing savagely to himself; and looking, beheld nothing. Yet
the voice was indisputable. It continued to swear with that breadth and
variety that distinguishes the swearing of a cultivated man. It grew to
a climax, diminished again, and died away in the distance, going as it
seemed to him in the direction of Adderdean. It lifted to a spasmodic sneeze
and ended. Gibbins had heard nothing of the morning's occurrences, but
the phenomenon was so striking and disturbing that his philosophical tranquillity
vanished; he got up hastily, and hurried down the steepness of the hill
towards the village, as fast as he could go.
