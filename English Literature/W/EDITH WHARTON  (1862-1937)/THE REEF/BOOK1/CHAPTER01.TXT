"Unexpected obstacle.  Please don't come till thirtieth.

Anna."



All the way from Charing Cross to Dover the train had

hammered the words of the telegram into George Darrow's

ears, ringing every change of irony on its commonplace

syllables: rattling them out like a discharge of musketry,

letting them, one by one, drip slowly and coldly into his

brain, or shaking, tossing, transposing them like the dice

in some game of the gods of malice; and now, as he emerged

from his compartment at the pier, and stood facing the wind-

swept platform and the angry sea beyond, they leapt out at

him as if from the crest of the waves, stung and blinded him

with a fresh fury of derision.



"Unexpected obstacle.  Please don't come till thirtieth.

Anna."



She had put him off at the very last moment, and for the

second time: put him off with all her sweet reasonableness,

and for one of her usual "good" reasons--he was certain that

this reason, like the other, (the visit of her husband's

uncle's widow) would be "good"!  But it was that very

certainty which chilled him.  The fact of her dealing so

reasonably with their case shed an ironic light on the idea

that there had been any exceptional warmth in the greeting

she had given him after their twelve years apart.



They had found each other again, in London, some three

months previously, at a dinner at the American Embassy, and

when she had caught sight of him her smile had been like a

red rose pinned on her widow's mourning.  He still felt the

throb of surprise with which, among the stereotyped faces of

the season's diners, he had come upon her unexpected face,

with the dark hair banded above grave eyes; eyes in which he

had recognized every little curve and shadow as he would

have recognized, after half a life-time, the details of a

room he had played in as a child.  And as, in the plumed

starred crowd, she had stood out for him, slender, secluded

and different, so he had felt, the instant their glances

met, that he as sharply detached himself for her.  All that

and more her smile had said; had said not merely "I

remember," but "I remember just what you remember"; almost,

indeed, as though her memory had aided his, her glance flung

back on their recaptured moment its morning brightness.

Certainly, when their distracted Ambassadress--with the cry:

"Oh, you know Mrs. Leath?  That's perfect, for General

Farnham has failed me"--had waved them together for the

march to the diningroom, Darrow had felt a slight pressure

of the arm on his, a pressure faintly but unmistakably

emphasizing the exclamation: "Isn't it wonderful?--In

London--in the season--in a mob?"



Little enough, on the part of most women; but it was a sign

of Mrs. Leath's quality that every movement, every syllable,

told with her.  Even in the old days, as an intent grave-

eyed girl, she had seldom misplaced her light strokes; and

Darrow, on meeting her again, had immediately felt how much

finer and surer an instrument of expression she had become.



Their evening together had been a long confirmation of this

feeling.  She had talked to him, shyly yet frankly, of what

had happened to her during the years when they had so

strangely failed to meet.  She had told him of her marriage

to Fraser Leath, and of her subsequent life in France, where

her husband's mother, left a widow in his youth, had been

re-married to the Marquis de Chantelle, and where, partly in

consequence of this second union, the son had permanently

settled himself.  She had spoken also, with an intense

eagerness of affection, of her little girl Effie, who was

now nine years old, and, in a strain hardly less tender, of

Owen Leath, the charming clever young stepson whom her

husband's death had left to her care...





A porter, stumbling against Darrow's bags, roused him to the

fact that he still obstructed the platform, inert and

encumbering as his luggage.



"Crossing, sir?"



Was he crossing?  He really didn't know; but for lack of any

more compelling impulse he followed the porter to the

luggage van, singled out his property, and turned to march

behind it down the gang-way.  As the fierce wind shouldered

him, building up a crystal wall against his efforts, he felt

anew the derision of his case.



"Nasty weather to cross, sir," the porter threw back at him

as they beat their way down the narrow walk to the pier.

Nasty weather, indeed; but luckily, as it had turned out,

there was no earthly reason why Darrow should cross.



While he pushed on in the wake of his luggage his thoughts

slipped back into the old groove.  He had once or twice run

across the man whom Anna Summers had preferred to him, and

since he had met her again he had been exercising his

imagination on the picture of what her married life must

have been.  Her husband had struck him as a characteristic

specimen of the kind of American as to whom one is not quite

clear whether he lives in Europe in order to cultivate an

art, or cultivates an art as a pretext for living in Europe.

Mr. Leath's art was water-colour painting, but he practised

it furtively, almost clandestinely, with the disdain of a

man of the world for anything bordering on the professional,

while he devoted himself more openly, and with religious

seriousness, to the collection of enamelled snuff-boxes.  He

was blond and well-dressed, with the physical distinction

that comes from having a straight figure, a thin nose, and

the habit of looking slightly disgusted--as who should not,

in a world where authentic snuff-boxes were growing daily

harder to find, and the market was flooded with flagrant

forgeries?



Darrow had often wondered what possibilities of communion

there could have been between Mr. Leath and his wife.  Now

he concluded that there had probably been none.  Mrs.

Leath's words gave no hint of her husband's having failed to

justify her choice; but her very reticence betrayed her.

She spoke of him with a kind of impersonal seriousness, as

if he had been a character in a novel or a figure in

history; and what she said sounded as though it had been

learned by heart and slightly dulled by repetition.  This

fact immensely increased Darrow's impression that his

meeting with her had annihilated the intervening years.

She, who was always so elusive and inaccessible, had grown

suddenly communicative and kind: had opened the doors of her

past, and tacitly left him to draw his own conclusions.  As

a result, he had taken leave of her with the sense that he

was a being singled out and privileged, to whom she had

entrusted something precious to keep.  It was her happiness

in their meeting that she had given him, had frankly left

him to do with as he willed; and the frankness of the

gesture doubled the beauty of the gift.



Their next meeting had prolonged and deepened the

impression.  They had found each other again, a few days

later, in an old country house full of books and pictures,

in the soft landscape of southern England. The presence of a

large party, with all its aimless and agitated

displacements, had served only to isolate the pair and give

them (at least to the young man's fancy) a deeper feeling of

communion, and their days there had been like some musical

prelude, where the instruments, breathing low, seem to hold

back the waves of sound that press against them.



Mrs. Leath, on this occasion, was no less kind than before;

but she contrived to make him understand that what was so

inevitably coming was not to come too soon.  It was not that

she showed any hesitation as to the issue, but rather that

she seemed to wish not to miss any stage in the gradual

reflowering of their intimacy.



Darrow, for his part, was content to wait if she wished it.

He remembered that once, in America, when she was a girl,

and he had gone to stay with her family in the country, she

had been out when he arrived, and her mother had told him to

look for her in the garden.  She was not in the garden, but

beyond it he had seen her approaching down a long shady

path.  Without hastening her step she had smiled and signed

to him to wait; and charmed by the lights and shadows that

played upon her as she moved, and by the pleasure of

watching her slow advance toward him, he had obeyed her and

stood still. And so she seemed now to be walking to him down

the years, the light and shade of old memories and new hopes

playing variously on her, and each step giving him the

vision of a different grace.  She did not waver or turn

aside; he knew she would come straight to where he stood;

but something in her eyes said "Wait", and again he obeyed

and waited.



On the fourth day an unexpected event threw out his

calculations.  Summoned to town by the arrival in England of

her husband's mother, she left without giving Darrow the

chance he had counted on, and he cursed himself for a

dilatory blunderer.  Still, his disappointment was tempered

by the certainty of being with her again before she left for

France; and they did in fact see each other in London.

There, however, the atmosphere had changed with the

conditions.  He could not say that she avoided him, or even

that she was a shade less glad to see him; but she was beset

by family duties and, as he thought, a little too readily

resigned to them.



The Marquise de Chantelle, as Darrow soon perceived, had the

same mild formidableness as the late Mr. Leath: a sort of

insistent self-effacement before which every one about her

gave way.  It was perhaps the shadow of this lady's

presence--pervasive even during her actual brief eclipses--

that subdued and silenced Mrs. Leath. The latter was,

moreover, preoccupied about her stepson, who, soon after

receiving his degree at Harvard, had been rescued from a

stormy love-affair, and finally, after some months of

troubled drifting, had yielded to his step-mother's counsel

and gone up to Oxford for a year of supplementary study.

Thither Mrs. Leath went once or twice to visit him, and her

remaining days were packed with family obligations: getting,

as she phrased it, "frocks and governesses" for her little

girl, who had been left in France, and having to devote the

remaining hours to long shopping expeditions with her

mother-in-law.  Nevertheless, during her brief escapes from

duty, Darrow had had time to feel her safe in the custody of

his devotion, set apart for some inevitable hour; and the

last evening, at the theatre, between the overshadowing

Marquise and the unsuspicious Owen, they had had an almost

decisive exchange of words.



Now, in the rattle of the wind about his ears, Darrow

continued to hear the mocking echo of her message:

"Unexpected obstacle."  In such an existence as Mrs. Leath's,

at once so ordered and so exposed, he knew how small a

complication might assume the magnitude of an "obstacle;"

yet, even allowing as impartially as his state of mind

permitted for the fact that, with her mother-in-law always,

and her stepson intermittently, under her roof, her lot

involved a hundred small accommodations generally foreign to

the freedom of widowhood--even so, he could not but think

that the very ingenuity bred of such conditions might have

helped her to find a way out of them.  No, her "reason",

whatever it was, could, in this case, be nothing but a

pretext; unless he leaned to the less flattering alternative

that any reason seemed good enough for postponing him!

Certainly, if her welcome had meant what he imagined, she

could not, for the second time within a few weeks, have

submitted so tamely to the disarrangement of their plans; a

disarrangement which--his official duties considered--might,

for all she knew, result in his not being able to go to her

for months.



"Please don't come till thirtieth."  The thirtieth--and it

was now the fifteenth!  She flung back the fortnight on his

hands as if he had been an idler indifferent to dates,

instead of an active young diplomatist who, to respond to

her call, had had to hew his way through a very jungle of

engagements!  "Please don't come till thirtieth."  That was

all.  Not the shadow of an excuse or a regret; not even the

perfunctory "have written" with which it is usual to soften

such blows.  She didn't want him, and had taken the shortest

way to tell him so.  Even in his first moment of

exasperation it struck him as characteristic that she should

not have padded her postponement with a fib.  Certainly her

moral angles were not draped!



"If I asked her to marry me, she'd have refused in the same

language.  But thank heaven I haven't!" he reflected.



These considerations, which had been with him every yard of

the way from London, reached a climax of irony as he was

drawn into the crowd on the pier.  It did not soften his

feelings to remember that, but for her lack of forethought,

he might, at this harsh end of the stormy May day, have been

sitting before his club fire in London instead of shivering

in the damp human herd on the pier.  Admitting the sex's

traditional right to change, she might at least have advised

him of hers by telegraphing directly to his rooms.  But in

spite of their exchange of letters she had apparently failed

to note his address, and a breathless emissary had rushed

from the Embassy to pitch her telegram into his compartment

as the train was moving from the station.



Yes, he had given her chance enough to learn where he lived;

and this minor proof of her indifference became, as he

jammed his way through the crowd, the main point of his

grievance against her and of his derision of himself.  Half

way down the pier the prod of an umbrella increased his

exasperation by rousing him to the fact that it was raining.

Instantly the narrow ledge became a battle-ground of

thrusting, slanting, parrying domes.  The wind rose with the

rain, and the harried wretches exposed to this double

assault wreaked on their neighbours the vengeance they could

not take on the elements.



Darrow, whose healthy enjoyment of life made him in general

a good traveller, tolerant of agglutinated humanity, felt

himself obscurely outraged by these promiscuous contacts.

It was as though all the people about him had taken his

measure and known his plight; as though they were

contemptuously bumping and shoving him like the

inconsiderable thing he had become.  "She doesn't want you,

doesn't want you, doesn't want you," their umbrellas and

their elbows seemed to say.



He had rashly vowed, when the telegram was flung into his

window: "At any rate I won't turn back"--as though it might

cause the sender a malicious joy to have him retrace his

steps rather than keep on to Paris!  Now he perceived the

absurdity of the vow, and thanked his stars that he need not

plunge, to no purpose, into the fury of waves outside the

harbour.



With this thought in his mind he turned back to look for his

porter; but the contiguity of dripping umbrellas made

signalling impossible and, perceiving that he had lost sight

of the man, he scrambled up again to the platform.  As he

reached it, a descending umbrella caught him in the collar-

bone; and the next moment, bent sideways by the wind, it

turned inside out and soared up, kite-wise, at the end of a

helpless female arm.



Darrow caught the umbrella, lowered its inverted ribs, and

looked up at the face it exposed to him.



"Wait a minute," he said; "you can't stay here."



As he spoke, a surge of the crowd drove the owner of the

umbrella abruptly down on him.  Darrow steadied her with

extended arms, and regaining her footing she cried out: "Oh,

dear, oh, dear!  It's in ribbons!"



Her lifted face, fresh and flushed in the driving rain, woke

in him a memory of having seen it at a distant time and in a

vaguely unsympathetic setting; but it was no moment to

follow up such clues, and the face was obviously one to make

its way on its own merits.



Its possessor had dropped her bag and bundles to clutch at

the tattered umbrella.  "I bought it only yesterday at the

Stores; and--yes--it's utterly done for!" she lamented.



Darrow smiled at the intensity of her distress.  It was food

for the moralist that, side by side with such catastrophes

as his, human nature was still agitating itself over its

microscopic woes!



"Here's mine if you want it!" he shouted back at her through

the shouting of the gale.



The offer caused the young lady to look at him more

intently.  "Why, it's Mr. Darrow!" she exclaimed; and then,

all radiant recognition: "Oh, thank you!  We'll share it, if

you will."



She knew him, then; and he knew her; but how and where had

they met?  He put aside the problem for subsequent solution,

and drawing her into a more sheltered corner, bade her wait

till he could find his porter.



When, a few minutes later, he came back with his recovered

property, and the news that the boat would not leave till

the tide had turned, she showed no concern.



"Not for two hours?  How lucky--then I can find my trunk!"



Ordinarily Darrow would have felt little disposed to involve

himself in the adventure of a young female who had lost her

trunk; but at the moment he was glad of any pretext for

activity.  Even should he decide to take the next up train

from Dover he still had a yawning hour to fill; and the

obvious remedy was to devote it to the loveliness in

distress under his umbrella.



"You've lost a trunk?  Let me see if I can find it."



It pleased him that she did not return the conventional "Oh,

WOULD you?" Instead, she corrected him with a laugh--Not

a trunk, but my trunk; I've no other--" and then added

briskly: "You'd better first see to getting your own things

on the boat."



This made him answer, as if to give substance to his plans

by discussing them: "I don't actually know that I'm going

over."



"Not going over?"



"Well...perhaps not by this boat."  Again he felt a stealing

indecision.  "I may probably have to go back to London.

I'm--I'm waiting...expecting a letter...(She'll think me a

defaulter," he reflected.) "But meanwhile there's plenty of

time to find your trunk."



He picked up his companion's bundles, and offered her an arm

which enabled her to press her slight person more closely

under his umbrella; and as, thus linked, they beat their way

back to the platform, pulled together and apart like

marionettes on the wires of the wind, he continued to wonder

where he could have seen her.  He had immediately classed

her as a compatriot; her small nose, her clear tints, a kind

of sketchy delicacy in her face, as though she had been

brightly but lightly washed in with water-colour, all

confirmed the evidence of her high sweet voice and of her

quick incessant gestures.She was clearly an American, but

with the loose native quality strained through a closer woof

of manners: the composite product of an enquiring and

adaptable race.  All this, however, did not help him to fit

a name to her, for just such instances were perpetually

pouring through the London Embassy, and the etched and

angular American was becoming rarer than the fluid type.



More puzzling than the fact of his being unable to identify

her was the persistent sense connecting her with something

uncomfortable and distasteful.  So pleasant a vision as that

gleaming up at him between wet brown hair and wet brown boa

should have evoked only associations as pleasing; but each

effort to fit her image into his past resulted in the same

memories of boredom and a vague discomfort...
