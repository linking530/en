It has happened to you, has it not, to wake in the morning and

wonder for a while where on earth you are? Thus I came half to

life in the caboose, hearing voices, but not the actual words at

first.



But presently, "Hathaway!" said some one more clearly. "Portland

1291!"



This made no special stir in my intelligence, and I drowsed off

again to the pleasant rhythm of the wheels. I he little shock of

stopping next brought me to, somewhat, with the voices still

round me; and when we were again in motion, I heard: "Rosebud!

Portland 1279!" These figures jarred me awake, and I said, "It

was 1291 before," and sat up in my blankets.



The greeting they vouchsafed and the sight of them clustering

expressionless in the caboose brought last evening's

uncomfortable memory back to me. Our next stop revealed how

things were going to-day.



"Forsythe," one of them read on the station. "Portland 1266."



They were counting the lessening distance westward. This was the

undercurrent of war. It broke on me as I procured fresh water at

Forsythe and made some toilet in their stolid presence. We were

drawing nearer the Rawhide station--the point, I mean, where you

left the railway for the new mines. Now Rawhide station lay this

side of Billings. The broad path of desertion would open ready

for their feet when the narrow path to duty and' Sunk Creek was

still some fifty miles more to wait. Here was Trampas's great

strength; he need make no move meanwhile, but lie low for the

immediate temptation to front and waylay them and win his battle

over the deputy foreman. But the Virginian seemed to find nothing

save enjoyment in this sunny September morning, and ate his

breakfast at Forsythe serenely.



That meal done and that station gone, our caboose took up again

its easy trundle by the banks of the Yellowstone. The mutineers

sat for a while digesting in idleness.



"What's your scar?" inquired one at length inspecting casually

the neck of his neighbor.



"Foolishness," the other answered.



"Yourn?"



"Mine."



"Well, I don't know but I prefer to have myself to thank for a

thing," said the first.



"I was displaying myself," continued the second. "One day last

summer it was. We come on a big snake by Torrey Creek corral. The

boys got betting pretty lively that I dassent make my word good

as to dealing with him, so I loped my cayuse full tilt by Mr.

Snake, and swung down and catched him up by the tail from the

ground, and cracked him same as a whip, and snapped his head off.

You've saw it done?" he said to the audience.



The audience nodded wearily.



"But the loose head flew agin me, and the fangs caught. I was

pretty sick for a while."



"It don't pay to be clumsy," said the first man. "If you'd

snapped the snake away from yu' instead of toward yu', its head

would have whirled off into the brush, same as they do with me."



"How like a knife-cut your scar looks!" said I.



"Don't it?" said the snake-snapper. "There's many that gets

fooled by it."



"An antelope knows a snake is his enemy," said another to me.

"Ever seen a buck circling round and round a rattler?"



"I have always wanted to see that," said I, heartily. For this I

knew to be a respectable piece of truth.



"It's worth seeing," the man went on. "After the buck gets close

in, he gives an almighty jump up in the air, and down comes his

four hoofs in a bunch right on top of Mr. Snake. Cuts him all to

hash. Now you tell me how the buck knows that."



Of course I could not tell him. And again we sat in silence for a

while--friendlier silence, I thought.



"A skunk'll kill yu' worse than a snake bite," said another,

presently. "No, I don't mean that way," he added. For I had

smiled. "There is a brown skunk down in Arkansaw. Kind of

prairie-dog brown. Littler than our variety, he is. And he is mad

the whole year round, same as a dog gets. Only the dog has a

spell and dies but this here Arkansaw skunk is mad right along,

and it don't seem to interfere with his business in other

respects. Well, suppose you're camping out, and suppose it's a

hot night, or you're in a hurry, and you've made camp late, or

anyway you haven't got inside any tent, but you have just bedded

down in the open. Skunk comes travelling along and walks on your

blankets. You're warm. He likes that, same as a cat does. And he

tramps with pleasure and comfort, same as a cat. And you move.

You get bit, that's all. And you die of hydrophobia. Ask

anybody."



"Most extraordinary!" said I. "But did you ever see a person die

from this?"



"No, sir. Never happened to. My cousin at Bald Knob did."



"Died?"



"No, sir. Saw a man."



"But how do you know they're not sick skunks?"



"No, sir! They're well skunks. Well as anything. You'll not meet

skunks in any state of the Union more robust than them in

Arkansaw. And thick."



"That's awful true," sighed another. "I have buried hundreds of

dollars' worth of clothes in Arkansaw."



"Why didn't yu' travel in a sponge bag?" inquired Scipio. And

this brought a slight silence.



"Speakin' of bites," spoke up a new man, "how's that?" He held up

his thumb.



"My!" breathed Scipio. "Must have been a lion."



The man wore a wounded look. "I was huntin' owl eggs for a

botanist from Boston," he explained to me.



"Chiropodist, weren't he?" said Scipio. "Or maybe a

sonnabulator?"



"No, honest," protested the man with the thumb; so that I was

sorry for him, and begged him to go on.



"I'll listen to you," I assured him. And I wondered wily this

politeness of mine should throw one or two of them into stifled

mirth. Scipio, on the other hand, gave me a disgusted look and

sat back sullenly for a moment, and then took himself out on the

platform, where the Virginian was lounging.



"The young feller wore knee-pants and ever so thick spectacles

with a half-moon cut in 'em," resumed the narrator, "and he

carried a tin box strung to a strap I took for his lunch till it

flew open on him and a horn toad hustled out. Then I was sure he

was a botanist--or whatever yu' say they're called. Well, he

would have owl eggs--them little prairie-owl that some claim can

turn their head clean around and keep a-watchin' yu', only that's

nonsense. We was ridin' through that prairie-dog town, used to be

on the flat just after yu' crossed the south fork of Powder River

on the Buffalo trail, and I said I'd dig an owl nest out for him

if he was willing to camp till I'd dug it. I wanted to know about

them owls some myself--if they did live with the dogs and snakes,

yu' know," he broke off, appealing to me. "Oh, yes," I told him

eagerly.



"So while the botanist went glarin' around the town with his

glasses to see if he could spot a prairie-dog and an owl usin'

the same hole, I was diggin' in a hole I'd seen an owl run down.

And that's what I got." He held up his thumb again.



"The snake!" I exclaimed.



"Yes, sir. Mr. Rattler was keepin' house that day. Took me right

there. I hauled him out of the hole hangin' to me. Eight

rattles."



"Eight!" said I. "A big one."



"Yes, sir. Thought I was dead. But the woman--"



"The woman?" said I.



"Yes, woman. Didn't I tell yu' the botanist had his wife along?

Well, he did. And she acted better than the man, for he was

rosin' his head, and shoutin' he had no whiskey, and he didn't

guess his knife was sharp enough to amputate my thumb, and none

of us chewed, and the doctor was twenty miles away, and if he had

only remembered to bring his ammonia--well, he was screeching out

'most everything he knew in the world, and without arranging it

any, neither. But she just clawed his pocket and burrowed and

kep' yelling, 'Give him the stone, Augustus!' And she whipped out

one of them Injun medicine-stones,--first one I ever seen,--and

she clapped it on to my thumb, and it started in right away."



"What did it do?" said I.



"Sucked. Like blotting-paper does. Soft and funny it was, and

gray. They get 'em from elks' stomachs, yu' know. And when it had

sucked the poison out of the wound, off it falls of my thumb by

itself! And I thanked the woman for saving my life that capable

and keeping her head that cool. I never knowed how excited she

had been till afterward. She was awful shocked."



"I suppose she started to talk when the danger was over," said I,

with deep silence around me.



"No; she didn't say nothing to me. But when her next child was

born, it had eight rattles."



Din now rose wild in the caboose. They rocked together. The

enthusiast beat his knee tumultuously. And I joined them. Who

could help it? It had been so well conducted from the

imperceptible beginning. Fact and falsehood blended with such

perfect art. And this last, an effect so new made with such

world-old material! I cared nothing that I was the victim, and I

joined them; but ceased, feeling suddenly somehow estranged or

chilled. It was in their laughter. The loudness was too loud. And

I caught the eyes of Trampas fixed upon the Virginian with

exultant malevolence. Scipio's disgusted glance was upon me from

the door.



Dazed by these signs, I went out on the platform to get away from

the noise. There the Virginian said to me: "Cheer up! You'll not

be so easy for 'em that-a-way next season."



He said no more; and with his legs dangled over the railing,

appeared to resume his newspaper.



"What's the matter?" said I to Scipio.



"Oh, I don't mind if he don't," Scipio answered. "Couldn't yu'

see? I tried to head 'em off from yu' all I knew, but yu' just

ran in among 'em yourself. Couldn't yu' see? Kep' hinderin' and

spoilin' me with askin' those urgent questions of yourn--why, I

had to let yu' go your way! Why, that wasn't the ordinary play

with the ordinary tenderfoot they treated you to! You ain't a

common tenderfoot this trip. You're the foreman's friend. They've

hit him through you. That's the way they count it. It's made them

encouraged. Can't yu' see?"



Scipio stated it plainly. And as we ran by the next station,

"Howard!" they harshly yelled. "Portland 1256!"



We had been passing gangs of workmen on the track. And at that

last yell the Virginian rose. "I reckon I'll join the meeting

again," he said. "This filling and repairing looks like the

washout might have been true."



"Washout?" said Scipio.



"Big Horn bridge, they say--four days ago."



"Then I wish it came this side Rawhide station."



"Do yu'?" drawled the Virginian. And smiling at Scipio, he

lounged in through the open door.



"He beats me," said Scipio, shaking his head. "His trail is

turruble hard to anticipate."



We listened.



"Work bein' done on the road, I see," the Virginian was saying,

very friendly and conversational.



"We see it too," said the voice of Trampas.



"Seem to be easin' their grades some."



"Roads do."



"Cheaper to build 'em the way they want 'em at the start, a man

would think," suggested the Virginian, most friendly. "There go

some more I-talians."



"They're Chinese," said Trampas.



"That's so," acknowledged the Virginian, with a laugh.



"What's he monkeyin' at now?" muttered Scipio.



"Without cheap foreigners they couldn't afford all this hyeh new

gradin'," the Southerner continued.



"Grading! Can't you tell when a flood's been eating the banks?"



"Why, yes," said the Virginian, sweet as honey. "But 'ain't yu'

heard of the improvements west of Big Timber, all the way to

Missoula, this season? I'm talkin' about them."



"Oh! Talking about them. Yes, I've heard."



"Good money-savin' scheme, ain't it?" said the Virginian.

"Lettin' a freight run down one hill an' up the next as far as

she'll no without steam, an' shavin' the hill down to that

point." Now this was an honest engineering fact. "Better'n

settin' dudes squintin' through telescopes and cypherin' over one

per cent reductions," the Southerner commented.



"It's common sense," assented Trampas. "Have you heard the new

scheme about the water-tanks?"



"I ain't right certain," said the Southerner.



"I must watch this," said Scipio, "or I shall bust. He went in,

and so did I.



They were all sitting over this discussion of the Northern

Pacific's recent policy as to betterments, as though they were

the board of directors. Pins could have dropped. Only nobody

would have cared to hear a pin.



"They used to put all their tanks at the bottom of their grades,"

said Trampas.



"Why, yu' get the water easier at the bottom."



"You can pump it to the top, though," said Trampas, growing

superior. "And it's cheaper."



"That gets me," said the Virginian, interested.



"Trains after watering can start down hill now and get the

benefit of the gravity. It'll cut down operating expenses a

heap."



"That's cert'nly common sense!" exclaimed the Virginian,

absorbed. "But ain't it kind o' tardy?"



"Live and learn. So they gained speed, too. High speed on half

the coal this season, until the accident."



"Accident!" said the Virginian, instantly.



"Yellowstone Limited. Man fired at engine driver. Train was

flying past that quick the bullet broke every window and killed a

passenger on the back platform. You've been running too much with

aristocrats," finished Trampas, and turned on his heel.



"Haw, hew!" began the enthusiast, but his neighbor gripped him to

silence. This was a triumph too serious for noise. Not a mutineer

moved; and I felt cold.



"Trampas," said the Virginian, "I thought yu'd be afeared to try

it on me."



Trampas whirled round. His hand was at his belt. "Afraid!" he

sneered.



"Shorty!" said Scipio, sternly, and leaping upon that youth, took

his half-drawn pistol from him.



"I'm obliged to yu'," said the Virginian to Scipio. Trampas's

hand left his belt. He threw a slight, easy look at his men, and

keeping his back to the Virginian, walked out on the platform and

sat on the chair where the Virginian had sat so much.



"Don't you comprehend," said the Virginian to Shorty, amiably,

"that this hyeh question has been discussed peaceable by

civilized citizens? Now you sit down and be good, and Mr. Le

Moyne will return your gun when we're across that broken bridge,

if they have got it fixed for heavy trains yet."



"This train will be lighter when it gets to that bridge," spoke

Trampas, out on his chair.



"Why, that's true, too!" said the Virginian. "Maybe none of us

are crossin' that Big Horn bridge now, except me. Funny if yu'

should end by persuadin' me to quit and go to Rawhide myself! But

I reckon I'll not. I reckon I'll worry along to Sunk Creek,

somehow."



"Don't forget I'm cookin' for yu'," said Scipio, gruffy.



"I'm obliged to yu'," said the Southerner.



"You were speaking of a job for me," said Shorty.



"I'm right obliged. But yu' see--I ain't exackly foreman the way

this comes out, and my promises might not bind Judge Henry to pay

salaries.



A push came through the train from forward. We were slowing for

the Rawhide station, and all began to be busy and to talk. "Going

up to the mines to-day?" "Oh, let's grub first." "Guess it's too

late, anyway." And so forth; while they rolled and roped their

bedding, and put on their coats with a good deal of elbow motion,

and otherwise showed off. It was wasted. The Virginian did not

know what vitas going on in the caboose. He was leaning and

looking out ahead, and Scipio's puzzled eye never left him. And

as we halted for the water-tank, the Southerner exclaimed, "They

'ain t got away yet!" as if it were good news to him.



He meant the delayed trains. Four stalled expresses were in front

of us, besides several freights. And two hours more at least

before the bridge would be ready.



Travellers stood and sat about forlorn, near the cars, out in the

sage-brush, anywhere. People in hats and spurs watched them, and

Indian chiefs offered them painted bows and arrows and shiny

horns.



"I reckon them passengers would prefer a laig o' mutton," said

the Virginian to a man loafing near the caboose.



"Bet your life!" said the man. "First lot has been stuck here

four days."



"Plumb starved, ain't they?" inquired the Virginian.



"Bet your life! They've eat up their dining cars and they've eat

up this town."



"Well," said the Virginian, looking at the town, "I expaict the

dining-cyars contained more nourishment."



"Say, you're about right there!" said the man. He walked beside

the caboose as we puffed slowly forward from the water-tank to

our siding. "Fine business here if we'd only been ready," he

continued. "And the Crow agent has let his Indians come over from

the reservation. There has been a little beef brought in, and

game, and fish. And big money in it, bet your life! Them Eastern

passengers has just been robbed. I wisht I had somethin' to

sell!"



"Anything starting for Rawhide this afternoon?" said Trampas, out

of the caboose door.



"Not until morning," said the man. "You going to the mines?" he

resumed to the Virginian.



"Why," answered the Southerner, slowly and casually, and

addressing himself strictly to the man, while Trampas, on his

side, paid obvious inattention, "this hyeh delay, yu' see, may

unsettle our plans some. But it'll be one of two ways,--we're all

goin' to Rawhide, or we're all goin' to Billings. We're all one

party, yu' see."



Trampas laughed audibly inside the door as he rejoined his men.

"I et him keep up appearances," I heard him tell them. "It don't

hurt us what he says to strangers."



"But I'm goin' to eat hearty either way," continued the

Virginian. "And I ain' goin' to be robbed. I've been kind o'

promisin' myself a treat if we stopped hyeh."



"Town's eat clean out," said the man.



"So yu' tell me. But all you folks has forgot one source of

revenue that yu' have right close by, mighty handy. If you have

got a gunny sack, I'll show you how to make some money."



"Bet your life!" said the man.



"Mr. Le Moyne," said the Virginian, "the outfit's cookin' stuff

is aboard, and if you'll get the fire ready, we'll try how

frawgs' laigs go fried." He walked off at once, the man following

like a dog. Inside the caboose rose a gust of laughter.



"Frogs!" muttered Scipio. And then turning a blank face to me,

"Frogs?"



"Colonel Cyrus Jones had them on his bill of fare," I said.

"'FROGS' LEGS A LA DELMONICO.'"



"Shoo! I didn't get up that thing. They had it when I came. Never

looked at it. Frogs?" He went down the steps very slowly, with a

long frown. Reaching the ground, he shook his head. "That man's

trail is surely hard to anticipate," he said. "But I must hurry

up that fire. For his appearance has given me encouragement,"

Scipio concluded, and became brisk. Shorty helped him, and I

brought wood. Trampas and the other people strolled off to the

station, a compact band.



Our little fire was built beside the caboose, so the cooking

things might be easily reached and put back. You would scarcely

think such operations held any interest, even for the hungry,

when there seemed to be nothing to cook. A few sticks blazing

tamely in the dust, a frying-pan, half a tin bucket of lard, some

water, and barren plates and knives and forks, and three silent

men attending to them--that was all. But the travellers came to

see. These waifs drew near us, and stood, a sad, lore, shifting

fringe of audience; four to begin with; and then two wandered

away; and presently one of these came back, finding it worse

elsewhere. "Supper, boys?" said he. "Breakfast," said Scipio,

crossly. And no more of them addressed us. I heard them joylessly

mention Wall Street to each other, and Saratoga; I even heard the

name Bryn Mawr, which is near Philadelphia. But these fragments

of home dropped in the wilderness here in Montana beside a

freight caboose were of no interest to me now.



"Looks like frogs down there, too," said Scipio. "See them marshy

slogs full of weeds?" We took a little turn and had a sight of

the Virginian quite active among the ponds. "Hush! I'm getting

some thoughts," continued Scipio. "He wasn't sorry enough. Don't

interrupt me."



"I'm not," said I.



"No. But I'd 'most caught a-hold." And Scipio muttered to himself

again, "He wasn't sorry enough." Presently he swore loud and

brilliantly. "Tell yu'!" he cried. "What did he say to Trampas

after that play they exchanged over railroad improvements and

Trampas put the josh on him? Didn't he say, ' Trampas, I thought

you'd be afraid to do it?' Well, sir, Trampas had better have

been afraid. And that's what he meant. There's where he was

bringin' it to Trampas made an awful bad play then. You wait.

Glory, but he's a knowin' man! Course he wasn't sorry. I guess he

had the hardest kind of work to look as sorry as he did. You

wait."



"Wait? What for? Go on, man! What for?"



"I don't know! I don't know! Whatever hand he's been holdin' up,

this is the show-down. He's played for a show-down here before

the caboose gets off the bridge. Come back to the fire, or

Shorty'll be leavin' it go out. Grow happy some, Shorty!" he

cried on arriving, and his hand cracked on Shorty's shoulder.

"Supper's in sight, Shorty. Food for reflection."



"None for the stomach?" asked the passenger who had spoken once

before.



"We're figuring on that too," said Scipio. His crossness had

melted entirely away.



"Why, they're cow-boys!" exclaimed another passenger; and he

moved nearer.



From the station Trampas now came back, his herd following him

less compactly. They had found famine, and no hope of supplies

until the next train from the East. This was no fault of

Trampas's; but they were following him less compactly. They

carried one piece of cheese, the size of a fist, the weight of a

brick, the hue of a corpse. And the passengers, seeing it,

exclaimed, "There's Old Faithful again!" and took off their hats.



"You gentlemen met that cheese before, then?" said Scipio,

delighted.



"It's been offered me three times a day for four days," said the

passenger. "Did he want a dollar or a dollar and a half?"



"Two dollars!" blurted out the enthusiast. And all of us save

Trampas fell into fits of imbecile laughter.



"Here comes our grub, anyway," said Scipio, looking off toward

the marshes. And his hilarity sobered away in a moment.



"Well, the train will be in soon," stated Trampas. "I guess we'll

get a decent supper without frogs."



All interest settled now upon the Virginian. He was coming with

his man and his gunny sack, and the gunny sack hung from his

shoulder heavily, as a full sack should. He took no notice of the

gathering, but sat down and partly emptied the sack. "There,"

said he, very businesslike, to his assistant, "that's all we'll

want. I think you'll find a ready market for the balance."



"Well, my gracious!" said the enthusiast. "What fool eats a

frog?"



"Oh, I'm fool enough for a tadpole!" cried the passenger. And

they began to take out their pocket-books.



"You can cook yours right hyeh, gentlemen," said the Virginian,

with his slow Southern courtesy. "The dining-cyars don't look

like they were fired up."



"How much will you sell a couple for?" inquired the enthusiast.



The Virginian looked at him with friendly surprise. "Why, help

yourself! We're all together yet awhile. Help yourselves," he

repeated, to Trampas and his followers. These hung back a moment,

then, with a slinking motion, set the cheese upon the earth and

came forward nearer the fire to receive some supper.



"It won't scarcely be Delmonico style," said the Virginian to the

passengers, "nor yet Saynt Augustine." He meant the great

Augustin, the traditional chef of Philadelphia, whose history I

had sketched for him at Colonel Cyrus Jones's eating palace.



Scipio now officiated. His frying-pan was busy, and prosperous

odors rose from it.



"Run for a bucket of fresh water, Shorty," the Virginian

continued, beginning his meal. "Colonel, yu' cook pretty near

good. If yu' had sold 'em as advertised, yu'd have cert'nly made

a name."



Several were now eating with satisfaction, but not Scipio. It was

all that he could do to cook straight. The whole man seemed to

glisten. His eye was shut to a slit once more, while the innocent

passengers thankfully swallowed.



"Now, you see, you have made some money," began the Virginian to

the native who had helped him get the frogs.



"Bet your life!" exclaimed the man. "Divvy, won't you?" And he

held out half his gains.



"Keep 'em," returned the Southerner. "I reckon we're square. But

I expaict they'll not equal Delmonico's, seh?" he said to a

passenger.



"Don't trust the judgment of a man as hungry as I am!" exclaimed

the traveller, with a laugh. And he turned to his

fellow-travellers. "Did you ever enjoy supper at Delmonico's more

than this?"



"Never!" they sighed.



"Why, look here," said the traveller, "what fools the people of

this town are! Here we've been all these starving days, and you

come and get ahead of them!"



"That's right easy explained," said the Virginian. "I've been

where there was big money in frawgs, and they 'ain't been.

They're all cattle hyeh. Talk cattle, think cattle, and they're

bankrupt in consequence. Fallen through. Ain't that so?" he

inquired of the native.



"That's about the way," said the man.



"It's mighty hard to do what your neighbors ain't doin'," pursued

the Virginian. "Montana is all cattle, an' these folks must be

cattle, an' never notice the country right hyeh is too small for

a range, an' swampy, anyway, an' just waitin' to be a frawg

ranch."



At this, all wore a face of careful reserve.



"I'm not claimin' to be smarter than you folks hyeh," said the

Virginian, deprecatingly, to his assistant. "But travellin'

learns a man many customs. You wouldn't do the business they done

at Tulare, California, north side o' the lake. They cert'nly

utilized them hopeless swamps splendid. Of course they put up big

capital and went into it scientific, gettin' advice from the

government Fish Commission, an' such like knowledge. Yu' see,

they had big markets for their frawgs,--San Francisco, Los

Angeles, and clear to New York afteh the Southern Pacific was

through. But up hyeh yu' could sell to passengers every day like

yu' done this one day. They would get to know yu' along the line.

Competing swamps are scarce. The dining-cyars would take your

frawgs, and yu' would have the Yellowstone Park for four months

in the year. Them hotels are anxious to please, an' they would

buy off yu' what their Eastern patrons esteem as fine-eatin'. And

you folks would be sellin' something instead o' nothin'."



"That's a practical idea," said a traveller. "And little cost."



"And little cost," said the Virginian.



"Would Eastern people eat frogs?" inquired the man.



"Look at us!" said the traveller.



"Delmonico doesn't give yu' such a treat!" said the Virginian.



"Not exactly!" the traveller exclaimed.



"How much would be paid for frogs?" said Trampas to him. And I

saw Scipio bend closer to his cooking.



"Oh, I don't know," said the traveller. "We've paid pretty well,

you see."



"You're late for Tulare, Trampas," said the Virginian.



"I was not thinking of Tulare," Trampas retorted. Scipio's nose

was in the frying-pan.



"Mos' comical spot you ever struck!" said the Virginian, looking

round upon the whole company. He allowed himself a broad smile of

retrospect. "To hear 'em talk frawgs at Tulare! Same as other

folks talks hawsses or steers or whatever they're raising to

sell. Yu'd fall into it yourselves if yu' started the business.

Anything a man's bread and butter depends on, he's going to be

earnest about. Don't care if it is a frawg."



"That's so," said the native. "And it paid good?"



"The only money in the county was right there," answered the

Virginian. "It was a dead county, and only frawgs was movin'. But

that business was a-fannin' to beat four of a kind. It made yu'

feel strange at first, as I said. For all the men had been

cattle-men at one time or another. Till yu' got accustomed, it

would give 'most anybody a shock to hear 'em speak about herdin'

the bulls in a pasture by themselves." The Virginian allowed

himself another smile, but became serious again. "That was their

policy," he explained. "Except at certain times o' year they kept

the bulls separate. The Fish Commission told 'em they'd better,

and it cert'nly worked mighty well. It or something did--for,

gentlemen, hush! but there was millions. You'd have said all the

frawgs in the world had taken charge at Tulare. And the money

rolled in! Gentlemen, hush! 'twas a gold mine for the owners.

Forty per cent they netted some years. And they paid generous

wages. For they could sell to all them French restaurants in San

Francisco, yu' see. And there was the Cliff House. And the Palace

Hotel made it a specialty. And the officers took frawgs at the

Presidio, an' Angel Island, an' Alcatraz, an' Benicia. Los

Angeles was beginnin' its boom. The corner-lot sharps wanted

something by way of varnish. An' so they dazzled Eastern

investors with advertisin' Tulare frawgs clear to New Orleans an'

New York. 'Twas only in Sacramento frawgs was dull. I expaict the

California legislature was too or'n'ry for them fine-raised

luxuries. They tell of one of them senators that he raked a

million out of Los Angeles real estate, and started in for a

bang-up meal with champagne. Wanted to scatter his new gold thick

an' quick. But he got astray among all the fancy dishes, an' just

yelled right out before the ladies, 'Damn it! bring me forty

dollars' worth of ham and aiggs.' He was a funny senator, now."



The Virginian paused, and finished eating a leg. And then with

diabolic art he made a feint at wandering to new fields of

anecdote. "Talkin' of senators," he resumed, "Senator Wise--"



"How much did you say wages were at Tulare?" inquired one of the

Trampas faction.



"How much? Why, I never knew what the foreman got. The regular

hands got a hundred. Senator Wise--"



"A hundred a MONTH?"



"Why, it was wet an' muddy work, yu' see. A man risked rheumatism

some. He risked it a good deal. Well, I was going to tell about

Senator Wise. When Senator Wise was speaking of his visit to

Alaska--"



"Forty per cent, was it?" said Trampas.



"Oh, I must call my wife'" said the traveller behind me. "This is

what I came West for." And he hurried away.



"Not forty per cent the bad years," replied the Virginian. "The

frawgs had enemies, same as cattle. I remember when a pelican got

in the spring pasture, and the herd broke through the fence--"



"Fence?" said a passenger.



"Ditch, seh, and wire net. Every pasture was a square swamp with

a ditch around, and a wire net. Yu've heard the mournful,

mixed-up sound a big bunch of cattle will make? Well, seh, as yu'

druv from the railroad to the Tulare frawg ranch yu' could hear

'em a mile. Springtime they'd sing like girls in the organ loft,

and by August they were about ready to hire out for bass. And all

was fit to be soloists, if I'm a judge. But in a bad year it

might only be twenty per cent. The pelican rushed 'em from the

pasture right into the San Joaquin River, which was close by the

property. The big balance of the herd stampeded, and though of

course they came out on the banks again, the news had went

around, and folks below at Hemlen eat most of 'em just to spite

the company. Yu' see, a frawg in a river is more hopeless than

any maverick loose on the range. And they never struck any plan

to brand their stock and Prove ownership."



"Well, twenty per cent is good enough for me," said Trampas, "if

Rawhide don't suit me."



"A hundred a month!" said the enthusiast. And busy calculations

began to arise among them.



"It went to fifty per cent," pursued the Virginian, "when New

York and Philadelphia got to biddin' agaynst each other. Both

cities had signs all over 'em claiming to furnish the Tulare

frawg. And both had 'em all right. And same as cattle trains,

yu'd see frawg trains tearing acrosst Arizona--big glass tanks

with wire over 'em--through to New York, an' the frawgs starin'

out."



"Why, George," whispered a woman's voice behind me, "he's merely

deceiving them! He's merely making that stuff up out of his

head."



"Yes, my dear, that's merely what he's doing."



"Well, I don't see why you imagined I should care for this. I

think I'll go back."



"Better see it out, Daisy. This beats the geysers or anything

we're likely to find in the Yellowstone."



"Then I wish we had gone to Bar Harbor as usual," said the lady,

and she returned to her Pullman.



But her husband stayed. Indeed, the male crowd now was a goodly

sight to see, how the men edged close, drawn by a common tie.

Their different kinds of feet told the strength of the

bond--yellow sleeping-car slippers planted miscellaneous and

motionless near a pair of Mexican spurs. All eyes watched the

Virginian and gave him their entire sympathy. Though they could

not know his motive for it, what he was doing had fallen as light

upon them--all except the excited calculators. These were loudly

making their fortunes at both Rawhide and Tulare, drugged by

their satanically aroused hopes of gold, heedless of the slippers

and the spurs. Had a man given any sign to warn them, I think he

would have been lynched. Even the Indian chiefs had come to see

in their show war bonnets and blankets. They naturally understood

nothing of it, yet magnetically knew that the Virginian was the

great man. And they watched him with approval. He sat by the fire

with the frying-pan, looking his daily self--engaging and

saturnine. And now as Trampas declared tickets to California

would be dear and Rawhide had better come first, the Southerner

let loose his heaven-born imagination.



"There's a better reason for Rawhide than tickets, Trampas," said

he. "I said it was too late for Tulare."



"I heard you," said Trampas. "Opinions may differ. You and I

don't think alike on several points.



"Gawd, Trampas!" said the Virginian, "d' yu' reckon I'd be

rotting hyeh on forty dollars if Tulare was like it used to be?

Tulare is broke."



"What broke it? Your leaving?"



"Revenge broke it, and disease," said the Virginian, striking the

frying-pan on his knee, for the frogs were all gone. At those

lurid words their untamed child minds took fire, and they drew

round him again to hear a tale of blood. The crowd seemed to lean

nearer.



But for a short moment it threatened to be spoiled. A passenger

came along, demanding in an important voice, "Where are these

frogs?" He was a prominent New York after-dinner speaker, they

whispered me, and out for a holiday in his private car. Reaching

us and walking to the Virginian, he said cheerily, "How much do

you want for your frogs, my friend?"



"You got a friend hyeh?" said the Virginian. "That's good, for

yu' need care taken of yu'." And the prominent after-dinner

speaker did not further discommode us.



"That's worth my trip," whispered a New York passenger to me.



"Yes, it was a case of revenge," resumed the Virginian, "and

disease. There was a man named Saynt Augustine got run out of

Domingo, which is a Dago island. He come to Philadelphia, an' he

was dead broke. But Saynt Augustine was a live man, an' he saw

Philadelphia was full o' Quakers that dressed plain an' eat

humdrum. So he started cookin' Domingo way for 'em, an' they

caught right ahold. Terrapin, he gave 'em, an' croakeets, an'

he'd use forty chickens to make a broth he called consommay. An'

he got rich, and Philadelphia got well known, an' Delmonico in

New York he got jealous. He was the cook that had the say-so in

New York."



"Was Delmonico one of them I-talians?" inquired a fascinated

mutineer.



"I don't know. But he acted like one. Lorenzo was his front name.

He aimed to cut--"



"Domingo's throat?" breathed the enthusiast. "Aimed to cut away

the trade from Saynt Augustine an' put Philadelphia back where he

thought she belonged. Frawgs was the fashionable rage then. These

foreign cooks set the fashion in eatin', same as foreign

dressmakers do women's clothes. Both cities was catchin' and

swallowin' all the frawgs Tulare could throw at 'em. So he--"



"Lorenzo?" said the enthusiast.



"Yes, Lorenzo Delmonico. He bid a dollar a tank higher. An' Saynt

Augustine raised him fifty cents. An' Lorenzo raised him a dollar

An' Saynt Augustine shoved her up three Lorenzo he didn't expect

Philadelphia would go that high, and he got hot in the collar,

an' flew round his kitchen in New York, an' claimed he'd twist

Saynt Augustine's Domingo tail for him and crack his ossified

system. Lorenzo raised his language to a high temperature, they

say. An' then quite sudden off he starts for Tulare. He buys

tickets over the Santa Fe, and he goes a-fannin' and a-foggin'.

But, gentlemen, hush! The very same day Saynt Augustine he tears

out of Philadelphia. He travelled by the way o' Washington, an'

out he comes a-fannin' an' a-foggin' over the Southern Pacific.

Of course Tulare didn't know nothin' of this. All it knowed was

how the frawg market was on soarin' wings, and it vitas feelin'

like a flight o' rawckets. If only there'd been some

preparation,--a telegram or something,--the disaster would never

have occurred. But Lorenzo and Saynt Augustine was that absorbed

watchin' each other--for, yu' see, the Santa Fe and the Southern

Pacific come together at Mojave, an' the two cooks travelled a

matter of two hundred an' ten miles in the same cyar--they never

thought about a telegram. And when they arruv, breathless, an'

started in to screechin' what they'd give for the monopoly, why,

them unsuspectin' Tulare boys got amused at 'em. I never heard

just all they done, but they had Lorenzo singin' and dancin',

while Saynt Augustine played the fiddle for him. And one of

Lorenzo's heels did get a trifle grazed. Well, them two cooks

quit that ranch without disclosin' their identity, and soon as

they got to a safe distance they swore eternal friendship, in

their excitable foreign way. And they went home over the Union

Pacific, sharing the same stateroom. Their revenge killed frawgs.

The disease--"



"How killed frogs?" demanded Trampas.



"Just killed 'em. Delmonico and Saynt Augustine wiped frawgs off

the slate of fashion. Not a banker in Fifth Avenue'll touch one

now if another banker's around watchin' him. And if ever yu' see

a man that hides his feet an' won't take off his socks in

company, he has worked in then Tulare swamps an' got the disease.

Catch him wadin', and yu'll find he's web-footed. Frawgs are

dead, Trampas, and so are you."



"Rise up, liars, and salute your king!" yelled Scipio. "Oh, I'm

in love with you!" And he threw his arms round the Virginian.



"Let me shake hands with you," said the traveller, who had failed

to interest his wife in these things. "I wish I was going to have

more of your company."



"Thank ye', seh," said the Virginian.



Other passengers greeted him, and the Indian chiefs came, saying,

"How!" because they followed their feelings without

understanding.



"Don't show so humbled, boys," said the deputy foreman to his

most sheepish crew. "These gentlemen from the East have been

enjoying yu' some, I know. But think what a weary wait they have

had hyeh. And you insisted on playing the game with me this way,

yu' see. What outlet did yu' give me? Didn't I have it to do? And

I'll tell yu' one thing for your consolation: when I got to the

middle of the frawgs I 'most believed it myself." And he laughed

out the first laugh I had heard him give.



The enthusiast came up and shook hands. That led off, and the

rest followed, with Trampas at the end. The tide was too strong

for him. He was not a graceful loser; but he got through this,

and the Virginian eased him down by treating him precisely like

the others--apparently. Possibly the supreme--the most

American--moment of all was when word came that the bridge was

open, and the Pullman trains, with noise and triumph, began to

move westward at last. Every one waved farewell to every one,

craning from steps and windows, so that the cars twinkled with

hilarity; and in twenty minutes the whole procession in front had

moved, and our turn came.



"Last chance for Rawhide," said the Virginian.



"Last chance for Sunk Creek," said a reconstructed mutineer, and

all sprang aboard. There was no question who had won his spurs

now.



Our caboose trundled on to Billings along the shingly

cotton-wooded Yellowstone; and as the plains and bluffs and the

distant snow began to grow well known, even to me, we turned to

our baggage that was to come off, since camp would begin in the

morning. Thus I saw the Virginian carefully rewrapping

Kenilworth, that he might bring it to its owner unharmed; and I

said, "Don't you think you could have played poker with Queen

Elizabeth?"



"No; I expaict she'd have beat me," he replied. "She was a lady."



It was at Billings, on this day, that I made those reflections

about equality. For the Virginian had been equal to the occasion:

that is the only kind of equality which I recognize.
