<p> THE WANDERING BAND of trappers was well received at Monterey, the inhabitants
were desirous of retaining them among them, and offered extravagant wages to such
as were acquainted with any mechanic art. When they went into the country, too, they
were kindly treated by the priests at the missions; who are always hospitable to
strangers, whatever may be their rank or religion. They had no lack of provisions; being
permitted to kill as many as they pleased of the vast herds of cattle that graze the
country, on condition, merely, of rendering the hides to the owners. They attended bull-fights and
horseraces; forgot all the purposes of their expedition; squandered away,
freely, the property that did not belong to them; and, in a word, revelled in a perfect
fool's paradise.


<p> What especially delighted them was the equestrian skill of the Californians. The vast
number and the cheapness of the horses in this country makes every one a cavalier.
The Mexicans and halfbreeds of California spend the greater part of their time in the
saddle. They are fearless riders; and their daring feats upon unbroken colts and wild
horses, astonished our trappers; though accustomed to the bold riders of the prairies. 


<p> A Mexican horseman has much resemblance, in many points, to the equestrians of Old
Spain; and especially to the vain-glorious caballero of Andalusia. A Mexican dragoon,
for instance, is represented as arrayed in a round blue jacket, with red cuffs and collar;
blue velvet breeches, unbuttoned at the knees to show his white stockings; bottinas of
deer skin; a round-crowned Andalusian hat, and his hair cued. On the pommel of his
saddle, he carries balanced a long musket, with fox skin round the lock. He is cased in
a cuirass of double-fold deer skin, and carries a bull's hide shield; he is forked in a
Moorish saddle, high before and behind; his feet are thrust into wooden box stirrups, of
Moorish fashion, and a tremendous pair of iron spurs, fastened by chains, jingle at his
heels. Thus equipped, and suitably mounted, he considers himself the glory of
California, and the terror of the universe. 


<p> The Californian horsemen seldom ride out without the laso [sic]; that is to say, a long
coil of cord, with a slip noose; with which they are expert, almost to a miracle. The laso,
now almost entirely confined to Spanish America, is said to be of great antiquity; and to
have come, originally, from the East. It was used, we are told, by a pastoral people of
Persian descent; of whom eight thousand accompanied the army of Xerxes. By the
Spanish Americans, it is used for a variety of purposes; and among others, for hauling
wood. Without dismounting, they cast the noose around a log, and thus drag it to their
houses. The vaqueros, or Indian cattle drivers, have also learned the use of the laso
from the Spaniards; and employ it to catch the half-wild cattle by throwing it round their
horns. 


<p> The laso is also of great use in furnishing the public with a favorite, though barbarous
sport; the combat between a bear and a wild bull. For this purpose, three or four
horsemen sally forth to some wood, frequented by bears, and, depositing the carcass of
a bullock, hide themselves in the vicinity. The bears are soon attracted by the bait. As
soon as one, fit for their purpose, makes his appearance, they run out, and with the
laso, dexterously noose him by either leg. After dragging him at full speed until he is
fatigued, they secure him more effectually; and tying him on the carcass of the bullock,
draw him in triumph to the scene of action. By this time, he is exasperated to such
frenzy, that they are sometimes obliged to throw cold water on him, to moderate his
fury; and dangerous would it be, for horse and rider, were he, while in this paroxysm, to
break his bonds. 


<p> A wild bull, of the fiercest kind, which has been caught and exasperated in the same
manner, is now produced; and both animals are turned loose in the arena of a small
amphitheatre. The mortal fight begins instantly; and always, at first, to the disadvantage
of Bruin; fatigued, as he is, by his previous rough riding. Roused, at length, by the
repeated goring of the bull, he seizes his muzzle with his sharp claws, and clinging to
this most sensitive part, causes him to bellow with rage and agony. In his heat and fury,
the bull lolls out his tongue; this is instantly clutched by the bear; with a desperate effort
he overturns his huge antagonist; and then dispatches him without difficulty. 


<p> Beside this diversion, the travellers were likewise regaled with bull-fights, in the genuine
style of Old Spain; the Californians being considered the best bull-fighters in the
Mexican dominions. 


<p> After a considerable sojourn at Monterey, spent in these very edifying, but not very
profitable amusements, the leader of this vagabond party set out with his comrades, on
his return journey. Instead of retracing their steps through the mountains, they passed
round their southern extremity, and, crossing a range of low hills, found themselves in
the sandy plains south of Ogden's River; in traversing which, they again suffered,
grievously, for want of water. 


<p> In the course of their journey, they encountered a party of Mexicans in pursuit of a gang
of natives, who had been stealing horses. The savages of this part of California are
represented as extremely poor, and armed only with stone-pointed arrows; it being the
wise policy of the Spaniards not to furnish them with firearms. As they find it difficult,
with their blunt shafts, to kill the wild game of the mountains, they occasionally supply
themselves with food, by entrapping the Spanish horses. Driving them stealthily into
fastnesses and ravines, they slaughter them without difficulty, and dry their flesh for
provisions. Some they carry off to trade with distant tribes; and in this way, the Spanish
horses pass from hand to hand among the Indians, until they even find their way across
the Rocky Mountains. 


<p> The Mexicans are continually on the alert, to intercept these marauders; but the Indians
are apt to outwit them, and force them to make long and wild expeditions in pursuit of
their stolen horses. 


<p> Two of the Mexican party just mentioned joined the band of trappers, and proved
themselves worthy companions. In the course of their journey through the country
frequented by the poor Root Diggers, there seems to have been an emulation between
them, which could inflict the greatest outrages upon the natives. The trappers still
considered them in the light of dangerous foes; and the Mexicans, very probably,
charged them with the sin of horse-stealing; we have no other mode of accounting for
the infamous barbarities of which, according to their own story, they were guilty; hunting
the poor Indians like wild beasts, and killing them without mercy. The Mexicans excelled
at this savage sport; chasing their unfortunate victims at full speed; noosing them round
the neck with their lasos, and then dragging them to death!


<p> Such are the scanty details of this most disgraceful expedition; at least, such are all that
Captain Bonneville had the patience to collect; for he was so deeply grieved by the
failure of his plans, and so indignant at the atrocities related to him, that he turned, with
disgust and horror, from the narrators. Had he exerted a little of the Lynch law of the
wilderness, and hanged those dexterous horsemen in their own lasos, it would but have
been a well-merited and salutary act of retributive justice. The failure of this expedition
was a blow to his pride, and a still greater blow to his purse. The Great Salt Lake still
remained unexplored; at the same time, the means which had been furnished so
liberally to fit out this favorite expedition, had all been squandered at Monterey; and the
peltries, also, which had been collected on the way. He would have but scanty returns,
therefore, to make this year, to his associates in the United States; and there was great
danger of their becoming disheartened, and abandoning the enterprise.
