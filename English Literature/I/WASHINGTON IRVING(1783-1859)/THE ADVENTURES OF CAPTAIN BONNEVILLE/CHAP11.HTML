<p > WHILE Captain Bonneville and his men are sojourning among the Nez Perces, on Salmon
River, we will inquire after the fortunes of those doughty rivals of the Rocky Mountains and
American Fur Companies, who started off for the trapping grounds to the north-northwest.

<p>Fitzpatrick and Bridger, of the former company, as we have already shown, having received
their
supplies, had taken the lead, and hoped to have the first sweep of the hunting grounds.
Vanderburgh
and Dripps, however, the two resident partners of the opposite company, by extraordinary
exertions
were enabled soon to put themselves upon their traces, and pressed forward with such speed as to
overtake them just as they had reached the heart of the beaver country. In fact, being ignorant of
the
best trapping grounds, it was their object to follow on, and profit by the superior knowledge of
the
other party.

<p>Nothing could equal the chagrin of Fitzpatrick and Bridger at being dogged by their
inexperienced
rivals, especially after their offer to divide the country with them. They tried in every way to
blind
and baffle them; to steal a march upon them, or lead them on a wrong scent; but all in vain.
Vanderburgh made up by activity and intelligence for his ignorance of the country; was always
wary,
always on the alert; discovered every movement of his rivals, however secret and was not to be
eluded or misled.

<p>Fitzpatrick and his colleague now lost all patience; since the others persisted in following
them, they
determined to give them an unprofitable chase, and to sacrifice the hunting season rather than
share
the products with their rivals. They accordingly took up their line of march down the course of
the
Missouri, keeping the main Blackfoot trail, and tramping doggedly forward, without stopping to
set
a single trap. The others beat the hoof after them for some time, but by degrees began to perceive
that they were on a wild-goose chase, and getting into a country perfectly barren to the trapper.
They
now came to a halt, and be-thought themselves how to make up for lost time, and improve the
remainder of the season. It was thought best to divide their forces and try different trapping
grounds.
While Dripps went in one direction, Vanderburgh, with about fifty men, proceeded in another.
The
latter, in his headlong march had got into the very heart of the Blackfoot country, yet seems to
have
been unconscious of his danger. As his scouts were out one day, they came upon the traces of a
recent band of savages. There were the deserted fires still smoking, surrounded by the carcasses
of
buffaloes just killed. It was evident a party of Blackfeet had been frightened from their hunting
camp, and had retreated, probably to seek reinforcements. The scouts hastened back to the camp,
and
told Vanderburgh what they had seen. He made light of the alarm, and, taking nine men with
him,
galloped off to reconnoitre for himself. He found the deserted hunting camp just as they had
represented it; there lay the carcasses of buffaloes, partly dismembered; there were the
smouldering
fires, still sending up their wreaths of smoke; everything bore traces of recent and hasty retreat;
and
gave reason to believe that the savages were still lurking in the neighborhood. With heedless
daring,
Vanderburgh put himself upon their trail, to trace them to their place of concealment: It led him
over
prairies, and through skirts of woodland, until it entered a dark and dangerous ravine.
Vanderburgh
pushed in, without hesitation, followed by his little band. They soon found themselves in a
gloomy
dell, between steep banks overhung with trees, where the profound silence was only broken by
the
tramp of their own horses.

<p>Suddenly the horrid war-whoop burst on their ears, mingled with the sharp report of rifles,
and a
legion of savages sprang from their concealments, yelling, and shaking their buffalo robes to
frighten
the horses. Vanderburgh's horse fell, mortally wounded by the first discharge. In his fall he
pinned
his rider to the ground, who called in vain upon his men to assist in extricating him. One was
shot
down scalped a few paces distant; most of the others were severely wounded, and sought their
safety
in flight. The savages approached to dispatch the unfortunate leader, as he lay struggling beneath
his
horse.. He had still his rifle in his hand and his pistols in his belt. The first savage that advanced
received the contents of the rifle in his breast, and fell dead upon the spot; but before
Vanderburgh
could draw a pistol, a blow from a tomahawk laid him prostrate, and he was dispatched by
repeated
wounds.

<p>Such was the fate of Major Henry Vanderburgh, one of the best and worthiest leaders of the
American Fur Company, who by his manly bearing and dauntless courage is said to have made
himself universally popular among the bold-hearted rovers of the wilderness.

<p>Those of the little band who escaped fled in consternation to the camp, and spread
direful reports of the force and ferocity of the enemy. The party, being without a
head, were in complete confusion and dismay, and made a precipitate retreat, without
attempting to recover the remains of their butchered leader. They made no halt until
they reached the encampment of the Pends Oreilles, or Hanging-ears, where they
offered a reward for the recovery of the body, but without success; it never could be
found.

<p>In the meantime Fitzpatrick and Bridger, of the Rocky Mountain Company, fared but little
better
than their rivals. In their eagerness to mislead them they betrayed themselves into danger, and
got
into a region infested with the Blackfeet. They soon found that foes were on the watch for them;
but
they were experienced in Indian warfare, and not to be surprised at night, nor drawn into an
ambush
in the daytime. As the evening advanced, the horses were all brought in and picketed, and a
guard
was stationed round the camp. At the earliest streak of day one of the leaders would mount his
horse,
and gallop off full speed for about half a mile; then look round for Indian trails, to ascertain
whether
there had been any lurkers round the camp; returning slowly, he would reconnoitre every ravine
and
thicket where there might be an ambush. This done, he would gallop off in an opposite direction
and
repeat the same scrutiny. Finding all things safe, the horses would be turned loose to graze, but
always under the eye of a guard.

<p>A caution equally vigilant was observed in the march, on approaching any defile or
place where an enemy might lie in wait; and scouts were always kept in the advance,
or along the ridges and rising grounds on the flanks.

<p>At length, one day, a large band of Blackfeet appeared in the open field, but in the
vicinity of rocks and cliffs. They kept at a wary distance, but made friendly signs. The
trappers replied in the same way, but likewise kept aloof. A small party of Indians
now advanced, bearing the pipe of peace; they were met by an equal number of white
men, and they formed a group midway between the two bands, where the pipe was
circulated from hand to hand, and smoked with all due ceremony. An instance of
natural affection took place at this pacific meeting. Among the free trappers in the
Rocky Mountain band was a spirited young Mexican named Loretto, who, in the
course of his wanderings, had ransomed a beautiful Blackfoot girl from a band of
Crows by whom she had been captured. He made her his wife, after the Indian style,
and she had followed his fortunes ever since, with the most devoted affection.

<p>Among the Blackfeet warriors who advanced with the calumet of peace she recognized a
brother.
Leaving her infant with Loretto she rushed forward and threw herself upon her brother's neck,
who
clasped his long-lost sister to his heart with a warmth of affection but little compatible with the
reputed stoicism of the savage.

<p>While this scene was taking place, Bridger left the main body of trappers and rode slowly
toward
the group of smokers, with his rifle resting across the pommel of his saddle. The chief of the
Blackfeet stepped forward to meet him. From some unfortunate feeling of distrust Bridger
cocked
his rifle just as the chief was extending his hand in friendship. The quick ear of the savage caught
the click of the lock; in a twinkling he grasped the barrel, forced the muzzle downward, and the
contents were discharged into the earth at his feet. His next movement was to wrest the weapon
from
the hand of Bridger and fell him with it to the earth. He might have found this no easy task had
not
the unfortunate leader received two arrows in his back during the struggle.

<p>The chief now sprang into the vacant saddle and galloped off to his band. A wild
hurry-skurry scene
ensued; each party took to the banks, the rocks and trees, to gain favorable positions, and an
irregular
firing was kept up on either side, without much effect. The Indian girl had been hurried off by
her
people at the outbreak of the affray. She would have returned, through the dangers of the fight, to
her husband and her child, but was prevented by her brother. The young Mexican saw her
struggles
and her agony, and heard her piercing cries. With a generous impulse he caught up the child in
his
arms, rushed forward, regardless of Indian shaft or rifle, and placed it in safety upon her bosom.
Even the savage heart of the Blackfoot chief was reached by this noble deed. He pronounced
Loretto
a madman for his temerity, but bade him depart in peace. The young Mexican hesitated; he urged
to have his wife restored to him, but her brother interfered, and the countenance of the chief grew
dark. The girl, he said, belonged to his tribe-she must remain with her people. Loretto would still
have lingered, but his wife implored him to depart, lest his life should be endangered. It was with
the greatest reluctance that he returned to his companions.

<p>The approach of night put an end to the skirmishing fire of the adverse parties, and the
savages drew
off without renewing their hostilities. We cannot but remark that both in this affair and that of
Pierre's Hole the affray commenced by a hostile act on the part of white men at the moment when
the Indian warrior was extending the hand of amity. In neither instance, as far as circumstances
have
been stated to us by different persons, do we see any reason to suspect the savage chiefs of
perfidy
in their overtures of friendship. They advanced in the confiding way usual among Indians when
they
bear the pipe of peace, and consider themselves sacred from attack. If we violate the sanctity of
this
ceremonial, by any hostile movement on our part, it is we who incur the charge of faithlessness;
and
we doubt not that in both these instances the white men have been considered by the Blackfeet as
the aggressors, and have, in consequence, been held up as men not to be trusted.

<p>A word to conclude the romantic incident of Loretto and his Indian bride. A few months
subsequent
to the event just related, the young Mexican settled his accounts with the Rocky Mountain
Company,
and obtained his discharge. He then left his comrades and set off to rejoin his wife and child
among
her people; and we understand that, at the time we are writing these pages, he resides at a
trading-house established of late by the American Fur Company in the Blackfoot country, where
he acts as
an interpreter, and has his Indian girl with him.
