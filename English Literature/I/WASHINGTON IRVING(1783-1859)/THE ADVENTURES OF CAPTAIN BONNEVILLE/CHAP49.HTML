<p> ON the 22d of June Captain Bonneville raised his camp, and moved to the forks of Wind
River; the
appointed place of rendezvous.  In a few days he was joined there by the brigade of Montero,
which
had been sent, in the preceding year, to beat up the Crow country, and afterward proceed to the
Arkansas.  Montero had followed the early part of his instructions; after trapping upon some of
the
upper streams, he proceeded to Powder River. Here he fell in with the Crow villages or bands,
who
treated him with unusual kindness, and prevailed upon him to take up his winter quarters among
them.

<p> The Crows at that time were struggling almost for existence with their old enemies, the
Blackfeet;
who, in the past year, had picked off the flower of their warriors in various engagements, and
among
the rest, Arapooish, the friend of the white men. That sagacious and magnanimous chief had
beheld,
with grief, the ravages which war was making in his tribe, and that it was declining in force, and
must eventually be destroyed unless some signal blow could be struck to retrieve its fortunes. In
a
pitched battle of the two tribes, he made a speech to his warriors, urging them to set everything at
hazard in one furious charge; which done, he led the way into the thickest of the foe. He was
soon
separated from his men, and fell covered with wounds, but his self-devotion was not in vain. The
Blackfeet were defeated; and from that time the Crows plucked up fresh heart, and were
frequently
successful.

<p> Montero had not been long encamped among them, when he discovered that the Blackfeet
were
hovering about the neighborhood. One day the hunters came galloping into the camp, and
proclaimed that a band of the enemy was at hand. The Crows flew to arms, leaped on their
horses,
and dashed out in squadrons in pursuit. They overtook the retreating enemy in the midst of a
plain.
A desperate fight ensued. The Crows had the advantage of numbers, and of fighting on
horseback.
The greater part of the Blackfeet were slain; the remnant took shelter in a close thicket of
willows,
where the horse could not enter; whence they plied their bows vigorously.

<p> The Crows drew off out of bow-shot, and endeavored, by taunts and bravadoes, to draw the
warriors
Out of their retreat. A few of the best mounted among them rode apart from the rest. One of their
number then advanced alone, with that martial air and equestrian grace for which the tribe is
noted.
When within an arrow's flight of the thicket, he loosened his rein, urged his horse to full speed,
threw
his body on the opposite side, so as to hang by one leg, and present no mark to the foe; in this
way
he swept along in front of the thicket, launching his arrows from under the neck of his steed.
Then
regaining his seat in the saddle, he wheeled round and returned whooping and scoffing to his
companions, who received him with yells of applause.

<p> Another and another horseman repeated this exploit; but the Blackfeet were not to be
taunted out of
their safe shelter. The victors feared to drive desperate men to extremities, so they forbore to
attempt
the thicket. Toward night they gave over the attack, and returned all-glorious with the scalps of
the
slain. Then came on the usual feasts and triumphs, the scalp-dance of warriors round the ghastly
trophies, and all the other fierce revelry of barbarous warfare. When the braves had finished with
the
scalps, they were, as usual, given up to the women and children, and made the objects of new
parades and dances. They were then treasured up as invaluable trophies and decorations by the
braves who had won them.

<p> It is worthy of note, that the scalp of a white man, either through policy or fear, is treated
with more
charity than that of an Indian. The warrior who won it is entitled to his triumph if he demands it.
In
such case, the war party alone dance round the scalp. It is then taken down, and the shagged
frontlet
of a buffalo substituted in its place, and abandoned to the triumph and insults of the million.

<p> To avoid being involved in these guerillas, as well as to escape from the extremely social
intercourse
of the Crows, which began to be oppressive, Montero moved to the distance of several miles
from
their camps, and there formed a winter cantonment of huts. He now maintained a vigilant watch
at
night. Their horses, which were turned loose to graze during the day, under heedful eyes, were
brought in at night, and shut up in strong pens, built of large logs of cotton-wood. The snows,
during
a portion of the winter, were so deep that the poor animals could find but little sustenance. Here
and
there a tuft of grass would peer above the snow; but they were in general driven to browse the
twigs
and tender branches of the trees. When they were turned out in the morning, the first moments of
freedom from the confinement of the pen were spent in frisking and gambolling. This done, they
went soberly and sadly to work, to glean their scanty subsistence for the day. In the meantime the
men stripped the bark of the cotton-wood tree for the evening fodder. As the poor horses would
return toward night, with sluggish and dispirited air, the moment they saw their owners
approaching
them with blankets filled with cotton-wood bark, their whole demeanor underwent a change. A
universal neighing and capering took place; they would rush forward, smell to the blankets, paw
the
earth, snort, whinny and prance round with head and tail erect, until the blankets were opened,
and
the welcome provender spread before them. These evidences of intelligence and gladness were
frequently recounted by the trappers as proving the sagacity of the animal.

<p> These veteran rovers of the mountains look upon their horses as in some respects gifted with
almost
human intellect. An old and experienced trapper, when mounting guard upon the camp in dark
nights
and times of peril, gives heedful attention to all the sounds and signs of the horses. No enemy
enters
nor approaches the camp without attracting their notice, and their movements not only give a
vague
alarm, but it is said, will even indicate to the knowing trapper the very quarter whence the danger
threatens.

<p> In the daytime, too, while a hunter is engaged on the prairie, cutting up the deer or buffalo
he has
slain, he depends upon his faithful horse as a sentinel. The sagacious animal sees and smells all
round him, and by his starting and whinnying, gives notice of the approach of strangers. There
seems
to be a dumb communion and fellowship, a sort of fraternal sympathy between the hunter and his
horse. They mutually rely upon each other for company and protection; and nothing is more
difficult,
it is said, than to surprise an experienced hunter on the prairie while his old and favorite steed is
at
his side.

<p> Montero had not long removed his camp from the vicinity of the Crows, and fixed himself
in his new
quarters, when the Blackfeet marauders discovered his cantonment, and began to haunt the
vicinity,
He kept up a vigilant watch, however, and foiled every attempt of the enemy, who, at length,
seemed
to have given up in despair, and abandoned the neighborhood. The trappers relaxed their
vigilance,
therefore, and one night, after a day of severe labor, no guards were posted, and the whole camp
was
soon asleep. Toward midnight, however, the lightest sleepers were roused by the trampling of
hoofs;
and, giving the alarm, the whole party were immediately on their legs and hastened to the pens.
The
bars were down; but no enemy was to he seen or heard, and the horses being all found hard by, it
was
supposed the bars had been left down through negligence. All were once more asleep, when, in
about
an hour there was a second alarm, and it was discovered that several horses were missing. The
rest
were mounted, and so spirited a pursuit took place, that eighteen of the number carried off were
regained, and but three remained in possession of the enemy. Traps for wolves, had been set
about
the camp the preceding day. In the morning it was discovered that a Blackfoot was entrapped by
one
of them, but had succeeded in dragging it off. His trail was followed for a long distance which he
must have limped alone. At length he appeared to have fallen in with some of his comrades, who
had
relieved him from his painful encumbrance.

<p> These were the leading incidents of Montero's campaign in the Crow country. The united
parties now
celebrated the 4th of July, in rough hunters' style, with hearty conviviality; after which Captain
Bonneville made his final arrangements.  Leaving Montero with a brigade of trappers to open
another campaign, he put himself at the head of the residue of his men, and set off on his return
to
civilized life. We shall not detail his journey along the course of the Nebraska, and so, from point
to point of the wilderness, until he and his band reached the frontier settlements on the 22d of
August.

<p> Here, according to his own account, his cavalcade might have been taken for a procession of
tatterdemalion savages; for the men were ragged almost to nakedness, and had contracted a
wildness
of aspect during three years of wandering in the wilderness. A few hours in a populous town,
however, produced a magical metamorphosis.  Hats of the most ample brim and longest nap;
coats
with buttons that shone like mirrors, and pantaloons of the most ample plenitude, took place of
the
well-worn trapper's equipments; and the happy wearers might be seen strolling about in all
directions, scattering their silver like sailors just from a cruise.

<p> The worthy captain, however, seems by no means to have shared the excitement of his men,
on
finding himself once more in the thronged resorts of civilized life, but, on the contrary, to have
looked back to the wilderness with regret. "Though the prospect," says he, "of once more tasting
the
blessings of peaceful society, and passing days and nights under the calm guardianship of the
laws,
was not without its attractions; yet to those of us whose whole lives had been spent in the stirring
excitement and perpetual watchfulness of adventures in the wilderness, the change was far from
promising an increase of that contentment and inward satisfaction most conducive to happiness. 
He
who, like myself, has roved almost from boyhood among the children of the forest, and over the
unfurrowed plains and rugged heights of the western wastes, will not be startled to learn, that
notwithstanding all the fascinations of the world on this civilized side of the mountains, I would
fain
make my bow to the splendors and gayeties of the metropolis, and plunge again amidst the
hardships
and perils of the wilderness."

<p> We have Only to add that the affairs of the captain have been satisfactorily arranged with the
War
Department, and that he is actually in service at Fort Gibson, on our western frontier, where we
hope
he may meet with further opportunities of indulging his peculiar tastes, and of collecting graphic
and
characteristic details of the great western wilds and their motley inhabitants.

<p>  -- 

<p> We here close our picturings of the Rocky Mountains and their wild inhabitants, and of the
wild life
that prevails there; which we have been anxious to fix on record, because we are aware that this
singular state of things is full of mutation, and must soon undergo great changes, if not entirely
pass
away.  The fur trade itself, which has given life to all this portraiture, is essentially evanescent. 
Rival
parties of trappers soon exhaust the streams, especially when competition renders them heedless
and
wasteful of the beaver. The furbearing animals extinct, a complete change will come over the
scene;
the gay free trapper and his steed, decked out in wild array, and tinkling with bells and trinketry;
the
savage war chief, plumed and painted and ever on the prowl; the traders' cavalcade, winding
through
defiles or over naked plains, with the stealthy war party lurking on its trail; the buffalo chase, the
hunting camp, the mad carouse in the midst of danger, the night attack, the stampede, the
scamper,
the fierce skirmish among rocks and cliffs  --  all this romance of savage life, which yet exists
among
the mountains, will then exist but in frontier story, and seem like the fictions of chivalry or fairy
tale.

<p> Some new system of things, or rather some new modification, will succeed among the
roving people
of this vast wilderness; but just as opposite, perhaps, to the inhabitants of civilization. The great
Chippewyan chain of mountains, and the sandy and volcanic plains which extend on either side,
are
represented as incapable of cultivation. The pasturage which prevails there during a certain
portion
of the year, soon withers under the aridity of the atmosphere, and leaves nothing but dreary
wastes.
An immense belt of rocky mountains and volcanic plains, several hundred miles in width, must
ever
remain an irreclaimable wilderness, intervening between the abodes of civilization, and affording
a last refuge to the Indian. Here roving tribes of hunters, living in tents or lodges, and following
the
migrations of the game, may lead a life of savage independence, where there is nothing to tempt
the
cupidity of the white man. The amalgamation of various tribes, and of white men of every nation,
will in time produce hybrid races like the mountain Tartars of the Caucasus.  Possessed as they
are
of immense droves of horses should they continue their present predatory and warlike habits,
they
may in time become a scourge to the civilized frontiers on either side of the mountains, as they
are
at present a terror to the traveller and trader.

<p> The facts disclosed in the present work clearly manifest the policy of establishing military
posts and
a mounted force to protect our traders in their journeys across the great western wilds, and of
pushing the outposts into the very heart of the singular wilderness we have laid open, so as to
maintain some degree of sway over the country, and to put an end to the kind of "blackmail,"
levied
on all occasions by the savage "chivalry of the mountains."
