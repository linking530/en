<p> IT WAS GRATIFYING to Captain Bonneville, after so long and toilsome a course of
travel, to relieve his poor jaded horses of the burden under which they were almost
ready to give out, and to behold them rolling upon the grass, and taking a long repose
after all their sufferings. Indeed, so exhausted were they, that those employed under
the saddle were no longer capable of hunting for the daily subsistence of the camp. 


<p> All hands now set to work to prepare a winter cantonment. A temporary fortification was
thrown up for the protection of the party; a secure and comfortable pen, into which the
horses could be driven at night; and huts were built for the reception of the
merchandise.


<p> This done, Captain Bonneville made a distribution of his forces: twenty men were to
remain with him in garrison to protect the property; the rest were organized into three
brigades, and sent off in different directions, to subsist themselves by hunting the
buffalo, until the snow should become too deep. 


<p> Indeed, it would have been impossible to provide for the whole party in this
neighborhood. It was at the extreme western limit of the buffalo range, and these
animals had recently been completely hunted out of the neighborhood by the Nez
Perces, so that, although the hunters of the garrison were continually on the alert,
ranging the country round, they brought in scarce game sufficient to keep famine from
the door. Now and then there was a scanty meal of fish or wild-fowl, occasionally an
antelope; but frequently the cravings of hunger had to be appeased with roots, or the
flesh of wolves and muskrats. Rarely could the inmates of the cantonment boast of
having made a full meal, and never of having wherewithal for the morrow. In this way
they starved along until the 8th of October, when they were joined by a party of five
families of Nez Perces, who in some measure reconciled them to the hardships of their
situation by exhibiting a lot still more destitute. A more forlorn set they had never
encountered: they had not a morsel of meat or fish; nor anything to subsist on,
excepting roots, wild rosebuds, the barks of certain plants, and other vegetable
production; neither had they any weapon for hunting or defence, excepting an old
spear: yet the poor fellows made no murmur nor complaint; but seemed accustomed to
their hard fare. If they could not teach the white men their practical stoicism, they at
least made them acquainted with the edible properties of roots and wild rosebuds, and
furnished them a supply from their own store. The necessities of the camp at length
became so urgent that Captain Bonneville determined to dispatch a party to the Horse
Prairie, a plain to the north of his cantonment, to procure a supply of provisions. When
the men were about to depart, he proposed to the Nez Perces that they, or some of
them, should join the hunting-party. To his surprise, they promptly declined. He inquired
the reason for their refusal, seeing that they were in nearly as starving a situation as his
own people. They replied that it was a sacred day with them, and the Great Spirit would
be angry should they devote it to hunting. They offered, however, to accompany the
party if it would delay its departure until the following day; but this the pinching demands
of hunger would not permit, and the detachment proceeded. 


<p> A few days afterward, four of them signified to Captain Bonneville that they were about
to hunt. "What! " exclaimed he, "without guns or arrows; and with only one old spear?
What do you expect to kill? " They smiled among themselves, but made no answer.
Preparatory to the chase, they performed some religious rites, and offered up to the
Great Spirit a few short prayers for safety and success; then, having received the
blessings of their wives, they leaped upon their horses and departed, leaving the whole
party of Christian spectators amazed and rebuked by this lesson of faith and
dependence on a supreme and benevolent Being. "Accustomed," adds Captain
Bonneville, "as I had heretofore been, to find the wretched Indian revelling in blood, and
stained by every vice which can degrade human nature, I could scarcely realize the
scene which I had witnessed. Wonder at such unaffected tenderness and piety, where
it was least to have been sought, contended in all our bosoms with shame and
confusion, at receiving such pure and wholesome instructions from creatures so far
below us in the arts and comforts of life." The simple prayers of the poor Indians were
not unheard. In the course of four or five days they returned, laden with meat. Captain
Bonneville was curious to know how they had attained such success with such scanty
means. They gave him to understand that they had chased the buffalo at full speed,
until they tired them down, when they easily dispatched them with the spear, and made
use of the same weapon to flay the carcasses. To carry through their lessons to their
Christian friends, the poor savages were as charitable as they had been pious, and
generously shared with them the spoils of their hunting, giving them food enough to last
for several days. 


<p> A further and more intimate intercourse with this tribe gave Captain Bonneville still
greater cause to admire their strong devotional feeling. "Simply to call these people
religious," says he, "would convey but a faint idea of the deep hue of piety and devotion
which pervades their whole conduct. Their honesty is immaculate, and their purity of
purpose, and their observance of the rites of their religion, are most uniform and
remarkable. They are, certainly, more like a nation of saints than a horde of savages."


<p> In fact, the antibelligerent policy of this tribe may have sprung from the doctrines of
Christian charity, for it would appear that they had imbibed some notions of the
Christian faith from Catholic missionaries and traders who had been among them. They
even had a rude calendar of the fasts and festivals of the Romish Church, and some
traces of its ceremonials. These have become blended with their own wild rites, and
present a strange medley; civilized and barbarous. On the Sabbath, men, women, and
children array themselves in their best style, and assemble round a pole erected at the
head of the camp. Here they go through a wild fantastic ceremonial; strongly
resembling the religious dance of the Shaking Quakers; but from its enthusiasm, much
more striking and impressive. During the intervals of the ceremony, the principal chiefs,
who officiate as priests, instruct them in their duties, and exhort them to virtue and good
deeds. 


<p> "There is something antique and patriarchal," observes Captain Bonneville, "in this
union of the offices of leader and priest; as there is in many of their customs and
manners, which are all strongly imbued with religion." 


<p> The worthy captain, indeed, appears to have been strongly interested by this gleam of
unlooked for light amidst the darkness of the wilderness. He exerted himself, during his
sojourn among this simple and well-disposed people, to inculcate, as far as he was
able, the gentle and humanizing precepts of the Christian faith, and to make them
acquainted with the leading points of its history; and it speaks highly for the purity and
benignity of his heart, that he derived unmixed happiness from the task. 


<p> "Many a time," says he, "was my little lodge thronged, or rather piled with hearers, for
they lay on the ground, one leaning over the other, until there was no further room, all
listening with greedy ears to the wonders which the Great Spirit had revealed to the
white man. No other subject gave them half the satisfaction, or commanded half the
attention; and but few scenes in my life remain so freshly on my memory, or are so
pleasurably recalled to my contemplation, as these hours of intercourse with a distant
and benighted race in the midst of the desert." 


<p> The only excesses indulged in by this temperate and exemplary people, appear to be
gambling and horseracing. In these they engage with an eagerness that amounts to
infatuation. Knots of gamblers will assemble before one of their lodge fires, early in the
evening, and remain absorbed in the chances and changes of the game until long after
dawn of the following day. As the night advances, they wax warmer and warmer. Bets
increase in amount, one loss only serves to lead to a greater, until in the course of a
single night's gambling, the richest chief may become the poorest varlet in the camp.
