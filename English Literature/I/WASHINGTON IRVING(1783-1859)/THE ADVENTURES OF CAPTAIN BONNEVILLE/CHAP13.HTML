<h1>Washington Irving's<i>The Adventures of Captain Bonneville</i></h1>

<h2>Chapter 13</h2>

<em>Story of Kosato, the Renegade Blackfoot.</em>

</center>
<p>IF the meekness and long-suffering of the Pierced-noses grieved the spirit
of Captain Bonneville,
there was another individual in the camp to whom they were still more annoying. This was a
Blackfoot renegado, named Kosato, a fiery hot-blooded youth who, with a beautiful girl of the
same
tribe, had taken refuge among the Nez  Perces.  Though  adopted  into the tribe, he still retained
the
warlike spirit of his race, and loathed the peaceful, inoffensive habits of those around him. The
hunting of the deer, the elk, and the buffalo, which was the height of their ambition, was too tame
to satisfy his wild and restless nature.  His heart burned for the foray, the ambush, the skirmish,
the
scamper, and all the haps and hazards of roving and predatory warfare.

<p>The recent hoverings of the Blackfeet about the camp, their nightly prowls and daring and
successful
marauds, had kept him in a fever and a flutter, like a hawk in a cage who hears his late
companions
swooping and screaming in wild liberty above him.  The attempt of Captain Bonneville to rouse
the
war spirit of the Nez Perces, and prompt them to retaliation, was ardently seconded by Kosato.
For
several days he was incessantly devising schemes of vengeance, and endeavoring to set on foot
an
expedition that should carry dismay and desolation into the Blackfeet town. All his art was
exerted
to touch upon those springs of human action with which he was most familiar. He drew the
listening
savages round him by his nervous eloquence; taunted them with recitals of past wrongs and
insults;
drew glowing pictures of triumphs and trophies within their reach; recounted tales of daring and
romantic enterprise, of secret marchings, covert lurkings, midnight surprisals, sackings, burnings,
plunderings, scalpings; together with the triumphant return, and the feasting and rejoicing of the
victors. These wild tales were intermingled with the beating of the drum, the yell, the war-whoop
and the war-dance, so inspiring to Indian valor. All, however, were lost upon the peaceful spirits
of
his hearers; not a Nez Perce was to be roused to vengeance, or stimulated to glorious war. In the
bitterness of his heart, the Blackfoot renegade repined at the mishap which had severed him from
a race of congenial spirits, and driven him to take refuge among beings so destitute of martial
fire.

<p>The character and conduct of this man attracted the attention of Captain Bonneville, and he
was
anxious to hear the reason why he had deserted his tribe, and why he looked back upon them
with
such deadly hostility. Kosato told him his own story briefly: it gives a picture of the deep, strong
passions that work in the bosoms of these miscalled stoics.

<p>"You see my wife," said he, "she is good; she is beautiful --I love her.  Yet she has been the
cause
of all my troubles. She was the wife of my chief. I loved her more than he did; and she knew it.
We
talked together; we laughed together; we were always seeking each other's society; but we were
as
innocent as children. The chief grew jealous, and commanded her to speak with me no more. His
heart became hard toward her; his jealousy grew more furious. He beat her without cause and
without mercy; and threatened to kill her outright if she even looked at me. Do you want traces
of
his fury? Look at that scar! His rage against me was no less persecuting. War parties of the
Crows
were hovering round us; our young men had seen their trail. All hearts were roused for action;
my
horses were before my lodge. Suddenly the chief came, took them to his own pickets, and called
them his own. What could I do? he was a chief. I durst not speak, but my heart was burning. I
joined
no longer in the council, the hunt, or the war-feast. What had I to do there? an unhorsed,
degraded
warrior. I kept by myself, and thought of nothing but these wrongs and outrages.

<p>"I was sitting one evening upon a knoll that overlooked the meadow where the horses were
pastured.
I saw the horses that were once mine grazing among those of the chief. This maddened me, and I
sat
brooding for a time over the injuries I had suffered, and the cruelties which she I loved had
endured
for my sake, until my heart swelled and grew sore, and my teeth were clinched. As I looked
down
upon the meadow I saw the chief walking among his horses. I fastened my eyes upon him as a
hawk's; my blood boiled; I drew my breath hard. He went among the willows. In an instant I was
on
my feet; my hand was on my knife --I flew rather than ran -- before he was aware I sprang upon
him, and with two blows laid him dead at my feet. I covered his body with earth, and strewed
bushes
over the place; then I hastened to her I loved, told her what I had done, and urged her to fly with
me.
She only answered me with tears. I reminded her of the wrongs I had suffered, and of the blows
and
stripes she had endured from the deceased; I had done nothing but an act of justice. I again urged
her
to fly; but she only wept the more, and bade me go. My heart was heavy, but my eyes were dry. I
folded my arms. ' 'Tis well,' said I; 'Kosato will go alone to the desert. None will be with him but
the
wild beasts of the desert. The seekers of blood may follow on his trail. They may come upon him
when he sleeps and glut their revenge; but you will be safe. Kosato will go alone.

<p>"I turned away. She sprang after me, and strained me in her arms. 'No,' she cried, 'Kosato
shall not
go alone! Wherever he goes I will go -- he shall never part from me.

<p>"'We hastily took in our hands such things as we most needed, and stealing quietly from the
village,
mounted the first horses we encountered. Speeding day and night, we soon reached this tribe.
They
received us with welcome, and we have dwelt with them in peace. They are good and kind; they
are
honest; but their hearts are the hearts of women.

<p>Such was the story of Kosato, as related by him to Captain Bonneville. It is of a kind that
often
occurs in Indian life; where love elopements from tribe to tribe are as frequent as among the
novel-read heroes and heroines of sentimental civilization, and often give rise to bloods and
lasting feuds.
