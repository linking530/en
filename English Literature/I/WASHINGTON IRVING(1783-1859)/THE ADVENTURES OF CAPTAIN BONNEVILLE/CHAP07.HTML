<p> THE BLACKFEET WARRIORS, when they effected their midnight retreat from their wild
fastness in Pierre's Hole, fell back into the valley of the Seeds-ke-dee, or Green River
where they joined the main body of their band. The whole force amounted to several
hundred fighting men, gloomy and exasperated by their late disaster. They had with
them their wives and children, which incapacitated them from any bold and extensive
enterprise of a warlike nature; but when, in the course of their wanderings they came in
sight of the encampment of Fontenelle, who had moved some distance up Green River
valley in search of the free trappers, they put up tremendous war-cries, and advanced
fiercely as if to attack it. Second thoughts caused them to moderate their fury. They
recollected the severe lesson just received, and could not but remark the strength of
Fontenelle's position; which had been chosen with great judgment. 

<p> A formal talk ensued. The Blackfeet said nothing of the late battle, of which Fontenelle
had as yet received no accounts; the latter, however, knew the hostile and perfidious
nature of these savages, and took care to inform them of the encampment of Captain
Bonneville, that they might know there were more white men in the neighborhood. The
conference ended, Fontenelle sent a Delaware Indian of his party to conduct fifteen of
the Blackfeet to the camp of Captain Bonneville. There was [sic] at that time two Crow
Indians in the captain's camp, who had recently arrived there. They looked with dismay
at this deputation from their implacable enemies, and gave the captain a terrible
character of them, assuring him that the best thing he could possibly do, was to put
those Blackfeet deputies to death on the spot. The captain, however, who had heard
nothing of the conflict at Pierre's Hole, declined all compliance with this sage counsel.
He treated the grim warriors with his usual urbanity. They passed some little time at the
camp; saw, no doubt, that everything was conducted with military skill and vigilance;
and that such an enemy was not to be easily surprised, nor to be molested with
impunity, and then departed, to report all that they had seen to their comrades. 

<p> The two scouts which Captain Bonneville had sent out to seek for the band of free
trappers, expected by Fontenelle, and to invite them to his camp, had been successful
in their search, and on the 12th of August those worthies made their appearance. 

<p> To explain the meaning of the appellation, free trapper, it is necessary to state the
terms on which the men enlist in the service of the fur companies. Some have regular
wages, and are furnished with weapons, horses, traps, and other requisites. These are
under command, and bound to do every duty required of them connected with the
service; such as hunting, trapping, loading and unloading the horses, mounting guard;
and, in short, all the drudgery of the camp. These are the hired trappers. 

<p> The free trappers are a more independent class; and in describing them, we shall do
little more than transcribe the graphic description of them by Captain Bonneville. "They
come and go," says he, "when and where they please; provide their own horses, arms,
and other equipments; trap and trade on their own account, and dispose of their skins
and peltries to the highest bidder. Sometimes, in a dangerous hunting ground, they
attach themselves to the camp of some trader for protection. Here they come under
some restrictions; they have to conform to the ordinary rules for trapping, and to submit
to such restraints, and to take part in such general duties, as are established for the
good order and safety of the camp. In return for this protection, and for their camp
keeping, they are bound to dispose of all the beaver they take, to the trader who
commands the camp, at a certain rate per skin; or, should they prefer seeking a market
elsewhere, they are to make him an allowance, of from thirty to forty dollars for the
whole hunt." 

<p> There is an inferior order, who, either from prudence or poverty, come to these
dangerous hunting grounds without horses or accoutrements, and are furnished by the
traders. These, like the hired trappers, are bound to exert themselves to the utmost in
taking beaver, which, without skinning, they render in at the trader's lodge, where a
stipulated price for each is placed to their credit. These though generally included in the
generic name of free trappers, have the more specific title of skin trappers. 

<p> The wandering whites who mingle for any length of time with the savages have
invariably a proneness to adopt savage habitudes; but none more so than the free
trappers. It is a matter of vanity and ambition with them to discard everything that may
bear the stamp of civilized life, and to adopt the manners, habits, dress, gesture, and
even walk of the Indian. You cannot pay a free trapper a greater compliment, than to
persuade him you have mistaken him for an Indian brave; and, in truth, the counterfeit
is complete. His hair suffered to attain to a great length, is carefully combed out, and
either left to fall carelessly over his shoulders, or plaited neatly and tied up in otter
skins, or parti-colored ribands. A hunting-shirt of ruffled calico of bright dyes, or of
ornamented leather, falls to his knee; below which, curiously fashioned legging,
ornamented with strings, fringes, and a profusion of hawks' bells, reach to a costly pair
of moccasons of the finest Indian fabric, richly embroidered with beads. A blanket of
scarlet, or some other bright color, hangs from his shoulders, and is girt around his
waist with a red sash, in which he bestows his pistols, knife, and the stem of his Indian
pipe; preparations either for peace or war. His gun is lavishly decorated with brass tacks
and vermilion, and provided with a fringed cover, occasionally of buckskin, ornamented
here and there with a feather. His horse, the noble minister to the pride, pleasure, and
profit of the mountaineer, is selected for his speed and spirit, and prancing gait, and
holds a place in his estimation second only to himself. He shares largely of his bounty,
and of his pride and pomp of trapping. He is caparisoned in the most dashing and
fantastic style; the bridles and crupper are weightily embossed with beads and
cockades; and head, mane, and tail, are interwoven with abundance of eagles' plumes,
which flutter in the wind. To complete this grotesque equipment, the proud animal is
bestreaked and bespotted with vermilion, or with white clay, whichever presents the
most glaring contrast to his real color. 

<p> Such is the account given by Captain Bonneville of these rangers of the wilderness, and
their appearance at the camp was strikingly characteristic. They came dashing forward
at full speed, firing their fusees, and yelling in Indian style. Their dark sunburned faces,
and long flowing hair, their legging, flaps, moccasons, and richly-dyed blankets, and
their painted horses gaudily caparisoned, gave them so much the air and appearance
of Indians, that it was difficult to persuade one's self that they were white men, and had
been brought up in civilized life. 

<p> Captain Bonneville, who was delighted with the game look of these cavaliers of the
mountains, welcomed them heartily to his camp, and ordered a free allowance of grog
to regale them, which soon put them in the most braggart spirits. They pronounced the
captain the finest fellow in the world, and his men all <i>bons gar&ccedil;ons</i>, jovial lads,
and swore they would pass the day with them. They did so; and a day it was, of boast, and
swagger, and rodomontade. The prime bullies and braves among the free trappers had
each his circle of novices, from among the captain's band; mere greenhorns, men
unused to Indian life; <i>mangeurs de lard</i>, or pork-eaters; as such new-comers are
superciliously called by the veterans of the wilderness. These he would astonish and
delight by the hour, with prodigious tales of his doings among the Indians; and of the
wonders he had seen, and the wonders he had performed, in his adventurous
peregrinations among the mountains. 

<p> In the evening, the free trappers drew off, and returned to the camp of Fontenelle,
highly delighted with their visit and with their new acquaintances, and promising to
return the following day. They kept their word: day after day their visits were repeated;
they became "hail fellow well met" with Captain Bonneville's men; treat after treat
succeeded, until both parties got most potently convinced, or rather confounded, by
liquor. Now came on confusion and uproar. The free trappers were no longer suffered
to have all the swagger to themselves. The camp bullies and prime trappers of the party
began to ruffle up, and to brag, in turn, of their perils and achievements. Each now tried
to out-boast and out-talk the other; a quarrel ensued as a matter of course, and a
general fight, according to frontier usage. The two factions drew out their forces for a
pitched battle. They fell to work and belabored each other with might and main; kicks
and cuffs and dry blows were as well bestowed as they were well merited, until, having
fought to their hearts' content, and been drubbed into a familiar acquaintance with each
other's prowess and good qualities, they ended the fight by becoming firmer friends
than they could have been rendered by a year's peaceable companionship. 

<p> While Captain Bonneville amused himself by observing the habits and characteristics of
this singular class of men, and indulged them, for the time, in all their vagaries, he
profited by the opportunity to collect from them information concerning the different
parts of the country about which they had been accustomed to range; the characters of
the tribes, and, in short, everything important to his enterprise. He also succeeded in
securing the services of several to guide and aid him in his peregrinations among the
mountains, and to trap for him during the ensuing season. Having strengthened his
party with such valuable recruits, he felt in some measure consoled for the loss of the
Delaware Indians, decoyed from him by Mr Fontenelle.
