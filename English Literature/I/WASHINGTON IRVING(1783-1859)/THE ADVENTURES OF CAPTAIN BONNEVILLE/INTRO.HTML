<h1>Washington Irving's<i>The Adventures of Captain Bonneville</i></h1>

<h2> Introductory Notice</h2>
</center>

WHILE ENGAGED in writing an account of the grand enterprise of Astoria, it was my practice
to seek all kinds of oral information connected with the subject. Nowhere did I pick up more
interesting particulars than at the table of Mr. John Jacob Astor;  who, being the patriarch of
the fur trade in the United States, was accustomed to have at his board various persons of
adventurous turn, some of whom had been engaged in his own great undertaking; others, on
their own account, had made expeditions to the Rocky Mountains and the waters of the
Columbia.


<p>Among these personages, one who peculiarly took my fancy was Captain Bonneville, of the
United States army; who, in a rambling kind of enterprise, had strangely ingrafted the trapper
and hunter upon the soldier. As his expeditions and adventures will form the leading theme of
the following pages, a few biographical particulars concerning him may not be unacceptable.


<p>Captain Bonneville is of French parentage. His father was a worthy old emigrant, who came
to
this country many years since, and took up his abode in New-York. He is represented as a
man not much calculated for the sordid struggle of a money-making world, but possessed of a
happy temperament, a festivity of imagination, and a simplicity of heart, that made him proof
against its rubs and trials. He was an excellent scholar; well acquainted with Latin and Greek,
and fond of the modern classics. His book was his elysium; once immersed in the pages of
Voltaire, Corneille, or Racine, or of his favorite English author, Shakespeare, he forgot the
world and all its concerns. Often would he be seen in summer weather, seated under one of
the trees on the Battery, or the portico of St. Paul's church in Broadway, his bald head
uncovered, his hat lying by his side, his eyes riveted to the page of his book, and his whole
soul so engaged, as to lose all consciousness of the passing throng or the passing hour.


<p>Captain Bonneville, it will be found, inherited something of his father's
<em>bonhommie</em>, and his
excitable imagination; though the latter was somewhat disciplined in early years, by
mathematical studies. He was educated at our national Military Academy at West Point, where
he acquitted himself very creditably; thence, he entered the army, in which he has ever since
continued.


<p>The nature of our military service took him to the frontier, where, for a number of years, he
was
stationed at various posts in the Far West. Here he was brought into frequent intercourse with
Indian traders, mountain trappers, and other pioneers of the wilderness; and became so
excited by their tales of wild scenes and wild adventures, and their accounts of vast and
magnificent regions as yet unexplored, that an expedition to the Rocky Mountains became the
ardent desire of his heart, and an enterprise to explore untrodden tracts, the leading object of
his ambition.


<p>By degrees he shaped his vague day-dream into a practical reality. Having made himself
acquainted with all the requisites for a trading enterprise beyond the mountains, he determined
to undertake it. A leave of absence, and a sanction of his expedition, was obtained from the
major general in chief, on his offering to combine public utility with his private projects, and to
collect statistical information for the War Department concerning the wild countries and wild
tribes he might visit in the course of his journeyings.


<p>Nothing now was wanting to the darling project of the captain, but the ways and means. The
expedition would require an outfit of many thousand dollars; a staggering obstacle to a soldier,
whose capital is seldom any thing more than his sword. Full of that buoyant hope, however,
which belongs to the sanguine temperament, he repaired to New-York, the great focus of
American enterprise, where there are always funds ready for any scheme, however chimerical
or romantic. Here he had the good fortune to meet with a gentleman of high respectability and
influence, who had been his associate in boyhood, and who cherished a schoolfellow
friendship for him. He took a general interest in the scheme of the captain; introduced him to
commercial men of his acquaintance, and in a little while an association was formed, and the
necessary funds were raised to carry the proposed measure into effect. One of the most
efficient persons in this association was Mr. Alfred Seton, who, when quite a youth, had
accompanied one of the expeditions sent out by Mr. Astor to his commercial establishments on
the Columbia, and had distinguished himself by his activity and courage at one of the interior
posts. Mr. Seton was one of the American youths who were at Astoria at the time of its
surrender to the British, and who manifested such grief and indignation at seeing the flag of
their country hauled down. The hope of seeing that flag once more planted on the shores of
the Columbia, may have entered into his motives for engaging in the present enterprise.


<p>Thus backed and provided, Captain Bonneville undertook his expedition into the Far West,
and was soon beyond the Rocky Mountains. Year after year elapsed without his return. The
term of his leave of absence expired, yet no report was made of him at head quarters at
Washington. He was considered virtually dead or lost and his name was stricken from the
army list.


<p>It was in the autumn of 1835 at the country seat of Mr. John Jacob Astor, at Hellgate, that I
first
met with Captain Bonneville He was then just returned from a residence of upwards of three
years among the mountains, and was on his way to report himself at head quarters, in the
hopes of being reinstated in the service. From all that I could learn, his wanderings in the
wilderness though they had gratified his curiosity and his love of adventure had not much
benefited his fortunes. Like Corporal Trim in his campaigns, he had "satisfied the sentiment,"
and that was all. In fact, he was too much of the frank, freehearted soldier, and had inherited
too much of his father's temperament, to make a scheming trapper, or a thrifty bargainer.
There was something in the whole appearance of the captain that prepossessed me in his
favor. He was of the middle size, well made and well set; and a military frock of foreign cut,
that had seen service, gave him a look of compactness. His countenance was frank, open, and
engaging; well browned by the sun, and had something of a French expression. He had a
pleasant black eye, a high forehead, and, while he kept his hat on, the look of a man in the
jocund prime of his days; but the moment his head was uncovered, a bald crown gained him
credit for a few more years than he was really entitled to.


<p>Being extremely curious, at the time, about every thing connected with the Far West, I
addressed numerous questions to him. They drew from him a number of extremely striking
details, which were given with mingled modesty and frankness; and in a gentleness of manner,
and a soft tone of voice, contrasting singularly with the wild and often startling nature of his
themes. It was difficult to conceive the mild, quiet-looking personage before you, the actual
hero of the stirring scenes related.


<p>In the course of three or four months, happening to be at the city of Washington, I again came
upon the captain, who was attending the slow adjustment of his affairs with the War
Department. I found him quartered with a worthy brother in arms, a major in the army. Here he
was writing at a table, covered with maps and papers, in the centre of a large barrack room,
fancifully decorated with Indian arms, and trophies, and war dresses, and the skins of various
wild animals, and hung round with pictures of Indian games and ceremonies, and scenes of
war and hunting. In a word, the captain was beguiling the tediousness of attendance at court,
by an attempt at authorship; and was rewriting and extending his travelling notes, and making
maps of the regions he had explored. As he sat at the table, in this curious apartment, with his
high bald head of somewhat foreign cast, he reminded me of some of those antique pictures
of authors that I have seen in old Spanish volumes.


<p>The result of his labors was a mass of manuscript, which he subsequently put at my disposal,
to fit it for publication and bring it before the world. I found it full of interesting details of life
among the mountains, and of the singular castes and races, both white men and red men,
among whom he had sojourned. It bore, too, throughout, the impress of his character, his
<em>bonhommie</em>, his kindliness of spirit, and his susceptibility to the grand and beautiful.


<p>That manuscript has formed the staple of the following work. I have occasionally interwoven
facts and details, gathered from various sources, especially from the conversations and
journals of some of the captain's contemporaries, who were actors in the scenes he describes.
I have also given it a tone and coloring drawn from my own observation, during an excursion
into the Indian country beyond the bounds of civilization; as I before observed, however, the
work is substantially the narrative of the worthy captain, and many of its most graphic
passages are but little varied from his own language.


<p>I shall conclude this notice by a dedication which he had made of his manuscript to his
hospitable brother in arms, in whose quarters I found him occupied in his literary labors; it is a
dedication which, I believe, possesses the qualities, not always found in complimentary
documents of the kind, of being sincere, and being merited.


<p>To JAMES HARVEY HOOK, Major, U. S. A., 

<br>whose jealousy of its honor, whose anxiety for its interests, and whose sensibility for its
wants,
have endeared him to the service as The Soldier's Friend; 

and whose general amenity, constant cheerfulness. disinterested hospitality, and unwearied
benevolence, entitle him to the still loftier title of The Friend of Man, 

this work is inscribed, etc.
