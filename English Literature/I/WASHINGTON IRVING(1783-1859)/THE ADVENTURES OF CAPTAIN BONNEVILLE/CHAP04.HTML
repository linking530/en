<p> WHEN ON THE MARCH, Captain Bonneville always sent some of his best hunters in
the advance to reconnoitre the country, as well as to look out for game. On the 24th of
May, as the caravan was slowly journeying up the banks of the Nebraska, the hunters
came galloping back, waving their caps, and giving the alarm cry, Indians! Indians! 


<p> The captain immediately ordered a halt: the hunters now came up and announced that
a large war-party of Crow Indians were just above, on the river. The captain knew the
character of these savages; one of the most roving, warlike, crafty, and predatory tribes
of the mountains; horse-stealers of the first order, and easily provoked to acts of
sanguinary violence. Orders were accordingly given to prepare for action, and every
one promptly took the post that had been assigned him in the general order of the
march, in all cases of warlike emergency. 


<p> Everything being put in battle array, the captain took the lead of his little band, and
moved on slowly and warily. In a little while he beheld the Crow warriors emerging from
among the bluffs. There were about sixty of them; fine martial-looking fellows, painted
and arrayed for war, and mounted on horses decked out with all kinds of wild trappings.
They came prancing along in gallant style, with many wild and dexterous evolutions, for
none can surpass them in horsemanship; and their bright colors, and flaunting and
fantastic embellishments, glaring and sparkling in the morning sunshine, gave them
really a striking appearance. 


<p> Their mode of approach, to one not acquainted with the tactics and ceremonies of this
rude chivalry of the wilderness, had an air of direct hostility. They came galloping
forward in a body, as if about to make a furious charge, but, when close at hand,
opened to the right and left, and wheeled in wide circles round the travellers, whooping
and yelling like maniacs. 


<p> This done, their mock fury sank into a calm, and the chief, approaching the captain,
who had remained warily drawn up, though informed of the pacific nature of the
maneuver, extended to him the hand of friendship. The pipe of peace was smoked, and
now all was good fellowship. 


<p> The Crows were in pursuit of a band of Cheyennes, who had attacked their village in
the night and killed one of their people. They had already been five and twenty days on
the track of the marauders, and were determined not to return home until they had
sated their revenge. 


<p> A few days previously, some of their scouts, who were ranging the country at a distance
from the main body, had discovered the party of Captain Bonneville. They had dogged
it for a time in secret, astonished at the long train of wagons and oxen, and especially
struck with the sight of a cow and calf, quietly following the caravan; supposing them to
be some kind of tame buffalo. Having satisfied their curiosity, they carried back to their
chief intelligence of all that they had seen. He had, in consequence, diverged from his
pursuit of vengeance to behold the wonders described to him. "Now that we have met
you," said he to Captain Bonneville, "and have seen these marvels with our own eyes,
our hearts are glad." In fact, nothing could exceed the curiosity evinced by these people
as to the objects before them. Wagons had never been seen by them before, and they
examined them with the greatest minuteness; but the calf was the peculiar object of
their admiration. They watched it with intense interest as it licked the hands accustomed
to feed it, and were struck with the mild expression of its countenance, and its perfect
docility. 


<p> After much sage consultation, they at length determined that it must be the "great
medicine" of the white party; an appellation given by the Indians to anything of
supernatural and mysterious power that is guarded as a talisman. They were
completely thrown out in their conjecture, however, by an offer of the white men to
exchange the calf for a horse; their estimation of the great medicine sank in an instant,
and they declined the bargain. 


<p> At the request of the Crow chieftain the two parties encamped together, and passed the
residue of the day in company. The captain was well pleased with every opportunity to
gain a knowledge of the "unsophisticated sons of nature," who had so long been
objects of his poetic speculations; and indeed this wild, horse-stealing tribe is one of the
most notorious of the mountains. The chief, of course, had his scalps to show and his
battles to recount. The Blackfoot is the hereditary enemy of the Crow, toward whom
hostility is like a cherished principle of religion; for every tribe, besides its casual
antagonists, has some enduring foe with whom there can be no permanent
reconciliation. The Crows and Blackfeet, upon the whole, are enemies worthy of each
other, being rogues and ruffians of the first water. As their predatory excursions extend
over the same regions, they often come in contact with each other, and these casual
conflicts serve to keep their wits awake and their passions alive. 


<p> The present party of Crows, however, evinced nothing of the invidious character for
which they are renowned. During the day and night that they were encamped in
company with the travellers, their conduct was friendly in the extreme. They were, in
fact, quite irksome in their attentions, and had a caressing manner at times quite
importunate. It was not until after separation on the following morning that the captain
and his men ascertained the secret of all this loving-kindness. In the course of their
fraternal caresses, the Crows had contrived to empty the pockets of their white
brothers; to abstract the very buttons from their coats, and, above all, to make free with
their hunting knives. 


<p> By equal altitudes of the sun, taken at this last encampment, Captain Bonneville
ascertained his latitude to be 41&#176; 47' north. The thermometer, at six o'clock in the
morning, stood at fifty-nine degrees; at two o'clock, P. M., at ninety-two degrees; and at
six o'clock in the evening, at seventy degrees. 


<p> The Black Hills, or Mountains, now began to be seen at a distance, printing the horizon
with their rugged and broken outlines; and threatening to oppose a difficult barrier in the
way of the travellers. 


<p> On the 26th of May, the travellers encamped at Laramie's Fork, a clear and beautiful
stream, rising in the west-southwest, maintaining an average width of twenty yards, and
winding through broad meadows abounding in currants and gooseberries, and adorned
with groves and clumps of trees. 


<p> By an observation of Jupiter's satellites, with a Dolland reflecting telescope, Captain
Bonneville ascertained the longitude to be 102&#176; 57' west of Greenwich. 


<p> We will here step ahead of our narrative to observe that about three years after the time
of which we are treating, Mr. Robert Campbell, formerly of the Rocky Mountain Fur
Company, descended the Platte from this fork, in skin canoes, thus proving, what had
always been discredited, that the river was navigable. About the same time, he built a
fort or trading post at Laramie's Fork, which he named Fort William, after his friend and
partner, Mr. William Sublette. Since that time, the Platte has become a highway for the
fur traders. 


<p> For some days past, Captain Bonneville had been made sensible of the great elevation
of country into which he was gradually ascending by the effect of the dryness and
rarefaction of the atmosphere upon his wagons. The wood-work shrunk; the paint
boxes of the wheels were continually working out, and it was necessary to support the
spokes by stout props to prevent their falling asunder. The travellers were now entering
one of those great steppes of the Far West, where the prevalent aridity of the
atmosphere renders the country unfit for cultivation. In these regions there is a fresh
sweet growth of grass in the spring, but it is scanty and short, and parches up in the
course of the summer, so that there is none for the hunters to set fire to in the autumn.
It is a common observation that "above the forks of the Platte the grass does not burn."
All attempts at agriculture and gardening in the neighborhood of Fort William have been
attended with very little success. The grain and vegetables raised there have been
scanty in quantity and poor in quality. The great elevation of these plains, and the
dryness of the atmosphere, will tend to retain these immense regions in a state of
pristine wildness. 


<p> In the course of a day or two more, the travellers entered that wild and broken tract of
the Crow country called the Black Hills, and here their journey became toilsome in the
extreme. Rugged steeps and deep ravines incessantly obstructed their progress, so
that a great part of the day was spent in the painful toil of digging through banks, filling
up ravines, forcing the wagons up the most forbidding ascents, or swinging them with
ropes down the face of dangerous precipices. The shoes of their horses were worn out,
and their feet injured by the rugged and stony roads. The travellers were annoyed also
by frequent but brief storms, which would come hurrying over the hills, or through the
mountain defiles, rage with great fury for a short time, and then pass off, leaving
everything calm and serene again. 


<p> For several nights the camp had been infested by vagabond Indian dogs, prowling
about in quest of food. They were about the size of a large pointer; with ears short and
erect, and a long bushy tail--altogether, they bore a striking resemblance to a wolf.
These skulking visitors would keep about the purlieus of the camp until daylight; when,
on the first stir of life among the sleepers, they would scamper off until they reached
some rising ground, where they would take their seats, and keep a sharp and hungry
watch upon every movement. The moment the travellers were fairly on the march, and
the camp was abandoned, these starving hangers-on would hasten to the deserted
fires, to seize upon the half-picked bones, the offal and garbage that lay about; and,
having made a hasty meal, with many a snap and snarl and growl, would follow
leisurely on the trail of the caravan. Many attempts were made to coax or catch them,
but in vain. Their quick and suspicious eyes caught the slightest sinister movement, and
they turned and scampered off. At length one was taken. He was terribly alarmed, and
crouched and trembled as if expecting instant death. Soothed, however, by caresses,
he began after a time to gather confidence and wag his tail, and at length was brought
to follow close at the heels of his captors, still, however, darting around furtive and
suspicious glances, and evincing a disposition to scamper off upon the least alarm. 


<p> On the first of July the band of Crow warriors again crossed their path. They came in
vaunting and vainglorious style; displaying five Cheyenne scalps, the trophies of their
vengeance. They were now bound homewards, to appease the manes of their comrade
by these proofs that his death had been revenged, and intended to have scalp-dances
and other triumphant rejoicings. Captain Bonneville and his men, however, were by no
means disposed to renew their confiding intimacy with these crafty savages, and above
all, took care to avoid their pilfering caresses. They remarked one precaution of the
Crows with respect to their horses; to protect their hoofs from the sharp and jagged
rocks among which they had to pass, they had covered them with shoes of buffalo hide. 


<p> The route of the travellers lay generally along the course of the Nebraska or Platte, but
occasionally, where steep promontories advanced to the margin of the stream, they
were obliged to make inland circuits. One of these took them through a bold and stern
country, bordered by a range of low mountains, running east and west.  Everything
around bore traces of some fearful convulsion of nature in times long past. Hitherto the
various strata of rock had exhibited a gentle elevation toward the southwest, but here
everything appeared to have been subverted, and thrown out of place. In many places
there were heavy beds of white sandstone resting upon red. Immense strata of rocks
jutted up into crags and cliffs; and sometimes formed perpendicular walls and
overhanging precipices. An air of sterility prevailed over these savage wastes. The
valleys were destitute of herbage, and scantily clothed with a stunted species of
wormwood, generally known among traders and trappers by the name of sage. From an
elevated point of their march through this region, the travellers caught a beautiful view
of the Powder River Mountains away to the north, stretching along the very verge of the
horizon, and seeming, from the snow with which they were mantled, to be a chain of
small white clouds, connecting sky and earth. 


<p> Though the thermometer at mid-day ranged from eighty to ninety, and even sometimes
rose to ninety-three degrees, yet occasional spots of snow were to be seen on the tops
of the low mountains, among which the travellers were journeying; proofs of the great
elevation of the whole region. 


<p> The Nebraska, in its passage through the Black Hills, is confined to a much narrower
channel than that through which it flows n the plains below; but it is deeper and clearer,
and rushes with a stronger current. The scenery, also, is more varied and beautiful.
Sometimes it glides rapidly but smoothly through a picturesque valley, between wooded
banks; then, forcing its way into the bosom of rugged mountains, it rushes impetuously
through narrow defiles, roaring and foaming down rocks and rapids, until it is again
soothed to rest in some peaceful valley. 


<p> On the 12th of July, Captain Bonneville abandoned the main stream of the Nebraska,
which was continually shouldered by rugged promontories, and making a bend to the
southwest, for a couple of days, part of the time over plains of loose sand, encamped
on the 14th on the banks of the Sweet Water, a stream about twenty yards in breadth,
and four or five feet deep, flowing between low banks over a sandy soil, and forming
one of the forks or upper branches of the Nebraska. Up this stream they now shaped
their course for several successive days, tending, generally, to the west. The soil was
light and sandy; the country much diversified. Frequently the plains were studded with
isolated blocks of rock, sometimes in the shape of a half globe, and from three to four
hundred feet high. These singular masses had occasionally a very imposing, and even
sublime appearance, rising from the midst of a savage and lonely landscape. 


<p> As the travellers continued to advance, they became more and more sensible of the
elevation of the country. The hills around were more generally capped with snow. The
men complained of cramps and colics, sore lips and mouths, and violent headaches.
The wood-work of the wagons also shrank so much that it was with difficulty the wheels
were kept from falling to pieces. The country bordering upon the river was frequently
gashed with deep ravines, or traversed by high bluffs, to avoid which, the travellers
were obliged to make wide circuits through the plains. In the course of these, they came
upon immense herds of buffalo, which kept scouring off in the van, like a retreating
army.


<p> Among the motley retainers of the camp was Tom Cain, a raw Irishman, who officiated
as cook, whose various blunders and expedients in his novel situation, and in the wild
scenes and wild kind of life into which he had suddenly been thrown, had made him a
kind of butt or droll of the camp. Tom, however, began to discover an ambition superior
to his station; and the conversation of the hunters, and their stories of their exploits,
inspired him with a desire to elevate himself to the dignity of their order. The buffalo in
such immense droves presented a tempting opportunity for making his first essay. He
rode, in the line of march, all prepared for action: his powder-flask and shot-pouch
knowingly slung at the pommel of his saddle, to be at hand; his rifle balanced on his
shoulder. While in this plight, a troop of Buffalo came trotting by in great alarm. In an
instant, Tom sprang from his horse and gave chase on foot. Finding they were leaving
him behind, he levelled his rifle and pulled [the] trigger. His shot produced no other
effect than to increase the speed of the buffalo, and to frighten his own horse, who took
to his heels, and scampered off with all the ammunition. Tom scampered after him,
hallooing with might and main, and the wild horse and wild Irishman soon disappeared
among the ravines of the prairie. Captain Bonneville, who was at the head of the line,
and had seen the transaction at a distance, detached a party in pursuit of Tom. After a
long interval they returned, leading the frightened horse; but though they had scoured
the country, and looked out and shouted from every height, they had seen nothing of
his rider. 


<p> As Captain Bonneville knew Tom's utter awkwardness and inexperience, and the
dangers of a bewildered Irishman in the midst of a prairie, he halted and encamped at
an early hour, that there might be a regular hunt for him in the morning. 


<p> At early dawn on the following day scouts were sent off in every direction, while the
main body, after breakfast, proceeded slowly on its course. It was not until the middle of
the afternoon that the hunters returned, with honest Tom mounted behind one of them.
They had found him in a complete state of perplexity and amazement. His appearance
caused shouts of merriment in the camp,--but Tom for once could not join in the mirth
raised at his expense: he was completely chapfallen, and apparently cured of the
hunting mania for the rest of his life.
