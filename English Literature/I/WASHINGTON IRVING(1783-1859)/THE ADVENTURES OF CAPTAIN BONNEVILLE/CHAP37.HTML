<p> AFTER THE TWO DAYS of festive indulgence, Captain Bonneville broke up the
encampment, and set out with his motley crew of hired and free trappers, half-breeds,
Indians, and squaws, for the main rendezvous in Bear River valley. Directing his course
up the Blackfoot River, he soon reached the hills among which it takes its rise. Here,
while on the march, he descried from the brow of a hill, a war party of about sixty
Blackfeet, on the plain immediately below him. His situation was perilous; for the
greater part of his people were dispersed in various directions. Still, to betray hesitation
or fear would be to discover his actual weakness, and to invite attack. He assumed,
instantly, therefore, a belligerent tone; ordered the squaws to lead the horses to a small
grove of ashen trees, and unload and tie them; and caused a great bustle to be made
by his scanty handful; the leaders riding hither and thither, and vociferating with all their
might, as if a numerous force was getting under way for an attack. 


<p> To keep up the deception as to his force, he ordered, at night, a number of extra fires to
be made in his camp, and kept up a vigilant watch. His men were all directed to keep
themselves prepared for instant action. In such cases the experienced trapper sleeps in
his clothes, with his rifle beside him, the shot-belt and powder-flask on the stock: so
that, in case of alarm, he can lay his hand upon the whole of his equipment at once,
and start up, completely armed. 


<p> Captain Bonneville was also especially careful to secure the horses, and set a vigilant
guard upon them; for there lies the great object and principal danger of a night attack.
The grand move of the lurking savage is to cause a panic among the horses. In such
cases one horse frightens another, until all are alarmed, and struggle to break loose. In
camps where there are great numbers of Indians, with their horses, a night alarm of the
kind is tremendous. The running of the horses that have broken loose; the snorting,
stamping, and rearing of those which remain fast; the howling of dogs; the yelling of
Indians; the scampering of white men, and red men, with their guns; the overturning of
lodges, and trampling of fires by the horses; the flashes of the fires, lighting up forms of
men and steeds dashing through the gloom, altogether make up one of the wildest
scenes of confusion imaginable. In this way, sometimes, all the horses of a camp
amounting to several hundred will be frightened off in a single night. 


<p> The night passed off without any disturbance; but there was no likelihood that a war
party of Blackfeet, once on the track of a camp where there was a chance for spoils,
would fail to hover round it. The captain, therefore, continued to maintain the most
vigilant precautions; throwing out scouts in the advance, and on every rising ground. 


<p> In the course of the day he arrived at the plain of white clay, already mentioned,
surrounded by the mineral springs, called Beer Springs, by the trappers.  Here the men
all halted to have a regale.  In a few moments every spring had its jovial knot of hard
drinkers, with tin cup in hand, indulging in a mock carouse; quaffing, pledging, toasting,
bandying jokes, singing drinking songs, and uttering peals of laughter, until it seemed
as if their imaginations had given potency to the beverage, and cheated them into a fit
of intoxication. Indeed, in the excitement of the moment, they were loud and
extravagant in their commendations of "the mountain tap"; elevating it above every
beverage produced from hops or malt. It was a singular and fantastic scene; suited to a
region where everything is strange and peculiar:--These groups of trappers, and
hunters, and Indians, with their wild costumes, and wilder countenances; their
boisterous gayety, and reckless air; quaffing, and making merry round these sparkling
fountains; while beside them lay their weep ons, ready to be snatched up for instant
service. Painters are fond of representing banditti at their rude and picturesque
carousels; but here were groups, still more rude and picturesque; and it needed but a
sudden onset of Blackfeet, and a quick transition from a fantastic revel to a furious
melee, to have rendered this picture of a trapper's life complete. 


<p> The beer frolic, however, passed off without any untoward circumstance; and, unlike
most drinking bouts, left neither headache nor heartache behind. Captain Bonneville
now directed his course up along Bear River; amusing himself, occasionally, with
hunting the buffalo, with which the country was covered. Sometimes, when he saw a
huge bull taking his repose in a prairie, he would steal along a ravine, until close upon
him; then rouse him from his meditations with a pebble, and take a shot at him as he
started up. Such is the quickness with which this animal springs upon his legs, that it is
not easy to discover the muscular process by which it is effected. The horse rises first
upon his fore legs; and the domestic cow, upon her hinder limbs; but the buffalo bounds
at once from a couchant to an erect position, with a celerity that baffles the eye. Though
from his bulk, and rolling gait, he does not appear to run with much swiftness; yet, it
takes a stanch horse to overtake him, when at full speed on level ground; and a buffalo
cow is still fleeter in her motion.


<p> Among the Indians and half-breeds of the party, were several admirable horsemen and
bold hunters; who amused themselves with a grotesque kind of buffalo bait. Whenever
they found a huge bull in the plains, they prepared for their teasing and barbarous
sport. Surrounding him on horseback, they would discharge their arrows at him in quick
succession, goading him to make an attack; which, with a dexterous movement of the
horse, they would easily avoid. In this way, they hovered round him, feathering him with
arrows, as he reared and plunged about, until he was bristled all over like a porcupine.
When they perceived in him signs of exhaustion, and he could no longer be provoked to
make battle, they would dismount from their horses, approach him in the rear, and
seizing him by the tail, jerk him from side to side, and drag him backward; until the
frantic animal, gathering fresh strength from fury, would break from them, and rush, with
flashing eyes and a hoarse bellowing, upon any enemy in sight; but in a little while, his
transient excitement at an end, would pitch headlong on the ground, and expire. The
arrows were then plucked forth, the tongue cut out and preserved as a dainty, and the
carcass left a banquet for the wolves.


<p> Pursuing his course up Bear River, Captain Bonneville arrived, on the 13th of June, at
the Little Snake Lake; where he encamped for four or five days, that he might examine
its shores and outlets. The latter, he found extremely muddy, and so surrounded by
swamps and quagmires, that he was obliged to construct canoes of rushes, with which
to explore them. The mouths of all the streams which fall into this lake from the west,
are marshy and inconsiderable; but on the east side, there is a beautiful beach, broken,
occasionally, by high and isolated bluffs, which advance upon the lake, and heighten
the character of the scenery. The water is very shallow, but abounds with trout, and
other small fish.


<p> Having finished his survey of the lake, Captain Bonneville proceeded on his journey,
until on the banks of the Bear River, some distance higher up, he came upon the party
which he had detached a year before, to circumambulate the Great Salt Lake, and
ascertain its extent, and the nature of its shores. They had been encamped here about
twenty days; and were greatly rejoiced at meeting once more with their comrades, from
whom they had so long been separated. The first inquiry of Captain Bonneville was
about the result of their journey, and the information they had procured as to the Great
Salt Lake; the object of his intense curiosity and ambition. The substance of their report
will be found in the following chapter.
