<p> FORT WALLAH - WALLAH is a trading post of the Hudson's Bay Company, situated just
above the mouth of the river by the same name, and on the left bank of the Columbia. It is built
of drift-wood, and calculated merely for defence against any attack of the natives. At the time of
Captain Bonneville's arrival, the whole garrison mustered but six or eight men; and the post was
under the superintendence of Mr. Pambrune, an agent of the Hudson's Bay Company. 


<p> The great post and fort of the company, forming the emporium of its trade on the Pacific, is
Fort
Vancouver; situated on the right bank of the Columbia, about sixty miles from the sea, and just
above the mouth of the Wallamut. To this point, the company removed its establishment from
Astoria, in 1821, after its coalition with the Northwest Company. 


<p> Captain Bonneville and his comrades experienced a polite reception from Mr. Pambrune, the
superintendent: for, however hostile the members of the British Company may be to the
enterprises of American traders, they have always manifested great courtesy and hospitality to
the traders themselves. 


<p> Fort Wallah-Wallah is surrounded by the tribe of the same name, as well as by the Skynses
and
the Nez Perces; who bring to it the furs and peltries collected in their hunting expeditions. The
Wallah-Wallahs are a degenerate, worn-out tribe. The Nez Perces are the most numerous and
tractable of the three tribes just mentioned. Mr. Pambrune informed Captain Bonneville that he
had been at some pains to introduce the Christian religion, in the Roman Catholic form, among
them, where it had evidently taken root; but had become altered and modified, to suit their
peculiar habits of thought, and motives of action; retaining, however, the principal points of
faith, and its entire precepts of morality. The same gentleman had given them a code of laws, to
which they conformed with scrupulous fidelity. Polygamy, which once prevailed among them to
a great extent, was now rarely indulged. All the crimes denounced by the Christian faith met with
severe punishment among them. Even theft, so venial a crime among the Indians, had recently
been punished with hanging, by sentence of a chief. 


<p> There certainly appears to be a peculiar susceptibility of moral and religious improvement
among
this tribe, and they would seem to be one of the very, very few that have benefited in morals and
manners by an intercourse with white men. The parties which visited them about twenty years
previously, in the expedition fitted out by Mr. Astor, complained of their selfishness, their
extortion, and their thievish propensities. The very reverse of those qualities prevailed among
them during the prolonged sojourns of Captain Bonneville. 


<p> The Lower Nez Perces range upon the Way-lee-way, Immahah, Yenghies, and other of the
streams west of the mountains. They hunt the beaver, elk, deer, white bear, and mountain sheep.
Besides the flesh of these animals, they use a number of roots for food; some of which would be
well worth transplanting and cultivating in the Atlantic States. Among these is the camash, a
sweet root, about the form and size of an onion, and said to be really delicious. The cowish, also,
or biscuit root, about the size of a walnut, which they reduce to a very palatable flour; together
with the jackap, aisish, quako, and others; which they cook by steaming them in the ground. 


<p> In August and September, these Indians keep along the rivers, where they catch and dry
great
quantities of salmon; which, while they last, are their principal food. In the winter, they
congregate in villages formed of comfortable huts, or lodges, covered with mats. They are
generally clad in deer skins, or woollens, and extremely well armed. Above all, they are
celebrated for owning great numbers of horses; which they mark, and then suffer to range in
droves in their most fertile plains. These horses are principally of the pony breed; but remarkably
stout and long-winded. They are brought in great numbers to the establishments of the Hudson's
Bay Company, and sold for a mere trifle. 


<p> Such is the account given by Captain Bonneville of the Nez Perces; who, if not viewed by
him
with too partial an eye, are certainly among the gentlest, and least barbarous people of these
remote wildernesses. They invariably signified to him their earnest wish that an American post
might be established among them; and repeatedly declared that they would trade with Americans,
in preference to any other people. 


<p> Captain Bonneville had intended to remain some time in this neighborhood, to form an
acquaintance with the natives, and to collect information, and establish connections that might be
advantageous in the way of trade. The delays, however, which he had experienced on his
journey, obliged him to shorten his sojourn, and to set off as soon as possible, so as to reach the
rendezvous at the Portneuf at the appointed time. He had seen enough to convince him that an
American trade might be carried on with advantage in this quarter; and he determined soon to
return with a stronger party, more completely fitted for the purpose. 


<p> As he stood in need of some supplies for his journey, he applied to purchase them of Mr.
Pambrune; but soon found the difference between being treated as a guest, or as a rival trader.
The worthy superintendent, who had extended to him all the genial rites of hospitality, now
suddenly assumed a withered-up aspect and demeanor, and observed that, however he might feel
disposed to serve him, personally, he felt bound by his duty to the Hudson's Bay Company, to do
nothing which should facilitate or encourage the visits of other traders among the Indians in that
part of the country. He endeavored to dissuade Captain Bonneville from returning through the
Blue Mountains; assuring him it would be extremely difficult and dangerous, if not
impracticable, at this season of the year; and advised him to accompany Mr. Payette, a leader of
the Hudson's Bay Company, who was about to depart with a number of men, by a more
circuitous, but safe route, to carry supplies to the company's agent, resident among the Upper
Nez Perces. Captain Bonneville, however, piqued at his having refused to furnish him with
supplies, and doubting the sincerity of his advice, determined to return by the more direct route
through the mountains; though varying his course, in some respects, from that by which he had
come, in consequence of information gathered among the neighboring Indians.


<p> Accordingly, on the 6th of March, he and his three companions, accompanied by their Nez
Perce
guides, set out on their return. In the early part of their course, they touched again at several of
the Nez Perce villages, where they had experienced such kind treatment on their way down. They
were always welcomed with cordiality; and everything was done to cheer them on their journey. 


<p> On leaving the Way-lee-way village, they were joined by a Nez Perce, whose society was
welcomed on account of the general gratitude and good will they felt for his tribe. He soon
proved a heavy clog upon the little party, being doltish and taciturn, lazy in the extreme, and a
huge feeder. His only proof of intellect was in shrewdly avoiding all labor, and availing himself
of the toil of others. When on the march, he always lagged behind the rest, leaving to them the
task of breaking a way through all difficulties and impediments, and leisurely and lazily jogging
along the track, which they had beaten through the snow. At the evening encampment, when
others were busy gathering fuel, providing for the horses, and cooking the evening repast, this
worthy Sancho of the wilderness would take his seat quietly and cosily by the fire, puffing away
at his pipe, and eyeing in silence, but with wistful intensity of gaze, the savory morsels roasting
for supper. 


<p> When meal-time arrived, however, then came his season of activity. He no longer hung
back, and
waited for others to take the lead, but distinguished himself by a brilliancy of onset, and a
sustained vigor and duration of attack, that completely shamed the efforts of his
competitors--albeit, experienced trenchermen of no mean prowess. Never had they witnessed
such power of mastication, and such marvellous capacity of stomach, as in this native and
uncultivated gastronome. Having, by repeated and prolonged assaults, at length completely
gorged himself, he would wrap himself up and lie with the torpor of an anaconda; slowly
digesting his way on to the next repast. 


<p> The gormandizing powers of this worthy were, at first, matters of surprise and merriment to
the
travellers; but they soon became too serious for a joke, threatening devastation to the fleshpots;
and he was regarded askance, at his meals, as a regular kill-crop, destined to waste the substance
of the party. Nothing but a sense of the obligations they were under to his nation induced them to
bear with such a guest; but he proceeded, speedily, to relieve them from the weight of these
obligations, by eating a receipt in full.
