<p> CONTINUING THEIR JOURNEY UP the course of the Immahah, the travellers found,
as they approached the headwaters, the snow increased in quantity, so as to lie two
feet deep. They were again obliged, therefore, to beat down a path for their horses,
sometimes travelling on the icy surface of the stream. At length they reached the place
where they intended to scale the mountains; and, having broken a pathway to the foot,
were agreeably surprised to find that the wind had drifted the snow from off the side, so
that they attained the summit with but little difficulty. Here they encamped, with the
intention of beating a track through the mountains. A short experiment, however,
obliged them to give up the attempt, the snow lying in vast drifts, often higher than the
horses' heads. 


<p> Captain Bonneville now took the two Indian guides, and set out to reconnoitre the
neighborhood. Observing a high peak which overtopped the rest, he climbed it, and
discovered from the summit a pass about nine miles long, but so heavily piled with
snow, that it seemed impracticable. He now lit a pipe, and, sitting down with the two
guides, proceeded to hold a consultation after the Indian mode. For a long while they all
smoked vigorously and in silence, pondering over the subject matter before them. At
length a discussion commenced, and the opinion in which the two guides concurred
was, that the horses could not possibly cross the snows. They advised, therefore, that
the party should proceed on foot, and they should take the horses back to the village,
where they would be well taken care of until Captain Bonneville should send for them.
They urged this advice with great earnestness; declaring that their chief would be
extremely angry, and treat them severely, should any of the horses of his good friends,
the white men, be lost, in crossing under their guidance; and that, therefore, it was good
they should not attempt it. 


<p> Captain Bonneville sat smoking his pipe, and listening to them with Indian silence and
gravity. When they had finished, he replied to them in their own style of language. 


<p> "My friends," said he, "I have seen the pass, and have listened to your words; you have
little hearts. When troubles and dangers lie in your way, you turn your backs. That is not
the way with my nation. When great obstacles present, and threaten to keep them
back, their hearts swell, and they push forward. They love to conquer difficulties. But
enough for the present. Night is coming on; let us return to our camp." 


<p> He moved on, and they followed in silence. On reaching the camp, he found the men
extremely discouraged. One of their number had been surveying the neighborhood, and
seriously assured them that the snow was at least a hundred feet deep. The captain
cheered them up, and diffused fresh spirit in them by his example. Still he was much
perplexed how to proceed. About dark there was a slight drizzling rain. An expedient
now suggested itself. This was to make two light sleds, place the packs on them, and
drag them to the other side of the mountain, thus forming a road in the wet snow,
which, should it afterward freeze, would be sufficiently hard to bear the horses. This
plan was promptly put into execution; the sleds were constructed, the heavy baggage
was drawn backward and forward until the road was beaten, when they desisted from
their fatiguing labor. The night turned out clear and cold, and by morning, their road was
incrusted with ice sufficiently strong for their purpose. They now set out on their icy
turnpike, and got on well enough, excepting that now and then a horse would sidle out
of the track, and immediately sink up to the neck. Then came on toil and difficulty, and
they would be obliged to haul up the floundering animal with ropes. One, more unlucky
than the rest, after repeated falls, had to be abandoned in the snow. Notwithstanding
these repeated delays, they succeeded, before the sun had acquired sufficient power to
thaw the snow, in getting all the rest of their horses safely to the other side of the
mountain.


<p> Their difficulties and dangers, however, were not yet at an end. They had now to
descend, and the whole surface of the snow was glazed with ice. It was necessary;
therefore, to wait until the warmth of the sun should melt the glassy crust of sleet, and
give them a foothold in the yielding snow. They had a frightful warning of the danger of
any movement while the sleet remained. A wild young mare, in her restlessness,
strayed to the edge of a declivity. One slip was fatal to her; she lost her balance,
careered with headlong velocity down the slippery side of the mountain for more than
two thousand feet, and was dashed to pieces at the bottom. When the travellers
afterward sought the carcass to cut it up for food, they found it torn and mangled in the
most horrible manner. 


<p> It was quite late in the evening before the party descended to the ultimate skirts of the
snow. Here they planted large logs below them to prevent their sliding down, and
encamped for the night. The next day they succeeded in bringing down their baggage
to the encampment; then packing all up regularly, and loading their horses, they once
more set out briskly and cheerfully, and in the course of the following day succeeded in
getting to a grassy region. 


<p> Here their Nez Perce guides declared that all the difficulties of the mountains were at
an end, and their course was plain and simple, and needed no further guidance; they
asked leave, therefore, to return home. This was readily granted, with many thanks and
presents for their faithful services. They took a long farewell smoke with their white
friends, after which they mounted their horses and set off, exchanging many farewells
and kind wishes. 


<p> On the following day, Captain Bonneville completed his journey down the mountain,
and encamped on the borders of Snake River, where he found the grass in great
abundance and eight inches in height. In this neighborhood, he saw on the rocky banks
of the river several prismoids of basaltes, rising to the height of fifty or sixty feet. 


<p> Nothing particularly worthy of note occurred during several days as the party proceeded
up along Snake River and across its tributary streams. After crossing Gun Creek, they
met with various signs that white people were in the neighborhood, and Captain
Bonneville made earnest exertions to discover whether they were any of his own
people, that he might join them. He soon ascertained that they had been starved out of
this tract of country, and had betaken themselves to the buffalo region, whither he now
shaped his course. In proceeding along Snake River, he found small hordes of
Shoshonies lingering upon the minor streams, and living upon trout and other fish,
which they catch in great numbers at this season in fish-traps. The greater part of the
tribe, however, had penetrated the mountains to hunt the elk, deer, and ahsahta or
bighorn. 


<p> On the 12th of May, Captain Bonneville reached the Portneuf River, in the vicinity of
which he had left the winter encampment of his company on the preceding Christmas
day. He had then expected to be back by the beginning of March, but circumstances
had detained him upward of two months beyond the time, and the winter encampment
must long ere this have been broken up. Halting on the banks of the Portneuf, he
dispatched scouts a few miles above, to visit the old camping ground and search for
signals of the party, or of their whereabouts, should they actually have abandoned the
spot. They returned without being able to ascertain anything. 


<p> Being now destitute of provisions, the travellers found it necessary to make a short
hunting excursion after buffalo. They made caches, therefore, on an island in the river,
in which they deposited all their baggage, and then set out on their expedition. They
were so fortunate as to kill a couple of fine bulls, and cutting up the carcasses,
determined to husband this stock of provisions with the most miserly care, lest they
should again be obliged to venture into the open and dangerous hunting grounds.
Returning to their island on the 18th of May, they found that the wolves had been at the
caches, scratched up the contents, and scattered them in every direction. They now
constructed a more secure one, in which they deposited their heaviest articles, and then
descended Snake River again, and encamped just above the American Falls. Here they
proceeded to fortify themselves, intending to remain here, and give their horses an
opportunity to recruit their strength with good pasturage, until it should be time to set out
for the annual rendezvous in Bear River valley.


<p> On the first of June they descried four men on the other side of the river, opposite to the
camp, and, having attracted their attention by a discharge of rifles, ascertained to their
joy that they were some of their own people. From these men Captain Bonneville
learned that the whole party which he had left in the preceding month of December
were encamped on Blackfoot River, a tributary of Snake River, not very far above the
Portneuf. Thither he proceeded with all possible dispatch, and in a little while had the
pleasure of finding himself once more surrounded by his people, who greeted his return
among them in the heartiest manner; for his long-protracted absence had convinced
them that he and his three companions had been cut off by some hostile tribe. 


<p> The party had suffered much during his absence. They had been pinched by famine
and almost starved, and had been forced to repair to the caches at Salmon River. Here
they fell in with the Blackfeet bands, and considered themselves fortunate in being able
to retreat from the dangerous neighborhood without sustaining any loss. 


<p> Being thus reunited, a general treat from Captain Bonneville to his men was a matter of
course. Two days, therefore, were given up to such feasting and merriment as their
means and situation afforded. What was wanting in good cheer was made up in good
will; the free trappers in particular, distinguished themselves on the occasion, and the
saturnalia was enjoyed with a hearty holiday spirit, that smacked of the game flavor of
the wilderness.
