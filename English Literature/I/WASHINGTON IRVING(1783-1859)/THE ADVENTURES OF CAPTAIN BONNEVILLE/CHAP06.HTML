<p> LEAVING CAPTAIN BONNEVILLE and his band ensconced within their fortified camp
in the Green River valley, we shall step back and accompany a party of the Rocky
Mountain Fur Company in its progress, with supplies from St. Louis, to the annual
rendezvous at Pierre's Hole. This party consisted of sixty men, well mounted, and
conducting a line of packhorses. They were commanded by Captain William Sublette, a
partner in the company, and one of the most active, intrepid, and renowned leaders in
this half military kind of service. He was accompanied by his associate in business, and
tried companion in danger, Mr. Robert Campbell, one of the pioneers of the trade
beyond the mountains, who had commanded trapping parties there in times of the
greatest peril.

<p> As these worthy compeers were on their route to the frontier, they fell in with another
expedition, likewise on its way to the mountains. This was a party of regular "down-easters," that
is to say, people of New England, who, with the all-penetrating and all-pervading spirit of their
race, were now pushing their way into a new field of enterprise
with which they were totally unacquainted. The party had been fitted out and was
maintained and commanded by Mr. Nathaniel J. Wyeth, of Boston. This gentleman had
conceived an idea that a profitable fishery for salmon might be established on the
Columbia River, and connected with the fur trade. He had, accordingly, invested capital
in goods, calculated, as he supposed, for the Indian trade, and had enlisted a number
of eastern men in his employ, who had never been in the Far West, nor knew anything
of the wilderness. With these, he was bravely steering his way across the continent,
undismayed by danger, difficulty, or distance, in the same way that a New England
coaster and his neighbors will coolly launch forth on a voyage to the Black Sea, or a
whaling cruise to the Pacific. 

<p> With all their national aptitude at expedient and resource, Wyeth and his men felt
themselves completely at a loss when they reached the frontier, and found that the
wilderness required experience and habitudes of which they were totally deficient. Not
one of the party, excepting the leader, had ever seen an Indian or handled a rifle; they
were without guide or interpreter, and totally unacquainted with "wood craft" and the
modes of making their way among savage hordes, and subsisting themselves during
long marches over wild mountains and barren plains.

<p> In this predicament, Captain Sublette found them, in a manner becalmed, or rather run
aground, at the little frontier town of Independence, in Missouri, and kindly took them in
tow. The two parties travelled amicably together; the frontier men of Sublette's party
gave their Yankee comrades some lessons in hunting, and some insight into the art and
mystery of dealing with the Indians, and they all arrived without accident at the upper
branches of the Nebraska or Platte River. 

<p> In the course of their march, Mr. Fitzpatrick, the partner of the company who was
resident at that time beyond the mountains, came down from the rendezvous at Pierre's
Hole to meet them and hurry them forward. He travelled in company with them until
they reached the Sweet Water; then taking a couple of horses, one for the saddle, and
the other as a pack-horse, he started off express for Pierre's Hole, to make
arrangements against their arrival, that he might commence his hunting campaign
before the rival company. 

<p> Fitzpatrick was a hardy and experienced mountaineer, and knew all the passes and
defiles. As he was pursuing his lonely course up the Green River valley, he described
several horsemen at a distance, and came to a halt to reconnoitre. He supposed them
to be some detachment from the rendezvous, or a party of friendly Indians. They
perceived him, and setting up the war-whoop, dashed forward at full speed: he saw at
once his mistake and his peril--they were Blackfeet. Springing upon his fleetest horse,
and abandoning the other to the enemy, he made for the mountains, and succeeded in
escaping up one of the most dangerous defiles. Here he concealed himself until he
thought the Indians had gone off, when he returned into the valley. He was again
pursued, lost his remaining horse, and only escaped by scrambling up among the cliffs.
For several days he remained lurking among rocks and precipices, and almost
famished, having but one remaining charge in his rifle, which he kept for self-defence. 

<p> In the meantime, Sublette and Campbell, with their fellow traveller, Wyeth, had pursued
their march unmolested, and arrived in the Green River valley, totally unconscious that
there was any lurking enemy at hand. They had encamped one night on the banks of a
small stream, which came down from the Wind River Mountains, when about midnight,
a band of Indians burst upon their camp, with horrible yells and whoops, and a
discharge of guns and arrows. Happily no other harm was done than wounding one
mule, and causing several horses to break loose from their pickets. The camp was
instantly in arms; but the Indians retreated with yells of exultation, carrying off several of
the horses under cover of the night.

<p> This was somewhat of a disagreeable foretaste of mountain life to some of Wyeth's
band, accustomed only to the regular and peaceful life of New England; nor was it
altogether to the taste of Captain Sublette's men, who were chiefly creoles and
townsmen from St. Louis. They continued their march the next morning, keeping scouts
ahead and upon their flanks, and arrived without further molestation at Pierre's Hole.

<p> The first inquiry of Captain Sublette, on reaching the rendezvous, was for Fitzpatrick.
He had not arrived, nor had any intelligence been received concerning him. Great
uneasiness was now entertained, lest he should have fallen into the hands of the
Blackfeet who had made the midnight attack upon the camp. It was a matter of general
joy, therefore, when he made his appearance, conducted by two half-breed Iroquois
hunters. He had lurked for several days among the mountains, until almost starved; at
length he escaped the vigilance of his enemies in the night, and was so fortunate as to
meet the two Iroquois hunters, who, being on horseback, conveyed him without further
difficulty to the rendezvous. He arrived there so emaciated that he could scarcely be
recognized.

<p> The valley called Pierre's Hole is about thirty miles in length and fifteen in width,
bounded to the west and south by low and broken ridges, and overlooked to the east by
three lofty mountains, called the three Tetons, which domineer as landmarks over a
vast extent of country. 

<p> A fine stream, fed by rivulets and mountain springs, pours through the valley toward the
north, dividing it into nearly equal parts. The meadows on its borders are broad and
extensive, covered with willow and cotton-wood trees, so closely interlocked and matted
together as to be nearly impassable. 

<p> In this valley was congregated the motley populace connected with the fur trade. Here
the two rival companies had their encampments, with their retainers of all kinds: traders,
trappers, hunters, and half-breeds, assembled from all quarters, awaiting their yearly
supplies, and their orders to start off in new directions. Here, also, the savage tribes
connected with the trade, the Nez Perces or Chopunnish Indians, and Flatheads, had
pitched their lodges beside the streams, and with their squaws, awaited the distribution
of goods and finery. There was, moreover, a band of fifteen free trappers, commanded
by a gallant leader from Arkansas, named Sinclair, who held their encampment a little
apart from the rest. Such was the wild and heterogeneous assemblage, amounting to
several hundred men, civilized and savage, distributed in tents and lodges in the
several camps.

<p> The arrival of Captain Sublette with supplies put the Rocky Mountain Fur Company in
full activity. The wares and merchandise were quickly opened, and as quickly disposed
of to trappers and Indians; the usual excitement and revelry took place, after which all
hands began to disperse to their several destinations. 

<p><a name="phfight"> On the 17th of July, a small brigade of fourteen
trappers, led by Milton Sublette, brother
of the captain, set out with the intention of proceeding to the southwest. They were
accompanied by Sinclair and his fifteen free trappers; Wyeth, also, and his New
England band of beaver hunters and salmon fishers, now dwindled down to eleven,
took this opportunity to prosecute their cruise in the wilderness, accompanied with such
experienced pilots. On the first day, they proceeded about eight miles to the southeast,
and encamped for the night, still in the valley of Pierre's Hole. On the following morning,
just as they were raising their camp, they observed a long line of people pouring down a
defile of the mountains. They at first supposed them to be Fontenelle and his party,
whose arrival had been daily expected. Wyeth, however, reconnoitred them with a spy-glass, and
soon perceived they were Indians. They were divided into two parties,
forming, in the whole, about one hundred and fifty persons, men, women, and children.
Some were on horseback, fantastically painted and arrayed, with scarlet blankets
fluttering in the wind. The greater part, however, were on foot. They had perceived the
trappers before they were themselves discovered, and came down yelling and
whooping into the plain. On nearer approach, they were ascertained to be Blackfeet. 

<p> One of the trappers of Sublette's brigade, a half-breed named Antoine Godin, now
mounted his horse, and rode forth as if to hold a conference. He was the son of an
Iroquois hunter, who had been cruelly murdered by the Blackfeet at a small stream
below the mountains, which still bears his name. In company with Antoine rode forth a
Flathead Indian, whose once powerful tribe had been completely broken down in their
wars with the Blackfeet. Both of them, therefore, cherished the most vengeful hostility
against these marauders of the mountains. The Blackfeet came to a halt. One of the
chiefs advanced singly and unarmed, bearing the pipe of peace. This overture was
certainly pacific; but Antoine and the Flathead were predisposed to hostility, and
pretended to consider it a treacherous movement. 

<p> "Is your piece charged?" said Antoine to his red companion. 

<p> "It is." 

<p> "Then cock it, and follow me." 

<p> They met the Blackfoot chief half way, who extended his hand in friendship. Antoine
grasped it. 

<p> "Fire! " cried he. 

<p> The Flathead levelled his piece, and brought the Blackfoot to the ground. Antoine
snatched off his scarlet blanket, which was richly ornamented, and galloped off with it
as a trophy to the camp, the bullets of the enemy whistling after him. The Indians
immediately threw themselves into the edge of a swamp, among willows and cotton-wood trees,
interwoven with vines. Here they began to fortify themselves; the women
digging a trench, and throwing up a breastwork of logs and branches, deep hid in the
bosom of the wood, while the warriors skirmished at the edge to keep the trappers at
bay. 

<p> The latter took their station in a ravine in front, whence they kept up a scattering fire. As
to Wyeth, and his little band of "downeasters," they were perfectly astounded by this
second specimen of life in the wilderness; the men, being especially unused to
bushfighting and the use of the rifle, were at a loss how to proceed. Wyeth, however,
acted as a skilful commander. He got all his horses into camp and secured them; then,
making a breastwork of his packs of goods, he charged his men to remain in garrison,
and not to stir out of their fort. For himself, he mingled with the other leaders,
determined to take his share in the conflict. 

<p> In the meantime, an express had been sent off to the rendezvous for reinforcements.
Captain Sublette, and his associate, Campbell, were at their camp when the express
came galloping across the plain, waving his cap, and giving the alarm; "Blackfeet!
Blackfeet! a fight in the upper part of the valley!--to arms! to arms!" 

<p> The alarm was passed from camp to camp. It was a common cause. Every one turned
out with horse and rifle. The Nez Perces and Flatheads joined. As fast as horseman
could arm and mount he galloped off; the valley was soon alive with white men and red
men scouring at full speed. 

<p> Sublette ordered his men to keep to the camp, being recruits from St. Louis, and
unused to Indian warfare. He and his friend Campbell prepared for action. Throwing off
their coats, rolling up their sleeves, and arming themselves with pistols and rifles, they
mounted their horses and dashed forward among the first. As they rode along, they
made their wills in soldier-like style; each stating how his effects should be disposed of
in case of his death, and appointing the other his executor. 

<p> The Blackfeet warriors had supposed the brigade of Milton Sublette all the foes they
had to deal with, and were astonished to behold the whole valley suddenly swarming
with horsemen, galloping to the field of action. They withdrew into their fort, which was
completely hid from sight in the dark and tangled wood. Most of their women and
children had retreated to the mountains. The trappers now sallied forth and approached
the swamp, firing into the thickets at random; the Blackfeet had a better sight at their
adversaries, who were in the open field, and a half-breed was wounded in the shoulder.

<p> When Captain Sublette arrived, he urged to penetrate the swamp and storm the fort,
but all hung back in awe of the dismal horrors of the place, and the danger of attacking
such desperadoes in their savage den. The very Indian allies, though accustomed to
bushfighting, regarded it as almost impenetrable, and full of frightful danger. Sublette
was not to be turned from his purpose, but offered to lead the way into the swamp.
Campbell stepped forward to accompany him. Before entering the perilous wood,
Sublette took his brothers aside, and told them that in case he fell, Campbell, who knew
his will, was to be his executor. This done, he grasped his rifle and pushed into the
thickets, followed by Campbell. Sinclair, the partisan from Arkansas, was at the edge of
the wood with his brother and a few of his men. Excited by the gallant example of the
two friends, he pressed forward to share their dangers. 

<p> The swamp was produced by the labors of the beaver, which, by damming up a stream,
had inundated a portion of the valley. The place was all overgrown with woods and
thickets, so closely matted and entangled that it was impossible to see ten paces
ahead, and the three associates in peril had to crawl along, one after another, making
their way by putting the branches and vines aside; but doing it with caution, lest they
should attract the eye of some lurking marksman. They took the lead by turns, each
advancing about twenty yards at a time, and now and then hallooing to their men to
follow. Some of the latter gradually entered the swamp, and followed a little distance in
their rear. 

<p> They had now reached a more open part of the wood, and had glimpses of the rude
fortress from between the trees. It was a mere breastwork, as we have said, of logs and
branches, with blankets, buffalo robes, and the leathern covers of lodges, extended
round the top as a screen. The movements of the leaders, as they groped their way,
had been descried by the sharp-sighted enemy. As Sinclair, who was in the advance,
was putting some branches aside, he was shot through the body. He fell on the spot.
"Take me to my brother,'' said he to Campbell. The latter gave him in charge to some of
the men, who conveyed him out of the swamp.

<p> Sublette now took the advance. As he was reconnoitring the fort, he perceived an
Indian peeping through an aperture. In an instant his rifle was levelled and discharged,
and the ball struck the savage in the eye. While he was reloading, he called to
Campbell, and pointed out to him the hole; "Watch that place," said he, "and you will
soon have a fair chance for a shot." Scarce had he uttered the words, when a ball
struck him in the shoulder, and almost wheeled him around. His first thought was to
take hold of his arm with his other hand, and move it up and down. He ascertained, to
his satisfaction, that the bone was not broken. The next moment he was so faint that he
could not stand. Campbell took him in his arms and carried him out of the thicket. The
same shot that struck Sublette wounded another man in the head. 

<p> A brisk fire was now opened by the mountaineers from the wood, answered
occasionally from the fort. Unluckily, the trappers and their allies, in searching for the
fort, had got scattered, so that Wyeth, and a number of Nez Perces, approached the
fort on the northwest side, while others did the same on the opposite quarter. A cross-fire thus
took place, which occasionally did mischief to friends as well as foes. An Indian
was shot down, close to Wyeth, by a ball which, he was convinced, had been sped from
the rifle of a trapper on the other side of the fort. 

<p> The number of whites and their Indian allies had by this time so much increased by
arrivals from the rendezvous, that the Blackfeet were completely overmatched. They
kept doggedly in their fort, however, making no offer of surrender. An occasional firing
into the breastwork was kept up during the day. Now and then, one of the Indian allies,
in bravado, would rush up to the fort, fire over the ramparts, tear off a buffalo robe or a
scarlet blanket, and return with it in triumph to his comrades. Most of the savage
garrison that fell, however, were killed in the first part of the attack. 

<p> At one time it was resolved to set fire to the fort; and the squaws belonging to the allies
were employed to collect combustibles. This however, was abandoned; the Nez Perces
being unwilling to destroy the robes and blankets, and other spoils of the enemy, which
they felt sure would fall into their hands. 

<p> The Indians, when fighting, are prone to taunt and revile each other. During one of the
pauses of the battle, the voice of the Blackfeet chief was heard. 

<p> "So long," said he, "as we had powder and ball, we fought you in the open field: when
those were spent, we retreated here to die with our women and children. You may burn
us in our fort; but, stay by our ashes, and you who are so hungry for fighting will soon
have enough. There are four hundred lodges of our brethren at hand. They will soon be
here--their arms are strong--their hearts are big--they will avenge us!" 

<p> This speech was translated two or three times by Nez Perce and creole interpreters. By
the time it was rendered into English, the chief was made to say that four hundred
lodges of his tribe were attacking the encampment at the other end of the valley. Every
one now was for hurrying to the defence of the rendezvous. A party was left to keep
watch upon the fort; the rest galloped off to the camp. As night came on, the trappers
drew out of the swamp, and remained about the skirts of the wood. By morning, their
companions returned from the rendezvous with the report that all was safe. As the day
opened, they ventured within the swamp and approached the fort. All was silent. They
advanced up to it without opposition. They entered: it had been abandoned in the night,
and the Blackfeet had effected their retreat, carrying off their wounded on litters made
of branches, leaving bloody traces on the herbage. The bodies of ten Indians were
found within the fort; among them the one shot in the eye by Sublette. The Blackfeet
afterward reported that they had lost twenty-six warriors in this battle. Thirty-two horses
were likewise found killed; among them were some of those recently carried off from
Sublette's party, in the night; which showed that these were the very savages that had
attacked him. They proved to be an advance party of the main body of Blackfeet, which
had been upon the trail of Sublette's party. Five white men and one halfbreed were
killed, and several wounded. Seven of the Nez Perces were also killed, and six
wounded. They had an old chief, who was reputed as invulnerable. In the course of the
action he was hit by a spent ball, and threw up blood; but his skin was unbroken. His
people were now fully convinced that he was proof against powder and ball. 

<p> A striking circumstance is related as having occurred the morning after the battle. As
some of the trappers and their Indian allies were approaching the fort through the
woods, they beheld an Indian woman, of noble form and features, leaning against a
tree. Their surprise at her lingering here alone, to fall into the hands of her enemies,
was dispelled, when they saw the corpse of a warrior at her feet. Either she was so lost
in grief as not to perceive their approach; or a proud spirit kept her silent and
motionless. The Indians set up a yell, on discovering her, and before the trappers could
interfere, her mangled body fell upon the corpse which she had refused to abandon.
We have heard this anecdote discredited by one of the leaders who had been in the
battle: but the fact may have taken place without his seeing it, and been concealed from
him. It is an instance of female devotion, even to the death, which we are well disposed
to believe and to record. </a>

<p> After the battle, the brigade of Milton Sublette, together with the free trappers, and
Wyeth's New England band, remained some days at the rendezvous, to see if the main
body of Blackfeet intended to make an attack; nothing of the kind occurring, they once
more put themselves in motion, and proceeded on their route toward the southwest.
Captain Sublette having distributed his supplies, had intended to set off on his return to
St. Louis, taking with him the peltries collected from the trappers and Indians. His
wound, however obliged him to postpone his departure. Several who were to have
accompanied him became impatient of this delay. Among these was a young
Bostonian, Mr. Joseph More, one of the followers of Mr. Wyeth, who had seen enough
of mountain life and savage warfare, and was eager to return to the abodes of
civilization. He and six others, among whom were a Mr. Foy, of Mississippi, Mr. Alfred
K. Stephens, of St. Louis, and two grandsons of the celebrated Daniel Boon, set out
together, in advance of Sublette's party, thinking they would make their way through the
mountains. 

<p> It was just five days after the battle of the swamp that these seven companions were
making their way through Jackson's Hole, a valley not far from the three Tetons, when,
as they were descending a hill, a party of Blackfeet that lay in ambush started up with
terrific yells. The horse of the young Bostonian, who was in front, wheeled round with
affright, and threw his unskilled rider. The young man scrambled up the side of the hill,
but, unaccustomed to such wild scenes, lost his presence of mind, and stood, as if
paralyzed, on the edge of a bank, until the Blackfeet came up and slew him on the spot.
His comrades had fled on the first alarm; but two of them, Foy and Stephens, seeing his
danger, paused when they got half way up the hill, turned back, dismounted, and
hastened to his assistance. Foy was instantly killed. Stephens was severely wounded,
but escaped, to die five days afterward. The survivors returned to the camp of Captain
Sublette, bringing tidings of this new disaster. That hardy leader, as soon as he could
bear the journey, set out on his return to St. Louis, accompanied by Campbell. As they
had a number of pack-horses richly laden with peltries to convoy, they chose a different
route through the mountains, out of the way, as they hoped, of the lurking bands of
Blackfeet. They succeeded in making the frontier in safety. We remember to have seen
them with their band, about two or three months afterward, passing through a skirt of
woodland in the upper part of Missouri. Their long cavalcade stretched in single file for
nearly half a mile. Sublette still wore his arm in a sling. The mountaineers in their rude
hunting dresses, armed with rifles and roughly mounted, and leading their pack-horses
down a hill of the forest, looked like banditti returning with plunder. On the top of some
of the packs were perched several half-breed children, perfect little imps, with wild black
eyes glaring from among elf locks. These, I was told, were children of the trappers;
pledges of love from their squaw spouses in the wilderness.
