<p> IT WAS ON THE FIRST of May, 1832, that Captain Bonneville took his departure from
the frontier post of Fort Osage, on the Missouri. He had enlisted a party of one hundred
and ten men, most of whom had been in the Indian country, and some of whom were
experienced hunters and trappers. Fort Osage, and other places on the borders of the
western wilderness, abound with characters of the kind, ready for any expedition. 


<p> The ordinary mode of transportation in these great inland expeditions of the fur traders
is on mules and pack-horses; but Captain Bonneville substituted wagons. Though he
was to travel through a trackless wilderness, yet the greater part of his route would lie
across open plains, destitute of forests, and where wheel carriages can pass in every
direction. The chief difficulty occurs in passing the deep ravines cut through the prairies
by streams and winter torrents. Here it is often necessary to dig a road down the banks,
and to make bridges for the wagons. 


<p> In transporting his baggage in vehicles of this kind, Captain Bonneville thought he
would save the great delay caused every morning by packing the horses, and the labor
of unpacking in the evening. Fewer horses also would be required, and less risk
incurred of their wandering away, or being frightened or carried off by the Indians. The
wagons, also, would be more easily defended, and might form a kind of fortification in
case of attack in the open prairies. A train of twenty wagons, drawn by oxen, or by four
mules or horses each, and laden with merchandise, ammunition, and provisions, were
disposed in two columns in the center of the party, which was equally divided into a van
and a rear-guard. As subleaders or lieutenants in his expedition, Captain Bonneville
had made choice of Mr. J. R. Walker and Mr. M. S. Cerre. The former was a native of
Tennessee, about six feet high, strong built, dark complexioned, brave in spirit, though
mild in manners. He had resided for many years in Missouri, on the frontier; had been
among the earliest adventurers to Santa Fe, where he went to trap beaver, and was
taken by the Spaniards. Being liberated, he engaged with the Spaniards and Sioux
Indians in a war against the Pawnees; then returned to Missouri, and had acted by
turns as sheriff, trader, trapper, until he was enlisted as a leader by Captain Bonneville. 


<p> Cerre, his other leader, had likewise been in expeditions to Santa Fe, in which he had
endured much hardship. He was of the middle size, light complexioned, and though but
about twenty-five years of age, was considered an experienced Indian trader. It was a
great object with Captain Bonneville to get to the mountains before the summer heats
and summer flies should render the travelling across the prairies distressing; and before
the annual assemblages of people connected with the fur trade should have broken up,
and dispersed to the hunting grounds. 


<p> The two rival associations already mentioned, the American Fur Company and the
Rocky Mountain Fur Company, had their several places of rendezvous for the present
year at no great distance apart, in Pierre's Hole, a deep valley in the heart of the
mountains, and thither Captain Bonneville intended to shape his course. 


<p> It is not easy to do justice to the exulting feelings of the worthy captain at finding himself
at the head of a stout band of hunters, trappers, and woodmen; fairly launched on the
broad prairies, with his face to the boundless West. The tamest inhabitant of cities, the
veriest spoiled child of civilization, feels his heart dilate and his pulse beat high on
finding himself on horseback in the glorious wilderness; what then must be the
excitement of one whose imagination had been stimulated by a residence on the
frontier, and to whom the wilderness was a region of romance! 


<p> His hardy followers partook of his excitement. Most of them had already experienced
the wild freedom of savage life, and looked forward to a renewal of past scenes of
adventure and exploit. Their very appearance and equipment exhibited a piebald
mixture, half civilized and half savage. Many of them looked more like Indians than
white men in their garbs and accoutrements, and their very horses were caparisoned in
barbaric style, with fantastic trappings. The outset of a band of adventurers on one of
these expeditions is always animated and joyous. The welkin rang with their shouts and
yelps, after the manner of the savages; and with boisterous jokes and light-hearted
laughter. As they passed the straggling hamlets and solitary cabins that fringe the skirts
of the frontier, they would startle their inmates by Indian yells and war-whoops, or
regale them with grotesque feats of horsemanship, well suited to their halfsavage
appearance. Most of these abodes were inhabited by men who had themselves been in
similar expeditions; they welcomed the travellers, therefore, as brother trappers, treated
them with a hunter's hospitality, and cheered them with an honest God speed at
parting. 


<p> And here we would remark a great difference, in point of character and quality, between
the two classes of trappers, the "American" and "French," as they are called in
contradistinction. The latter is meant to designate the French creole of Canada or
Louisiana; the former, the trapper of the old American stock, from Kentucky,
Tennessee, and others of the western States. The French trapper is represented as a
lighter, softer, more self-indulgent kind of man. He must have his Indian wife, his lodge,
and his petty conveniences. He is gay and thoughtless, takes little heed of landmarks,
depends upon his leaders and companions to think for the common weal, and, if left to
himself, is easily perplexed and lost. 


<p> The American trapper stands by himself, and is peerless for the service of the
wilderness. Drop him in the midst of a prairie, or in the heart of the mountains, and he is
never at a loss. He notices every landmark; can retrace his route through the most
monotonous plains, or the most perplexed labyrinths of the mountains; no danger nor
difficulty can appal him, and he scorns to complain under any privation. In equipping the
two kinds of trappers, the Creole and Canadian are apt to prefer the light fusee; the
American always grasps his rifle; he despises what he calls the "shot-gun." We give
these estimates on the authority of a trader of long experience, and a foreigner by birth.
"I consider one American," said he, "equal to three Canadians in point of sagacity,
aptness at resources, self-dependence, and fearlessness of spirit. In fact, no one can
cope with him as a stark tramper of the wilderness." 


<p> Beside the two classes of trappers just mentioned, Captain Bonneville had enlisted
several Delaware Indians in his employ, on whose hunting qualifications he placed
great reliance. 


<p> On the 6th of May the travellers passed the last border habitation, and bade a long
farewell to the ease and security of civilization. The buoyant and clamorous spirits with
which they had commenced their march gradually subsided as they entered upon its
difficulties. They found the prairies saturated with the heavy cold rains, prevalent in
certain seasons of the year in this part of the country, the wagon wheels sank deep in
the mire, the horses were often to the fetlock, and both steed and rider were completely
jaded by the evening of the 12th, when they reached the Kansas River; a fine stream
about three hundred yards wide, entering the Missouri from the south. Though fordable
in almost every part at the end of summer and during the autumn, yet it was necessary
to construct a raft for the transportation of the wagons and effects. All this was done in
the course of the following day, and by evening, the whole party arrived at the agency
of the Kansas tribe. This was under the superintendence of General Clarke, brother of
the celebrated traveller of the same name, who, with Lewis, made the first expedition
down the waters of the Columbia. He was living like a patriarch, surrounded by laborers
and interpreters, all snugly housed, and provided with excellent farms. The functionary
next in consequence to the agent was the blacksmith, a most important, and, indeed,
indispensable personage in a frontier community. The Kansas resemble the Osages in
features, dress, and language; they raise corn and hunt the buffalo, ranging the Kansas
River, and its tributary streams; at the time of the captain's visit, they were at war with
the Pawnees of the Nebraska, or Platte River. 


<p> The unusual sight of a train of wagons caused quite a sensation among these savages;
who thronged about the caravan, examining everything minutely, and asking a
thousand questions: exhibiting a degree of excitability, and a lively curiosity totally
opposite to that apathy with which their race is so often reproached. 


<p> The personage who most attracted the captain's attention at this place was "White
Plume," the Kansas chief, and they soon became good friends. White Plume (we are
pleased with his chivalrous <em>soubriquet</em>) inhabited a large stone house, built for him
by
order of the American government: but the establishment had not been carried out in
corresponding style. It might be palace without, but it was wigwam within; so that,
between the stateliness of his mansion and the squalidness of his furniture, the gallant
White Plume presented some such whimsical incongruity as we see in the gala
equipments of an Indian chief on a treaty-making embassy at Washington, who has
been generously decked out in cocked hat and military coat, in contrast to his breech-clout and
leathern legging; being grand officer at top, and ragged Indian at bottom. 


<p> White Plume was so taken with the courtesy of the captain, and pleased with one or
two presents received from him, that he accompanied him a day's journey on his
march, and passed a night in his camp, on the margin of a small stream. The method of
encamping generally observed by the captain was as follows: The twenty wagons were
disposed in a square, at the distance of thirty-three feet from each other. In every
interval there was a mess stationed; and each mess had its fire, where the men
cooked, ate, gossiped, and slept. The horses were placed in the centre of the square,
with a guard stationed over them at night. 


<p> The horses were "side lined," as it is termed: that is to say, the fore and hind foot on the
same side of the animal were tied together, so as to be within eighteen inches of each
other. A horse thus fettered is for a time sadly embarrassed, but soon becomes
sufficiently accustomed to the restraint to move about slowly. It prevents his wandering;
and his being easily carried off at night by lurking Indians. When a horse that is "foot
free" is tied to one thus secured, the latter forms, as it were, a pivot, round which the
other runs and curvets, in case of alarm. The encampment of which we are speaking
presented a striking scene. The various mess-fires were surrounded by picturesque
groups, standing, sitting, and reclining; some busied in cooking, others in cleaning their
weapons: while the frequent laugh told that the rough joke or merry story was going on.
In the middle of the camp, before the principal lodge, sat the two chieftains, Captain
Bonneville and White Plume, in soldier-like communion, the captain delighted with the
opportunity of meeting on social terms with one of the red warriors of the wilderness,
the unsophisticated children of nature. The latter was squatted on his buffalo robe, his
strong features and red skin glaring in the broad light of a blazing fire, while he
recounted astounding tales of the bloody exploits of his tribe and himself in their wars
with the Pawnees; for there are no old soldiers more given to long campaigning stories
than Indian "braves." 


<p> The feuds of White Plume, however, had not been confined to the red men; he had
much to say of brushes with bee hunters, a class of offenders for whom he seemed to
cherish a particular abhorrence. As the species of hunting prosecuted by these worthies
is not laid down in any of the ancient books of venerie, and is, in fact, peculiar to our
western frontier, a word or two on the subject may not be unacceptable to the reader. 


<p> The bee hunter is generally some settler on the verge of the prairies; a long, lank fellow,
of fever and ague complexion, acquired from living on new soil, and in a hut built of
green logs. In the autumn, when the harvest is over, these; frontier settlers form parties
of two or three, and prepare for a bee hunt. Having provided themselves with a wagon,
and a number of empty casks, they sally off, armed with their rifles, into the wilderness,
directing their course east, west, north, or south, without any regard to the ordinance of
the American government, which strictly forbids all trespass upon the lands belonging to
the Indian tribes. 


<p> The belts of woodland that traverse the lower prairies and border the rivers are peopled
by innumerable swarms of wild bees, which make their hives in hollow trees and fill
them with honey tolled from the rich flowers of the prairies. The bees, according to
popular assertion, are migrating like the settlers, to the west. An Indian trader, well
experienced in the country, informs us that within ten years that he has passed in the
Far West, the bee has advanced westward above a hundred miles. It is said on the
Missouri, that the wild turkey and the wild bee go up the river together: neither is found
in the upper regions. It is but recently that the wild turkey has been killed on the
Nebraska, or Platte; and his travelling competitor, the wild bee, appeared there about
the same time. 


<p> Be all this as it may: the course of our party of bee hunters is to make a wide circuit
through the woody river bottoms, and the patches of forest on the prairies, marking, as
they go out, every tree in which they have detected a hive. These marks are generally
respected by any other bee hunter that should come upon their track. When they have
marked sufficient to fill all their casks, they turn their faces homeward, cut down the
trees as they proceed, and having loaded their wagon with honey and wax, return well
pleased to the settlements. 


<p> Now it so happens that the Indians relish wild honey as highly as do the white men, and
are the more delighted with this natural luxury from its having, in many instances, but
recently made its appearance in their lands. The consequence is numberless disputes
and conflicts between them and the bee hunters: and often a party of the latter,
returning, laden with rich spoil, from one of their forays, are apt to be waylaid by the
native lords of the soil; their honey to be seized, their harness cut to pieces, and
themselves left to find their way home the best way they can, happy to escape with no
greater personal harm than a sound rib-roasting. 


<p> Such were the marauders of whose offences the gallant White Plume made the most
bitter complaint. They were chiefly the settlers of the western part of Missouri, who are
the most famous bee hunters on the frontier, and whose favorite hunting ground lies
within the lands of the Kansas tribe. According to the account of White Plume, however,
matters were pretty fairly balanced between him and the offenders; he having as often
treated them to a taste of the bitter, as they had robbed him of the sweets. 


<p> It is but justice to this gallant chief to say that he gave proofs of having acquired some
of the lights of civilization from his proximity to the whites, as was evinced in his
knowledge of driving a bargain. He required hard cash in return for some corn with
which he supplied the worthy captain, and left the latter at a loss which most to admire,
his native chivalry as a brave, or his acquired adroitness as a trader.
