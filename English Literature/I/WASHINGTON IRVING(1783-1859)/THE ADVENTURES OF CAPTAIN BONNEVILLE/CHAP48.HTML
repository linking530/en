<p> THE winter was now breaking up, the snows were melted, from the hills, and from the lower
parts
of the mountains, and the time for decamping had arrived. Captain Bonneville dispatched a party
to
the caches, who brought away all the effects concealed there, and on the 1st of April (1835) , the
camp was broken up, and every one on the move. The white men and their allies, the Eutaws and
Shoshonies, parted with many regrets and sincere expressions of good-will; for their intercourse
throughout the winter had been of the most friendly kind.

<p> Captain Bonneville and his party passed by Ham's Fork, and reached the Colorado, or Green
River,
without accident, on the banks of which they remained during the residue of the spring. During
this
time, they were conscious that a band of hostile Indians were hovering about their vicinity,
watching
for an opportunity to slay or steal; but the vigilant precautions of Captain Bonneville baffled all
their
manoeuvres. In such dangerous times, the experienced mountaineer is never without his rifle
even
in camp. On going from lodge to lodge to visit his comrades, he takes it with him. On seating
himself in a lodge, he lays it beside him, ready to be snatched up; when he goes out, he takes it
up
as regularly as a citizen would his walking-staff. His rifle is his constant friend and protector.

<p> On the 10th of June, the party was a little to the east of the Wind River Mountains, where
they halted
for a time in excellent pasturage, to give their horses a chance to recruit their strength for a long
journey; for it was Captain Bonneville's intention to shape his course to the settlements; having
already been detained by the complication of his duties, and by various losses and impediments,
far
beyond the time specified in his leave of absence.

<p> While the party was thus reposing in the neighborhood of the Wind River Mountains, a
solitary free
trapper rode one day into the camp, and accosted Captain Bonneville. He belonged, he said, to a
party of thirty hunters, who had just passed through the neighborhood, but whom he had
abandoned
in consequence of their ill treatment of a brother trapper; whom they had cast off from their
party,
and left with his bag and baggage, and an Indian wife into the bargain, in the midst of a desolate
prairie. The horseman gave a piteous account of the situation of this helpless pair, and solicited
the
loan of horses to bring them and their effects to the camp.

<p> The captain was not a man to refuse assistance to any one in distress, especially when there
was a
woman in the case; horses were immediately dispatched, with an escort, to aid the unfortunate
couple. The next day they made their appearance with all their effects; the man, a stalwart
mountaineer, with a peculiarly game look; the woman, a young Blackfoot beauty, arrayed in the
trappings and trinketry of a free trapper's bride.

<p> Finding the woman to be quick-witted and communicative, Captain Bonneville entered into
conversation with her, and obtained from her many particulars concerning the habits and customs
of her tribe; especially their wars and huntings. They pride themselves upon being the "best legs
of
the mountains," and hunt the buffalo on foot. This is done in spring time, when the frosts have
thawed and the ground is soft. The heavy buffaloes then sink over their hoofs at every step, and
are
easily overtaken by the Blackfeet, whose fleet steps press lightly on the surface. It is said,
however,
that the buffaloes on the Pacific side of the Rocky Mountains are fleeter and more active than on
the
Atlantic side; those upon the plains of the Columbia can scarcely be overtaken by a horse that
would
outstrip the same animal in the neighborhood of the Platte, the usual hunting ground of the
Blackfeet.
In the course of further conversation, Captain Bonneville drew from the Indian woman her whole
story; which gave a picture of savage life, and of the drudgery and hardships to which an Indian
wife
is subject.

<p> "I was the wife," said she, "of a Blackfoot warrior, and I served him faithfully. Who was so
well
served as he? Whose lodge was so well provided, or kept so clean? I brought wood in the
morning,
and placed water always at hand. I watched for his coming; and he found his meat cooked and
ready.
If he rose to go forth, there was nothing to delay him. I searched the thought that was in his heart,
to save him the trouble of speaking. When I went abroad on errands for him, the chiefs and
warriors
smiled upon me, and the young braves spoke soft things, in secret; but my feet were in the
straight
path, and my eyes could see nothing but him.

<p> "When he went out to hunt, or to war, who aided to equip him, but I? When he returned, I
met him
at the door; I took his gun; and he entered without further thought. While he sat and smoked, I
unloaded his horses; tied them to the stakes, brought in their loads, and was quickly at his feet. If
his
moccasins were wet I took them off and put on others which were dry and warm. I dressed all the
skins he had taken in the chase. He could never say to me, why is it not done? He hunted the
deer,
the antelope, and the buffalo, and he watched for the enemy. Everything else was done by me.
When
our people moved their camp, he mounted his horse and rode away; free as though he had fallen
from the skies. He had nothing to do with the labor of the camp; it <em>was </em>I that packed
the horses and
led them on the journey. When we halted in the evening, and he sat with the other braves and
smoked, it was I that pitched his lodge; and when he came to eat and sleep, his supper and his
bed
were ready.

<p> "I served him faithfully; and what was my reward? A cloud was always on his brow, and
sharp
lightning on his tongue. I was his dog; and not his wife.

<p> "Who was it that scarred and bruised me? It was he. My brother saw how I was treated. His
heart
was big for me. He begged me to leave my tyrant and fly. Where could I go? If retaken, who
would
protect me? My brother was not a chief; he could not save me from blows and wounds, perhaps
death.  At length I was persuaded. I followed my brother from the village. He pointed away to
the
Nez Perces, and bade me go and live in peace among them. We parted. On the third day I saw the
lodges of the Nez Perces before me. 1 paused for a moment, and had no heart to go on; but my
horse
neighed, and I took it as a good sign, and suffered him to gallop forward. In a little while I was in
the midst of the lodges. As I sat silent on my horse, the people gathered round me, and inquired
whence I came. I told my story. A chief now wrapped his blanket close around him, and bade me
dismount. I obeyed. He took my horse to lead him away.  My heart grew small within me. I felt,
on
parting with my horse, as if my last friend was gone. I had no words, and my eyes were dry. As
he
led off my horse a young brave stepped forward. 'Are you a chief of the people?' cried he. 'Do we
listen to you in council, and follow you in battle? Behold! a stranger flies to our camp from the
dogs
of Blackfeet, and asks protection. Let shame cover your face! The stranger is a woman, and
alone.
If she were a warrior, or had a warrior at her side, your heart would not be big enough to take her
horse. But he is yours. By right of war you may claim him; but look!' - his bow was drawn, and
the
arrow ready! - 'you never shall cross his back!' The arrow pierced the heart of the horse, and he
fell
dead.

<p> "An old woman said she would be my mother. She led me to her lodge; my heart was
thawed by her
kindness, and my eyes burst forth with tears; like the frozen fountains in springtime. She never
changed; but as the days passed away, was still a mother to me. The people were loud in praise
of
the young brave, and the chief was ashamed. I lived in peace.

<p> "A party of trappers came to the village, and one of them took me for his wife. This
is he. I am very happy; he treats me with kindness, and I have taught him the
language of my people. As we were travelling this way, some of the Blackfeet
warriors beset us, and carried off the horses of the party. We followed, and my
husband held a parley with them. The guns were laid down, and the pipe was lighted;
but some of the white men attempted to seize the horses by force, and then a battle
began. The snow was deep, the white men sank into it at every step; but the red men,
with their snow-shoes, passed over the surface like birds, and drove off many of the
horses in sight of their owners. With those that remained we resumed our journey. At
length words took place between the leader of the party and my husband. He took
away our horses, which had escaped in the battle, and turned us from his camp. My
husband had one good friend among the trappers. That is he (pointing to the man who
had asked assistance for them). He is a good man. His heart is big. When he came in
from hunting, and found that we had been driven away, he gave up all his wages, and
followed us, that he might speak good words for us to the white captain."
