<p> "UP and away!" is the first thought at daylight of the Indian trader, when a rival is at hand
and
distance is to be gained. Early in the morning, Captain Bonneville ordered the half dried meat to
be
packed upon the horses, and leaving Wyeth and his party to hunt the scattered buffalo, pushed off
rapidly to the east, to regain the plain of the Portneuf. His march was rugged and dangerous;
through
volcanic hills, broken into cliffs and precipices; and seamed with tremendous chasms, where the
rocks rose like walls.

<p> On the second day, however, he encamped once more in the plain, and as it was still early
some of
the men strolled out to the neighboring hills. In casting their eyes round the country, they
perceived
a great cloud of dust rising in the south, and evidently approaching. Hastening back to the camp,
they
gave the alarm.  Preparations were instantly made to receive an enemy; while some of the men,
throwing themselves upon the "running horses" kept for hunting, galloped off to reconnoitre. In a
little while, they made signals from a distance that all was friendly. By this time the cloud of dust
had swept on as if hurried along by a blast, and a band of wild horsemen came dashing at full
leap
into the camp, yelling and whooping like so many maniacs. Their dresses, their accoutrements,
their
mode of riding, and their uncouth clamor, made them seem a party of savages arrayed for war;
but
they proved to be principally half-breeds, and white men grown savage in the wilderness, who
were
employed as trappers and hunters in the service of the Hudson's Bay Company.

<p> Here was again "high jinks" in the camp. Captain Bonneville's men hailed these wild
scamperers as
congenial spirits, or rather as the very game birds of their class. They entertained them with the
hospitality of mountaineers, feasting them at every fire.  At first, there were mutual details of
adventures and exploits, and broad joking mingled with peals of laughter. Then came on boasting
of the comparative merits of horses and rifles, which soon engrossed every tongue. This naturally
led to racing, and shooting at a mark; one trial of speed and skill succeeded another, shouts and
acclamations rose from the victorious parties, fierce altercations succeeded, and a general melee
was
about to take place, when suddenly the attention of the quarrellers was arrested by a strange kind
of
Indian chant or chorus, that seemed to operate upon them as a charm. Their fury was at an end; a
tacit reconciliation succeeded and the ideas of the whole mongrel crowd whites, half-breeds and
squaws  were turned in a new direction. They all formed into groups and taking their places at
the
several fires, prepared for one of the most exciting amusements of the Nez Perces and the other
tribes
of the Far West.

<p> The choral chant, in fact, which had thus acted as a charm, was a kind of wild
accompaniment to the
favorite Indian game of "Hand." This is played by two parties drawn out in opposite platoons
before
a blazing fire. It is in some respects like the old game of passing the ring or the button, and
detecting
the hand which holds it. In the present game, the object hidden, or the <em>cache </em>as it is
called by the
trappers, is a small splint of wood, or other diminutive article that may be concealed in the closed
hand. This is passed backward and forward among the party "in hand," while the party "out of
hand"
guess where it is concealed. To heighten the excitement and confuse the guessers, a number of
dry
poles are laid before each platoon, upon which the members of the party "in hand" beat furiously
with short staves, keeping time to the choral chant already mentioned, which waxes fast and
furious
as the game proceeds. As large bets are staked upon the game, the excitement is prodigious. Each
party in turn bursts out in full chorus, beating, and yelling, and working themselves up into such
a
heat that the perspiration rolls down their naked shoulders, even in the cold of a winter night. The
bets are doubled and trebled as the game advances, the mental excitement increases almost to
madness, and all the worldly effects of the gamblers are often hazarded upon the position of a
straw.

<p> These gambling games were kept up throughout the night; every fire glared upon a group
that looked
like a crew of maniacs at their frantic orgies, and the scene would have been kept up throughout
the
succeeding day, had not Captain Bonneville interposed his authority, and, at the usual hour,
issued
his marching orders.

<p> Proceeding down the course of Snake River, the hunters regularly returned to camp in the
evening
laden with wild geese, which were yet scarcely able to fly, and were easily caught in great
numbers.
It was now the season of the annual fish-feast, with which the Indians in these parts celebrate the
first
appearance of the salmon in this river.  These fish are taken in great numbers at the numerous
falls
of about four feet pitch.  The Indians flank the shallow water just below, and spear them as they
attempt to pass. In wide parts of the river, also, they place a sort of chevaux-de-frize, or fence, of
poles interwoven with withes, and forming an angle in the middle of the current, where a small
opening is left for the salmon to pass. Around this opening the Indians station themselves on
small
rafts, and ply their spears with great success.

<p> The table lands so common in this region have a sandy soil, inconsiderable in depth, and
covered
with sage, or more properly speaking, wormwood.  Below this is a level stratum of rock, riven
occasionally by frightful chasms. The whole plain rises as it approaches the river, and terminates
with high and broken cliffs, difficult to pass, and in many places so precipitous that it is
impossible,
for days together, to get down to the water's edge, to give drink to the horses.  This obliges the
traveller occasionally to abandon the vicinity of the river, and make a wide sweep into the
interior.

<p> It was now far in the month of July, and the party suffered extremely from sultry weather
and dusty
travelling. The flies and gnats, too, were extremely troublesome to the horses; especially when
keeping along the edge of the river where it runs between low sand-banks.  Whenever the
travellers
encamped in the afternoon, the horses retired to the gravelly shores and remained there, without
attempting to feed until the cool of the evening.  As to the travellers, they plunged into the clear
and
cool current, to wash away the dust of the road and refresh themselves after the heat of the day. 
The
nights were always cool and pleasant.

<p> At one place where they encamped for some time, the river was nearly five hundred yards
wide, and
studded with grassy islands, adorned with groves of willow and cotton-wood. Here the Indians
were
assembled in great numbers, and had barricaded the channels between the islands, to enable them
to spear the salmon with greater facility. They were a timid race, and seemed unaccustomed to
the
sight of white men. Entering one of the huts, Captain Bonneville found the inhabitants just
proceeding to cook a fine salmon.  It is put into a pot filled with cold water, and hung over the
fire.
The moment the water begins to boil, the fish is considered cooked.

<p>  Taking his seat unceremoniously, and lighting his pipe, the captain awaited the cooking
of the
fish, intending to invite himself to the repast. The owner of the hut seemed to take his intrusion
in
good part.  While conversing with him the captain felt something move behind him, and turning
round and removing a few skins and old buffalo robes, discovered a young girl, about fourteen
years
of age, crouched beneath, who directed her large black eyes full in his face, and continued to
gaze
in mute surprise and terror. The captain endeavored to dispel her fears, and drawing a bright
ribbon
from his pocket, attempted repeatedly to tie it round her neck.  She jerked back at each attempt,
uttering a sound very much like a snarl; nor could all the blandishments of the captain, albeit a
pleasant, good-looking, and somewhat gallant man, succeed in conquering the shyness of the
savage little
beauty. His attentions were now turned toward the parents, whom he presented with an awl and a
little tobacco, and having thus secured their good-will, continued to smoke his pipe, and watch
the
salmon. While thus seated near the threshold, an urchin of the family approached the door, but
catching a sight of the strange guest, ran off screaming with terror and ensconced himself behind
the
long straw at the back of the hut.

<p> Desirous to dispel entirely this timidity, and to open a trade with the simple inhabitants of
the hut,
who, he did not doubt, had furs somewhere concealed, the captain now drew forth that grand lure
in the eyes of a savage, a pocket mirror. The sight of it was irresistible. After examining it for a
long
time with wonder and admiration, they produced a musk-rat skin, and offered it in exchange. 
The
captain shook his head; but purchased the skin for a couple of buttons - superfluous trinkets! as
the
worthy lord of the hovel had neither coat nor breeches on which to place them.

<p> The mirror still continued the great object of desire, particularly in the eyes of the old
housewife,
who produced a pot of parched flour and a string of biscuit roots. These procured her some trifle
in
return; but could not command the purchase of the mirror. The salmon being now completely
cooked, they all joined heartily in supper. A bounteous portion was deposited before the captain
by
the old woman, upon some fresh grass, which served instead of a platter; and never had he tasted
a
salmon boiled so completely to his fancy.

<p> Supper being over, the captain lighted his pipe and passed it to his host, who, inhaling the
smoke,
puffed it through his nostrils so assiduously, that in a little while his head manifested signs of
confusion and dizziness.  Being satisfied, by this time, of the kindly and companionable qualities
of the captain, he became easy and communicative; and at length hinted something about
exchanging
beaver skins for horses. The captain at once offered to dispose of his steed, which stood fastened
at
the door. The bargain was soon concluded, whereupon the Indian, removing a pile of bushes
under
which his valuables were concealed, drew forth the number of skins agreed upon as the price.

<p> Shortly afterward, some of the captain's people coming up, he ordered another horse to be
saddled,
and, mounting it, took his departure from the hut, after distributing a few trifling presents among
its
simple inhabitants. During all the time of his visit, the little Indian girl had kept her large black
eyes
fixed upon him, almost without winking, watching every movement with awe and wonder; and
as
he rode off, remained gazing after him, motionless as a statue. Her father, however, delighted
with
his new acquaintance, mounted his newly purchased horse, and followed in the train of the
captain,
to whom he continued to be a faithful and useful adherent during his sojourn in the
neighborhood.

<p> The cowardly effects of an evil conscience were evidenced in the conduct of one of the
captain's
men, who had been in the California expedition.  During all their intercourse with the harmless
people of this place, he had manifested uneasiness and anxiety.  While his companions mingled
freely and joyously with the natives, he went about with a restless, suspicious look; scrutinizing
every painted form and face and starting often at the sudden approach of some meek and
inoffensive
savage, who regarded him with reverence as a superior being. Yet this was ordinarily a bold
fellow,
who never flinched from danger, nor turned pale at the prospect of a battle. At length he
requested
permission of Captain Bonneville to keep out of the way of these people entirely. Their striking
resemblance, he said, to the people of Ogden's River, made him continually fear that some
among
them might have seen him in that expedition; and might seek an opportunity of revenge. Ever
after
this, while they remained in this neighborhood, he would skulk out of the way and keep aloof
when
any of the native inhabitants approached. "Such," observed Captain Bonneville, "is the effect of
self-reproach, even upon the roving trapper in the wilderness, who has little else to fear than the
stings
of his own guilty conscience."
