<p>AS the route of Captain Bonneville lay through what was considered the most perilous part
of this
region of dangers, he took all his measures with military skill, and observed the strictest
circumspection. When on the march, a small scouting party was thrown in the advance to
reconnoitre the country through which they were to pass. The encampments were selected with
great care, and a watch was kept up night and day. The horses were brought in and picketed at
night, and at daybreak a party was sent out to scour the neighborhood for half a mile round,
beating up every grove and thicket that could give shelter to a lurking foe. When all was reported
safe, the horses were cast loose and turned out to graze. Were such precautions generally
observed
by traders and hunters, we should not so often hear of parties being surprised by the Indians.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Having stated the military arrangements of the captain, we may here mention a mode of
defence on the open prairie,
which we have heard from a veteran in the Indian trade.  When a party of trappers is on a journey
with a convoy of goods
or peltries, every man has three pack-horses under his care; each horse laden with three packs. 
Every man is provided with
a picket with an iron head, a mallet, and hobbles, or leathern fetters for the horses. The trappers
proceed across the prairie
in a long line; or sometimes three parallel lines, sufficiently distant from each other to prevent
the packs from interfering. 
At an alarm, when there is no covert at hand, the line wheels so as to bring the front to the rear
and form a circle. All then
dismount, drive their pickets into the ground in the centre, fasten the horses to them, and hobble
their forelegs, so that,
in case of alarm, they cannot break away. Then they unload them, and dispose of their packs as
breastworks on the
periphery of the circle; each man having nine packs behind which to shelter himself. In this
promptly-formed fortress,
they await the assault of the enemy, and are enabled to set large bands of Indians at defiance.

<p>The first night of his march, Captain Bonneville encamped upon Henry's Fork;
an upper branch of Snake River, called after the first American trader that erected
a fort beyond the mountains. About an hour after all hands had come to a halt the
clatter of hoofs was heard, and a solitary female, of the Nez Perce tribe, came
galloping up. She was mounted on a mustang or half wild horse, which she
managed by a long rope hitched round the under jaw by way of bridle. 
Dismounting, she walked silently into the midst of the camp, and there seated
herself on the ground, still holding her horse by the long halter.

<p>The sudden and lonely apparition of this woman, and her calm yet resolute
demeanor, awakened universal curiosity. The hunters and trappers gathered round,
and gazed on her as something mysterious. She remained silent, but maintained
her air of calmness and self-possession. Captain Bonneville approached and
interrogated her as to the object of her mysterious visit. Her answer was brief but
earnest -- "I love the whites -- I will go with them." She was forthwith invited to a
lodge, of which she readily took possession, and from that time forward was
considered one of the camp.

<p>In consequence, very probably, of the military precautions of Captain
Bonneville, he conducted his party in safety through this hazardous region. No
accident of a disastrous kind occurred, excepting the loss of a horse, which, in
passing along the giddy edge of a precipice, called the Cornice, a dangerous pass
between Jackson's and Pierre's Hole, fell over the brink, and was dashed to pieces.

<p>On the 13th of July (1833), Captain Bonneville arrived at Green River. As he
entered the valley, he beheld it strewed in every direction with the carcasses of
buffaloes. It was evident that Indians had recently been there, and in great
numbers. Alarmed at this sight, he came to a halt, and as soon as it was dark, sent
out spies to his place of rendezvous on Horse Creek, where he had expected to
meet with his detached parties of trappers on the following day. Early in the
morning the spies made their appearance in the camp, and with them came three
trappers of one of his bands, from the rendezvous, who told him his people were
all there expecting him. As to the slaughter among the buffaloes, it had been made
by a friendly band of Shoshonies, who had fallen in with one of his trapping
parties, and accompanied them to the rendezvous. Having imparted this
intelligence, the three worthies from the rendezvous broached a small keg of
"alcohol," which they had brought with them. to enliven this merry meeting. The
liquor went briskly round; all absent friends were toasted, and the party moved
forward to the rendezvous in high spirits.

<p>The meeting of associated bands, who have been separated from each other on
these hazardous enterprises, is always interesting; each having its tales of perils
and adventures to relate.  Such was the case with the various detachments of
Captain Bonneville's company, thus brought together on Horse Creek.  Here was
the detachment of fifty men which he had sent from Salmon River, in the
preceding month of November, to winter on Snake River. They had met with
many crosses and losses in the course of their spring hunt, not so much from
Indians as from white men.  They had come in competition with rival trapping
parties, particularly one belonging to the Rocky Mountain Fur Company; and they
had long stories to relate of their manoeuvres to forestall or distress each other. In
fact, in these virulent and sordid competitions, the trappers of each party were
more intent upon injuring their rivals, than benefitting themselves; breaking each
other's traps, trampling and tearing to pieces the beaver lodges, and doing every
thing in their power to mar the success of the hunt. We forbear to detail these
pitiful contentions.

<p>The most lamentable tale of disasters, however, that Captain Bonneville had to
hear, was from a partisan, whom he had detached in the preceding year, with
twenty men, to hunt through the outskirts of the Crow country, and on the tributary streams of
the Yellowstone; whence he was to proceed and join him in his
winter quarters on Salmon River.  This partisan appeared at the rendezvous
without his party, and a sorrowful tale of disasters had he to relate.  In hunting the
Crow country, he fell in with a village of that tribe; notorious rogues,  jockeys,
and horse stealers, and errant scamperers of the mountains. These decoyed most of
his men to desert, and carry off horses, traps, and accoutrements. When he
attempted to retake the deserters, the Crow warriors ruffled up to him and declared
the deserters were their good friends, had determined to remain among them, and
should not be molested. The poor partisan, therefore, was fain to leave his
vagabonds among these birds of their own feather, and being too weak in numbers
to attempt the dangerous pass across the mountains to meet Captain Bonneville on
Salmon River, he made, with the few that remained faithful to him, for the
neighborhood of Tullock's Fort, on the Yellowstone, under the protection of which
he went into winter quarters.

<p>He soon found out that the neighborhood of the fort was nearly as bad as the
neighborhood of the Crows. His men were continually stealing away thither, with
whatever beaver skins they could secrete or lay their hands on. These they would
exchange with the hangers-on of the fort for whiskey, and then revel in drunkeness
and debauchery.

<p>The unlucky partisan made another move. Associating with his party a few free
trappers, whom he met with in this neighborhood, he started off early in the spring
to trap on the head waters of Powder River.  In the course of the journey, his
horses were so much jaded in traversing a steep mountain, that he was induced to
turn them loose to graze during the night. The place was lonely; the path was
rugged; there was not the sign of an Indian in the neighborhood; not a blade of
grass that had been turned by a footstep. But who can calculate on security in the
midst of the Indian country, where the foe lurks in silence and secrecy, and seems
to come and go on the wings of the wind? The horses had scarce been turned
loose, when a couple of Arickara (or Rickaree) warriors entered the camp. They
affected a frank and friendly demeanor; but their appearance and movements
awakened the suspicions of some of the veteran trappers, well versed in Indian
wiles. Convinced that they were spies sent on some sinister errand, they took them
in custody, and set to work to drive in the horses. It was too late -- the horses were
already gone. In fact, a war party of Arickaras had been hovering on their trail for
several days, watching with the patience and perseverance of Indians, for some
moment of negligence and fancied security, to make a successful swoop. The two
spies had evidently been sent into the camp to create a diversion, while their
confederates carried off the spoil.

<p>The unlucky partisan, thus robbed of his horses, turned furiously on his
prisoners, ordered them to be bound hand and foot, and swore to put them to death
unless his property were restored. The robbers, who soon found that their spies
were in captivity, now made their appearance on horseback, and held a parley. The
sight of them, mounted on the very horses they had stolen, set the blood of the
mountaineers in a ferment; but it was useless to attack them, as they would have
but to turn their steeds and scamper out of the reach of pedestrians. A negotiation
was now attempted. The Arickaras offered what they considered fair terms; to
barter one horse, or even two horses, for a prisoner. The mountaineers spurned at
their offer, and declared that, unless all the horses were relinquished, the prisoners
should be burnt to death. To give force to their threat, a pyre of logs and fagots
was heaped up and kindled into a blaze.

<p>The parley continued; the Arickaras released one horse and then another, in
earnest of their proposition; finding, however, that nothing short of the
relinquishment of all their spoils would purchase the lives of the captives, they
abandoned them to their fate, moving off with many parting words and lamentable
howlings. The prisoners seeing them depart, and knowing the horrible fate that
awaited them, made a desperate effort to escape. They partially succeeded, but
were severely wounded and retaken; then dragged to the blazing pyre, and burnt to
death in the sight of their retreating comrades.

<p>Such are the savage cruelties that white men learn to practise, who mingle in
savage life; and such are the acts that lead to terrible recrimination on the part of
the Indians. Should we hear of any atrocities committed by the Arickaras upon
captive white men, let this signal and recent provocation be borne in mind.
Individual cases of the kind dwell in the recollections of whole tribes; and it is a
point of honor and conscience to revenge them.

<p>The loss of his horses completed the ruin of the unlucky partisan. It was out of
his power to prosecute his hunting, or to maintain his party; the only thought now
was how to get back to civilized life. At the first water-course, his men built
canoes, and committed themselves to the stream. Some engaged themselves at
various trading establishments at which they touched, others got back to the
settlements. As to the partisan, he found an opportunity to make his way to the
rendezvous at Green River Valley; which he reached in time to render to Captain
Bonneville this forlorn account of his misadventures.
