<p>FOR the greater part of the month of November Captain Bonneville remained in his
temporary post
on Salmon River. He was now in the full enjoyment of his wishes; leading a hunter's life in the
heart
of the wilderness, with all its wild populace around him. Beside his own people, motley in
character
and costume--creole, Kentuckian, Indian, half-breed, hired trapper, and free trapper--he was
surrounded by encampments of Nez Perces and Flatheads, with their droves of horses covering
the
hills and plains. It was, he declares, a wild and bustling scene. The hunting parties of white men
and
red men, continually sallying forth and returning; the groups at the various encampments, some
cooking, some working, some amusing themselves at different games; the neighing of horses, the
braying of asses, the resounding strokes of the axe, the sharp report of the rifle, the whoop, the
halloo, and the frequent burst of laughter, all in the midst of a region suddenly roused from
perfect
silence and loneliness by this transient hunters' sojourn, realized, he says, the idea of a "populous
solitude."

<p>The kind and genial character of the captain had, evidently, its influence on the opposite
races thus
fortuitously congregated together. The most perfect harmony prevailed between them. The
Indians,
he says, were friendly in their dispositions, and honest to the most scrupulous degree in their
intercourse with the white men. It is true they were somewhat importunate in their curiosity, and
apt
to be continually in the way, examining everything with keen and prying eye, and watching
every
movement of the white men. All this, however, was borne with great good-humor by the captain,
and
through his example by his men. Indeed, throughout all his transactions he shows himself the
friend
of the poor Indians, and his conduct toward them is above all praise.

<p>The Nez Perces, the Flatheads, and the Hanging-ears pride themselves upon the number of
their
horses, of which they possess more in proportion than any other of the mountain tribes within the
buffalo range.  Many of the Indian warriors and hunters encamped around Captain Bonneville
possess from thirty to forty horses each. Their horses are stout, well-built ponies, of great wind,
and
capable of enduring the severest hardship and fatigue. The swiftest of them, however, are those
obtained from the whites while sufficiently young to become acclimated and inured to the rough
service of the mountains.

<p>By degrees the populousness of this encampment began to produce its inconveniences.  The
immense droves of horses owned by the Indians consumed the herbage of the surrounding hills;
while to drive them to any distant pasturage, in a neighborhood abounding with lurking and
deadly
enemies, would be to endanger the loss both of man and beast. Game, too, began to grow scarce.
It
was soon hunted and frightened out of the vicinity, and though the Indians made a wide circuit
through the mountains in the hope of driving the buffalo toward the cantonment, their expedition
was
unsuccessful. It was plain that so large a party could not subsist themselves there, nor in any one
place throughout the winter. Captain Bonneville, therefore, altered his whole arrangements. He
detached fifty men toward the south to winter upon Snake River, and to trap about its waters in
the
spring, with orders to rejoin him in the month of July at Horse Creek, in Green River Valley,
which
he had fixed upon as the general rendezvous of his company for the ensuing year.

<p>  Of all his late party, he now retained with him merely a small number of free trappers,
with
whom he intended to sojourn among the Nez Perces and Flatheads, and adopt the Indian mode of
moving with the game and grass. Those bands, in effect, shortly afterward broke up their
encampments and set off for a less beaten neighborhood. Captain Bonneville remained behind
for
a few days, that he might secretly prepare <em>caches, </em>in which to deposit everything not
required for
current use. Thus lightened of all superfluous encumbrance, he set off on the 20th of November
to
rejoin his Indian allies. He found them encamped in a secluded part of the country, at the head of
a
small stream. Considering themselves out of all danger in this sequestered spot from their old
enemies, the Blackfeet, their encampment manifested the most negligent security. Their lodges
were
scattered in every direction, and their horses covered every hill for a great distance round,
grazing
upon the upland bunch grass which grew in great abundance, and though dry, retained its
nutritious
properties instead of losing them like other grasses in the autumn.

<p>  When the Nez Perces, Flatheads, and Pends Oreilles are encamped in a dangerous
neighborhood, says Captain Bonneville, the greatest care is taken of their horses, those prime
articles
of Indian wealth, and objects of Indian depredation.  Each warrior has his horse tied by one foot
at
night to a stake planted before his lodge. Here they remain until broad daylight; by that time the
young men of the camp are already ranging over the surrounding hills. Each family then drives
its
horses to some eligible spot, where they are left to graze unattended. A young Indian repairs
occasionally to the pasture to give them water, and to see that all is well. So accustomed are the
horses to this management, that they keep together in the pasture where they have been left. As
the
sun sinks behind the hills, they may be seen moving from all points toward the camp, where they
surrender themselves to be tied up for the night. Even in situations of danger, the Indians rarely
set
guards over their camp at night, intrusting that office entirely to their vigilant and well-trained
dogs.

<p>  In an encampment, however, of such fancied security as that in which Captain Bonneville
found his Indian friends, much of these precautions with respect to their horses are omitted. They
merely drive them, at nightfall, to some sequestered little dell, and leave them there, at perfect
liberty, until the morning.

<p>  One object of Captain Bonneville in wintering among these Indians was to procure a
supply
of horses against the spring. They were, however, extremely unwilling to part with any, and it
was
with great difficulty that he purchased, at the rate of twenty dollars each, a few for the use of
some
of his free trappers who were on foot and dependent on him for their equipment.

<p>  In this encampment Captain Bonneville remained from the 21st of November to the 9th
of
December. During this period the thermometer ranged from thirteen to forty-two degrees. There
were occasional falls of snow; but it generally melted away almost immediately, and the tender
blades of new grass began to shoot up among the old. On the 7th of December, however, the
thermometer fell to seven degrees.

<p>  The reader will recollect that, on distributing his forces when in Green River Valley,
Captain
Bonneville had detached a party, headed by a leader of the name of Matthieu, with all the weak
and
disabled horses, to sojourn about Bear River, meet the Shoshonie bands, and afterward to rejoin
him
at his winter camp on Salmon River.

<p>     More than sufficient time had elapsed, yet Matthieu failed to make his appearance, and
uneasiness
began to be felt on his account. Captain Bonneville sent out four men, to range the country
through
which he would have to pass, and endeavor to get some information concerning him; for his
route
lay across the great Snake River plain, which spreads itself out like an Arabian desert, and on
which
a cavalcade could be descried at a great distance. The scouts soon returned, having proceeded no
further than the edge of the plain, pretending that their horses were lame; but it was evident they
had
feared to venture, with so small a force, into these exposed and dangerous regions.

<p>  A disease, which Captain Bonneville supposed to be pneumonia, now appeared among
the
Indians, carrying off numbers of them after an illness of three or four days. The worthy captain
acted
as physician, prescribing profuse sweatings and copious bleedings, and uniformly with success,
if
the patient were subsequently treated with proper care. In extraordinary cases, the poor savages
called in the aid of their own doctors or conjurors, who officiated with great noise and mummery,
but with little benefit. Those who died during this epidemic were buried in graves, after the
manner
of the whites, but without any regard to the direction of the head. It is a fact worthy of notice
that,
while this malady made such ravages among the natives, not a single white man had the slightest
symptom of it.

<p>  A familiar intercourse of some standing with the Pierced-nose and Flathead Indians had
now
convinced Captain Bonneville of their amicable and inoffensive character; he began to take a
strong
interest in them, and conceived the idea of becoming a pacificator, and healing the deadly feud
between them and the Blackfeet, in which they were so deplorably the sufferers. He proposed the
matter to some of the leaders, and urged that they should meet the Blackfeet chiefs in a grand
pacific
conference, offering to send two of his men to the enemy's camp with pipe, tobacco and flag of
truce,
to negotiate the proposed meeting.

<p>  The Nez Perces and Flathead sages upon this held a council of war of two days' duration,
in
which there was abundance of hard smoking and long talking, and both eloquence and tobacco
were
nearly exhausted. At length they came to a decision to reject the worthy captain's proposition,
and
upon pretty substantial grounds, as the reader may judge.

<p>  "War," said the chiefs, "is a bloody business, and full of evil; but it keeps the eyes of the
chiefs always open, and makes the limbs of the young men strong and supple. In war, every one
is
on the alert. If we see a trail we know it must be an enemy; if the Blackfeet come to us, we know
it
is for war, and we are ready. Peace, on the other hand, sounds no alarm; the eyes of the chiefs are
closed in sleep, and the young men are sleek and lazy. The horses stray into the mountains; the
women and their little babes go about alone. But the heart of a Blackfoot is a lie, and his tongue
is
a trap. If he says peace it is to deceive; he comes to us as a brother; he smokes his pipe with us;
but
when he sees us weak, and off our guard, he will slay and steal. We will have no such peace; let
there
be war!"

<p>  With this reasoning Captain Bonneville was fain to acquiesce; but, since the sagacious
Flatheads and their allies were content to remain in a state of warfare, he wished them at least to
exercise the boasted vigilance which war was to produce, and to keep their eyes open. He
represented to them the impossibility that two such considerable clans could move about the
country
without leaving trails by which they might be traced. Besides, among the Blackfeet braves were
several Nez Perces, who had been taken prisoners in early youth, adopted by their captors, and
trained up and imbued with warlike and predatory notions; these had lost all sympathies with
their
native tribe, and would be prone to lead the enemy to their secret haunts. He exhorted them,
therefore, to keep upon the alert, and never to remit their vigilance while within the range of so
crafty
and cruel a foe. All these counsels were lost upon his easy and simple-minded hearers. A careless
indifference reigned throughout their encampments, and their horses were permitted to range the
hills at night in perfect freedom. Captain Bonneville had his own horses brought in at night, and
properly picketed and guarded. The evil he apprehended soon took place. In a single night a
swoop
was made through the neighboring pastures by the Blackfeet, and eighty-six of the finest horses
carried off. A whip and a rope were left in a conspicuous situation by the robbers, as a taunt to
the
simpletons they had unhorsed.

<p>  Long before sunrise the news of this calamity spread like wildfire through the different
encampments. Captain Bonneville, whose own horses remained safe at their pickets, watched in
momentary expectation of an outbreak of warriors, Pierced-nose and Flathead, in furious pursuit
of
the marauders; but no such thing -- they contented themselves with searching diligently over hill
and
dale, to glean up such horses as had escaped the hands of the marauders, and then resigned
themselves to their loss with the most exemplary quiescence.

<p>  Some, it is true, who were entirely unhorsed, set out on a begging visit to their cousins, as
they called them, the Lower Nez Perces, who inhabit the lower country about the Columbia, and
possess horses in abundance. To these they repair when in difficulty, and seldom fail, by dint of
begging and bartering, to get themselves once more mounted on horseback.

<p>  Game had now become scarce in the neighborhood of the camp, and it was necessary,
according to Indian custom, to move off to a less beaten ground.  Captain Bonneville proposed
the
Horse Prairie; but his Indian friends objected that many of the Nez Perces had gone to visit their
cousins, and that the whites were few in number, so that their united force was not sufficient to
Venture upon the buffalo grounds, which were infested by bands of Blackfeet.

<p>  They now spoke of a place at no great distance, which they represented as a perfect
hunter's
elysium. It was on the right branch, or head stream of the river, locked up among cliffs and
precipices where there was no danger from roving bands, and where the Blackfeet dare not enter.
Here, they said, the elk abounded, and the mountain sheep were to be seen trooping upon the
rocks
and hills.  A little distance beyond it, also, herds of buffalo were to be met with, Out of range of
danger. Thither they proposed to move their camp.

<p>  The proposition pleased the captain, who was desirous, through the Indians, of becoming
acquainted with all the secret places of the land. Accordingly, on the 9th of December, they
struck
their tents, and moved forward by short stages, as many of the Indians were yet feeble from the
late
malady.

<p>  Following up the right fork of the river they came to where it entered a deep gorge of the
mountains, up which lay the secluded region so much valued by the Indians. Captain Bonneville
halted and encamped for three days before entering the gorge. In the meantime he detached five
of
his free trappers to scour the hills, and kill as many elk as possible, before the main body should
enter, as they would then be soon frightened away by the various Indian hunting parties.

<p>  While thus encamped, they were still liable to the marauds of the Blackfeet, and Captain
Bonneville admonished his Indian friends to be upon their guard. The Nez Perces, however,
notwithstanding their recent loss, were still careless of their horses; merely driving them to some
secluded spot, and leaving them there for the night, without setting any guard upon them. The
consequence was a second swoop, in which forty-one were carried off. This was borne with
equal
philosophy with the first, and no effort was made either to recover the horses, or to take
vengeance
on the thieves.

<p>  The Nez Perces, however, grew more cautious with respect to their remaining horses,
driving
them regularly to the camp every evening, and fastening them to pickets. Captain Bonneville,
however, told them that this was not enough. It was evident they were dogged by a daring and
persevering enemy, who was encouraged by past impunity; they should, therefore, take more
than
usual precautions, and post a guard at night over their cavalry. They could not, however, be
persuaded to depart from their usual custom. The horse once picketed, the care of the owner was
over
for the night, and he slept profoundly. None waked in the camp but the gamblers, who, absorbed
in
their play, were more difficult to be roused to external circumstances than even the sleepers.

<p>  The Blackfeet are bold enemies, and fond of hazardous exploits. The band that were
hovering
about the neighborhood, finding that they had such pacific people to deal with, redoubled their
daring. The horses being now picketed before the lodges, a number of Blackfeet scouts
penetrated
in the early part of the night into the very centre of the camp. Here they went about among the
lodges
as calmly and deliberately as if at home, quietly cutting loose the horses that stood picketed by
the
lodges of their sleeping owners. One of these prowlers, more adventurous than the rest,
approached
a fire round which a group of Nez Perces were gambling with the most intense eagerness. Here
he
stood for some time, muffled up in his robe, peering over the shoulders of the players, watching
the
changes of their countenances and the fluctuations of the game. So completely engrossed were
they,
that the presence of this muffled eaves-dropper was unnoticed and, having executed his bravado,
he
retired undiscovered.

<p>  Having cut loose as many horses as they could conveniently carry off, the Blackfeet
scouts
rejoined their comrades, and all remained patiently round the camp. By degrees the horses,
finding
themselves at liberty, took their route toward their customary grazing ground. As they emerged
from
the camp they were silently taken possession of, until, having secured about thirty, the Blackfeet
sprang on their backs and scampered off. The clatter of hoofs startled the gamblers from their
game.
They gave the alarm, which soon roused the sleepers from every lodge. Still all was quiescent; no
marshalling of forces, no saddling of steeds and dashing off in pursuit, no talk of retribution for
their
repeated outrages. The patience of Captain Bonneville was at length exhausted. He had played
the
part of a pacificator without success; he now altered his tone, and resolved, if possible, to rouse
their
war spirit.

<p>  Accordingly, convoking their chiefs, he inveighed against their craven policy, and urged
the
necessity of vigorous and retributive measures that would check the confidence and presumption
of
their enemies, if not inspire them with awe. For this purpose, he advised that a war party should
be
immediately sent off on the trail of the marauders, to follow them, if necessary, into the very
heart
of the Blackfoot country, and not to leave them until they had taken signal vengeance. Beside
this,
he recommended the organization of minor war parties, to make reprisals to the extent of the
losses
sustained. "Unless you rouse yourselves from your apathy," said he, "and strike some bold and
decisive blow, you will cease to be considered men, or objects of manly warfare. The very
squaws
and children of the Blackfeet will be set against you, while their warriors reserve themselves for
nobler antagonists."

<p>  This harangue had evidently a momentary effect upon the pride of the hearers. After a
short
pause, however, one of the orators arose. It was bad, he said, to go to war for mere revenge.  The
Great Spirit had given them a heart for peace, not for war. They had lost horses, it was true, but
they
could easily get others from their cousins, the Lower Nez Perces, without incurring any risk;
whereas, in war they should lose men, who were not so readily replaced. As to their late losses,
an
increased watchfulness would prevent any more misfortunes of the kind. He disapproved,
therefore,
of all hostile measures; and all the other chiefs concurred in his opinion.

<p>  Captain Bonneville again took up the point. "It is true," said he, "the Great Spirit has
given
you a heart to love your friends; but he has also given you an arm to strike your enemies. Unless
you
do something speedily to put an end to this continual plundering, I must say farewell. As yet I
have
sustained no loss; thanks to the precautions which you have slighted; but my property is too
unsafe
here; my turn will come next; I and my people will share the contempt you are bringing upon
yourselves, and will be thought, like you, poor-spirited beings, who may at any time be
plundered with
impunity."

<p>  The conference broke up with some signs of excitement on the part of the Indians. Early
the
next morning, a party of thirty men set off in pursuit of the foe, and Captain Bonneville hoped to
hear a good account of the Blackfeet marauders. To his disappointment, the war party came
lagging
back on the following day, leading a few old, sorry, broken-down horses, which the free-booters
had
not been able to urge to sufficient speed. This effort exhausted the martial spirit, and satisfied the
wounded pride of the Nez Perces, and they relapsed into their usual state of passive indifference.
