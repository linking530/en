<p>THE GREEN RIVER VALLEY was at this time the scene of one of those general
gatherings of traders, trappers, and Indians, that we have already mentioned. The three
rival companies, which, for a year past had been endeavoring to out-trade, out-trap and
out-wit each other, were here encamped in close proximity, awaiting their annual
supplies. About four miles from the rendezvous of Captain Bonneville was that of the
American Fur Company, hard by which, was that also of the Rocky Mountain Fur
Company.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>After the eager rivalry and almost hostility displayed by these companies in their late
campaigns, it might be expected that, when thus brought in juxtaposition, they would
hold themselves warily and sternly aloof from each other, and, should they happen to
come in contact, brawl and bloodshed would ensue.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>No such thing! Never did rival lawyers, after a wrangle at the bar, meet with more social
good humor at a circuit dinner. The hunting season over, all past tricks and maneuvres
are forgotten, all feuds and bickerings buried in oblivion. From the middle of June to the
middle of September, all trapping is suspended; for the beavers are then shedding their
furs and their skins are of little value. This, then, is the trapper's holiday, when he is all
for fun and frolic, and ready for a saturnalia among the mountains.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>At the present season, too, all parties were in good humor. The year had been
productive. Competition, by threatening to lessen their profits, had quickened their wits,
roused their energies, and made them turn every favorable chance to the best
advantage; so that, on assembling at their respective places of rendezvous, each
company found itself in possession of a rich stock of peltries.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The leaders of the different companies, therefore, mingled on terms of perfect good
fellowship; interchanging visits, and regaling each other in the best style their
respective camps afforded. But the rich treat for the worthy captain was to see the
"chivalry" of the various encampments, engaged in contests of skill at running, jumping,
wrestling, shooting with the rifle, and running horses. And then their rough hunters'
feastings and carousels. They drank together, they sang, they laughed, they whooped;
they tried to out-brag and out-lie each other in stories of their adventures and
achievements. Here the free trappers were in all their glory; they considered
themselves the "cocks of the walk," and always carried the highest crests. Now and
then familiarity was pushed too far, and would effervesce into a brawl, and a "rough
and tumble" fight; but it all ended in cordial reconciliation and maudlin endearment.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The presence of the Shoshonie tribe contributed occasionally to cause temporary
jealousies and feuds. The Shoshonie beauties became objects of rivalry among some
of the amorous mountaineers. Happy was the trapper who could muster up a red
blanket, a string of gay beads, or a paper of precious vermilion, with which to win the
smiles of a Shoshonie fair one.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The caravans of supplies arrived at the valley just at this period of gallantry and good
fellowship. Now commenced a scene of eager competition and wild prodigality at the
different encampments. Bales were hastily ripped open, and their motley contents
poured forth. A mania for purchasing spread itself throughout the several
bands--munitions for war, for hunting, for gallantry, were seized upon with equal
avidity--rifles, hunting knives, traps, scarlet cloth, red blankets, garish beads, and
glittering trinkets, were bought at any price, and scores run up without any thought how
they were ever to be rubbed off. The free trappers, especially, were extravagant in their
purchases. For a free mountaineer to pause at a paltry consideration of dollars and
cents, in the attainment of any object that might strike his fancy, would stamp him with
the mark of the beast in the estimation of his comrades. For a trader to refuse one of
these free and flourishing blades a credit, whatever unpaid scores might stare him in
the face, would be a flagrant affront scarcely to be forgiven.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Now succeeded another outbreak of revelry and extravagance. The trappers were
newly fitted out and arrayed, and dashed about with their horses caparisoned in Indian
style. The Shoshonie beauties also flaunted about in all the colors of the rainbow.
Every freak of prodigality was indulged to its fullest extent, and in a little while most of
the trappers, having squandered away all their wages, and perhaps run knee-deep in
debt, were ready for another hard campaign in the wilderness.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>During this season of folly and frolic, there was an alarm of mad wolves in the two lower
camps. One or more of these animals entered the camps for three nights successively,
and bit several of the people.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Captain Bonneville relates the case of an Indian, who was a universal favorite in the
lower camp. He had been bitten by one of these animals. Being out with a party shortly
afterwards, he grew silent and gloomy, and lagged behind the rest as if he wished to
leave them. They halted and urged him to move faster, but he entreated them not to
approach him, and, leaping from his horse, began to roll frantically on the earth,
gnashing his teeth and foaming at the mouth. Still he retained his senses, and warned
his companions not to come near him, as he should not be able to restrain himself from
biting them. They hurried off to obtain relief; but on their return he was nowhere to be
found. His horse and his accoutrements remained upon the spot. Three or four days
afterwards a solitary Indian, believed to be the same, was observed crossing a valley,
and pursued; but he darted away into the fastnesses of the mountains, and was seen
no more.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Another instance we have from a different person who was present in the encampment.
One of the men of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company had been bitten. He set out
shortly afterwards in company with two white men on his return to the settlements. In
the course of a few days he showed symptoms of hydrophobia, and became raving
toward night. At length, breaking away from his companions, he rushed into a thicket of
willows, where they left him to his fate!
