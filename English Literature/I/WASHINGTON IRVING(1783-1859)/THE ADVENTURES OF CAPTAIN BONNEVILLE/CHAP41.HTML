<h1>Washington Irving's<i>The Adventures of Captain Bonneville</i></h1>

<h2>Chapter 41</h2>
<i>A voyage in a bull boat.</i>
</center>

<p> IT was about the middle of August (1833) that Mr. Nathaniel J. Wyeth, as the reader may
recollect, launched his bull boat at the foot of the rapids of the Bighorn, and departed in advance
of the parties of Campbell and Captain Bonneville. His boat was made of three buffalo skins,
stretched on a  light frame, stitched together, and the seams paid with elk tallow and ashes.  It
was eighteen feet long, and about five feet six inches wide, sharp at each end, with a round
bottom, and drew about a foot and a half of water-a depth too great for these upper rivers, which
abound with shallows and sand-bars. The crew consisted of two half-breeds, who claimed to be
white men, though a mixture of the French creole and the Shawnee and Potawattomie.  They
claimed, moreover, to be thorough mountaineers, and first-rate hunters --  the common boast of
these vagabonds of the wilderness.  Besides these, there was a Nez Perce lad of eighteen years of
age, a kind of servant of all work, whose great aim, like all Indian servants, was to do as little
work as possible; there was, moreover, a half-breed boy, of thirteen, named Baptiste, son of a
Hudson's Bay trader by a Flathead beauty; who was travelling with Wyeth to see the world and
complete his education.  Add to these, Mr. Milton Sublette, who went as passenger, and we have
the crew of the little bull boat complete.

<p> It certainly was a slight armament with which to run the gauntlet through countries
swarming with
hostile hordes, and a slight bark to navigate these endless rivers, tossing and pitching down
rapids,
running on snags and bumping on sand-bars; such, however, are the cockle-shells with which
these
hardy rovers of the wilderness will attempt the wildest streams; and it is surprising what rough
shocks and thumps these boats will endure, and what vicissitudes they will live through. Their
duration, however, is but limited; they require frequently to be hauled out of the water and dried,
to
prevent the hides from becoming water-soaked; and they eventually rot and go to pieces.

<p> The course of the river was a little to the north of east; it ran about five miles an hour, over a
gravelly
bottom. The banks were generally alluvial, and thickly grown with cottonwood trees,
intermingled
occasionally with ash and plum trees. Now and then limestone cliffs and promontories advanced
upon the river, making picturesque headlands. Beyond the woody borders rose ranges of naked
hills.

<p> Milton Sublette was the Pelorus of this adventurous bark; being somewhat experienced in
this wild
kind of navigation. It required all his attention and skill, however, to pilot her clear of sand-bars
and
snags of sunken trees. There was often, too, a perplexity of choice, where the river branched into
various channels, among clusters of islands; and occasionally the voyagers found themselves
aground
and had to turn back.

<p> It was necessary, also, to keep a wary eye upon the land, for they were passing through the
heart of
the Crow country, and were continually in reach of any ambush that might be lurking on shore. 
The
most formidable foes that they saw, however, were three grizzly bears, quietly promenading
along
the bank, who seemed to gaze at them with surprise as they glided by.  Herds of buffalo, also,
were
moving about, or lying on the ground, like cattle in a pasture; excepting such inhabitants as these,
a perfect solitude reigned over the land. There was no sign of human habitation; for the Crows,
as
we have already shown, are a wandering people, a race of hunters and warriors, who live in tents
and
on horseback, and are continually on the move.

<p> At night they landed, hauled up their boat to dry, pitched their tent, and made a rousing fire.
Then,
as it was the first evening of their voyage, they indulged in a regale, relishing their buffalo beef
with
inspiring alcohol; after which, they slept soundly, without dreaming of Crows or Blackfeet. Early
in the morning, they again launched the boat and committed themselves to the stream.

<p> In this way they voyaged for two days without any material occurrence, excepting a severe
thunder
storm, which compelled them to put to shore, and wait until it was passed. On the third morning
they
descried some persons at a distance on the river bank. As they were now, by calculation, at no
great
distance from Fort Cass, a trading post of the American Fur Company, they supposed these
might
be some of its people. A nearer approach showed them to be Indians. Descrying a woman apart
from
the rest, they landed and accosted her. She informed them that the main force of the Crow nation,
consisting of five bands, under their several chiefs, were but about two or three miles below, on
their
way up along the river. This was unpleasant tidings, but to retreat was impossible, and the river
afforded no hiding place. They continued forward, therefore, trusting that, as Fort Cass was so
near
at hand, the Crows might refrain from any depredations.

<p> Floating down about two miles further, they came in sight of the first band, scattered
along the river bank, all well mounted; some armed with guns, others with bows and
arrows, and a few with lances. They made a wildly picturesque appearance managing
their horses with their accustomed dexterity and grace. Nothing can be more spirited
than a band of Crow cavaliers. They are a fine race of men averaging six feet in
height, lithe and active, with hawks' eyes and Roman noses. The latter feature is
common to the Indians on the east side of the Rocky Mountains; those on the western
side have generally straight or flat noses.

<p> Wyeth would fain have slipped by this cavalcade unnoticed; but the river, at this place, was
not more
than ninety yards across; he was perceived, therefore, and hailed by the vagabond warriors, and,
we
presume, in no very choice language; for, among their other accomplishments, the Crows are
famed
for possessing a Billingsgate vocabulary of unrivalled opulence, and for being by no means
sparing
of it whenever an occasion offers. Indeed, though Indians are generally very lofty, rhetorical, and
figurative in their language at all great talks, and high ceremonials, yet, if trappers and traders
may
be believed, they are the most unsavory vagabonds in their ordinary colloquies; they make no
hesitation to call a spade a spade; and when they once undertake to call hard names, the famous
pot
and kettle, of vituperating memory, are not to be compared with them for scurrility of epithet.

<p> To escape the infliction of any compliments of this kind, or the launching, peradventure, of
more
dangerous missiles, Wyeth landed with the best grace in his power and approached the chief of
the
band. It was Arapooish, the quondam friend of Rose the outlaw, and one whom we have already
mentioned as being anxious to promote a friendly intercourse between his tribe and the white
men.
He was a tall, stout man, of good presence, and received the voyagers very graciously. His
people,
too, thronged around them, and were officiously attentive after the Crow fashion. One took a
great
fancy to Baptiste the Flathead boy, and a still greater fancy to a ring on his finger, which he
transposed to his own with surprising dexterity, and then disappeared with a quick step among
the
crowd.

<p> Another was no less pleased with the Nez Perce lad, and nothing would do but he must
exchange
knives with him; drawing a new knife out of the Nez Perce's scabbard, and putting an old one in
its
place. Another stepped up and replaced this old knife with one still older, and a third helped
himself
to knife, scabbard and all. It was with much difficulty that Wyeth and his companions extricated
themselves from the clutches of these officious Crows before they were entirely plucked.

<p> Falling down the river a little further, they came in sight of the second band, and sheered to
the
opposite side, with the intention of passing them. The Crows were not to be evaded. Some
pointed
their guns at the boat, and threatened to fire; others stripped, plunged into the stream, and came
swimming across. Making a virtue of necessity, Wyeth threw a cord to the first that came within
reach, as if he wished to be drawn to the shore.

<p> In this way he was overhauled by every band, and by the time he and his people came out of
the busy
hands of the last, they were eased of most of their superfluities. Nothing, in all probability, but
the
proximity of the American trading post, kept these land pirates from making a good prize of the
bull
boat and all its contents.

<p> These bands were in full march, equipped for war, and evidently full of mischief. They
were, in fact,
the very bands that overran the land in the autumn of 1833; partly robbed Fitzpatrick of his
horses
and effects; hunted and harassed Captain Bonneville and his people; broke up their trapping
campaigns, and, in a word, drove them all out of the Crow country. It has been suspected that
they were
set on to these pranks by some of the American Fur Company, anxious to defeat the plans of
their
rivals of the Rocky Mountain Company; for at this time, their competition was at its height, and
the
trade of the Crow country was a great object of rivalry. What makes this the more probable, is,
that
the Crows in their depredation seemed by no means bloodthirsty, but intent chiefly on robbing
the
parties of their traps and horses, thereby disabling them from prosecuting their hunting.

<p> We should observe that this year, the Rocky Mountain Company were pushing their way up
the
rivers, and establishing rival posts near those of the American Company; and that, at the very
time
of which we are speaking, Captain Sublette was ascending the Yellowstone with a keel boat,
laden
with supplies; so that there was every prospect of this eager rivalship being carried to extremes.

<p> The last band of Crow warriors had scarcely disappeared in the clouds of dust they had
raised, when
our voyagers arrived at the mouth of the river and glided into the current of the Yellowstone.
Turning down this stream, they made for Fort Cass, which is situated on the right bank, about
three
miles below the Bighorn. On the opposite side they beheld a party of thirty-one savages, which
they
soon ascertained to be Blackfeet. The width of the river enabled them to keep at a sufficient
distance,
and they soon landed at Fort Cass. This was a mere fortification against Indians; being a stockade
of about one hundred and thirty feet square, with two bastions at the extreme corners. M'Tulloch,
an agent of the American Company, was stationed there with twenty men; two boats of fifteen
tons
burden were lying here; but at certain seasons of the year a steamboat can come up to the fort.

<p> They had scarcely arrived, when the Blackfeet warriors made their appearance on the
opposite bank,
displaying two American flags in token of amity.  They plunged into the river, swam across, and
were kindly received at the fort. They were some of the very men who had been engaged, the
year
previously, in the battle at Pierre's Hole, and a fierce-looking set of fellows they were; tall and
hawk-nosed, and very much resembling the Crows. They professed to be on an amicable errand,
to make
peace with the Crows, and set off in all haste, before night, to overtake them. Wyeth predicted
that
they would lose their scalps; for he had heard the Crows denounce vengeance on them, for
having
murdered two of their warriors who had ventured among them on the faith of a treaty of peace. It
is
probable, however, that this pacific errand was all a pretence, and that the real object of the
Blackfeet
braves was to hang about the skirts of the Crow band, steal their horses, and take the scalps of
stragglers.

<p> At Fort Cass, Mr. Wyeth disposed of some packages of beaver, and a quantity of buffalo
robes. On
the following morning (August 18th), he once more launched his bull boat, and proceeded down
the
Yellowstone, which inclined in an east-northeast direction. The river had alluvial bottoms,
fringed
with great quantities of the sweet cotton-wood, and interrupted occasionally by "bluffs" of
sandstone.
The current occasionally brings down fragments of granite and porphyry.

<p> In the course of the day, they saw something moving on the bank among the trees, which
they
mistook for game of some kind; and, being in want of provisions, pulled toward shore. They
discovered, just in time, a party of Blackfeet, lurking in the thickets, and sheered, with all speed,
to
the opposite side of the river.

<p> After a time, they came in sight of a gang of elk. Wyeth was immediately for pursuing them,
rifle
in hand, but saw evident signs of dissatisfaction in his half-breed hunters; who considered him as
trenching upon their province, and meddling with things quite above his capacity; for these
veterans
of the wilderness are exceedingly pragmatical, on points of venery and woodcraft, and tenacious
of
their superiority; looking down with infinite contempt upon all raw beginners. The two worthies,
therefore, sallied forth themselves, but after a time returned empty-handed. They laid the blame,
however, entirely on their guns; two miserable old pieces with flint locks, which, with all their
picking and hammering, were continually apt to miss fire. These great boasters of the wilderness,
however, are very often exceeding bad shots, and fortunate it is for them when they have old flint
guns to bear the blame.

<p> The next day they passed where a great herd of buffalo was bellowing on a prairie. Again
the Castor
and Pollux of the wilderness sallied forth, and again their flint guns were at fault, and missed fire,
and nothing went off but the buffalo. Wyeth now found there was danger of losing his dinner if
he
depended upon his hunters; he took rifle in hand, therefore, and went forth himself. In the course
of
an hour he returned laden with buffalo meat, to the great mortification of the two regular hunters,
who were annoyed at being eclipsed by a greenhorn.

<p> All hands now set to work to prepare the midday repast. A fire was made under an immense
cotton-wood tree, that overshadowed a beautiful piece of meadow land; rich morsels of buffalo
hump were
soon roasting before it; in a hearty and prolonged repast, the two unsuccessful hunters gradually
recovered from their mortification; threatened to discard their old flint guns as soon as they
should
reach the settlements, and boasted more than ever of the wonderful shots they had made, when
they
had guns that never missed fire.

<p> Having hauled up their boat to dry in the sun, previous to making their repast, the voyagers
now set
it once more afloat, and proceeded on their way. They had constructed a sail out of their old tent,
which they hoisted whenever the wind was favorable, and thus skimmed along down the stream.
Their voyage was pleasant, notwithstanding the perils by sea and land, with which they were
environed. Whenever they could they encamped on islands for the greater security. If on the
mainland, and in a dangerous neighborhood, they would shift their camp after dark, leaving their
fire
burning, dropping down the river some distance, and making no fire at their second encampment. 
Sometimes they would float all night with the current; one keeping watch and steering while the
rest
slept. in such case, they would haul their boat on shore, at noon of the following day to dry; for
notwithstanding every precaution, she was gradually getting water-soaked and rotten.

<p> There was something pleasingly solemn and mysterious in thus floating down these wild
rivers at
night. The purity of the atmosphere in these elevated regions gave additional splendor to the
stars,
and heightened the magnificence of the firmament. The occasional rush and laving of the waters;
the
vague sounds from the surrounding wilderness; the dreary howl, or rather whine of wolves from
the
plains; the low grunting and bellowing of the buffalo, and the shrill neighing of the elk, struck
the
ear with an effect unknown in the daytime.

<p> The two knowing hunters had scarcely recovered from one mortification when they were
fated to
experience another. As the boat was gliding swiftly round a low promontory, thinly covered with
trees, one of them gave the alarm of Indians. The boat was instantly shoved from shore and every
one caught up his rifle. "Where are they?" cried Wyeth.

<p> "There -- there! riding on horseback!" cried one of the hunters.

<p> "Yes; with white scarfs on!" cried the other.

<p> Wyeth looked in the direction they pointed, but descried nothing but two bald eagles,
perched on a
low dry branch beyond the thickets, and seeming, from the rapid motion of the boat, to be
moving
swiftly in an opposite direction. The detection of this blunder in the two veterans, who prided
themselves on the sureness and quickness of their sight, produced a hearty laugh at their expense,
and put
an end to their vauntings.

<p> The Yellowstone, above the confluence of the Bighorn, is a clear stream; its waters were
now
gradually growing turbid, and assuming the yellow clay color of the Missouri. The current was
about
four miles an hour, with occasional rapids; some of them dangerous, but the voyagers passed
them
all without accident. The banks of the river were in many places precipitous with strata of
bituminous coal.

<p> They now entered a region abounding with buffalo --  that ever-journeying animal, which
moves in
countless droves from point to point of the vast wilderness; traversing plains, pouring through the
intricate defiles of mountains, swimming rivers, ever on the move, guided on its boundless
migrations by some traditionary knowledge, like the finny tribes of the ocean, which, at certain
seasons, find their mysterious paths across the deep and revisit the remotest shores.

<p> These great migratory herds of buffalo have their hereditary paths and highways, worn deep
through
the country, and making for the surest passes of the mountains, and the most practicable fords of
the
rivers. When once a great column is in full career, it goes straight forward, regardless of all
obstacles; those in front being impelled by the moving mass behind. At such times they

<p> will break through a camp, trampling down everything in their course.

<p> It was the lot of the voyagers, one night, to encamp at one of these buffalo landing places,
and
exactly on the trail. They had not been long asleep, when they were awakened by a great
bellowing,
and tramping, and the rush, and splash, and snorting of animals in the river. They had just time to
ascertain that a buffalo army was entering the river on the opposite side, and making toward the
landing place. With all haste they moved their boat and shifted their camp, by which time the
head
of the column had reached the shore, and came pressing up the bank.

<p> It was a singular spectacle, by the uncertain moonlight, to behold this countless throng
making their
way across the river, blowing, and bellowing, and splashing. Sometimes they pass in such dense
and
continuous column as to form a temporary dam across the river, the waters of which rise and rush
over their backs, or between their squadrons. The roaring and rushing sound of one of these vast
herds crossing a river, may sometimes in a still night be heard for miles.

<p> The voyagers now had game in profusion. They could kill as many buffaloes as they
pleased, and, occasionally, were wanton in their havoc; especially among scattered
herds, that came swimming near the boat. On one occasion, an old buffalo bull approached so
near that the half-breeds must fain try to noose him as they would a wild
horse. The noose was successfully thrown around his head, and secured him by the
horns, and they now promised themselves ample sport. The buffalo made prodigious
turmoil in the water, bellowing, and blowing, and floundering; and they all floated
down the stream together. At length he found foothold on a sandbar, and taking to his
heels, whirled the boat after him like a whale when harpooned; so that the hunters
were obliged to cast off their rope, with which strange head-gear the venerable bull
made off to the prairies.

<p> On the 24th of August, the bull boat emerged, with its adventurous crew, into the broad
bosom of
the mighty Missouri. Here, about six miles above the mouth of the Yellowstone, the voyagers
landed
at Fort Union, the distributing post of the American Fur Company in the western country.  It was
a
stockaded fortress, about two hundred and twenty feet square, pleasantly situated on a high bank.
Here they were hospitably entertained by Mr. M'Kenzie, the superintendent, and remained with
him
three days, enjoying the unusual luxuries of bread, butter, milk, and cheese, for the fort was well
supplied with domestic cattle, though it had no garden. The atmosphere of these elevated regions
is
said to be too dry for the culture of vegetables; yet the voyagers, in coming down the
Yellowstone,
had met with plums, grapes, cherries, and currants, and had observed ash and elm trees. Where
these
grow the climate cannot be incompatible with gardening.

<p> At Fort Union, Wyeth met with a melancholy memento of one of his men. This was a
powder-flask,
which a clerk had purchased from a Blackfoot warrior. It bore the initials of poor More, the
unfortunate youth murdered the year previously, at Jackson's Hole, by the Blackfeet, and whose
bones had been subsequently found by Captain Bonneville. This flask had either been passed
from
hand to hand of the youth, or, perhaps, had been brought to the fort by the very savage who slew
him.

<p> As the bull boat was now nearly worn out, and altogether unfit for the broader and more
turbulent
stream of the Missouri, it was given up, and a canoe of cottonwood, about twenty feet long,
fabricated by the Blackfeet, was purchased to supply its place. In this Wyeth hoisted his sail, and
bidding adieu to the hospitable superintendent of Fort Union, turned his prow to the east, and set
off
down the Missouri.

<p> He had not proceeded many hours, before, in the evening, he came to a large keel boat at
anchor. It
proved to be the boat of Captain William Sublette, freighted with munitions for carrying on a
powerful opposition to the American Fur Company. The voyagers went on board, where they
were
treated with the hearty hospitality of the wilderness, and passed a social evening, talking over
past
scenes and adventures, and especially the memorable fight at Pierre's Hole.

<p> Here Milton Sublette determined to give up further voyaging in the canoe, and remain with
his
brother; accordingly, in the morning, the fellow-voyagers took kind leave of each other. and
Wyeth
continued on his course. There was now no one on board of his boat that had ever voyaged on the
Missouri; it was, however, all plain sailing down the stream, without any chance of missing the
way.

<p> All day the voyagers pulled gently along, and landed in the evening and supped; then
re-embarking,
they suffered the canoe to float down with the current; taking turns to watch and sleep. The night
was
calm and serene; the elk kept up a continual whinnying or squealing, being the commencement
of
the season when they are in heat. In the midst of the night the canoe struck on a sand-bar, and all
hands were roused by the rush and roar of the wild waters, which broke around her. They were
all
obliged to jump overboard, and work hard to get her off, which was accomplished with much
difficulty.

<p> In the course of the following day they saw three grizzly bears at different times along the
bank. The
last one was on a point of land, and was evidently making for the river, to swim across. The two
half-breed hunters were now eager to repeat the manoeuvre of the noose; promising to entrap
Bruin, and
have rare sport in strangling and drowning him. Their only fear was, that he might take fright and
return to land before they could get between him and the shore.  Holding back, therefore, until he
was fairly committed in the centre of the stream, they then pulled forward with might and main,
so
as to cut off his retreat, and take him in the rear. One of the worthies stationed himself in the
bow,
with the cord and slip-noose, the other, with the Nez Perce, managed the paddles. There was
nothing
further from the thoughts of honest Bruin, however, than to beat a retreat. Just as the canoe was
drawing near, he turned suddenly round and made for it, with a horrible snarl and a tremendous
show
of teeth. The affrighted hunter called to his comrades to paddle off. Scarce had they turned the
boat
when the bear laid his enormous claws on the gunwale, and attempted to get on board. The canoe
was nearly overturned, and a deluge of water came pouring over the gunwale.  All was clamor,
terror, and confusion.  Every one bawled out - the bear roared and snarled - one caught up a gun;
but
water had rendered it useless. Others handled their paddles more effectually, and beating old
Bruin
about the head and claws, obliged him to relinquish his hold. They now plied their paddles with
might and main, the bear made the best of his way to shore, and so ended the second exploit of
the
noose; the hunters determined to have no more naval contests with grizzly bears.

<p> The voyagers were now out of range of Crows and Black-feet; but they were approaching
the
country of the Rees, or Arickaras; a tribe no less dangerous; and who were, generally, hostile to
small parties.

<p> In passing through their country, Wyeth laid by all day, and drifted quietly down the river at
night.
In this way he passed on, until he supposed himself safely through the region of danger; when he
resumed his voyage in the open day. On the 3d of September he had landed, at midday, to dine;
and
while some were making a fire, one of the hunters mounted a high bank to look out for game. He
had
scarce glanced his eye round, when he perceived horses grazing on the opposite side of the river.
Crouching down he slunk back to the camp, and reported what he had seen. On further
reconnoitering, the voyagers counted twenty-one lodges; and from the number of horses,
computed
that there must be nearly a hundred Indians encamped there. They now drew their boat, with all
speed and caution, into a thicket of water willows, and remained closely concealed all day. As
soon
as the night closed in they re-embarked. The moon would rise early; so that they had but about
two
hours of darkness to get past the camp. The night, however, was cloudy, with a blustering wind.
Silently, and with muffled oars, they glided down the river, keeping close under the shore
opposite
to the camp; watching its various lodges and fires, and the dark forms passing to and fro between
them. Suddenly, on turning a point of land, they found themselves close upon a camp on their
own
side of the river. It appeared that not more than one half of the band had crossed. They were
within
a few yards of the shore; they saw distinctly the savages -- some standing, some lying round the
fire.
Horses were grazing around. Some lodges were set up, others had been sent across the river. The
red
glare of the fires upon these wild groups and harsh faces, contrasted with the surrounding
darkness,
had a startling effect, as the voyagers suddenly came upon the scene.  The dogs of the camp
perceived them, and barked; but the Indians. fortunately, took no heed of their clamor. Wyeth
instantly sheered his boat out into the stream; when, unluckily it struck upon a sand-bar, and
stuck
fast. It was a perilous and trying situation; for he was fixed between the two camps, and within
rifle
range of both. All hands jumped out into the water, and tried to get the boat off; but as no one
dared
to give the word, they could not pull together, and their labor was in vain. In this way they
labored
for a long time; until Wyeth thought of giving a signal for a general heave, by lifting his hat. The
expedient succeeded. They launched their canoe again into deep water, and getting in, had the
delight
of seeing the camp fires of the savages soon fading in the distance.

<p> They continued under way the greater part of the night, until far beyond all danger from this
band,
when they pulled to shore, and encamped.

<p> The following day was windy, and they came near upsetting their boat in carrying sail. 
Toward
evening, the wind subsided and a beautiful calm night succeeded. They floated along with the
current
throughout the night, taking turns to watch and steer.  The deep stillness of the night was
occasionally interrupted by the neighing of the elk, the hoarse lowing of the buffalo, the hooting
of
large owls, and the screeching of the small ones, now and then the splash of a beaver, or the
gonglike
sound of the swan.

<p> Part of their voyage was extremely tempestuous; with high winds, tremendous thunder, and
soaking
rain; and they were repeatedly in extreme danger from drift-wood and sunken trees. On one
occasion, having continued to float at night, after the moon was down, they ran under a great
snag,
or sunken tree, with dry branches above the water. These caught the mast, while the boat swung
round, broadside to the stream, and began to fill with water. Nothing saved her from total wreck,
but
cutting away the mast. She then drove down the stream, but left one of the unlucky half-breeds
clinging to the snag, like a monkey to a pole. It was necessary to run in shore, toil up,
laboriously,
along the eddies and to attain some distance above the snag, when they launched forth again into
the
stream and floated down with it to his rescue.

<p> We forbear to detail all the circumstances and adventures of upward of a months voyage,
down the
windings and doublings of this vast river; in the course of which they stopped occasionally at a
post
of one of the rival fur companies, or at a government agency for an Indian tribe. Neither shall we
dwell upon the changes of climate and productions, as the voyagers swept down from north to
south,
across several degrees of latitude; arriving at the regions of oaks and sycamores; of mulberry and
basswood trees; of paroquets and wild turkeys. This is one of the characteristics of the middle
and
lower part of the Missouri; but still more so of the Mississippi, whose rapid current traverses a
succession of latitudes so as in a few days to float the voyager almost from the frozen regions to
the
tropics.

<p> The voyage of Wyeth shows the regular and unobstructed flow of the rivers, on the east side
of the
Rocky Mountains, in contrast to those of the western side; where rocks and rapids continually
menace and obstruct the voyager. We find him in a frail bark of skins, launching himself in a
stream
at the foot of the Rocky Mountains, and floating down from river to river, as they empty
themselves
into each other; and so he might have kept on upward of two thousand miles, until his little bark
should drift into the ocean. At present we shall stop with him at Cantonment Leavenworth, the
frontier post of the United States; where he arrived on the 27th of September.

<p> Here his first care was to have his Nez Perce Indian, and his half-breed boy, Baptiste,
vaccinated.
As they approached the fort, they were hailed by the sentinel. The sight of a soldier in full array,
with
what appeared to be a long knife glittering on the end of a musket, struck Baptiste with such
affright
that he took to his heels, bawling for mercy at the top of his voice. The Nez Perce would have
followed him, had not Wyeth assured him of his safety. When they underwent the operation of
the
lancet, the doctor's wife and another lady were present; both beautiful women. They were the
first
white women that they had seen, and they could not keep their eyes off of them. On returning to
the
boat, they recounted to their companions all that they had observed at the fort; but were
especially
eloquent about the white squaws, who, they said, were white as snow, and more beautiful than
any
human being they had ever beheld.

<p> We shall not accompany the captain any further in his Voyage; but will simply state that he
made
his way to Boston, where he succeeded in organizing an association under the name of "The
Columbia River Fishing and Trading Company," for his original objects of a salmon fishery and
a
trade in furs. A brig, the <em>May Dacres, </em>had been dispatched for the Columbia with
supplies; and he
was now on his way to the same point, at the head of sixty men, whom he had enlisted at St.
Louis;
some of whom were experienced hunters, and all more habituated to the life of the wilderness
than
his first band of "down-easters."

<p> We will now return to Captain Bonneville and his party, whom we left, making up their
packs and
saddling their horses, in Bear River Valley.
