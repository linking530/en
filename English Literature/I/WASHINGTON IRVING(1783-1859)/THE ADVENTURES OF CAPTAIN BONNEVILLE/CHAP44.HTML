<p> IT had been the intention of Captain Bonneville, in descending along Snake River, to scatter
his
trappers upon the smaller streams.  In this way a range of country is trapped by small
detachments
from a main body.  The outfit of a trapper is generally a rifle, a pound of powder, and four
pounds
of lead, with a bullet mould, seven traps, an axe, a hatchet, a knife and awl, a camp kettle, two
blankets, and, where supplies are plenty, seven pounds of flour. He has, generally, two or three
horses, to carry himself and his baggage and peltries.  Two trappers commonly go together, for
the
purposes of mutual assistance and support; a larger party could not easily escape the eyes of the
Indians. It is a service of peril, and even more so at present than formerly, for the Indians, since
they
have got into the habit of trafficking peltries with the traders, have learned the value of the
beaver,
and look upon the trappers as poachers, who are filching the riches from their streams, and

<p> interfering with their market. They make no hesitation, therefore, to murder the solitary
trapper, and
thus destroy a competitor, while they possess themselves of his spoils. It is with regret we add,
too,
that this hostility has in many cases been instigated by traders, desirous of injuring their rivals,
but
who have themselves often reaped the fruits of the mischief they have sown.

<p> When two trappers undertake any considerable stream, their mode of proceeding is, to hide
their
horses in some lonely glen, where they can graze unobserved.  They then build a small hut, dig
out
a canoe from a cotton-wood tree, and in this poke along shore silently, in the evening, and set
their
traps. These they revisit in the same silent way at daybreak. When they take any beaver they
bring
it home, skin it, stretch the skins on sticks to dry, and feast upon the flesh.  The body, hung up
before
the fire, turns by its own weight, and is roasted in a superior style; the tail is the trapper s tidbit; it
is cut off, put on the end of a stick, and toasted, and is considered even a greater dainty than the
tongue or the marrow-bone of a buffalo.

<p> With all their silence and caution, however, the poor trappers cannot always escape their
hawk-eyed
enemies. Their trail has been discovered, perhaps, and followed up for many a mile; or their
smoke
has been seen curling up out of the secret glen, or has been scented by the savages, whose sense
of
smell is almost as acute as that of sight. Sometimes they are pounced upon when in the act of
setting
their traps; at other times, they are roused from their sleep by the horrid war-whoop; or, perhaps,
have a bullet or an arrow whistling about their ears, in the midst of one of their beaver banquets. 
In
this way they are picked off, from time to time, and nothing is known of them, until, perchance,
their
bones are found bleaching in some lonely ravine, or on the banks of some nameless stream,
which
from that time is called after them. Many of the small streams beyond the mountains thus
perpetuate
the names of unfortunate trappers that have been murdered on their banks.

<p> A knowledge of these dangers deterred Captain Bonneville, in the present instance, from
detaching
small parties of trappers as he had intended; for his scouts brought him word that formidable
bands
of the Banneck Indians were lying on the Boisee and Payette Rivers, at no great distance, so that
they
would be apt to detect and cut off any stragglers. It behooved him, also, to keep his party
together,
to guard against any predatory attack upon the main body; he continued on his way, therefore,
without dividing his forces. And fortunate it was that he did so; for in a little while he
encountered
one of the phenomena of the western wilds that would effectually have prevented his scattered
people from finding each other again. In a word, it was the season of setting fire to the prairies.
As
he advanced he began to perceive great clouds of smoke at a distance, rising by degrees, and
spreading over the whole face of the country. The atmosphere became dry and surcharged with
murky vapor, parching to the skin, and irritating to the eyes.  When travelling among the hills,
they
could scarcely discern objects at the distance of a few paces; indeed, the least exertion of the
vision
was painful. There was evidently some vast conflagration in the direction toward which they
were
proceeding; it was as yet at a great distance, and during the day they could only see the smoke
rising
in larger and denser volumes, and rolling forth in an immense canopy. At night the skies were all
glowing with the reflection of unseen fires, hanging in an immense body of lurid light high above
the horizon.

<p> Having reached Gun Creek, an important stream coming from the left, Captain Bonneville
turned
up its course, to traverse the mountain and avoid the great bend of Snake River. Being now out of
the range of the Bannecks, he sent out his people in all directions to hunt the antelope for present
supplies; keeping the dried meats for places where game might be scarce.

<p> During four days that the party were ascending Gun Creek, the smoke continued to increase
so
rapidly that it was impossible to distinguish the face of the country and ascertain landmarks.
Fortunately, the travellers fell upon an Indian trail. which led them to the head-waters of the
Fourche
de Glace or Ice River, sometimes called the Grand Rond. Here they found all the plains and
valleys
wrapped in one vast conflagration; which swept over the long grass in billows of flame, shot up
every bush and tree, rose in great columns from the groves, and set up clouds of smoke that
darkened
the atmosphere. To avoid this sea of fire, the travellers had to pursue their course close along the
foot
of the mountains; but the irritation from the smoke continued to be tormenting.

<p> The country about the head-waters of the Grand Rond spreads out into broad and level
prairies,
extremely fertile, and watered by mountain springs and rivulets. These prairies are resorted to by
small bands of the Skynses, to pasture their horses, as well as to banquets upon the salmon which
abound in the neighboring waters. They take these fish in great quantities and without the least
difficulty; simply taking them out of the water with their hands, as they flounder and struggle in
the
numerous long shoals of the principal streams. At the time the travellers passed over these
prairies,
some of the narrow, deep streams by which they were intersected were completely choked with
salmon, which they took in great numbers. The wolves and bears frequent these streams at this
season, to avail themselves of these great fisheries.

<p> The travellers continued, for many days, to experience great difficulties and discomforts
from this
wide conflagration, which seemed to embrace the whole wilderness. The sun was for a great part
of
the time obscured by the smoke, and the loftiest mountains were hidden from view. Blundering
along in this region of mist and uncertainty, they were frequently obliged to make long circuits,
to
avoid obstacles which they could not perceive until close upon them. The Indian trails were their
safest guides, for though they sometimes appeared to lead them out of their direct course, they
always conducted them to the passes.

<p> On the 26th of August, they reached the head of the Way-lee-way River.  Here, in a valley
of the
mountains through which this head-water makes its way, they found a band of the Skynses, who
were extremely sociable, and appeared to be well disposed, and as they spoke the Nez Perce
language, an intercourse was easily kept up with them.

<p> In the pastures on the bank of this stream, Captain Bonneville encamped for a time, for the
purpose
of recruiting the strength of his horses.  Scouts were now sent out to explore the surrounding
country, and search for a convenient pass through the mountains toward the Wallamut or
Multnomah. After an absence of twenty days they returned weary and discouraged.  They had
been
harassed and perplexed in rugged mountain defiles, where their progress was continually
impeded
by rocks and precipices.  Often they had been obliged to travel along the edges of frightful
ravines,
where a false step would have been fatal.  In one of these passes, a horse fell from the brink of a
precipice, and would have been dashed to pieces had he not lodged among the branches of a tree,
from which he was extricated with great difficulty.  These, however, were not the worst of their
difficulties and perils. The great conflagration of the country, which had harassed the main party
in
its march, was still more awful the further this exploring party proceeded. The flames which
swept
rapidly over the light vegetation of the prairies assumed a fiercer character and took a stronger
hold
amid the wooded glens and ravines of the mountains. Some of the deep gorges and defiles sent
up
sheets of flame, and clouds of lurid smoke, and sparks and cinders that in the night made them
resemble the craters of volcanoes. The groves and forests, too, which crowned the cliffs, shot up
their
towering columns of fire, and added to the furnace glow of the mountains. With these stupendous
sights were combined the rushing blasts caused by the rarefied air, which roared and howled
through
the narrow glens, and whirled forth the smoke and flames in impetuous wreaths. Ever and anon,
too,
was heard the crash of falling trees, sometimes tumbling from crags and precipices, with
tremendous
sounds.

<p> In the daytime, the mountains were wrapped in smoke so dense and blinding, that the
explorers, if by chance they separated, could only find each other by shouting.  Often,
too, they had to grope their way through the yet burning forests, in constant peril
from the limbs and trunks of trees, which frequently fell across their path. At length
they gave up the attempt to find a pass as hopeless, under actual circumstances, and
made their way back to the camp to report their failure.
