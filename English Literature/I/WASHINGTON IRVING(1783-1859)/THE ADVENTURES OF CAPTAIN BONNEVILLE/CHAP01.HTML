<p> IN A RECENT WORK we have given an account of the grand enterprise of Mr. John
Jacob Astor to establish an American emporium for the fur trade at the mouth of the
Columbia, or Oregon River; of the failure of that enterprise through the capture of
Astoria by the British, in 1814; and of the way in which the control of the trade of the
Columbia and its dependencies fell into the hands of the Northwest Company. We have
stated, likewise, the unfortunate supineness of the American government in neglecting
the application of Mr. Astor for the protection of the American flag, and a small military
force, to enable him to reinstate himself in the possession of Astoria at the return of
peace; when the post was formally given up by the British government, though still
occupied by the Northwest Company. By that supineness the sovereignty in the country
has been virtually lost to the United States; and it will cost both governments much
trouble and difficulty to settle matters on that just and rightful footing on which they
would readily have been placed had the proposition of Mr. Astor been attended to. We
shall now state a few particulars of subsequent events, so as to lead the reader up to
the period of which we are about to treat, and to prepare him for the circumstances of
our narrative. 


<p> In consequence of the apathy and neglect of the American government, Mr. Astor
abandoned all thoughts of regaining Astoria, and made no further attempt to extend his
enterprises beyond the Rocky Mountains; and the Northwest Company considered
themselves the lords of the country. They did not long enjoy unmolested the sway
which they had somewhat surreptitiously attained. A fierce competition ensued between
them and their old rivals, the Hudson's Bay Company; which was carried on at great
cost and sacrifice, and occasionally with the loss of life. It ended in the ruin of most of
the partners of the Northwest Company; and the merging of the relics of that
establishment, in 1821, in the rival association. From that time, the Hudson's Bay
Company enjoyed a monopoly of the Indian trade from the coast of the Pacific to the
Rocky Mountains, and for a considerable extent north and south. They removed their
emporium from Astoria to Fort Vancouver, a strong post on the left bank of the
Columbia River, about sixty miles from its mouth; whence they furnished their interior
posts, and sent forth their brigades of trappers. 


<p> The Rocky Mountains formed a vast barrier between them and the United States, and
their stern and awful defiles, their rugged valleys, and the great western plains watered
by their rivers, remained almost a terra incognita to the American trapper. The
difficulties experienced in 1808, by Mr. Henry of the Missouri Company, the first
American who trapped upon the head-waters of the Columbia; and the frightful
hardships sustained by Wilson P. Hunt, Ramsay Crooks, Robert Stuart, and other
intrepid Astorians, in their ill-fated expeditions across the mountains, appeared for a
time to check all further enterprise in that direction. The American traders contented
themselves with following up the head branches of the Missouri, the Yellowstone, and
other rivers and streams on the Atlantic side of the mountains, but forbore to attempt
those great snow-crowned sierras. 


<p> One of the first to revive these tramontane expeditions was General Ashley, of Missouri,
a man whose courage and achievements in the prosecution of his enterprises have
rendered him famous in the Far West. In conjunction with Mr. Henry, already
mentioned, he established a post on the banks of the Yellowstone River in 1822, and in
the following year pushed a resolute band of trappers across the mountains to the
banks of the Green River or Colorado of the West, often known by the Indian name of
the Seeds-ke-dee Agie. This attempt was followed up and sustained by others, until in
1825 a footing was secured, and a complete system of trapping organized beyond the
mountains.


<p> It is difficult to do justice to the courage, fortitude, and perseverance of the pioneers of
the fur trade, who conducted these early expeditions, and first broke their way through a
wilderness where everything was calculated to deter and dismay them. They had to
traverse the most dreary and desolate mountains, and barren and trackless wastes,
uninhabited by man, or occasionally infested by predatory and cruel savages. They
knew nothing of the country beyond the verge of their horizon, and had to gather
information as they wandered. They beheld volcanic plains stretching around them, and
ranges of mountains piled up to the clouds, and glistening with eternal frost: but knew
nothing of their defiles, nor how they were to be penetrated or traversed. They launched
themselves in frail canoes on rivers, without knowing whither their swift currents would
carry them, or what rocks and shoals and rapids they might encounter in their course.
They had to be continually on the alert, too, against the mountain tribes, who beset
every defile, laid ambuscades in their path, or attacked them in their night
encampments; so that, of the hardy bands of trappers that first entered into these
regions, three-fifths are said to have fallen by the hands of savage foes. 


<p> In this wild and warlike school a number of leaders have sprung up, originally in the
employ, subsequently partners of Ashley; among these we may mention Smith,
Fitzpatrick, Bridger, Robert Campbell, and William Sublette; whose adventures and
exploits partake of the wildest spirit of romance. The association commenced by
General Ashley underwent various modifications. That gentleman having acquired
sufficient fortune, sold out his interest and retired; and the leading spirit that succeeded
him was Captain William Sublette; a man worthy of note, as his name has become
renowned in frontier story. He is a native of Kentucky, and of game descent; his
maternal grandfather, Colonel Wheatley, a companion of Boon, having been one of the
pioneers of the West, celebrated in Indian warfare, and killed in one of the contests of
the "Bloody Ground." We shall frequently have occasion to speak of this Sublette, and
always to the credit of his game qualities. In 1830, the association took the name of the
Rocky Mountain Fur Company, of which Captain Sublette and Robert Campbell were
prominent members.


<p> In the meantime, the success of this company attracted the attention and excited the
emulation of the American Fur Company, and brought them once more into the field of
their ancient enterprise. Mr. Astor, the founder of the association, had retired from busy
life, and the concerns of the company were ably managed by Mr. Ramsay Crooks, of
Snake River renown, who still officiates as its president. A competition immediately
ensued between the two companies for the trade with the mountain tribes and the
trapping of the head-waters of the Columbia and the other great tributaries of the
Pacific. Beside the regular operations of these formidable rivals, there have been from
time to time desultory enterprises, or rather experiments, of minor associations, or of
adventurous individuals beside roving bands of independent trappers, who either hunt
for themselves, or engage for a single season, in the service of one or other of the main
companies.


<p> The consequence is that the Rocky Mountains and the ulterior regions, from the
Russian possessions in the north down to the Spanish settlements of California, have
been traversed and ransacked in every direction by bands of hunters and Indian
traders; so that there is scarcely a mountain pass, or defile, that is not known and
threaded in their restless migrations, nor a nameless stream that is not haunted by the
lonely trapper. 


<p> The American fur companies keep no established posts beyond the mountains.
Everything there is regulated by resident partners; that is to say, partners who reside in
the tramontane country, but who move about from place to place, either with Indian
tribes, whose traffic they wish to monopolize, or with main bodies of their own men,
whom they employ in trading and trapping. In the meantime, they detach bands, or
"brigades" as they are termed, of trappers in various directions, assigning to each a
portion of country as a hunting or trapping ground. In the months of June and July,
when there is an interval between the hunting seasons, a general rendezvous is held, at
some designated place in the mountains, where the affairs of the past year are settled
by the resident partners, and the plans for the following year arranged. 


<p> To this rendezvous repair the various brigades of trappers from their widely separated
hunting grounds, bringing in the products of their year's campaign. Hither also repair the
Indian tribes accustomed to traffic their peltries with the company. Bands of free
trappers resort hither also, to sell the furs they have collected; or to engage their
services for the next hunting season. 


<p> To this rendezvous the company sends annually a convoy of supplies from its
establishment on the Atlantic frontier, under the guidance of some experienced partner
or officer. On the arrival of this convoy, the resident partner at the rendezvous depends
to set all his next year's machinery in motion. 


<p> Now as the rival companies keep a vigilant eye upon each other, and are anxious to
discover each other's plans and movements, they generally contrive to hold their annual
assemblages at no great distance apart. An eager competition exists also between their
respective convoys of supplies, which shall first reach its place of rendezvous. For this
purpose, they set off with the first appearance of grass on the Atlantic frontier and push
with all diligence for the mountains. The company that can first open its tempting
supplies of coffee, tobacco, ammunition, scarlet cloth, blankets, bright shawls, and
glittering trinkets has the greatest chance to get all the peltries and furs of the Indians
and free trappers, and to engage their services for the next season. It is able, also, to fit
out and dispatch its own trappers the soonest, so as to get the start of its competitors,
and to have the first dash into the hunting and trapping grounds. 


<p> A new species of strategy has sprung out of this hunting and trapping competition. The
constant study of the rival bands is to forestall and outwit each other; to supplant each
other in the good will and custom of the Indian tribes; to cross each other's plans; to
mislead each other as to routes; in a word, next to his own advantage, the study of the
Indian trader is the disadvantage of his competitor. 


<p> The influx of this wandering trade has had its effects on the habits of the mountain
tribes. They have found the trapping of the beaver their most profitable species of
hunting; and the traffic with the white man has opened to them sources of luxury of
which they previously had no idea. The introduction of firearms has rendered them
more successful hunters, but at the same time, more formidable foes; some of them,
incorrigibly savage and warlike in their nature, have found the expeditions of the fur
traders grand objects of profitable adventure. To waylay and harass a band of trappers
with their pack-horses, when embarrassed in the rugged defiles of the mountains, has
become as favorite an exploit with these Indians as the plunder of a caravan to the
Arab of the desert. The Crows and Blackfeet, who were such terrors in the path of the
early adventurers to Astoria, still continue their predatory habits, but seem to have
brought them to greater system. They know the routes and resorts of the trappers;
where to waylay them on their journeys; where to find them in the hunting seasons, and
where to hover about them in winter quarters. The life of a trapper, therefore, is a
perpetual state militant, and he must sleep with his weapons in his hands. 


<p> A new order of trappers and traders, also, has grown out of this system of things. In the
old times of the great Northwest Company, when the trade in furs was pursued chiefly
about the lakes and rivers, the expeditions were carried on in batteaux and canoes. The
voyageurs or boatmen were the rank and file in the service of the trader, and even the
hardy "men of the north," those great rufflers and game birds, were fain to be paddled
from point to point of their migrations. 


<p> A totally different class has now sprung up:--"the Mountaineers," the traders and
trappers that scale the vast mountain chains, and pursue their hazardous vocations
amidst their wild recesses. They move from place to place on horseback. The
equestrian exercises, therefore, in which they are engaged, the nature of the countries
they traverse, vast plains and mountains, pure and exhilarating in atmospheric qualities,
seem to make them physically and mentally a more lively and mercurial race than the
fur traders and trappers of former days, the self-vaunting "men of the north." A man
who bestrides a horse must be essentially different from a man who cowers in a canoe.
We find them, accordingly, hardy, lithe, vigorous, and active; extravagant in word, and
thought, and deed; heedless of hardship; daring of danger; prodigal of the present, and
thoughtless of the future. 


<p> A difference is to be perceived even between these mountain hunters and those of the
lower regions along the waters of the Missouri. The latter, generally French creoles, live
comfortably in cabins and log-huts, well sheltered from the inclemencies of the
seasons. They are within the reach of frequent supplies from the settlements; their life
is comparatively free from danger, and from most of the vicissitudes of the upper
wilderness. The consequence is that they are less hardy, self-dependent and game-spirited than
the mountaineer. If the latter by chance comes among them on his way to
and from the settlements, he is like a game-cock among the common roosters of the
poultry-yard. Accustomed to live in tents, or to bivouac in the open air, he despises the
comforts and is impatient of the confinement of the log-house. If his meal is not ready in
season, he takes his rifle, hies to the forest or prairie, shoots his own game, lights his
fire, and cooks his repast. With his horse and his rifle, he is independent of the world,
and spurns at all its restraints. The very superintendents at the lower posts will not put
him to mess with the common men, the hirelings of the establishment, but treat him as
something superior.


<p> There is, perhaps, no class of men on the face of the earth, says Captain Bonneville,
who lead a life of more continued exertion, peril, and excitement, and who are more
enamored of their occupations, than the free trappers of the West. No toil, no danger,
no privation can turn the trapper from his pursuit. His passionate excitement at times
resembles a mania. In vain may the most vigilant and cruel savages beset his path; in
vain may rocks and precipices and wintry torrents oppose his progress; let but a single
track of a beaver meet his eye, and he forgets all dangers and defies all difficulties. At
times, he may be seen with his traps on his shoulder, buffeting his way across rapid
streams, amidst floating blocks of ice: at other times, he is to be found with his traps
swung on his back clambering the most rugged mountains, scaling or descending the
most frightful precipices, searching, by routes inaccessible to the horse, and never
before trodden by white man, for springs and lakes unknown to his comrades, and
where he may meet with his favorite game. Such is the mountaineer, the hardy trapper
of the West; and such, as we have slightly sketched it, is the wild, Robin Hood kind of
life, with all its strange and motley populace, now existing in full vigor among the Rocky
Mountains. 


<p>  Having thus given the reader some idea of the actual state of the fur trade in the interior
of our vast continent, and made him acquainted with the wild chivalry of the mountains,
we will no longer delay the introduction of Captain Bonneville and his band into this field
of their enterprise, but launch them at once upon the perilous plains of the Far West.
