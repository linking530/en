<p> PROVISIONS were now growing scanty in the camp, and Captain Bonneville found it
necessary to
seek a new neighborhood. Taking leave, therefore, of his friends, the Skynses, he set off to the
westward, and, crossing a low range of mountains, encamped on the head-waters of the Ottolais.
Being now within thirty miles of Fort Wallah-Wallah, the trading post of the Hudson's Bay
Company,
he sent a small detachment of men thither to purchase corn for the subsistence of his party. The
men
were well received at the fort; but all supplies for their camp were peremptorily refused. Tempting
offers were made them, however, if they would leave their present employ, and enter into the
service
of the company; but they were not to be seduced.

 <p> When Captain Bonneville saw his messengers return empty-handed, he ordered an instant
move,
for there was imminent danger of famine. He pushed forward down the course of the Ottolais,
which
runs diagonal to the Columbia, and falls into it about fifty miles below the Wallah-Wallah. His
route
lay through a beautiful undulating country, covered with horses belonging to the Skynses, who
sent
them there for pasturage.

 <p> On reaching the Columbia, Captain Bonneville hoped to open a trade with the natives, for
fish and
other provisions, but to his surprise they kept aloof, and even hid themselves on his approach. He
soon discovered that they were under the influence of the Hudson's Bay Company, who had
forbidden
them to trade, or hold any communion with him.  He proceeded along the Columbia, but it was
everywhere the same; not an article of provisions was to be obtained from the natives, and he was
at
length obliged to kill a couple of his horses to sustain his famishing people. He now came to a
halt,
and consulted what was to be done. The broad and beautiful Columbia lay before them, smooth
and
unruffled as a mirror; a little more journeying would take them to its lower region; to the noble
valley
of the Wallamut, their projected winter quarters. To advance under present circumstances would
be
to court starvation. The resources of the country were locked against them, by the influence of a
jealous and powerful monopoly. If they reached the Wallamut, they could scarcely hope to obtain
sufficient supplies for the winter; if they lingered any longer in the country the snows would
gather upon
the mountains and cut off their retreat. By hastening their return, they would be able to reach the
Blue
Mountains just in time to find the elk, the deer, and the bighorn; and after they had supplied
themselves with provisions, they might push through the mountains before they were entirely
blocked by
snow. Influenced by these considerations, Captain Bonneville reluctantly turned his back a second
time on the Columbia, and set off for the Blue Mountains. He took his course up John Day's
River,
so called from one of the hunters in the original Astorian enterprise. As famine was at his heels, he
travelled fast, and reached the mountains by the 1st of October. He entered by the opening made
by
John Day's River; it was a rugged and difficult defile, but he and his men had become accustomed
to
hard scrambles of the kind. Fortunately, the September rains had extinguished the fires which
recently
spread over these regions; and the mountains, no longer wrapped in smoke, now revealed all their
grandeur and sublimity to the eye.

 <p> They were disappointed in their expectation of finding abundant game in the mountains;
large bands
of the natives had passed through, returning from their fishing expeditions, and had driven all the
game before them. It was only now and then that the hunters could bring in sufficient to keep the
party from starvation.

 <p> To add to their distress, they mistook their route, and wandered for ten days among high
and bald
hills of clay. At length, after much perplexity, they made their way to the banks of Snake River,
following the course of which, they were sure to reach their place of destination.

 <p> It was the 20th of October when they found themselves once more upon this noted
stream. The
Shoshokoes, whom they had met with in such scanty numbers on their journey down the river,
now
absolutely thronged its banks to profit by the abundance of salmon, and lay up a stock for winter
provisions. Scaffolds were everywhere erected, and immense quantities of fish drying upon them.
At
this season of the year, however, the salmon are extremely poor, and the travellers needed their
keen
sauce of hunger to give them a relish.

 <p> In some places the shores were completely covered with a stratum of dead salmon,
exhausted in
ascending the river, or destroyed at the falls; the fetid odor of which tainted the air.

<p> It was not until the travellers reached the head-waters of the Portneuf that they really found
themselves in a region of abundance. Here the buffaloes were in immense herds; and here they
remained for three days, slaying and cooking, and feasting, and indemnifying themselves by an
enormous carnival, for a long and hungry Lent. Their horses, too, found good pasturage, and
enjoyed
a little rest after a severe spell of hard travelling.

 <p> During this period, two horsemen arrived at the camp, who proved to be messengers sent
express
for supplies from Montero's party; which had been sent to beat up the Crow country and the
Black
Hills, and to winter on the Arkansas. They reported that all was well with the party, but that they
had
not been able to accomplish the whole of their mission, and were still in the Crow country, where
they
should remain until joined by Captain Bonneville in the spring. The captain retained the
messengers
with him until the 17th of November, when, having reached the caches on Bear River, and
procured
thence the required supplies, he sent them back to their party; appointing a rendezvous toward the
last of June following, on the forks of Wind River Valley, in the Crow country.

 <p> He now remained several days encamped near the caches, and having discovered a small
band of
Shoshonies in his neighborhood, purchased from them lodges, furs, and other articles of winter
comfort, and arranged with them to encamp together during the winter.

 <p> The place designed by the captain for the wintering ground was on the upper part of Bear
River,
some distance off. He delayed approaching it as long as possible, in order to avoid driving off the
buffaloes, which would be needed for winter provisions.  He accordingly moved forward but
slowly,
merely as the want of game and grass obliged him to shift his position. The weather had already
become extremely cold, and the snow lay to a considerable depth. To enable the horses to carry as
much dried meat as possible, he caused a cache to be made, in which all the baggage that could be
spared was deposited. This done, the party continued to move slowly toward their winter
quarters.

 <p> They were not doomed, however, to suffer from scarcity during the present winter.  The
people
upon Snake River having chased off the buffaloes before the snow had become deep, immense
herds
now came trooping over the mountains; forming dark masses on their sides, from which their
deep-mouthed bellowing sounded like the low peals and mutterings from a gathering
thunder-cloud. In
effect, the cloud broke, and down came the torrent thundering into the valley. It is utterly
impossible,
according to Captain Bonneville, to convey an idea of the effect produced by the sight of such
countless throngs of animals of such bulk and spirit, all rushing forward as if swept on by a
whirlwind.

 <p> The long privation which the travellers had suffered gave uncommon ardor to their present
hunting.
One of the Indians attached to the party, finding himself on horseback in the midst of the
buffaloes,
without either rifle, or bow and arrows, dashed after a fine cow that was passing close by him,
and
plunged his knife into her side with such lucky aim as to bring her to the ground.  It was a daring
deed; but hunger had made him almost desperate.

 <p> The buffaloes are sometimes tenacious of life, and must be wounded in particular parts. A
ball
striking the shagged frontlet of a bull produces no other effect than a toss of the head and greater
exasperation; on the contrary, a ball striking the forehead of a cow is fatal. Several instances
occurred
during this great hunting bout, of bulls fighting furiously after having received mortal wounds.
Wyeth,
also, was witness to an instance of the kind while encamped with Indians. During a grand hunt of
the
buffaloes, one of the Indians pressed a bull so closely that the animal turned suddenly on him. His
horse stopped short, or started back, and threw him. Before he could rise the bull rushed furiously
upon him, and gored him in the chest so that his breath came out at the aperture. He was
conveyed
back to the camp, and his wound was dressed. Giving himself up for slain, he called round him his
friends, and made his will by word of mouth. It was something like a death chant, and at the end
of
every sentence those around responded in concord. He appeared no ways intimidated by the
approach
of death. "I think," adds Wyeth, "the Indians die better than the white men; perhaps from having
less
fear about the future."

 <p> The buffaloes may be approached very near, if the hunter keeps to the leeward; but they
are quick
of scent, and will take the alarm and move off from a party of hunters to the windward, even
when
two miles distant.

 <p> The vast herds which had poured down into the Bear River Valley were now snow-bound,
and
remained in the neighborhood of the camp throughout the winter. This furnished the trappers and
their Indian friends a perpetual carnival; so that, to slay and eat seemed to be the main
occupations
of the day. It is astonishing what loads of meat it requires to cope with the appetite of a hunting
camp.

 <p> The ravens and wolves soon came in for their share of the good cheer. These constant
attendants
of the hunter gathered in vast numbers as the winter advanced. They might be completely out of
sight,
but at the report of a gun, flights of ravens would immediately be seen hovering in the air, no one
knew whence they came; while the sharp visages of the wolves would peep down from the brow
of
every hill, waiting for the hunter's departure to pounce upon the carcass.

 <p> Besides the buffaloes, there were other neighbors snow-bound in the valley, whose
presence did
not promise to be so advantageous. This was a band of Eutaw Indians who were encamped higher
up on the river. They are a poor tribe that, in a scale of the various tribes inhabiting these regions,
would rank between the Shoshonies and the Shoshokoes or Root Diggers; though more bold and
warlike than the latter. They have but few rifles among them, and are generally armed with bows
and
arrows.

 <p> As this band and the Shoshonies were at deadly feud, on account of old grievances, and as
neither
party stood in awe of the other, it was feared some bloody scenes might ensue. Captain
Bonneville,
therefore, undertook the office of pacificator, and sent to the Eutaw chiefs, inviting them to a
friendly
smoke, in order to bring about a reconciliation. His invitation was proudly declined; whereupon
he
went to them in person, and succeeded in effecting a suspension of hostilities until the chiefs of
the
two tribes could meet in council. The braves of the two rival camps sullenly acquiesced in the
arrangement. They would take their seats upon the hill tops, and watch their quondam enemies
hunting the buffalo in the plain below, and evidently repine that their hands were tied up from a
skirmish.  The worthy captain, however, succeeded in carrying through his benevolent mediation.
The
chiefs met; the amicable pipe was smoked, the hatchet buried, and peace formally proclaimed. 
After
this, both camps united and mingled in social intercourse. Private quarrels, however, would
occasionally occur in hunting, about the division of the game, and blows would sometimes be
exchanged over the carcass of a buffalo; but the chiefs wisely took no notice of these individual
brawls.

 <p> One day the scouts, who had been ranging the hills, brought news of several large herds of
antelopes in a small valley at no great distance. This produced a sensation among the Indians, for
both
tribes were in ragged condition, and sadly in want of those shirts made of the skin of the antelope.
It was determined to have "a surround," as the mode of hunting that animal is called. Everything
now
assumed an air of mystic solemnity and importance. The chiefs prepared their medicines or charms
each according to his own method, or fancied inspiration, generally with the compound of certain
simples; others consulted the entrails of animals which they had sacrificed, and thence drew
favorable
auguries. After much grave smoking and deliberating it was at length proclaimed that all who
were
able to lift a club, man, woman, or child, should muster for "the surround." When all had
congregated,
they moved in rude procession to the nearest point of the valley in question, and there halted.
Another
course of smoking and deliberating, of which the Indians are so fond, took place among the
chiefs.
Directions were then issued for the horsemen to make a circuit of about seven miles, so as to
encompass the herd. When this was done, the whole mounted force dashed off simultaneously, at
full
speed, shouting and yelling at the top of their voices. In a short space of time the antelopes,
started
from their hiding-places, came bounding from all points into the valley. The riders, now gradually
contracting their circle, brought them nearer and nearer to the spot where the senior chief,
surrounded
by the elders, male and female, were seated in supervision of the chase. The antelopes, nearly
exhausted with fatigue and fright, and bewildered by perpetual whooping, made no effort to break
through the ring of the hunters, but ran round in small circles, until man, woman, and child beat
them
down with bludgeons. Such is the nature of that species of antelope hunting, technically called "a
surround."
