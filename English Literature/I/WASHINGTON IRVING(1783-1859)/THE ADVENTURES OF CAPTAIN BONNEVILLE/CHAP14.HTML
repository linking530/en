<p>ON the 19th of December Captain Bonneville and his confederate Indians raised their camp,
and
entered the narrow gorge made by the north fork of Salmon River. Up this lay the secure and
plenteous hunting region so temptingly described by the Indians.

<p>Since leaving Green River the plains had invariably been of loose sand or coarse gravel, and
the
rocky formation of the mountains of primitive limestone.  The rivers, in general, were skirted
with
willows and bitter cottonwood trees, and the prairies covered with wormwood.  In the hollow
breast
of the mountains which they were now penetrating, the surrounding heights were clothed with
pine;
while the declivities of the lower hills afforded abundance of bunch grass for the horses.

<p>As the Indians had represented, they were now in a natural fastness of the mountains, the
ingress and
egress of which was by a deep gorge, so narrow, rugged, and difficult as to prevent secret
approach
or rapid retreat, and to admit of easy defence. The Blackfeet, therefore, refrained from venturing
in
after the Nez Perces, awaiting a better chance, when they should once more emerge into the open
country.

<p>Captain Bonneville soon found that the Indians had not exaggerated the advantages of this
region. 
Besides the numerous gangs of elk, large flocks of the ahsahta or bighorn, the mountain sheep,
were
to be seen bounding among the precipices.  These simple animals were easily circumvented and
destroyed.  A few hunters may surround a flock and kill as many as they please.  Numbers were
daily
brought into camp, and the flesh of those which were young and fat was extolled as superior to
the
finest mutton.

<p>Here, then, there was a cessation from toil, from hunger, and alarm.  Past ills and dangers
were
forgotten. The hunt, the game, the song, the story, the rough though good-humored joke, made
time
pass joyously away, and plenty and security reigned throughout the camp.

<p>Idleness and ease, it is said, lead to love, and love to matrimony, in civilized life, and the
same
process takes place in the wilderness.  Filled with good cheer and mountain mutton, one of the
free
trappers began to repine at the solitude of his lodge, and to experience the force of that great law
of
nature, "it is not meet for man to live alone.''

<p>After a night of grave cogitation he repaired to Kowsoter, the Pierced-nose chief, and
unfolded to
him the secret workings of his bosom.

<p>"I want," said he, "a wife. Give me one from among your tribe. Not a young, giddy-pated
girl, that
will think of nothing but flaunting and finery, but a sober, discreet, hard-working squaw; one that
will share my lot without flinching, however hard it may be; that can take care of my lodge, and
be
a companion and a helpmate to me in the wilderness." Kowsoter promised to look round among
the
females of his tribe, and procure such a one as he desired. Two days were requisite for the search.
At the expiration of these, Kowsoter, called at his lodge, and informed him that he would bring
his
bride to him in the course of the afternoon. He kept his word. At the appointed time he
approached,
leading the bride, a comely copper-colored dame attired in her Indian finery. Her father, mother,
brothers by the half dozen and cousins by the score, all followed on to grace the ceremony and
greet
the new and important relative.

<p>The trapper received his new and numerous family connection with proper solemnity; he
placed his
bride beside him, and, filling the pipe, the great symbol of peace, with his best tobacco, took two
or
three whiffs, then handed it to the chief who transferred it to the father of the bride, from whom it
was passed on from hand to hand and mouth to mouth of the whole circle of kinsmen round the
fire,
all maintaining the most profound and becoming silence.

<p>After several pipes had been filled and emptied in this solemn ceremonial, the chief
addressed the
bride, detailing at considerable length the duties of a wife which, among Indians, are little less
onerous than those of the pack-horse; this done, he turned to her friends and congratulated them
upon
the great alliance she had made. They showed a due sense of their good fortune, especially when
the
nuptial presents came to be distributed among the chiefs and relatives, amounting to about one
hundred and eighty dollars. The company soon retired, and now the worthy trapper found indeed
that
he had no green girl to deal with; for the knowing dame at once assumed the style and dignity of
a
trapper's wife: taking possession of the lodge as her undisputed empire, arranging everything
according to her own taste and habitudes, and appearing as much at home and on as easy terms
with
the trapper as if they had been man and wife for years.

<p>We have already given a picture of a free trapper and his horse, as furnished by Captain
Bonneville:
we shall here subjoin, as a companion picture, his description of a free trapper's wife, that the
reader
may have a correct idea of the kind of blessing the worthy hunter in question had invoked to
solace
him in the wilderness.

<p>"The free trapper, while a bachelor, has no greater pet than his horse; but the moment he
takes a wife
(a sort of brevet rank in matrimony occasionally bestowed upon some Indian fair one, like the
heroes
of ancient chivalry in the open field), he discovers that he has a still more fanciful and capricious
animal on which to lavish his expenses.

<p>"No sooner does an Indian belle experience this promotion, than all her notions at once rise
and
expand to the dignity of her situation, and the purse of her lover, and his credit into the bargain,
are
taxed to the utmost to fit her out in becoming style. The wife of a free trapper to be equipped and
arrayed like any ordinary and undistinguished squaw? Perish the grovelling thought! In the first
place, she must have a horse for her own riding; but no jaded, sorry, earth-spirited hack, such as
is
sometimes assigned by an Indian husband for the transportation of his squaw and her pappooses:
the
wife of a free trader must have the most beautiful animal she can lay her eyes on. And then, as to
his
decoration: headstall, breast-bands, saddle and crupper are lavishly embroidered with beads, and
hung with thimbles, hawks' bells, and bunches of ribbons. From each side of the saddle hangs an
esquimoot, a sort of pocket, in which she bestows the residue of her trinkets and nick-nacks,
which
cannot be crowded on the decoration of her horse or herself. Over this she folds, with great care,
a
drapery of scarlet and bright-colored calicoes, and now considers the caparison of her steed
complete.

<p>"As to her own person, she is even still more extravagant. Her hair, esteemed beautiful in
proportion
to its length, is carefully plaited, and made to fall with seeming negligence over either breast. Her
riding hat is stuck full of parti-colored feathers; her robe, fashioned somewhat after that of the
whites, is of red, green, and sometimes gray cloth, but always of the finest texture that can be
procured. Her leggings and moccasins are of the most beautiful and expensive workman-ship,
and
fitted neatly to the foot and ankle, which with the Indian woman are generally well formed and
delicate. Then as to jewelry: in the way of finger-rings, ear-rings, necklaces, and other female
glories, nothing within reach of the trapper's means is omitted that can tend to impress the
beholder
with an idea of the lady's high estate. To finish the whole, she selects from among her blankets of
various dyes one of some glowing color, and throwing it over her shoulders with a native grace,
vaults into the saddle of her gay, prancing steed, and is ready to follow her mountaineer 'to the
last
gasp with love and loyalty.' "

<p>Such is the general picture of the free trapper's wife, given by Captain Bonneville; how far it
applied
in its details to the one in question does not altogether appear, though it would seem from the
outset
of her connubial career, that she was ready to avail herself of all the pomp and circumstance of
her
new condition. It is worthy of mention that wherever there are several wives of free trappers in a
camp, the keenest rivalry exists between them, to the sore detriment of their husbands' purses.
Their
whole time is expended and their ingenuity tasked by endeavors to eclipse each other in dress
and
decoration. The jealousies and heart-burnings thus occasioned among these so-styled children of
nature are equally intense with those of the rival leaders of style and fashion in the luxurious
abodes
of civilized life.

<p>The genial festival of Christmas, which throughout all Christendom lights up the fireside of
home
with mirth and jollity, followed hard upon the wedding just described. Though far from kindred
and
friends, Captain Bonneville and his handful of free trappers were not disposed to suffer the
festival
to pass unenjoyed; they were in a region of good cheer, and were disposed to be joyous; so it was
determined to "light up the yule clog," and celebrate a merry Christmas in the heart of the
wilderness.

<p>On Christmas eve, accordingly, they began their rude fetes and rejoicings.  In the course of
the night
the free trappers surrounded the lodge of the Pierced-nose chief and in lieu of Christmas carols,
saluted him with a <em>feude joie</em>.

<p>Kowsoter received it in a truly Christian spirit, and after a speech, in which he expressed his
high
gratification at the honor done him, invited the whole company to a feast on the following day. 
His
invitation was gladly accepted. A Christmas dinner in the wigwam of an Indian chief! There was
novelty in the idea. Not one failed to be present. The banquet was served up in primitive style:
skins
of various kinds, nicely dressed for the occasion, were spread upon the ground; upon these were
heaped up abundance of venison, elk meat, and mountain mutton, with various bitter roots which
the Indians use as condiments.

<p>After a short prayer, the company all seated themselves cross-legged, in Turkish fashion, to
the
banquet, which passed off with great hilarity. After which various games of strength and agility
by
both white men and Indians closed the Christmas festivities.
