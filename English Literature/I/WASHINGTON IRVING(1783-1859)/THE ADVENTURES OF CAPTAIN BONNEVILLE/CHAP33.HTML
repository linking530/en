<p> IN RESUMING HIS JOURNEY, Captain Bonneville was conducted by the same Nez
Perce guide, whose knowledge of the country was important in choosing the routes and
resting places. He also continued to be accompanied by the worthy old chief with the
hard name, who seemed bent upon doing the honors of the country, and introducing
him to every branch of his tribe. The Way-lee-way, down the banks of which Captain
Bonneville and his companions were now travelling, is a considerable stream winding
through a succession of bold and beautiful scenes. Sometimes the landscape towered
into bold and mountainous heights that partook of sublimity; at other times, it stretched
along the water side in fresh smiling meadows, and graceful undulating valleys. 


<p> Frequently in their route they encountered small parties of the Nez Perces, with whom
they invariably stopped to shake hands; and who, generally, evinced great curiosity
concerning them and their adventures; a curiosity which never failed to be thoroughly
satisfied by the replies of the worthy Yo-mus-ro-y-e-cut, who kindly took upon himself to
be spokesman of the party. 


<p> The incessant smoking of pipes incident to the long talks of this excellent, but
somewhat garrulous old chief, at length exhausted all his stock of tobacco, so that he
had no longer a whiff with which to regale his white companions. In this emergency, he
cut up the stem of his pipe into fine shavings, which he mixed with certain herbs, and
thus manufactured a temporary succedaneum to enable him to accompany his long
colloquies and harangues with the customary fragrant cloud. 


<p> If the scenery of the Way-lee-way had charmed the travellers with its mingled amenity
and grandeur, that which broke upon them on once more reaching Snake River, filled
them with admiration and astonishment. At times, the river was overhung by dark and
stupendous rocks, rising like gigantic walls and battlements; these would be rent by
wide and yawning chasms, that seemed to speak of past convulsions of nature.
Sometimes the river was of a glassy smoothness and placidity; at other times it roared
along in impetuous rapids and foaming cascades. Here, the rocks were piled in the
most fantastic crags and precipices; and in another place, they were succeeded by
delightful valleys carpeted with green-award. The whole of this wild and varied scenery
was dominated by immense mountains rearing their distant peaks into the clouds. "The
grandeur and originality of the views, presented on every side," says Captain
Bonneville, "beggar both the pencil and the pen. Nothing we had ever gazed upon in
any other region could for a moment compare in wild majesty and impressive
sternness, with the series of scenes which here at every turn astonished our senses,
and filled us with awe and delight." 


<p> Indeed, from all that we can gather from the journal before us, and the accounts of
other travellers, who passed through these regions in the memorable enterprise of
Astoria, we are inclined to think that Snake River must be one of the most remarkable
for varied and striking scenery of all the rivers of this continent. From its head waters in
the Rocky Mountains, to its junction with the Columbia, its windings are upward of six
hundred miles through every variety of landscape. Rising in a volcanic region, amid
extinguished craters, and mountains awful with the traces of ancient fires, it makes its
way through great plains of lava and sandy deserts, penetrates vast sierras or
mountainous chains, broken into romantic and often frightful precipices, and crowned
with eternal snows; and at other times, careers through green and smiling meadows,
and wide landscapes of Italian grace and beauty. Wildness and sublimity, however,
appear to be its prevailing characteristics. 


<p> Captain Bonneville and his companions had pursued their journey a considerable
distance down the course of Snake River, when the old chief halted on the bank, and
dismounting, recommended that they should turn their horses loose to graze, while he
summoned a cousin of his from a group of lodges on the opposite side of the stream.
His summons was quickly answered. An Indian, of an active elastic form, leaped into a
light canoe of cotton-wood, and vigorously plying the paddle, soon shot across the river.
Bounding on shore, he advanced with a buoyant air and frank demeanor, and gave his
right hand to each of the party in turn. The old chief, whose hard name we forbear to
repeat, now presented Captain Bonneville, in form, to his cousin, whose name, we
regret to say, was no less hard being nothing less than Hay-she-in-cow-cow. The latter
evinced the usual curiosity to know all about the strangers, whence they came whither
they were going, the object of their journey, and the adventures they had experienced.
All these, of course, were ample and eloquently set forth by the communicative old
chief. To all his grandiloquent account of the bald-headed chief and his countrymen, the
Big Hearts of the East, his cousin listened with great attention, and replied in the
customary style of Indian welcome. He then desired the party to await his return, and,
springing into his canoe, darted across the river. In a little while he returned, bringing a
most welcome supply of tobacco, and a small stock of provisions for the road, declaring
his intention of accompanying the party. Having no horse, he mounted behind one of
the men, observing that he should procure a steed for himself on the following day.


<p> They all now jogged on very sociably and cheerily together. Not many miles beyond,
they met others of the tribe, among whom was one, whom Captain Bonneville and his
comrades had known during their residence among the Upper Nez Perces, and who
welcomed them with open arms. In this neighborhood was the home of their guide, who
took leave of them with a profusion of good wishes for their safety and happiness. That
night they put up in the hut of a Nez Perce, where they were visited by several warriors
from the other side of the river, friends of the old chief and his cousin, who came to
have a talk and a smoke with the white men. The heart of the good old chief was
overflowing with good will at thus being surrounded by his new and old friends, and he
talked with more spirit and vivacity than ever. The evening passed away in perfect
harmony and good-humor, and it was not until a late hour that the visitors took their
leave and recrossed the river.


<p> After this constant picture of worth and virtue on the part of the Nez Perce tribe, we
grieve to have to record a circumstance calculated to throw a temporary shade upon
the name. In the course of the social and harmonious evening just mentioned, one of
the captain's men, who happened to be something of a virtuoso in his way, and fond of
collecting curiosities, produced a small skin, a great rarity in the eyes of men
conversant in peltries. It attracted much attention among the visitors from beyond the
river, who passed it from one to the other, examined it with looks of lively admiration,
and pronounced it a great medicine.


<p> In the morning, when the captain and his party were about to set off, the precious skin
was missing. Search was made for it in the hut, but it was nowhere to be found; and it
was strongly suspected that it had been purloined by some of the connoisseurs from
the other side of the river.


<p> The old chief and his cousin were indignant at the supposed delinquency of their friends
across the water, and called out for them to come over and answer for their shameful
conduct. The others answered to the call with all the promptitude of perfect innocence,
and spurned at the idea of their being capable of such outrage upon any of the Big-hearted nation.
All were at a loss on whom to fix the crime of abstracting the invaluable
skin, when by chance the eyes of the worthies from beyond the water fell upon an
unhappy cur, belonging to the owner of the hut. He was a gallows-looking dog, but not
more so than most Indian dogs, who, take them in the mass, are little better than a
generation of vipers. Be that as it may, he was instantly accused of having devoured
the skin in question. A dog accused is generally a dog condemned; and a dog
condemned is generally a dog executed. So was it in the present instance. The
unfortunate cur was arraigned; his thievish looks substantiated his guilt, and he was
condemned by his judges from across the river to be hanged. In vain the Indians of the
hut, with whom he was a great favorite, interceded in his behalf. In vain Captain
Bonneville and his comrades petitioned that his life might be spared. His judges were
inexorable. He was doubly guilty: first, in having robbed their good friends, the Big
Hearts of the East; secondly, in having brought a doubt on the honor of the Nez Perce
tribe. He was, accordingly, swung aloft, and pelted with stones to make his death more
certain. The sentence of the judges being thoroughly executed, a post mortem
examination of the body of the dog was held, to establish his delinquency beyond all
doubt, and to leave the Nez Perces without a shadow of suspicion. Great interest, of
course, was manifested by all present, during this operation. The body of the dog was
opened, the intestines rigorously scrutinized, but, to the horror of all concerned, not a
particle of the skin was to be found--the dog had been unjustly executed! 


<p> A great clamor now ensued, but the most clamorous was the party from across the
river, whose jealousy of their good name now prompted them to the most vociferous
vindications of their innocence. It was with the utmost difficulty that the captain and his
comrades could calm their lively sensibilities, by accounting for the disappearance of
the skin in a dozen different ways, until all idea of its having been stolen was entirely
out of the question. 


<p> The meeting now broke up. The warriors returned across the river, the captain and his
comrades proceeded on their journey; but the spirits of the communicative old chief,
Yo-mus-ro-y-e-cut, were for a time completely dampened, and he evinced great
mortification at what had just occurred. He rode on in silence, except, that now and then
he would give way to a burst of indignation, and exclaim, with a shake of the head and
a toss of the hand toward the opposite shore--"bad men, very bad men across the
river"; to each of which brief exclamations, his worthy cousin, Hay-she-in-cow-cow,
would respond by a guttural sound of acquiescence, equivalent to an amen. 


<p> After some time, the countenance of the-old chief again cleared up, and he fell into
repeated conferences, in an under tone, with his cousin, which ended in the departure
of the latter, who, applying the lash to his horse, dashed forward and was soon out of
sight. In fact, they were drawing near to the village of another chief, likewise
distinguished by an appellation of some longitude, O-pushy-e-cut; but commonly known
as the great chief. The cousin had been sent ahead to give notice of their approach; a
herald appeared as before, bearing a powder-horn, to enable them to respond to the
intended salute. A scene ensued, on their approach to the village, similar to that which
had occurred at the village of the little chief. The whole population appeared in the field,
drawn up in lines, arrayed with the customary regard to rank and dignity. Then came on
the firing of salutes, and the shaking of hands, in which last ceremonial every individual,
man, woman, and child, participated; for the Indians have an idea that it is as
indispensable an overture of friendship among the whites as smoking of the pipe is
among the red men. The travellers were next ushered to the banquet, where all the
choicest viands that the village could furnish, were served up in rich profusion. They
were afterwards entertained by feats of agility and horseraces; indeed, their visit to the
village seemed the signal for complete festivity. In the meantime, a skin lodge had been
spread for their accommodation, their horses and baggage were taken care of, and
wood and water supplied in abundance. At night, therefore, they retired to their
quarters, to enjoy, as they supposed, the repose of which they stood in need. No such
thing, however, was in store for them. A crowd of visitors awaited their appearance, all
eager for a smoke and a talk. The pipe was immediately lighted, and constantly
replenished and kept alive until the night was far advanced. As usual, the utmost
eagerness was evinced by the guests to learn everything within the scope of their
comprehension respecting the Americans, for whom they professed the most fraternal
regard. The captain, in his replies, made use of familiar illustrations, calculated to strike
their minds, and impress them with such an idea of the might of his nation, as would
induce them to treat with kindness and respect all stragglers that might fall in their path.
To their inquiries as to the numbers of the people of the United States, he assured
them that they were as countless as the blades of grass in the prairies, and that, great
as Snake River was, if they were all encamped upon its banks, they would drink it dry in
a single day. To these and similar statistics, they listened with profound attention, and
apparently, implicit belief. It was, indeed, a striking scene: the captain, with his hunter's
dress and bald head in the midst, holding forth, and his wild auditors seated around like
so many statues, the fire lighting up their painted faces and muscular figures, all fixed
and motionless, excepting when the pipe was passed, a question propounded, or a
startling fact in statistics received with a movement of surprise and a half-suppressed
ejaculation of wonder and delight. 


<p> The fame of the captain as a healer of diseases, had accompanied him to this village,
and the great chief, O-push-y-e-cut, now entreated him to exert his skill on his daughter,
who had been for three days racked with pains, for which the Pierced-nose doctors
could devise no alleviation. The captain found her extended on a pallet of mats in
excruciating pain. Her father manifested the strongest paternal affection for her, and
assured the captain that if he would but cure her, he would place the Americans near
his heart. The worthy captain needed no such inducement. His kind heart was already
touched by the sufferings of the poor girl, and his sympathies quickened by her
appearance; for she was but about sixteen years of age, and uncommonly beautiful in
form and feature. The only difficulty with the captain was, that he knew nothing of her
malady, and that his medical science was of a most haphazard kind. After considering
and cogitating for some time, as a man is apt to do when in a maze of vague ideas, he
made a desperate dash at a remedy. By his directions, the girl was placed in a sort of
rude vapor bath, much used by the Nez Perces, where she was kept until near fainting.
He then gave her a dose of gunpowder dissolved in cold water, and ordered her to be
wrapped in buffalo robes and put to sleep under a load of furs and blankets. The
remedy succeeded: the next morning she was free from pain, though extremely languid;
whereupon, the captain prescribed for her a bowl of colt's head broth, and that she
should be kept for a time on simple diet. 


<p> The great chief was unbounded in his expressions of gratitude for the recovery of his
daughter. He would fain have detained the captain a long time as his guest, but the
time for departure had arrived. When the captain's horse was brought for him to mount,
the chief declared that the steed was not worthy of him, and sent for one of his best
horses, which he presented in its stead; declaring that it made his heart glad to see his
friend so well mounted. He then appointed a young Nez Perce to accompany his guest
to the next village, and "to carry his talk" concerning them; and the two parties
separated with mutual expressions of good will. 


<p> The vapor bath of which we have made mention is in frequent use among the Nez
Perce tribe, chiefly for cleanliness. Their sweating houses, as they call them, are small
and close lodges, and the vapor is produced by water poured slowly upon red-hot
stones. 


<p> On passing the limits of O-push-y-e-cut's domains, the travellers left the elevated
table-lands, and all the wild and romantic scenery which has just been described. They now
traversed a gently undulating country, of such fertility that it excited the rapturous
admiration of two of the captain's followers, a Kentuckian and a native of Ohio. They
declared that it surpassed any land that they had ever seen, and often exclaimed what
a delight it would be just to run a plough through such a rich and teeming soil, and see it
open its bountiful promise before the share. 


<p> Another halt and sojourn of a night was made at the village of a chief named
He-mim-el-pilp, where similar ceremonies were observed and hospitality experienced, as at the
preceding villages. They now pursued a west-southwest course through a beautiful and
fertile region, better wooded than most of the tracts through which they had passed. In
their progress, they met with several bands of Nez Perces, by whom they were
invariably treated with the utmost kindness. Within seven days after leaving the domain
of He-mim-el-pilp, they struck the Columbia River at Fort Wallah-Wallah, where they
arrived on the 4th of March, 1834.
