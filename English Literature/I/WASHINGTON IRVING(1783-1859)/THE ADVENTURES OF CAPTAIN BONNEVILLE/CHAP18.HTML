<p>HAVING now a pretty strong party, well armed and equipped, Captain Bonneville no longer
felt
the necessity of fortifying himself in the secret places and fastnesses of the mountains; but sallied
forth boldly into the Snake River plain, in search of his clerk, Hodgkiss, who had remained with
the
Nez Perces. He found him on the 24th of June, and learned from him another chapter of
misfortunes
which had recently befallen that ill-fated race.

<p>After the departure of Captain Bonneville in March, Kosato, the renegade Blackfoot, had
recovered
from the wound received in battle; and with his strength revived all his deadly hostility to his
native
tribe. He now resumed his efforts to stir up the Nez Perces to reprisals upon their old enemies;
reminding them incessantly of all the outrages and robberies they had recently experienced, and
assuring them that such would continue to be their lot until they proved themselves men by some
signal retaliation.

<p>The impassioned eloquence of the desperado at length produced an effect; and a band of
braves
enlisted under his guidance, to penetrate into the Blackfoot country, harass their Villages, carry
off
their horses, and commit all kinds of depredations.

<p>Kosato pushed forward on his foray as far as the Horse Prairie, where he came upon a strong
party
of Blackfeet. Without waiting to estimate their force, he attacked them with characteristic fury,
and
was bravely seconded by his followers. The contest, for a time, was hot and bloody; at length, as
is
customary with these two tribes, they paused, and held a long parley, or rather a war of words.

<p>"What need," said the Blackfoot chief, tauntingly, "have the Nez Perces to leave their homes,
and
sally forth on war parties, when they have danger enough at their own doors? If you want
fighting,
return to your villages; you will have plenty of it there. The Blackfeet warriors have hitherto
made
war upon you as children. They are now coming as men. A great force is at hand; they are on
their
way to your towns, and are determined to rub out the very name of the Nez Perces from the
mountains. Return, I say, to your towns, and fight there, if you wish to live any longer as a
people."

<p>Kosato took him at his word; for he knew the character of his native tribe.  Hastening back
with his
band to the Nez Perces village, he told all that he had seen and heard, and urged the most prompt
and
strenuous measures for defence. The Nez Perces, however, heard him with their accustomed
phlegm;
the threat of the Blackfeet had been often made, and as often had proved a mere bravado; such
they
pronounced it to be at present, and, of course, took no precautions.

<p>They were soon convinced that it was no empty menace. In a few days a band of three
hundred
Blackfeet warriors appeared upon the hills.  All now was consternation in the village. The force
of
the Nez Perces was too small to cope with the enemy in open fight; many of the young men
having
gone to their relatives on the Columbia to procure horses. The sages met in hurried council. What
was to be done to ward off a blow which threatened annihilation? In this moment of imminent
peril,
a Pierced-nose chief, named Blue John by the whites, offered to approach secretly with a small,
but
chosen band, through a defile which led to the encampment of the enemy, and, by a sudden
onset,
to drive off the horses. Should this blow be successful, the spirit and strength of the invaders
would
be broken, and the Nez Perces, having horses, would be more than a match for them. Should it
fail,
the village would not be worse off than at present, when destruction appeared inevitable.

<p>Twenty-nine of the choicest warriors instantly volunteered to follow Blue John in this
hazardous
enterprise.  They prepared for it with the solemnity and devotion peculiar to the tribe. Blue John
consulted his medicine, or talismanic charm, such as every chief keeps in his lodge as a
supernatural
protection. The oracle assured him that his enterprise would be completely successful, provided
no
rain should fall before he had passed through the defile; but should it rain, his band would be
utterly
cut off.

<p>The day was clear and bright; and Blue John anticipated that the skies would be propitious.
He
departed in high spirits with his forlorn hope; and never did band of braves make a more gallant
display-horsemen and horses being decorated and equipped in the fiercest and most glaring style
-
glittering with arms and ornaments, and fluttering with feathers.

<p>The weather continued serene until they reached the defile; but just as they were entering it a
black
cloud rose over the mountain crest, and there was a sudden shower. The warriors turned to their
leader, as if to read his opinion of this unlucky omen; but the countenance of Blue John remained
unchanged, and they continued to press forward. It was their hope to make their way
undiscovered
to the very vicinity of the Blackfoot camp; but they had not proceeded far in the defile, when
they
met a scouting party of the enemy. They attacked and drove them among the hills, and were
pursuing
them with great eagerness when they heard shouts and yells behind them, and beheld the main
body
of the Blackfeet advancing.

<p>The second chief wavered a little at the sight and proposed an instant retreat.  "We came to
fight!"
replied Blue John, sternly. Then giving his war-whoop, he sprang forward to the conflict.  His
braves
followed him.  They made a headlong charge upon the enemy; not with the hope of victory, but
the
determination to sell their lives dearly. A frightful carnage, rather than a regular battle,
succeeded.
The forlorn band laid heaps of their enemies dead at their feet, but were overwhelmed with
numbers
and pressed into a gorge of the mountain; where they continued to fight until they were cut to
pieces.
One only, of the thirty, survived. He sprang on the horse of a Blackfoot warrior whom he had
slain,
and escaping at full speed, brought home the baleful tidings to his village.

<p>Who can paint the horror and desolation of the inhabitants? The flower of their warriors laid
low,
and a ferocious enemy at their doors. The air was rent by the shrieks and lamentations of the
women,
who, casting off their ornaments and tearing their hair, wandered about, frantically bewailing the
dead and predicting destruction to the living. The remaining warriors armed themselves for
obstinate
defence; but showed by their gloomy looks and sullen silence that they considered defence
hopeless.
To their surprise the Blackfeet refrained from pursuing their advantage; perhaps satisfied with the
blood already shed, or disheartened by the loss they had themselves sustained. At any rate, they
disappeared from the hills, and it was soon ascertained that they had returned to the Horse
Prairie.

<p>The unfortunate Nez Perces now began once more to breathe. A few of their warriors, taking
pack-horses, repaired to the defile to bring away the bodies of their slaughtered brethren. They
found them
mere headless trunks; and the wounds with which they were covered showed how bravely they
had
fought. Their hearts, too, had been torn out and carried off; a proof of their signal valor; for in
devouring the heart of a foe renowned for bravery, or who has distinguished himself in battle, the
Indian victor thinks he appropriates to himself the courage of the deceased.

<p>Gathering the mangled bodies of the slain, and strapping them across their pack-horses, the
warriors
returned, in dismal procession, to the village. The tribe came forth to meet them; the women with
piercing cries and wailings; the men with downcast countenances, in which gloom and sorrow
seemed fixed as if in marble. The mutilated and almost undistinguishable bodies were placed in
rows
upon the ground, in the midst of the assemblage; and the scene of heart-rending anguish and
lamentation that ensued would have confounded those who insist on Indian stoicism.

<p>Such was the disastrous event that had overwhelmed the Nez Perces tribe during the absence
of
Captain Bonneville; and he was informed that Kosato, the renegade, who, being stationed in the
village, had been prevented from going on the forlorn hope, was again striving to rouse the
vindictive feelings of his adopted brethren, and to prompt them to revenge the slaughter of their
devoted braves.

<p>During his sojourn on the Snake River plain, Captain Bonneville made one of his first essays
at the
strategy of the fur trade.  There was at this time an assemblage of Nez Perces, Flatheads, and
Cottonois Indians encamped together upon the plain; well provided with beaver, which they had
collected during the spring.  These they were waiting to traffic with a resident trader of the
Hudson's
Bay Company, who was stationed among them, and with whom they were accustomed to deal. 
As
it happened, the trader was almost entirely destitute of Indian goods; his spring supply not having
yet reached him.  Captain Bonneville had secret intelligence that the supplies were on their way,
and
would soon arrive; he hoped, how-ever, by a prompt move, to anticipate their arrival, and secure
the
market to himself. Throwing himself, therefore, among the Indians, he opened his packs of
merchandise and displayed the most tempting wares: bright cloths, and scarlet blankets, and
glittering ornaments, and everything gay and glorious in the eyes of warrior or squaw; all,
however,
was in vain. The Hudson's Bay trader was a perfect master of his business, thoroughly acquainted
with the Indians he had to deal with, and held such control over them that none dared to act
openly
in opposition to his wishes; nay, more -- he came nigh turning the tables upon the captain, and
shaking the allegiance of some of his free trappers, by distributing liquors among them. The
latter,
therefore, was glad to give up a competition, where the war was likely to be carried into his own
camp.

<p>In fact, the traders of the Hudson's Bay Company have advantages over all competitors in the
trade
beyond the Rocky Mountains.  That huge monopoly centers within itself not merely its own
hereditary and long-established power and influence; but also those of its ancient rival, but now
integral part, the famous Northwest Company. It has thus its races of traders, trappers, hunters,
and
voyageurs, born and brought up in its service, and inheriting from preceding generations a
knowledge and aptitude in everything connected with Indian life, and Indian traffic. In the
process
of years, this company has been enabled to spread its ramifications in every direction; its system
of
intercourse is founded upon a long and intimate knowledge of the character and necessities of the
various tribes; and of all the fastnesses, defiles, and favorable hunting grounds of the country.
Their
capital, also, and the manner in which their supplies are distributed at various posts, or forwarded
by regular caravans, keep their traders well supplied, and enable them to furnish their goods to
the
Indians at a cheap rate. Their men, too, being chiefly drawn from the Canadas, where they enjoy
great influence and control, are engaged at the most trifling wages, and supported at little cost;
the
provisions which they take with them being little more than Indian corn and grease. They are
brought
also into the most perfect discipline and subordination, especially when their leaders have once
got
them to their scene of action in the heart of the wilderness. 

<p>These circumstances combine to give the leaders of the Hudson's Bay Company a decided
advantage
over all the American companies that come within their range, so that any close competition with
them is almost hopeless.

<p>Shortly after Captain Bonneville's ineffectual attempt to participate in the trade of the
associated
camp, the supplies of the Hudson's Bay Company arrived; and the resident trader was enabled to
monopolize the market.

<p>It was now the beginning of July; in the latter part of which month Captain Bonneville had
appointed
a rendezvous at Horse Creek in Green River Valley, with some of the parties which he had
detached
in the preceding year.  He now turned his thoughts in that direction, and prepared for the journey.

<p>The Cottonois were anxious for him to proceed at once to their country; which, they assured
him,
abounded in beaver. The lands of this tribe lie immediately north of those of the Flatheads and
are
open to the inroads of the Blackfeet. It is true, the latter professed to be their allies; but they had
been
guilty of so many acts of perfidy, that the Cottonois had, latterly, renounced their hollow
friendship
and attached themselves to the Flatheads and Nez Perces. These they had accompanied in their
migrations rather than remain alone at home, exposed to the outrages of the Blackfeet. They were
now apprehensive that these marauders would range their country during their absence and
destroy
the beaver; this was their reason for urging Captain Bonneville to make it his autumnal hunting
ground. The latter, however, was not to be tempted; his engagements required his presence at the
rendezvous in Green River Valley; and he had already formed his ulterior plans.

<p>An unexpected difficulty now arose. The free trappers suddenly made a stand, and declined
to
accompany him. It was a long and weary journey; the route lay through Pierre's Hole, and other
mountain passes infested by the Blackfeet, and recently the scenes of sanguinary conflicts. They
were not disposed to undertake such unnecessary toils and dangers, when they had good and
secure
trapping grounds nearer at hand, on the head-waters of Salmon River.

<p>As these were free and independent fellows, whose will and whim were apt to be law -- who
had the
whole wilderness before them, "where to choose," and the trader of a rival company at hand,
ready
to pay for their services -- it was necessary to bend to their wishes. Captain Bonneville fitted
them
out, therefore, for the hunting ground in question; appointing Mr. Hodgkiss to act as their
partisan,
or leader, and fixing a rendezvous where he should meet them in the course of the ensuing
winter.
The brigade consisted of twenty-one free trappers and four or five hired men as camp-keepers.
This
was not the exact arrangement of a trapping party; which when accurately organized is composed
of two thirds trappers whose duty leads them continually abroad in pursuit of game; and one
third
camp-keepers who cook, pack, and unpack; set up the tents, take care of the horses and do all
other
duties usually assigned by the Indians to their women. This part of the service is apt to be
fulfilled
by French creoles from Canada and the valley of the Mississippi.

<p>In the meantime the associated Indians having completed their trade and received their
supplies,
were all ready to disperse in various directions. As there was a formidable band of Blackfeet just
over a mountain to the northeast, by which Hodgkiss and his free trappers would have to pass;
and
as it was known that those sharp-sighted marauders had their scouts out watching every
movement
of the encampments, so as to cut off stragglers or weak detachments, Captain Bonneville
prevailed
upon the Nez Perces to accompany Hodgkiss and his party until they should be beyond the range
of
the enemy.

<p>The Cottonois and the Pends Oreilles determined to move together at the same time, and to
pass
close under the mountain infested by the Blackfeet; while Captain Bonneville, with his party,
was
to strike in an opposite direction to the southeast, bending his course for Pierre's Hole, on his way
to Green River.

<p>Accordingly, on the 6th of July, all the camps were raised at the same moment; each party
taking its
separate route. The scene was wild and picturesque; the long line of traders, trappers, and
Indians,
with their rugged and fantastic dresses and accoutrements; their varied weapons, their
innumerable
horses, some under the saddle, some burdened with packages, others following in droves; all
stretching in lengthening cavalcades across the vast landscape, making for different points of the
plains and mountains.
