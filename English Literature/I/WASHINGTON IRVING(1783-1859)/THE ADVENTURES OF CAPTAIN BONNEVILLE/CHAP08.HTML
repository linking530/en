<p> THE INFORMATION derived from the free trappers determined Captain Bonneville as
to his further movements. He learned that in the Green River valley the winters were
severe, the snow frequently falling to the depth of several feet; and that there was no
good wintering ground in the neighborhood. The upper part of Salmon River was
represented as far more eligible, besides being in an excellent beaver country; and
thither the captain resolved to bend his course. 


<p> The Salmon River is one of the upper branches of the Oregon or Columbia; and takes
its rise from various sources, among a group of mountains to the northwest of the Wind
River chain. It owes its name to the immense shoals of salmon which ascend it in the
months of September and October. The salmon on the west side of the Rocky
Mountains are, like the buffalo on the eastern plains, vast migratory supplies for the
wants of man, that come and go with the seasons. As the buffalo in countless throngs
find their certain way in the transient pasturage on the prairies, along the fresh banks of
the rivers, and up every valley and green defile of the mountains, so the salmon, at their
allotted seasons, regulated by a sublime and all-seeing Providence, swarm in myriads
up the great rivers, and find their way up their main branches, and into the minutest
tributory streams; so as to pervade the great arid plains, and to penetrate even among
barren mountains. Thus wandering tribes are fed in the desert places of the wilderness,
where there is no herbage for the animals of the chase, and where, but for these
periodical supplies, it would be impossible for man to subsist. 


<p> The rapid currents of the rivers which run into the Pacific render the ascent of them very
exhausting to the salmon. When the fish first run up the rivers, they are fat and in fine
order. The struggle against impetuous streams and frequent rapids gradually renders
them thin and weak, and great numbers are seen floating down the rivers on their
backs. As the season advances and the water becomes chilled, they are flung in
myriads on the shores, where the wolves and bears assemble to banquet on them.
Often they rot in such quantities along the river banks as to taint the atmosphere. They
are commonly from two to three feet long. 


<p> Captain Bonneville now made his arrangements for the autumn and the winter. The
nature of the country through which he was about to travel rendered it impossible to
proceed with wagons. He had more goods and supplies of various kinds, also, than
were required for present purposes, or than could be conveniently transported on
horseback; aided, therefore, by a few confidential men, he made <em>caches</em>, or secret
pits,
during the night, when all the rest of the camp were asleep, and in these deposited the
superfluous effects, together with the wagons. All traces of the caches were then
carefully obliterated. This is a common expedient with the traders and trappers of the
mountains. Having no established posts and magazines, they make these caches or
deposits at certain points, whither they repair, occasionally, for supplies. It is an
expedient derived from the wandering tribes of Indians. 


<p> Many of the horses were still so weak and lame, as to be unfit for a long scramble
through the mountains. These were collected into one cavalcade, and given in charge
to an experienced trapper, of the name of Matthieu. He was to proceed westward, with
a brigade of trappers, to Bear River;  a stream to the west of the Green River or
Colorado, where there was good pasturage for the horses. In this neighborhood it was
expected he would meet the Shoshonie villages or bands, on their yearly migrations,
with whom he was to trade for peltries and provisions. After he had traded with these
people, finished his trapping, and recruited the strength of the horses, he was to
proceed to Salmon River and rejoin Captain Bonneville, who intended to fix his quarters
there for the winter. 


<p> While these arrangements were in progress in the camp of Captain Bonneville, there
was a sudden bustle and stir in the camp of Fontenelle. One of the partners of the
American Fur Company had arrived, in all haste, from the rendezvous at Pierre's Hole,
in quest of the supplies. The competition between the two rival companies was just now
at its height, and prosecuted with unusual zeal. The tramontane concerns of the Rocky
Mountain Fur Company were managed by two resident partners, Fitzpatrick and
Bridger; those of the American Fur Company, by Vanderburgh and Dripps. The latter
were ignorant of the mountain regions, but trusted to make up by vigilance and activity
for their want of knowledge of the country. 


<p> Fitzpatrick, an experienced trader and trapper, knew the evils of competition in the
same hunting grounds, and had proposed that the two companies should divide the
country, so as to hunt in different directions: this proposition being rejected, he had
exerted himself to get first into the field. His exertions, as have already been shown,
were effectual. The early arrival of Sublette, with supplies, had enabled the various
brigades of the Rocky Mountain Company to start off to their respective hunting
grounds. Fitzpatrick himself, with his associate, Bridger, had pushed off with a strong
party of trappers, for a prime beaver country to the north-northwest. 


<p> This had put Vanderburgh upon his mettle. He had hastened on to meet Fontenelle.
Finding him at his camp in Green River valley, he immediately furnished himself with
the supplies; put himself at the head of the free trappers and Delawares, and set off
with all speed, determined to follow hard upon the heels of Fitzpatrick and Bridger. Of
the adventures of these parties among the mountains, and the disastrous effects of
their competition, we shall have occasion to treat in a future chapter. 


<p> Fontenelle having now delivered his supplies and accomplished his errand, struck his
tents and set off on his return to the Yellowstone. Captain Bonneville and his band,
therefore, remained alone in the Green River valley; and their situation might have been
perilous, had the Blackfeet band still lingered in the vicinity. Those marauders, however,
had been dismayed at finding so many resolute and well-appointed parties of white
men in the neighborhood. They had, therefore, abandoned this part of the country,
passing over the headwaters of the Green River, and bending their course towards the
Yellowstone. Misfortune pursued them. Their route lay through the country of their
deadly enemies, the Crows. In the Wind River valley, which lies east of the mountains,
they were encountered by a powerful war party of that tribe, and completely put to rout.
Forty of them were killed, many of their women and children captured, and the
scattered fugitives hunted like wild beasts until they were completely chased out of the
Crow country. 


<p> On the 22d of August Captain Bonneville broke up his camp, and set out on his route
for Salmon River. His baggage was arranged in packs, three to a mule, or pack-horse;
one being disposed on each side of the animal and one on the top; the three forming a
load of from one hundred and eighty to two hundred and twenty pounds. This is the
trappers' style of loading pack-horses; his men, however, were inexpert at adjusting the
packs, which were prone to get loose and slip off, so that it was necessary to keep a
rear-guard to assist in reloading. A few days' experience, however, brought them into
proper training. 


<p> Their march lay up the valley of the Seeds-ke-dee, overlooked to the right by the lofty
peaks of the Wind River Mountains. From bright little lakes and fountain-heads of this
remarkable bed of mountains poured forth the tributary streams of the Seeds-ke-dee.
Some came rushing down gullies and ravines; others tumbled in crystal cascades from
inaccessible clefts and rocks, and others winding their way in rapid and pellucid
currents across the valley, to throw themselves into the main river. So transparent were
these waters that the trout with which they abounded could be seen gliding about as if
in the air; and their pebbly beds were distinctly visible at the depth of many feet. This
beautiful and diaphanous quality of the Rocky Mountain streams prevails for a long time
after they have mingled their waters and swollen into important rivers. 


<p> Issuing from the upper part of the valley, Captain Bonneville continued to the east-northeast,
across rough and lofty ridges, and deep rocky defiles, extremely fatiguing
both to man and horse. Among his hunters was a Delaware Indian who had remained
faithful to him. His name was Buckeye. He had often prided himself on his skill and
success in coping with the grizzly bear, that terror of the hunters. Though crippled in the
left arm, he declared he had no hesitation to close with a wounded bear, and attack him
with a sword. If armed with a rifle, he was willing to brave the animal when in full force
and fury. He had twice an opportunity of proving his prowess, in the course of this
mountain journey, and was each time successful. His mode was to seat himself upon
the ground, with his rifle cocked and resting on his lame arm. Thus prepared, he would
await the approach of the bear with perfect coolness, nor pull trigger until he was close
at hand. In each instance, he laid the monster dead upon the spot. 


<p> A march of three or four days, through savage and lonely scenes, brought Captain
Bonneville to the fatal defile of Jackson's Hole, where poor More and Foy had been
surprised and murdered by the Blackfeet. The feelings of the captain were shocked at
beholding the bones of these unfortunate young men bleaching among the rocks; and
he caused them to be decently interred. 


<p> On the 3d of September he arrived on the summit of a mountain which commanded a
full view of the eventful valley of Pierre's Hole; whence he could trace the winding of its
stream through green meadows, and forests of willow and cotton-wood, and have a
prospect, between distant mountains, of the lava plains of Snake River, dimly spread
forth like a sleeping ocean below. 


<p> After enjoying this magnificent prospect, he descended into the valley, and visited the
scenes of the late desperate conflict. There were the remains of the rude fortress in the
swamp, shattered by rifle shot, and strewed with the mingled bones of savages and
horses. There was the late populous and noisy rendezvous, with the traces of trappers'
camps and Indian lodges; but their fires were extinguished, the motley assemblage of
trappers and hunters, white traders and Indian braves, had all dispersed to different
points of the wilderness, and the valley had relapsed into its pristine solitude and
silence. 


<p> That night the captain encamped upon the battle ground; the next day he resumed his
toilsome peregrinations through the mountains. For upwards of two weeks he continued
his painful march; both men and horses suffering excessively at times from hunger and
thirst. At length, on the 19th of September, he reached the upper waters of Salmon
River. 


<p> The weather was cold, and there were symptoms of an impending storm. The night set
in, but Buckeye, the Delaware Indian, was missing. He had left the party early in the
morning, to hunt by himself, according to his custom. Fears were entertained lest he
should lose his way and become bewildered in tempestuous weather. These fears
increased on the following morning, when a violent snow-storm came on, which soon
covered the earth to the depth of several inches. Captain Bonneville immediately
encamped, and sent out scouts in every direction. After some search Buckeye was
discovered, quietly seated at a considerable distance in the rear, waiting the expected
approach of the party, not knowing that they had passed, the snow having covered their
trail. 


<p> On the ensuing morning they resumed their march at an early hour, but had not
proceeded far when the hunters, who were beating up the country in the advance,
came galloping back, making signals to encamp, and crying Indians! Indians! 


<p> Captain Bonneville immediately struck into a skirt of wood and prepared for action. The
savages were now seen trooping over the hills in great numbers. One of them left the
main body and came forward singly, making signals of peace. He announced them as a
band of Nez Perces or Pierced-nose Indians, friendly to the whites, whereupon an
invitation was returned by Captain Bonneville for them to come and encamp with him.
They halted for a short time to make their toilette, an operation as important with an
Indian warrior as with a fashionable beauty. This done, they arranged themselves in
martial style, the chiefs leading the van, the braves following in a long line, painted and
decorated, and topped off with fluttering plumes. In this way they advanced, shouting
and singing, firing off their fusees, and clashing their shields. The two parties encamped
hard by each other. The Nez Perces were on a hunting expedition, but had been almost
famished on their march. They had no provisions left but a few dried salmon, yet finding
the white men equally in want, they generously offered to share even this meager
pittance, and frequently repeated the offer, with an earnestness that left no doubt of
their sincerity. Their generosity won the heart of Captain Bonneville, and produced the
most cordial good will on the part of his men. For two days that the parties remained in
company, the most amicable intercourse prevailed, and they parted the best of friends.
Captain Bonneville detached a few men, under Mr. Cerre, an able leader, to
accompany the Nez Perces on their hunting expedition, and to trade with them for meat
for the winter's supply. After this, he proceeded down the river, about five miles below
the forks, when he came to a halt on the 26th of September, to establish his winter
quarters.
