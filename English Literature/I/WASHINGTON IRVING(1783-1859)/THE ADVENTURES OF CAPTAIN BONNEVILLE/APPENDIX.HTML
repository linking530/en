<i>Nathaniel J. Wyeth, and the Trade of the Far West</i>

</center>
<p> WE HAVE BROUGHT Captain Bonneville to the end of his western campaigning; yet
we cannot close this work without subjoining some particulars concerning the fortunes
of his contemporary, Mr. Wyeth; anecdotes of whose enterprise have, occasionally,
been interwoven in the party-colored web of our narrative. Wyeth effected his intention
of establishing a trading post on the Portneuf, which he named Fort Hall. Here, for the
first time, the American flag was unfurled to the breeze that sweeps the great naked
wastes of the central wilderness. Leaving twelve men here, with a stock of goods, to
trade with the neighboring tribes, he prosecuted his journey to the Columbia; where he
established another post, called Fort Williams, on Wappatoo Island, at the mouth of the
Wallamut. This was to be the head factory of his company; whence they were to carry
on their fishing and trapping operations, and their trade with the interior; and where they
were to receive and dispatch their annual ship. 


<p> The plan of Mr. Wyeth appears to have been well concerted. He had observed that the
Rocky Mountain Fur Company, the bands of free trappers, as well as the Indians west
of the mountains, depended for their supplies upon goods brought from St. Louis;
which, in consequence of the expenses and risks of a long land carriage, were
furnished them at an immense advance on first cost. He had an idea that they might be
much more cheaply supplied from the Pacific side. Horses would cost much less on the
borders of the Columbia than at St. Louis: the transportation by land was much shorter;
and through a country much more safe from the hostility of savage tribes; which, on the
route from and to St. Louis, annually cost the lives of many men. On this idea, he
grounded his plan. He combined the salmon fishery with the fur trade. A fortified trading
post was to be established on the Columbia, to carry on a trade with the natives for
salmon and peltries, and to fish and trap on their own account. Once a year, a ship was
to come from the United States, to bring out goods for the interior trade, and to take
home the salmon and furs which had been collected. Part of the goods, thus brought
out, were to be dispatched to the mountains, to supply the trapping companies and the
Indian tribes, in exchange for their furs; which were to be brought down to the
Columbia, to be sent home in the next annual ship: and thus an annual round was to be
kept up. The profits on the salmon, it was expected, would cover all the expenses of the
ship; so that the goods brought out, and the furs carried home, would cost nothing as to
freight. 


<p> His enterprise was prosecuted with a spirit, intelligence, and perseverance, that merited
success. All the details that we have met with, prove him to be no ordinary man. He
appears to have the mind to conceive, and the energy to execute extensive and striking
plans. He had once more reared the American flag in the lost domains of Astoria; and
had he been enabled to maintain the footing he had so gallantly effected, he might
have regained for his country the opulent trade of the Columbia, of which our statesmen
have negligently suffered us to be dispossessed.


<p> It is needless to go into a detail of the variety of accidents and cross-purposes, which
caused the failure of his scheme. They were such as all undertakings of the kind,
involving combined operations by sea and land, are liable to. What he most wanted,
was sufficient capital to enable him to endure incipient obstacles and losses; and to
hold on until success had time to spring up from the midst of disastrous experiments. 


<p> It is with extreme regret we learn that he has recently been compelled to dispose of his
establishment at Wappatoo Island, to the Hudson's Bay Company; who, it is but justice
to say, have, according to his own account, treated him throughout the whole of his
enterprise, with great fairness, friendship, and liberality. That company, therefore, still
maintains an unrivalled sway over the whole country washed by the Columbia and its
tributaries. It has, in fact, as far as its chartered powers permit, followed out the
splendid scheme contemplated by Mr. Astor, when he founded his establishment at the
mouth of the Columbia. From their emporium of Vancouver, companies are sent forth in
every direction, to supply the interior posts, to trade with the natives, and to trap upon
the various streams. These thread the rivers, traverse the plains, penetrate to the heart
of the mountains, extend their enterprises northward, to the Russian possessions, and
southward, to the confines of California. Their yearly supplies are received by sea, at
Vancouver; and thence their furs and peltries are shipped to London. They likewise
maintain a considerable commerce, in wheat and lumber, with the Pacific islands, and
to the north, with the Russian settlements. 


<p> Though the company, by treaty, have a right to a participation only, in the trade of these
regions, and are, in fact, but tenants on sufferance; yet have they quietly availed
themselves of the original oversight, and subsequent supineness of the American
government, to establish a monopoly of the trade of the river and its dependencies; and
are adroitly proceeding to fortify themselves in their usurpation, by securing all the
strong points of the country. 


<p> Fort George, originally Astoria, which was abandoned on the removal of the main
factory to Vancouver, was renewed in 1830; and is now kept up as a fortified post and
trading house. All the places accessible to shipping have been taken possession of,
and posts recently established at them by the company. 


<p> The great capital of this association; their long established system; their hereditary
influence over the Indian tribes; their internal organization, which makes every thing go
on with the regularity of a machine; and the low wages of their people, who are mostly
Canadians, give them great advantages over the American traders: nor is it likely the
latter will ever be able to maintain any footing in the land, until the question of territorial
right is adjusted between the two countries. The sooner that takes place, the better. It is
a question too serious to national pride, if not to national interests, to be slurred over;
and every year is adding to the difficulties which environ it.


<p> The fur trade, which is now the main object of enterprise west of the Rocky Mountains,
forms but a part of the real resources of the country. Beside the salmon fishery of the
Columbia, which is capable of being rendered a considerable source of profit; the great
valleys of the lower country, below the elevated volcanic plateau, are calculated to give
sustenance to countless flocks and herds, and to sustain a great population of graziers
and agriculturists. 


<p>  Such, for instance, is the beautiful valley of the Wallamut; from which the establishment
at Vancouver draws most of its supplies. Here, the company holds mills and farms; and
has provided for some of its superannuated officers and servants. This valley, above
the falls, is about fifty miles wide, and extends a great distance to the south. The
climate is mild, being sheltered by lateral ranges of mountains; while the soil, for
richness, has been equalled to the best of the Missouri lands. The valley of the river
Des Chutes, is also admirably calculated for a great grazing country. All the best
horses used by the company for the mountains are raised there. The valley is of such
happy temperature, that grass grows there throughout the year, and cattle may be left
out to pasture during the winter. 

<p> These valleys must form the grand points of commencement of the future settlement of
the country; but there must be many such, en folded in the embraces of these lower
ranges of mountains; which, though at present they lie waste and uninhabited, and to
the eye of the trader and trapper, present but barren wastes, would, in the hands of
skilful agriculturists and husbandmen, soon assume a different aspect, and teem with
waving crops, or be covered with flocks and herds. 


<p> The resources of the country, too, while in the hands of a company restricted in its
trade, can be but partially called forth; but in the hands of Americans, enjoying a direct
trade with the East Indies, would be brought into quickening activity; and might soon
realize the dream of Mr. Astor, in giving rise to a flourishing commercial empire.

<center><i>Wreck of a Japanese Junk on the Northwest Coast </i></center>


<p> THE FOLLOWING EXTRACT of a letter which we received, lately, from Mr. Wyeth,
may be interesting, as throwing some light upon the question as to the manner in which
America has been peopled.


<blockquote>   "Are you aware of the fact, that in the winter of 1833, a Japanese junk
was wrecked on the northwest coast, in the neighborhood of Queen
Charlotte's Island; and that all but two of the crew, then much reduced by
starvation and disease, during a long drift across the Pacific, were killed
by the natives? The two fell into the hands of the Hudson's Bay Company,
and were sent to England. I saw them, on my arrival at Vancouver, in
1834." </blockquote>

Head Quarters of the Army.
<br>
Washington 29th July 1831.

<p> Sir,


<p> The leave of absence which you have asked for the purpose of enabling you to carry
into execution your designs of exploring the country to the Rocky Mountains, and
beyond with a view of assertaining the nature and character of the various tribes of
Indians inhabiting those regions; the trade which might be profitably carried on with
them, the quality of the soil, the productions, the minerals, the natural history, the
climate, the Geography, and Topography, as well as Geology of the various parts of the
Country within the limits of the Territories belonging to the United States, between our
frontier, and the Pacific;--has been duly considered, and submitted to the War
Department, for approval, and has been sanctioned. 


<p> You are therefore authorised to be absent from the Army untill October 1833. 


<p> It is understood that the Government is to be at no expence, in reference to your
proposed expedition, it having originated with yourself, and all that you required was the
permission from the proper authority to undertake the enterprise. You will naturally in
providing your self for the expedition, provide suitable instruments, and especially the
best Maps of the interior to be found. It is desirable besides what is enumerated as the
object of enterprise that you note particularly the number of Warriors that may belong to
each tribe, or nation that you may meet with: their alliances with other tribes and their
relative position as to a state of peace or war, and whether their friendly or warlike
dispositions towards each other are recent or of long standing. You will gratify us by
describing the manner of their making War, of the mode of subsisting themselves
during a state of war, and a state of peace, their Arms, and the effect of them, whether
they act on foot or on horse back, detailing the discipline, and manuvers of the war
parties, the power of their horses, size and general discription; in short any information
which you may conceive would be useful to the Government. You will avail yourself of
every opportunity of informing us of your position and progress, and at the expiration of
your leave of absence will join your proper station.


<p> I have the honor to be Sir,

<br>Your O<sup>t</sup> S<sup>t</sup>
