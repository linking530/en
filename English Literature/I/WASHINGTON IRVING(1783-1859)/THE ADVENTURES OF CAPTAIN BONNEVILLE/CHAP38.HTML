<p> IT WAS ON THE 24TH of July, in the preceding year (1833), that the brigade of forty
men set out from Green River valley, to explore the Great Salt Lake.  They were to
make the complete circuit of it, trapping on all the streams which should fall in their way,
and to keep journals and make charts, calculated to impart a knowledge of the lake and
the surrounding country. All the resources of Captain Bonneville had been tasked to fit
out this favorite expedition. The country lying to the southwest of the mountains, and
ranging down to California, was as yet almost unknown; being out of the buffalo range,
it was untraversed by the trapper, who preferred those parts of the wilderness where
the roaming herds of that species of animal gave him comparatively an abundant and
luxurious life. Still it was said the deer, the elk, and the bighorn were to be found there,
so that, with a little diligence and economy, there was no danger of lacking food. As a
precaution, however, the party halted on Bear River and hunted for a few days, until
they had laid in a supply of dried buffalo meat and venison; they then passed by the
head waters of the Cassie River, and soon found themselves launched on an immense
sandy desert. Southwardly, on their left, they beheld the Great Salt Lake, spread out
like a sea, but they found no stream running into it. A desert extended around them,
and stretched to the southwest, as far as the eye could reach, rivalling the deserts of
Asia and Africa in sterility. There was neither tree, nor herbage, nor spring, nor pool, nor
running stream, nothing but parched wastes of sand, where horse and rider were in
danger of perishing.


<p> Their sufferings, at length, became so great that they abandoned their intended course,
and made towards a range of snowy mountains, brightening in the north, where they
hoped to find water. After a time, they came upon a small stream leading directly
towards these mountains. Having quenched their burning thirst, and refreshed
themselves and their weary horses for a time, they kept along this stream, which
gradually increased in size, being fed by numerous brooks. After approaching the
mountains, it took a sweep toward the southwest, and the travellers still kept along it,
trapping beaver as they went, on the flesh of which they subsisted for the present,
husbanding their dried meat for future necessities. 


<p> The stream on which they had thus fallen is called by some, Mary River, but is more
generally known as Ogden's River, from Mr. Peter Ogden, an enterprising and intrepid
leader of the Hudson's Bay Company, who first explored it. The wild and half-desert
region through which the travellers were passing, is wandered over by hordes of
Shoshokoes, or Root Diggers, the forlorn branch of the Snake tribe. They are a shy
people, prone to keep aloof from the stranger. The travellers frequently met with their
trails, and saw the smoke of their fires rising in various parts of the vast landscape, so
that they knew there were great numbers in the neighborhood, but scarcely ever were
any of them to be met with.


<p> After a time, they began to have vexatious proofs that, if the Shoshokoes were quiet by
day, they were busy at night. The camp was dogged by these eavesdroppers; scarce a
morning, but various articles were missing, yet nothing could be seen of the marauders.
What particularly exasperated the hunters, was to have their traps stolen from the
streams. One morning, a trapper of a violent and savage character, discovering that his
traps had been carried off in the night, took a horrid oath to kill the first Indian he should
meet, innocent or guilty. As he was returning with his comrades to camp, he beheld two
unfortunate Diggers, seated on the river bank, fishing. Advancing upon them, he
levelled his rifle, shot one upon the spot, and flung his bleeding body into the stream.
The other Indian fled and was suffered to escape. Such is the indifference with which
acts of violence are regarded in the wilderness, and such the immunity an armed ruffian
enjoys beyond the barriers of the laws, that the only punishment this desperado met
with, was a rebuke from the leader of the party. The trappers now left the scene of this
infamous tragedy, and kept on westward, down the course of the river, which wound
along with a range of mountains on the right hand, and a sandy, but somewhat fertile
plain, on the left. As they proceeded, they beheld columns of smoke rising, as before, in
various directions, which their guilty consciences now converted into alarm signals, to
arouse the country and collect the scattered bands for vengeance. 


<p> After a time, the natives began to make their appearance, and sometimes in
considerable numbers, but always pacific; the trappers, however, suspected them of
deep-laid plans to draw them into ambuscades; to crowd into and get possession of
their camp, and various other crafty and daring conspiracies, which, it is probable,
never entered into the heads of the poor savages. In fact, they are a simple, timid,
inoffensive race, unpractised in warfare, and scarce provided with any weapons,
excepting for the chase. Their lives are passed in the great sand plains and along the
adjacent rivers; they subsist sometimes on fish, at other times on roots and the seeds
of a plant, called the cat's-tail. They are of the same kind of people that Captain
Bonneville found upon Snake River, and whom he found so mild and inoffensive. 


<p> The trappers, however, had persuaded themselves that they were making their way
through a hostile country, and that implacable foes hung round their camp or beset their
path, watching for an opportunity to surprise them. At length, one day they came to the
banks of a stream emptying into Ogden's River, which they were obliged to ford. Here a
great number of Shoshokoes were posted on the opposite bank. Persuaded they were
there with hostile intent, they advanced upon them, levelled their rifles, and killed twenty
five of them upon the spot. The rest fled to a short distance, then halted and turned
about, howling and whining like wolves, and uttering the most piteous wailings. The
trappers chased them in every direction; the poor wretches made no defence, but fled
with terror; neither does it appear from the accounts of the boasted victors, that a
weapon had been wielded or a weapon launched by the Indians throughout the affair.
We feel perfectly convinced that the poor savages had no hostile intention, but had
merely gathered together through motives of curiosity, as others of their tribe had done
when Captain Bonneville and his companions passed along Snake River.


<p> The trappers continued down Ogden's River, until they ascertained that it lost itself in a
great swampy lake, to which there was no apparent discharge. They then struck directly
westward, across the great chain of California mountains intervening between these
interior plains and the shores of the Pacific. 


<p> For three and twenty days they were entangled among these mountains, the peaks and
ridges of which are in many places covered with perpetual snow. Their passes and
defiles present the wildest scenery, partaking of the sublime rather than the beautiful,
and abounding with frightful precipices. The sufferings of the travellers among these
savage mountains were extreme: for a part of the time they were nearly starved; at
length, they made their way through them, and came down upon the plains of New
California, a fertile region extending along the coast, with magnificent forests, verdant
savannas, and prairies that looked like stately parks. Here they found deer and other
game in abundance, and indemnified themselves for past famine. They now turned
toward the south, and passing numerous small bands of natives, posted upon various
streams, arrived at the Spanish village and post of Monterey.


<p> This is a small place, containing about two hundred houses, situated in latitude 37&#176;
north. It has a capacious bay, with indifferent anchorage. The surrounding country is
extremely fertile, especially in the valleys; the soil is richer, the further you penetrate
into the interior, and the climate is described as a perpetual spring. Indeed, all
California, extending along the Pacific Ocean from latitude 19&#176; 30' to 42&#176; north, is
represented as one of the most fertile and beautiful regions in North America.


<p> Lower California, in length about seven hundred miles, forms a great peninsula, which
crosses the tropics and terminates in the torrid zone. It is separated from the mainland
by the Gulf of California, sometimes called the Vermilion Sea; into this gulf empties the
Colorado of the West, the Seeds-ke-dee, or Green River, as it is also sometimes called.
The peninsula is traversed by stern and barren mountains, and has many sandy plains,
where the only sign of vegetation is the cylindrical cactus growing among the clefts of
the rocks. Wherever there is water, however, and vegetable mould, the ardent nature of
the climate quickens everything into astonishing fertility. There are valleys luxuriant with
the rich and beautiful productions of the tropics. There the sugar-cane and indigo plant
attain a perfection unequalled in any other part of North America. There flourish the
olive, the fig, the date, the orange, the citron, the pomegranate, and other fruits
belonging to the voluptuous climates of the south; with grapes in abundance, that yield
a generous wine. In the interior are salt plains; silver mines and scanty veins of gold are
said, likewise, to exist; and pearls of a beautiful water are to be fished upon the coast.


<p> The peninsula of California was settled in 1698, by the Jesuits, who, certainly, as far as
the natives were concerned, have generally proved the most beneficent of colonists. In
the present instance, they gained and maintained a footing in the country without the
aid of military force, but solely by religious influence. They formed a treaty, and entered
into the most amicable relations with the natives, then numbering from twenty-five to
thirty thousand souls, and gained a hold upon their affections, and a control over their
minds, that effected a complete change in their condition. They built eleven missionary
establishments in the various valleys of the peninsula, which formed rallying places for
the surrounding savages, where they gathered together as sheep into the fold, and
surrendered themselves and their consciences into the hands of these spiritual pastors.
Nothing, we are told, could exceed the implicit and affectionate devotion of the Indian
converts to the Jesuit fathers, and the Catholic faith was disseminated widely through
the wilderness. The growing power and influence of the Jesuits in the New World at
length excited the jealousy of the Spanish government, and they were banished from
the colonies. The governor, who arrived at California to expel them, and to take charge
of the country, expected to find a rich and powerful fraternity, with immense treasures
hoarded in their missions, and an army of Indians ready to defend them. On the
contrary, he beheld a few venerable silverhaired priests coming humbly forward to meet
him, followed by a throng of weeping, but submissive natives. The heart of the
governor, it is said, was so touched by this unexpected sight, that he shed tears; but he
had to execute his orders. The Jesuits were accompanied to the place of their
embarkation by their simple and affectionate parishioners, who took leave of them with
tears and sobs. Many of the latter abandoned their heriditary abodes, and wandered off
to join their southern brethren, so that but a remnant remained in the peninsula. The
Franciscans immediately succeeded the Jesuits, and subsequently the Dominicans; but
the latter managed their affairs ill. But two of the missionary establishments are at
present occupied by priests; the rest are all in ruins, excepting one, which remains a
monument of the former power and prosperity of the order. This is a noble edifice, once
the seat of the chief of the resident Jesuits. It is situated in a beautiful valley, about half
way between the Gulf of California and the broad ocean, the peninsula being here
about sixty miles wide. The edifice is of hewn stone, one story high, two hundred and
ten feet in front, and about fifty-five feet deep. The walls are six feet thick, and sixteen
feet high, with a vaulted roof of stone, about two feet and a half in thickness. It is now
abandoned and desolate; the beautiful valley is without an inhabitant-- not a human
being resides within thirty miles of the place!


<p> In approaching this deserted mission-house from the south, the traveller passes over
the mountain of San Juan, supposed to be the highest peak in the Californias. From
this lofty eminence, a vast and magnificent prospect unfolds itself; the great Gulf of
California, with the dark blue sea beyond, studded with islands; and in another
direction, the immense lava plain of San Gabriel. The splendor of the climate gives an
Italian effect to the immense prospect. The sky is of a deep blue color, and the sunsets
are often magnificent beyond description. Such is a slight and imperfect sketch of this
remarkable peninsula.


<p> Upper California extends from latitude 31&#176; 10' to 42&#176; on the Pacific, and
inland, to the
great chain of snow-capped mountains which divide it from the sand plains of the
interior. There are about twenty-one missions in this province, most of which were
established about fifty years since, and are generally under the care of the Franciscans.
These exert a protecting sway over about thirty-five thousand Indian converts, who
reside on the lands around the mission houses. Each of these houses has fifteen miles
square of land allotted to it, subdivided into small lots, proportioned to the number of
Indian converts attached to the mission. Some are enclosed with high walls; but in
general they are open hamlets, composed of rows of huts, built of sunburnt bricks; in
some instances whitewashed and roofed with tiles. Many of them are far in the interior,
beyond the reach of all military protection, and dependent entirely on the good will of
the natives, which never fails them. They have made considerable progress in teaching
the Indians the useful arts. There are native tanners, shoemakers, weavers,
blacksmiths, stonecutters, and other artificers attached to each establishment. Others
are taught husbandry, and the rearing of cattle and horses; while the females card and
spin wool, weave, and perform the other duties allotted to their sex in civilized life. No
social intercourse is allowed between the unmarried of the opposite sexes after working
hours; and at night they are locked up in separate apartments, and the keys delivered
to the priests.


<p> The produce of the lands, and all the profits arising from sales, are entirely at the
disposal of the priests; whatever is not required for the support of the missions, goes to
augment a fund which is under their control. Hides and tallow constitute the principal
riches of the missions, and, indeed, the main commerce of the country. Grain might be
produced to an unlimited extent at the establishments, were there a sufficient market for
it. Olives and grapes are also reared at the missions.


<p> Horses and horned cattle abound throughout all this region; the former may be
purchased at from three to five dollars, but they are of an inferior breed. Mules, which
are here of a large size and of valuable qualities, cost from seven to ten dollars. 


<p> There are several excellent ports along this coast. San Diego, San Barbara, Monterey,
the bay of San Francisco, and the northern port of Bondago; all afford anchorage for
ships of the largest class. The port of San Francisco is too well known to require much
notice in this place. The entrance from the sea is sixty-seven fathoms deep, and within,
whole navies might ride with perfect safety. Two large rivers, which take their rise in
mountains two or three hundred miles to the east, and run through a country
unsurpassed for soil and climate, empty themselves into the harbor. The country
around affords admirable timber for ship-building. In a word, this favored port combines
advantages which not only fit it for a grand naval depot, but almost render it capable of
being made the dominant military post of these seas.


<p> Such is a feeble outline of the Californian coast and country, the value of which is more
and more attracting the attention of naval powers. The Russians have always a ship of
war upon this station, and have already encroached upon the Californian boundaries,
by taking possession of the port of Bondago, and fortifying it with several guns. Recent
surveys have likewise been made, both by the Russians and the English; and we have
little doubt, that, at no very distant day, this neglected, and, until recently, almost
unknown region, will be found to possess sources of wealth sufficient to sustain a
powerful and prosperous empire. Its inhabitants, themselves, are but little aware of its
real riches; they have not enterprise sufficient to acquaint themselves with a vast
interior that lies almost a terra incognita; nor have they the skill and industry to cultivate
properly the fertile tracts along the coast; nor to prosecute that foreign commerce which
brings all the resources of a country into profitable action.
