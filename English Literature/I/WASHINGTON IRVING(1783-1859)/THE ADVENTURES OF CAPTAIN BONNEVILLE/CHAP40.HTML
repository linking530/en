<p> THE horror and indignation felt by Captain Bonneville at the excesses of the Californian
adventurers were not participated by his men; on the contrary, the events of that expedition were
favorite themes in the camp. The heroes of Monterey bore the palm in all the gossipings among
the hunters. Their glowing descriptions of Spanish bear-baits and bull-fights especially, were
listened to with intense delight; and had another expedition to California been proposed, the
difficulty would have been to restrain a general eagerness to volunteer.

<p> The captain had not long been at the rendezvous when he perceived, by various signs, that
Indians were lurking in the neighborhood.  It was evident that the Blackfoot band, which he had
seen when on his march, had dogged his party, and were intent on mischief. He endeavored to
keep his camp on the alert; but it is as difficult to maintain discipline among trappers at a
rendezvous as among sailors when in port.


<p> Buckeye, the Delaware Indian, was scandalized at this heedlessness of the hunters when an
enemy was at hand, and was continually preaching up caution.  He was a little prone to play the
prophet, and to deal in signs and portents, which occasionally excited the merriment of his white
comrades. He was a great dreamer, and believed in charms and talismans, or medicines, and
could foretell the approach of strangers by the howling or barking of the small prairie wolf. This
animal, being driven by the larger wolves from the carcasses left on the hunting grounds by the
hunters, follows the trail of the fresh meat carried to the camp. Here the smell of the roast and
broiled, mingling with every breeze, keeps them hovering about the neighborhood; scenting
every blast, turning up their noses like hungry hounds, and testifying their pinching hunger by
long whining howls and impatient barkings. These are interpreted by the superstitious Indians
into warnings that strangers are at hand; and one accidental coincidence, like the chance
fulfillment of an almanac prediction, is sufficient to cover a thousand failures. This little,
whining, feast-smelling animal is, therefore, called among Indians the "medicine wolf;" and such
was one of Buckeye's infallible oracles.

<p> One morning early, the soothsaying Delaware appeared with a gloomy countenance.  His
mind
was full of dismal presentiments, whether from mysterious dreams, or the intimations of the
medicine wolf, does not appear. "Danger," he said, "was lurking in their path, and there would be
some fighting before sunset."  He was bantered for his prophecy, which was attributed to his
having supped too heartily, and been visited by bad dreams. In the course of the morning a party
of hunters set out in pursuit of buffaloes, taking with them a mule, to bring home the meat they
should procure. They had been some few hours absent, when they came clattering at full speed
into camp, giving the war cry of Blackfeet! Blackfeet!  Every one seized his weapon and ran to
learn the cause of the alarm. It appeared that the hunters, as they were returning leisurely, leading
their mule well laden with prime pieces of buffalo meat, passed close by a small stream overhung
with trees, about two miles from the camp. Suddenly a party of Blackfeet, who lay in ambush
along the thickets, sprang up with a fearful yell, and discharged a volley at the hunters. The latter
immediately threw themselves flat on their horses, put them to their speed, and never paused to
look behind, until they found themselves in camp. Fortunately they had escaped without a
wound; but the mule, with all the "provant," had fallen into the hands of the enemy This was a
loss, as well as an insult, not to be borne. Every man sprang to horse, and with rifle in hand,
galloped off to punish the Blackfeet, and rescue the buffalo beef. They came too late; the
marauders were off, and all that they found of their mule was the dents of his hoofs, as he had
been conveyed off at a round trot, bearing his savory cargo to the hills, to furnish the scampering
savages with a banquet of roast meat at the expense of the white men.

<p> The party returned to camp, balked of their revenge, but still more grievously balked of their
supper.  Buckeye, the Delaware, sat smoking by his fire, perfectly composed. As the hunters
related the particulars of the attack, he listened in silence, with unruffled countenance, then
pointing to the west, "the sun has not yet <strong>set,"</strong> said he: "Buckeye did not
dream like a <strong>fool!"</strong>

<p> All present now recollected the prediction of the Indian at daybreak, and were struck with
what
appeared to be its fulfilment. They called to mind, also, a long catalogue of foregone
presentiments and predictions made at various times by the Delaware, and, in their superstitious
credulity, began to consider him a veritable seer; without thinking how natural it was to predict
danger, and how likely to have the prediction verified in the present instance, when various signs
gave evidence of a lurking foe.

<p> The various bands of Captain Bonneville's company had now been assembled for some time
at
the rendezvous; they had had their fill of feasting, and frolicking, and all the species of wild and
often uncouth merrymaking, which invariably take place on these occasions. Their horses, as
well as themselves, had recovered from past famine and fatigue, and were again fit for active
service; and an impatience began to manifest itself among the men once more to take the field,
and set off on some wandering expedition.

<p> At this juncture M. Cerre arrived at the rendezvous at the head of a supply party, bringing
goods
and equipments from the States. This active leader, it will be recollected, had embarked the year
previously in skin-boats on the Bighorn, freighted with the year's collection of peltries. He had
met with misfortune in the course of his voyage: one of his frail barks being upset, and part of the
furs lost or damaged.

<p> The arrival of the supplies gave the regular finish to the annual revel. A grand outbreak of
wild
debauch ensued among the mountaineers; drinking, dancing, swaggering, gambling, quarrelling,
and fighting. Alcohol, which, from its portable qualities, containing the greatest quantity of fiery
spirit in the smallest compass, is the only liquor carried across the mountains, is the
inflammatory beverage at these carousals, and is dealt out to the trappers at four dollars a pint.
When inflamed by this fiery beverage, they cut all kinds of mad pranks and gambols, and
sometimes burn all their clothes in their drunken bravadoes. A camp, recovering from one of
these
riotous revels, presents a seriocomic spectacle; black eyes, broken heads, lack-lustre visages.
Many of the trappers have squandered in one drunken frolic the hard-earned wages of a year;
some have run in debt, and must toil on to pay for past pleasure. All are sated with this deep
draught of pleasure, and eager to commence another trapping campaign; for hardship and hard
work, spiced with the stimulants of wild adventures, and topped off with an annual frantic
carousal, is the lot of the restless trapper.

<p> The captain now made his arrangements for the current year.  Cerre and Walker, with a
number
of men who had been to California, were to proceed to St. Louis with the packages of furs
collected during the past year.  Another party, headed by a leader named Montero, was to
proceed to the Crow country, trap upon its various streams, and among the Black Hills, and
thence to proceed to the Arkansas, where he was to go into winter quarters.

<p> The captain marked out for himself a widely different course. He intended to make another
expedition, with twenty-three men to the lower part of the Columbia River, and to proceed to the
valley of the Multnomah; after wintering in those parts, and establishing a trade with those tribes,
among whom he had sojourned on his first visit, he would return in the spring, cross the Rocky
Mountains, and join Montero and his party in the month of July, at the rendezvous of the
Arkansas; where he expected to receive his annual supplies from the States.

<p> If the reader will cast his eye upon a map, he may form an idea of the contempt for distance
which a man acquires in this vast wilderness, by noticing the extent of country comprised in
these projected wanderings.  Just as the different parties were about to set out on the 3d of July,
on their opposite routes, Captain Bonneville received intelligence that Wyeth, the indefatigable
leader of the salmon-fishing enterprise, who had parted with him about a year previously on the
banks of the Bighorn, to descend that wild river in a bull boat, was near at hand, with a new
levied band of hunters and trappers, and was on his way once more to the banks of the Columbia,

<p> As we take much interest in the novel enterprise of this eastern man," and are pleased with
his
pushing and persevering spirit; and as his movements are characteristic of life in the wilderness,
we will, with the reader's permission, while Captain Bonneville is breaking up his camp and
saddling his horses, step back a year in time, and a few hundred miles in distance to the bank of
the Bighorn, and launch ourselves with Wyeth in his bull boat; and though his adventurous
voyage will take us many hundreds of miles further down wild and wandering rivers; yet such is
the magic power of the pen, that we promise to bring the reader safe to Bear River Valley, by the
time the last horse is saddled.
