<p> As CAPTAIN BONNEVILLE and his men were encamped one evening among the hills
near Snake River, seated before their fire, enjoying a hearty supper, they were
suddenly surprised by the visit of an uninvited guest. He was a ragged, half-naked
Indian hunter, armed with bow and arrows, and had the carcass of a fine buck thrown
across his shoulder. Advancing with an alert step, and free and easy air, he threw the
buck on the ground, and, without waiting for an invitation, seated himself at their mess,
helped himself without ceremony, and chatted to the right and left in the liveliest and
most unembarrassed manner. No adroit and veteran dinner hunter of a metropolis
could have acquitted himself more knowingly. The travellers were at first completely
taken by surprise, and could not but admire the facility with which this ragged
cosmopolite made himself at home among them. While they stared he went on, making
the most of the good cheer upon which he had so fortunately alighted; and was soon
elbow deep in "pot luck," and greased from the tip of his nose to the back of his ears. 


<p> As the company recovered from their surprise, they began to feel annoyed at this
intrusion. Their uninvited guest, unlike the generality of his tribe, was somewhat dirty as
well as ragged and they had no relish for such a messmate. Heaping up, therefore, an
abundant portion of the "provant" upon a piece of bark, which served for a dish, they
invited him to confine himself thereto, instead of foraging in the general mess. 


<p> He complied with the most accommodating spirit imaginable; and went on eating and
chatting, and laughing and smearing himself, until his whole countenance shone with
grease and good-humor. In the course of his repast, his attention was caught by the
figure of the gastronome, who, as usual, was gorging himself in dogged silence. A droll
cut of the eye showed either that he knew him of old, or perceived at once his
characteristics. He immediately made him the butt of his pleasantries; and cracked off
two or three good hits, that caused the sluggish dolt to prick up his ears, and delighted
all the company. From this time, the uninvited guest was taken into favor; his jokes
began to be relished; his careless, free and easy air, to be considered singularly
amusing; and in the end, he was pronounced by the travellers one of the merriest
companions and most entertaining vagabonds they had met with in the wilderness.


<p> Supper being over, the redoubtable Shee-wee-she-ouaiter, for such was the simple
name by which he announced himself, declared his intention of keeping company with
the party for a day or two, if they had no objection; and by way of backing his self-invitation,
presented the carcass of the buck as an earnest of his hunting abilities. By
this time, he had so completely effaced the unfavorable impression made by his first
appearance, that he was made welcome to the camp, and the Nez Perce guide
undertook to give him lodging for the night. The next morning, at break of day, he
borrowed a gun, and was off among the hills, nor was anything more seen of him until a
few minutes after the party had encamped for the evening, when he again made his
appearance, in his usual frank, careless manner, and threw down the carcass of
another noble deer, which he had borne on his back for a considerable distance. 


<p> This evening he was the life of the party, and his open communicative disposition, free
from all disguise, soon put them in possession of his history. He had been a kind of
prodigal son in his native village; living a loose, heedless life, and disregarding the
precepts and imperative commands of the chiefs. He had, in consequence, been
expelled from the village, but, in nowise disheartened at this banishment, had betaken
himself to the society of the border Indians, and had led a careless, haphazard,
vagabond life, perfectly consonant to his humors; heedless of the future, so long as he
had wherewithal for the present; and fearing no lack of food, so long as he had the
implements of the chase, and a fair hunting ground.


<p> Finding him very expert as a hunter, and being pleased with his eccentricities, and his
strange and merry humor, Captain Bonneville fitted him out handsomely as the Nimrod
of the party, who all soon became quite attached to him. One of the earliest and most
signal services he performed, was to exorcise the insatiate kill-crop that hitherto
oppressed the party. In fact, the doltish Nez Perce, who had seemed so perfectly
insensible to rough treatment of every kind, by which the travellers had endeavored to
elbow him out of their society, could not withstand the good-humored bantering, and
occasionally sharp wit of She-wee-she. He evidently quailed under his jokes, and sat
blinking like an owl in daylight, when pestered by the flouts and peckings of
mischievous birds. At length his place was found vacant at meal-time; no one knew
when he went off, or whither he had gone, but he was seen no more, and the vast
surplus that remained when the repast was over, showed what a mighty gormandizer
had departed. 


<p> Relieved from this incubus, the little party now went on cheerily. She-wee-she kept
them in fun as well as food. His hunting was always successful; he was ever ready to
render any assistance in the camp or on the march; while his jokes, his antics, and the
very cut of his countenance, so full of whim and comicality, kept every one in good-humor. 


<p> In this way they journeyed on until they arrived on the banks of the Immahah, and
encamped near to the Nez Perce lodges. Here She-wee-she took a sudden notion to
visit his people, and show off the state of worldly prosperity to which he had so
suddenly attained. He accordingly departed in the morning, arrayed in hunter's style,
and well appointed with everything benefitting his vocation. The buoyancy of his gait,
the elasticity of his step, and the hilarity of his countenance, showed that he anticipated,
with chuckling satisfaction, the surprise he was about to give those who had ejected
him from their society in rags. But what a change was there in his whole appearance
when he rejoined the party in the evening! He came skulking into camp like a beaten
cur, with his tail between his legs. All his finery was gone; he was naked as when he
was born, with the exception of a scanty flap that answered the purpose of a fig leaf.
His fellow-travellers at first did not know him, but supposed it to be some vagrant Root
Digger sneaking into the camp; but when they recognized in this forlorn object their
prime wag, She-wee-she, whom they had seen depart in the morning in such high glee
and high feather, they could not contain their merriment, but hailed him with loud and
repeated peals of laughter. 


<p> She-wee-she was not of a spirit to be easily cast down; he soon joined in the merriment
as heartily as any one, and seemed to consider his reverse of fortune an excellent joke.
Captain Bonneville, however, thought proper to check his good-humor, and demanded,
with some degree of sternness, the cause of his altered condition. He replied in the
most natural and self-complacent style imaginable, "that he had been among his
cousins, who were very poor; they had been delighted to see him; still more delighted
with his good fortune; they had taken him to their arms; admired his equipments; one
had begged for this; another for that"--in fine, what with the poor devil's inherent
heedlessness, and the real generosity of his disposition, his needy cousins had
succeeded in stripping him of all his clothes and accoutrements, excepting the fig leaf
with which he had returned to camp. 


<p> Seeing his total want of care and forethought, Captain Bonneville determined to let him
suffer a little, in hopes it might prove a salutary lesson; and, at any rate, to make him no
more presents while in the neighborhood of his needy cousins. He was left, therefore,
to shift for himself in his naked condition; which, however, did not seem to give him any
concern, or to abate one jot of his good-humor. In the course of his lounging about the
camp, however, he got possession of a deer skin; whereupon, cutting a slit in the
middle, he thrust his head through it, so that the two ends hung down before and
behind, something like a South American poncho, or the tabard of a herald. These ends
he tied together, under the armpits; and thus arrayed, presented himself once more
before the captain, with an air of perfect self-satisfaction, as though he thought it
impossible for any fault to be found with his toilet.


<p> A little further journeying brought the travellers to the petty village of Nez Perces,
governed by the worthy and affectionate old patriarch who had made Captain
Bonneville the costly present of the very fine horse. The old man welcomed them once
more to his village with his usual cordiality, and his respectable squaw and hopeful son,
cherishing grateful recollections of the hatchet and ear-bobs, joined in a chorus of
friendly gratulation. 


<p> As the much-vaunted steed, once the joy and pride of this interesting family, was now
nearly knocked up by travelling, and totally inadequate to the mountain scramble that
lay ahead, Captain Bonneville restored him to the venerable patriarch, with renewed
acknowledgments for the invaluable gift. Somewhat to his surprise, he was immediately
supplied with a fine two years' old colt in his stead, a substitution which he afterward
learnt, according to Indian custom in such cases, he might have claimed as a matter of
right. We do not find that any after claims were made on account of this colt. This
donation may be regarded, therefore, as a signal punctilio of Indian honor; but it will be
found that the animal soon proved an unlucky acquisition to the party. 


<p> While at this village, the Nez Perce guide had held consultations with some of the
inhabitants as to the mountain tract the party were about to traverse. He now began to
wear an anxious aspect, and to indulge in gloomy forebodings. The snow, he had been
told, lay to a great depth in the passes of the mountains, and difficulties would increase
as he proceeded. He begged Captain Bonneville, therefore, to travel very slowly, so as
to keep the horses in strength and spirit for the hard times they would have to
encounter. The captain surrendered the regulation of the march entirely to his
discretion, and pushed on in the advance, amusing himself with hunting, so as
generally to kill a deer or two in the course of the day, and arriving, before the rest of
the party, at the spot designated by the guide for the evening's encampment. 


<p> In the meantime, the others plodded on at the heels of the guide, accompanied by that
merry vagabond, She-wee-she. The primitive garb worn by this droll left all his nether
man exposed to the biting blasts of the mountains. Still his wit was never frozen, nor his
sunshiny temper beclouded; and his innumerable antics and practical jokes, while they
quickened the circulation of his own blood, kept his companions in high good-humor. 


<p> So passed the first day after the departure from the patriarch's. The second day
commenced in the same manner; the captain in the advance, the rest of the party
following on slowly. She-wee-she, for the greater part of the time, trudged on foot over
the snow, keeping himself warm by hard exercise, and all kinds of crazy capers. In the
height of his foolery, the patriarchal colt, which, unbroken to the saddle, was suffered to
follow on at large, happened to come within his reach. In a moment, he was on his
back, snapping his fingers, and yelping with delight. The colt, unused to such a burden,
and half wild by nature, fell to prancing and rearing and snorting and plunging and
kicking; and, at length, set off full speed over the most dangerous ground. As the route
led generally along the steep and craggy sides of the hills, both horse and horseman
were constantly in danger, and more than once had a hairbreadth escape from deadly
peril. Nothing, however, could daunt this madcap savage. He stuck to the colt like a
plaister [sic], up ridges, down gullies; whooping and yelling with the wildest glee. Never
did beggar on horseback display more headlong horsemanship. His companions
followed him with their eyes, sometimes laughing, sometimes holding in their breath at
his vagaries, until they saw the colt make a sudden plunge or start, and pitch his
unlucky rider headlong over a precipice. There was a general cry of horror, and all
hastened to the spot. They found the poor fellow lying among the rocks below, sadly
bruised and mangled. It was almost a miracle that he had escaped with life. Even in this
condition, his merry spirit was not entirely quelled, and he summoned up a feeble laugh
at the alarm and anxiety of those who came to his relief. He was extricated from his
rocky bed, and a messenger dispatched to inform Captain Bonneville of the accident.
The latter returned with all speed, and encamped the party at the first convenient spot.
Here the wounded man was stretched upon buffalo skins, and the captain, who
officiated on all occasions as doctor and surgeon to the party, proceeded to examine
his wounds. The principal one was a long and deep gash in the thigh, which reached to
the bone. Calling for a needle and thread, the captain now prepared to sew up the
wound, admonishing the patient to submit to the operation with becoming fortitude. His
gayety was at an end; he could no longer summon up even a forced smile; and, at the
first puncture of the needle, flinched so piteously, that the captain was obliged to pause,
and to order him a powerful dose of alcohol. This somewhat rallied up his spirit and
warmed his heart; all the time of the operation, however, he kept his eyes riveted on the
wound, with his teeth set, and a whimsical wincing of the countenance, that
occasionally gave his nose something of its usual comic curl. 


<p> When the wound was fairly closed, the captain washed it with rum, and administered a
second dose of the same to the patient, who was tucked in for the night, and advised to
compose himself to sleep. He was restless and uneasy, however; repeatedly
expressing his fears that his leg would be so much swollen the next day, as to prevent
his proceeding with the party; nor could he be quieted, until the captain gave a decided
opinion favorable to his wishes. 


<p> Early the next morning, a gleam of his merry humor returned, on finding that his
wounded limb retained its natural proportions. On attempting to use it, however, he
found himself unable to stand. He made several efforts to coax himself into a belief that
he might still continue forward; but at length, shook his head despondingly, and said,
that "as he had but one leg," it was all in vain to attempt a passage of the mountain. 


<p> Every one grieved to part with so boon a companion, and under such disastrous
circumstances. He was once more clothed and equipped, each one making him some
parting present. He was then helped on a horse, which Captain Bonneville presented to
him; and after many parting expressions of good will on both sides, set off on his return
to his old haunts; doubtless, to be once more plucked by his affectionate but needy
cousins.
