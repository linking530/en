<p>THE continued absence of Matthieu and his party had, by this time, caused great uneasiness
in the
mind of Captain Bonneville; and, finding there was no dependence to be placed upon the
perseverance and courage of scouting parties in so perilous a quest, he determined to set out
himself
on the search, and to keep on until he should ascertain something of the object of his solicitude.

<p>Accordingly on the 20th December he left the camp, accompanied by thirteen stark trappers
and
hunters, all well mounted and armed for dangerous enterprise. On the following morning they
passed
out at the head of the mountain gorge and sallied forth into the open plain. As they confidently
expected a brush with the Blackfeet, or some other predatory horde, they moved with great
circumspection, and kept vigilant watch in their encampments.

<p>In the course of another day they left the main branch of Salmon River, and proceeded south
toward
a pass called John Day's defile. It was severe and arduous travelling. The plains were swept by
keen
and bitter blasts of wintry wind; the ground was generally covered with snow, game was scarce,
so
that hunger generally prevailed in the camp, while the want of pasturage soon began to manifest
itself in the declining vigor of the horses.

<p>The party had scarcely encamped on the afternoon of the 28th, when two of the hunters who
had
sallied forth in quest of game came galloping back in great alarm. While hunting they had
perceived
a party of savages, evidently manoeuvring to cut them off from the camp; and nothing had saved
them from being entrapped but the speed of their horses.

<p>These tidings struck dismay into the camp. Captain Bonneville endeavored to reassure his
men by
representing the position of their encampment, and its capability of defence.  He then ordered the
horses to be driven in and picketed, and threw up a rough breastwork of fallen trunks of trees and
the vegetable rubbish of the wilderness. Within this barrier was maintained a vigilant watch
throughout the night, which passed away without alarm. At early dawn they scrutinized the
surrounding plain, to discover whether any enemies had been lurking about during the night; not
a
foot-print, however, was to be discovered in the coarse gravel with which the plain was covered.

<p>Hunger now began to cause more uneasiness than the apprehensions of surrounding enemies.
After
marching a few miles they encamped at the foot of a mountain, in hopes of finding buffalo. It
was
not until the next day that they discovered a pair of fine bulls on the edge of the plain, among
rocks
and ravines. Having now been two days and a half without a mouthful of food, they took especial
care that these animals should not escape them.  While some of the surest marksmen advanced
cautiously with their rifles into the rough ground, four of the best mounted horsemen took their
stations in the plain, to run the bulls down should they only be maimed.

<p>The buffalo were wounded and set off in headlong flight.  The half-famished horses were too
weak
to overtake them on the frozen ground, but succeeded in driving them on the ice, where they
slipped
and fell, and were easily dispatched. The hunters loaded themselves with beef for present and
future
supply, and then returned and encamped at the last nights's fire.  Here they passed the remainder
of
the day, cooking and eating with a voracity proportioned to previous starvation, forgetting in the
hearty revel of the moment the certain dangers with which they were environed.

<p>The cravings of hunger being satisfied, they now began to debate about their further
progress. The
men were much disheartened by the hardships they had already endured. Indeed, two who had
been
in the rear guard, taking advantage of their position, had deserted and returned to the lodges of
the
Nez Perces. The prospect ahead was enough to stagger the stoutest heart. They were in the dead
of
winter. As far as the eye could reach the wild landscape was wrapped in snow, which was
evidently
deepening as they advanced.  Over this they would have to toil, with the icy wind blowing in
their
faces:  their horses might give out through want of pasturage, and they themselves must expect
intervals of horrible famine like that they had already experienced.

<p>With Captain Bonneville, however, perseverance was a matter of pride; and, having
undertaken this
enterprise, nothing could turn him back until it was accomplished: though he declares that, had
he
anticipated the difficulties and sufferings which attended it, he should have flinched from the
undertaking.

<p>Onward, therefore, the little band urged their way, keeping along the course of a stream
called John
Day's Creek. The cold was so intense that they had frequently to dismount and travel on foot, lest
they should freeze in their saddles. The days which at this season are short enough even in the
open
prairies, were narrowed to a few hours by the high mountains, which allowed the travellers but a
brief enjoyment of the cheering rays of the sun.  The snow was generally at least twenty inches in
depth, and in many places much more: those who dismounted had to beat their way with
toilsome
steps. Eight miles were considered a good day's journey. The horses were almost famished; for
the
herbage was covered by the deep snow, so that they had nothing to subsist upon but scanty wisps
of the dry bunch grass which peered above the surface, and the small branches and twigs of
frozen
willows and wormwood.

<p>In this way they urged their slow and painful course to the south down John Day's Creek,
until it lost
itself in a swamp. Here they encamped upon the ice among stiffened willows, where they were
obliged to beat down and clear away the snow to procure pasturage for their horses.

<p>Hence they toiled on to Godin River; so called after an Iroquois hunter in the service of
Sublette,
who was murdered there by the Blackfeet. Many of the features of this remote wilderness are
thus
named after scenes of violence and bloodshed that occurred to the early pioneers. It was an act of
filial vengeance on the part of Godin's son Antoine that, as the reader may recollect, brought on
the
recent battle at Pierre's Hole.

<p>From Godin's River, Captain Bonneville and his followers came out upon the plain of the
Three
Butes, so called from three singular and isolated hills that rise from the midst. It is a part of the
great
desert of Snake River, one of the most remarkable tracts beyond the mountains. Could they have
experienced a respite from their sufferings and anxieties, the immense landscape spread out
before
them was calculated to inspire admiration. Winter has its beauties and glories as well as summer;
and Captain Bonneville had the soul to appreciate them.

<p>Far away, says he, over the vast plains, and up the steep sides of the lofty mountains, the
snow lay
spread in dazzling whiteness: and whenever the sun emerged in the morning above the giant
peaks,
or burst forth from among clouds in his midday course, mountain and dell, glazed rock and
frosted
tree, glowed and sparkled with surpassing lustre. The tall pines seemed sprinkled with a silver
dust,
and the willows, studded with minute icicles reflecting the prismatic rays, brought to mind the
fairy
trees conjured up by the caliph's story-teller to adorn his vale of diamonds.

<p>The poor wanderers, however, nearly starved with hunger and cold, were in no mood to
enjoy the
glories of these brilliant scenes; though they stamped pictures on their memory which have been
recalled with delight in more genial situations.

<p>Encamping at the west Bute, they found a place swept by the winds, so that it was bare of
snow, and
there was abundance of bunch grass.  Here the horses were turned loose to graze throughout the
night. Though for once they had ample pasturage, yet the keen winds were so intense that, in the
morning, a mule was found frozen to death.  The trappers gathered round and mourned over him
as
over a cherished friend. They feared their half-famished horses would soon share his fate, for
there
seemed scarce blood enough left in their veins to withstand the freezing cold. To beat the way
further
through the snow with these enfeebled animals seemed next to impossible; and despondency
began
to creep over their hearts, when, fortunately, they discovered a trail made by some hunting party.
Into this they immediately entered, and proceeded with less difficulty. Shortly afterward, a fine
buffalo bull came bounding across the snow and was instantly brought down by the hunters. A
fire
was soon blazing and crackling, and an ample repast soon cooked, and sooner dispatched; after
which they made some further progress and then encamped. One of the men reached the camp
nearly
frozen to death; but good cheer and a blazing fire gradually restored life, and put his blood in
circulation.

<p>Having now a beaten path, they proceeded the next morning with more facility; indeed, the
snow
decreased in depth as they receded from the mountains, and the temperature became more mild.
In
the course of the day they discovered a solitary horseman hovering at a distance before them on
the
plain. They spurred on to overtake him; but he was better mounted on a fresher steed, and kept at
a wary distance, reconnoitring them with evident distrust; for the wild dress of the free trappers,
their
leggings, blankets, and cloth caps garnished with fur and topped off with feathers, even their very
elf-locks and weather-bronzed complexions, gave them the look of Indians rather than white
men,
and made him mistake them for a war party of some hostile tribe.

<p>After much manoeuvring, the wild horseman was at length brought to a parley; but even then
he
conducted himself with the caution of a knowing prowler of the prairies. Dismounting from his
horse, and using him as a breastwork, he levelled his gun across his back, and, thus prepared for
defence like a wary cruiser upon the high seas, he permitted himself to be approached within
speaking distance.

<p>He proved to be an Indian of the Banneck tribe, belonging to a band at no great distance. It
was some
time before he could be persuaded that he was conversing with a party of white men and induced
to
lay aside his reserve and join them. He then gave them the interesting intelligence that there were
two companies of white men encamped in the neighborhood. This was cheering news to Captain
Bonneville; who hoped to find in one of them the long-sought party of Matthieu. Pushing
forward,
therefore, with renovated spirits, he reached Snake River by nightfall, and there fixed his
encampment.

<p>Early the next morning (13th January, 1833) , diligent search was made about the
neighborhood for
traces of the reported parties of white men. An encampment was soon discovered about four
miles
farther up the river, in which Captain Bonneville to his great joy found two of Matthieu's men,
from
whom he learned that the rest of his party would be there in the course of a few days. It was a
matter
of great pride and selfgratulation to Captain Bonneville that he had thus accomplished his dreary
and
doubtful enterprise; and he determined to pass some time in this encampment, both to await the
return of Matthieu, and to give needful repose to men and horses.

<p>It was, in fact, one of the most eligible and delightful wintering grounds in that whole range
of
country. The Snake River here wound its devious way between low banks through the great plain
of the Three Butes; and was bordered by wide and fertile meadows. It was studded with islands
which, like the alluvial bottoms, were covered with groves of cotton-wood, thickets of willow,
tracts
of good lowland grass, and abundance of green rushes. The adjacent plains were so vast in extent
that no single band of Indians could drive the buffalo out of them; nor was the snow of sufficient
depth to give any serious inconvenience. Indeed, during the sojourn of Captain Bonneville in this
neighborhood, which was in the heart of winter, he found the weather, with the exception of a
few
cold and stormy days, generally mild and pleasant, freezing a little at night but invariably
thawing
with the morning's sun-resembling the spring weather in the middle parts of the United States.

<p>The lofty range of the Three Tetons, those great landmarks of the Rocky Mountains rising in
the east
and circling away to the north and west of the great plain of Snake River, and the mountains of
Salt
River and Portneuf toward the south, catch the earliest falls of snow. Their white robes lengthen
as
the winter advances, and spread themselves far into the plain, driving the buffalo in herds to the
banks of the river in quest of food; where they are easily slain in great numbers.

<p>Such were the palpable advantages of this winter encampment; added to which, it was secure
from
the prowlings and plunderings of any petty band of roving Blackfeet, the difficulties of retreat
rendering it unwise for those crafty depredators to venture an attack unless with an overpowering
force.

<p>About ten miles below the encampment lay the Banneck Indians; numbering about one
hundred and
twenty lodges. They are brave and cunning warriors and deadly foes of the Blackfeet, whom they
easily overcome in battles where their forces are equal. They are not vengeful and enterprising in
warfare, however; seldom sending war parties to attack the Blackfeet towns, but contenting
themselves with defending their own territories and house. About one third of their warriors are
armed with fusees, the rest with bows and arrows.

<p>As soon as the spring opens they move down the right bank of Snake River and encamp at
the heads
of the Boisee and Payette. Here their horses wax fat on good pasturage, while the tribe revels in
plenty upon the flesh of deer, elk, bear, and beaver. They then descend a little further, and are
met
by the Lower Nez Perces, with whom they trade for horses; giving in exchange beaver, buffalo,
and
buffalo robes. Hence they strike upon the tributary streams on the left bank of Snake River, and
encamp at the rise of the Portneuf and Blackfoot streams, in the buffalo range. Their horses,
although
of the Nez Perce breed, are inferior to the parent stock from being ridden at too early an age,
being
often bought when but two years old and immediately put to hard work. They have fewer horses,
also, than most of these migratory tribes.

<p>At the time that Captain Bonneville came into the neighborhood of these Indians, they were
all in
mourning for their chief, surnamed The Horse. This chief was said to possess a charmed life, or
rather, to be invulnerable to lead; no bullet having ever hit him, though he had been in repeated
battles, and often shot at by the surest marksmen. He had shown great magnanimity in his
intercourse with the white men. One of the great men of his family had been slain in an attack
upon
a band of trappers passing through the territories of his tribe. Vengeance had been sworn by the
Bannecks; but The Horse interfered, declaring himself the friend of white men and, having great
influence and authority among his people, he compelled them to forcgo all vindictive plans and
to
conduct themselves amicably whenever they came in contact with the traders.

<p>This chief had bravely fallen in resisting an attack made by the Blackfeet upon his tribe,
while
encamped at the head of Godin River. His fall in nowise lessened the faith of his people in his
charmed life; for they declared that it was not a bullet which laid him low, but a bit of horn
which
had been shot into him by some Blackfoot marksman aware, no doubt, of the inefficacy of lead.
Since his death there was no one with sufficient influence over the tribe to restrain the wild and
predatory propensities of the young men.  The consequence was they had become troublesome
and
dangerous neighbors, openly friendly for the sake of traffic, but disposed to commit secret
depredations and to molest any small party that might fall within their reach.
