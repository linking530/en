<p> IT was the 3d of July that Captain Bonneville set out on his second visit to the banks of the
Columbia,
at the head of twenty-three men.  He travelled leisurely, to keep his horses fresh, until on the 10th
of
July a scout brought word that Wyeth, with his band, was but fifty miles in the rear, and pushing
forward with all speed.  This caused some bustle in the camp; for it was important to get first to
the
buffalo ground to secure provisions for the journey. As the horses were too heavily laden to travel
fast, a cache was digged, as promptly as possible, to receive all superfluous baggage. Just as it
was
finished, a spring burst out of the earth at the bottom. Another cache was therefore digged, about
two
miles further on; when, as they were about to bury the effects, a line of horsemen with
pack-horses,
were seen streaking over the plain, and encamped close by.

<p> It proved to be a small band in the service of the Hudson's Bay Company, under the
command of a
veteran Canadian; one of those petty leaders, who, with a small party of men, and a small supply
of
goods, are employed to follow up a band of Indians from one hunting ground to another, and buy
up
their peltries.

<p> Having received numerous civilities from the Hudson's Bay Company, the captain sent an
invitation
to the officers of the party to an evening regale; and set to work to make jovial preparations. As
the
night air in these elevated regions is apt to be cold, a blazing fire was soon made, that would have
done credit to a Christmas dinner, instead of a midsummer banquet. The parties met in high
good-fellowship. There was abundance of such hunters' fare as the neighborhood furnished; and it
was all
discussed with mountain appetites.  They talked over all the events of their late campaigns; but the
Canadian veteran had been unlucky in some of his transactions; and his brow began to grow
cloudy.
Captain Bonneville remarked his rising spleen, and regretted that he had no juice of the grape to
keep
it down.

<p> A man's wit, however, is quick and inventive in the wilderness; a thought suggested itself to
the
captain, how he might brew a delectable beverage.  Among his stores was a keg of honey but half
exhausted. This he filled up with alcohol, and stirred the fiery and mellifluous ingredients together. 
The glorious results may readily be imagined; a happy compound of strength and sweetness,
enough
to soothe the most ruffled temper and unsettle the most solid understanding.

<p> The beverage worked to a charm; the can circulated merrily; the first deep draught washed
out every
care from the mind of the veteran; the second elevated his spirit to the clouds.  He was, in fact, a
boon
companion; as all veteran Canadian traders are apt to be. He now became glorious; talked over all
his exploits, his huntings, his fightings with Indian braves, his loves with Indian beauties; sang
snatches of old French ditties, and Canadian boat songs; drank deeper and deeper, sang louder
and
louder; until, having reached a climax of drunken gayety, he gradually declined, and at length fell
fast
asleep upon the ground. After a long nap he again raised his head, imbibed another potation of the
"sweet and strong," flashed up with another slight blaze of French gayety, and again fell asleep.

<p> The morning found him still upon the field of action, but in sad and sorrowful condition;
suffering the
penalties of past pleasures, and calling to mind the captain's dulcet compound, with many a retch
and
spasm. It seemed as if the honey and alcohol, which had passed so glibly and smoothly over his
tongue, were at war within his stomach; and that he had a swarm of bees within his head. In short,
so helpless and woebegone was his plight, that his party proceeded on their march without him;
the
captain promised to bring him on in safety in the after part of the day.

<p> As soon as this party had moved off, Captain Bonneville's men proceeded to construct and
fill their
cache; and just as it was completed the party of Wyeth was descried at a distance. In a moment all
was activity to take the road.  The horses were prepared and mounted; and being lightened of a
great
part of their burdens, were able to move with celerity. As to the worthy convive of the preceding
evening, he was carefully gathered up from the hunter's couch on which he lay, repentant and
supine,
and, being packed upon one of the horses, was hurried forward with the convoy, groaning and
ejaculating at every jolt.

<p> In the course of the day, Wyeth, being lightly mounted, rode ahead of his party, and overtook
Captain
Bonneville. Their meeting was friendly and courteous; and they discussed, sociably, their
respective
fortunes since they separated on the banks of the Bighorn. Wyeth announced his intention of
establishing a small trading post at the mouth of the Portneuf, and leaving a few men there, with a
quantity of goods, to trade with the neighboring Indians.  He was compelled, in fact, to this
measure,
in consequence of the refusal of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company to take a supply of goods
which
he had brought out for them according to contract; and which he had no other mode of disposing
of. 
He further informed Captain Bonneville that the competition between the Rocky Mountain and
American Fur Companies which had led to such nefarious stratagems and deadly feuds, was at an
end;
they having divided the country between them, allotting boundaries within which each was to
trade
and hunt, so as not to interfere with the other.

<p> In company with Wyeth were travelling two men of science; Mr. Nuttall, the botanist; the
same who
ascended the Missouri at the time of the expedition to Astoria; and Mr. Townshend, an
ornithologist;
from these gentlemen we may look forward to important information concerning these interesting
regions. There were three religious missionaries, also, bound to the shores of the Columbia, to
spread
the light of the Gospel in that far wilderness.

<p> After riding for some time together, in friendly conversation, Wyeth returned to his party,
and Captain
Bonneville continued to press forward, and to gain ground. At night he sent off the sadly sober
and
moralizing chief of the Hudson's Bay Company, under a proper escort, to rejoin his people; his
route
branching off in a different direction. The latter took a cordial leave of his host, hoping, on some
future occasion, to repay his hospitality in kind.

<p> In the morning the captain was early on the march; throwing scouts out far ahead, to scour
hill and
dale, in search of buffalo.  He had confidently expected to find game in abundance, on the
head-waters of the Portneuf; but on reaching that region, not a track was to be seen.

<p> At length, one of the scouts, who had made a wide sweep away to the head-waters of the
Blackfoot
River, discovered great herds quietly grazing in the adjacent meadows. He set out on his return,
to
report his discoveries; but night overtaking him, he was kindly and hospitably entertained at the
camp
of Wyeth. As soon as day dawned he hastened to his own camp with the welcome intelligence;
and
about ten o'clock of the same morning, Captain Bonneville's party were in the midst of the game.

<p> The packs were scarcely off the backs of the mules, when the runners, mounted on the
fleetest horses,
were full tilt after the buffalo. Others of the men were busied erecting scaffolds, and other
contrivances, for jerking or drying meat; others were lighting great fires for the same purpose;
soon
the hunters began to make their appearance, bringing in the choicest morsels of buffalo meat;
these
were placed upon the scaffolds, and the whole camp presented a scene of singular hurry and
activity.
At daylight the next morning, the runners again took the field, with similar success; and, after an
interval of repose made their third and last chase, about twelve o'clock; for by this time, Wyeth's
party
was in sight. The game being now driven into a valley, at some distance, Wyeth was obliged to fix
his camp there; but he came in the evening to pay Captain Bonneville a visit. He was accompanied
by Captain Stewart, the amateur traveller; who had not yet sated his appetite for the adventurous
life
of the wilderness. With him, also, was a Mr. M'Kay, a half-breed; son of the unfortunate
adventurer
of the same name who came out in the first maritime expedition to Astoria and was blown up in
the
<em>Tonquin. </em>His son had grown up in the employ of the British fur companies; and was a
prime hunter,
and a daring partisan. He held, moreover, a farm in the valley of the Wallamut.

<p> The three visitors, when they reached Captain Bonneville's camp, were surprised to find no
one in it
but himself and three men; his party being dispersed in all directions, to make the most of their
present
chance for hunting. They remonstrated with him on the imprudence of remaining with so trifling a
guard in a region so full of danger. Captain Bonneville vindicated the policy of his conduct.  He
never
hesitated to send out all his hunters, when any important object was to be attained; and experience
had taught him that he was most secure when his forces were thus distributed over the
surrounding
country. He then was sure that no enemy could approach, from any direction, without being
discovered by his hunters; who have a quick eye for detecting the slightest signs of the proximity
of
Indians; and who would instantly convey intelligence to the camp.

<p> The captain now set to work with his men, to prepare a suitable entertainment for his guests.
It was
a time of plenty in the camp; of prime hunters' dainties; of buffalo humps, and buffalo tongues;
and
roasted ribs, and broiled marrow-bones: all these were cooked in hunters' style; served up with a
profusion known only on a plentiful hunting ground, and discussed with an appetite that would
astonish
the puny gourmands of the cities.  But above all, and to give a bacchanalian grace to this truly
masculine repast, the captain produced his mellifluous keg of home-brewed nectar, which had
been
so potent over the senses of the veteran of Hudson's Bay. Potations, pottle deep, again went
round;
never did beverage excite greater glee, or meet with more rapturous commendation. The parties
were
fast advancing to that happy state which would have insured ample cause for the next day's
repentance; and the bees were already beginning to buzz about their ears, when a messenger came
spurring to the camp with intelligence that Wyeth's people had got entangled in one of those deep
and
frightful ravines, piled with immense fragments of volcanic rock, which gash the whole country
about
the head-waters of the Blackfoot River. The revel was instantly at an end; the keg of sweet and
potent
home-brewed was deserted; and the guests departed with all speed to aid in extricating their
companions from the volcanic ravine.
