<p>GAME continued to abound throughout the winter, and the camp was overstocked with
provisions.
Beef and venison, humps and haunches, buffalo tongues and marrow-bones, were constantly
cooking
at every fire; and the whole atmosphere was redolent with the savory fumes of roast meat. It was,
indeed, a continual "feast of fat things," and though there might be a lack of "wine upon the lees,"
yet
we have shown that a substitute was occasionally to be found in honey and alcohol.

  <p>Both the Shoshonies and the Eutaws conducted themselves with great propriety. It is true,
they
now and then filched a few trifles from their good friends, the Big Hearts, when their backs were
turned; but then, they always treated them to their faces with the utmost deference and respect,
and
good-humoredly vied with the trappers in all kinds of feats of activity and mirthful sports. The
two
tribes maintained toward each other, also a friendliness of aspect which gave Captain Bonneville
reason to hope that all past animosity was effectually buried.

<p>The two rival bands, however, had not long been mingled in this social manner before their
ancient
jealousy began to break out in a new form. The senior chief of the Shoshonies was a thinking
man,
and a man of observation. He had been among the Nez Perces, listened to their new code of
morality
and religion received from the white men, and attended their devotional exercises. He had
observed
the effect of all this, in elevating the tribe in the estimation of the white men; and determined, by
the
same means, to gain for his own tribe a superiority over their ignorant rivals, the Eutaws. He
accordingly assembled his people, and promulgated among them the mongrel doctrines and form
of worship
of the Nez Perces; recommending the same to their adoption. The Shoshonies were struck with
the
novelty, at least, of the measure, and entered into it with spirit. They began to observe Sundays
and
holidays, and to have their devotional dances, and chants, and other ceremonials, about which the
ignorant Eutaws knew nothing; while they exerted their usual competition in shooting and
horseracing, and the renowned game of hand.

<p>Matters were going on thus pleasantly and prosperously, in this motley community of white
and red
men, when, one morning, two stark free trappers, arrayed in the height of savage finery, and
mounted
on steeds as fine and as fiery as themselves, and all jingling with hawks' bells, came galloping, with
whoop and halloo, into the camp.

<p>They were fresh from the winter encampment of the American Fur Company, in the Green
River
Valley; and had come to pay their old comrades of Captain Bonneville's company a visit. An idea
may
be formed from the scenes we have already given of conviviality in the wilderness, of the manner
in
which these game birds were received by those of their feather in the camp; what feasting, what
revelling, what boasting, what bragging, what ranting and roaring, and racing and gambling, and
squabbling and fighting, ensued among these boon companions. Captain Bonneville, it is true,
maintained always a certain degree of law and order in his camp, and checked each fierce excess;
but
the trappers, in their seasons of idleness and relaxation require a degree of license and indulgence,
to
repay them for the long privations and almost incredible hardships of their periods of active
service.

<p>In the midst of all this feasting and frolicking, a freak of the tender passion intervened, and
wrought
a complete change in the scene. Among the Indian beauties in the camp of the Eutaws and
Shoshonies, the free trappers discovered two, who had whilom figured as their squaws. These
connections frequently take place for a season, and sometimes continue for years, if not
perpetually;
but are apt to be broken when the free trapper starts off, suddenly, on some distant and rough
expedition.

<p>In the present instance, these wild blades were anxious to regain their belles; nor were the
latter loath
once more to come under their protection. The free trapper combines, in the eye of an Indian girl,
all
that is dashing and heroic in a warrior of her own race -- whose gait, and garb, and bravery he
emulates -- with all that is gallant and glorious in the white man. And then the indulgence with
which
he treats her, the finery in which he decks her out, the state in which she moves, the sway she
enjoys
over both his purse and person; instead of being the drudge and slave of an Indian husband,
obliged
to carry his pack, and build his lodge, and make his fire, and bear his cross humors and dry blows.
No;
there is no comparison in the eyes of an aspiring belle of the wilderness, between a free trapper
and
an Indian brave.

<p>With respect to one of the parties the matter was easily arranged. 'The beauty in question was
a pert
little Eutaw wench, that had been taken prisoner, in some war excursion, by a Shoshonie. She was
readily ransomed for a few articles of trifling value; and forthwith figured about the camp in fine
array, "with rings on her fingers, and bells on her toes," and a tossed-up coquettish air that made
her
the envy, admiration, and abhorrence of all the leathern-dressed, hard-working squaws of her
acquaintance.

<p>As to the other beauty, it was quite a different matter. She had become the wife of a
Shoshonie brave.
It is true, he had another wife, of older date than the one in question; who, therefore, took
command
in his household, and treated his new spouse as a slave; but the latter was the wife of his last
fancy,
his latest caprice; and was precious in his eyes. All attempt to bargain with him, therefore, was
useless; the very proposition was repulsed with anger and disdain. The spirit of the trapper was
roused, his pride was piqued as well as his passion. He endeavored to prevail upon his quondam
mistress to elope with him. His horses were fleet, the winter nights were long and dark, before
daylight they would be beyond the reach of pursuit; and once at the encampment in Green River
Valley, they might set the whole band of Shoshonies at defiance.

<p>The Indian girl listened and longed.  Her heart yearned after the ease and splendor of
condition of a
trapper's bride, and throbbed to be free from the capricious control of the premier squaw; but she
dreaded the failure of the plan, and the fury of a Shoshonie husband. They parted; the Indian girl
in
tears, and the madcap trapper more than ever, with his thwarted passion.

<p>Their interviews had, probably, been detected, and the jealousy of the Shoshonie brave
aroused: a
clamor of angry voices was heard in his lodge, with the sound of blows, and of female weeping
and
lamenting. At night, as the trapper lay tossing on his pallet, a soft voice whispered at the door of
his
lodge. His mistress stood trembling before him.  She was ready to follow whithersoever he should
lead.

<p>In an instant he was up and out. He had two prime horses, sure and swift of foot, and of great
wind.
With stealthy quiet, they were brought up and saddled; and in a few moments he and his prize
were
careering over the snow, with which the whole country was covered. In the eagerness of escape,
they
had made no provision for their journey; days must elapse before they could reach their haven of
safety, and mountains and prairies be traversed, wrapped in all the desolation of winter. For the
present, however they thought of nothing but flight; urging their horses forward over the dreary
wastes, and fancying, in the howling of every blast, they heard the yell of the pursuer.

<p>At early dawn, the Shoshonie became aware of his loss. Mounting his swiftest horse, he set
off in hot
pursuit. He soon found the trail of the fugitives, and spurred on in hopes of overtaking them. The
winds, however, which swept the valley, had drifted the light snow into the prints made by the
horses'
hoofs. In a little while he lost all trace of them, and was completely thrown out of the chase. He
knew, however, the situation of the camp toward which they were bound, and a direct course
through
the mountains, by which he might arrive there sooner than the fugitives. Through the most rugged
defiles, therefore, he urged his course by day and night, scarce pausing until he reached the camp.
It
was some time before the fugitives made their appearance. Six days had they traversed the wintry
wilds. They came, haggard with hunger and fatigue, and their horses faltering under them. The
first
object that met their eyes on entering the camp was the Shoshonie brave. He rushed, knife in
hand,
to plunge it in the heart that had proved false to him. The trapper threw himself before the
cowering
form of his mistress, and, exhausted as he was, prepared for a deadly struggle. The Shoshonie
paused.
His habitual awe of the white man checked his arm; the trapper's friends crowded to the spot, and
arrested him. A parley ensued. A kind of <em>crim. con. </em>adjudication took place; such as
frequently occurs
in civilized life. A couple of horses were declared to be a fair compensation for the loss of a
woman
who had previously lost her heart; with this, the Shoshonie brave was fain to pacify his passion. 
He
returned to Captain Bonneville's camp, somewhat crestfallen, it is true; but parried the officious
condolements of his friends by observing that two good horses were very good pay for one bad
wife.
