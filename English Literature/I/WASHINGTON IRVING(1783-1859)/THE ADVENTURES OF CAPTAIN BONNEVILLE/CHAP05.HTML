<p> IT WAS ON THE 20TH of July that Captain Bonneville first came in sight of the grand
region of his hopes and anticipations, the Rocky Mountains. He had been making a
bend to the south, to avoid some obstacles along the river, and had attained a high,
rocky ridge, when a magnificent prospect burst upon his sight. To the west rose the
Wind River Mountains, with their bleached and snowy summits towering into the clouds.
These stretched far to the north-northwest, until they melted away into what appeared
to be faint clouds, but which the experienced eyes of the veteran hunters of the party
recognized for the rugged mountains of the Yellowstone; at the feet of which extended
the wild Crow country: a perilous, though profitable region for the trapper. 


<p> To the southwest, the eye ranged over an immense extent of wilderness, with what
appeared to be a snowy vapor resting upon its horizon. This, however, was pointed out
as another branch of the Great Chippewyan, or Rocky chain; being the Eutaw
Mountains, at whose basis the wandering tribe of hunters of the same name pitch their
tents. We can imagine the enthusiasm of the worthy captain when he beheld the vast
and mountainous scene of his adventurous enterprise thus suddenly unveiled before
him. We can imagine with what feelings of awe and admiration he must have
contemplated the Wind River Sierra, or bed of mountains; that great fountainhead from
whose springs, and lakes, and melted snows some of those mighty rivers take their
rise, which wander over hundreds of miles of varied country and clime, and find their
way to the opposite waves of the Atlantic and the Pacific. 


<p> The Wind River Mountains are, in fact, among the most remarkable of the whole Rocky
chain; and would appear to be among the loftiest. They form, as it were, a great bed of
mountains, about eighty miles in length, and from twenty to thirty in breadth; with
rugged peaks, covered with eternal snows, and deep, narrow valleys full of springs, and
brooks, and rock-bound lakes. From this great treasury of waters issue forth limpid
streams, which, augmenting as they descend, become main tributaries of the Missouri
on the one side, and the Columbia on the other; and give rise to the Seeds-ke-dee
Agie, or Green River, the great Colorado of the West, that empties its current into the
Gulf of California. 


<p> The Wind River Mountains are notorious in hunters' and trappers' stories: their rugged
defiles, and the rough tracts about their neighborhood, having been lurking places for
the predatory hordes of the mountains, and scenes of rough encounter with Crows and
Blackfeet. It was to the west of these mountains, in the valley of the Seeds-ke-dee Agie,
or Green River, that Captain Bonneville intended to make a halt for the purpose of
giving repose to his people and his horses after their weary journeying; and of collecting
information as to his future course. This Green River valley, and its immediate
neighborhood, as we have already observed, formed the main point of rendezvous, for
the present year, of the rival fur companies, and the motley populace, civilized and
savage, connected with them. Several days of rugged travel, however, yet remained for
the captain and his men before they should encamp in this desired resting-place. 


<p> On the 21st of July, as they were pursuing their course through one of the meadows of
the Sweet Water, they beheld a horse grazing at a little distance. He showed no alarm
at their approach, but suffered himself quietly to be taken, evincing a perfect state of
tameness. The scouts of the party were instantly on the look-out for the owners of this
animal; lest some dangerous band of savages might be lurking in the vicinity. After a
narrow search, they discovered the trail of an Indian party, which had evidently passed
through that neighborhood but recently. The horse was accordingly taken possession
of, as an estray; but a more vigilant watch than usual was kept round the camp at
nights, lest his former owners should be upon the prowl. 


<p> The travellers had now attained so high an elevation that on the 23d of July, at
daybreak, there was considerable ice in the waterbuckets, and the thermometer stood
at twenty-two degrees. The rarefy of the atmosphere continued to affect the wood-work
of the wagons, and the wheels were incessantly falling to pieces. A remedy was at
length devised. The tire of each wheel was taken off; a band of wood was nailed round
the exterior of the felloes, the tire was then made red hot, replaced round the wheel,
and suddenly cooled with water. By this means, the whole was bound together with
great compactness. 


<p> The extreme elevation of these great steppes, which range along the feet of the Rocky
Mountains, takes away from the seeming height of their peaks, which yield to few in the
known world in point of altitude above the level of the sea. 


<p> On the 24th, the travellers took final leave of the Sweet Water, and keeping westwardly,
over a low and very rocky ridge, one of the most southern spurs of the Wind River
Mountains, they encamped, after a march of seven hours and a half, on the banks of a
small clear stream, running to the south, in which they caught a number of fine trout. 


<p> The sight of these fish was hailed with pleasure, as a sign that they had reached the
waters which flow into the Pacific; for it is only on the western streams of the Rocky
Mountains that trout are to be taken. The stream on which they had thus encamped
proved, in effect, to be tributary to the Seeds-ke-dee Agie, or Green River, into which it
flowed at some distance to the south. 


<p> Captain Bonneville now considered himself as having fairly passed the crest of the
Rocky Mountains; and felt some degree of exultation in being the first individual that
had crossed, north of the settled provinces of Mexico, from the waters of the Atlantic to
those of the Pacific, with wagons. Mr. William Sublette, the enterprising leader of the
Rocky Mountain Fur Company, had, two or three years previously, reached the valley of
the Wind River, which lies on the northeast of the mountains; but had proceeded with
them no further.


<p> A vast valley now spread itself before the travellers, bounded on one side by the Wind
River Mountains, and to the west, by a long range of high hills. This, Captain Bonneville
was assured by a veteran hunter in his company, was the great valley of the Seedske-dee; and the
same informant would have fain persuaded him that a small stream, three
feet deep, which he came to on the 25th, was that river. The captain was convinced,
however, that the stream was too insignificant to drain so wide a valley and the adjacent
mountains: he encamped, therefore, at an early hour, on its borders, that he might take
the whole of the next day to reach the main river; which he presumed to flow between
him and the distant range of western hills. 


<p> On the 26th of July, he commenced his march at an early hour, making directly across
the valley, toward the hills in the west; proceeding at as brisk a rate as the jaded
condition of his horses would permit. About eleven o'clock in the morning, a great cloud
of dust was descried in the rear, advancing directly on the trail of the party. The alarm
was given; they all came to a halt, and held a council of war. Some conjectured that the
band of Indians, whose trail they had discovered in the neighborhood of the stray horse,
had been lying in wait for them in some secret fastness of the mountains; and were
about to attack them on the open plain, where they would have no shelter. Preparations
were immediately made for defence; and a scouting party sent off to reconnoitre. They
soon came galloping back, making signals that all was well. The cloud of dust was
made by a band of fifty or sixty mounted trappers, belonging to the American Fur
Company, who soon came up, leading their pack-horses. They were headed by Mr.
Fontenelle, an experienced leader, or "partisan," as a chief of a party is called in the
technical language of the trappers. 


<p> Mr. Fontenelle informed Captain Bonneville that he was on his way from the company's
trading post on the Yellowstone to the yearly rendezvous, with reinforcements and
supplies for their hunting and trading parties beyond the mountains; and that he
expected to meet, by appointment, with a band of free trappers in that very
neighborhood. He had fallen upon the trail of Captain Bonneville's party, just after
leaving the Nebraska; and, finding that they had frightened off all the game, had been
obliged to push on, by forced marches, to avoid famine: both men and horses were,
therefore, much travel-worn; but this was no place to halt; the plain before them he said
was destitute of grass and water, neither of which would be met with short of the Green
River, which was yet at a considerable distance. He hoped, he added, as his party were
all on horseback, to reach the river, with hard travelling, by nightfall: but he doubted the
possibility of Captain Bonneville's arrival there with his wagons before the day following.
Having imparted this information, he pushed forward with all speed. 


<p> Captain Bonneville followed on as fast as circumstances would permit. The ground was
firm and gravelly; but the horses were too much fatigued to move rapidly. After a long
and harassing day's march, without pausing for a noontide meal, they were compelled,
at nine o'clock at night, to encamp in an open plain, destitute of water or pasturage. On
the following morning, the horses were turned loose at the peep of day; to slake their
thirst, if possible, from the dew collected on the sparse grass, here and there springing
up among dry sand-banks. The soil of a great part of this Green River valley is a whitish
clay, into which the rain cannot penetrate, but which dries and cracks with the sun. In
some places it produces a salt weed, and grass along the margins of the streams; but
the wider expanses of it are desolate and barren. It was not until noon that Captain
Bonneville reached the banks of the Seeds-ke-dee, or Colorado of the West; in the
meantime, the sufferings of both men and horses had been excessive, and it was with
almost frantic eagerness that they hurried to allay their burning thirst in the limpid
current of the river. 


<p> Fontenelle and his party had not fared much better; the chief part had managed to
reach the river by nightfall, but were nearly knocked up by the exertion; the horses of
others sank under them, and they were obliged to pass the night upon the road. 


<p> On the following morning, July 27th, Fontenelle moved his camp across the river; while
Captain Bonneville proceeded some little distance below, where there was a small but
fresh meadow yielding abundant pasturage. Here the poor jaded horses were turned
out to graze, and take their rest: the weary journey up the mountains had worn them
down in flesh and spirit; but this last march across the thirsty plain had nearly finished
them.


<p> The captain had here the first taste of the boasted strategy of the fur trade. During his
brief, but social encampment, in company with Fontenelle, that experienced trapper had
managed to win over a number of Delaware Indians whom the captain had brought with
him, by offering them four hundred dollars each for the ensuing autumnal hunt. The
captain was somewhat astonished when he saw these hunters, on whose services he
had calculated securely, suddenly pack up their traps, and go over to the rival camp.
That he might in some measure, however, be even with his competitor, he dispatched
two scouts to look out for the band of free trappers who were to meet Fontenelle in this
neighborhood, and to endeavor to bring them to his camp. 


<p> As it would be necessary to remain some time in this neighborhood, that both men and
horses might repose, and recruit their strength; and as it was a region full of danger,
Captain Bonneville proceeded to fortify his camp with breastworks of logs and pickets.


<p> These precautions were, at that time, peculiarly necessary, from the bands of Blackfeet
Indians which were roving about the neighborhood. These savages are the most
dangerous banditti of the mountains, and the inveterate foe of the trappers. They are
Ishmaelites of the first order, always with weapon in hand, ready for action. The young
braves of the tribe, who are destitute of property, go to war for booty; to gain horses,
and acquire the means of setting up a lodge, supporting a family, and entitling
themselves to a seat in the public councils. The veteran warriors fight merely for the
love of the thing, and the consequence which success gives them among their people. 


<p> They are capital horsemen, and are generally well mounted on short, stout horses,
similar to the prairie ponies to be met with at St. Louis. When on a war party, however,
they go on foot, to enable them to skulk through the country with greater secrecy; to
keep in thickets and ravines, and use more adroit subterfuges and stratagems. Their
mode of warfare is entirely by ambush, surprise, and sudden assaults in the night time.
If they succeed in causing a panic, they dash forward with headlong fury: if the enemy
is on the alert, and shows no signs of fear, they become wary and deliberate in their
movements. 


<p> Some of them are armed in the primitive style, with bows and arrows; the greater part
have American fusees, made after the fashion of those of the Hudson's Bay Company.
These they procure at the trading post of the American Fur Company, on Marias River,
where they traffic their peltries for arms, ammunition, clothing, and trinkets. They are
extremely fond of spirituous liquors and tobacco; for which nuisances they are ready to
exchange not merely their guns and horses, but even their wives and daughters. As
they are a treacherous race, and have cherished a lurking hostility to the whites ever
since one of their tribe was killed by Mr. Lewis, the associate of General Clarke, in his
exploring expedition across the Rocky Mountains, the American Fur Company is
obliged constantly to keep at that post a garrison of sixty or seventy men. 


<p> Under the general name of Blackfeet are comprehended several tribes: such as the
Surcies, the Peagans, the Blood Indians, and the Gros Ventres of the Prairies: who
roam about the southern branches of the Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers, together
with some other tribes further north. 


<p> The bands infesting the Wind River Mountains and the country adjacent at the time of
which we are treating, were Gros Ventres of the <em>Prairies</em>, which are not to be
confounded with Gros Ventres of the <em>Missouri</em>, who keep about the
<em>lower</em> part of that
river, and are friendly to the white men. 


<p> This hostile band keeps about the headwaters of the Missouri, and numbers about nine
hundred fighting men. Once in the course of two or three years they abandon their
usual abodes, and make a visit to the Arapahoes of the Arkansas. Their route lies either
through the Crow country, and the Black Hills, or through the lands of the Nez Perces,
Flatheads, Bannacks, and Shoshonies. As they enjoy their favorite state of hostility with
all these tribes, their expeditions are prone to be conducted in the most lawless and
predatory style; nor do they hesitate to extend their maraudings to any party of white
men they meet with; following their trails; hovering about their camps; waylaying and
dogging the caravans of the free traders, and murdering the solitary trapper. The
consequences are frequent and desperate fights between them and the
"mountaineers," in the wild defiles and fastnesses of the Rocky Mountains. 


<p> The band in question was, at this time, on their way homeward from one of their
customary visits to the Arapahoes; and in the ensuing chapter we shall treat of some
bloody encounters between them and the trappers, which had taken place just before
the arrival of Captain Bonneville among the mountains.
