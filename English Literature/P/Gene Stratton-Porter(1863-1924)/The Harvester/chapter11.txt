DEMONSTRATED COURTSHIP



When the Harvester saw the Girl coming toward

the woods, he spread the rug, opened and

placed the table and chair, laid out the colour

box, and another containing the last luna.



``Did the green one come out?'' she asked, touching

the box lightly.



``It did!'' said the Harvester proudly, as if he were

responsible for the performance.  ``It is an omen!  It

means that I am to have my long-coveted pattern for

my best candlestick.  It also clearly indicates that

the gods of luck are with me for the day, and I

get my way about everything.  There won't be the

least use in your asking `why' or interposing objections. 

This is my clean sweep.  I shall be fearfully

dictatorial and you must submit, because the fates

have pointed out that they favour me to-day, and

if you go contrary to their decrees you will have a

bad time.''



The Girl's smile was a little wan.  She sank on a chair

and picked up a pencil.



``Lay that down!'' cried the Harvester.  ``You haven't

had permission from the Dictator to begin drawing.  You

are to sit and rest a long time.''



``Please may I speak?'' asked the Girl.



The Harvester grew foolishly happy.  Was she really

going to play the game?  Of course he had hoped, but

it was a hope without any foundation.



``You may,'' he said soberly.



``I am afraid that if you don't allow me to draw the

moth at once, I'll never get it done.  I dislike to mention

it on your good day, but Aunt Molly is very restless.  I

got a neighbour's little girl to watch her and call me if

I'm wanted.  It's quite certain that I must go soon, so if

you would like the moth----''



``When luck is coming your way, never hurry it!  You

always upset the bowl if you grow greedy and crowd. 

If it is a gamble whether I get this moth, I'll take the

chance; but I won't change my foreordained programme

for this afternoon.  First, you are to sit still ten minutes,

shut your eyes, and rest.  I can't sing, but I can whistle,

and I'm going to entertain you so you won't feel alone. 

Ready now!''



The Girl leaned her elbows on the table, closed her

eyes, and pressed her slender white hands over them.



``Please don't call the birds,'' she said.  ``I can't rest

if you do.  It was so exciting trying to see all of them

and guess what they were saying.''



``No,'' said the Harvester gently.  ``This ten minutes

is for relaxation, you know.  You ease every muscle,

sink limply on your chair, lean on the table, let go all

over, and don't think.  Just listen to me.  I assure you

it's going to be perfectly lovely.''



Watching intently he saw the strained muscles

relaxing at his suggestion and caught the smile over the

last words as he slid into a soft whistle.  It was an

easy, slow, old-fashioned tune, carrying along gently,

with neither heights nor depths, just monotonous, sleepy,

soothing notes, that went on and on with a little ripple

of change at times, only to return to the theme, until at

last the Girl lifted her head.



``It's away past ten minutes,'' she said, ``but that was

a real rest.  Truly, I am better prepared for work.''



``Broke the rule, too!'' said the Harvester.  ``It was,

for me to say when time was up.  Can't you allow me

to have my way for ten minutes?''



``I am so anxious to see and draw this moth,'' she

answered.  ``And first of all you promised to bring the

drawings you have been using.''



``Now where does my programme come in?'' inquired

the Harvester.  ``You are spoiling everything, and I

refuse to have my lucky day interfered with; therefore

we will ignore the suggestion until we arrive at the place

where it is proper.  Next thing is refreshments.''



He arose and coming over cleared the table.  Then

he spread on it a paper tray cloth with a gay border,

and going into the thicket brought out a box and a big

bucket containing a jug packed in ice.  The Girl's eyes

widened.  She reached down, caught up a piece, and

holding it to drip a second started to put it in her mouth.



``Drop that!'' commanded the Harvester.  ``That's

a very unhealthful proceeding.  Wait a minute.''



From one end of the box he produced a tin of wafers

and from the other a plate.  Then he dug into the ice

and lifted several different varieties of chilled fruit.  From

the jug he poured a combination that he made of the

juices of oranges, pineapples, and lemons.  He set the

glass, rapidly frosting in the heat, and the fruit before

the Girl.



``Now!'' he said.



For one instant she stared at the table.  Then she

looked at him and in the depths of her dark eyes was an

appeal he never forgot.



``I made that drink myself, so it's all right,'' he

assured her.  ``There's a pretty stiff touch of pineapple

in it, and it cuts the cobwebs on a hot day.  Please

try it!''



``I can't!'' cried the Girl with a half-sob.  ``Think of

Aunt Molly!''



``Are you fond of her?''



``No.  I never saw her until a few weeks ago.  Since

then I've seen nothing save her poor, tired back.  She lies

in a heap facing the wall.  But if she could have things

like these, she needn't suffer.  And if my mother could

have had them she would be living to-day.  Oh Man,

I can't touch this.''



``I see,'' said the Harvester.



He reached over, picked up the glass, and poured its

contents into the jug.  He repacked the fruit and closed

the wafer box.  Then he made a trip to the thicket and

came out putting something into his pocket.



``Come on!'' he said.  ``We are going to the house.''



She stared at him.



``I simply don't dare.''



``Then I will go alone,'' said the Harvester, picking

up the bucket and starting.



The Girl followed him.



``Uncle Henry may come any minute,'' she urged.



``Well if he comes and acts unpleasantly, he will get

what he richly deserves.''



``And he will make me pay for it afterward.''



``Oh no he won't!'' said the Harvester, ``because I'll

look out for that.  This is my lucky day.  He isn't going

to come.''



When he reached the back door he opened it and

stepped inside.  Of all the barren places of crude,

disheartening ugliness the Harvester ever had seen, that was

the worst.



``I want a glass and a spoon,'' he said.



The Girl brought them.



``Where is she?''



``In the next room.''



At the sound of their voices a small girl came to the

kitchen door.



``How do you do?'' inquired the Harvester.  ``Is Mrs.

Jameson asleep?''



``I don't know,'' answered the child.  ``She just lies

there.''



The Harvester gave her the glass.  ``Please fill that

with water,'' he said.  Then he picked up the bucket and

went into the front room.  When the child came with

the water he took a bottle from his pocket, filled the spoon,

and handed it to her.



``Hold that steadily,'' he said.



Then he slid his strong hands under the light frame and

turned the face of the faded little creature toward him.



``I am a Medicine Man, Mrs. Jameson,'' he said casually. 

``I heard you were sick and I came to see if a

little of this stuff wouldn't brace you up.  Open your

lips.''



He held out the spoon and the amazed woman swallowed

the contents before she realized what she was

doing.  Then the Harvester ran a hand under her shoulders

and lifting her gently he tossed her pillow with

the other hand.



``You are a light little body, just like my mother,''

he commented.  ``Now I have something else sick people

sometimes enjoy.''



He held the fruit juice to her lips as he slightly raised

her on the pillow.  Her trembling fingers lifted and

closed around the sparkling glass.



``Oh it's cool!'' she gasped.



``It is,'' said the Harvester, ``and sour!  I think you

can taste it.  Try!''



She drank so greedily he drew away the glass and

urged caution, but the shaking fingers clung to him and

the wavering voice begged for more.



``In a minute,'' said the Harvester gently.  But the

fevered woman would not wait.  She drank the cooling

liquid until she could take no more.  Then she watched

him fill a small pitcher and pack it in a part of the ice

and lay some fruit around it.



``Who, Ruth?'' she panted.



``A Medicine Man who heard about you.''



``What will Henry say?''



``He won't know,'' explained the Girl, smoothing the

hot forehead.  ``I'll put it in the cupboard, and slip it

to you while he is out of the room.  It will make you

strong and well.''



``I don't want to be strong and well and suffer it all

over again.  I want to rest.  Give me more of the cool

drink.  Give me all I want, then I'll go to sleep.''



``It's wonderful,'' said the Girl.  ``That's more than

I've heard her talk since I came.  She is much stronger. 

Please let her have it.''



The Harvester assented.  He gave the child some of

the fruit, and told her to sit beside the bed and hold the

drink when it was asked for.  She agreed to be very

careful and watchful.  Then he picked up the bucket,

and followed by the Girl, returned to the woods.



``Now we have to begin all over again,'' he said, as

she seated herself at the table.  ``Because of the walk in

the heat, this time the programme is a little different.''



He replaced the wafer box and opened it, filled the

glass, and heaped the cold fruit.



``Your aunt is going to have a refreshing sleep now,''

he said, ``and your mind can be free about her for an hour

or two.  I am very sure your mother would not want you

deprived of anything because she missed it, so you are

to enjoy this, if you care for it.  At least try a sample.''



The Girl lifted the glass to her lips with a trembling

hand.



``I'm like Aunt Molly,'' she said; ``I wish I could drink

all I could swallow, and then lie down and go to sleep

forever.  I suppose this is what they have in Heaven.''



``No, it's what they drink all over earth at present,

but I have a conceit of my own brand.  Some of it is

too strong of one fruit or of the other, and all too sweet

for health.  This is compounded scientifically and it's

just right.  If you are not accustomed to cold drinks,

go slowly.''



``You can't scare me,'' said the Girl; ``I'm going to

drink all I want.''



There was a note of excitement in the Harvester's

laugh.



``You must have some, too!''



``After a while,'' he said.  ``I was thirsty when I made

it, so I don't care for any more now.  Try the fruit and


those wafers.  Of course they are not home made--

they are the best I could do at a bakery.  Take time

enough to eat slowly.  I'm going to tell you a tale while

you lunch, and it's about a Medicine Man named David

Langston.  It's a very peculiar story, but it's quite

true.  This man lives in the woods east of Onabasha,

accompanied by his dog, horse, cow, and chickens, and

a forest full of birds, flowers, and matchless trees.  He

has lived there in this manner for six long years, and

every spring he and his dog have a seance and agree

whether he shall go on gathering medicinal herbs and

trying his hand at making medicine or go to the city

and live as other men.  Always the dog chooses to remain

in the woods.



``Then every spring, on the day the first bluebird comes,

the dog also decides whether the man shall go on alone

or find a mate and bring her home for company.  Each

year the dog regularly has decided that they live as

always.  This spring, for some unforeseen reason, he

changed his mind, and compelled the man, according to

his vow in the beginning, to go courting.  The man was

so very angry at the idea of having a woman in his home,

interfering with his work, disturbing his arrangements,

and perhaps wanting to spend more money than he could

afford, that he struck the dog for making that decision;

struck him for the very first time in his life----I believe

you'd like those apricots.  Please try one.''



``Go on with the story,'' said the Girl, sipping

delicately but constantly at the frosty glass.



The Harvester arose and refilled it.  Then he dropped

pieces of ice over the fruit.



``Where was I?'' he inquired casually.



``Where you struck Belshazzar, and it's no wonder,''

answered the Girl.



Without taking time to ponder that, the Harvester

continued:



``But that night the man had a wonderful, golden

dream.  A beautiful girl came to him, and she was so

gracious and lovely that he was sufficiently punished

for striking his dog, because he fell unalterably in love

with her.''



``Meaning you?'' interrupted the Girl.



``Yes,'' said the Harvester, ``meaning me.  I----if

you like----fell in love with the girl.  She came so

alluringly, and I was so close to her that I saw her better

than I ever did any other girl, and I knew her for all time. 

When she went, my heart was gone.''



``And you have lived without that important organ

ever since?''



``Without even the ghost of it!  She took it with her. 

Well, that dream was so real, that the next day I began

building over my house, making furniture, and planting

flowers for her; and every day, wherever I went, I watched

for her.''



``What nonsense!''



``I can't see it.''



``You won't find a girl you dreamed about in a

thousand years.''



``Wrong!'' cried the Harvester triumphantly.  ``Saw

her in little less than three months, but she vanished and

it took some time and difficult work before I located

her again; but I've got her all solid now, and she doesn't

escape.''



``Is she a `lovely and gracious lady'?''



``She is!'' said the Harvester, with all his heart.



``Young and beautiful, of course!''



``Indeed yes!''



``Please fill this glass.  I told you what I was going

to do.''



The Harvester refilled the glass and the Girl drained it.



``Now won't you set aside these things and allow me

to go to work?'' she asked.  ``My call may come any

minute, and I'll never forgive myself if I waste time, and

don't draw your moth pattern for you.''



``It's against my principles to hurry, and besides, my

story isn't finished.''



``It is,'' said the Girl.  ``She is young and lovely, gentle

and a lady, you have her `all solid,' and she can't `escape';

that's the end, of course.  But if I were you, I wouldn't

have her until I gave her a chance to get away, and saw

whether she would if she could.''



``Oh I am not a jailer,'' said the Harvester.  ``She shall

be free if I cannot make her love me; but I can, and I

will; I swear it.''



``You are not truly in earnest?''



``I am in deadly earnest.''



``Honestly, you dreamed about a girl, and found the

very one?''



``Most certainly, I did.''



``It sounds like the wildest romancing.''



``It is the veriest reality.''



``Well I hope you win her, and that she will be

everything you desire.''



``Thank you,'' said the Harvester.  ``It's written in

the book of fate that I succeed.  The very elements are

with me.  The South Wind carried a message to her for

me.  I am going to marry her, but you could make it

much easier for me if you would.''



``I!  What could I do?'' cried the Girl.



``You could cease being afraid of me.  You could

learn to trust me.  You could try to like me, if you see

anything likeable about me.  That would encourage me

so that I could tell you of my Dream Girl, and then you

could show me how to win her.  A woman always knows

about those things better than a man.  You could be the

greatest help in all the world to me, if only you would.''



``I couldn't possibly!  I can't leave here.  I have no

proper clothing to appear before another girl.  She would

be shocked at my white face.  That I could help you is

the most improbable dream you have had.''



``You must pardon me if I differ from you, and persist

in thinking that you can be of invaluable assistance to

me, if you will.  But you can't influence my Dream

Girl, if you fear and distrust me yourself.  Promise me

that you will help me that much, anyway.''



``I'll do all I can.  I only want to make you see that

I am in no position to grant any favours, no matter how

much I owe you or how I'd like to.  Is the candlestick

you are carving for her?''



``It is,'' said the Harvester.  ``I am making a pair of

maple to stand on a dressing table I built for her.  It is

unusually beautiful wood, I think, and I hope she will

be pleased with it.''



``Please take these things away and let me begin.  This

is the only thing I can see that I can do for you, and the

moth will want to fly before I have finished.''



The Harvester cleared the table and placed the box,

while the Girl spread the paper and began work eagerly.



``I wonder if I knew there were such exquisite things

in all the world,'' she said.  ``I scarcely think I did.  I am

beginning to understand why you couldn't kill one.  You

could make a chair or a table, and so you feel free to destroy

them; but it takes ages and Almighty wisdom to evolve

a creature like this, so you don't dare.  I think no one else

would if they really knew.  Please talk while I work.''



``Is there a particular subject you want discussed?''



``Anything but her.  If I think too strongly of her, I

can't work so well.''



``Your ginseng is almost dry,'' said the Harvester. 

``I think I can bring you the money in a few days.''



``So soon!'' she cried.



``It dries day and night in an even temperature, and

faster than you would believe.  There's going to be

between seven and eight pounds of it, when I make up

what it has shrunk.  It will go under the head of the

finest wild roots.  I can get eight for it sure.''



``Oh what good news!'' cried the Girl.  ``This is my

lucky day, too.  And the little girl isn't coming, so Aunt

Molly must be asleep.  Everything goes right!  If only

Uncle Henry wouldn't come home!''



``Let me fill your glass,'' proffered the Harvester.



``Just half way, and set it where I can see it,'' said the

Girl.  She worked with swift strokes and there was a

hint of colour in her face, as she looked at him.  ``I

hope you won't think I'm greedy,'' she said, ``but truly,

that's the first thing I've had that I could taste in----I

can't remember when.''



``I'll bring a barrel to-morrow,'' offered the Harvester,

``and a big piece of ice wrapped in coffee sacking.''



``You mustn't think of such a thing!  Ice is expensive

and so are fruits.''



``Ice costs me the time required to saw and pack it at

my home.  I almost live on the fruit I raise.  I confess

to a fondness for this drink.  I have no other personal

expenses, unless you count in books, and a very few

clothes, such as I'm wearing; so I surely can afford all

the fruit juice I want.''



``For yourself, yes.''



``Also for a couple of women or I am a mighty poor

attempt at a man,'' said the Harvester.  ``This is my

day, so you are not to talk, because it won't do any good. 

Things go my way.''



``Please see what you think of this,'' she said.



The Harvester arose and bent over her.



``That will do finely,'' he answered.  ``You can stop. 

I don't require all those little details for carving, I just

want a good outline.  It is finished.  See here!''



He drew some folded papers from his pocket and laid

them before her.



``Those are what I have been working from,'' he said.



The Girl took them and studied each carefully.



``If those are worth five dollars to you,'' she said gently,

``why then I needn't hesitate to take as much for mine. 

They are superior.''



``I should say so,'' laughed the Harvester as he took

up the drawing and laid down the money.



``If you would make it half that much I'd feel better

about it,'' she said.



``How could I?'' asked the Harvester.  ``Your fingers

are well trained and extremely skilful.  Because some

one has not been paying you enough for your work is

no reason why I should keep it up.  From now on you

must have what others get.  As soon as you can arrange

for work, I want to tell you about some designs I have

studied out from different things, show you the plants

and insects, and have you make some samples.  I'll

send them to proper places, and see what experts say

about the ideas and drawing.  Work in the woods is

healthful, with proper precautions; it's easy compared

with the exactions of being bound to sewing or embroidering

in the confinement of a room; it's vividly interesting

in the search for new subjects, changes of material, and

differing harmonious combinations; it's truly artistic; and

it brings the prices high grade stuff always does.''



``Almost you give me hope,'' said the Girl.  ``Almost,

Man----almost!  Since mother died, I haven't thought

or planned beyond paying for the medicine she took and

the shelter she lies in.  Oh I didn't mean to say that----!''



She buried her face in her hands.  The Harvester

suffered until he scarcely knew how to bear it.



``Please finish,'' he begged.  ``You hadn't planned

beyond the debt, you were saying----''



The Girl lifted her tired, strained face.



``Give me a little more of that delicious drink,'' she

said.  ``I am ravenous for it.  It puts new life in me. 

This and what you say bring a far away, misty vision

of a clean, bright, peaceful room somewhere, and work

one could love and live on in comfort; enough to give a

desire to finish life to its natural end.  Oh Man, you

make me hope in spite of myself!''



`` `Praise God from whom all blessings flow;' '' quoted

the Harvester reverently.  ``Now try one of these peaches. 

It's juicy and cold.  Get that room right in focus in your

brain, and nurture the idea.  Its walls shall be bright

as sunshine, its floor creamy white, and it shall open

into a little garden, where only yellow flowers grow, and

the birds shall sing.  The first ray of sun that peeps

over the hills of morning shall fall through its windows

across your bed, and you shall work only as you please,

after you've had months of play and rest; and it's coming

true the instant you can leave here.  Dream of

it, make up your mind to it, because it's coming.  I

have a little streak of second sight, and I see it on the

way.''



``You are talking wildly,'' said the Girl, ``else you are

a good genie trying to conjure a room for me.''



``This room I am talking of is ready whenever you want

to take possession,'' said the Harvester.  ``Accept it as

a reality, because I tell you I know where it is, that it

is waiting, and you can earn your way into it with no

obligation to any one.''



The Girl stretched out her right hand and slowly turned

and opened and closed it.  Then she glanced at the Harvester

with a weary smile.



``From somewhere I feel a glimmering of the spirit,

but Oh, dear Lord, the flesh is weak!'' she said.



``That's where nourishing foods, appetizing drinks,

plenty of pure, fresh air, and good water come in.  Now

we have talked enough for one day, and worked too

much.  The fruit and drink go with you.  I will carry

it to the house, and you can hide it in your room.  I am

going to put a bottle of tonic on top that the best surgeon

in the state gave me for you.  Try to eat something

strengthening and then take a spoonful of this, and use

all the fruit you want.  I'll bring more to-morrow and

put it here, with plenty of ice.  Now suppose you let

the moth go free,'' he suggested to avoid objections. 

``You must take my word for it, that it is perfectly harmless,

lacking either sting or bite, and hold your hand before

it, so that it will climb on your fingers.  Then stand

where a ray of sunshine falls and in a few minutes it will

go out to live its life.''



The Girl hesitated a second as she studied the clean-cut,

interested face of the man; then she held out her hand,

and he urged the moth to climb on her fingers.  She

stepped where a ray of strong light fell on the forest floor

and held the moth in it.  The brightness also touched

her transparent hand and white face and the gleaming

black hair.  The Harvester choked down a rising surge

of desire for her, and took a new grip on himself.



``Oh!'' she cried breathlessly, as the clinging feet

suddenly loosened and the luna slowly flew away among the

trees.  She turned on the Harvester.  ``You teach me

wonders!'' she cried.  ``You give life different meanings. 

You are not as other men.''



``If that be true, it is because I am of the woods.  The

Almighty does not evolve all his wonders in animal,

bird, and flower form; He keeps some to work out in

the heart, if humanity only will go to His school, and allow

Him to have dominion.  Come now, you must go.  I

will come back and put away all the things and tomorrow 

I will bring your ginseng money.  Any time you

cannot come, if you want to tell me why, or if there is

anything I can do for you, put a line under the oilcloth. 

I will carry the bucket.''



``I am so afraid,'' she said.



``I will only go to the edge of the woods.  You can

see if there is any one at the house first.  If not, you can

send the child away, and then I will carry the bucket to

the door for you, and it will furnish comfort for one night,

at least.''



They went to the cleared land and the Girl passed on

alone.  Soon she reappeared and the Harvester saw the

child going down the road.  He took up the bucket and

set it inside the door.



``Is there anything I can do for you?''



``Nothing but go, before you make trouble.''



``Will you hide that stuff and walk back as far as the

woods with me?  There is something more I want to

say to you.''



The Girl staggered under the heavy load, and the man

turned his head and tried to pretend he did not see. 

Presently she came out to him, and they returned to

the line of the woods.  Just as they entered the shade

there was a flash before them, and on a twig a few rods

away a little gray bird alighted, while in precipitate

pursuit came a flaming wonder of red, and in a burst

of excited trills, broken whistles, and imploring gestures,

perched beside her.



The Harvester hastily drew the Girl behind some

bushes.



``Watch!'' he whispered.  ``You are going to see a

sight so lovely and so rare it is vouchsafed to few mortals

ever to behold.''



``What are they fighting about?'' she whispered.



``You are witnessing a cardinal bird declare his love,''

breathed the Harvester.



``Do cardinals love different birds?''



``No.  The female is gray, because if she is coloured

the same as the trees and branches and her nest, she

will have more chance to bring off her young in safety. 

He is blood red, because he is the bravest, gayest, most

ardent lover of the whole woods,'' explained the Harvester.



The Girl leaned forward breathlessly watching and a

slow surge of colour crept into her cheeks.  The red bird

twisted, whistled, rocked, tilted, and trilled, and the gray

sat demurely watching him, as if only half convinced

he really meant it.  The gay lover began at the beginning

and said it all over again with more impassioned gestures

than before, and then he edged in touch and softly

stroked her wing with his beak.  She appeared startled,

but did not fly.  So again the fountain of half-whistled,

half-trilled notes bubbled with the acme of pleading

intonation and that time he leaned and softly kissed her

as she reached her bill for the caress.  Then she fled in

headlong flight, while the streak of flame darted after her. 

The Girl caught her breath in a swift spasm of surprise

and wonder.  She turned to the Harvester.



``What was it you wanted to say to me?'' she asked

hurriedly.



The Harvester was not the man to miss the goods the

gods provided.  Truly this was his lucky day.  Unhesitatingly

he took the plunge.



``Precisely what he said to her.  And if you observed

closely, you noticed that she didn't ask him `why.' ''



Before she could open her lips, he was gone, his swift

strides carrying him through the woods.
