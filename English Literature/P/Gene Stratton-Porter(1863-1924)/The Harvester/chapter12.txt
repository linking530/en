``THE WAY OF A MAN WITH A MAID''



The next day the Harvester lifted the oilcloth,

and picking up a folded note he read----



``Aunt Molly found rest in the night.  She was

more comfortable than she had been since I have known

her.  Close the end she whispered to me to thank you

if I ever saw you again.  She will be buried to-morrow. 

Past that, I dare not think.''



The Harvester sat on the log and studied the lines. 

She would not come that day or the next.  After a long

time he put the note in his pocket, wrote an answer

telling her he had been there, and would come on the

following day on the chance of her wanting anything

he could do, and the next he would bring the ginseng

money, so she must be sure to meet him.



Then he went back to the wagon, turned Betsy, and

drove around the Jameson land watching closely.  There

were several vehicles in the barn lot, and a couple of

men sitting under the trees of the door yard.  Faded

bedding hung on the line and women moved through

the rooms, but he could not see the Girl.  Slowly he

drove on until he came to the first house, and there he

stopped and went in.  He saw the child of the previous

day, and as she came forward her mother appeared in

the doorway.



The Harvester explained who he was and that he was

examining the woods in search of some almost extinct

herbs he needed in his business.  Then he told of having

been at the adjoining farm the day before and mentioned

the sick woman.  He added that later she had died. 

He casually mentioned that a young woman there seemed

pale and ill and wondered if the neighbours would see

her through.  He suggested that the place appeared as

if the owner did not take much interest, and when the

woman finished with Henry Jameson, he said how very

important it seemed to him that some good, kind-hearted

soul should go and mother the poor girl, and the woman

thought she was the very person.  Without knowing

exactly how he did it, the Harvester left with her promise

to remain with the Girl the coming two nights.  The

woman had her hands full of strange and delicious fruit

without understanding why it had been given her, or

why she had made those promises.  She thought the

Harvester a remarkably fine young man to take such

interest in strangers and she told him he was welcome

to anything he could find on her place that would help

with his medicines.



The Harvester just happened to be coming from the

woods as the woman freshly dressed left the house, so

he took her in the wagon and drove back to the Jameson

place, because he was going that way.  Then he returned

to Medicine Woods and worked with all his might.



First he polished floors, cleaned windows, and arranged

the rooms as best he could inside the cabin; then he

gave a finishing touch to everything outside.  He could

not have told why he did it, but he thought it was

because there was hope that now the Girl would come

to Onabasha.  If he found opportunity to bring her

to the city, he hoped that possibly he might drive home

with her and show Medicine Woods, so everything must

be in order.  Then he worked with flying fingers in the

dry-house, putting up her ginseng for market, and never

was weight so liberal.



The next morning he drove early to Onabasha and

came home with a loaded wagon, the contents of which

he scattered through the cabin where it seemed most

suitable, but the greater part of it was for her.  He

glanced at the bare floors and walls of the other rooms,

and thought of trying to improve them, but he was

afraid of not getting the right things.



``I don't know much about what is needed here,''

he said, ``but I am perfectly safe in buying anything a

girl ever used.''



Then he returned to the city, explained the situation

to the doctor, and selected the room he wanted in case

the Girl could be persuaded to come to the hospital. 

After that he went to see the doctor's wife, and made

arrangements for her to be ready for a guest, because

there was a possibility he might want to call for help. 

He had another jug of fruit juice and all the delicacies

he could think of, also a big cake of ice, when he

reached the woods.  There were only a few words for

him.



``I will come to-morrow at two, if at all possible; if

not, keep the money until I can.''



There was nothing to do except to place his offering

under the oilcloth and wait, but he simply was compelled

to add a line to say he would be there, and to express

the hope that she was comfortable as possible and thinking

of the sunshine room.  Then he returned to Medicine

Woods to wait, and found that possible only by

working to exhaustion.  There were many things he

could do, and one after another he finished them, until

completely worn out; and then he slept the deep sleep

of weariness.



At noon the next day he bathed, shaved, and dressed

in fresh, clean clothing.  He stopped in Onabasha for

more fruit, and drove to the Jameson woods.  He was

waiting and watching the usual path the Girl followed,

when her step sounded on the other side.  The Harvester

arose and turned.  Her pallor was alarming.  She stepped

on the rug he had spread, and sank almost breathless

to the chair.



``Why do you come a new way that fills you with fear?''

asked the Harvester.



``It seems as if Uncle Henry is watching me every

minute, and I didn't dare come where he could see.  I

must not remain a second.  You must take these things

away and go at once.  He is dreadful.''



``So am I,'' said the Harvester, ``when affairs go too

everlastingly wrong.  I am not afraid of any man living. 

What are you planning to do?''



``I want to ask you, are you sure about the prices of

my drawing and the ginseng?''



``Absolutely,'' said the Harvester.  ``As for the ginseng

it went in fresh and early, best wild roots, and it

brought eight a pound.  There were eight pounds when

I made up weight and here is your money.''



He handed her a long envelope addressed to her.



``What is the amount?'' she asked.



``Sixty-four dollars.''



``I can't believe it.''



``You have it in your fingers.''



``You know that I would like to thank you properly,

if I had words to express myself.''



``Never mind that,'' said the Harvester.  ``Tell me

what you are planning.  Say that you will come to the

hospital for the long, perfect rest now.''



``It is absolutely impossible.  Don't weary me by

mentioning it.  I cannot.''



``Will you tell me what you intend doing?''



`I must,'' she said, ``for it depends entirely on your

word.  I am going to get Uncle Henry's supper, and then

go and remain the night with the neighbour who has

been helping me.  In the morning, when he leaves, she

is coming with her wagon for my trunk, and she is going

to drive with me to Onabasha and find me a cheap room

and loan me a few things, until I can buy what I need. 

I am going to use fourteen dollars of this and my drawing

money for what I am forced to buy, and pay fifty on

my debt.  Then I will send you my address and be

ready for work.''



She clutched the envelope and for the first time looked

at him.



``Very well,'' said the Harvester.  ``I could take you

to the wife of my best friend, the chief surgeon of

the city hospital, and everything would be ease

and rest until you are strong; she would love to have

you.''



The Girl dropped her hands wearily.



``Don't tire me with it!'' she cried.  ``I am almost

falling despite the stimulus of food and drink I can

touch.  I never can thank you properly for that.  I

won't be able to work hard enough to show you how

much I appreciate what you have done for me.  But

you don't understand.  A woman, even a poverty-poor

woman, if she be delicately born and reared, cannot go

to another woman on a man's whim, and when she

lacks even the barest necessities.  I don't refuse to meet

your friends.  I shall love to, when I can be so dressed

that I will not shame you.  Until that times comes, if

you are the gentleman you appear to be, you will wait

without urging me further.''



``I must be a man, in order to be a gentleman,'' said

the Harvester.  ``And it is because the man in me is

in hot rebellion against more loneliness, pain, and suffering

for you, that the conventions become chains I do

not care how soon or how roughly I break.  If only you 

could be induced to say the word, I tell you I could bring

one of God's gentlest women to you.''



``And probably she would come in a dainty gown,

in her carriage or motor, and be disgusted, astonished,

and secretly sorry for you.  As for me, I do not require

her pity.  I will be glad to know the beautiful, refined,

and gentle woman you are so certain of, but not until

I am better dressed and more attractive in appearance

than now.  If you will give me your address, I will write

you when I am ready for work.''



Silently the Harvester wrote it.  ``Will you give me

permission to take these things to your neighbour for

you?'' he asked.  ``They would serve until you can do

better, and I have no earthly use for them.''



She hesitated.  Then she laughed shortly.



``What a travesty my efforts at pride are with you!''

she cried.  ``I begin by trying to preserve some proper

dignity, and end by confessing abject poverty.  I yet

have the ten you paid me the other day, but twenty-four

dollars are not much to set up housekeeping on, and

I would be more glad than I can say for these very

things.''



``Thank you,'' said the Harvester.  ``I will take them

when I go.  Is there anything else?''



``I think not.''



``Will you have a drink?''



``Yes, if you have more with you.  I believe it is really

cooling my blood.''



``Are you taking the medicine?''



``Yes,'' she said, ``and I am stronger.  Truly I am. 

I know I appear ghastly to you, but it's loss of sleep,

and trying to lay away poor Aunt Molly decently,

and----''



``And fear of Uncle Henry,'' added the Harvester.



``Yes,'' said the Girl.  ``That most of all!  He thinks

I am going to stay here and take her place.  I can't

tell him I am not, and how I am to hide from him when

I am gone, I don't know.  I am afraid of him.''



``Has he any claim on you?''



``Shelter for the past three months.''



``Are you of age?''



``I am almost twenty-four,'' she said.



``Then suppose you leave Uncle Henry to me,''

suggested the Harvester.



``Why?''



``Careful now!  The red bird told you why!'' said

the man.  ``I will not urge it upon you now, but keep

it steadily in the back of your head that there is a

sunshine room all ready and waiting for you, and I am going

to take you to it very soon.  As things are, I think you

might allow me to tell you----''



She was on her feet in instant panic.  ``I must go,''

she said.  ``Uncle Henry is dogging me to promise to

remain, and I will not, and he is watching me.  I must

go----''



``Can you give me your word of honour that you will

go to the neighbour woman to-night; that you feel

perfectly safe?''



She hesitated.  ``Yes, I----I think so.  Yes, if he

doesn't find out and grow angry.  Yes, I will be safe.''



``How soon will you write me?''



``Just as soon as I am settled and rest a little.''



``Do you mean several days?''



``Yes, several days.''



``An eternity!'' cried the Harvester with white lips. 

``I cannot let you go.  Suppose you fall ill and fail to

write me, and I do not know where you are, and there

is no one to care for you.''



``But can't you see that I don't know where I will

be?  If it will satisfy you, I will write you a line to-

morrow night and tell you where I am, and you can come

later.''



``Is that a promise?'' asked the Harvester.



``It is,'' said the Girl.



``Then I will take these things to your neighbour and

wait until to-morrow night.  You won't fail me?''



``I never in all my life saw a man so wild over designs,''

said the Girl, as she started toward the house.



``Don't forget that the design I'm craziest about is

the same as the red bird's,'' the Harvester flung after

her, but she hurried on and made no reply.



He folded the table and chair, rolled the rug, and

shouldering them picked up the bucket and started down

the river bank.



``David!''



Such a faint little call he never would have been sure

he heard anything if Belshazzar had not stopped suddenly.  

The hair on the back of his neck arose and he

turned with a growl in his throat.  The Harvester dropped

his load with a crash and ran in leaping bounds, but the

dog was before him.  Half way to the house, Ruth Jameson

swayed in the grip of her uncle.  One hand clutched

his coat front in a spasmodic grasp, and with the other

she covered her face.



The roar the Harvester sent up stayed the big, lifted

fist, and the dog leaped for a throat hold, and compelled

the man to defend himself.  The Harvester never knew

how he covered the space until he stood between them,

and saw the Girl draw back and snatch together the

front of her dress.



``He took it from me!'' she panted.  ``Make him, oh

make him give back my money!''



Then for a few seconds things happened too rapidly to

record.  Once the Harvester tossed a torn envelope

exposing money to the Girl, and again a revolver, and

then both men panting and dishevelled were on their

feet.



``Count your money, Ruth?'' said the Harvester in a

voice of deadly quiet.



``It is all here,'' said she.



``Her money?'' cried Henry Jameson.  ``My money! 

She has been stealing the price of my cattle from my

pockets.  I thought I was short several times lately.''



``You are lying,'' said the Harvester deliberately. 

``It is her money.  I just paid it to her.  You were trying

to take it from her, not the other way.''



``Oh, she is in your pay?'' leered the man.



``If you say an insulting word I think very probably

I will finish you,'' said the Harvester.  ``I can, with my

naked hands, and all your neighbours will say it is a

a good job.  You have felt my grip!  I warn you!''



``How does my niece come to be taking money from you!''



``You have forfeited all right to know.  Ruth, you

cannot remain here.  You must come with me.  I will

take you to Onabasha and find you a room.''



A horrible laugh broke from the man.



``So that is the end of my saintly niece!'' he said.



``Remember!'' cried the Harvester advancing a step. 

``Ruth, will you go to the rest I suggested for you?''



``I cannot.''



``Will you go to Doctor Carey's wife?''



``Impossible!''



``Will you marry me and go to the shelter of my home

with me?''



Wild-eyed she stared at him.



``Why?''



``Because I love you, and want life made easier for

you, above anything else on earth.''



``But your Dream Girl!''



``YOU ARE THE DREAM GIRL!  I thought the red bird told

you for me!  I didn't know it would be a shock.  I

believed I had made you understand.''



By that time she was shaking with a nervous chill,

and the sight unmanned the Harvester.



``Come with me!'' he urged.  ``We will decide what

you want to do on the way.  Only come, I beg you.''



``First it was marry, now it's decide later,'' broke in

Henry Jameson, crazed with anger.  ``Move a step

and I'll strike you down.  I'd better than see you

disgraced----''



The Harvester advanced and Jameson stepped back.



``Ruth,'' said the Harvester, ``I know how impossible

this seems.  It is giving you no chance at all.  I had

intended, when I found you, to court you tenderly as

girl ever was wooed before.  Come with me, and I'll

do it yet.  The new home was built for you.  The

sunshine room is ready and waiting for you.  There is

pure air, fresh water, nothing but rest and comfort. 

I'll nurse you back to health and strength, and you shall

be courted until you come to me of your own accord.''



``Impossible!'' cried the girl.



``Only if you make it so.  If you will come now, we

can be married in a few hours, and you can be safe in

your own home.  I realize now that this is unexpected and

shocking to you, but if you will come with me and allow

me to restore you to health and strength, and if, say, in

a year, you are convinced that you do not love me, I

will set you free.  If you will come, I swear to you that you

shall be my wife first, and my honoured guest afterward,

until such time as you either tell me you love me or that

you never can.  Will you come on those terms, Ruth?''



``I cannot!''



``It will end fear, uncertainty, and work, until you

are strong and well.  It will give you home, rest, and

love, that you will find is worth your consideration.  I

will keep my word; of that you may be sure.''



``No,'' she cried.  ``No!  But take back this money! 

Keep it until I tell you to whom to pay it.''



She started toward him holding out the envelope.



Henry Jameson, with a dreadful oath, sprang for it,

his contorted face a drawn snarl.  The Harvester caught

him in air and sent him reeling.  He snatched the revolver

from the Girl and put the money in his pocket.



``Ruth, I can't leave you here,'' he said.  ``Oh my

Dream Girl!  Are you afraid of me yet?  Won't you

trust me?  Won't you come?''



``No.''



``You are right about that, my lady; you will come

back to the house, that's what you'll do,'' said Henry

Jameson, starting toward her.



``No!'' cried the Girl retreating.  ``Oh Heaven help

me!  What am I to do?''



``Ruth, you must come with me,'' said the Harvester. 

``I don't dare leave you here.''



She stood between them and gave Henry Jameson

one long, searching look.  Then she turned to the Harvester.



``I am far less afraid of you.  I will accept your offer,''

she said.



``Thank you!'' said the Harvester.  ``I will keep my

word and you shall have no regrets.  Is there anything

here you wish to take with you?''



``I want a little trunk of my mother's.  It contains

some things of hers.''



``Will you show me where it is?''



She started toward the house; he followed, and Henry

Jameson fell in line.  The Harvester turned on him. 

``You remain where you are,'' he said.  ``I will take

nothing but the trunk.  I know what you are thinking,

but you will not get your gun just now.  I will return

this revolver to-morrow.''



``And the first thing I do with it will be to use it on

you,'' said Henry Jameson.



``I'll report that threat to the police, so that they

can see you properly hanged if you do,'' retorted the

Harvester, as he followed the girl.



``Where is his gun?'' he asked as he overtook her. 

When he reached the house he told her to watch the

door.  He went inside, broke the lock from the gun in

the corner, found the trunk, and swinging it to his

shoulder, passed Henry Jameson and went back through

the woods.  The Harvester set the trunk in the wagon,

helped the Girl in, and returned for the load he had

dropped at her call.  Then he took the lines and started

for Onabasha.



The Girl beside him was almost fainting.  He stopped

to give her a drink and tried to encourage her.



``Brace up the best you can, Ruth,'' he said.  ``You

must go with me for a license; that is the law.  Afterward,

I'll make it just as easy for you as possible.  I

will do everything, and in a few hours you will be

comfortable in your room.  You brave girl!  This must

come out right!  You have suffered more than your

share.  I will have peace for you the remainder of the

way.''



She lifted shaking hands and tried to arrange her

hair and dress.  As they neared the city she spoke.



``What will they ask me?''



``I don't know.  But I am sure the law requires you

to appear in person now.  I can take you somewhere

and find out first.''



``That will take time.  I want to reach my room. 

What would you think?''



``If you are of age, where you were born, if you are

a native of this country, what your father and mother

died of, how old they were, and such questions as that. 

I'll help you all I can.  You know those things.  don't

you?''



``Yes.  But I must tell you----''



``I don't want to be told anything,'' said the Harvester. 

``Save your strength.  All I want to know is any way

in which I can make this easier for you.  Nothing else

matters.  I will tell you what I think; if you have any

objections, make them.  I will drive to the bank and get

a draft for what you owe, and have that off your mind. 

Then we will get the license.  After that I'll take you

to the side door, slip you in the elevator and to the

fitting room of a store where I know the manager, and

you shall have some pretty clothing while I arrange for

a minister, and I'll come for you with a carriage.  That

isn't the kind of wedding you or any other girl should

have, but there are times when a man only can do his

best.  You will help me as much as you can, won't

you?''



``Anything you choose.  It doesn't matter----only

be quick as possible.''



``There are a few details to which I must attend,''

said the Harvester, ``and the time will go faster trying

on dresses than waiting alone.  When you are properly

clothed you will feel better.  What did you say the

amount you owe is?''



``You may get a draft for fifty dollars.  I will pay the

remainder when I earn it.''



``Ruth, won't you give me the pleasure of taking you

home free from the worry of that debt?''



``I am not going to `worry.'  I am going to work and

pay it.''



``Very well,'' said the Harvester.  ``This is the bank. 

We will stop here.''



They went in and he handed her a slip of paper.



``Write the name and address on that?'' he said.



As the slip was returned to him, without a glance he

folded it and slid it under a wicket.  ``Write a draft

for fifty dollars payable to that party, and send to that

address, from Miss Ruth Jameson,'' he said.



Then he turned to her.



``That is over.  See how easy it is!  Now we will go

to the court house.  It is very close.  Try not to think. 

Just move and speak.''



``Hello, Langston!'' said the clerk.  ``What can we do

for you here?''



``Show this girl every consideration,'' whispered the

Harvester, as he advanced.  ``I want a marriage license in

your best time.  I will answer first.''



With the document in his possession, they went to

the store he designated, where he found the Girl a chair

in the fitting room, while he went to see the manager.



``I want one of your most sensible and accommodating

clerks,'' said the Harvester, ``and I would like a few words

with her.''



When she was presented he scrutinized her carefully

and decided she would do.



``I have many thanks and something more substantial

for a woman who will help me to carry through a slightly

unusual project with sympathy and ability,'' he said,

``and the manager has selected you.  Are you willing?''



``If I can,'' said the clerk.



``She has put up your other orders,'' interposed the

manager; ``were they satisfactory?''



``I don't know,'' said the Harvester.  ``They have not

yet reached the one for whom they were intended.  What

I want you to do,'' he said to the clerk, ``is to go to the

fitting room and dress the girl you find there for her

wedding.  She had other plans, but death disarranged

them, and she has only an hour in which to meet the

event most girls love to linger over for months.  She

has been ill, and is worn with watching; but some time

she may look back to her wedding day with joy, and if

only you would help me to make the best of it for her,

I would be, as I said, under more obligations than I can

express.''



`` I will do anything,'' said the clerk.



``Very well,'' said the Harvester.  ``She has come from

the country entirely unprepared.  She is delicate and

refined.  Save her all the embarrassment you can.  Dress

her beautifully in white.  Keep a memorandum slip of

what you spend for my account.''



``What is the limit?'' asked the clerk.



``There is none,'' said the Harvester.  ``Put the prettiest

things on her you have in the right sizes, and if you are

a woman with a heart, be gentle!''



``Is she ready?'' inquired the manager at the door an

hour later.



``I am,'' said the Girl stepping through.



The astounded Harvester stood and stared, utterly

oblivious of the curious people.



``Here, here, here!'' suddenly he whistled it, in the

red bird's most entreating tones.



The Girl laughed and the colour in her face deepened.



``Let us go,'' she said.



``But what about you?'' asked the manager of the

Harvester.



``Thunder!'' cried the man aghast.  ``I was so busy

getting everything else ready, I forgot all about myself. 

I can't stand before a minister beside her, can I?''



``Well I should say not,'' said the manager.



``Indeed yes,'' said the Girl.  ``I never saw you in

any other clothing.  You would be a stranger of whom

I'd be afraid.''



``That settles it!'' said the Harvester calmly.  ``Thank

all of you more than words can express.  I will come in

the first of the week and tell you how we get along.''



Then they went to the carriage and started for the

residence of a minister.



``Ruth, you are my Dream Girl to the tips of your

eyelashes,'' said the Harvester.  ``I almost wish you

were not.  It wouldn't keep me thinking so much of the

remainder of that dream.  You are the loveliest sight

I ever saw.''



``Do I really appear well?'' asked the Girl, hungry

for appreciation.



``Indeed you do!'' said the Harvester.  ``I never could

have guessed that such a miracle could be wrought.  And

you don't seem so tired.  Were they good to you?''



``Wonderfully!  I did not know there was kindness

like that in all the world for a stranger.  I did not feel

lost or embarrassed, except the first few seconds when

I didn't know what to do.  Oh I thank you for this! 

You were right.  Whatever comes in life I always shall

love to remember that I was daintily dressed and

appeared as well as I could when I was married.  But

I must tell you I am not real.  They did everything

on earth to me, three of them working at a time.  I feel

an increase in self-respect in some way.  David, I do

appear better?''



When she said ``David,'' the Harvester looked out of

the window and gulped down his delight.  He leaned

toward her.



``Shut your eyes and imagine you see the red bird,''

he said.  ``In my soul, I am saying to you again and

again just what he sang.  You are wonderfully beautiful,

Ruth, and more than wonderfully sweet.  Will you

answer me a question?''



``If I can.''



``I love you with all my heart.  Will you marry me?''



``I said I would.''



``Then we are engaged, aren't we?''



``Yes.''



``Please remove the glove from your left hand.  I want

to put on your ring.  This will have to be a very short

engagement, but no one save ourselves need know.''



``David, that isn't necessary.''



``I have it here, and believe me, Ruth, it will help in a

few minutes; and all your life you will be glad.  It is a

precious symbol that has a meaning.  This wedding won't

be hurt by putting all the sacredness into it we can. 

Please, Ruth!''



``On one condition.''



``What is it?''



``That you will accept and wear my mother's wedding

ring in exchange,'' she said.  ``It is all I have.''



``Ruth, do you really wish that?''



``I do.''



``I am more pleased than I can tell you.  May I have

it now?''



She took off her glove and the Harvester held her

hand closely a second, then lifted it to his lips, passionately

kissed it and slipped on a ring, the setting a big,

lustrous pearl.



``I looked at some others,'' he said, ``but nothing

got a second glance save this.  They knew you were

coming down the ages, and so they got the pearls ready. 

How beautiful it is on your hand!  Put on the glove

and wear that ring as if you had owned it for the long,

happy year of betrothal every girl should have.  You

can start yours to-day, and if by this time next year I

have not won you to my heart and arms, I'm no man

and not worthy of you.  Ruth, you will try just a little

to love me, won't you?''



``I will try with all my heart,'' she said instantly.



``Thank you!  I am perfectly happy with that.  I

never expected to marry you before a year, anyway. 

All the difference will be the blessed fact that instead

of coming to see you somewhere else, I now can have

you in my care, and court you every minute.  You

might as well make up your mind to capitulate soon. 

It's on the books that you do.''



``If an instant ever comes when I realize that I love

you, I will come straight and tell you; believe me, I

will.''



``Thank you!'' said the Harvester.  ``This is going

to be quite a proper wedding after all.  Here is the

place.  It will be over soon and you on the home way. 

Lord, Ruth----!''



The Girl smiled at him as he opened the carriage door,

helped her up the steps and rang the bell.



``Be brave now!'' he whispered.  ``Don't lose your

lovely colour.  These people will be as kind as they were

at the store.''



The minister was gentle and wasted no time.  His

wife and daughter, who appeared for witnesses, kissed

Ruth, and congratulated her.  She and the Harvester

stood, took the vows, exchanged rings, and returned to

the carriage, a man and his wife by the laws of

man.



``Drive to Seaton's cafe','' the Harvester said.



``Oh David, let us go home!''



``This is so good I hate to stop it for something you

may not like so well.  I ordered lunch and if we don't

eat it I will have to pay for it anyway.  You wouldn't

want me to be extravagant, would you?''



``No,'' said the Girl, ``and besides, since you mention

it, I believe I am hungry.''



``Good!'' cried the Harvester.  ``I hoped so!  Ruth,

you wouldn't allow me to hold your hand just until we

reach the cafe'?  It might save me from bursting with

joy.''



``Yes,'' she said.  ``But I must take off my lovely

gloves first.  I want to keep them forever.''



``I'd hate the glove being removed dreadfully,'' said

the Harvester, his eyes dancing and snapping.



``I'm sorry I am so thin and shaky,'' said the Girl. 

``I will be steady and plump soon, won't I?''



``On your life you will,'' said the Harvester, taking

the hand gently.



Now there are a number of things a man deeply in

love can think of to do with a woman's white hand. 

He can stroke it, press it tenderly, and lay it against his

lips and his heart.  The Harvester lacked experience

in these arts, and yet by some wonderful instinct all

of these things occurred to him.  There was real colour

in the Girl's cheeks by the time he helped her into the

cafe'.  They were guided to a small room, cool and restful,

close a window, beside which grew a tree covered with

talking leaves.  A waiting attendant, who seemed perfectly

adept, brought in steaming bouillon, fragrant tea,

broiled chicken, properly cooked vegetables, a wonderful

salad, and then delicious ices and cold fruit.  The happy

Harvester leaned back and watched the Girl daintily

manage almost as much food as he wanted to see her

eat.



When they had finished, ``Now we are going home,''

he said.  ``Will you try to like it, Ruth?''



``Indeed I will,'' she promised.  ``As soon as I grow

accustomed to the dreadful stillness, and learn what

things will not bite me, I'll be better.''



``I'll have to ask you to wait a minute,'' he said. 

``One thing I forgot.  I must hire a man to take Betsy

home.''



``Aren't you going to drive her yourself?''



``No ma'am!  We are going in a carriage or a motor,''

said the Harvester.



``Indeed we are not!'' contradicted the Girl.  ``You

have had this all your way so far.  I am going home

behind Betsy, with Belshazzar at my knee.''



``But your dress!  People will think I am crazy to

put a lovely woman like you in a spring wagon.''



``Let them!'' said the Girl placidly.  ``Why should

we bother about other people?  I am going with Betsy

and Belshazzar.''



The Harvester had been thinking that he adored her,

that it was impossible to love her more, but every

minute was proving to him that he was capable of feeling

so profound it startled him.  To carry the Girl, his

bride, through the valley and up the hill in the little

spring wagon drawn by Betsy--that would have been

his ideal way.  But he had supposed that she would be

afraid of soiling her dress, and embarrassed to ride in

such a conveyance.  Instead it was her choice.  Yes,

he could love her more.  Hourly she was proving that.



``Come this way a few steps,'' he said.  ``Betsy is

here.''



The Girl laid her face against the nose of the faithful

old animal, and stroked her head and neck.  Then she

held her skirts and the Harvester helped her into the

wagon.  She took the seat, and the dog went wild with

joy.



``Come on, Bel,'' she softly commanded.



The dog hesitated, and looked at the Harvester for

permission.



``You may come here and put your head on my knee,''

said the Girl.



``Belshazzar, you lucky dog, you are privileged to sit

there and lay your head on the lady's lap,'' said the

Harvester, and the dog quivered with joy.



Then the man picked up the lines, gave a backward

glance to the bed of the wagon, high piled with large

bundles, and turned Betsy toward Medicine Woods. 

Through the crowded streets and toward the country

they drove, when a big red car passed, a man called

to them, then reversed and slowly began backing beside

the wagon.  The Harvester stopped.



``That is my best friend, Doctor Carey, of the hospital,

Ruth,'' he said hastily.  ``May I tell him, and will you

shake hands with him?''



``Certainly!'' said the Girl.



``Is it really you, David?'' the doctor peered with

gleaming eyes from under the car top.



``Really!'' cried the Harvester, as man greets man with

a full heart when he is sure of sympathy.  ``Come, give

us your best send-off, Doc!  We were married an hour

ago.  We are headed for Medicine Woods.  Doctor

Carey, this is Mrs. Langston.''



``Mighty glad to know you!'' cried the doctor, reaching

a happy hand.



The Girl met it cordially, while she smiled on

him.



``How did this happen?'' demanded the doctor.  ``Why

didn't you let us know?  This is hardly fair of you,

David.  You might have let me and the Missus share

with you.''



``That is to be explained,'' said the Harvester.  ``It

was decided on very suddenly, and rather sadly, on

account of the death of Mrs. Jameson.  I forced Ruth

to marry me and come with me.  I grow rather frightened

when I think of it, but it was the only way I knew.  She

absolutely refused my other plans.  You see before you

a wild man carrying away a woman to his cave.''



``Don't believe him, Doctor!'' laughed the Girl.  ``If

you know him, you will understand that to offer all he

had was like him, when he saw my necessity.  You will

come to see us soon?''



``I'll come right now,'' said the doctor.  ``I'll bring

my wife and arrive by the time you do.''



``Oh no you won't!'' said the Harvester.  ``Do you

observe the bed of this wagon?  This happened all

`unbeknownst' to us.  We have to set up housekeeping

after we reach home.  We will notify you when we are

ready for visitors.  Just you subside and wait until you

are sent for.''



``Why David!'' cried the astonished Girl.



``That's the law!'' said the Harvester tersely.  ``Good-

bye, Doc; we'll be ready for you in a day or two.''



He leaned down and held out his hand.  The grip

that caught it said all any words could convey; and

then Betsy started up the hill.
