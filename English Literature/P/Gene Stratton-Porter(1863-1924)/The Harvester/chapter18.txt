THE BETTER MAN



In the middle of the afternoon the Harvester

arose and went into the lake, ate a hearty

dinner, and then took up his watch again.  For

two days and nights he kept his place, until he had the

Girl out of danger, and where careful nursing was all that

was required to insure life and health.  As he sat beside

her the last day, his physical endurance strained to the

breaking point, she laid her hand over his, and looked

long and steadily into his eyes.



``There are so many things I want to know,'' she said.



The Harvester's firm fingers closed over hers.  ``Ruth,

have you ever been sorry that you trusted me?''



``Never!'' said the Girl instantly.



``Then suppose you keep it up,'' said he.  ``Whatever

it is that you want to know, don't use an iota of

strength to talk or to think about it now.  Just say to

yourself, he loves me well enough to do what is right, and

I know that he will.  All you have to do is to be patient

until you grow stronger than you ever have been in your

life, and then you shall have exactly what you want,

Ruth.  Sleep like a baby for a week or two.  Then,

slowly and gradually, we will build up such a constitution

for you that you shall ride, drive, row, swim, dance,

play, and have all that your girlhood has missed in fun

and frolic, and all that your womanhood craves in love

and companionship.  Happiness has come at last, Ruth. 

Take it from me.  Everything you crave is yours.  The

love you want, the home, and the life.  As soon

as you are strong enough, you shall know all about

it.  Your business is to drink stimulants and sleep

now, dear.''



``So tired of this bed!''



``It won't be long until you can lie on the couch and

the veranda swing again.''



``Glory!'' said the Girl.  ``David, I must have been

full of fever for a long time.  I can't remember everything.''



``Don't try, I tell you.  Life is coming out right for

you; that's all you need know now.''



``And for you, David?''



``Whenever things are right for you, they are for me,

Ruth.''



``Don't you ever think of yourself?''



``Not when I am close you.''



``Ah!  Then I shall have to grow strong very soon and

think of you.''



The Harvester's smile was pathetic.  He was

unspeakably tired again.



``Never mind me!'' he said.  ``Only get well.''



``David, was there a little horse?''



``There certainly was and is,'' said the Harvester. 

 

``You had not named him yet, but in a few days I can

lead him to the window.''



``Was there something said about a boat?''



``Two of them.''



``Two?''



``Yes.  A row boat for you, and a launch that will

take you all over the lake with only the exertion of steering

on your part.''



``David, I want my pendant and ring.  I am so tired

of lying here, I want to play with them.''



``Where do you keep them, Ruth?''



``In the willow teapot.  I thought no one would look

there.''



The Harvester laughed and brought the little boxes. 

He had to open them, but the Girl put on the ring and

asked him if he would not help her with the pendant.  He

slipped the thread around her neck and clasped it.  With

a sigh of satisfaction she took the ornament in one hand

and closed her eyes.  He thought she was falling asleep,

but presently she looked at him.



``You won't allow them to take it from me?''



``Indeed no!  There is no reason on earth why you

should not have that thread around your neck if you want

it.''



``I am going to sleep now.  I want two things.  May

I have them?''



``You may,'' said the Harvester promptly, ``provided

they are not to eat.''



``No,'' said the Girl.  ``I've suffered and made others

trouble.  I won't bother you by asking for anything more

than is brought me.  This is different.  You are completely

worn out.  Your face frightens me, David, and

white hairs that were not there a few days ago have come

along your temples.  I can see them.''



``You gave me a mighty serious scare, Ruth.''



``I know,'' said the Girl.  ``Forgive me.  I didn't

mean to.  I want you to leave me to Doctor Harmon

and the nurse and go sleep a week.  Then I will be ready

for the swing, and to hear some more about the trees and

birds.''



``I can keep it up if you really need me, but if you don't

I am sleepy.  So, if you feel safe, I think I will go.''



``Oh I am safe enough,'' said the Girl.  ``It isn't that. 

I'm so lonely.  I've made up my mind not to grieve for

mother, but I miss her so now.  I feel so friendless.''



``But, honey,'' said the Harvester, ``you mustn't do

that!  Don't you see how all of us love you?  Here is

Granny shutting up her house and living here, just to

be with you.  The nurse will do anything you say.  Here

is the man you know best, and think so much of, staying

in the cabin, and so happy to give you all his time, and

anything else you will have, dear.  And the Careys

come every day, and will do their best to comfort you,

and always I am here for you to fall back on.''



``Yes, I'm falling right now,'' said the Girl.  ``I

almost wish I had the fever again.  No one has touched

me for days.  I feel as if every one was afraid of me.''



The Harvester was puzzled.



``Well, Ruth, I'm doing the best I know,'' he said. 

``What is it you want?''



``Nothing!'' answered the Girl with slightly dejected

inflection.  ``Say good-bye to me, and go sleep your week. 

I'll be very good, and then you shall take me a drive up

the hill when you awaken.  Won't that be fine?''



``Say good-bye to me!''  She felt a ``little lonely!'' 

They all acted as if they were ``afraid'' of her.  The

Harvester indulged in a flashing mental review and

arrived at a decision.  He knelt beside the bed, took both

slender, cool hands and covered them with kisses.  Then

he slid a hand under the pillow and raised the tired head.



``If I am to say good-bye, I have to do it in my own

way, Ruth,'' he said.



Thereupon he began at the tumbled mass of hair and

kissed from her forehead to her lips, kisses warm and

tender.



``Now you go to sleep, and grow strong enough by the

time I come back to tell me whom you love,'' he said,

and went from the room without waiting for any reply.



With short intervals for food and dips in the lake the

Harvester very nearly slept the week.  When he finally

felt himself again, he bathed, shaved, dressed freshly,

and went to see the Girl.  He had to touch her to be

sure she was real.  She was extremely weak and tremulous,

but her face and hands were fuller, her colour

was good, she was ravenously hungry.  Doctor Harmon

said she was a little tryant, and the nurse that she was

plain cross.  The first thing the Harvester noticed was

that the dull blue look in the depth of the dark eyes was

gone.  They were clear, dusky wells, with shining

lights at the bottom.



``Well I never would have believed it!'' he cried. 

``Doctor Harmon, you are a great physician!  You have

made her all over new, and in a few more days she will

be on the veranda.  This is great!''



``Do I appear so much better to you, Harvester?''

asked the Girl.



``Has no one thought to show you,'' cried the

Harvester.  ``Here, let me!'



He stepped to her dressing table, picked up a mirror,

and held it before her so that she could see herself.



``Seems to me I am dreadfully white and thin yet!''



``If you had seen what I saw ten days ago, my Girl,

you would think you appear like a pink, rosy angel now,

or a wonderful dream.''



``Truly, do I in the least resemble a dream, David?''



``You are a dream.  The loveliest one a man ever had. 

With three months of right care and exercise you'll

be the beautiful woman nature intended.  I'm so proud

of you.  You are being so brave!  Just lie there in

patience a few more days, and out you come again to life;

and life that will thrill your being with joy.''



``All right,'' said the Girl, ``I will.  David are you

attending to your herbs?''



``Not for a few weeks.''



``You are very much behind?''



``No.  Nothing important.  I don't make enough

to count on what is ready now.  I can soon gather

jimson leaves and seed to fill orders, the hemlock is

about right to take the fruit, the mustard is yet in pod,

and the saffron and wormseed can be attended later. 

I can catch up in two days.''



``What about----about the big bed on the hill?''



The Harvester experienced an inward thrill of delight. 

She was so impressed with the value of the ginseng she

would not mention it, even before the man she loved----

no more than that----``adored''----``worshipped!'' 

He smiled at her in understanding.



``I'll have to take a peep at that and report,'' he said.



``Are you rested now?''



``Indeed yes!''



``You are dreadfully thin.''



``I always am.  I'll pick up a little when I get back to

work.''



``David, I want you to go to work now.''



``Can you spare me?''



``Haven't we done well these last few days?''



``I can't tell you how well.''



``Then please go gather everything you need to fill

orders except the big bed, and by that time maybe you

could take another week off, and I could go to the hill

top and on the lake.  I'm so anxious to put my feet on

the earth.  They feel so dead.''



``Are your feet well rubbed to draw down the circulation?''



``They are rubbed shiny and almost skinned, David. 

No one ever had better care, of that I am sure.  Go

gather what you should have.''



``All right,'' said the Harvester.



He arose and as he started to leave the room he took

one last look at the Girl to see if he could detect anything

he could suggest for her comfort, and read a message

in her eyes.  Instantly there was an answering flash

in his.



``I'll be back in a minute,'' he said.  ``I just noticed

discorea villosa has the finest rattle boxes formed.  I've

been waiting to show you.  And the hop tree has its

castanets all green and gold.  In a few more weeks it

will begin to play for you.  I'll bring you some.''



Soon he returned with the queer seed formations, and

as he bent above her, with his back to Doctor Harmon, he

whispered, ``What is it?''



Her lips barely formed the one word, ``Hurry!''



The Harvester straightened.



``All comfortable, Ruth?'' he asked casually.



``Yes.''



``You understand, of course, that there is not the

slightest necessity for my going to work if you really

want me for anything, even if it's nothing more than to

have me within calling distance, in case you SHOULD

want something.  The whole lot I can gather now won't

amount to twenty dollars.  It's merely a matter of

pride with me to have what is called for.  I'd much rather

remain, if you can use me in any way at all.''



``Twenty dollars is considerable, when expenses are

as heavy as now.  And it's worth more than any money

to you not to fail when orders come.  I have learned that,

and David, I don't want you to either.  You must fill

all demands as usual.  I wouldn't forgive myself this

winter if you should be forced to send orders only partly

filled because I fell ill and hindered you.  Please go and

gather all you possibly will need of everything you take

at this season, only remember!''



``There is no danger of my forgetting.  If you are

going to send me away to work, you will allow me to kiss

your hand before I go, fair lady?''



He did it fervently.



``One word with you, Harmon,'' he said as he left the

room.



Doctor Harmon arose and followed him to the gold

garden, and together they stood beside the molten hedge

of sunflowers, coneflowers, elecampane, and jewel flower.



``I merely want to mention that this is your inning,''

said the Harvester.  ``Find out if you are essential to the

Girl's happiness as soon as you can, and the day she tells

me so, I will file her petition and take a trip to the city

to study some little chemical quirks that bother me. 

That's all.''



The Harvester went to the dry-house for bags and

clipping shears, and the doctor returned to the sunshine room.



``Ruth,'' he said, ``do you know that the Harvester

is the squarest man I ever met?''



``Is he?'' asked the Girl.



``He is!  He certainly is!''



``You must remember that I have little acquaintance

with men,'' said she.  ``You are the first one I ever knew,

and the only one except him.''



``Well I try to be square,'' said Doctor Harmon,

``but that is where Langston has me beaten a mile.  I

have to try.  He doesn't.  He was born that way.''



The Girl began to laugh.



``His environment is so different,'' she said.  ``Perhaps

if he were in a big city, he would have to try

also.''



``Won't do!'' said the doctor.  ``He chose his location. 

So did I.  He is a stronger physical man than I ever was

or ever will be.  The struggle that bound him to the

woods and to research, that made him the master of

forces that give back life, when a man like Carey says

it is the end, proves him a master.  The tumult in his

soul must have been like a cyclone in his forest, when he

turned his back on the world and stuck to the woods. 

Carey told me about it.  Some day you must hear.  It's

a story a woman ought to know in order to arrive at

proper values.  You never will understand the man until

you know that he is clean where most of us are blackened

with ugly sins we have no right on God's footstool

to commit and not so much reason as he.  Every man

should be as he is, but very few are.  Carey says Langston's

mother was a wonderful element in the formation

of his character; but all mothers are anxious, and none

of them can build with no foundation and no soul timber. 

She had material for a man to her hand, or she couldn't

have made one.''



``I see what you mean.''



``So far as any inexperienced girl ever sees,'' said the

doctor.  ``Some day if you live to fifty you will know,

but you can't comprehend it now.''



``If you think I lived all my life in Chicago's poverty

spots and don't know unbridled human nature!''



``I found you and your mother unusually innocent

women.  You may understand some things.  I hope

you do.  It will help you to decide who is the real man

among the men who come into your life.  There are

some men, Ruth, who are fit to mate with a woman,

and to perpetuate themselves and their mental and

moral forces in children, who will be like them, and there

are others who are not.  It is these `others' who are

responsible for the sin of the world, the sickness and

suffering.  Any time you are sure you have a chance at a

moral man, square and honest, in control of his brain and

body, if you are a wise woman, Ruth, stick to him as the

limpet to the rock.''



``You mean stick to the Harvester?''



``If you are a wise woman!''



``When was a woman ever wise?''



``A few have been.  They are the only care-free,

really happy ones of the world, the only wives without

a big, poison, blue-bottle fly in their ointment.''



``I detest flies!'' said the Girl.



``So do I,'' said the doctor.  ``For this reason I say

to you choose the ointment that never had one in it. 

Take the man who is `master of his fate, captain of his

soul.'  Stick to the Harvester!  He is infinitely the

better man!''



``Well have you seen anything to indicate that I

wasn't sticking?'' asked the Girl.



``No.  And for your sake I hope I never will.''



She laughed softly.



``You do love him, Ruth?''



``As I did my mother, yes.  There is not a trace in

my heart of the thing he calls love.''



``You have been stunted, warped, and the fountains

of life never have opened.  It will come with right

conditions of living.''



``Do you think so?''



``I know so.  At least there is no one else you love,

Ruth?''



``No one except you.''



``And do you feel about me just as you do him?''



``No!  It is different.  What I owe him is for myself. 

What I owe you is for my mother.  You saw!  You

know!  You understand what you did for her, and what

it meant to me.  The Harvester must be the finest man

on earth, but when I try to think of either God or Heaven,

your face intervenes.''



``That's all right, Ruth, I'm so glad you told me,''

said Doctor Harmon.  ``I can make it all perfectly clear

to you.  You just go on and worship me all you please. 

It's bound to make a cleaner, better man of me. 

What you feel for me will hold me to a higher moral

level all my life than I ever have known before; but never

forget that you are not going to live in Heaven.  You

will be here at least sixty years yet, so when you come

to think of selecting a partner for the relations of the

world, you stick to the finest man on earth; see?''



``I do!'' said the Girl.  ``I saw you kiss Molly a

week ago.  She is lovely, and I hope you will be

perfectly happy.  It won't interfere with my worshipping

you; not the least in the world.  Go ahead and be

joyful!''



The doctor sprang to his feet in crimson confusion. 

The Girl lay and laughed at him.



``Don't!'' she cried.  ``It's all right!  It takes a weight

off my soul as heavy as a mountain.  I do adore you, as

I said.  But every hour since I left Chicago a big, black

cloud has hung over me.  I didn't feel free.  I didn't

feel absolved.  I felt that my obligations to you were so

heavy that when I had settled the last of the money debt

I was in honour bound----''



``Don't, Ruth!  Forget those dreadful times, as I told

you then!  Think only of a happy future!''



``Let me finish,'' said the Girl.  ``Let me get this out

of my system with the other poison.  From the day I

came here, I've whispered in my heart, `I am not free!' 

But if you love another woman!  If you are going to take

her to your heart and to your lips, why that is my

release.  Oh Man, speak the words!  Tell me I am free

indeed!''



``Ruth, be quiet, for mercy sake!  You'll raise a

temperature, and the Harvester will pitch me into the lake. 

You are free, child, of course!  You always have been. 

I understood the awful pressure that was on you with

the very first glimpse I had of your mother.  Who was

she, Ruth?''



``She never would tell me.''



``She thought you would appeal to her people?''



``She knew I would!  I couldn't have helped it.''



``Would you like to know?''



``I never want to.  It is too late.  I infinitely prefer

to remain in ignorance.  Talk of something else.''



``Let me read a wonderful book I found on the

Harvester's shelves.''



``Anything there will contain wonders, because he only

buys what appeals to him, and it takes a great book to

do that.  I am going to learn.  He will teach me, and

when I come within comprehending distance of him, then

we are going on together.''



``What an attractive place this is!''



``Isn't it?  I only have seen enough to understand the

plan.  I scarcely can wait to set my feet on earth and go

into detail.  Granny Moreland says that when spring

comes over the hill, and brings up the flowers in the big

woods, she'd rather walk through them than to read

Revelation.  She says it gives her an idea of Heaven

she can come closer realizing and it seems more stable. 

You know she worries about the foundations.  She can't

understand what supports Heaven.  But up there in

Medicine Woods the old dear gets so close her God

that some day she is going to realize that her idea

of Heaven there is quite as near right as marble

streets and gold pillars and vastly more probable.  The

day I reach that hill top again, Heaven begins for me. 

Do you know the wonderful thing the Harvester did up

there?''



``Under the oak?''



``Yes.''



``Carey told me.  It was marvellous.''



``Not such a marvel as another the doctor couldn't have

known.  The Harvester made passing out so natural,

so easy, so a part of elemental forces, that I almost have

forgotten her tortured body.  When I think of her now,

it is to wonder if next summer I can distinguish her

whisper among the leaves.  Before you go, I'll take you

up there and tell you what he says, and show you what

he means, and you will feel it also.''



``What if I shouldn't go?''



``What do you mean?''



``Doctor Carey has offered me a splendid position in

his hospital.  There would be work all day, instead of

waiting all day in the hope of working an hour.  There

would be a living in it for two from the word go.  There

would be better air, longer life, more to be got out of it,

and if I can make good, Carey's work to take up as he

grows old.''



``Take it!  Take it quickly!'' cried the Girl.  ``Don't

wait a minute!  You might wear out your heart in

Chicago for twenty years or forever, and not have an

opportunity to do one half so much good.  Take it at

once!''



``I was waiting to learn what you and Langston would

say.''



``He will say take it.''



``Then I will be too happy for words.  Ruth, you have

not only paid the debt, but you have brought me the

greatest joy a man ever had.  And there is no need to

wait the ages I thought I must.  He can tell in a year if

I can do the work, and I know I can now; so it's all

settled, if Langston agrees.''



``He will,'' said the Girl.  ``Let me tell him!''



``I wish you would,'' said the doctor.  ``I don't know

just how to go at it.''



Then for two days the Harvester and Belshazzar

gathered herbs and spread them on the drying trays. 

On the afternoon of the third, close three, the doctor

came to the door.



``Langston,'' he said, ``we have a call for you.  We

can't keep Ruth quiet much longer.  She is tired.  We

want to change her bed completely.  She won't allow

either of us to lift her.  She says we hurt her.  Will

you come and try it?''



``You'll have to give me time to dip and rub off and

get into clean clothing,'' he said.  ``I've been keeping

away, because I was working on time, and I smell to

strangulation of stramonium and saffron.''



``Can't give you ten seconds,'' said the doctor.  ``Our

temper is getting brittle.  We are cross as the proverbial

fever patient.  If you don't come at once we will imagine

you don't want to, and refuse to be moved at all.''



``Coming!'' cried the Harvester, as he plunged his

hands in the wash bowl and soused his face.  A second

later he appeared on the porch.



``Ruth,'' he said, ``I am steeped in the odours of

the dry-house.  Can't you wait until I bathe and

dress?''



``No, I can't,'' said a fretful voice.  ``I can't endure

this bed another minute.''



``Then let Doctor Harmon lift you.  He is so fresh and

clean.''



The Harvester glanced enviously at the shaven face

and white trousers and shirt of the doctor.



``I just hate fresh, clean men.  I want to smell herbs. 

I want to put my feet in the dirt and my hands in the

water.''



The Harvester came at a rush.  He brought a big easy

chair from the living-room, straightened the cover, and

bent above the Girl.  He picked her up lightly, gently,

and easing her to his body settled in the chair.  She laid her

face on his shoulder, and heaved a deep sigh of content.



``Be careful with my back, Man,'' she said.  ``I think

my spine is almost worn through.''



``Poor girl,'' said the Harvester.  ``That bed should

be softer.''



``It should not!''contradicted the Girl.  ``It should be

much harder.  I'm tired of soft beds.  I want to lie

on the earth, with my head on a root; and I wish it would

rain dirt on me.  I am bathed threadbare.  I want to

be all streaky.''



``I understand,'' said the Harvester.  ``Harmon, bring

me a pad and pencil a minute, I must write an order

for some things I want.  Will you call up town and

have them sent out immediately?''



On the pad he wrote:  ``Telephone Carey to get the

highest grade curled-hair mattress, a new pad, and pillow,

and bring them flying in the car.  Call Granny

and the girl and empty the room.  Clean, air, and fumigate

it thoroughly.  Arrange the furniture differently,

and help me into the living-room with Ruth.''  He

handed the pad to the doctor.



``Please attend to that,'' he said, and to the Girl: 

``Now we go on a journey.  Doc, you and Molly take

the corners of the rug we are on and slide us into the other

room until you get this aired and freshened.''



In the living-room the Girl took one long look at the

surroundings and suddenly relaxed.  She cuddled against

the Harvester and lifting a tremulous white hand, drew

it across his unshaven cheek.



``Feels so good,'' she said.  ``I'm sick and tired of

immaculate men.''



The Harvester laughed, tucked her feet in the cover and

held her tenderly.  The Girl lay with her cheek against

the rough khaki, palpitant with the excitement of being

moved.



``Isn't it great?'' she panted.



He caught the hand that had touched his cheek in a

tender grip, and laughed a deep rumble of exultation

that came from the depths of his heart.



``There's no name for it, honey,'' he said.  ``But

don't try to talk until you have a long rest.  Changing

positions after you have lain so long may be making

unusual work for your heart.  Am I hurting your back?''



``No,'' said the Girl.  ``This is the first time I have been

comfortable in ages.  Am I tiring you?''



``Yes,'' laughed the Harvester.  ``You are almost as

heavy as a large sack of leaves, but not quite equal to a

bridge pillar or a log.  Be sure to think of that, and worry

considerably.  You are in danger of straining my muscles

to the last degree, my heart included.''



``Where is your heart?'' whispered the Girl.



``Right under your cheek,'' answered the Harvester. 

``But for Heaven's sake, don't intimate that you are

taking any interest in it, or it will go to pounding until

your head will bounce.  It's one member of my body that

I can't control where you are concerned.''



``I thought you didn't like me any more.''



``Careful!'' warned the Harvester.  ``You are yet

too close Heaven to fib like that, Ruth.  What have I

done to indicate that I don't love you more than ever?''



``Stayed away nearly every minute for three awful

days, and wouldn't come without being dragged; and

now you're wishing they would hurry and fix that bed,

so you can put me down and go back to your rank old

herbs again.''



``Well of all the black prevarications!  I went when

you sent me, and came when you called.  I'd willingly

give up my hope of what Granny calls `salvation' to

hold you as I am for an hour, and you know it.''



``It's going to be much longer than that,'' said the

Girl nestling to him.  ``I asked for you because you

never hurt me, and they always do.  I knew you were

so strong that my weight now wouldn't be a load for one

of your hands, and I am not going back to that bed

until I am so tired that I will be glad to lie down.''



For a long time she was so silent the Harvester thought

her going to sleep; and having learned that for him joy

was probably transient, he deliberately got all he could. 

He closely held the hand she had not withdrawn, and

often lifted it to his lips.  Sometimes he stroked the

heavy braid, gently ran his hands across the tired shoulders,

or eased her into a different position.  There was

not a doubt in his mind of one thing.  He was having a

royal, good time, and he was thankful for the work he

had set his assistants that kept them out of the room. 

They seemed in no hurry, and from scuffling, laughing,

and a steady stream of talk, they were entertained at

least.  At last the Girl roused.



``There is something I want to ask you,'' she said. 

``I promised Doctor Harmon I would.''



Instantly the heart of the Harvester gave a leap

that jarred the head resting on it.



``You don't like him?'' questioned the Girl.



``I do!'' declared the Harvester.  ``I like him immensely.  

There is not a fine, manly good-looking feature

about him that I have missed.  I don't fail to do

him justice on every point.''



``I'm so glad!  Then you will want him to remain.''



``Here?'' asked the Harvester with a light, hot breath.



``In Onabasha!  Doctor Carey has offered him the

place of chief assistant at the hospital.  There is a good

salary and the chance of taking up the doctor's work as

he grows older.  It means plenty to do at once, healthful

atmosphere, congenial society----everything to a young

man.  He only had a call once in a while in Chicago,

often among people who received more than they paid,

like me, and he was very lonely.  I think it would be

great for him.''



``And for you, Ruth?''



``It doesn't make the least difference to me; but for

his sake, because I think so much of him, I would like

to see him have the place.''



``You still think so much of him, Ruth?''



``More, if possible,'' said the Girl.  ``Added to all I

owed him before, he has come here and worked for days

to save me, and it wasn't his fault that it took a bigger

man.  Nothing alters the fact that he did all he could,

most graciously and gladly.''



``What do you mean, Ruth?'' stammered the Harvester.



``Oh they have worn themselves out!'' cried the Girl

impatiently.  ``First, Granny Moreland told me every

least little detail of how I went out, and you resurrected

me.  I knew what she said was true, because she worked

with you.  Then Doctor Carey told me, and Mrs. Carey,

and Doctor Harmon, and Molly, and even Granny's

little assistant has left the kitchen to tell me that I

owe my life to you, and all of them might as well have

saved breath.  I knew all the time that if ever I came

out of this, and had a chance to be like other women,

it would be your work, and I'm glad it is.  I'd hate

to be under obligations to some people I know; but I

feel honoured to be indebted to you.''



``I'm mighty sorry they worried you.  I had no idea----''



``They didn't `worry,' me!  I am just telling you that

I knew it all the time; that's all!''



``Forget that!'' said the Harvester.  ``Come back to

our subject.  What was it you wanted, dear?''



``To know if you have any objections to Doctor Harmon

remaining in Onabasha?''



``Certainly not!  It will be a fine thing for him.''



``Will it make any difference to you in any way?''



``Ruth, that's probing too deep,'' said the Harvester.



``I don't see why!''



``I'm glad of it!''



``Why?''



``I'd least rather show my littleness to you than to

any one else on earth.''



``Then you have some feeling about it?''



``Perhaps a trifle.  I'll get over it.  Give me a little

time to adjust myself.  Doctor Harmon shall have the

place, of course.  Don't worry about that!''



``He will be so happy!''



``And you, Ruth?''



``I'll be happy too!''



``Then it's all right,'' said the Harvester.



He laid down her hand, drew the cover over it, and

slightly shifted her position to rest her.  The door

opened, and Doctor Harmon announced that the room

was ready.  It was shining and fresh.  The bed was

now turned with its head to the north, so that from it one

could see the big trees in Medicine Woods, the sweep

of the hillside, the sparkle of mallow-bordered Singing

Water, the driveway and the gold flower garden.  Everything

was so changed that the room had quite a different

appearance.  The instant he laid her on it the Girl said,

``This bed is not mine.''



``Yes it is,'' said the Harvester.  ``You see, we were

a little excited sometimes, and we spilled a few quarts of

perfectly good medicine on your mattress.  It was hopelessly

smelly and ruined; so I am going to cremate it

and this is your splinter new one and a fresh pad and

pillow.  Now you try them and see if they are not much

harder and more comfortable.''



``This is just perfect!'' she sighed, as she sank into the bed.



The Harvester bent over her to straighten the cover,

when suddenly she reached both arms around his neck,

and gripped him with all her strength.



``Thank you!'' she said.



``May I hold you to-morrow?'' whispered the Harvester,

emboldened by this.



``Please do,'' said the Girl.



The Harvester, with dog to heel, went to the oak to

think.



``Belshazzar, kommen Sie!'' said the man, dropping

on the seat and holding out his hand.  The dog laid his

muzzle in the firm grip.



``Bel,'' said the Harvester, ``I am all at sea.  One day

I think maybe I have a little chance, the next----none at

all.  I had an hour of solid comfort to-day, now I'm in the

sweat box again.  It's a little selfish streak in me, Bel,

that hates to see Harmon go into the hospital and take

my place with the Careys.  They are my best and only

friends.  He is young, social, handsome, and will be

ever present.  In three months he will become so popular

that I might as well be off the earth.  I wish I didn't

think it, but I'm so small that I do.  And then there is

my Dream Girl, Bel.  The girl you found for me, old

fellow.  There never was another like her, and she has

my heart for all time.  And he has hers.  That hospital

plan is the best thing in the world for her.  It will keep

her where Carey can have an eye on her, where the air

is better, where she can have company without the city

crush, where she is close the country, and a good living

is assured.  Bel, it's the nicest arrangement you ever

saw for every one we know, except us.''



The Harvester laughed shortly.  ``Bel,'' he said, ``tell

me!  If a man lived a hundred years, could he have the

heartache all the way?  Seems like I've had it almost

that long now.  In fact, I've had it such ages I'd be

lonesome without it.  This is some more of my very

own medicine, so I shouldn't make a wry face over

taking it.  I knew what would happen when I sent for

him, and I didn't hesitate.  I must not now.



``Only I got to stop one thing, Bel.  I told him I

would play square, and I have.  But here it ends. 

After this, I must step back and be big brother.  Lots

of fun in this brother business, Bel.  But maybe I am

cut out for it.  Anyway it's written!  But if it is, how

did she come to allow me such privileges as I took to-

day?  That wasn't professional by any means.  It

was just the stiffest love-making I knew how to do, Bel,

and she didn't object by the quiver of an eyelash.  God

knows I was watching closely enough for any sign that I

was distasteful.  And I might have been well enough. 

Rough, herb-stained old clothes, unshaven, everything

to offend a dainty girl.  She said I might hold her again

to-morrow.  And, Bel, what the nation did she hug me

like that for, if she's going to marry him?  Boy, I see

my way clear to an hour more.  While I'm at it, just to

surprise myself, I believe I'll take it like other men.  I

think I'll go on a little bender, and make what probably

will be the last day a plumb good one.  Something

worth remembering is better than nothing at all, Bel! 

He hasn't told me that he has won.  She didn't SAY

she was going to marry him, and she did say he hurt

her, and she wanted me.  Bel, how about the grimness

of it, if she should marry him and then discover that

he hurts her, and she wants me.  Lord God Almighty,

if you have any mercy at all, never put me up against

that,'' prayed the Harvester, ``for my heart is water

where she is concerned.''



The Harvester arose, and going to the lake, he cut an

arm load of big, pink mallows, covered each mound with

fresh flowers, whistled to the dog, and went to his work. 

Many things had accumulated, and he cleaned the barn,

carried herbs from the dry-house to the store-room,

and put everything into shape.  Close noon the next

day he went to Onabasha, and was gone three hours. 

He came back barbered in the latest style, and carrying

a big bundle.  When the hour for arranging the bed

came, he was yet in his room, but he sent word he

would be there in a second.



As he crossed the living-room he pulled a chair to the

veranda and placed a footstool before it.  Then he

stepped into the sunshine room.  A quizzical expression

crossed the face of Doctor Harmon as he closed the book

he was reading aloud to the Girl and arose.  Wholly

unembarrassed the Harvester smiled.



``Have I got this rigging anywhere near right?'' he

inquired.



``David, what have you done?'' gasped the amazed

Girl.



``I didn't feel anywhere near up to the `mark of my

high calling' yesterday,'' quoted the Harvester.  ``I

don't know how I appear, but I'm clean as shaving,

soap and hot water will make me, and my clothing will

not smell offensively.  Now come out of that bed for a

happy hour.  Where is that big coverlet?  You are going

on the veranda to-day.''



``You look just like every one else,'' complained

Doctor Harmon.



``You look perfectly lovely,'' declared the Girl.



``The swale sends you this invitation to come and see

star-shine at the foot of mullein hill,'' said the Harvester,

offering a bouquet.  It was a loose bunch of long-

stemmed, delicate flowers, each an inch across, and

having five pearl-white petals lightly striped with pale

green.  Five long gold anthers arose, and at their base

gold stamens and a green pistil.  The leaves were heart-

shaped and frosty, whitish-green, resembling felt.  The

Harvester bent to offer them.



``Have some Grass of Parnassus, my dear,'' he said.



The Girl waved them away.  ``Go stand over there by

the door and slowly turn around.  I want to see you.''



The Harvester obeyed.  He was freshly and carefully

shaven.  His hair was closely cropped at the base of

the head, long, heavy, and slightly waving on top.  He

wore a white silk shirt, with a rolling collar and tie, white

trousers, belt, hose, and shoes, and his hands were

manicured with care.



``Have I made a mess of it, or do I appear anything

like other men?'' he asked, eagerly.



The Girl lifted her eyes to Doctor Harmon and smiled.



``Do you observe anything messy?'' she inquired.



``You needn't fish for compliments quite so obviously,''

he answered.  ``I'll pay them without being asked. 

I do not.  He is quite correct, and infinitely better

looking than the average.  Distinguished is a proper

word for the gentleman in my opinion.  But why, in

Heaven's name, have we never had the pleasure of seeing

you thus before?''



``Look here, Doc,'' said the Harvester, ``do you mean

that you enjoy looking at me merely because I am dressed

this way?''



``I do indeed,'' said the doctor.  ``It is good to see

you with the garb of work laid aside, and the stamp of

cleanliness and ease upon you.''



``By gum, that is rubbing it in a little too rough!''

cried the Harvester.  ``I bathe oftener than you do.  My

clothing is always clean when I start out.  Of course,

in my work I come hourly in contact with muck, water,

and herb juices.''



``It's understood that is unavoidable,'' said Doctor

Harmon.



``And if cleanliness is made an issue, I'd rather roll

in any of it than put my finger tips into the daily work

of a surgeon,'' added the Harvester, and the Girl

giggled.



``That's enough Medicine Man!'' she said.  ``You

did not make a `mess' of it, or anything else you ever

attempted.  As for appearing like other men, thank

Heaven, you do not.  You look just a whole world

bigger and better and finer.  Come, carry me out

quickly.  I am wild to go.  Please put my lovely flowers

in water, Molly, only give me a few to hold.''



The Harvester arranged the pink coverlet, picked up

the Girl, and carried her to the living-room.



``We will rest here a little,'' he said, ``and then, if you

feel equal to it, we will try the veranda.  Are you easy

now?''



She nestled her face against the soft shirt and smiled

at him.  She lifted her hand, laid it on his smooth cheek

and then the crisp hair.



``Oh Man!'' she cried.  ``Thank God you didn't give

me up, too!  I want life!  I want LIFE!''



The Harvester tightened his grip just a trifle.  ``Then

I thank God, too,'' he said.  ``Can you tell me how you

are, dear?  Is there any difference?''



``Yes,'' she answered.  ``I grow tired lying so long,

but there isn't the ghost of an ache in my bones.  I can

just feel pure, delicious blood running in my veins.  My

hands and feet are always warm, and my head cool.''



The Harvester's face drew very close.  ``How about

your heart, honey?'' he whispered.  ``Anything new there?''



``Yes, I am all over new inside and out.  I want to

shout, run, sing, and swim.  Oh I'd give anything to

have you carry me down and dip me in the lake right

now.''



``Soon, Girl!  That will come soon,'' prophesied the

Harvester.



``I scarcely can wait.  And you did say a saddle,

didn't you?  Won't it be great to come galloping up the

levee, when the leaves are red and the frost is in the air. 

Oh am I going fast enough?''



``Much faster than I expected,'' said the Harvester. 

``You are surprising all of us, me most of any.  Ruth,

you almost make me hope that you regard this as home. 

Honey, you are thinking a little of me these days?''



The hand that had fallen from his hair lay on his

shoulder.  Now it slid around his neck, and gripped him with

all its strength.



``Heaps and heaps!'' she said.  ``All I get a chance to,

for being bothered and fussed over, and everlastingly

read mushy stuff that's intended for some one else. 

Please take me to the veranda now; I want to tell you

something.''



His head swam, but the Harvester set his feet firmly,

arose, and carried his Dream Girl back to outdoor life. 

When he reached the chair, she begged him to go a few

steps farther to the bench on the lake shore.



``I am afraid,'' said the man.



``It's so warm.  There can't be any difference in the

air.  Just a minute.''



The Harvester pushed open the screen, went to the

bench, and seating himself, drew the cover closely around

her.



``Don't speak a word for a long time,'' he said.  ``Just

rest.  If I tire you too much and spoil everything, I

will be desperate.''



He clasped her to him, laid his cheek against her hair,

and his lips on her forehead.  He held her hand and

kissed it over and over, and again he watched and could

find no resentment.  The cool, pungent breeze swept

from the lake, and the voices of wild life chattered at

their feet.  Sometimes the water folks splashed, while a

big black and gold butterfly mistook the Girl's dark hair

for a perching place and settled on it, slowly opening

its wonderful wings.



``Lie quietly, Girl,'' whispered the Harvester.  ``You

are wearing a living jewel, an ornament above price, on

your hair.  Maybe you can see it when it goes.  There!''



``Oh I did!'' she cried.  ``How I love it here!  Before

long may I lie in the dining-room window a while so I

can see the water.  I like the hill, but I love the lake

more.''



``Now if you just would love me,'' said the

Harvester, ``you would have all Medicine Woods in your

heart.''



``Don't hurry me so!'' said the Girl.  ``You gave me a

year; and it's only a few weeks, and I've not been myself,

and I'm not now.  I mustn't make any mistake, and all

I know for sure is that I want you most, and I can rest

best with you, and I miss you every minute you are

gone.  I think that should satisfy you.''



``That would be enough for any reasonable man,''

said the Harvester angrily.  ``Forgive me, Ruth, I have

been cruel.  I forgot how frail and weak you are.  It is

having Harmon here that makes me unnatural.  It almost

drives me to frenzy to know that he may take you

from me.''



``Then send him away!''



``SEND HIM AWAY?''



``Yes, send him away!  I am tired to death of his

poetry, and seeing him spoon around.  Send both of

them away quickly!''



The Harvester gulped, blinked, and surreptitiously felt

for her pulse.



``Oh, I've not developed fever again,'' she said.  ``I'm

all right.  But it must be a fearful expense to have both

of them here by the week, and I'm so tired of them,

Granny says she can take care of me just as well, and the

girl who helps her can cook.  No one but you shall lift

me, if I don't get my nose Out until I can walk alone

Both of them are perfectly useless, and I'd much rather

you'd send them away.''



``There, there!  Of course!'' said the Harvester

soothingly.  ``I'll do it as soon as I possibly dare.  You

don't understand, honey.  You are yet delicate beyond

measure, internally.  The fever burned so long.  Every

morsel you eat is measured and cooked in sterilized vessels,

and I'd be scared of my life to have the girl undertake it.''



``Why she is doing it straight along now!  She and

Granny!  Molly isn't out of Doctor Harmon's sight long

enough to cook anything.  Granny says there is `a lot of

buncombe about what they do, and she is going to tell

them so right to their teeth some of these days, if they

badger her much more,' and I wish she would, and you,

too.''



The Harvester gathered the Girl to him in one

crushing bear hug.



``For the love of Heaven, Ruth, you drive me crazy! 

Answer me just one question.  When you told me that

you `adored and worshipped' Doctor Harmon, did you

mean it, or was that the delirium of fever?''



``I don't know WHAT I told you!  If I said I `adored'

him, it was the truth.  I did!  I do!  I always will! 

So do I adore the Almighty, but that's no sign I want

him to read poetry to me, and be around all the time

when I am wild for a minute with you.  I can worship

Doctor Harmon in Chicago or Onabasha quite as well. 

Fire him!  If you don't, I will!''



``Good Lord!'' cried the Harvester, helpless until

the Girl had to cling to him to prevent rolling from his

nerveless arms.  ``Ruth, Ruth, will you feel my pulse?''



``No, I won't!  But you are going to drop me.  Take

me straight back to my beautiful new bed, and send them

away.''



``A minute!  Give me a minute!'' gasped the

Harvester.  ``I couldn't lift a baby just now.  Ruth, dear, I

thought you LOVED the man.''



``What made you think so?''



``You did!''



``I didn't either!  I never said I loved him.  I said

I was under obligations to him; but they are as well

repaid as they ever can be.  I said I adored him, and I

tell you I do!  Give him what we owe him, both of us,

in money, and send them away.  If you'd seen as much

of them as I have, you'd be tired of them, too.  Please,

please, David!''



``Yes,'' said the Harvester, arising in a sudden tide

of effulgent joy.  ``Yes, Girl, just as quickly as I can

with decency.  I----I'll send them on the lake, and I'll

take care of you.''



``You won't read poetry to me?''



``I will not.''



``You won't moon at me?''



``No!''



``Then hurry!  But have them take your boat.  I am

going to have the first ride in mine.''



``Indeed you are, and soon, too!'' said the Harvester,

marching up the hill as if he were leading hosts to

battle.



He laid the Girl on the bed and covered her, and called

Granny Moreland to sit beside her a few minutes.  He

went into the gold garden and proposed that the doctor

and the nurse go rowing until supper time, and they

went with alacrity.  When they started he returned to

the Girl and, sitting beside her, he told Granny to take

a nap.  Then he began to talk softly all about wild music,

and how it was made, and what the different odours

sweeping down the hill were, and when the red leaves

would come, and the nuts rattle down, and the frost

fairies enamel the windows, and soon she was sound asleep. 

Granny came back, and the Harvester walked around

the lake shore to be alone a while and think quietly,

for he was almost too dazed and bewildered for full

realization.



As he softly followed the foot path he heard voices,

and looking down, he saw the boat lying in the shade and

beneath a big tree on the bank sat the doctor and the

nurse.  His arm was around her, and her head was on

his shoulder; and she said very distinctly, ``How long

will it be until we can go without offending him?''
