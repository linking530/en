THE CHIME OF THE BLUE BELLS



The Harvester finished his evening work and went

to examine the cocoons.  Many of the moths

had emerged and flown, but the luna cases remained

in the bottom of the box.  As he stood looking

at them one moved and he smiled.



``I'd give something if you would come out and be

ready to work on by to-morrow afternoon,'' he said. 

``Possibly you would so interest her that she would

forget her fear of me.  I'd like mighty well to take

you along, because she might care for you, and I do need

the pattern for my candlestick.  Believe I'll lay you in

a warmer place.''



The first thing the next morning the Harvester looked

and found the open cocoon and the wet moth clinging

by its feet to a twig he had placed for it.



``Luck is with me!'' he exulted.  ``I'll carry you to

her and be mighty careful what I say, and maybe she will

forget about the fear.''



All the forenoon he cut and spread boneset, saffron,

and hemlock on the trays to dry.  At noon he put on a

fresh outfit, ate a hasty lunch, and drove to Onabasha.

He carried the moth in a box, and as he started he picked

up a rake.  He went to an art store and bought the

pencils and paper she had ordered.  He wanted to purchase

everything he saw for her, but he was fast learning

a lesson of deep caution.  If he took more than she

ordered, she would worry over paying, and if he refused

to accept money, she would put that everlasting ``why''

at him again.  The water-colour paper and paint he could

not forego.  He could make a desire to have the moth

coloured explain those, he thought.



Then he went to a furniture store and bought several

articles, and forgetting his law against haste, he drove

Betsy full speed to the river.  He was rather heavily

ladened as he went up the bank, and it was only one

o'clock.  There was an hour.  He rolled away the log,

raked together and removed the leaves to the ground. 

He tramped the earth level and spread a large cheap porch

rug.  On this he opened and placed a little folding table

and chair.  On the table he spread the pencils, paper,

colour box and brushes, and went to the river to fill

the water cup.  Then he sat on the log he had rolled

to one side and waited.  After two hours he arose and

crept as close the house as he could through the woods,

but he could not secure a glimpse of the Girl.  He

went back and waited an hour more, and then undid

his work and removed it.  When he came to the moth

his face was very grim as he lifted the twig and helped

the beautiful creature to climb on a limb.  ``You'll

be ready to fly in a few hours,'' he said.  ``If I keep you

in a box you will ruin your wings and be no suitable

subject, and put you in a cyanide jar I will not.  I am

hurt too badly myself.  I wonder if what Doc said was

the right way!  It's certainly a temptation.''



Then he went home; and again Betsy veered at the

hospital, and once more the Harvester explained to her

that he did not want to see the doctor.  That evening

and the following forenoon were difficult, but the Harvester

lived through them, and in the afternoon went back

to the woods, spread his rug, and set up the table.  Only

one streak of luck brightened the gloom in his heart. 

A yellow emperor had emerged in the night, and now

occupied the place of yesterday's luna.  She never need

know it was not the one he wanted, and it would make

an excuse for the colour box.



He was watching intently and saw her coming a long

way off.  He noticed that she looked neither right nor

left, but came straight as if walking a bridge.  As she

reached the place she glanced hastily around and then

at him.  The Harvester forgave her everything as he

saw the look of relief with which she stepped upon the

carpet.  Then she turned to him.



``I won't have to ask `why' this time,'' she said.  ``I

know that you did it because I was baby enough to tell

what a coward I am.  I'm sure you can't afford it, and

I know you shouldn't have done it, but oh, what a

comfort!  If you will promise never to do any such

expensive, foolish, kind thing again, I'll say thank you

this time.  I couldn't come yesterday, because Aunt Molly 

was worse and Uncle Henry was at home all day.''



``I supposed it was something like that,'' said the

Harvester.



She advanced and handed him the roll of bills.



``I had a feeling you would be reckless,'' she said.  ``I

saw it in your face, so I came back as soon as I could

steal away, and sure enough, there lay your money and

the books and everything.  I hid them in the thicket,

so they will be all right.  I've almost prayed it wouldn't

rain.  I didn't dare carry them to the house.  Please

take the money.  I haven't time to argue about it or

strength, but of course I can't possibly use it unless

I earn it.  I'm so anxious to see the pencils and

paper.''



The Harvester thrust the money into his pocket.  The

Girl went to the table, opened and spread the paper,

and took out the pencils.



``Is my subject in here?'' she touched the colour box.



``No, the other.''



``Is it alive?  May I open it?''



``We will be very careful at first,'' said the Harvester. 

``It only left its case in the night and may fly.  When

the weather is so warm the wings develop rapidly.  Perhaps

if I remove the lid----''



He took off the cover, exposing a big moth, its lovely,

pale yellow wings, flecked with heliotrope, outspread as

it clung to a twig in the box.  The Girl leaned forward.



``What is it?'' she asked.



``One of the big night moths that emerge and fly a

few hours in June.''



``Is this what you want for your candlestick?''



``If I can't do better.  There is one other I prefer,

but it may not come at a time that you can get it right.''



``What do you mean by `right'?''



``So that you can copy it before it wants to fly.''



``Why don't you chloroform and pin it until I am

ready?''



``I am not in the business of killing and impaling

exquisite creatures like that.''



``Do you mean that if I can't draw it when it is just

right you will let it go?''



``I do.''



``Why?''



``I told you why.''



``I know you said you were not in the business, but why

wouldn't you take only one you really wanted to use?''



``I would be afraid,'' replied the Harvester.



``Afraid?  You!''



``I must have a mighty good reason before I kill,''

said the man.  ``I cannot give life; I have no right to

take it away.  I will let my statement stand.  I am

afraid.''



``Of what please?''



``An indefinable something that follows me and makes

me suffer if I am wantonly cruel.''



``Is there any particular pose in which you want this

bird placed?''



``Allow me to present you to the yellow emperor,

known in the books as eacles imperialis,'' he said.  ``I

want him as he clings naturally and life size.''



She took up a pencil.



``If you don't mind,'' said the Harvester, ``would you

draw on this other paper?  I very much want the colour,

also, and you can use it on this.  I brought a box along,

and I'll get you water.  I had it all ready yesterday.''



``Did you have this same moth?''



``No, I had another.''



``Did you have the one you wanted most?''



``Yes----but it's no difference.''



``And you let it go because I was not here?''



``No.  It went on account of exquisite beauty.  If

kept in confinement it would struggle and break its

wings.  You see, that one was a delicate green, where

this is yellow, plain pale blue green, with a lavender

rib here, and long curled trailers edged with pale yellow,

and eye spots rimmed with red and black.''



As the Harvester talked he indicated the points of

difference with a pencil he had picked up; now he laid it

down and retreated beyond the limits of the rug.



``I see,'' said the Girl.  ``And this is colour?''



She touched the box.



``A few colours, rather,'' said the Harvester.  ``I

selected enough to fill the box, with the help of the clerk

who sold them to me.  If they are not right, I have

permission to return and exchange them for anything you

want.''



With eager fingers she opened the box, and bent over

it a face filled with interest.



``Oh how I've always wanted this!  I scarcely can

wait to try it.  I do hope I can have it for my very own. 

Was it quite expensive?''



``No.  Very cheap!'' said the Harvester.  ``The paper

isn't worth mentioning.  The little, empty tin box was

only a few cents, and the paints differ according to

colour.  Some appear to be more than others.  I was

surprised that the outfit was so inexpensive.''



A skeptical little smile wavered on the Girl's face as

she drew her slender fingers across the trays of bright

colour.



``If one dared accept your word, you really would be

a comfort,'' she said, as she resolutely closed the box,

pushed it away, and picked up a pencil.



``If you will take the trouble to inquire at the banks,

post office, express office, hospital or of any druggist

in Onabasha, you will find that my word is exactly as

good as my money, and taken quite as readily.''



``I didn't say I doubted you.  I have no right to

do that until I feel you deceive me.  What I said was

`dared accept,' which means I must not, because I have

no right.  But you make one wonder what you would

do if you were coaxed and asked for things and led by

insinuations.''



``I can tell you that,'' said the Harvester.  ``It would

depend altogether on who wanted anything of me and

what they asked.  If you would undertake to coax and

insinuate, you never would get it done, because I'd see

what you needed and have it at hand before you had

time.''



The Girl looked at him wonderingly.



``Now don't spring your recurrent `why' on me,''

said the Harvester.  ``I'll tell you `why' some of these

days.  Just now answer me this question:  Do you want

me to remain here or leave until you finish?  Which

way would you be least afraid?''



``I am not at all afraid on the rug and with my work,''

she said.  ``If you want to hunt ginseng go by all

means.''



``I don't want to hunt anything,'' said the Harvester. 

``But if you are more comfortable with me away, I'll

be glad to go.  I'll leave the dog with you.''



He gave a short whistle and Belshazzar came bounding

to him.  The Harvester stepped to the Girl's side,

and dropping on one knee, he drew his hand across the

rug close to her skirts.



``Right here, Belshazzar,'' he said.  ``Watch!  You

are on guard, Bel.''



``Well of all names for a dog!'' exclaimed the Girl. 

``Why did you select that?''



``My mother named my first dog Belshazzar, and

taught me why; so each of the three I've owned since have

been christened the same.  It means `to protect' and

that is the office all of them perform; this one especially

has filled it admirably.  Once I failed him, but

he never has gone back on me.  You see he is not a

particle afraid of me.  Every step I take, he is at my

heels.''



``So was Bill Sikes' dog, if I remember.''



The Harvester laughed.



``Bel,'' he said, ``if you could speak you'd say that was

an ugly one, wouldn't you?''



The dog sprang up and kissed the face of the man

and rubbed a loving head against his breast.



``Thank you!'' said the Harvester.  ``Now lie down

and protect this woman as carefully as you ever watched

in your life.  And incidentally, Bel, tell her that she

can't exterminate me more than once a day, and the

performance is accomplished for the present.  I refuse

to be a willing sacrifice.  `So was Bill Sikes' dog!'  What

do you think of that, Bel?''



The Harvester arose and turned to go.



``What if this thing attempts to fly?'' she asked.



``Your pardon,'' said the Harvester.  ``If the emperor

moves, slide the lid over the box a few seconds, until he

settles and clings quietly again, and then slowly draw it

away.  If you are careful not to jar the table heavily

he will not go for hours yet.''



Again he turned.



``If there is no danger, why do you leave the dog?''



``For company,'' said the Harvester.  ``I thought

you would prefer an animal you are not afraid of to a

man you are.  But let me tell you there is no necessity

for either.  I know a woman who goes alone and unafraid

through every foot of woods in this part of the

country.  She has climbed, crept, and waded, and she

tells me she never saw but two venomous snakes this

side of Michigan.  Nothing ever dropped on her or

sprang at her.  She feels as secure in the woods as she

does at home.''



``Isn't she afraid of snakes?''



``She dislikes snakes, but she is not afraid or she would

not risk encountering them daily.''



``Do you ever find any?''



``Harmless little ones, often.  That is, Bel does.  He

is always nosing for them, because he understands that

I work in the earth.  I think I have encountered three

dangerous ones in my life.  I will guarantee you will

not find one in these woods.  They are too open and

too much cleared.''



``Then why leave the dog?''



``I thought,'' said the Harvester patiently, ``that your

uncle might have turned in some of his cattle, or if pigs

came here the dog could chase them away.''



She looked at him with utter panic in her face.



``I am far more afraid of a cow than a snake!'' she

cried.  ``It is so much bigger!''



``How did you ever come into these woods alone far

enough to find the ginseng?'' asked the Harvester. 

``Answer me that!''



``I wore Uncle Henry's top boots and carried a rake,

and I suffered tortures,'' she replied.



``But you hunted until you found what you wanted,

and came again to keep watch on it?''



``I was driven--simply forced.  There's no use to

discuss it!''



``Well thank the Lord for one thing,'' said the

Harvester.  ``You didn't appear half so terrified at the sight

of me as you did at the mere mention of a cow.  I have

risen inestimably in my own self-respect.  Belshazzar,

you may pursue the elusive chipmunk.  I am going to

guard this woman myself, and please, kind fates, send

a ferocious cow this way, in order that I may prove my

valour.''



The Girl's face flushed slightly, and she could not

restrain a laugh.  That was all the Harvester hoped for

and more.  He went beyond the edge of the rug and

sat on the leaves under a tree.  She bent over her work

and only bird and insect notes and occasionally Belshazzar's

excited bark broke the silence.  The Harvester

stretched on the ground, his eyes feasting on the Girl. 

Intensely he watched every movement.  If a squirrel

barked she gave a nervous start, so precipitate it seemed

as if it must hurt.  If a windfall came rattling down

she appeared ready to fly in headlong terror in any

direction.  At last she dropped her pencil and looked

at him helplessly.



``What is it?'' he asked.



``The silence and these awful crashes when one doesn't

know what is coming,'' she said.



``Will it bother you if I talk?  Perhaps the sound

of my voice will help?''



``I am accustomed to working when people talk, and it

will be a comfort.  I may be able to follow you, and that

will prevent me from thinking.  There are dreadful things

in my mind when they are not driven out.  Please talk! 

Tell me about the herbs you gathered this morning.''



The Harvester gave the Girl one long look as she bent

over her work.  He was vividly conscious of the graceful

curves of her little figure, the coil of dark, silky hair,

softly waving around her temples and neck, and when her

eyes turned in his direction he knew that it was only the

white, drawn face that restrained him.  He was almost

forced to tell her how he loved and longed for her; about

the home he had prepared; of a thousand personal

interests.  Instead, he took a firm grip and said casually,

``Foxglove harvest is over.  This plant has to be taken

when the leaves are in second year growth and at bloom

time.  I have stripped my mullein beds of both leaves

and flowers.  I finished a week ago.  Beyond lies a

stretch of Parnassus grass that made me think of you,

it was so white and delicate.  I want you to see it.  It

will be lovely in a few weeks more.''



``You never had seen me a week ago.''



``Oh hadn't I?'' said the Harvester.  ``Well maybe

I dreamed about you then.  I am a great dreamer. 

Once I had a dream that may interest you some day,

after you've overcome your fear of me.  Now this bed

of which I was speaking is a picture in September.  You

must arrange to drive home with me and see it then.''



``For what do you sell foxglove and mullein?''



``Foxglove for heart trouble, and mullein for catarrh. 

I get ten cents a pound for foxglove leaves and five for

mullein and from seventy-five to a dollar for flowers

of the latter, depending on how well I preserve the colour

in drying them.  They must be sealed in bottles and

handled with extreme care.''



``Then if I wasn't too childish to be out picking them,

I could be earning seventy-five cents a pound for mullein

blooms?''



``Yes,'' said the Harvester, ``but until you learned the

trick of stripping them rapidly you scarcely could gather

what would weigh two pounds a day, when dried.  Not

to mention the fact that you would have to stand and

work mostly in hot sunshine, because mullein likes open

roads and fields and sunny hills.  Now you can sit securely

in the shade, and in two hours you can make me a

pattern of that moth, for which I would pay a designer

of the arts and crafts shop five dollars, so of course you

shall have the same.''



``Oh no!'' she cried in swift panic.  ``You were charged

too much!  It isn't worth a dollar, even!''



``On the contrary the candlestick on which I shall

use it will be invaluable when I finish it, and five is

very little for the cream of my design.  I paid just

right.  You can earn the same for all you can do.  If

you can embroider linen, they pay good prices for that,

too and wood carving, metal work, or leather things. 

May I see how you are coming on?''



``Please do,'' she said.



The Harvester sprang up and looked over the Girl's

shoulder.  He could not suppress an exclamation of

delight.



``Perfect!'' he cried.  ``You can surpass their best

drafting at the shop!  Your fortune is made.  Any time

you want to go to Onabasha you can make enough to

pay your board, dress you well, and save something every

week.  You must leave here as soon as you can manage

it.  When can you go?''



``I don't know,'' she said wearily.  ``I'd hate to tell

you how full of aches I am.  I could not work much just

now, if I had the best opportunities in the world.  I

must grow stronger.''



``You should not work at anything until you are well,''

he said.  ``It is a crime against nature to drive yourself. 

Why will you not allow----''



``Do you really think, with a little practice, I can

draw designs that will sell?''



The Harvester picked up the sheet.  The work was

delicate and exact.  He could see no way to improve it.



``You know it will sell,'' he said gently, ``because you

already have sold such work.''



``But not for the prices you offer.''



``The prices I name are going to be for NEW, ORIGINAL

DESIGNS.  I've got a thousand in my head, that old

Mother Nature shows me in the woods and on the water

every day.''



``But those are yours; I can't take them.''



``You must,'' said the Harvester.  ``I only see and

recognize studies; I can't materialize them, and until

they are drawn, no one can profit by them.  In this

partnership we revolutionize decorative art.  There

are actually birds besides fat robins and nondescript

swallows.  The crane and heron do not monopolize the water. 

Wild rose and golden-rod are not the only flowers.  The

other day I was gathering lobelia.  The seeds are used

in tonic preparations.  It has an upright stem with

flowers scattered along it.  In itself it is not much, but

close beside it always grows its cousin, tall bell-flower. 

As the name indicates, the flowers are bell shape and

I can't begin to describe their grace, beauty, and delicate

blue colour.  They ring my strongest call to worship. 

My work keeps me in the woods so much I remain

there for my religion also.  Whenever I find these

flowers I always pause for a little service of my own

that begins by reciting these lines:



     `` 'Neath cloistered boughs, each floral bell that swingeth

          And tolls its perfume on the passing air,

     Makes Sabbath in the fields, and ever ringeth

          A call to prayer.''





``Beautiful!'' said the Girl.



``It's mighty convenient,'' explained the Harvester. 

``By my method, you see, you don't have to wait for

your day and hour of worship.  Anywhere the blue bell

rings its call it is Sunday in the woods and in your heart. 

After I recite that, I pray my prayer.''



``Go on!'' said the Girl.  ``This is no place to stop.''



``It is always one and the same prayer, and there are

only two lines of it,'' said the Harvester.  ``It runs this

way----  Let me take your pencil and I will write it

for you.''



He bent over her shoulder, and traced these lines on

a scrap of the wrapping paper:



               ``Almighty Evolver of the Universe:

          Help me to keep my soul and body clean,

     And at all times to do unto others as I would be done by.

                         Amen.''





The Girl took the slip and sat studying it; then she

raised her eyes to his face curiously, but with a tinge of

awe in them.



``I can see you standing over a blue, bell-shaped

flower reciting those exquisite lines and praying this

wonderful prayer,'' she said.  ``Yesterday you allowed

the moth you were willing to pay five dollars for a drawing

of, to go, because you wouldn't risk breaking its wings. 

Why you are more like a woman!''



A red stream crimsoned the Harvester's face.



``Well heretofore I have been considered strictly

masculine,'' he said.  ``To appreciate beauty or to try to

be just commonly decent is not exclusively feminine. 

You must remember there are painters, poets, musicians,

workers in art along almost any line you could

mention, and no one calls them feminine, but there is

one good thing if I am.  You need no longer fear me. 

If you should see me, muck covered, grubbing in the

earth or on a raft washing roots in the lake, you would

not consider me like a woman.''



``Would it be any discredit if I did?  I think not. 

I merely meant that most men would not see or hear

the blue bell at all----and as for the poem and prayer! 

If the woods make a man with such fibre in his soul,

I must learn them if they half kill me.''



``You harp on death.  Try to forget the word.''



``I have faced it for months, and seen it do its grinding

worst very recently to the only thing on earth I loved or

that loved me.  I have no desire to forget!  Tell me

more about the plants.''



``Forgive me,'' said the Harvester gently.  ``Just

now I am collecting catnip for the infant and nervous

people, hoarhound for colds and dyspepsia, boneset heads

and flowers for the same purpose.  There is a heavy head

of white bloom with wonderful lacy leaves, called yarrow. 

I take the entire plant for a tonic and blessed thistle

leaves and flowers for the same purpose.''



``That must be what I need,'' interrupted the Girl. 

``Half the time I believe I have a little fever, but I

couldn't have dyspepsia, because I never want anything

to eat; perhaps the tonic would make me hungry.''



``Promise me you will tell that to the doctor who

comes to see your aunt, and take what he gives you.''



``No doctor comes to see my aunt.  She is merely

playing lazy to get out of work.  There is nothing the

matter with her.''



``Then why----''



``My uncle says that.  Really, she could not stand and

walk across a room alone.  She is simply worn out.''



``I shall report the case,'' said the Harvester instantly.



``You better not!'' said the Girl.  ``There must be a

mistake about you knowing my uncle.  Tell me more

of the flowers.''



The Harvester drew a deep breath and continued:



``These I just have named I take at bloom time;

next month come purple thorn apple, jimson weed, and

hemlock.''



``Isn't that poison?''



``Half the stuff I handle is.''



``Aren't you afraid?''



``Terribly,'' said the Harvester in laughing voice. 

``But I want the money, the sick folk need the medicine,

and I drink water.''



The Girl laughed also.



``Look here!'' said the Harvester.  ``Why not tell

me just as closely as you can about your aunt, and

let me fix something for her; or if you are afraid to

trust me, let me have my friend of whom I spoke yesterday.''



``Perhaps I am not so much afraid as I was,'' said

the Girl.  ``I wish I could!  How could I explain where

I got it and I wonder if she would take it.''



``Give it to her without any explanation,'' said the

Harvester.  ``Tell her it will make her stronger and she

must use it.  Tell me exactly how she is, and I will fix

up some harmless remedies that may help, and can do

no harm.''



``She simply has been neglected, overworked, and

abused until she has lain down, turned her face to the

wall, and given up hope.  I think it is too late.  I

think the end will come soon.  But I wish you would

try.  I'll gladly pay----''



``Don't!'' said the Harvester.  ``Not for things that

grow in the woods and that I prepare.  Don't think of

money every minute.''



``I must,'' she said with forced restraint.  ``It is the

price of life.  Without it one suffers----horribly----

as I know.  What other plants do you gather?''



``Saffron,'' answered the Harvester.  ``A beautiful

thing!  You must see it.  Tall, round stems, lacy, delicate

leaves, big heads of bright yellow bloom, touched

with colour so dark it appears black--one of the loveliest

plants that grows.  You should see my big bed of it in

a week or two more.  It makes a picture.''



The words recalled him to the Girl.  He turned to

study her.  He forgot his commission and chafed at

conventions that prevented his doing what he saw was

required so urgently.  Fearing she would notice, he

gazed away through the forest and tried to think, to

plan.



``You are not making noise enough,'' she said.



So absorbed was the Harvester he scarcely heard her. 

In an attempt to obey he began to whistle softly.  A

tiny goldfinch in a nest of thistle down and plant fibre

in the branching of a bush ten feet above him stuck her

head over the brim and inquired, ``P'tseet?''  ``Pt'see!''

answer the Harvester.  That began the duet.  Before

the question had been asked and answered a half dozen

times a catbird intruded its voice and hearing a reply

came through the bushes to investigate.  A wren followed

and became very saucy.  From----one could not see

where, came a vireo, and almost at the same time a

chewink had something to say.



Instantly the Harvester answered.  Then a blue jay

came chattering to ascertain what all the fuss was about,

and the Harvester carried on a conversation that called

up the remainder of the feathered tribe.  A brilliant

cardinal came tearing through the thicket, his beady

black eyes snapping, and demanded to know if

any one were harming his mate, brooding under a

wild grape leaf in a scrub elm on the river embankment. 

A brown thrush silently slipped like a snake between

shrubs and trees, and catching the universal excitement,

began to flirt his tail and utter a weird, whistling

cry.



With one eye on the bird, and the other on the Girl

sitting in amazed silence, the Harvester began working

for effect.  He lay quietly, but in turn he answered a

dozen birds so accurately they thought their mates were

calling, and closer and closer they came.  An oriole in

orange and black heard his challenge, and flew up the

river bank, answering at steady intervals for quite a

time before it was visible, and in resorting to the last

notes he could think of a quail whistled ``Bob White''

and a shitepoke, skulking along the river bank, stopped

and cried, ``Cowk, cowk!''



At his limit of calls the Harvester changed his notes

and whistled and cried bits of bird talk in tone with

every mellow accent and inflection he could manage. 

Gradually the excitement subsided, the birds flew and

tilted closer, turned their sleek heads, peered with bright

eyes, and ventured on and on until the very bravest,

the wren and the jay, were almost in touch.  Then,

tired of hunting, Belshazzar came racing and the little

feathered people scattered in precipitate flight.



``How do you like that kind of a noise?'' inquired the

Harvester.



The Girl drew a deep breath.



``Of course you know that was the most exquisite

sight I ever saw,'' she said.  ``I never shall forget it. 

I did not think there were that many different birds in

the whole world.  Of all the gaudy colours!  And they

came so close you could have reached out and touched

them.''



``Yes,'' said the Harvester calmly.  ``Birds are never

afraid of me.  At Medicine Woods, when I call them

like that, many, most of them, in fact, eat from my

hand.  If you ever have looked at me enough to notice

bulgy pockets, they are full of wheat.  These birds

are strangers, but I'll wager you that in a week I can

make them take food from me.  Of course, my own

birds know me, because they are around every day. 

It is much easier to tame them in winter, when the

snow has fallen and food is scarce, but it only takes

a little while to win a bird's confidence at any

season.''



``Birds don't know what there is to be afraid of,''

she said.



``Your pardon,'' said the Harvester, ``but I am familiar

with them, and that is not correct.  They have more

to fear than human beings.  No one is going to kill you

merely to see if he can shoot straight enough to hit. 

Your life is not in danger because you have magnificent

hair that some woman would like for an ornament. 

You will not be stricken out in a flash because there are

a few bits of meat on your frame some one wants to eat. 

No one will set a seductive trap for you, and, if you are

tempted to enter it, shut you from freedom and natural

diet, in a cage so small you can't turn around without

touching bars.  You are in a secure and free position

compared with the birds.  I also have observed that

they know guns, many forms of traps, and all of them

decide by the mere manner of a man's passing

through the woods whether he is a friend or an

enemy.  Birds know more than many people realize. 

They do not always correctly estimate gun range, they

are foolishly venturesome at times when they want

food, but they know many more things than most

people give them credit for understanding.  The greatest

trouble with the birds is they are too willing

to trust us and be friendly, so they are often

deceived.''



``That sounds as if you were right,'' said the Girl.



``I am of the woods, so I know I am,'' answered the

Harvester.



``Will you look at this now?''



He examined the drawing closely.



``Where did you learn?'' he inquired.



``My mother.  She was educated to her finger tips. 

She drew, painted, played beautifully, sang well, and she

had read almost all the best books.  Besides what I learned

at high school she taught me all I know.  Her embroidery

always brought higher prices than mine, try as I

might.  I never saw any one else make such a dainty,

accurate little stitch as she could.''



``If this is not perfect, I don't know how to criticise

it.  I can and will use it in my work.  But I have one

luna cocoon remaining and I would give ten dollars for

such a drawing of the moth before it flies.  It may open

to-night or not for several days.  If your aunt should

be worse and you cannot come to-morrow and the moth

emerges, is there any way in which I could send it to

you?''



``What could I do with it?''



``I thought perhaps you could take a piece of paper

and the pencils with you, and secure an outline

in your room.  It need not be worked up with

all the detail in this.  Merely a skeleton sketch would

do.  Could I leave it at the house or send it with

some one?''



``No!  Oh no!'' she cried.  ``Leave it here.  Put it

in a box in the bushes where I hid the books. 

What are you going to do with these things?''



``Hide them in the thicket and scatter leaves over

them.''



``What if it rains?''



``I have thought of that.  I brought a few yards of

oilcloth to-day and they will be safe and dry if it pours.''



``Good!'' she said.  ``Then if the moth comes out

you bring it, and if I am not here, put it under the cloth

and I will run up some time in the afternoon.  But

if I were you, I would not spread the rug until you

know if I can remain.  I have to steal every minute I

am away, and any day uncle takes a notion to stay at

home I dare not come.''



``Try to come to-morrow.  I am going to bring some

medicine for your aunt.''



``Put it under the cloth if I am not here; but I will

come if I can.  I must go now; I have been away far

too long.''



The Harvester picked up one of the drug pamphlets,

laid the drawing inside it, and placed it with his other

books.  Then he drew out his pocket book and laid a

five-dollar bill on the table and began folding up the

chair and putting away the things.  The Girl looked at

the money with eager eyes.



``Is that honestly what you would pay at the arts

and crafts place?''



``It is the customary price for my patterns.''



``And are you sure this is as good?''



``I can bring you some I have paid that for, and let

you see for yourself that it is better.''



``I wish you would!'' she cried eagerly.  ``I need that

money, and I would like to have it dearly, if I really have

earned it, but I can't touch it if I have not.''



``Won't you accept my word?''



``No.  I will see the other drawings first, and if I

think mine are as good, I will be glad to take the money

to-morrow.''



``What if you can't come?''



``Put them under the oilcloth.  I watch all the time

and I think Uncle Henry has trained even the boys so

they don't play in the river on his land.  I never see a

soul here; the woods, house, and everything is desolate

until he comes home and then it is like----'' she paused.



``I'll say it for you,'' said the Harvester promptly. 

``Then it is like hell.''



``At its worst,'' supplemented the Girl.  Taking pencils

and a sheet of paper she went swiftly through the woods. 

Before she left the shelter of the trees, the Harvester

saw her busy her hands with the front of her dress, and

he knew that she was concealing the drawing material. 

The colour box was left, and he said things as he put

it with the chair and table, covered them with the rug

and oilcloth, and heaped on a layer of leaves.



Then he drove to the city and Betsy turned at the

hospital corner with no interference.  He could face his

friend that day.  Despite all discouragements he felt

reassured.  He was progressing.  Means of communication

had been established.  If she did not come,

he could leave a note and tell her if the moth had not

emerged and how sorry he was to have missed seeing

her.



``Hello, lover!'' cried Doctor Carey as the Harvester

entered the office.  ``Are you married yet?''



``No.  But I'm going to be,'' said the Harvester with

confidence.



``Have you asked her?''



``No.  We are getting acquainted.  She is too close to

trouble, too ill, and too worried over a sick relative for

me to intrude myself; it would be brutal, but it's a

temptation.  Doc, is there any way to compel a man to provide

medical care for his wife?''



``Can he afford it?''



``Amply.  Anything!  Worth thousands in land and

nobody knows what in money.  It's Henry Jameson.''



``The meanest man I ever knew.  If he has a wife it's

a marvel she has survived this long.  Won't he provide

for her?''



``I suppose he thinks he has when she has a bed to lie

on and a roof to cover her.  He won't supply food she

can eat and medicine.  He says she is lazy.''



``What do you think?''



``I quote Miss Jameson.  She says her aunt is slowly

dying from overwork and neglect.''



``David, doesn't it seem pretty good, when you say

`Miss Jameson'?''



``Loveliest sound on earth, except the remainder of it.''



``What's that?''



``Ruth!''



``Jove! That is a beautiful name.  Ruth Langston. 

It will go well, won't it?''



``Music that the birds, insects, Singing Water, the

trees, and the breeze can't ever equal.  I'm holding on

with all my might, but it's tough, Doc.  She's in such a

dreadful place and position, and she needs so much. 

She is sick.  Can't you give me a prescription for each

of them?''



``You just bet I can,'' said the doctor, ``if you can

engineer their taking them.''



``I suppose you'd hold their noses and pour stuff down

them.''



``I would if necessary.''



``Well, it is.''



``All right----I'll fix something, and you see that

they use it.''



``I can try,'' said the Harvester.



``Try!  Pah!  You aren't half a man!''



``That's a half more than being a woman, anyway.''



``She called you feminine, did she?'' cried the doctor,

dancing and laughing.  ``She ought to see you harvesting

skunk cabbage and blue flag or when you are angry

enough.''



The doctor left the room and it was a half hour before

he returned.



``Try that on them according to directions,'' he said,

handing over a couple of bottles.



``Thank you!'' said the Harvester, ``I will!''



``That sounds manly enough.''



``Oh pother!  It's not that I'm not a man, or a laggard

in love; but I'd like to know what you'd do to a girl

dumb with grief over the recent loss of her mother, who

was her only relative worth counting, sick from God

knows what exposure and privation, and now a dying

relative on her hands.  What could you do?''



``I'd marry her and pick her out of it!''



``I wouldn't have her, if she'd leave a sick woman for

me!''



``I wouldn't either.  She's got to stick it out until

her aunt grows better, and then I'll go out there and

show you how to court a girl.''



``I guess not!  You keep the girl you did court, courted,

and you'll have your hands full.  How does that appear

to you?''



The Harvester opened the pamphlet he carried and

held up the drawing of the moth.



The doctor turned to the light.



``Good work!'' he cried.  ``Did she do that?''



``She did.  In a little over an hour.''



``Fine!  She should have a chance.''



``She is going to.  She is going to have all the

opportunity that is coming to her.''



``Good for you, David!  Any time I can help!''



The Harvester replaced the sketch and went to the

wagon; but he left Belshazzar in charge, and visited the

largest dry goods store in Onabasha, where he held a

conference with the floor walker.  When he came out he

carried a heaping load of boxes of every size and shape,

with a label on each.  He drove to Medicine Woods

singing and whistling.



``She didn't want me to go, Belshazzar!'' he chuckled

to the dog.  ``She was more afraid of a cow than she

was of me.  I made some headway to-day, old boy. 

She doesn't seem to have a ray of an idea what I am

there for, but she is going to trust me soon now; that is

written in the books.  Oh I hope she will be there to-

morrow, and the luna will be out.  Got half a notion to

take the case and lay it in the warmest place I can find. 

But if it comes out and she isn't there, I'll be sorry. 

Better trust to luck.''



The Harvester stabled Betsy, fed the stock, and visited

with the birds.  After supper he took his purchases

and entered her room.  He opened the drawers of the

chest he had made, and selecting the labelled boxes he

laid them in.  But not a package did he open.  Then

he arose and radiated conceit of himself.



``I'll wager she will like those,'' he commented proudly,

``because Kane promised me fairly that he would have the

right things put up for a girl the size of the clerk I selected

for him, and exactly what Ruth should have.  That girl

was slenderer and not quite so tall, but he said everything

was made long on purpose.  Now what else should I get?''



He turned to the dressing table and taking a notebook

from his pocket made this list:

     Rugs for bed and bath room.

     Mattresses, pillows and bedding,

     Dresses for all occasions.

     All kinds of shoes and overshoes.





``There are gloves, too!'' exclaimed the Harvester. 

``She has to have some, but how am I going to know what

is right?  Oh, but she needs shoes!  High, low, slippers,

everything!  I wonder what that clerk wears.  I don't

believe shoes would be comfortable without being fitted,

or at least the proper size.  I wonder what kind of dresses

she likes.  I hope she's fond of white.  A woman always

appears loveliest in that.  Maybe I'd better buy what

I'm sure of and let her select the dresses.  But I'd love

to have this room crammed with girl-fixings when she

comes.  Doesn't seem as if she ever has had any little

luxuries.  I can't miss it on anything a woman uses. 

Let me think!''



Slowly he wrote again:

          Parasols.

          Fans.

          Veils.

          Hats.





``I never can get them!  I think that will keep me busy

for a few days,'' said the Harvester as he closed the door

softly, and went to look at the pupae cases.  Then he

carved on the vine of the candlestick for her dressing

table; with one arm around Belshazzar, re-read the story

of John Muir's dog, went into the lake, and to bed. 

Just as he was becoming unconscious the beast lifted an

inquiring head and gazed at the man.



``More 'fraid of cow,'' the Harvester was muttering

in a sleepy chuckle.
