THE COMING OF THE BLUEBIRD



The Harvester stopped at the mail box on his way

home and among the mass of matter it contained

was something from the Girl.  It was a scrap

as long as his least finger and three times as wide, and

by the postmark it had lain four days in the box.  On

opening it, he found only her card with a line written

across it, but the man went up the hill and into the

cabin as if a cyclone were driving him, for he read, ``Has

your bluebird come?''



He threw his travelling bag on the floor, ran to the

telephone, and called the station.  ``Take this message,'' he

said.  ``Mrs. David Langston, care of Alexander Herron,

5770 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia.  Found note after

four days' absence.  Bluebird long past due.  The fairies

have told it that my fate hereafter lies in your hands.



As always.  David.''



The Harvester turned from the instrument and bent

to embrace Belshazzar, leaping in ecstasy beside him.



``Understand that, Bel?'' he asked.  ``I don't know but

it means something.  Maybe it doesn't----not a thing! 

And again, there is a chance----only the merest

possibility----that it does.  We'll risk it, Bel, and to begin

on I have nailed it as hard as I knew how.  Next, we will

clean the house----until it shines, and then we will fill

the cupboard, and if anything does happen we won't be

caught napping.  Yes, boy, we will take the chance! 

We can't be any worse disappointed than we have been

before and survived it.  Come along!''



He picked up the bag and arranged its contents,

carefully brushed and folded on his shelves and in his

closet.  Then he removed the travelling suit, donned

the old brown clothes and went to the barn to see that

his creatures had been cared for properly.  Early the

next morning he awoke and after feeding and breakfasting

instead of going to harvest spice brush and alder he

stretched a line and hung the bedding from room after

room to air and sun.  He swept, dusted, and washed

windows, made beds, and lastly polished the floors

throughout the cabin.  He set everything in order,

and as a finishing touch, filled vases, pitchers, and bowls

with the bloom of red bud and silky willow catkins. 

He searched the south bank, but there was not a violet,

even in the most exposed places.  By night he was tired

and a little of the keen edge of his ardour was dulled. 

The next day he worked scrubbing the porches, straightening

the lawn and hedges, even sweeping the driveway

to the bridge clear of wind-whirled leaves and straw. 

He scouted around the dry-house and laboratory, and

spent several extra hours on the barn so that when

evening came everything was in perfect order.  Then he

dressed, ate his supper and drove to the city.





He stopped at the mail box, but there was nothing

from the Girl.  The Harvester did not know whether

he was sorry or glad.  A letter might have said the

same thing.  Nothing meant a delightful possibility, and

between the two he preferred the latter.  He whistled

and sang as he drove to Onabasha, and Belshazzar looked

at him with mystified eyes, for this was not the master

he had known of late.  He did not recognize the dress

or the manner, but his dog heart was sympathetic to

the man's every mood, and he remembered times when a

drive down the levee always had been like this, for to-

night the Harvester's tongue was loosened and he talked

in the old way.



``Just four words, Bel'' he said.  ``And, as I

remarked before, they may mean the most wonderful thing

on earth, and possibly nothing at all.  But it is in the

heart of man to hope, Bel, and so we are going to live

royally for a week or two, just on hope, old boy.  If

anything should happen, we are ready, rooms shining,

beds fresh, fireplaces filled and waiting a match, ice

chest cool, and when we get back it will be stored.  Also

a secret, Bel; we are going to a florist and a fruit store. 

While we are at it, we will do the thing right; but we will

stay away from Doc, until we are sure of something. 

He means well, but we don't like to be pitied, do we,

Bel?  Our friends don't manage their eyes and voices

very well these days.  Never mind!  Our time will come

yet.  The bluebird will not fail us, but never before has

it been so late.''



On his return he filled the pantry shelves with packages,

stored the ice chest, and set a basket of delicious fruit on

the dining table.  Two boxes remained.  He opened the

larger one and took from it an arm load of white lilies

that he carried up the hill and divided between the mounds

under the oak.  Then he uncovered his head, and standing

at the foot of them he looked among the boughs of

the big tree and listened intently.  After a time a soft,

warm wind, catkin-scented, crept from the lake, and

began a murmur among the clusters of brown leaves

clinging to the branches.



``Mother,'' said the Harvester, ``were you with me? 

Did I do it right?  Did I tell them what you would have

had me say for the boys?  Are you glad now you held

me to the narrow way?  Do you want me to go before

men if I am asked, as Doc says I will be, and tell them

that the only way to abolish pain is for them to begin

at the foundation by living clean lives?  I don't know

if I did any good, but they listened to me.  Anyway,

I did the best I knew.  But that isn't strange; you ground

it into me to do that every day, until it is almost an

instinct.  Mother, dear, can you tell me about the bluebird? 

Is that softest little rustle of all your voice?

and does it say `hope'?  I think so, and I thank you for

the word.''



The man's eyes dropped to earth.



``And you other mother,'' he said, ``have you any

message for me?  Up where you are can you sweep the

world with understanding eyes and tell me why my

bluebird does not come?  Does it know that this year

your child and not chance must settle my fate?  Can

you look across space and see if she is even thinking of

me?  But I know that!  She had to be thinking of me

when she wrote that line.  Rather can you tell me----

will she come?  Do you think I am man enough to be

trusted with her future, if she does?  One thing I promise

you: if such joy ever comes to me, I will know how to meet

it gently, thankfully, tenderly, please God.  Good night,

little women.  I hope you are sleeping well----''



He turned and went down the hill, entered the cabin

and took from the other box a mass of Parma violets. 

He put these in the pink bowl and placed it on the table

beside the Girl's bed.  He stood for a time, and then

began pulling single flowers from the bowl and dropping

them over the pillow and snowy spread.



``God, how I love her!'' he whispered softly.



At last he went out and closed the door.  He was

tired and soon fell asleep with the night breeze stirring

his hair, and the glamour of moonlight flooding the lake

touched his face.  Clearly it etched the strong, manly

features, the fine brow and chin, and painted in unusual

tenderness the soft lines around the mouth.  The little

owl wavered its love story, a few frogs were piping, and

the Harvester lay breathing the perfumed spring air

deeply and evenly.  Near midnight Belshazzar awakened

him by arising from the bedside and walking to the door.



``What is it, Bel?'' inquired the Harvester.



The dog whined softly.  The man turned his head

toward the lake.  A ray of red light touched the opposite

embankment and came wavering across the surface. 

The Harvester sat up.  Two big, flaming eyes were

creeping up the levee.



``That,'' said the Harvester, ``might be Doc coming

for me to help him try out my bottled sunshine, or it

might be my bluebird.''



He tossed back the cover, swung his feet to the floor,

setting each in a slipper beside the bed, and arose, dressing

as he started for the door.  As he opened the screen and

stepped on the veranda a passenger car from the city

stopped, and the Harvester went down the walk to

meet it.  His heart turned over when he saw a woman's

hand on the door.



``Permit me,'' he said, taking the handle and bringing

it back with a sweep.  A tall form arose, bent forward,

and descended to the step.  The full flare of moonlight

fell on the glowing face of the Girl.



``Harvester, is it you?'' she asked.



``Yes,'' gasped the man.



Two hands came fluttering out, and he just had presence

of mind to step in range so that they rested on his

shoulders.



``Has the bluebird come?''



``Not yet!''



``Then I am not too late?''



``Never too late to come to me, Ruth.''



``I am welcome?''



``I have no words to tell you how welcome.''



She swayed forward and the Harvester tried to reach

her lips, but they brushed his cheek and touched his ear.



``I have brought one more kiss I want to try,'' she

whispered.



The Harvester crushed her in his arms until he frightened

himself for fear he had hurt her, and murmured

an ecstasy of indistinct love words to her.  Presently her

feet touched the ground and she drew away from him.



``Harvester,'' she whispered, ``I couldn't wait any

longer; indeed I could not: and I couldn't leave grandfather

and grandmother, and I didn't know what in the

world to do, so I just brought them along.  Are they

welcome?''



``Aside from you, I would rather have them than

any people on earth,'' said the Harvester.



There were two sounds in the car; one was an

approving murmur, and the other an undeniable snort. 

The Harvester felt the reassuring pressure of the Girl's

hand.



``Please, Ruth,'' he said, ``go turn on the light so that

I can see to help grandmother.''



A foot stamped before the front seat.  ``Madam

Herron, if you please!'' cried an acrid voice.



`` `Madam Herron,' '' said the Harvester gently, as he

set a foot on the step, reached in and bodily picked up a

little old lady and started up the walk with her in his arms.



``Careful there, sir!'' roared a voice after him.



The Harvester could feel the quake of the laughing

woman and he smiled broadly as he entered the cabin,

and placed her in a large chair before the fire.  Then

he wheeled and ran back to the car, reaching it as the man

was making an effort to descend.  It could be seen

that he had been tall, before time and sorrow had bent

him, and keen eyes gleamed below shaggy white brows

from under his hat brim.  He had a white moustache, and

his hair was snowy.



``Allow me,'' said the Harvester reaching a hand.



``If you touch me I will cane you,'' said Mr. Alexander

Herron.



There was nothing to do but step back.  The cane,

wheel, and a long coat skirt interfering, the old man fell

headlong, and only quick hands saved him a severe jolt

and bruises.  He stood glaring in the moonlight while

his hat was restored.



``If you run your car to the curve you can back toward

the south and turn easily,'' said the Harvester to the

driver.  As the automobile passed them he offered his

arm.  ``May I show you to the fire?  These spring nights

are chilly.''



`` `Chilly!'  Demnition cold is what they are!  I'm

frozen to the bone!  This will be the end of us both! 

Dragging people of our age around at this hour of night. 

Of all the accursed stubbornness!''



``There are three low steps,'' said the Harvester, ``now

a straight stretch of walk, now two steps; there you are

on the level.  Here is an easy chair.  It would be better

to leave on your coat, until I light the fire.''



He knelt and scratched a match, and almost instantly

a flame sprang from the heap of dry kindling, and began

to wrap around the big logs.



``How pretty!'' exclaimed a soft voice.



``Kind of a hunting lodge in the wilds, is it?'' growled

a rough one.  ``Marcella, you will take your death

here!''



``I'm sure I feel no exposure.  Really, Alexander,

if I had passed away every time you have prophesied

that I would in the past twenty years you'd have the

largest private cemetery in existence.  If you would not

be so pessimistic I could quite enjoy the trip.  It's so

long since I've ridden in the cars.''



``Of all the abandoned places!  And for you to be

here, after your years in bed!''



``But I'm not nearly so tired as I am at home,

Alexander, truly.''



``Let me help you, grandfather,'' offered the Girl.



She went to him and took his hat and stick.



``Leave me my cane,'' he cried.  ``Any instant that

beast may attack some of us.''



The Girl laughed merrily.



``Why grandfather!'' she chided, ``Bel is the finest

dog you ever knew, he is my best friend here.  By the

hour he has protected me, and he is gentle as a kitten. 

He's crazy over my coming home.''



She knelt on the floor, put her arms around the dog's

neck, and the delighted brute quivered with the joy of

her caress and the sound of her loved voice.



``Ruthie!'' cautioned the gentle lady. 



``Put that cur out of doors, where animals belong,''

roared the old man, lifting his stick.



``Careful!'' warned the grave voice of the Harvester.



``I thought you said he was gentle as a kitten!''



``Grandfather, I said that,'' cried the Girl.



``Well wasn't it the truth?''



``You can see how he loves me.  Didn't I ever tell

you that Bel made the first friendly overture I ever

received in this part of the country?  He's watched me

by the day, even while I slept.''



``Then what's all this infernal fuss about?''



``Try striking him if you want to find out,'' explained

the Harvester gently.  ``You see, Belshazzar and I are

accustomed to living here alone and very quietly.  He

is excited over the Girl's return, because she is his friend,

and he has not forgotten her.  Then this is the first time

in his life he ever heard an irritable voice from a visitor

or saw a cane, and it angers him.  He is perfectly safe

to guard a baby, if he is gently treated, but he is a sure

throat hold to a stranger who bespeaks him roughly or

attempts to strike.  He would be of no use as a guard

to valuable property while I sleep if he were otherwise. 

Bel, come here!  Lie still.''



The dog sank to the floor beside the Harvester, but his

sharp eyes followed the Girl, and the hair arose on his

neck at every rasping note of the old man's voice.



``I wouldn't give such a creature house room for a

minute,'' insisted the guest.



``Wait until you see him work and become acquainted

with him, and you will change that verdict,'' prophesied

the Harvester.



``I never was known to change an opinion.  Never,

sir!  Never!'' cried the testy voice.



``How unfortunate!'' remarked the Harvester suavely.



``Explain yourself!  Explain yourself, sir!''



``There never has been, there never will be, a man

on this earth,'' said the Harvester, ``wholly free from

mistakes.  Are you warm now?''  He turned to the

little lady, cutting off a reply with his question.



``Nice and warm and quite sleepy,'' she said.



``What may I bring you for a light lunch before you

go to bed?''



``Oh, could I have a bite of something?''



``If only I am fortunate enough to have anything you

will care for.  What about a bowl of hot milk and a

slice of toast?''



``Why I think that would be just the thing!''



``Excuse me,'' said the Harvester rising.



He went to the kitchen and they could hear him

moving around.



``I wish the big brute would take his beast along,''

growled Mr. Alexander Herron.



``Come, Bel,'' ordered the Girl.  ``Let's go to the

kitchen.''



The dog instantly arose and followed her.



``What can I do to help?'' she asked as they reached

the door.



``Remain where you won't dazzle my eyes,'' said the

Harvester, ``until I help the gentle lady and the gentle

man to bed.''



Presently he came with a white cloth, two spoons, and

a plate of bread.  He spread the cloth on the table, laid

the spoons on it, and opening the little cupboard, took

out a long toasting fork, and sticking it into a slice of

bread, he held it over the coals.  When it grew golden

brown he lifted the table beside the chair, and brought

a bowl of scalded milk.



``Marcella, that stuff will be too smoky for you! 

Your stomach will rebel at it.''



``Grandfather, there will not be a suspicion of odour,''

said the Girl.  ``I have had it that way often.''



``Then no wonder you came from this place looking

like a picked crane, if that is a sample of what you were

fed on!''



The face of the Harvester grew redder than the heat

of the fire necessitated, but at the ringing laugh of the

Girl he set his teeth and went on toasting bread.  Grandmother

crumbled some in the milk and picking up the

spoon tested the combination.  She was very hungry,

and it was good.  She began eating with relish.



``Alexander, you will be the loser if you don't have

some of this,'' she said.  ``It's just delicious!''



``Maybe smoked spoon victuals are proper for invalid

women,'' he retorted, ``but they are mighty thin diet

for a hardy man.''



``What about a couple of eggs and some beef extract?''

suggested the cook.



``Sounds more sensible by a long shot.''



``Ruth, you make this toast,'' said the Harvester and

disappeared.



Presently he placed before his guest a couple of eggs

poached in milk, a steaming bowl of beef juice, and a

plate of toast.  For one instant the Harvester thought

this was going into the fire, the next a slice was picked

up and smelled testily.  The Girl sat on her grandfather's

chair arm, and breaking a morsel of toast dipped it into

the broth and tasted it.



``Oh but that is good!'' she cried.  ``Why haven't

I some also?  Am I supposed to have no `tummy'?''



``Your turn next,'' said the Harvester, as he again gave

her the fork and went to the kitchen.



When he returned and served the Girl he found her

grandfather eating heartily.



``Why I think this is fun,'' said the gentle lady.  ``I

haven't had such a fine time in ages.  I love the heat of

the flame on my body and things taste so good.  I could

go to sleep without any narcotic, right now.''



Close her knee the Harvester knelt on the hearth with

his toasting fork.  She leaned forward and ran her fingers

through his hair.



``You're a braw laddie,'' she said.  ``Now I see why

Ruthie WOULD come.''



The Harvester took the frail hand and kissed it. 

``Thank you!'' he returned.



``Mush!'' exploded the grizzled man in the rear.



When no one wanted more food the Harvester stacked

and carried away the dishes, swept the hearth, and

replaced the toaster.



``Ruth and I often lunched this way last fall,'' he said. 

``We liked it for a change.''



``Alexander, have you noticed?'' asked the little

woman as she lifted wet eyes to a beautiful portrait of

her daughter beside the chimney.



``D'ye think I'm blind?  Saw it as I entered the door. 

Poor taste!  Very!  Brown may match the rug and

wood-work, but it's a wretched colour for a young girl

in her gay time.  Should be pink and white with a gold

frame.''



``That would be beautiful,'' agreed the Harvester. 

``We must have one that way.  This is not an expensive

picture.  It is only an enlargement from an old

photograph.''



``We have a number of very handsome likenesses. 

Which one can you spare Ruth, Marcella?''



``The one she likes best,'' said the lady promptly.



``And the other is your mother, no doubt.  What a

girlish, beautiful face!''



``Wonderfully fine!'' growled a gruff old voice

tinctured with tears, and the Harvester began to see light.



The old man arose.  ``Ruthie, help your grandmother

to bed,'' he said.  ``And you, sir, have the goodness to

walk a few steps with me.''



The Harvester sprang up and brought Mr. Herron his

coat and hat and held the door.  The Girl brushed past

him.



``To the oak,'' she whispered.



They went into the night, and without a word the

Harvester took his guest's arm and guided him up the

hill.  When they reached the two mounds the moon

shining between the branches touched the lily faces with

with holy whiteness.



``She sleeps there,'' said the Harvester, indicating the

place.



Then he turned and went down the path a little

distance and waited until he feared the night air would

chill the broken old man.



``You can see better to-morrow,'' he said as he touched

the shaking figure and assisted it to arise.



``Your work?'' Mr. Alexander Herron touched the

lilies with his walking stick.



The Harvester assented.



``Do you mind if I carry one to Marcella?''



The Harvester trembled as he stooped to select the

largest and whitest, and with sudden illumination, he

fully understood.  He helped the tottering old man to

the cabin, where he sat silently before the fireplace

softly touching the lily face with his lips.



``I have put grandmother in my bed, tucked her in

warmly, and she says it is soft and fine,'' laughed the

Girl, coming to them.  ``Now you go before she falls

asleep, and I hope you will rest well.''



She bent and kissed him.



The Harvester held the door.



``Can I be of any service?'' he inquired.



``No, I'm no helpless child.''



``Then to my best wishes for sound sleep the remainder

of the night, I will add this,'' said the Harvester----

``You may rest in peace concerning your dear girl.  I

sympathize with your anxiety.  Good night!''



Alexander Herron threw out his hands in protest.



``I wouldn't mind admitting that you are a gentleman

in a month or two,'' he said, ``but it's a demnation

humiliation to have it literally wrung from me

to-night!''



He banged the door in the face of the amazed

Harvester, who turned to the Girl as she leaned against the

mantel.  He stood absorbing the glowing picture of

beauty and health that she made.  She had removed her

travelling dress and shoes, and was draped in a fleecy

white wool kimono and wearing night slippers.  Her hair

hung in two big braids as it had during her illness.  She

was his sick girl again in costume, but radiant health

glowed on her lovely face.  The Harvester touched a

match to a few candles and turned out the acetylene

lights.  Then he stood before her.



``Now, bluebird,'' he said gently.  ``Ruth, you always

know where to find me, if you will look at your feet. 

I thought I loved you all in my power when you went,

but absence has taught its lessons.  One is that I can

grow to love you more every day I live, and the other

that I probably trifled with the highest gift you had to

offer, when I sent you away.  I may have been right;

Granny and Doc think I was wrong.  You know the 

answer.  You said there was another kiss for me.  Ruth,

is it the same or a different one?''



``It is different.  Quite, quite different!''



``And when?''  The Harvester stretched out longing

arms.  The Girl stepped back.



``I don't know,'' she said.  ``I had it when I started,

but I lost it on the way.''



The Harvester staggered under the disappointment.



``Ruth, this has gone far enough that you wouldn't

play with me, merely for the sake of seeing me suffer,

would you?''



``No!'' cried the Girl.  ``No!  I mean it!  I knew

just what I wanted to say when I started; but we had to

take grandmother out of bed.  She wouldn't allow me to

leave her, and I wouldn't stay away from you any

longer.  She fainted when we put her on the car and

grandfather went wild.  He almost killed the porters,

and he raved at me.  He said my mother had ruined

their lives, and now I would be their death.  I got so

frightened I had a nervous chill and I'm so afraid she will

grow worse----''



``You poor child!'' shuddered the Harvester.  ``I

see!  I understand!  What you need is quiet and a

good rest.''



He placed her in a big easy chair and sitting on the

hearth rug he leaned against her knee and said, ``Now

tell me, unless you are so tired that you should go to bed.''



``I couldn't possibly sleep until I have told you,''

said the Girl.



``If you're merciful, cut it short!'' implored the

Harvester.



``I think it begins,'' she said slowly, ``when I went

because you sent me and I didn't want to go.  Of course,

as soon as I saw grandfather and grandmother, heard

them talk, and understood what their lives had been, and

what might have been, why there was only one thing to

do, as I could see it, and that was to compensate their

agony the best I could.  I think I have, David.  I really

think I have made them almost happy.  But I told them

all any one could tell about you in the start, and from the

first grandmother would have been on your side; but you

see how grandfather is, and he was absolutely determined

that I should live with them, in their home, all

their lives.  He thought the best way to accomplish

that would be to separate me from you and marry me

to the son of his partner.



``There are rooms packed with the lovely things they

bought me, David, and everything was as I wrote you. 

Some of the people who came were wonderful, so gracious

and beautiful, I loved almost all of them.  They took

me places where there were pictures, plays, and lovely

parties, and I studied hard to learn some music, to dance,

ride and all the things they wanted me to do, and to read

good books, and to learn to meet people with graciousness

to equal theirs, and all of it.  Every day I grew stronger

and met more people, and there were different places

to go, and always, when anything was to be done, up

popped Mr. Herbert Kennedy and said and did exactly 

the right thing, and he could be extremely nice,

David.''



``I haven't a doubt!'' said the Harvester, laying hold

of her kimono.



``And he popped up so much that at last I saw he was

either pretending or else he really was growing very fond

of me, so one day when we were alone I told him all

about you, to make him see that he must not.  He

laughed at me, and said exactly what you did, that I

didn't love you at all, that it was gratitude, that it was

the affection of a child.  He talked for hours about how

grandfather and grandmother had suffered, how it was my

duty to live with them and give you up, even if I cared

greatly for you; but he said what I felt was not love at all. 

Then he tried to tell me what he thought love was, and I

could see very clearly that if it was like that, I didn't

love you, but I came a whole world closer it than loving

him, and I told him so.  He laughed again and

said I was mistaken, and that he was going to teach

me what real love was, and then I could not be driven

back to you.  After that, everybody and everything

just pushed me toward him with both hands, except

one person.  She was a young married woman and

I met her at the very first.  She was the only real friend

I ever had, and at last, the latter part of February, when

things were the very worst, I told her.  I told her every

single thing.  She was on your side.  She said you were

twice the man Herbert Kennedy was, and as soon as I

found I could talk to her about you, I began going there 

and staying as long as I could, just to talk and to play

with her baby.



``Her husband was a splendid young fellow, and I

grew very fond of him.  I knew she had told him, because

he suddenly began talking to me in the kindest way, and

everything he said seemed to be what I most wanted to

hear.  I got along fairly well until hints of spring began

to come, and then I would wonder about my hedge, and

my gold garden, and if the ice was off the lake, and

about my boat and horse, and I wanted my room, and

oh, David, most of all I wanted you!  Just you!  Not

because you could give me anything to compare in

richness with what they could, not because this home was

the best I'd ever known except theirs, not for any reason

at all only just that I wanted to see your face, hear your

voice, and have you pick me up and take me in your arms

when I was tired.  That was when I almost quit writing. 

I couldn't say what I wanted to, and I wouldn't write

trivial things, so I went on day after day just groping.''



``And you killed me alive,'' said the Harvester.



``I was afraid of that, but I couldn't write.  I just

couldn't!  It was ten days ago that I thought of the

bluebird's coming this year and what it would mean to

you, and THAT killed me, Man!  It just hurt my heart

until it ached, to know that you were out here alone;

and that night I couldn't sleep, because I was thinking

of you, and it came to me that if I had your lips then I

could give you a much, much better kiss than the last,

and when it was light I wrote that line.



``Nearly a week later I got your answer early in the

morning, and it almost drove me wild.  I took it and went

for the day with May, and I told her.  She took me

upstairs, and we talked it over, and before I left she made

me promise that I would write you and explain how I

felt, and ask you what you thought.  She wanted you

to come there and see if you couldn't make them at least

respect you.  I know I was crying, and she was bathing

the baby.  She went to bring something she had forgotten,

and she gave him to me to hold, just his little

naked body.  He stood on my lap and mauled my face,

and pulled my hair, and hugged me with his stout little

arms and kissed me big, soft, wet kisses, and something

sprang to life in my heart that never before had been

there.  I just cried all over him and held him fast, and

I couldn't give him up when she came back.  I saw why

I'd wanted a big doll all my life, right then; and oh,

dear! the doll you sent was beautiful, but, David, did

you ever hold a little, living child in your arms like that?''



``I never did,'' said the Harvester huskily.



He looked at her face and saw the tears rolling, but

he could say no more, so he leaned his head against her

knee, and finding one of her hands he drew it to his lips.



``It is wonderful,'' said the Girl softly.  ``It awakens

something in your heart that makes it all soft and tender,

and you feel an awful responsibility, too.  Grandmother

had them telephone at last, and May helped me bathe

my face and fix my hat.  When we went to the carriage

Mr. Kennedy was there to take me home.  We went

past grandmother's florist to get her some violets----

David, she is sleeping under yours, with just a few

touching her lips.  Oh it was lovely of you to get them; your

fairies must have told you!  She has them every day,

and one of the objections she made to coming here was

that she couldn't do without them in winter, and she

found some on her pillow the very first thing.  David,

you are wonderful!  And grandfather with his lily! 

I know where he found that!  I knew instantly.  Ah,

there are fairies who tell you, because you deserve to

know.''



The Girl bent and slipping her arm around his neck

hugged him tight an instant, and then she continued

unsteadily:  ``While he was in the shop----Harvester,

this is like your wildest dream, but it's truest truth----a

boy came down the walk crying papers, and as I live,

he called your name.  I knew it had to be you because

he said, ``First drug farm in America!  Wonderful

medicine contributed to the cause of science!  David

Langston honoured by National Medical Association!'' 

I just stood in the carriage and screamed, `Boy!  Boy!'

until the coachman thought I had lost my senses.  He

whistled and got me the paper.  I was shaking so I

asked him how to find anything you wanted quickly,

and he pointed the column where events are listed;

and when I found the third page there was your face so

splendidly reproduced, and you seemed so fine and noble

to me I forgot about the dress suit and the badge in

your buttonhole, or to wonder when or how or why it

could have happened.  I just sat there shouting in my

soul, `David!  David!  Medicine Man!  Harvester Man!'

again and again.



``I don't know what I said to Mr. Kennedy or how I

got to my room.  I scanned it by the column, at last

I got to paragraphs, and finally I read all the sentences. 

David, I kissed that newspaper face a hundred times,

and if you could have had those, Man, I think you

would have said they were right.  David, there is

nothing to cry over!''



``I'm not!'' said the Harvester, wiping the splashes

from her hand.  ``But, Ruth, forget what I said about

being brief.  I didn't realize what was coming.  I should

have said, if you've any mercy at all, go slowly!  This is

the greatest thing that ever happened or ever will happen

to me.  See that you don't leave out one word of it.''



``I told you I had to tell you first,'' said the Girl.



``I understand now,'' said the Harvester, his head

against her knee while he pressed her hand to his lips. 

``I see!  Your coming couldn't be perfect without knowing

this first.  Go on, dear heart, and slowly!  You

owe me every word.''



``When I had it all absorbed, I carried the paper to

the library and said, `Grandfather, such a wonderful

thing has happened.  A man has had a new idea, and he

has done a unique work that the whole world is going to

recognize.  He has stood before men and made a speech

that few, oh so few, could make honestly, and he has

advocated right living, oh so nobly, and he has given

a wonderful gift to science without price, because through

it he first saved the life he loved best.  Isn't that

marvellous, grandfather?'  And he said, `Very marvellous,

Ruth.  Won't you sit down and read to me about it?' 

And I said, `I can't, dear grandfather, because I have

been away from grandmother all day, and she is fretting

for me, and to-night is a great ball, and she has spent

millions on my dress, I think, and there is an especial

reason why I must go, and so I have to see her now; but

I want to show you the man's face, and then you can

read the story.'



``You see, I knew if I started to read it he would stop

me; but if I left him alone with it he would be so curious

he would finish.  So I turned your name under and

held the paper and said, `What do you think of that

face, grandfather?  Study it carefully,' and, Man, only

guess what he said!  He said, `I think it is the face of

one of nature's noblemen.'  I just kissed him time and

again and then I said, `So it is grandfather, so it is; for it

is the face of the man who twice saved my life, and lifted

my mother from almost a pauper grave and laid her to

rest in state, and the man who found you, and sent

me to you when I was determined not to come.'  And I

just stood and kissed that paper before him and cried,

again and again, `He is one of nature's noblemen, and he

is my husband, my dear, dear husband and to-morrow I

am going home to him.'  Then I laid the paper on his

lap and ran away.  I went to grandmother and did everything

she wanted, then I dressed for the ball.  I went

to say good-bye to her and show my dress and grandfather

was there, and he followed me out and said, `Ruth,

you didn't mean it?' I said, `Did you read the paper,

grandfather?' and he said 'Yes'; and I said, `Then I

should think you would know I mean it, and glory

in my wonderful luck.  Think of a man like that,

grandfather!'



``I went to the ball, and I danced and had a lovely

time with every one, because I knew it was going to be

the very last, and to-morrow I must start to you.



``On the way home I told Mr. Kennedy what paper

to get and to read it.  I said good-bye to him, and I

really think he cared, but I was too happy to be very

sorry.  When I reached my room there was a packet for

me and, Man, like David of old, you are a wonderful

poet!  Oh Harvester! why didn't you send them to me

instead of the cold, hard things you wrote?''



``What do you mean, Ruth?''



``Those letters!  Those wonderful outpourings of love

and passion and poetry and song and broken-heartedness. 

Oh Man, how could you write such things and throw

them in the fire?  Granny Moreland found them when

she came to bring you a pie, and she carried them to

Doctor Carey, and he sent them to me, and, David,

they finished me.  Everything came in a heap.  I would

have come without them, but never, never with quite

the understanding, for as I read them the deeps opened

up, and the flood broke, and there did a warm tide go

through all my being, like you said it would; and now, 

David, I know what you mean by love.  I called the

maids and they packed my trunk and grandmother's,

and I had grandfather's valet pack his, and go and secure

berths and tickets, and learn about trains, and I got

everything ready, even to the ambulance and doctor;

but I waited until morning to tell them.  I knew they

would not let me come alone, so I brought them along. 

David, what in the world are we going to do with them?''



The Harvester drew a deep breath and looked at the

flushed face of the Girl.



``With no time to mature a plan, I would say that we

are going to love them, care for them, gradually teach

them our work, and interest them in our plans here;

and so soon as they become reconciled we will build them

such a house as they want on the hill facing us, just across

Singing Water, and there they may have every luxury

they can provide for themselves, or we can offer, and the

pleasure of your presence, and both of them can grow

strong and happy.  I'll have grandmother on her feet in

ten days, and the edge off grandfather's tongue in three. 

That bluster of his is to drown tears, Ruth; I saw it to-

night.  And when they pass over we will carry them up

and lay them beside her under the oak, and we can take

the house we build for them, if you like it better, and use

this for a store-room.''



``Never!'' said the Girl.  ``Never!  My sunshine

room and gold garden so long as I live.  Never again

will I leave them.  If this cabin grows too small, we will

build all over the hillside; but my room and garden and

this and the dining-room and your den there must remain

as they are now.''



The Harvester arose and drew the davenport before

the fireplace, and heaped pillows.  ``You are so tired you

are trembling, and your voice is quivering,'' he said.  He

lifted the Girl, laid her down and arranged the coverlet.



``Go to sleep!'' he ordered gently.  ``You have made

me so wildly happy that I could run and shout like a

madman.  Try to rest, and maybe the fairies who aid

me will put my kiss back on your lips.  I am going to

the hill top to tell mother and my God.''



He knelt and gathered her in his arms a second, then

called Belshazzar to guard, and went into the sweet

spring night, to jubilate with that wild surge of passion

that sweeps the heart of a strong man when he is most

nearly primal.  He climbed the hill at a rush, and standing

beneath the oak on the summit, he faced the lake,

and stretching his arms widely, he waved them, merely

to satisfy the demand for action.  When urgency for

expression came upon him, he laughed a deep rumble

of exultation.



The night wind swept the lake and lifted his hair,

the odour of spring was intoxicating in his nostrils,

small creatures of earth stirred around him, here and there

a bird, restless in the delirium of mating fever, lifted

its head and piped a few notes on the moon-whitened

air.  The frogs sang uninterruptedly at the water's

edge.  The Harvester stood rejoicing.  Beating on his

brain came a rush of love words uttered in the Girl's

dear voice.  ``I wanted you!  Just you!  He is my husband! 

My dear, dear husband!  To-morrow I am going

home!  Now, David, I know what you mean by love!'' 

The Harvester laughed again and sounds around him

ceased for a second, then swelled in fuller volume than

before.  He added his voice.  ``Thank God!  Oh, thank

God!'' he cried.  ``And may the Author of the Universe,

the spirits of the little mothers who loved us, and all the

good fairies who guide us, unite to bring unbounded joy

to my Dream Girl and to guard her safely.''



The cocks of Medicine Woods began their second

salute to dawn.  At this sound and with the mention of

her name, the Harvester turned down the hill, and striding

forcefully approached the cabin.  As he passed the

Girl's room he stepped softly, smiling as he wondered if

its unexpected occupants were resting.  He followed

Singing Water, and stood looking at the hillside, studying

the exact location most suitable for a home for the old

people he was so delighted to welcome.  That they would

remain he never doubted.  His faith in the call of the

wild had been verified in the Girl; it would reach them

also.  The hill top would bind them.  Their love for the

Girl would compel them.  They would be company for

her and a new interest in life.



``Couldn't be better, not possibly!'' commented the

delighted Harvester.



He followed the path down Singing Water until he

reached the bridge where it turned into the marsh. 

There he paused, looking straight ahead.



``Wonder if I would frighten her?'' he mused.  ``I

believe I'll risk it.''



He walked on rapidly, vaulted the fence enclosing

his land, crossed the road, and unlatched the gate.  As

he did so, the door opened, and Granny Moreland stood

on the sill, waiting with keen eyes.



``Well I don't need neither specs nor noonday sun

to see that you're steppin' like the blue ribbon colt at

the County Fair, and lookin' like you owned Kingdom

Come,'' she said.  ``What's up, David?''



``You are right, dear,'' said the Harvester.  ``I have

entered my kingdom.  The Girl has come and crowned

me with her love.  She had decided to return, but the

letters you sent made her happier about it.  I wanted

you to know.''



Granny leaned against the casing, and began to sob

unrestrainedly.



The Harvester supported her tenderly.



``Why don't do that, dear.  Don't cry,'' he begged. 

``The Girl is home for always, Granny, and I'm so happy

I am out to-night trying to keep from losing my mind

with joy.  She will come to you to-morrow, I know.''



Granny tremulously dried her eyes.



``What an old sap-head I am!'' she commented.  ``I

stole your letters from your fireplace, pitched a willer

plate into the lake----you got to fish that out, come day,

David----fooled you into that trip to Doc Carey to get

him to mail them to Ruth, and never turned a hair. 

But after I got home I commenced thinkin' 'twas a pretty

ticklish job to stick your nose into other people's business,

an' every hour it got worse, until I ain't had a fairly

decent sleep since.  If you hadn't come soon, boy, I'd

'a' been sick a-bed.  Oh, David!  Are you sure she's over

there, and loves you to suit you now?''



``Yes dear, I am absolutely certain,'' said the

Harvester.  ``She was so determined to come that she

brought the invalid grandmother she couldn't leave and

her grandfather.  They arrived at midnight.  We are all

going to live together now.''



``Well bless my stars!  Fetched you a family!  David,

I do hope to all that's peaceful I hain't put my foot in it. 

The moon is the deceivingest thing on earth I know,

but does her family 'pear to be an a-gre'-able family,

by its light?''



The Harvester's laugh boomed a half mile down the

road.



``Finest people on earth, next to you, dear.  I'm

mighty glad to have them.  I'm going to build them a

house on my best location, and we are all going to be

happy from now on.  Go to bed!  This night air may

chill you.  I can't sleep.  I wanted you to know first----

so I came over.  In mother's stead, will you kiss me, and

wish me happiness, dear friend?''



Granny Moreland laid an eager, withered hand on

each shoulder, and bent to the radiant young face.



``God bless you, lad, and grant you as great happiness

as life ort to fetch every clean, honest man,'' she prayed

fervently, with closed eyes and her lined old face turned

skyward.  ``And, O God, bless Ruth, and help her as

You never helped mortal woman before to know her own

mind without `variableness, neither shadow of turnin'.' ''



The Harvester was on Singing Water bridge before he

gave way.  There he laughed as never before in his life. 

Finally he controlled himself and started toward the

cabin; but he was chuckling as he passed the driveway,

and walked down the broad cement floor leading to his

bathing pool, where the moonlight bridged the lake,

and fell as a benediction all around him.



He stood a long time, when he recognized the familiar

crash of a breaking backlog falling together, and heard

the customary leap of the frightened dog.  He walked

to his door and listened intently, but there was no sound;

so he decided the Girl had not been awakened.  In the

midst of a whitening sheet of gold the Harvester dropped

to his stoop and leaned his head against the broad casing. 

He broke a twig from a hawthorn bush beside him, and

sat twisting it in his fingers as he stared down the line

of the gold bridge.  Never had it seemed so material,

so like a path that might be trodden by mortal feet and

lead them straight to Heaven.  As on the hill top, night

again surrounded him and the Harvester's soul drank

deep wild draughts of a new joy.  Sleep was out of

the question.  He was too intensely alive to know that

he ever again could be weary.  He sat there in the moonlight,

and with unbridled heart gloried in the joy that

had come to him.



He turned his face from the bridge as he heard the 

click of Belshazzar's nails on the floor of the bathing

pool.  Then his heart and breath stopped an instant. 

Beside the dog walked the Girl, one hand on his head

the other holding the flowing white robe around her and

grasping one of the Harvester's lilies.  His first thought

was sheer amazement that she was not afraid, for it was

evident now that the backlog had awakened her, and

she had taken the dog and gone to her mother.  Then

she had followed the path leading down the hill, around

the cabin, and into the sheet of moonlight gilding the

shore.  She stood there gazing over the lake, oblivious

to all things save the entrancing allurement of a perfect

spring night beside undulant water.  Screened from her

with bushes and trees the Harvester scarcely breathed

lest he startle her.  Then his head swam, and his still

heart leaped wildly.  She was coming toward him.  On

her left lay the path to the hill top.  A few steps farther

she could turn to the right and follow the driveway to

the front of the cabin.  He leaned forward watching in

an agony of suspense.  Her beautiful face was transfigured

with joy, aflame with love, radiant with smiles,

and her tall figure fleecy white, rimmed in gold.  Up

the shining path of light she steadily advanced toward

his door.  Then the Harvester understood, and from

his exultant heart burst the wordless petition:



``LORD GOD ALMIGHTY, HELP ME TO BE A MAN!''



With outstretched arms he arose to meet her.



``My Dream Girl!'' he cried hoarsely.  ``My Dream

Girl!''



``Coming, Harvester!'' she answered in tones of joy,

as she dropped the white flower and lifted her hands to

draw his face toward her.



``Is that the kiss you wanted?'' she questioned.



``Yes, Ruth,'' breathed the Harvester.



``Then I am ready to be your wife,'' she said.  ``May

I share all the remainder of life's joys and sorrows with

you?''



The Harvester gathered her in his arms and carried

her to the bench on the lake shore.  He wrapped the white

robe around her and clasped her tenderly as behooved a

lover, yet with arms that she knew could have crushed

her had they willed.  The minutes slipped away, and still

he held her to his heart, the reality far surpassing his

dream; for he knew that he was awake, and he realized

this as the supreme hour that comes to the strongman

who knows his love requited.



When the first banner of red light arose above Medicine

Woods and Singing Water the cocks on the hillside

announced the dawn.  As the gold faded to gray,

a burst of bubbling notes swelled from a branch almost

over their heads where stood a bark-enclosed little house.



``Ruth, do you hear that?'' asked the Harvester softly.



``Yes,'' she answered, ``and I see it.  A wonderful

bird, with Heaven's deepest blue on its back and a breast

like a russet autumn leaf, came straight up the lake from

the south, and before it touched the limb that song

seemed to gush from its throat.''



``And for that reason, the greatest nature lover who

ever lived says that it `deserves preeminence.'  It always

settles from its long voyage through the air in an ecstasy

of melody.  Do you know what it is, Ruth?''



The Girl laid a hand on his cheek and turned his eyes

from the bird to her face as she answered, ``Yes, Harvester-

man, I know.  It is your first bluebird----but it

is far too late, and Belshazzar has lost high office. 

I have usurped both their positions.  You remain in the

woods and reap their harvest, you enter the laboratory

and make wonderful, life-giving medicines, you face the

world and tell men of the high and holy life they may

live if they will, and then----always and forever, you

come back to Medicine Woods and to me, Harvester.''











THE END
