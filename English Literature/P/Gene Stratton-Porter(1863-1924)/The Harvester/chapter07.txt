THE QUEST OF THE DREAM GIRL



The Harvester breakfasted, fed the stock, hitched

Betsy to the spring wagon, and went into the

dripping, steamy woods.  If anyone had asked

him that morning concerning his idea of Heaven, he

never would have dreamed of describing a place of gold-

paved streets, crystal pillars, jewelled gates, and thrones

of ivory.  These things were beyond the man's comprehension

and he would not have admired or felt at home

in such magnificence if it had been materialized for him. 

He would have told you that a floor of last year's brown

leaves, studded with myriad flower faces, big, bark-

encased pillars of a thousand years, jewels on every

bush, shrub, and tree, and tilting thrones on which

gaudy birds almost burst themselves to voice the joy

of life, while their bright-eyed little mates peered

questioningly at him over nest rims----he would have told you

that Medicine Woods on a damp, sunny May morning

was Heaven.  And he would have added that only

one angel, tall and slender, with the pink of health

on her cheeks and the dew of happiness in her dark

eyes, was necessary to enter and establish glory.

Everything spoke to him that morning, but the Harvester

was silent.  It had been his habit to talk constantly

to Belshazzar, Ajax, his work, even the winds and perfumes;

it had been his method of dissipating solitude,

but to-day he had no words, even for these dear friends. 

He only opened his soul to beauty, and steadily climbed

the hill to the crest, and then down the other side to the

rich, half-shaded, half-open spaces, where big, rough

mushrooms sprang in a night similar to the one just

passed.



He could see them awaiting him from afar.  He began

work with rapid fingers, being careful to break off the

heads, but not to pull up the roots.  When four heaping

baskets were filled he cut heavily leaved branches to

spread over them, and started to Onabasha.  As usual,

Belshazzar rode beside him and questioned the Harvester

when he politely suggested to Betsy that she

make a little haste.



``Have you forgotten that mushrooms are perishable?''

he asked.  ``If we don't get these to the city all woodsy

and fresh we can't sell them.  Wonder where we can

do the best?  The hotels pay well.  Really, the biggest

prices could be had by----''



Then the Harvester threw back his head and began

to laugh, and he laughed, and he laughed.  A crow on

the fence Joined him, and a kingfisher, heading for Loon

Lake, and then Belshazzar caught the infection.



``Begorry!  The very idea!'' cried the Harvester. 

`` `Heaven helps them that help themselves.'  Now you

just watch us manoeuvre for assistance, Belshazzar, old

boy!  Here we go!''



Then the laugh began again.  It continued all the

way to Onabasha and even into the city.  The Harvester

drove through the most prosperous street until he reached

the residence district.  At the first home he stopped,

gave the lines to Belshazzar, and, taking a basket of

mushrooms, went up the walk and rang the bell.



``All groceries should be delivered at the back door,''

snapped a pert maid, before he had time to say a word.



The Harvester lifted his hat.



``Will you kindly tell the lady of the house that I

wish to speak with her?''



``What name, please?''



``I want to show her some fine mushrooms, freshly

gathered,'' he answered.



How she did it the Harvester never knew.  The

first thing he realized was that the door had closed

before his face, and the basket had been picked deftly

from his fingers and was on the other side.  After a

short time the maid returned.



``What do you want for them, please?''



The last thing on earth the Harvester wanted to do

was to part with those mushrooms, so he took one long,

speculative look down the hall and named a price he

thought would be prohibitive.



``One dollar a dozen.''



``How many are there?''



``I count them as I sell them.  I do not know.''



The door closed again.  Presently it opened and the

maid knelt on the floor before him and counted the

mushrooms one by one into a dish pan and in a few minutes

brought back seven dollars and fifty cents.  The

chagrined Harvester, feeling like a thief, put the money

in his pocket, and turned away.



``I was to tell you,'' said she, ``that you are to bring

all you have to sell here, and the next time please go

to the kitchen door.''



``Must be fond of mushrooms,'' said the disgruntled

Harvester.



``They are a great delicacy, and there are visitors.'' 

The Harvester ached to set the girl to one side and

walk through the house, but he did not dare; so he

returned to the street, whistled to Betsy to come, and went

to the next gate.  Here he hesitated.  Should he risk

further snubbing at the front door or go back at once. 

If he did, he only would see a maid.  As he stood an

instant debating, the door of the house he just had

left opened and the girl ran after him.  ``If you have

more, we will take them,'' she called.



The Harvester gasped for breath.



``They have to be used at once,'' he suggested.



``She knows that.  She wants to treat her friends.''



``Well she has got enough for a banquet,'' he said. 

``I--I don't usually sell more than a dozen or two in

one place.''



``I don't see why you can't let her have them if you

have more.''



``Perhaps I have orders to fill for regular customers,''

suggested the Harvester.



``And perhaps you haven't,'' said the maid.  ``You

ought to be ashamed not to let people who are willing

to pay your outrageous prices have them.  It's regular

highway robbery.''



``Possibly that's the reason I decline to hold up one

party twice,'' said the Harvester as he entered the gate

and went up the walk to the front door.



``You should be taught your place,'' called the maid

after him.



The Harvester again rang the bell.  Another maid

opened the door, and once more he asked to speak with

the lady of the house.  As the girl turned, a handsome

old woman in cap and morning gown came down the

stairs.



``What have you there?'' she asked.



The Harvester lifted the leaves and exposed the

musky, crimpled, big mushrooms.



``Oh!'' she cried in delight.  ``Indeed, yes!  We are

very fond of them.  I will take the basket, and divide

with my sons.  You are sure you have no poisonous

ones among them?''



``Quite sure,'' said the Harvester faintly.



``How much do you want for the basket?''



``They are a dollar a dozen; I haven't counted them.''



``Dear me!  Isn't that rather expensive?''



``It is.  Very!'' said the Harvester.  ``So expensive

that most people don't think of taking over a dozen. 

They are large and very rich, so they go a long

way.''



``I suppose you have to spend a great deal of time

hunting them?  It does seem expensive, but they are

fresh, and the boys are so fond of them.  I'm not often

extravagant, I'll just take the lot.  Sarah, bring a pan.''



Again the Harvester stood and watched an entire

basket counted over and carried away, and he felt the

robber he had been called as he took the money.



At the next house he had learned a lesson.  He carpeted

a basket with leaves and counted out a dozen and a

half into it, leaving the remainder in the wagon.  Three

blocks on one side of the street exhausted his store and

he was showered with orders.  He had not seen any

one that even resembled a dark-eyed girl.  As he came

from the last house a big, red motor shot past and then

suddenly slowed and backed beside his wagon.



``What in the name of sense are you doing?'' demanded

Doctor Carey.



``Invading the residence district of Onabasha,'' said

the Harvester.  ``Madam, would you like some nice,

fresh, country mushrooms?  I guarantee that there are

no poisonous ones among them, and they were gathered

this morning.  Considering their rarity and the difficult

work of collecting, they are exceedingly low at my price. 

I am offering these for five dollars a dozen, madam,

and for mercy sake don't take them or I'll have no excuse

to go to the next house.''



The doctor stared, then understood, and began to

laugh.  When at last he could speak he said, ``David,

I'll bet you started with three bushels and began at the

head of this street, and they are all gone.''



``Put up a good one!'' said the Harvester.  ``You

win.  The first house I tried they ordered me to the

back door, took a market basket full away from me

by force, tried to buy the load, and I didn't see any

one save a maid.''



The doctor lay on the steering gear and faintly groaned.



The Harvester regarded him sympathetically.  ``Isn't

it a crime?'' he questioned.  ``Mushrooms are no go.

I can see that!----or rather they are entirely too much

of a go.  I never saw anything in such demand.  I

must seek a less popular article for my purpose.  To-

morrow look out for me.  I shall begin where I left off

to-day, but I will have changed my product.''



``David, for pity sake,'' peeped the doctor.



``What do I care how I do it, so I locate her?''

superbly inquired the Harvester.



``But you won't find her!'' gasped the doctor.



``I've come as close it as you so far, anyway,'' said

the Harvester.  ``Your mushrooms are on the desk in

your office.''



He drove slowly up and down the streets until Betsy

wabbled on her legs.  Then he left her to rest and walked

until he wabbled; and by that time it was dark, so he

went home.



At the first hint of dawn he was at work the following

morning.  With loaded baskets closely covered, he



started to Onabasha, and began where he had quit the

day before.  This time he carried a small, crudely

fashioned bark basket, leaf-covered, and he rang at the

front door with confidence.



Every one seemed to have a maid in that part of the

city, for a freshly capped and aproned girl opened the

door.



``Are there any young women living here?'' blandly

inquired the Harvester.



``What's that of your business?'' demanded the

maid.



The Harvester flushed, but continued, ``I am offering

something especially intended for young women.  If

there are none, I will not trouble you.''



``There are several.''



``Will you please ask them if they would care for

bouquets of violets, fresh from the woods?''



``How much are they, and how large are the bunches?''



``Prices differ, and they are the right size to appear

well.  They had better see for themselves.''



The maid reached for the basket, but the Harvester

drew back.



``I keep them in my possession,'' he said.  ``You may

take a sample.''



He lifted the leaves and drew forth a medium-sized

bunch of long-stemmed blue violets with their leaves. 

The flowers were fresh, crisp, and strong odours of the

woods arose from them.



``Oh!'' cried the maid.  ``Oh, how lovely!''



She hurried away with them and returned carrying

a purse.



``I want two more bunches,'' she said.  ``How much

are they?''



``Are the girls who want them dark or fair?''



``What difference does that make?''



``I have blue violets for blondes, yellow for brunettes,

and white for the others.''



``Well I never!  One is fair, and two have brown hair

and blue eyes.''



``One blue and two whites,'' said the Harvester calmly,

as if matching women's hair and eyes with flowers were

an inherited vocation.  ``They are twenty cents a

bunch.''



``Aha!'' he chortled to himself as he whistled to Betsy. 

``At last we have it.  There are no dark-eyed girls here. 

Now we are making headway.''



Down the street he went, with varying fortune, but

with patience and persistence at every house he at last

managed to learn whether there was a dark-eyed girl. 

There did not seem to be many.  Long before his store

of yellow violets was gone the last blue and white had

disappeared.  But he calmly went on asking for dark-

eyed girls, and explaining that all the blue and white

were taken, because fair women were most numerous.



At one house the owner, who reminded the Harvester

of his mother, came to the door.  He uncovered and in

his suavest tones inquired if a brunette young woman lived

there and if she would like a nosegay of yellow violets.



``Well bless my soul!'' cried she.  ``What is this

world coming to?  Do you mean to tell me that there

are now able-bodied men offering at our doors, flowers

to match our girls' complexions?''



``Yes madam?'' said the Harvester gravely, ``and

also selling them as fast as he can show them, at prices

that make a profit very well worth while.  I had an

equal number of blue and white, but I see the dark

girls are very much in the minority.  The others were

gone long ago, and I now have flowers to offer brunettes

only.''



``Well forever more!  And you don't call that fiddlin'

business for a big, healthy, young man?''



The Harvester's gay laugh was infectious.



``I do not,'' he said.  ``I have to start as soon as I

can see, tramp long distances in wet woods and gather

the violets on my knees, make them into bunches, and

bring them here in water to keep them fresh.  I have

another occupation.  I only kill time on these, but I would

be ashamed to tell you what I have gotten for them this

morning.''



``Humph!  I'm glad to hear it!'' said the woman. 

``Shame in some form is a sign of grace.  I have no use

for a human being without a generous supply of it. 

There is a very beautiful dark-eyed girl in the house,

and I will take two bunches for her.  How much are

they?''



``I have only three remaining,'' said the Harvester. 

``Would you like to allow her to make her own selection?''



``When I'm giving things I usually take my choice.  I

want that, and that one.''



``As my stock is so nearly out, I'll make the two for

twenty,'' said the Harvester.  ``Won't you accept the

last one from me, because you remind me just a little

of my mother?''



``I will indeed,'' said she.  ``Thank you very much! 

I shall love to have them as dearly as any of the girls. 

I used to gather them when I was a child, but I almost

never see the blue ones any more, and I don't know as

I ever expected to see a yellow violet again as long as I

live.  Where did you get them?''



``In my woods,'' said the Harvester.  ``You see I

grow several members of the viola pedata family, bird's

foot, snake, and wood violet, and three of the odorata,

English, marsh, and sweet, for our big drug houses. 

They use the flowers in making delicate tests for acids

and alkalies.  The entire plant, flower, seed, leaf, and

root, goes into different remedies.  The beds seed

themselves and spread, so I have more than I need for the

chemists, and I sell a few.  I don't use the white and

yellow in my business; I just grow them for their beauty. 

I also sell my surplus lilies of the valley.  Would you

like to order some of them for your house or more

violets for to-morrow?''



``Well bless my soul!  Do you mean to tell me that

lilies of the valley are medicine?''



The Harvester laughed.



``I grow immense beds of them in the woods on the

banks of Loon Lake,'' he said.  ``They are the convallaris

majallis of the drug houses and I scarcely know what

the weak-hearted people would do without them.  I

use large quantities in trade, and this season I am selling

a few because people so love them.''



``Lilies in medicine; well dear me!  Are roses good

for our innards too?''



Then the Harvester did laugh.



``I imagine the roses you know go into perfumes

mostly,'' he answered.  ``They do make medicine of

Canadian rock rose and rose bay, laurel, and willow. 

I grow the bushes, but they are not what you would

consider roses.''



``I wonder now,'' said the woman studying the

Harvester closely, ``if you are not that queer genius I've

heard of, who spends his time hunting and growing

stuff in the woods and people call him the Medicine

Man.''



``I strongly suspect madam, I am that man,'' said

the Harvester.



``Well bless me!'' cried she.  ``I've always wanted to

see you and here when I do, you look just like anybody

else.  I thought you'd have long hair, and be wild-

eyed and ferocious.  And your talk sounds like out of

a book.  Well that beats me!''



``Me too!'' said the Harvester, lifting his hat.  ``You

don't want any lilies to-morrow, then?''



``Yes I do.  Medicine or no medicine, I've always

liked 'em, and I'm going to keep on liking them.  If

you can bring me a good-sized bunch after the weak-

kneed----''



``Weak-hearted,'' corrected the Harvester.



``Well `weak-hearted,' then; it's all the same thing. 

If you've got any left, as I was saying, you can fetch

them to me for the smell.''



The Harvester laughed all the way down town.  There

he went to Doctor Carey's office, examined a directory,

and got the names of all the numbers where be had sold

yellow violets.  A few questions when the doctor came

in settled all of them, but the flower scheme was

better.  Because the yellow were not so plentiful as the

white and blue, next day he added buttercups and cowslips

to his store for the dark girls.  When he had rifled

his beds for the last time, after three weeks of almost

daily trips to town, and had paid high prices to small

boys he set searching the adjoining woods until no more

flowers could be found, he drove from the outskirts of

the city one day toward the hospital, and as he stopped,

down the street came Doctor Carey frantically waving

to him.  As the big car slackened, ``Come on David,

quick!  I've seen her!'' cried the doctor.



The Harvester jumped from the wagon, threw the

lines to Belshazzar, and landed in the panting car.



``For Heaven's sake where?  Are you sure?''



The car went speeding down the street.  A policeman

beckoned and cried after it.



``It won't do any good to get arrested, Doc,'' cautioned

the Harvester.



``Now right along here,'' panted Doctor Carey.  ``Watch

both sides sharply.  If I stop you jump out, and tell the

blame policemen to get at their job.  The party they

are hired to find is right under their noses.''



The Harvester began to perspire.  ``Doc, don't you

think you should tell me?  Maybe she is in some store. 

Maybe I could do better on foot.''



``Shut up!'' growled the doctor.  ``I am doing the

best I know.''



He hurried up the street for blocks and back again,

and at last stopped before a large store and went in. 

When he returned he drove to the hospital and together

they entered the office.  There he turned to the

Harvester.



``It isn't so hard to understand you now, my boy,''

he said.  ``Shades of Diana, but she'll be a beauty when

she gets a little more flesh and colour.  She came out

of Whitlaw's and walked right to the crossing.  I almost

could have touched her, but I didn't notice.  Two girls

passed before me, and in hurrying, a tall, dark one knocked

off one of your bunches of yellow violets.  She glanced

at it and laughed, but let it lay.  Then your girl hesitated

stooped and picked it up.  The crazy policeman yelled

at me to clear the crossing and it didn't hit me for a

half block how tall and white she was and how dark

her eyes were.  I was just thinking about her picking

up the flowers, and that it was queer for her to do it,

when like a brick it hit me, THAT'S DAVID'S GIRL!  I tried

to turn around, but you know what Main Street is in

the middle of the day.  And those idiots of policemen! 

They ordered me on, and I couldn't turn for a street car

coming, so I called to one of them that the girl we wanted

was down the street, and he looked at me like an addle-

pate and said, `What girl?  Move on or you'll get

in a jam here.'  You can use me for a football if I

don't go back and smash him.  Paid him five dollars

myself less than two weeks ago to keep his eyes open. 

`TO KEEP HIS EYES OPEN!' '' panted the doctor, shaking

his fist at David.  ``Yes sir!  `To keep his eyes open!' 

And he motioned for things to come along, and so I

lost her too.''



``I think we had better go back to the street,'' said

the Harvester.



``Oh, I'd been back and forth along that street for

nearly an hour before I gave up and came here to see

if I could find you, and we've hunted it an hour more! 

What's the use?  She's gone for this time, but by gum,

I saw her!  And she was worth seeing!''



``Did she appear ill to you?''



The doctor dropped on a chair and threw out his hands

hopelessly.



``This was awful sudden, David,'' he said.  ``I was

going along as I told you, and I noticed her stop and

thought she had a good head to wait a second instead

of running in before me, and there came those two girls

right under the car from the other side.  I only had

a glimpse of her as she stooped for the flowers.  I saw

a big braid of hair, but I was half a block away before

I got it all connected, and then came the crush in the

street, and I was blocked.''



The doctor broke down and wiped his face and

expressed his feelings unrestrainedly.



``Don't!'' said the Harvester patiently.  ``It's no use

to feel so badly, Doc.  I know what you would give to

have found her for me.  I know you did all you could. 

I let her escape me.  We will find her yet.  It's glorious

news that she's in the city.  It gives me heart to hear

that.  Can't you just remember if she seemed ill?''



The doctor meditated.



``She wasn't the tallest girl I ever saw,'' he said slowly,

``but she was the tallest girl to be pretty.  She had on a

white waist and a gray skirt and black hat.  Her eyes

and hair were like you said, and she was plain, white

faced, with a hue that might possibly be natural, and

it might be confinement in bad light and air and poor

food.  She didn't seem sick, but she isn't well.  There

is something the matter with her, but it's not immediate

or dangerous.  She appeared like a flower that had got

a little moisture and sprouted in a cellar.''



``You saw her all right!'' said the Harvester, ``and

I think your diagnosis is correct too.  That's the way

she seemed to me.  I've thought she needed sun and air. 

I told the South Wind so the other day.''



``Why you blame fool!'' cried the doctor.  ``Is this

thing going to your head?  Say, I forgot!  There is

something else.  I traced her in the store.  She was at

the embroidery counter and she bought some silk.  If

she ever comes again the clerk is going to hold her and

telephone me or get her address if she has to steal it.  Oh,

we are getting there!  We will have her pretty soon now. 

You ought to feel better just to know that she is in town

and that I've seen her.''



``I do!'' said the Harvester.  ``Indeed I do!''



``It can't be much longer,'' said the doctor.  ``She's

got to be located soon.  But those policemen!  I wouldn't

give a nickel for the lot!  I'll bet she's walked over

them for two weeks.  If I were you I'd discharge the

bunch.  They'd be peacefully asleep if she passed them. 

If they'd let me alone, I'd have had her.  I could have

turned around easily.  I've been in dozens of closer

places.''



``Don't worry!  This can't last much longer.  She's

of and in the city or she wouldn't have picked up the

flowers.  Doc, are you sure they were mine?''



``Yes.  Half the girls have been tricked out in yours

the past two weeks.  I can spot them as far as I can

see.''



``Dear Lord, that's getting close!'' said the Harvester

intensely.  ``Seems as if the violets would tell her.''



``Now cut out flowers talking and the South Wind!''

ordered the doctor.  ``This is business.  The violets

prove something all right, though.  If she was in the

country, she could gather plenty herself.  She is working

at sewing in some room in town, either over a store

or in a house.  If she hadn't been starved for flowers

she never would have stopped for them on the street. 

I could see just a flash of hesitation, but she wanted them

too much.  David, one bouquet will go in water and be

cared for a week.  Man, it's getting close!  This does

seem like a link.''



``Since you say it, possibly I dare agree with you,''

said the Harvester.



``How near are you through with that canvass of

yours?''



``About three fourths.''



``Well I'd go on with it.  After all we have got to

find her ourselves.  Those senile policemen!''



``I am going on with it; you needn't worry about

that.  But I've got to change to other flowers.  I've

stripped the violet beds.  There's quite a crop of berries

coming, but they are not ripe yet, and a tragedy to

pick.  The pond lilies are just beginning to open by

the thousand.  The lake border is blue with sweet-flag

that is lovely and the marsh pale gold with cowslips. 

The ferns are prime and the woods solid sheets of every

colour of bloom.  I believe I'll go ahead with the wild

flowers.''



`` I would too!  David, you do feel better, don't you?''



``I certainly do, Doctor.  Surely it won't be long

now!''



The Harvester was so hopeful that he whistled and

sang on the return to Medicine Woods, and that night

for the first time in many days he sat long over a candlestick,

and took a farewell peep into her room before he

went to bed.



The next day he worked with all his might harvesting

the last remnants of early spring herbs, in the dry-room

and store-house, and on furniture and candlesticks.



Then he went back to flower gathering and every day

offered bunches of exquisite wood and field flowers and

white and gold water lilies from door to door.



Three weeks later the Harvester, perceptibly thin,

pale, and worried entered the office.  He sank into a

chair and groaned wearily.



``Isn't this the bitterest luck!'' he cried.  ``I've

finished the town.  I've almost walked off my legs.  I've

sold flowers by the million, but I've not had a sight of

her.''



``It's been almost a tragedy with me,'' said the doctor

gloomily.  ``I've killed two dogs and grazed a baby,

because I was watching the sidewalks instead of the

street.  What are you going to do now?''



``I am going home and bring up the work to the July

mark.  I am going to take it easy and rest a few days

so I can think more clearly.  I don't know what I'll

try next.  I've punched up the depot and the policemen

again.  When I get something new thought out I'll let

you know.''



Then he began emptying his pockets of money and

heaping it on the table, small coins, bills, big and little.



``What on earth is that?''



``That,'' said the Harvester, giving the heap a shove

of contempt, ``that is the price of my pride and humiliation. 

That is what it cost people who allowed me to

cheek my way into their homes and rob them, as one

maid said, for my own purposes.  Doc, where on earth

does all the money come from?  In almost every house

I entered, women had it to waste, in many cases to throw

away.  I never saw so much paid for nothing in all my

life.  That whole heap is from mushrooms and flowers.''



``What are you piling it there for?''



``For your free ward.  I don't want a penny of it.  I

wouldn't keep it, not if I was starving.''



``Why David!  You couldn't compel any one to buy. 

You offered something they wanted, and they paid you

what you asked.''



``Yes, and to keep them from buying, and to make

the stuff go farther, I named prices to shame a shark. 

When I think of that mushroom deal I can feel my

face burn.  I've made the search I wanted to, and I

am satisfied that I can't find her that way.  I have

kept up my work at home between times.  I am not

out anything but my time, and it isn't fair to plunder

the city to pay that.  Take that cussed money and put

it where I'll never see or hear of it.  Do anything you

please, except to ask me ever to profit by a cent.  When

I wash my hands after touching it for the last time

maybe I'll feel better.''



``You are a fanatic!''



``If getting rid of that is being a fanatic, I am proud of

the title.  You can't imagine what I've been through!''



``Can't I though?'' laughed the doctor.  ``In work

of that kind you get into every variety of place; and

some of it is new to you.  Never mind!  No one can

contaminate you.  It is the law that only a man can

degrade himself.  Knowing things will not harm you. 

Doing them is a different matter.  What you know

will be a protection.  What you do ruins----if it is

wrong.  You are not harmed, you are only disgusted. 

Think it over, and in a few days come back and get

your money.  It is strictly honest.  You earned every

cent of it.''



``If you ever speak of it again or force it on me I'll

take it home and throw it into the lake.''



He went after Betsy and slowly drove to Medicine

Woods.  Belshazzar, on the seat beside him, recognized

a silent, disappointed master and whimpered as he rubbed

the Harvester's shoulder to attract his attention.



``This is tough luck, old boy,'' said the Harvester. 

``I had such hopes and I worked so hard.  I suffered

in the flesh for every hour of it, and I failed.  Oh but

I hate the word!  If I knew where she is right now, Bel,

I'd give anything I've got.  But there's no use to wail

and get sorry for myself.  That's against the law of

common decency.  I'll take a swim, sleep it off, straighten

up the herbs a little, and go at it again, old fellow; that's

a man's way.  She's somewhere, and she's got to be

found, no matter what it costs.''
