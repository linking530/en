COMMENCEMENT OF THE GRAND CAMPAIGN--GENERAL BUTLER'S

POSITION--SHERIDAN'S FIRST RAID.



The armies were now all ready to move for the accomplishment of

a single object.  They were acting as a unit so far as such a

thing was possible over such a vast field.  Lee, with the

capital of the Confederacy, was the main end to which all were

working.  Johnston, with Atlanta, was an important obstacle in

the way of our accomplishing the result aimed at, and was

therefore almost an independent objective.  It was of less

importance only because the capture of Johnston and his army

would not produce so immediate and decisive a result in closing

the rebellion as would the possession of Richmond, Lee and his

army.  All other troops were employed exclusively in support of

these two movements.  This was the plan; and I will now endeavor

to give, as concisely as I can, the method of its execution,

outlining first the operations of minor detached but

co-operative columns.



As stated before, Banks failed to accomplish what he had been

sent to do on the Red River, and eliminated the use of forty

thousand veterans whose cooperation in the grand campaign had

been expected--ten thousand with Sherman and thirty thousand

against Mobile.



Sigel's record is almost equally brief.  He moved out, it is

true, according to programme; but just when I was hoping to hear

of good work being done in the valley I received instead the

following announcement from Halleck:  "Sigel is in full retreat

on Strasburg.  He will do nothing but run; never did anything

else."  The enemy had intercepted him about New Market and

handled him roughly, leaving him short six guns, and some nine

hundred men out of his six thousand.



The plan had been for an advance of Sigel's forces in two

columns.  Though the one under his immediate command failed

ingloriously the other proved more fortunate.  Under Crook and

Averell his western column advanced from the Gauley in West

Virginia at the appointed time, and with more happy results.

They reached the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad at Dublin and

destroyed a depot of supplies, besides tearing up several miles

of road and burning the bridge over New River.  Having

accomplished this they recrossed the Alleghanies to Meadow

Bluffs and there awaited further orders.



Butler embarked at Fort Monroe with all his command, except the

cavalry and some artillery which moved up the south bank of the

James River.  His steamers moved first up Chesapeake Bay and

York River as if threatening the rear of Lee's army.  At

midnight they turned back, and Butler by daylight was far up the

James River.  He seized City Point and Bermuda Hundred early in

the day, without loss and, no doubt, very much to the surprise

of the enemy.



This was the accomplishment of the first step contemplated in my

instructions to Butler.  He was to act from here, looking to

Richmond as his objective point.  I had given him to understand

that I should aim to fight Lee between the Rapidan and Richmond

if he would stand; but should Lee fall back into Richmond I

would follow up and make a junction of the armies of the Potomac

and the James on the James River.  He was directed to secure a

footing as far up the south side of the river as he could at as

early a date as possible.



Butler was in position by the 6th of May and had begun

intrenching, and on the 7th he sent out his cavalry from Suffolk

to cut the Weldon Railroad.  He also sent out detachments to

destroy the railroad between Petersburg and Richmond, but no

great success attended these latter efforts.  He made no great

effort to establish himself on that road and neglected to attack

Petersburg, which was almost defenceless.  About the 11th he

advanced slowly until he reached the works at Drury's Bluff,

about half way between Bermuda Hundred and Richmond.  In the

mean time Beauregard had been gathering reinforcements.  On the

16th he attacked Butler with great vigor, and with such success

as to limit very materially the further usefulness of the Army

of the James as a distinct factor in the campaign.  I afterward

ordered a portion of it to join the Army of the Potomac, leaving

a sufficient force with Butler to man his works, hold securely

the footing he had already gained and maintain a threatening

front toward the rear of the Confederate capital.



The position which General Butler had chosen between the two

rivers, the James and Appomattox, was one of great natural

strength, one where a large area of ground might be thoroughly

inclosed by means of a single intrenched line, and that a very

short one in comparison with the extent of territory which it

thoroughly protected.  His right was protected by the James

River, his left by the Appomattox, and his rear by their

junction--the two streams uniting near by.  The bends of the two

streams shortened the line that had been chosen for

intrenchments, while it increased the area which the line

inclosed.



Previous to ordering any troops from Butler I sent my chief

engineer, General Barnard, from the Army of the Potomac to that

of the James to inspect Butler's position and ascertain whether

I could again safely make an order for General Butler's movement

in co-operation with mine, now that I was getting so near

Richmond; or, if I could not, whether his position was strong

enough to justify me in withdrawing some of his troops and

having them brought round by water to White House to join me and

reinforce the Army of the Potomac.  General Barnard reported the

position very strong for defensive purposes, and that I could do

the latter with great security; but that General Butler could not

move from where he was, in co-operation, to produce any effect.

He said that the general occupied a place between the James and

Appomattox rivers which was of great strength, and where with an

inferior force he could hold it for an indefinite length of time

against a superior; but that he could do nothing offensively.  I

then asked him why Butler could not move out from his lines and

push across the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad to the rear and

on the south side of Richmond.  He replied that it was

impracticable, because the enemy had substantially the same line

across the neck of land that General Butler had.  He then took

out his pencil and drew a sketch of the locality, remarking that

the position was like a bottle and that Butler's line of

intrenchments across the neck represented the cork; that the

enemy had built an equally strong line immediately in front of

him across the neck; and it was therefore as if Butler was in a

bottle.  He was perfectly safe against an attack; but, as

Barnard expressed it, the enemy had corked the bottle and with a

small force could hold the cork in its place.  This struck me as

being very expressive of his position, particularly when I saw

the hasty sketch which General Barnard had drawn; and in making

my subsequent report I used that expression without adding

quotation marks, never thinking that anything had been said that

would attract attention--as this did, very much to the annoyance,

no doubt, of General Butler and, I know, very much to my own.  I

found afterwards that this was mentioned in the notes of General

Badeau's book, which, when they were shown to me, I asked to have

stricken out; yet it was retained there, though against my

wishes.



I make this statement here because, although I have often made

it before, it has never been in my power until now to place it

where it will correct history; and I desire to rectify all

injustice that I may have done to individuals, particularly to

officers who were gallantly serving their country during the

trying period of the war for the preservation of the Union.

General Butler certainly gave his very earnest support to the

war; and he gave his own best efforts personally to the

suppression of the rebellion.



The further operations of the Army of the James can best be

treated of in connection with those of the Army of the Potomac,

the two being so intimately associated and connected as to be

substantially one body in which the individuality of the

supporting wing is merged.



Before giving the reader a summary of Sherman's great Atlanta

campaign, which must conclude my description of the various

co-operative movements preparatory to proceeding with that of

the operations of the centre, I will briefly mention Sheridan's

first raid upon Lee's communications which, though an incident

of the operations on the main line and not specifically marked

out in the original plan, attained in its brilliant execution

and results all the proportions of an independent campaign.  By

thus anticipating, in point of time, I will be able to more

perfectly observe the continuity of events occurring in my

immediate front when I shall have undertaken to describe our

advance from the Rapidan.



On the 8th of May, just after the battle of the Wilderness and

when we were moving on Spottsylvania I directed Sheridan

verbally to cut loose from the Army of the Potomac, pass around

the left of Lee's army and attack his cavalry:  to cut the two

roads--one running west through Gordonsville, Charlottesville

and Lynchburg, the other to Richmond, and, when compelled to do

so for want of forage and rations, to move on to the James River

and draw these from Butler's supplies.  This move took him past

the entire rear of Lee's army.  These orders were also given in

writing through Meade.



The object of this move was three-fold.  First, if successfully

executed, and it was, he would annoy the enemy by cutting his

line of supplies and telegraphic communications, and destroy or

get for his own use supplies in store in the rear and coming

up.  Second, he would draw the enemy's cavalry after him, and

thus better protect our flanks, rear and trains than by

remaining with the army.  Third, his absence would save the

trains drawing his forage and other supplies from

Fredericksburg, which had now become our base.  He started at

daylight the next morning, and accomplished more than was

expected.  It was sixteen days before he got back to the Army of

the Potomac.



The course Sheridan took was directly to Richmond.  Before night

Stuart, commanding the Confederate cavalry, came on to the rear

of his command.  But the advance kept on, crossed the North

Anna, and at Beaver Dam, a station on the Virginia Central

Railroad, recaptured four hundred Union prisoners on their way

to Richmond, destroyed the road and used and destroyed a large

amount of subsistence and medical stores.



Stuart, seeing that our cavalry was pushing towards Richmond,

abandoned the pursuit on the morning of the 10th and, by a

detour and an exhausting march, interposed between Sheridan and

Richmond at Yellow Tavern, only about six miles north of the

city.  Sheridan destroyed the railroad and more supplies at

Ashland, and on the 11th arrived in Stuart's front.  A severe

engagement ensued in which the losses were heavy on both sides,

but the rebels were beaten, their leader mortally wounded, and

some guns and many prisoners were captured.



Sheridan passed through the outer defences of Richmond, and

could, no doubt, have passed through the inner ones.  But having

no supports near he could not have remained.  After caring for

his wounded he struck for the James River below the city, to

communicate with Butler and to rest his men and horses as well

as to get food and forage for them.



He moved first between the Chickahominy and the James, but in

the morning (the 12th) he was stopped by batteries at

Mechanicsville.  He then turned to cross to the north side of

the Chickahominy by Meadow Bridge.  He found this barred, and

the defeated Confederate cavalry, reorganized, occupying the

opposite side.  The panic created by his first entrance within

the outer works of Richmond having subsided troops were sent out

to attack his rear.



He was now in a perilous position, one from which but few

generals could have extricated themselves.  The defences of

Richmond, manned, were to the right, the Chickahominy was to the

left with no bridge remaining and the opposite bank guarded, to

the rear was a force from Richmond.  This force was attacked and

beaten by Wilson's and Gregg's divisions, while Sheridan turned

to the left with the remaining division and hastily built a

bridge over the Chickahominy under the fire of the enemy, forced

a crossing and soon dispersed the Confederates he found there.

The enemy was held back from the stream by the fire of the

troops not engaged in bridge building.



On the 13th Sheridan was at Bottom's Bridge, over the

Chickahominy.  On the 14th he crossed this stream and on that

day went into camp on the James River at Haxall's Landing.  He

at once put himself into communication with General Butler, who

directed all the supplies he wanted to be furnished.



Sheridan had left the Army of the Potomac at Spottsylvania, but

did not know where either this or Lee's army was now.  Great

caution therefore had to be exercised in getting back.  On the

17th, after resting his command for three days, he started on

his return.  He moved by the way of White House.  The bridge

over the Pamunkey had been burned by the enemy, but a new one

was speedily improvised and the cavalry crossed over it.  On the

22d he was at Aylett's on the Matapony, where he learned the

position of the two armies.  On the 24th he joined us on the

march from North Anna to Cold Harbor, in the vicinity of

Chesterfield.



Sheridan in this memorable raid passed entirely around Lee's

army:  encountered his cavalry in four engagements, and defeated

them in all; recaptured four hundred Union prisoners and killed

and captured many of the enemy; destroyed and used many supplies

and munitions of war; destroyed miles of railroad and telegraph,

and freed us from annoyance by the cavalry of the enemy for more

than two weeks.
