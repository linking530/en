The cause of the great War of the Rebellion against the United

Status will have to be attributed to slavery.  For some years

before the war began it was a trite saying among some

politicians that "A state half slave and half free cannot

exist."  All must become slave or all free, or the state will go

down.  I took no part myself in any such view of the case at the

time, but since the war is over, reviewing the whole question, I

have come to the conclusion that the saying is quite true.



Slavery was an institution that required unusual guarantees for

its security wherever it existed; and in a country like ours

where the larger portion of it was free territory inhabited by

an intelligent and well-to-do population, the people would

naturally have but little sympathy with demands upon them for

its protection.  Hence the people of the South were dependent

upon keeping control of the general government to secure the

perpetuation of their favorite restitution.  They were enabled

to maintain this control long after the States where slavery

existed had ceased to have the controlling power, through the

assistance they received from odd men here and there throughout

the Northern States.  They saw their power waning, and this led

them to encroach upon the prerogatives and independence of the

Northern States by enacting such laws as the Fugitive Slave

Law.  By this law every Northern man was obliged, when properly

summoned, to turn out and help apprehend the runaway slave of a

Southern man.  Northern marshals became slave-catchers, and

Northern courts had to contribute to the support and protection

of the institution.



This was a degradation which the North would not permit any

longer than until they could get the power to expunge such laws

from the statute books.  Prior to the time of these

encroachments the great majority of the people of the North had

no particular quarrel with slavery, so long as they were not

forced to have it themselves.  But they were not willing to play

the role of police for the South in the protection of this

particular institution.



In the early days of the country, before we had railroads,

telegraphs and steamboats--in a word, rapid transit of any

sort--the States were each almost a separate nationality.  At

that time the subject of slavery caused but little or no

disturbance to the public mind.  But the country grew, rapid

transit was established, and trade and commerce between the

States got to be so much greater than before, that the power of

the National government became more felt and recognized and,

therefore, had to be enlisted in the cause of this institution.



It is probably well that we had the war when we did.  We are

better off now than we would have been without it, and have made

more rapid progress than we otherwise should have made.  The

civilized nations of Europe have been stimulated into unusual

activity, so that commerce, trade, travel, and thorough

acquaintance among people of different nationalities, has become

common; whereas, before, it was but the few who had ever had the

privilege of going beyond the limits of their own country or who

knew anything about other people.  Then, too, our republican

institutions were regarded as experiments up to the breaking out

of the rebellion, and monarchical Europe generally believed that

our republic was a rope of sand that would part the moment the

slightest strain was brought upon it.  Now it has shown itself

capable of dealing with one of the greatest wars that was ever

made, and our people have proven themselves to be the most

formidable in war of any nationality.



But this war was a fearful lesson, and should teach us the

necessity of avoiding wars in the future.



The conduct of some of the European states during our troubles

shows the lack of conscience of communities where the

responsibility does not come upon a single individual.  Seeing a

nation that extended from ocean to ocean, embracing the better

part of a continent, growing as we were growing in population,

wealth and intelligence, the European nations thought it would

be well to give us a check.  We might, possibly, after a while

threaten their peace, or, at least, the perpetuity of their

institutions.  Hence, England was constantly finding fault with

the administration at Washington because we were not able to

keep up an effective blockade.  She also joined, at first, with

France and Spain in setting up an Austrian prince upon the

throne in Mexico, totally disregarding any rights or claims that

Mexico had of being treated as an independent power.  It is true

they trumped up grievances as a pretext, but they were only

pretexts which can always be found when wanted.



Mexico, in her various revolutions, had been unable to give that

protection to the subjects of foreign nations which she would

have liked to give, and some of her revolutionary leaders had

forced loans from them.  Under pretence of protecting their

citizens, these nations seized upon Mexico as a foothold for

establishing a European monarchy upon our continent, thus

threatening our peace at home.  I, myself, regarded this as a

direct act of war against the United States by the powers

engaged, and supposed as a matter of course that the United

States would treat it as such when their hands were free to

strike.  I often spoke of the matter to Mr. Lincoln and the

Secretary of War, but never heard any special views from them to

enable me to judge what they thought or felt about it.  I

inferred that they felt a good deal as I did, but were unwilling

to commit themselves while we had our own troubles upon our

hands.



All of the powers except France very soon withdrew from the

armed intervention for the establishment of an Austrian prince

upon the throne of Mexico; but the governing people of these

countries continued to the close of the war to throw obstacles

in our way.  After the surrender of Lee, therefore, entertaining

the opinion here expressed, I sent Sheridan with a corps to the

Rio Grande to have him where he might aid Juarez in expelling

the French from Mexican.  These troops got off before they could

be stopped; and went to the Rio Grande, where Sheridan

distributed them up and down the river, much to the

consternation of the troops in the quarter of Mexico bordering

on that stream.  This soon led to a request from France that we

should withdraw our troops from the Rio Grande and to

negotiations for the withdrawal of theirs.  Finally Bazaine was

withdrawn from Mexico by order of the French Government.  From

that day the empire began to totter.  Mexico was then able to

maintain her independence without aid from us.



France is the traditional ally and friend of the United

States.  I did not blame France for her part in the scheme to

erect a monarchy upon the ruins of the Mexican Republic.  That

was the scheme of one man, an imitator without genius or

merit.  He had succeeded in stealing the government of his

country, and made a change in its form against the wishes and

instincts of his people.  He tried to play the part of the first

Napoleon, without the ability to sustain that role.  He sought by

new conquests to add to his empire and his glory; but the signal

failure of his scheme of conquest was the precursor of his own

overthrow.



Like our own war between the States, the Franco-Prussian war was

an expensive one; but it was worth to France all it cost her

people.  It was the completion of the downfall of Napoleon

III.  The beginning was when he landed troops on this

continent.  Failing here, the prestige of his name--all the

prestige he ever had--was gone.  He must achieve a success or

fall.  He tried to strike down his neighbor, Prussia--and fell.



I never admired the character of the first Napoleon; but I

recognize his great genius.  His work, too, has left its impress

for good on the face of Europe.  The third Napoleon could have no

claim to having done a good or just act.



To maintain peace in the future it is necessary to be prepared

for war.  There can scarcely be a possible chance of a conflict,

such as the last one, occurring among our own people again; but,

growing as we are, in population, wealth and military power, we

may become the envy of nations which led us in all these

particulars only a few years ago; and unless we are prepared for

it we may be in danger of a combined movement being some day made

to crush us out.  Now, scarcely twenty years after the war, we

seem to have forgotten the lessons it taught, and are going on

as if in the greatest security, without the power to resist an

invasion by the fleets of fourth-rate European powers for a time

until we could prepare for them.



We should have a good navy, and our sea-coast defences should be

put in the finest possible condition.  Neither of these cost much

when it is considered where the money goes, and what we get in

return.  Money expended in a fine navy, not only adds to our

security and tends to prevent war in the future, but is very

material aid to our commerce with foreign nations in the

meantime.  Money spent upon sea-coast defences is spent among

our own people, and all goes back again among the people.  The

work accomplished, too, like that of the navy, gives us a

feeling of security.



England's course towards the United States during the rebellion

exasperated the people of this country very much against the

mother country.  I regretted it.  England and the United States

are natural allies, and should be the best of friends.  They

speak one language, and are related by blood and other ties.  We

together, or even either separately, are better qualified than

any other people to establish commerce between all the

nationalities of the world.



England governs her own colonies, and particularly those

embracing the people of different races from her own, better

than any other nation.  She is just to the conquered, but

rigid.  She makes them self-supporting, but gives the benefit of

labor to the laborer.  She does not seem to look upon the

colonies as outside possessions which she is at liberty to work

for the support and aggrandizement of the home government.



The hostility of England to the United States during our

rebellion was not so much real as it was apparent.  It was the

hostility of the leaders of one political party.  I am told that

there was no time during the civil war when they were able to get

up in England a demonstration in favor of secession, while these

were constantly being gotten up in favor of the Union, or, as

they called it, in favor of the North.  Even in Manchester,

which suffered so fearfully by having the cotton cut off from

her mills, they had a monster demonstration in favor of the

North at the very time when their workmen were almost famishing.



It is possible that the question of a conflict between races may

come up in the future, as did that between freedom and slavery

before.  The condition of the colored man within our borders may

become a source of anxiety, to say the least.  But he was brought

to our shores by compulsion, and he now should be considered as

having as good a right to remain here as any other class of our

citizens.  It was looking to a settlement of this question that

led me to urge the annexation of Santo Domingo during the time I

was President of the United States.



Santo Domingo was freely offered to us, not only by the

administration, but by all the people, almost without price. The

island is upon our shores, is very fertile, and is capable of

supporting fifteen millions of people.  The products of the soil

are so valuable that labor in her fields would be so compensated

as to enable those who wished to go there to quickly repay the

cost of their passage.  I took it that the colored people would

go there in great numbers, so as to have independent states

governed by their own race.  They would still be States of the

Union, and under the protection of the General Government; but

the citizens would be almost wholly colored.



By the war with Mexico, we had acquired, as we have seen,

territory almost equal in extent to that we already possessed.

It was seen that the volunteers of the Mexican war largely

composed the pioneers to settle up the Pacific coast country.

Their numbers, however, were scarcely sufficient to be a nucleus

for the population of the important points of the territory

acquired by that war.  After our rebellion, when so many young

men were at liberty to return to their homes, they found they

were not satisfied with the farm, the store, or the work-shop of

the villages, but wanted larger fields.  The mines of the

mountains first attracted them; but afterwards they found that

rich valleys and productive grazing and farming lands were

there.  This territory, the geography of which was not known to

us at the close of the rebellion, is now as well mapped as any

portion of our country.  Railroads traverse it in every

direction, north, south, east, and west.  The mines are

worked.  The high lands are used for grazing purposes, and rich

agricultural lands are found in many of the valleys.  This is

the work of the volunteer.  It is probable that the Indians

would have had control of these lands for a century yet but for

the war.  We must conclude, therefore, that wars are not always

evils unmixed with some good.



Prior to the rebellion the great mass of the people were

satisfied to remain near the scenes of their birth.  In fact an

immense majority of the whole people did not feel secure against

coming to want should they move among entire strangers.  So much

was the country divided into small communities that localized

idioms had grown up, so that you could almost tell what section

a person was from by hearing him speak.  Before, new territories

were settled by a "class"; people who shunned contact with

others; people who, when the country began to settle up around

them, would push out farther from civilization.  Their guns

furnished meat, and the cultivation of a very limited amount of

the soil, their bread and vegetables.  All the streams abounded

with fish.  Trapping would furnish pelts to be brought into the

States once a year, to pay for necessary articles which they

could not raise--powder, lead, whiskey, tobacco and some store

goods.  Occasionally some little articles of luxury would enter

into these purchases--a quarter of a pound of tea, two or three

pounds of coffee, more of sugar, some playing cards, and if

anything was left over of the proceeds of the sale, more whiskey.



Little was known of the topography of the country beyond the

settlements of these frontiersmen.  This is all changed now. The

war begot a spirit of independence and enterprise.  The feeling

now is, that a youth must cut loose from his old surroundings to

enable him to get up in the world.  There is now such a

commingling of the people that particular idioms and

pronunciation are no longer localized to any great extent; the

country has filled up "from the centre all around to the sea";

railroads connect the two oceans and all parts of the interior;

maps, nearly perfect, of every part of the country are now

furnished the student of geography.



The war has made us a nation of great power and intelligence. We

have but little to do to preserve peace, happiness and prosperity

at home, and the respect of other nations.  Our experience ought

to teach us the necessity of the first; our power secures the

latter.



I feel that we are on the eve of a new era, when there is to be

great harmony between the Federal and Confederate.  I cannot

stay to be a living witness to the correctness of this prophecy;

but I feel it within me that it is to be so.  The universally

kind feeling expressed for me at a time when it was supposed

that each day would prove my last, seemed to me the beginning of

the answer to "Let us have peace."



The expression of these kindly feelings were not restricted to a

section of the country, nor to a division of the people.  They

came from individual citizens of all nationalities; from all

denominations--the Protestant, the Catholic, and the Jew; and

from the various societies of the land--scientific, educational,

religious or otherwise.  Politics did not enter into the matter

at all.



I am not egotist enough to suppose all this significance should

be given because I was the object of it.  But the war between

the States was a very bloody and a very costly war.  One side or

the other had to yield principles they deemed dearer than life

before it could be brought to an end.  I commanded the whole of

the mighty host engaged on the victorious side.  I was, no

matter whether deservedly so or not, a representative of that

side of the controversy.  It is a significant and gratifying

fact that Confederates should have joined heartily in this

spontaneous move.  I hope the good feeling inaugurated may

continue to the end.
