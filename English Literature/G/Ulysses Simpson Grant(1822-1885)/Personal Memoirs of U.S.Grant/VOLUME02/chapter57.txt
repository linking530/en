RAID ON THE VIRGINIA CENTRAL RAILROAD--RAID ON THE WELDON

RAILROAD--EARLY 'S MOVEMENT UPON WASHINGTON--MINING THE WORKS

BEFORE PETERSBURG--EXPLOSION OF THE MINE BEFORE

PETERSBURG--CAMPAIGN IN THE SHENANDOAH VALLEY--CAPTURE OF THE

WELDON RAILROAD.



On the 7th of June, while at Cold Harbor, I had as already

indicated sent Sheridan with two divisions of cavalry to destroy

as much as he could of the Virginia Central Railroad.  General

Hunter had been operating up the Shenandoah Valley with some

success, having fought a battle near Staunton where he captured

a great many prisoners, besides killing and wounding a good many

men.  After the battle he formed a junction at Staunton with

Averell and Crook, who had come up from the Kanawha, or Gauley

River.  It was supposed, therefore, that General Hunter would be

about Charlottesville, Virginia, by the time Sheridan could get

there, doing on the way the damage that he was sent to do.



I gave Sheridan instructions to have Hunter, in case he should

meet him about Charlottesville, join and return with him to the

Army of the Potomac.  Lee, hearing of Hunter's success in the

valley, started Breckinridge out for its defence at once.

Learning later of Sheridan's going with two divisions, he also

sent Hampton with two divisions of cavalry, his own and

Fitz-Hugh Lee's.



Sheridan moved to the north side of the North Anna to get out

west, and learned of the movement of these troops to the south

side of the same stream almost as soon as they had started. He

pushed on to get to Trevilian Station to commence his

destruction at that point.  On the night of the 10th he

bivouacked some six or seven miles east of Trevilian, while

Fitz-Hugh Lee was the same night at Trevilian Station and

Hampton but a few miles away.



During the night Hampton ordered an advance on Sheridan, hoping,

no doubt, to surprise and very badly cripple him.  Sheridan,

however, by a counter move sent Custer on a rapid march to get

between the two divisions of the enemy and into their rear. This

he did successfully, so that at daylight, when the assault was

made, the enemy found himself at the same time resisted in front

and attacked in rear, and broke in some confusion.  The losses

were probably very light on both sides in killed and wounded,

but Sheridan got away with some five hundred prisoners and sent

them to City Point.



During that day, the 11th, Sheridan moved into Trevilian

Station, and the following day proceeded to tear up the road

east and west.  There was considerable fighting during the whole

of the day, but the work of destruction went on.  In the

meantime, at night, the enemy had taken possession of the

crossing which Sheridan had proposed to take to go north when he

left Trevilian.  Sheridan learned, however, from some of the

prisoners he had captured here, that General Hunter was about

Lynchburg, and therefore that there was no use of his going on

to Charlottesville with a view to meet him.



Sheridan started back during the night of the 12th, and made his

way north and farther east, coming around by the north side of

White House, and arriving there on the 21st.  Here he found an

abundance of forage for his animals, food for his men, and

security while resting.  He had been obliged to leave about

ninety of his own men in the field-hospital which he had

established near Trevilian, and these necessarily fell into the

hands of the enemy.



White House up to this time had been a depot; but now that our

troops were all on the James River, it was no longer wanted as a

store of supplies.  Sheridan was, therefore, directed to break it

up; which he did on the 22d of June, bringing the garrison and an

immense wagon train with him.  All these were over the James

River by the 26th of the month, and Sheridan ready to follow.



In the meantime Meade had sent Wilson's division on a raid to

destroy the Weldon and South Side roads.  Now that Sheridan was

safe and Hampton free to return to Richmond with his cavalry,

Wilson's position became precarious.  Meade therefore, on the

27th, ordered Sheridan over the river to make a demonstration in

favor of Wilson.  Wilson got back, though not without severe

loss, having struck both roads, but the damage done was soon

repaired.



After these events comparative quiet reigned about Petersburg

until late in July.  The time, however, was spent in

strengthening the intrenchments and making our position

generally more secure against a sudden attack.  In the meantime

I had to look after other portions of my command, where things

had not been going on so favorably, always, as I could have

wished.



General Hunter who had been appointed to succeed Sigel in the

Shenandoah Valley immediately took up the offensive.  He met the

enemy on the 5th of June at Piedmont, and defeated him.  On the

8th he formed a junction with Crook and Averell at Staunton,

from which place he moved direct on Lynchburg, via Lexington,

which he reached and invested on the 16th.  Up to this time he

was very successful; and but for the difficulty of taking with

him sufficient ordnance stores over so long a march, through a

hostile country, he would, no doubt, have captured Lynchburg.

The destruction of the enemy's supplies and manufactories had

been very great.  To meet this movement under General Hunter,

General Lee sent Early with his corps, a part of which reached

Lynchburg before Hunter.  After some skirmishing on the 17th and

18th, General Hunter, owing to a want of ammunition to give

battle, retired from before the place.  Unfortunately, this want

of ammunition left him no choice of route for his return but by

the way of the Gauley and Kanawha rivers, thence up the Ohio

River, returning to Harper's Ferry by way of the Baltimore and

Ohio Railroad.  A long time was consumed in making this

movement.  Meantime the valley was left open to Early's troops,

and others in that quarter; and Washington also was uncovered.

Early took advantage of this condition of affairs and moved on

Washington.



In the absence of Hunter, General Lew Wallace, with headquarters

at Baltimore, commanded the department in which the Shenandoah

lay.  His surplus of troops with which to move against the enemy

was small in number.  Most of these were raw and, consequently,

very much inferior to our veterans and to the veterans which

Early had with him; but the situation of Washington was

precarious, and Wallace moved with commendable promptitude to

meet the enemy at the Monocacy.  He could hardly have expected

to defeat him badly, but he hoped to cripple and delay him until

Washington could be put into a state of preparation for his

reception.  I had previously ordered General Meade to send a

division to Baltimore for the purpose of adding to the defences

of Washington, and he had sent Ricketts's division of the 6th

corps (Wright's), which arrived in Baltimore on the 8th of

July.  Finding that Wallace had gone to the front with his

command, Ricketts immediately took the cars and followed him to

the Monocacy with his entire division.  They met the enemy and,

as might have been expected, were defeated; but they succeeded

in stopping him for the day on which the battle took place.  The

next morning Early started on his march to the capital of the

Nation, arriving before it on the 11th.



Learning of the gravity of the situation I had directed General

Meade to also order Wright with the rest of his corps directly

to Washington for the relief of that place, and the latter

reached there the very day that Early arrived before it.  The

19th corps, which had been stationed in Louisiana, having been

ordered up to reinforce the armies about Richmond, had about

this time arrived at Fortress Monroe, on their way to join us. I

diverted them from that point to Washington, which place they

reached, almost simultaneously with Wright, on the 11th.  The

19th corps was commanded by Major-General Emory.



Early made his reconnoissance with a view of attacking on the

following morning, the 12th; but the next morning he found our

intrenchments, which were very strong, fully manned.  He at once

commenced to retreat, Wright following.  There is no telling how

much this result was contributed to by General Lew Wallace's

leading what might well be considered almost a forlorn hope.  If

Early had been but one day earlier he might have entered the

capital before the arrival of the reinforcements I had sent.

Whether the delay caused by the battle amounted to a day or not,

General Wallace contributed on this occasion, by the defeat of

the troops under him a greater benefit to the cause than often

falls to the lot of a commander of an equal force to render by

means of a victory.



Farther west also the troubles were threatening.  Some time

before, Forrest had met Sturgis in command of some of our

cavalry in Mississippi and handled him very roughly, gaining a

very great victory over him.  This left Forrest free to go

almost where he pleased, and to cut the roads in rear of Sherman

who was then advancing.  Sherman was abundantly able to look

after the army that he was immediately with, and all of his

military division so long as he could communicate with it; but

it was my place to see that he had the means with which to hold

his rear.  Two divisions under A. J. Smith had been sent to

Banks in Louisiana some months before.  Sherman ordered these

back, with directions to attack Forrest.  Smith met and defeated

him very badly.  I then directed that Smith should hang to

Forrest and not let him go; and to prevent by all means his

getting upon the Memphis and Nashville Railroad.  Sherman had

anticipated me in this matter, and given the same orders in

substance; but receiving my directions for this order to Smith,

he repeated it.



On the 25th of June General Burnside had commenced running a

mine from about the centre of his front under the Confederate

works confronting him.  He was induced to do this by Colonel

Pleasants, of the Pennsylvania Volunteers, whose regiment was

mostly composed of miners, and who was himself a practical

miner.  Burnside had submitted the scheme to Meade and myself,

and we both approved of it, as a means of keeping the men

occupied.  His position was very favorable for carrying on this

work, but not so favorable for the operations to follow its

completion.  The position of the two lines at that point were

only about a hundred yards apart with a comparatively deep

ravine intervening.  In the bottom of this ravine the work

commenced.  The position was unfavorable in this particular:

that the enemy's line at that point was re-entering, so that its

front was commanded by their own lines both to the right and

left.  Then, too, the ground was sloping upward back of the

Confederate line for a considerable distance, and it was

presumable that the enemy had, at least, a detached work on this

highest point.  The work progressed, and on the 23d of July the

mine was finished ready for charging; but I had this work of

charging deferred until we were ready for it.



On the 17th of July several deserters came in and said that

there was great consternation in Richmond, and that Lee was

coming out to make an attack upon us the object being to put us

on the defensive so that he might detach troops to go to Georgia

where the army Sherman was operating against was said to be in

great trouble.  I put the army commanders, Meade and Butler, on

the lookout, but the attack was not made.



I concluded, then, a few days later, to do something in the way

of offensive movement myself, having in view something of the

same object that Lee had had.  Wright's and Emory's corps were

in Washington, and with this reduction of my force Lee might

very readily have spared some troops from the defences to send

West.  I had other objects in view, however, besides keeping Lee

where he was.  The mine was constructed and ready to be exploded,

and I wanted to take that occasion to carry Petersburg if I

could.  It was the object, therefore, to get as many of Lee's

troops away from the south side of the James River as

possible.  Accordingly, on the 26th, we commenced a movement

with Hancock's corps and Sheridan's cavalry to the north side by

the way of Deep Bottom, where Butler had a pontoon bridge laid.

The plan, in the main, was to let the cavalry cut loose and,

joining with Kautz's cavalry of the Army of the James, get by

Lee's lines and destroy as much as they could of the Virginia

Central Railroad, while, in the mean time, the infantry was to

move out so as to protect their rear and cover their retreat

back when they should have got through with their work.  We were

successful in drawing the enemy's troops to the north side of the

James as I expected.  The mine was ordered to be charged, and the

morning of the 30th of July was the time fixed for its

explosion.  I gave Meade minute orders (*38) on the 24th

directing how I wanted the assault conducted, which orders he

amplified into general instructions for the guidance of the

troops that were to be engaged.



Meade's instructions, which I, of course, approved most

heartily, were all that I can see now was necessary.  The only

further precaution which he could have taken, and which he could

not foresee, would have been to have different men to execute

them.



The gallery to the mine was over five hundred feet long from

where it entered the ground to the point where it was under the

enemy's works, and with a cross gallery of something over eighty

feet running under their lines.  Eight chambers had been left,

requiring a ton of powder each to charge them.  All was ready by

the time I had prescribed; and on the 29th Hancock and Sheridan

were brought back near the James River with their troops.  Under

cover of night they started to recross the bridge at Deep Bottom,

and to march directly for that part of our lines in front of the

mine.



Warren was to hold his line of intrenchments with a sufficient

number of men and concentrate the balance on the right next to

Burnside's corps, while Ord, now commanding the 18th corps,

temporarily under Meade, was to form in the rear of Burnside to

support him when he went in.  All were to clear off the parapets

and the _abatis_ in their front so as to leave the space as open

as possible, and be able to charge the moment the mine had been

sprung and Burnside had taken possession.  Burnside's corps was

not to stop in the crater at all but push on to the top of the

hill, supported on the right and left by Ord's and Warren's

corps.



Warren and Ord fulfilled their instructions perfectly so far as

making ready was concerned.  Burnside seemed to have paid no

attention whatever to the instructions, and left all the

obstruction in his own front for his troops to get over in the

best way they could.  The four divisions of his corps were

commanded by Generals Potter, Willcox, Ledlie and Ferrero.  The

last was a colored division; and Burnside selected it to make

the assault.  Meade interfered with this.  Burnside then took

Ledlie's division--a worse selection than the first could have

been.  In fact, Potter and Willcox were the only division

commanders Burnside had who were equal to the occasion.  Ledlie

besides being otherwise inefficient, proved also to possess

disqualification less common among soldiers.



There was some delay about the explosion of the mine so that it

did not go off until about five o'clock in the morning.  When it

did explode it was very successful, making a crater twenty feet

deep and something like a hundred feet in length.  Instantly one

hundred and ten cannon and fifty mortars, which had been placed

in the most commanding positions covering the ground to the

right and left of where the troops were to enter the enemy's

lines, commenced playing.  Ledlie's division marched into the

crater immediately on the explosion, but most of the men stopped

there in the absence of any one to give directions; their

commander having found some safe retreat to get into before they

started.  There was some delay on the left and right in

advancing, but some of the troops did get in and turn to the

right and left, carrying the rifle-pits as I expected they would

do.



There had been great consternation in Petersburg, as we were

well aware, about a rumored mine that we were going to

explode.  They knew we were mining, and they had failed to cut

our mine off by countermining, though Beauregard had taken the

precaution to run up a line of intrenchments to the rear of that

part of their line fronting where they could see that our men

were at work.  We had learned through deserters who had come in

that the people had very wild rumors about what was going on on

our side.  They said that we had undermined the whole of

Petersburg; that they were resting upon a slumbering volcano and

did not know at what moment they might expect an eruption.  I

somewhat based my calculations upon this state of feeling, and

expected that when the mine was exploded the troops to the right

and left would flee in all directions, and that our troops, if

they moved promptly, could get in and strengthen themselves

before the enemy had come to a realization of the true

situation.  It was just as I expected it would be.  We could see

the men running without any apparent object except to get away.

It was half an hour before musketry firing, to amount to

anything, was opened upon our men in the crater.  It was an hour

before the enemy got artillery up to play upon them; and it was

nine o'clock before Lee got up reinforcements from his right to

join in expelling our troops.



The effort was a stupendous failure.  It cost us about four

thousand men, mostly, however, captured; and all due to

inefficiency on the part of the corps commander and the

incompetency of the division commander who was sent to lead the

assault.



After being fully assured of the failure of the mine, and

finding that most of that part of Lee's army which had been

drawn north of the James River were still there, I gave Meade

directions to send a corps of infantry and the cavalry next

morning, before Lee could get his forces back, to destroy

fifteen or twenty miles of the Weldon Railroad.  But misfortunes

never come singly.  I learned during that same afternoon that

Wright's pursuit of Early was feeble because of the constant and

contrary orders he had been receiving from Washington, while I

was cut off from immediate communication by reason of our cable

across Chesapeake Bay being broken.  Early, however, was not

aware of the fact that Wright was not pursuing until he had

reached Strasburg.  Finding that he was not pursued he turned

back to Winchester, where Crook was stationed with a small

force, and drove him out.  He then pushed north until he had

reached the Potomac, then he sent McCausland across to

Chambersburg, Pa., to destroy that town.  Chambersburg was a

purely defenceless town with no garrison whatever, and no

fortifications; yet McCausland, under Early's orders, burned the

place and left about three hundred families houseless.  This

occurred on the 30th of July.  I rescinded my orders for the

troops to go out to destroy the Weldon Railroad, and directed

them to embark for Washington City.  After burning Chambersburg

McCausland retreated, pursued by our cavalry, towards

Cumberland.  They were met and defeated by General Kelley and

driven into Virginia.



The Shenandoah Valley was very important to the Confederates,

because it was the principal storehouse they now had for feeding

their armies about Richmond.  It was well known that they would

make a desperate struggle to maintain it.  It had been the

source of a great deal of trouble to us heretofore to guard that

outlet to the north, partly because of the incompetency of some

of the commanders, but chiefly because of interference from

Washington.



It seemed to be the policy of General Halleck and Secretary

Stanton to keep any force sent there, in pursuit of the invading

army, moving right and left so as to keep between the enemy and

our capital; and, generally speaking, they pursued this policy

until all knowledge of the whereabouts of the enemy was lost.

They were left, therefore, free to supply themselves with

horses, beef cattle, and such provisions as they could carry

away from Western Maryland and Pennsylvania.  I determined to

put a stop to this.  I started Sheridan at once for that field

of operation, and on the following day sent another division of

his cavalry.



I had previously asked to have Sheridan assigned to that

command, but Mr. Stanton objected, on the ground that he was too

young for so important a command.  On the 1st of August when I

sent reinforcements for the protection of Washington, I sent the

following orders:





CITY POINT, VA.,



August 1, 1864, 11.30 A.M.



MAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK,

Washington D. C.



I am sending General Sheridan for temporary duty whilst the

enemy is being expelled from the border.  Unless General Hunter

is in the field in person, I want Sheridan put in command of all

the troops in the field, with instructions to put himself south

of the enemy and follow him to the death.  Wherever the enemy

goes let our troops go also.  Once started up the valley they

ought to be followed until we get possession of the Virginia

Central Railroad.  If General Hunter is in the field, give

Sheridan direct command of the 6th corps and cavalry division.

All the cavalry, I presume, will reach Washington in the course

of to-morrow.



U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.





The President in some way or other got to see this dispatch of

mine directing certain instructions to be given to the

commanders in the field, operating against Early, and sent me

the following very characteristic dispatch:





OFFICE U. S. MILITARY TELEGRAPH,

WAR DEPARTMENT,

WASHINGTON, D. C., August 3, 1864.



Cypher. 6 P.M.,



LT. GENERAL GRANT,

City Point, Va.



I have seen your despatch in which you say, "I want Sheridan put

in command of all the troops in the field, with instructions to

put himself south of the enemy, and follow him to the death.

Wherever the enemy goes, let our troops go also."  This, I

think, is exactly right, as to how our forces should move.  But

please look over the despatches you may have received from here,

even since you made that order, and discover, if you can, that

there is any idea in the head of any one here, of "putting our

army south of the enemy," or of "following him to the death" in

any direction.  I repeat to you it will neither be done nor

attempted unless you watch it every day, and hour, and force it.



A. LINCOLN.





I replied to this that "I would start in two hours for

Washington," and soon got off, going directly to the Monocacy

without stopping at Washington on my way.  I found General

Hunter's army encamped there, scattered over the fields along

the banks of the Monocacy, with many hundreds of cars and

locomotives, belonging to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, which

he had taken the precaution to bring back and collect at that

point.  I asked the general where the enemy was.  He replied

that he did not know.  He said the fact was, that he was so

embarrassed with orders from Washington moving him first to the

right and then to the left that he had lost all trace of the

enemy.



I then told the general that I would find out where the enemy

was, and at once ordered steam got up and trains made up, giving

directions to push for Halltown, some four miles above Harper's

Ferry, in the Shenandoah Valley.  The cavalry and the wagon

trains were to march, but all the troops that could be

transported by the cars were to go in that way.  I knew that the

valley was of such importance to the enemy that, no matter how

much he was scattered at that time, he would in a very short

time be found in front of our troops moving south.



I then wrote out General Hunter's instructions. (*39)  I told

him that Sheridan was in Washington, and still another division

was on its way; and suggested that he establish the headquarters

of the department at any point that would suit him best,

Cumberland, Baltimore, or elsewhere, and give Sheridan command

of the troops in the field.  The general replied to this, that

he thought he had better be relieved entirely.  He said that

General Halleck seemed so much to distrust his fitness for the

position he was in that he thought somebody else ought to be

there.  He did not want, in any way, to embarrass the cause;

thus showing a patriotism that was none too common in the

army.  There were not many major-generals who would voluntarily

have asked to have the command of a department taken from them

on the supposition that for some particular reason, or for any

reason, the service would be better performed.  I told him,

"very well then," and telegraphed at once for Sheridan to come

to the Monocacy, and suggested that I would wait and meet him

there.



Sheridan came at once by special train, but reached there after

the troops were all off.  I went to the station and remained

there until he arrived.  Myself and one or two of my staff were

about all the Union people, except General Hunter and his staff,

who were left at the Monocacy when Sheridan arrived.  I hastily

told Sheridan what had been done and what I wanted him to do,

giving him, at the same time, the written instructions which had

been prepared for General Hunter and directed to that officer.



Sheridan now had about 30,000 men to move with, 8,000 of them

being cavalry.  Early had about the same number, but the

superior ability of the National commander over the Confederate

commander was so great that all the latter's advantage of being

on the defensive was more than counterbalanced by this

circumstance.  As I had predicted, Early was soon found in front

of Sheridan in the valley, and Pennsylvania and Maryland were

speedily freed from the invaders.  The importance of the valley

was so great to the Confederates that Lee reinforced Early, but

not to the extent that we thought and feared he would.



To prevent as much as possible these reinforcements from being

sent out from Richmond, I had to do something to compel Lee to

retain his forces about his capital.  I therefore gave orders

for another move to the north side of the James River, to

threaten Richmond.  Hancock's corps, part of the 10th corps

under Birney, and Gregg's division of cavalry were crossed to

the north side of the James during the night of the 13th-14th of

August.  A threatening position was maintained for a number of

days, with more or less skirmishing, and some tolerably hard

fighting; although it was my object and my instructions that

anything like a battle should be avoided, unless opportunities

should present themselves which would insure great success.

General Meade was left in command of the few troops around

Petersburg, strongly intrenched; and was instructed to keep a

close watch upon the enemy in that quarter, and himself to take

advantage of any weakening that might occur through an effort on

the part of the enemy to reinforce the north side.  There was no

particular victory gained on either side; but during that time

no more reinforcements were sent to the valley.



I informed Sheridan of what had been done to prevent

reinforcements being sent from Richmond against him, and also

that the efforts we had made had proven that one of the

divisions which we supposed had gone to the valley was still at

Richmond, because we had captured six or seven hundred prisoners

from that division, each of its four brigades having contributed

to our list of captures.  I also informed him that but one

division had gone, and it was possible that I should be able to

prevent the going of any more.



To add to my embarrassment at this time Sherman, who was now

near Atlanta, wanted reinforcements.  He was perfectly willing

to take the raw troops then being raised in the North-west,

saying that he could teach them more soldiering in one day among

his troops than they would learn in a week in a camp of

instruction.  I therefore asked that all troops in camps of

instruction in the North-west be sent to him.  Sherman also

wanted to be assured that no Eastern troops were moving out

against him.  I informed him of what I had done and assured him

that I would hold all the troops there that it was possible for

me to hold, and that up to that time none had gone.  I also

informed him that his real danger was from Kirby Smith, who

commanded the trans-Mississippi Department.  If Smith should

escape Steele, and get across the Mississippi River, he might

move against him.  I had, therefore, asked to have an expedition

ready to move from New Orleans against Mobile in case Kirby Smith

should get across.  This would have a tendency to draw him to the

defence of that place, instead of going against Sherman.



Right in the midst of all these embarrassments Halleck informed

me that there was an organized scheme on foot in the North to

resist the draft, and suggested that it might become necessary

to draw troops from the field to put it down.  He also advised

taking in sail, and not going too fast.



The troops were withdrawn from the north side of the James River

on the night of the 20th.  Before they were withdrawn, however,

and while most of Lee's force was on that side of the river,

Warren had been sent with most of the 5th corps to capture the

Weldon Railroad.  He took up his line of march well back to the

rear, south of the enemy, while the troops remaining in the

trenches extended so as to cover that part of the line which he

had vacated by moving out.  From our left, near the old line, it

was about three miles to the Weldon Railroad.  A division was

ordered from the right of the Petersburg line to reinforce

Warren, while a division was brought back from the north side of

the James River to take its place.



This road was very important to the enemy.  The limits from

which his supplies had been drawn were already very much

contracted, and I knew that he must fight desperately to protect

it.  Warren carried the road, though with heavy loss on both

sides.  He fortified his new position, and our trenches were

then extended from the left of our main line to connect with his

new one.  Lee made repeated attempts to dislodge Warren's corps,

but without success, and with heavy loss.



As soon as Warren was fortified and reinforcements reached him,

troops were sent south to destroy the bridges on the Weldon

Railroad; and with such success that the enemy had to draw in

wagons, for a distance of about thirty miles, all the supplies

they got thereafter from that source.  It was on the 21st that

Lee seemed to have given up the Weldon Railroad as having been

lost to him; but along about the 24th or 25th he made renewed

attempts to recapture it; again he failed and with very heavy

losses to him as compared with ours.



On the night of the 20th our troops on the north side of the

James were withdrawn, and Hancock and Gregg were sent south to

destroy the Weldon Railroad.  They were attacked on the 25th at

Reams's Station, and after desperate fighting a part of our line

gave way, losing five pieces of artillery.  But the Weldon

Railroad never went out of our possession from the 18th of

August to the close of the war.
