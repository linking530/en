REPORT OF LIEUTENANT-GENERAL U. S. GRANT, OF THE UNITED STATES

ARMIES 1864-65.



HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES, WASHINGTON, D. C.,

July 22, 1865.



HON. E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War.



SIR:  I have the honor to submit the following report of the

operations of the Armies of the United States from the date of

my appointment to command the same.



From an early period in the rebellion I had been impressed with

the idea that active and continuous operations of all the troops

that could be brought into the field, regardless of season and

weather, were necessary to a speedy termination of the war.  The

resources of the enemy and his numerical strength were far

inferior to ours; but as an offset to this, we had a vast

territory, with a population hostile to the government, to

garrison, and long lines of river and railroad communications to

protect, to enable us to supply the operating armies.



The armies in the East and West acted independently and without

concert, like a balky team, no two ever pulling together,

enabling the enemy to use to great advantage his interior lines

of communication for transporting troops from East to West,

reinforcing the army most vigorously pressed, and to furlough

large numbers, during seasons of inactivity on our part, to go

to their homes and do the work of producing, for the support of

their armies.  It was a question whether our numerical strength

and resources were not more than balanced by these disadvantages

and the enemy's superior position.



From the first, I was firm in the conviction that no peace could

be had that would be stable and conducive to the happiness of the

people, both North and South, until the military power of the

rebellion was entirely broken.



I therefore determined, first, to use the greatest number of

troops practicable against the armed force of the enemy;

preventing him from using the same force at different seasons

against first one and then another of our armies, and the

possibility of repose for refitting and producing necessary

supplies for carrying on resistance.  Second, to hammer

continuously against the armed force of the enemy and his

resources, until by mere attrition, if in no other way, there

should be nothing left to him but an equal submission with the

loyal section of our common country to the constitution and laws

of the land.



These views have been kept constantly in mind, and orders given

and campaigns made to carry them out.  Whether they might have

been better in conception and execution is for the people, who

mourn the loss of friends fallen, and who have to pay the

pecuniary cost, to say.  All I can say is, that what I have done

has been done conscientiously, to the best of my ability, and in

what I conceived to be for the best interests of the whole

country.



At the date when this report begins, the situation of the

contending forces was about as follows:  The Mississippi River

was strongly garrisoned by Federal troops, from St.  Louis,

Missouri, to its mouth.  The line of the Arkansas was also held,

thus giving us armed possession of all west of the Mississippi,

north of that stream.  A few points in Southern Louisiana, not

remote from the river, were held by us, together with a small

garrison at and near the mouth of the Rio Grande.  All the

balance of the vast territory of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas

was in the almost undisputed possession of the enemy, with an

army of probably not less than eighty thousand effective men,

that could have been brought into the field had there been

sufficient opposition to have brought them out.  The let-alone

policy had demoralized this force so that probably but little

more than one-half of it was ever present in garrison at any one

time.  But the one-half, or forty thousand men, with the bands of

guerillas scattered through Missouri, Arkansas, and along the

Mississippi River, and the disloyal character of much of the

population, compelled the use of a large number of troops to

keep navigation open on the river, and to protect the loyal

people to the west of it.  To the east of the Mississippi we

held substantially with the line of the Tennessee and Holston

rivers, running eastward to include nearly all of the State of

Tennessee.  South of Chattanooga, a small foothold had been

obtained in Georgia, sufficient to protect East Tennessee from

incursions from the enemy's force at Dalton, Georgia. West

Virginia was substantially within our lines.  Virginia, with the

exception of the northern border, the Potomac River, a small area

about the mouth of James River, covered by the troops at Norfolk

and Fort Monroe, and the territory covered by the Army of the

Potomac lying along the Rapidan, was in the possession of the

enemy.  Along the sea-coast footholds had been obtained at

Plymouth, Washington, and New Bern, in North Carolina; Beaufort,

Folly and Morris Islands, Hilton Head, Fort Pulaski, and Port

Royal, in South Carolina; Fernandina and St. Augustine, in

Florida. Key West and Pensacola were also in our possession,

while all the important ports were blockaded by the navy.  The

accompanying map , a copy of which was sent to General Sherman

and other commanders in March, 1864, shows by red lines the

territory occupied by us at the beginning of the rebellion, and

at the opening of the campaign of 1864, while those in blue are

the lines which it was proposed to occupy.



Behind the Union lines there were many bands of guerillas and a

large population disloyal to the government, making it necessary

to guard every foot of road or river used in supplying our

armies.  In the South, a reign of military despotism prevailed,

which made every man and boy capable of bearing arms a soldier;

and those who could not bear arms in the field acted as provosts

for collecting deserters and returning them.  This enabled the

enemy to bring almost his entire strength into the field.



The enemy had concentrated the bulk of his forces east of the

Mississippi into two armies, commanded by Generals R. E. Lee and

J. E. Johnston, his ablest and best generals.  The army commanded

by Lee occupied the south bank of the Rapidan, extending from

Mine Run westward, strongly intrenched, covering and defending

Richmond, the rebel capital, against the Army of the Potomac.

The army under Johnston occupied a strongly intrenched position

at Dalton, Georgia, covering and defending Atlanta, Georgia, a

place of great importance as a railroad centre, against the

armies under Major-General W. T. Sherman.  In addition to these

armies he had a large cavalry force under Forrest, in North-east

Mississippi; a considerable force, of all arms, in the Shenandoah

Valley, and in the western part of Virginia and extreme eastern

part of Tennessee; and also confronting our sea-coast garrisons,

and holding blockaded ports where we had no foothold upon land.



These two armies, and the cities covered and defended by them,

were the main objective points of the campaign.



Major-General W. T. Sherman, who was appointed to the command of

the Military Division of the Mississippi, embracing all the

armies and territory east of the Mississippi River to the

Alleghanies and the Department of Arkansas, west of the

Mississippi, had the immediate command of the armies operating

against Johnston.



Major-General George G. Meade had the immediate command of the

Army of the Potomac, from where I exercised general supervision

of the movements of all our armies.



General Sherman was instructed to move against Johnston's army,

to break it up, and to go into the interior of the enemy's

country as far as he could, inflicting all the damage he could

upon their war resources.  If the enemy in his front showed

signs of joining Lee, to follow him up to the full extent of his

ability, while I would prevent the concentration of Lee upon him,

if it was in the power of the Army of the Potomac to do so.  More

specific written instructions were not given, for the reason that

I had talked over with him the plans of the campaign, and was

satisfied that he understood them and would execute them to the

fullest extent possible.



Major-General N. P. Banks, then on an expedition up Red River

against Shreveport, Louisiana (which had been organized previous

to my appointment to command), was notified by me on the 15th of

March, of the importance it was that Shreveport should be taken

at the earliest possible day, and that if he found that the

taking of it would occupy from ten to fifteen days' more time

than General Sherman had given his troops to be absent from

their command, he would send them back at the time specified by

General Sherman, even if it led to the abandonment of the main

object of the Red River expedition, for this force was necessary

to movements east of the Mississippi; that should his expedition

prove successful, he would hold Shreveport and the Red River

with such force as he might deem necessary, and return the

balance of his troops to the neighborhood of New Orleans,

commencing no move for the further acquisition of territory,

unless it was to make that then held by him more easily held;

that it might be a part of the spring campaign to move against

Mobile; that it certainly would be, if troops enough could be

obtained to make it without embarrassing other movements; that

New Orleans would be the point of departure for such an

expedition; also, that I had directed General Steele to make a

real move from Arkansas, as suggested by him (General Banks),

instead of a demonstration, as Steele thought advisable.



On the 31st of March, in addition to the foregoing notification

and directions, he was instructed as follows:





"1st.  If successful in your expedition against Shreveport, that

you turn over the defence of the Red River to General Steele and

the navy.



"2d.  That you abandon Texas entirely, with the exception of

your hold upon the Rio Grande.  This can be held with four

thousand men, if they will turn their attention immediately to

fortifying their positions.  At least one-half of the force

required for this service might be taken from the colored troops.



"3d.  By properly fortifying on the Mississippi River, the force

to guard it from Port Hudson to New Orleans can be reduced to ten

thousand men, if not to a less number.  Six thousand more would

then hold all the rest of the territory necessary to hold until

active operations can again be resumed west of the river.

According to your last return, this would give you a force of

over thirty thousand effective men with which to move against

Mobile.  To this I expect to add five thousand men from

Missouri.  If however, you think the force here stated too small

to hold the territory regarded as necessary to hold possession

of, I would say concentrate at least twenty-five thousand men of

your present command for operations against Mobile.  With these

and such additions as I can give you from elsewhere, lose no

time in making a demonstration, to be followed by an attack upon

Mobile.  Two or more iron-clads will be ordered to report to

Admiral Farragut.  This gives him a strong naval fleet with

which to co-operate.  You can make your own arrangements with

the admiral for his co-operation, and select your own line of

approach.  My own idea of the matter is that Pascagoula should

be your base; but, from your long service in the Gulf

Department, you will know best about the matter.  It is intended

that your movements shall be co-operative with movements

elsewhere, and you cannot now start too soon.  All I would now

add is, that you commence the concentration of your forces at

once.  Preserve a profound secrecy of what you intend doing, and

start at the earliest possible moment.

"MAJOR-GENERAL N. P. BANKS."





Major-General Meade was instructed that Lee's army would be his

objective point; that wherever Lee went he would go also.  For

his movement two plans presented themselves:  One to cross the

Rapidan below Lee, moving by his right flank; the other above,

moving by his left.  Each presented advantages over the other,

with corresponding objections.  By crossing above, Lee would be

cut off from all chance of ignoring Richmond or going north on a

raid.  But if we took this route, all we did would have to be

done whilst the rations we started with held out; besides, it

separated us from Butler, so that he could not be directed how

to cooperate.  If we took the other route, Brandy Station could

be used as a base of supplies until another was secured on the

York or James rivers.  Of these, however, it was decided to take

the lower route.



The following letter of instruction was addressed to

Major-General B. F. Butler:





"FORT MONROE, VIRGINIA, April 2, 1864.



"GENERAL:-In the spring campaign, which it is desirable shall

commence at as early a day as practicable, it is proposed to

have cooperative action of all the armies in the field, as far

as this object can be accomplished.



"It will not be possible to unite our armies into two or three

large ones to act as so many units, owing to the absolute

necessity of holding on to the territory already taken from the

enemy.  But, generally speaking, concentration can be

practically effected by armies moving to the interior of the

enemy's country from the territory they have to guard.  By such

movement, they interpose themselves between the enemy and the

country to be guarded, thereby reducing the number necessary to

guard important points, or at least occupy the attention of a

part of the enemy's force, if no greater object is gained. Lee's

army and Richmond being the greater objects towards which our

attention must be directed in the next campaign, it is desirable

to unite all the force we can against them.  The necessity of

covering Washington with the Army of the Potomac, and of

covering your department with your army, makes it impossible to

unite these forces at the beginning of any move. I propose,

therefore, what comes nearest this of anything that seems

practicable:  The Army of the Potomac will act from its present

base, Lee's army being the objective point.  You will collect

all the forces from your command that can be spared from

garrison duty--I should say not less than twenty thousand

effective men--to operate on the south side of James River,

Richmond being your objective point.  To the force you already

have will be added about ten thousand men from South Carolina,

under Major-General Gillmore, who will command them in person.

Major-General W. F. Smith is ordered to report to you, to

command the troops sent into the field from your own department.



"General Gillmore will be ordered to report to you at Fortress

Monroe, with all the troops on transports, by the 18th instant,

or as soon thereafter as practicable.  Should you not receive

notice by that time to move, you will make such disposition of

them and your other forces as you may deem best calculated to

deceive the enemy as to the real move to be made.



"When you are notified to move, take City Point with as much

force as possible.  Fortify, or rather intrench, at once, and

concentrate all your troops for the field there as rapidly as

you can.  From City Point directions cannot be given at this

time for your further movements.



"The fact that has already been stated--that is, that Richmond

is to be your objective point, and that there is to be

co-operation between your force and the Army of the

Potomac--must be your guide.  This indicates the necessity of

your holding close to the south bank of the James River as you

advance.  Then, should the enemy be forced into his

intrenchments in Richmond, the Army of the Potomac would follow,

and by means of transports the two armies would become a unit.



"All the minor details of your advance are left entirely to your

direction. If, however, you think it practicable to use your

cavalry south of you, so as to cut the railroad about Hicksford,

about the time of the general advance, it would be of immense

advantage.



"You will please forward for my information, at the earliest

practicable day, all orders, details, and instructions you may

give for the execution of this order.



"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.

"MAJOR-GENERAL B. F. BUTLER."





On the 16th these instructions were substantially reiterated. On

the 19th, in order to secure full co-operation between his army

and that of General Meade, he was informed that I expected him

to move from Fort Monroe the same day that General Meade moved

from Culpeper.  The exact time I was to telegraph him as soon as

it was fixed, and that it would not be earlier than the 27th of

April; that it was my intention to fight Lee between Culpeper

and Richmond, if he would stand.  Should he, however, fall back

into Richmond, I would follow up and make a junction with his

(General Butler's) army on the James River; that, could I be

certain he would be able to invest Richmond on the south side,

so as to have his left resting on the James, above the city, I

would form the junction there; that circumstances might make

this course advisable anyhow; that he should use every exertion

to secure footing as far up the south side of the river as he

could, and as soon as possible after the receipt of orders to

move; that if he could not carry the city, he should at least

detain as large a force there as possible.



In co-operation with the main movements against Lee and

Johnston, I was desirous of using all other troops necessarily

kept in departments remote from the fields of immediate

operations, and also those kept in the background for the

protection of our extended lines between the loyal States and

the armies operating against them.



A very considerable force, under command of Major-General Sigel,

was so held for the protection of West Virginia, and the

frontiers of Maryland and Pennsylvania.  Whilst these troops

could not be withdrawn to distant fields without exposing the

North to invasion by comparatively small bodies of the enemy,

they could act directly to their front, and give better

protection than if lying idle in garrison.  By such a movement

they would either compel the enemy to detach largely for the

protection of his supplies and lines of communication, or he

would lose them.  General Sigel was therefore directed to

organize all his available force into two expeditions, to move

from Beverly and Charleston, under command of Generals Ord and

Crook, against the East Tennessee and Virginia Railroad.

Subsequently, General Ord having been relieved at his own

request, General Sigel was instructed at his own suggestion, to

give up the expedition by Beverly, and to form two columns, one

under General Crook, on the Kanawha, numbering about ten

thousand men, and one on the Shenandoah, numbering about seven

thousand men.  The one on the Shenandoah to assemble between

Cumberland and the Shenandoah, and the infantry and artillery

advanced to Cedar Creek with such cavalry as could be made

available at the moment, to threaten the enemy in the Shenandoah

Valley, and advance as far as possible; while General Crook would

take possession of Lewisburg with part of his force and move down

the Tennessee Railroad, doing as much damage as he could,

destroying the New River Bridge and the salt-works, at

Saltville, Va.



Owing to the weather and bad condition of the roads, operations

were delayed until the 1st of May, when, everything being in

readiness and the roads favorable, orders were given for a

general movement of all the armies not later than the 4th of May.



My first object being to break the military power of the

rebellion, and capture the enemy's important strongholds, made

me desirous that General Butler should succeed in his movement

against Richmond, as that would tend more than anything else,

unless it were the capture of Lee's army, to accomplish this

desired result in the East. If he failed, it was my

determination, by hard fighting, either to compel Lee to

retreat, or to so cripple him that he could not detach a large

force to go north, and still retain enough for the defence of

Richmond.  It was well understood, by both Generals Butler and

Meade, before starting en the campaign, that it was my intention

to put both their armies south of the James River, in case of

failure to destroy Lee without it.



Before giving General Butler his instructions, I visited him at

Fort Monroe, and in conversation pointed out the apparent

importance of getting possession of Petersburg, and destroying

railroad communication as far south as possible.  Believing,

however, in the practicability of capturing Richmond unless it

was reinforced, I made that the objective point of his

operations.  As the Army of the Potomac was to move

simultaneously with him, Lee could not detach from his army with

safety, and the enemy did not have troops elsewhere to bring to

the defence of the city in time to meet a rapid movement from

the north of James River.



I may here state that, commanding all the armies as I did, I

tried, as far as possible, to leave General Meade in independent

command of the Army of the Potomac.  My instructions for that

army were all through him, and were general in their nature,

leaving all the details and the execution to him.  The campaigns

that followed proved him to be the right man in the right

place.  His commanding always in the presence of an officer

superior to him in rank, has drawn from him much of that public

attention that his zeal and ability entitle him to, and which he

would otherwise have received.



The movement of the Army of the Potomac commenced early on the

morning of the 4th of May, under the immediate direction and

orders of Major-General Meade, pursuant to instructions.  Before

night, the whole army was across the Rapidan (the fifth and sixth

corps crossing at Germania Ford, and the second corps at Ely's

Ford, the cavalry, under Major-General Sheridan, moving in

advance,) with the greater part of its trains, numbering about

four thousand wagons, meeting with but slight opposition.  The

average distance travelled by the troops that day was about

twelve miles.  This I regarded as a great success, and it

removed from my mind the most serious apprehensions I had

entertained, that of crossing the river in the face of an

active, large, well-appointed, and ably commanded army, and how

so large a train was to be carried through a hostile country,

and protected.  Early on the 5th, the advance corps (the fifth,

Major-General G. K. Warren commanding) met and engaged the enemy

outside his intrenchments near Mine Run.  The battle raged

furiously all day, the whole army being brought into the fight

as fast as the corps could be got upon the field, which,

considering the density of the forest and narrowness of the

roads, was done with commendable promptness.



General Burnside, with the ninth corps, was, at the time the

Army of the Potomac moved, left with the bulk of his corps at

the crossing of the Rappahannock River and Alexandria Railroad,

holding the road back to Bull Run, with instructions not to move

until he received notice that a crossing of the Rapidan was

secured, but to move promptly as soon as such notice was

received.  This crossing he was apprised of on the afternoon of

the 4th.  By six o'clock of the morning of the 6th he was

leading his corps into action near the Wilderness Tavern, some

of his troops having marched a distance of over thirty miles,

crossing both the Rappahannock and Rapidan rivers.  Considering

that a large proportion, probably two-thirds of his command, was

composed of new troops, unaccustomed to marches, and carrying the

accoutrements of a soldier, this was a remarkable march.



The battle of the Wilderness was renewed by us at five o'clock

on the morning of the 6th, and continued with unabated fury

until darkness set in, each army holding substantially the same

position that they had on the evening of the 5th.  After dark,

the enemy made a feeble attempt to turn our right flank,

capturing several hundred prisoners and creating considerable

confusion.  But the promptness of General Sedgwick, who was

personally present and commanded that part of our line, soon

reformed it and restored order.  On the morning of the 7th,

reconnoissances showed that the enemy had fallen behind his

intrenched lines, with pickets to the front, covering a part of

the battle-field.  From this it was evident to my mind that the

two days' fighting had satisfied him of his inability to further

maintain the contest in the open field, notwithstanding his

advantage of position, and that he would wait an attack behind

his works. I therefore determined to push on and put my whole

force between him and Richmond; and orders were at once issued

for a movement by his right flank.  On the night of the 7th, the

march was commenced towards Spottsylvania Court House, the fifth

corps moving on the most direct road.  But the enemy having

become apprised of our movement, and having the shorter line,

was enabled to reach there first.  On the 8th, General Warren

met a force of the enemy, which had been sent out to oppose and

delay his advance, to gain time to fortify the line taken up at

Spottsylvania.  This force was steadily driven back on the main

force, within the recently constructed works, after considerable

fighting, resulting in severe loss to both sides.  On the morning

of the 9th, General Sheridan started on a raid against the

enemy's lines of communication with Richmond.  The 9th, 10th,

and 11th were spent in manoeuvring and fighting, without

decisive results.  Among the killed on the 9th was that able and

distinguished soldier Major-General John Sedgwick, commanding the

sixth army corps.  Major-General H. G. Wright succeeded him in

command.  Early on the morning of the 12th a general attack was

made on the enemy in position.  The second corps, Major-General

Hancock commanding, carried a salient of his line, capturing

most of Johnson's division of Ewell's corps and twenty pieces of

artillery.  But the resistance was so obstinate that the

advantage gained did not prove decisive.  The 13th, 14th, 15th,

16th, 17th, and 18th, were consumed in manoeuvring and awaiting

the arrival of reinforcements from Washington.  Deeming it

impracticable to make any further attack upon the enemy at

Spottsylvania Court House, orders were issued on the 15th with a

view to a movement to the North Anna, to commence at twelve

o'clock on the night of the 19th.  Late in the afternoon of the

19th, Ewell's corps came out of its works on our extreme right

flank; but the attack was promptly repulsed, with heavy loss.

This delayed the movement to the North Anna until the night of

the 21st, when it was commenced.  But the enemy again, having

the shorter line, and being in possession of the main roads, was

enabled to reach the North Anna in advance of us, and took

position behind it.  The fifth corps reached the North Anna on

the afternoon of the 23d, closely followed by the sixth corps.

The second and ninth corps got up about the same time, the

second holding the railroad bridge, and the ninth lying between

that and Jericho Ford.  General Warren effected a crossing the

same afternoon, and got a position without much opposition. Soon

after getting into position he was violently attacked, but

repulsed the enemy with great slaughter.  On the 25th, General

Sheridan rejoined the Army of the Potomac from the raid on which

he started from Spottsylvania, having destroyed the depots at

Beaver Dam and Ashland stations, four trains of cars, large

supplies of rations, and many miles of railroad-track;

recaptured about four hundred of our men on their way to

Richmond as prisoners of war; met and defeated the enemy's

cavalry at Yellow Tavern; carried the first line of works around

Richmond (but finding the second line too strong to be carried by

assault), recrossed to the north bank of the Chickahominy at

Meadow Bridge under heavy fire, and moved by a detour to

Haxall's Landing, on the James River, where he communicated with

General Butler.  This raid had the effect of drawing off the

whole of the enemy's cavalry force, making it comparatively easy

to guard our trains.



General Butler moved his main force up the James River, in

pursuance of instructions, on the 4th of May, General Gillmore

having joined him with the tenth corps.  At the same time he

sent a force of one thousand eight hundred cavalry, by way of

West Point, to form a junction with him wherever he might get a

foothold, and a force of three thousand cavalry, under General

Kautz, from Suffolk, to operate against the road south of

Petersburg and Richmond.  On the 5th, he occupied, without

opposition, both City Point and Bermuda Hundred, his movement

being a complete surprise.  On the 6th, he was in position with

his main army, and commenced intrenching.  On the 7th he made a

reconnoissance against the Petersburg and Richmond Railroad,

destroying a portion of it after some fighting.  On the 9th he

telegraphed as follows:





"HEADQUARTERS, NEAR BERMUDA LANDING,

May 9, 1864.



"HON. E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War.



"Our operations may be summed up in a few words.  With one

thousand seven hundred cavalry we have advanced up the

Peninsula, forced the Chickahominy, and have safely, brought

them to their present position.  These were colored cavalry, and

are now holding our advance pickets towards Richmond.



"General Kautz, with three thousand cavalry from Suffolk, on the

same day with our movement up James River, forced the Black

Water, burned the railroad bridge at Stony Creek, below

Petersburg, cutting into Beauregard's force at that point.



"We have landed here, intrenched ourselves, destroyed many miles

of railroad, and got a position which, with proper supplies, we

can hold out against the whole of Lee's army.  I have ordered up

the supplies.



"Beauregard, with a large portion of his force, was left south

by the cutting of the railroads by Kautz.  That portion which

reached Petersburg under Hill I have whipped to-day, killing and

wounding many, and taking many prisoners, after a severe and

well-contested fight.



"General Grant will not be troubled with any further

reinforcements to Lee from Beauregard's force.



"BENJ. F. BUTLER, Major-General."





On the evening of the 13th and morning of the 14th he carried a

portion of the enemy's first line of defences at Drury's Bluff,

or Fort Darling, with small loss.  The time thus consumed from

the 6th lost to us the benefit of the surprise and capture of

Richmond and Petersburg, enabling, as it did, Beauregard to

collect his loose forces in North and South Carolina, and bring

them to the defence of those places.  On the 16th, the enemy

attacked General Butler in his position in front of Drury's

Bluff.  He was forced back, or drew back, into his intrenchments

between the forks of the James and Appomattox rivers, the enemy

intrenching strongly in his front, thus covering his railroads,

the city, and all that was valuable to him.  His army,

therefore, though in a position of great security, was as

completely shut off from further operations directly against

Richmond as if it had been in a bottle strongly corked.  It

required but a comparatively small force of the enemy to hold it

there.



On the 12th, General Kautz, with his cavalry, was started on a

raid against the Danville Railroad, which he struck at

Coalfield, Powhatan, and Chula Stations, destroying them, the

railroad-track, two freight trains, and one locomotive, together

with large quantities of commissary and other stores; thence,

crossing to the South Side Road, struck it at Wilson's,

Wellsville, and Black's and White's Stations, destroying the

road and station-houses; thence he proceeded to City Point,

which he reached on the 18th.



On the 19th of April, and prior to the movement of General

Butler, the enemy, with a land force under General Hoke and an

iron-clad ram, attacked Plymouth, N. C., commanded by General H.

W. Wessells, and our gunboats there, and, after severe fighting,

the place was carried by assault, and the entire garrison and

armament captured.  The gunboat Smithfield was sunk, and the

Miami disabled.



The army sent to operate against Richmond having hermetically

sealed itself up at Bermuda Hundred, the enemy was enabled to

bring the most, if not all, the reinforcements brought from the

south by Beauregard against the Army of the Potomac. In addition

to this reinforcement, a very considerable one, probably not less

than fifteen thousand men, was obtained by calling in the

scattered troops under Breckinridge from the western part of

Virginia.



The position of Bermuda Hundred was as easy to defend as it was

difficult to operate from against the enemy.  I determined,

therefore, to bring from it all available forces, leaving enough

only to secure what had been gained; and accordingly, on the 22d,

I directed that they be sent forward, under command of

Major-General W. F. Smith, to join the Army of the Potomac.



On the 24th of May, the 9th army corps, commanded by

Major-General A. E. Burnside, was assigned to the Army of the

Potomac, and from this time forward constituted a portion of

Major-General Meade's command.



Finding the enemy's position on the North Anna stronger than

either of his previous ones, I withdrew on the night of the 26th

to the north bank of the North Anna, and moved via Hanover Town

to turn the enemy's position by his right.



Generals Torbert's and Merritt's divisions of cavalry, under

Sheridan, and the 6th corps, led the advance, crossed the

Pamunkey River at Hanover Town, after considerable fighting, and

on the 28th the two divisions of cavalry had a severe, but

successful engagement with the enemy at Hawes's Shop.  On the

29th and 30th we advanced, with heavy skirmishing, to the

Hanover Court House and Cold Harbor Road, and developed the

enemy's position north of the Chickahominy.  Late on the evening

of the last day the enemy came out and attacked our left, but was

repulsed with very considerable loss.  An attack was immediately

ordered by General Meade, along his whole line, which resulted

in driving the enemy from a part of his intrenched skirmish line.



On the 31st, General Wilson's division of cavalry destroyed the

railroad bridges over the South Anna River, after defeating the

enemy's cavalry.  General Sheridan, on the same day, reached

Cold Harbor, and held it until relieved by the 6th corps and

General Smith's command, which had just arrived, via White

House, from General Butler's army.



On the 1st day of June an attack was made at five P.M. by the

6th corps and the troops under General Smith, the other corps

being held in readiness to advance on the receipt of orders.

This resulted in our carrying and holding the enemy's first line

of works in front of the right of the 6th corps, and in front of

General Smith.  During the attack the enemy made repeated

assaults on each of the corps not engaged in the main attack,

but was repulsed with heavy loss in every instance.  That night

he made several assaults to regain what he had lost in the day,

but failed.  The 2d was spent in getting troops into position

for an attack on the 3d.  On the 3d of June we again assaulted

the enemy's works, in the hope of driving him from his

position.  In this attempt our loss was heavy, while that of the

enemy, I have reason to believe, was comparatively light.  It was

the only general attack made from the Rapidan to the James which

did not inflict upon the enemy losses to compensate for our own

losses.  I would not be understood as saying that all previous

attacks resulted in victories to our arms, or accomplished as

much as I had hoped from them; but they inflicted upon the enemy

severe losses, which tended, in the end, to the complete

overthrow of the rebellion.



From the proximity of the enemy to his defences around Richmond,

it was impossible, by any flank movement, to interpose between

him and the city.  I was still in a condition to either move by

his left flank, and invest Richmond from the north side, or

continue my move by his right flank to the south side of the

James.  While the former might have been better as a covering

for Washington, yet a full survey of all the ground satisfied me

that it would be impracticable to hold a line north and east of

Richmond that would protect the Fredericksburg Railroad, a long,

vulnerable line, which would exhaust much of our strength to

guard, and that would have to be protected to supply the army,

and would leave open to the enemy all his lines of communication

on the south side of the James.  My idea, from the start, had

been to beat Lee's army north of Richmond, if possible.  Then,

after destroying his lines of communication north of the James

River, to transfer the army to the south side, and besiege Lee

in Richmond, or follow him south if he should retreat.  After

the battle of the Wilderness, it was evident that the enemy

deemed it of the first importance to run no risks with the army

he then had.  He acted purely on the defensive, behind

breastworks, or feebly on the offensive immediately in front of

them, and where, in case of repulse, he could easily retire

behind them.  Without a greater sacrifice of life than I was

willing to make, all could not be accomplished that I had

designed north of Richmond.  I therefore determined to continue

to hold substantially the ground we then occupied, taking

advantage of any favorable circumstances that might present

themselves, until the cavalry could be sent to Charlottesville

and Gordonsville to effectually break up the railroad connection

between Richmond and the Shenandoah Valley and Lynchburg; and

when the cavalry  got well off, to move the army to the south

side of the James River, by the enemy's right flank, where I

felt I could cut off all his sources of supply, except by the

canal.



On the 7th, two divisions of cavalry, under General Sheridan,

got off on the expedition against the Virginia Central Railroad,

with instructions to Hunter, whom I hoped he would meet near

Charlottesville, to join his forces to Sheridan's, and after the

work laid out for them was thoroughly done, to join the Army of

the Potomac by the route laid down in Sheridan's instructions.



On the 10th of June, General Butler sent a force of infantry,

under General Gillmore, and of cavalry under General Kautz, to

capture Petersburg, if possible, and destroy the railroad and

common bridges across the Appomattox.  The cavalry carried the

works on the south side, and penetrated well in towards the

town, but were forced to retire.  General Gillmore, finding the

works which he approached very strong, and deeming an assault

impracticable, returned to Bermuda Hundred without attempting

one.



Attaching great importance to the possession of Petersburg, I

sent back to Bermuda Hundred and City Point, General Smith's

command by water, via the White House, to reach there in advance

of the Army of the Potomac.  This was for the express purpose of

securing Petersburg before the enemy, becoming aware of our

intention, could reinforce the place.



The movement from Cold Harbor commenced after dark on the

evening of the 12th.  One division of cavalry, under General

Wilson, and the 5th corps, crossed the Chickahominy at Long

Bridge, and moved out to White Oak Swamp, to cover the crossings

of the other corps.  The advance corps reached James River, at

Wilcox's Landing and Charles City Court House, on the night of

the 13th.



During three long years the Armies of the Potomac and Northern

Virginia had been confronting each other.  In that time they had

fought more desperate battles than it probably ever before fell

to the lot of two armies to fight, without materially changing

the vantage ground of either.  The Southern press and people,

with more shrewdness than was displayed in the North, finding

that they had failed to capture Washington and march on to New

York, as they had boasted they would do, assumed that they only

defended their Capital and Southern territory.  Hence, Antietam,

Gettysburg, and all the other battles that had been fought, were

by them set down as failures on our part, and victories for

them.  Their army believed this.  It produced a morale which

could only be overcome by desperate and continuous hard

fighting.  The battles of the Wilderness, Spottsylvania, North

Anna and Cold Harbor, bloody and terrible as they were on our

side, were even more damaging to the enemy, and so crippled him

as to make him wary ever after of taking the offensive.  His

losses in men were probably not so great, owing to the fact that

we were, save in the Wilderness, almost invariably the attacking

party; and when he did attack, it was in the open field.  The

details of these battles, which for endurance and bravery on the

part of the soldiery, have rarely been surpassed, are given in

the report of Major-General Meade, and the subordinate reports

accompanying it.



During the campaign of forty-three days, from the Rapidan to the

James River, the army had to be supplied from an ever-shifting

base, by wagons, over narrow roads, through a densely wooded

country, with a lack of wharves at each new base from which to

conveniently discharge vessels.  Too much credit cannot,

therefore, be awarded to the quartermaster and commissary

departments for the zeal and efficiency displayed by them. Under

the general supervision of the chief quartermaster,

Brigadier-General R. Ingalls, the trains were made to occupy all

the available roads between the army and our water-base, and but

little difficulty was experienced in protecting them.



The movement in the Kanawha and Shenandoah valleys, under

General Sigel, commenced on the 1st of May.  General Crook, who

had the immediate command of the Kanawha expedition, divided his

forces into two columns, giving one, composed of cavalry, to

General Averell.  They crossed the mountains by separate routes.

Averell struck the Tennessee and Virginia Railroad, near

Wytheville, on the 10th, and proceeding to New River and

Christiansburg, destroyed the road, several important bridges

and depots, including New River Bridge, forming a junction with

Crook at Union on the 15th.  General Sigel moved up the

Shenandoah Valley, met the enemy at New Market on the 15th, and,

after a severe engagement, was defeated with heavy loss, and

retired behind Cedar Creek.  Not regarding the operations of

General Sigel as satisfactory, I asked his removal from command,

and Major-General Hunter appointed to supersede him.  His

instructions were embraced in the following dispatches to

Major-General H. W. Halleck, chief of staff of the army:





"NEAR SPOTTSYLVANIA COURT HOUSE, VA.

May 20, 1864.



        *        *        *        *        *        *        *

"The enemy are evidently relying for supplies greatly on such as

are brought over the branch road running through Staunton.  On

the whole, therefore, I think it would be better for General

Hunter to move in that direction; reach Staunton and

Gordonsville or Charlottesville, if he does not meet too much

opposition.  If he can hold at bay a force equal to his own, he

will be doing good service.  * * *



"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.

"MAJOR-GENERAL H. W. HALLECK."





JERICHO FORD, VA., May 25, 1864.



"If Hunter can possibly get to Charlottesville and Lynchburg, he

should do so, living on the country.  The railroads and canal

should be destroyed beyond possibility of repairs for weeks.

Completing this, he could find his way back to his original

base, or from about Gordonsville join this army.



"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.

"MAJOR-GENERAL H. W. HALLECK."





General Hunter immediately took up the offensive, and, moving up

the Shenandoah Valley, met the enemy on the 5th of June at

Piedmont, and, after a battle of ten hours, routed and defeated

him, capturing on the field of battle one thousand five hundred

men, three pieces of artillery, and three hundred stand of small

arms.  On the 8th of the same month he formed a junction with

Crook and Averell at Staunton, from which place he moved direct

on Lynchburg, via Lexington, which place he reached and invested

on the 16th day of June.  Up to this time he was very successful;

and but for the difficulty of taking with him sufficient ordnance

stores over so long a march, through a hostile country, he would,

no doubt, have captured that, to the enemy important, point.  The

destruction of the enemy's supplies and manufactories was very

great.  To meet this movement under General Hunter, General Lee

sent a force, perhaps equal to a corps, a part of which reached

Lynchburg a short time before Hunter.  After some skirmishing on

the 17th and 18th, General Hunter, owing to a want of ammunition

to give battle, retired from before the place.  Unfortunately,

this want of ammunition left him no choice of route for his

return but by way of Kanawha. This lost to us the use of his

troops for several weeks from the defence of the North.



Had General Hunter moved by way of Charlottesville, instead of

Lexington, as his instructions contemplated, he would have been

in a position to have covered the Shenandoah Valley against the

enemy, should the force he met have seemed to endanger it.  If

it did not, he would have been within easy distance of the James

River Canal, on the main line of communication between Lynchburg

and the force sent for its defence.  I have never taken

exception to the operations of General Hunter, and am not now

disposed to find fault with him, for I have no doubt he acted

within what he conceived to be the spirit of his instructions

and the interests of the service.  The promptitude of his

movements and his gallantry should entitle him to the

commendation of his country.



To return to the Army of the Potomac:  The 2d corps commenced

crossing the James River on the morning of the 14th by

ferry-boats at Wilcox's Landing.  The laying of the pontoon-

bridge was completed about midnight of the 14th, and the

crossing of the balance of the army was rapidly pushed forward

by both bridge and ferry.



After the crossing had commenced, I proceeded by steamer to

Bermuda Hundred to give the necessary orders for the immediate

capture of Petersburg.



The instructions to General Butler were verbal, and were for him

to send General Smith immediately, that night, with all the

troops he could give him without sacrificing the position he

then held.  I told him that I would return at once to the Army

of the Potomac, hasten its crossing and throw it forward to

Petersburg by divisions as rapidly as it could be done, that we

could reinforce our armies more rapidly there than the enemy

could bring troops against us.  General Smith got off as

directed, and confronted the enemy's pickets near Petersburg

before daylight next morning, but for some reason that I have

never been able to satisfactorily understand, did not get ready

to assault his main lines until near sundown.  Then, with a part

of his command only, he made the assault, and carried the lines

north-east of Petersburg from the Appomattox River, for a

distance of over two and a half miles, capturing fifteen pieces

of artillery and three hundred prisoners.  This was about seven

P.M. Between the line thus captured and Petersburg there were no

other works, and there was no evidence that the enemy had

reinforced Petersburg with a single brigade from any source. The

night was clear the moon shining brightly and favorable to

further operations.  General Hancock, with two divisions of the

2d corps, reached General Smith just after dark, and offered the

service of these troops as he (Smith) might wish, waiving rank to

the named commander, who he naturally supposed knew best the

position of affairs, and what to do with the troops.  But

instead of taking these troops and pushing at once into

Petersburg, he requested General Hancock to relieve a part of

his line in the captured works, which was done before midnight.



By the time I arrived the next morning the enemy was in force.

An attack was ordered to be made at six o'clock that evening by

the troops under Smith and the 2d and 9th corps.  It required

until that time for the 9th corps to get up and into position.

The attack was made as ordered, and the fighting continued with

but little intermission until six o'clock the next morning, and

resulted in our carrying the advance and some of the main works

of the enemy to the right (our left) of those previously

captured by General Smith, several pieces of artillery, and over

four hundred prisoners.



The 5th corps having got up, the attacks were renewed and

persisted in with great vigor on the 17th and 18th, but only

resulted in forcing the enemy into an interior line, from which

he could not be dislodged.  The advantages of position gained by

us were very great.  The army then proceeded to envelop

Petersburg towards the South Side Railroad as far as possible

without attacking fortifications.



On the 16th the enemy, to reinforce Petersburg, withdrew from a

part of his intrenchment in front of Bermuda Hundred, expecting,

no doubt, to get troops from north of the James to take the place

of those withdrawn before we could discover it.  General Butler,

taking advantage of this, at once moved a force on the railroad

between Petersburg and Richmond.  As soon as I was apprised of

the advantage thus gained, to retain it I ordered two divisions

of the 6th corps, General Wright commanding, that were embarking

at Wilcox's Landing, under orders for City Point, to report to

General Butler at Bermuda Hundred, of which General Butler was

notified, and the importance of holding a position in advance of

his present line urged upon him.



About two o'clock in the afternoon General Butler was forced

back to the line the enemy had withdrawn from in the morning.

General Wright, with his two divisions, joined General Butler on

the forenoon of the 17th, the latter still holding with a strong

picket-line the enemy's works.  But instead of putting these

divisions into the enemy's works to hold them, he permitted them

to halt and rest some distance in the rear of his own line.

Between four and five o'clock in the afternoon the enemy

attacked and drove in his pickets and re-occupied his old line.



On the night of the 20th and morning of the 21st a lodgment was

effected by General Butler, with one brigade of infantry, on the

north bank of the James, at Deep Bottom, and connected by

pontoon-bridge with Bermuda Hundred.



On the 19th, General Sheridan, on his return from his expedition

against the Virginia Central Railroad, arrived at the White House

just as the enemy's cavalry was about to attack it, and compelled

it to retire.  The result of this expedition was, that General

Sheridan met the enemy's cavalry near Trevilian Station, on the

morning of the 11th of June, whom he attacked, and after an

obstinate contest drove from the field in complete rout.  He

left his dead and nearly all his wounded in our hands, and about

four hundred prisoners and several hundred horses.  On the 12th

he destroyed the railroad from Trevilian Station to Louisa Court

House.  This occupied until three o'clock P.M., when he advanced

in the direction of Gordonsville.  He found the enemy reinforced

by infantry, behind well-constructed rifle-pits, about five miles

from the latter place and too strong to successfully assault.  On

the extreme right, however, his reserve brigade carried the

enemy's works twice, and was twice driven therefrom by

infantry.  Night closed the contest.  Not having sufficient

ammunition to continue the engagement, and his animals being

without forage (the country furnishing but inferior grazing),

and hearing nothing from General Hunter, he withdrew his command

to the north side of the North Anna, and commenced his return

march, reaching White House at the time before stated.  After

breaking up the depot at that place, he moved to the James

River, which he reached safely after heavy fighting.  He

commenced crossing on the 25th, near Fort Powhatan, without

further molestation, and rejoined the Army of the Potomac.



On the 22d, General Wilson, with his own division of cavalry of

the Army of the Potomac, and General Kautz's division of cavalry

of the Army of the James moved against the enemy's railroads

south of Richmond.  Striking the Weldon Railroad at Reams's

Station, destroying the depot and several miles of the road, and

the South Side road about fifteen miles from Petersburg, to near

Nottoway Station, where he met and defeated a force of the

enemy's cavalry.  He reached Burkesville Station on the

afternoon of the 23d, and from there destroyed the Danville

Railroad to Roanoke Bridge, a distance of twenty-five miles,

where he found the enemy in force, and in a position from which

he could not dislodge him.  He then commenced his return march,

and on the 28th met the enemy's cavalry in force at the Weldon

Railroad crossing of Stony Creek, where he had a severe but not

decisive engagement.  Thence he made a detour from his left with

a view of reaching Reams's Station (supposing it to be in our

possession).  At this place he was met by the enemy's cavalry,

supported by infantry, and forced to retire, with the loss of

his artillery and trains.  In this last encounter, General

Kautz, with a part of his command, became separated, and made

his way into our lines.  General Wilson, with the remainder of

his force, succeeded in crossing the Nottoway River and coming

in safely on our left and rear.  The damage to the enemy in this

expedition more than compensated for the losses we sustained.  It

severed all connection by railroad with Richmond for several

weeks.



With a view of cutting the enemy's railroad from near Richmond

to the Anna rivers, and making him wary of the situation of his

army in the Shenandoah, and, in the event of failure in this, to

take advantage of his necessary withdrawal of troops from

Petersburg, to explode a mine that had been prepared in front of

the 9th corps and assault the enemy's lines at that place, on the

night of the 26th of July the 2d corps and two divisions of the

cavalry corps and Kautz's cavalry were crossed to the north bank

of the James River and joined the force General Butler had

there.  On the 27th the enemy was driven from his intrenched

position, with the loss of four pieces of artillery.  On the

28th our lines were extended from Deep Bottom to New Market

Road, but in getting this position were attacked by the enemy in

heavy force.  The fighting lasted for several hours, resulting in

considerable loss to both sides.  The first object of this move

having failed, by reason of the very large force thrown there by

the enemy, I determined to take advantage of the diversion made,

by assaulting Petersburg before he could get his force back

there.  One division of the 2d corps was withdrawn on the night

of the 28th, and moved during the night to the rear of the 18th

corps, to relieve that corps in the line, that it might be

foot-loose in the assault to be made.  The other two divisions

of the 2d corps and Sheridan's cavalry were crossed over on the

night of the 29th and moved in front of Petersburg.  On the

morning of the 30th, between four and five o'clock, the mine was

sprung, blowing up a battery and most of a regiment, and the

advance of the assaulting column, formed of the 9th corps,

immediately took possession of the crater made by the explosion,

and the line for some distance to the right and left of it, and a

detached line in front of it, but for some cause failed to

advance promptly to the ridge beyond.  Had they done this, I

have every reason to believe that Petersburg would have

fallen.  Other troops were immediately pushed forward, but the

time consumed in getting them up enabled the enemy to rally from

his surprise (which had been complete), and get forces to this

point for its defence.  The captured line thus held being

untenable, and of no advantage to us, the troops were withdrawn,

but not without heavy loss.  Thus terminated in disaster what

promised to be the most successful assault of the campaign.



Immediately upon the enemy's ascertaining that General Hunter

was retreating from Lynchburg by way of the Kanawha River, thus

laying the Shenandoah Valley open for raid into Maryland and

Pennsylvania, he returned northward and moved down that

valley.  As soon as this movement of the enemy was ascertained,

General Hunter, who had reached the Kanawha River, was directed

to move his troops without delay, by river and railroad, to

Harper's Ferry; but owing to the difficulty of navigation by

reason of low water and breaks in the railroad, great delay was

experienced in getting there.  It became necessary, therefore,

to find other troops to check this movement of the enemy.  For

this purpose the 6th corps was taken from the armies operating

against Richmond, to which was added the 19th corps, then

fortunately beginning to arrive in Hampton Roads from the Gulf

Department, under orders issued immediately after the

ascertainment of the result of the Red River expedition.  The

garrisons of Baltimore and Washington were at this time made up

of heavy-artillery regiments, hundred days' men, and detachments

from the invalid corps.  One division under command of General

Ricketts, of the 6th corps, was sent to Baltimore, and the

remaining two divisions of the 6th corps, under General Wright,

were subsequently sent to Washington.  On the 3d of July the

enemy approached Martinsburg.  General Sigel, who was in command

of our forces there, retreated across the Potomac at

Shepherdtown; and General Weber, commanding at Harper's Ferry,

crossed the occupied Hagerstown, moving a strong column towards

Frederick City.  General Wallace, with Rickett's division and

his own command, the latter mostly new and undisciplined troops,

pushed out from Baltimore with great promptness, and met the

enemy in force on the Monocacy, near the crossing of the

railroad bridge.  His force was not sufficient to insure

success, but he fought the enemy nevertheless, and although it

resulted in a defeat to our arms, yet it detained the enemy, and

thereby served to enable General Wright to reach Washington with

two division of the 6th corps, and the advance of the 19th

corps, before him.  From Monocacy the enemy moved on Washington,

his cavalry advance reaching Rockville on the evening of the

10th.  On the 12th a reconnoissance was thrown out in front of

Fort Stevens, to ascertain the enemy's position and force.  A

severe skirmish ensued, in which we lost about two hundred and

eighty in killed and wounded.  The enemy's loss was probably

greater.  He commenced retreating during the night.  Learning

the exact condition of affairs at Washington, I requested by

telegraph, at forty-five minutes past eleven P.M., on the 12th,

the assignment of Major-General H. G. Wright to the command of

all the troops that could be made available to operate in the

field against the enemy, and directed that he should get outside

of the trenches with all the force he could, and push Early to

the last moment.  General Wright commenced the pursuit on the

13th; on the 18th the enemy was overtaken at Snicker's Ferry, on

the Shenandoah, when a sharp skirmish occurred; and on the 20th,

General Averell encountered and defeated a portion of the rebel

army at Winchester, capturing four pieces of artillery and

several hundred prisoners.



Learning that Early was retreating south towards Lynchburg or

Richmond, I directed that the 6th and 19th corps be got back to

the armies operating against Richmond, so that they might be

used in a movement against Lee before the return of the troops

sent by him into the valley; and that Hunter should remain in

the Shenandoah Valley, keeping between any force of the enemy

and Washington, acting on the defensive as much as possible.  I

felt that if the enemy had any notion of returning, the fact

would be developed before the 6th and 19th corps could leave

Washington.  Subsequently, the 19th corps was excepted form the

order to return to the James.



About the 25th it became evident that the enemy was again

advancing upon Maryland and Pennsylvania, and the 6th corps,

then at Washington, was ordered back to the vicinity of Harper's

Ferry.  The rebel force moved down the valley, and sent a raiding

party into Pennsylvania which on the 30th burned Chambersburg,

and then retreated, pursued by our cavalry, towards

Cumberland.  They were met and defeated by General Kelley, and

with diminished numbers escaped into the mountains of West

Virginia.  From the time of the first raid the telegraph wires

were frequently down between Washington and City Point, making

it necessary to transmit messages a part of the way by boat.  It

took from twenty-four to thirty-six hours to get dispatches

through and return answers would be received showing a

difference state of facts from those on which they were based,

causing confusion and apparent contradiction of orders that must

have considerably embarrassed those who had to execute them, and

rendered operations against the enemy less effective than they

otherwise would have been. To remedy this evil, it was evident

to my mind that some person should have the supreme command of

all the forces in the Department of West Virginia, Washington,

Susquehanna, and the Middle Department, and I so recommended.



On the 2d of August, I ordered General Sheridan to report in

person to Major-General Halleck, chief of staff, at Washington,

with a view to his assignment to the command of all the forces

against Early.  At this time the enemy was concentrated in the

neighborhood of Winchester, while our forces, under General

Hunter, were concentrated on the Monocacy, at the crossing of

the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, leaving open to the enemy

Western Maryland and Southern Pennsylvania.  From where I was, I

hesitated to give positive orders for the movement of our forces

at Monocacy, lest by so doing I should expose Washington.

Therefore, on the 4th, I left City Point to visit Hunter's

command, and determine for myself what was best to be done.  On

arrival there, and after consultation with General Hunter, I

issued to him the following instructions:





"MONOCACY BRIDGE, MARYLAND,

August 5, 1864--8 P.M.



"GENERAL:--Concentrate all your available force without delay in

the vicinity of Harper's Ferry, leaving only such railroad guards

and garrisons for public property as may be necessary.  Use, in

this concentrating, the railroad, if by so doing time can be

saved.  From Harper's Ferry, if it is found that the enemy has

moved north of the Potomac in large force, push north, following

him and attacking him wherever found; follow him, if driven south

of the Potomac, as long as it is safe to do so.  If it is

ascertained that the enemy has but a small force north of the

Potomac, then push south with the main force, detaching under a

competent commander, a sufficient force to look after the

raiders, and drive them to their homes.  In detaching such a

force,the brigade of the cavalry now en route from Washington

via Rockville may be taken into account.



"There are now on their way to join you three other brigades of

the best cavalry, numbering at least five thousand men and

horses.  These will be instructed, in the absence of further

orders, to join you by the south side of the Potomac.  One

brigade will probably start to-morrow.  In pushing up the

Shenandoah Valley, where it is expected you will have to go

first or last, it is desirable that nothing should be left to

invite the enemy to return.  Take all provisions, forage, and

stock wanted for the use of your command; such as cannot be

consumed, destroy.  It is not desirable that the buildings

should be destroyed--they should rather be protected; but the

people should be informed that, so long as an army can subsist

among them, recurrence of theses raids must be expected, and we

are determined to stop them at all hazards.



"Bear in mind, the object is to drive the enemy south; and to do

this you want to keep him always in sight.  Be guided in your

course by the course he takes.



"Make your own arrangements for supplies of all kinds, giving

regular vouchers for such as may be taken from loyal citizens in

the country through which you march.



"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.

"MAJOR-GENERAL D. HUNTER."





The troops were immediately put in motion, and the advance

reached Halltown that night.



General Hunter having, in our conversation, expressed a

willingness to be relieved from command, I telegraphed to have

General Sheridan, then at Washington, sent to Harper's Ferry by

the morning train, with orders to take general command of all

the troops in the field, and to call on General Hunter at

Monocacy, who would turn over to him my letter of

instructions.  I remained at Monocacy until General Sheridan

arrived, on the morning of the 6th, and, after a conference with

him in relation to military affairs in that vicinity, I returned

to City Point by way of Washington.



On the 7th of August, the Middle Department, and the Departments

of West Virginia, Washington, and Susquehanna, were constituted

into the "Middle Military Division," and  Major-General Sheridan

was assigned to temporary command of the same.



Two divisions of cavalry, commanded by Generals Torbert and

Wilson, were sent to Sheridan from the Army of the Potomac. The

first reached him at Harper's Ferry about the 11th of August.



His operations during the month of August and the fore part of

September were both of an offensive and defensive character,

resulting in many severe skirmishes, principally by the cavalry,

in which we were generally successful, but no general engagement

took place.  The two armies lay in such a position--the enemy on

the west bank of the Opequon Creek covering Winchester, and our

forces in front of Berryville--that either could bring on a

battle at any time.  Defeat to us would lay open to the enemy

the States of Maryland and Pennsylvania for long distances

before another army could be interposed to check him.  Under

these circumstances I hesitated about allowing the initiative to

be taken.  Finally, the use of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad,

and the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, which were both obstructed by

the enemy, became so indispensably necessary to us, and the

importance of relieving Pennsylvania and Maryland from

continuously threatened invasion so great, that I determined the

risk should be taken.  But fearing to telegraph the order for an

attack without knowing more than I did of General Sheridan's

feelings as to what would be the probable result, I left City

Point on the 15th of September to visit him at his headquarters,

to decide, after conference with him, what should be done.  I met

him at Charlestown, and he pointed out so distinctly how each

army lay; what he could do the moment he was authorized, and

expressed such confidence of success, that I saw there were but

two words of instructions necessary--Go in!  For the

conveniences of forage, the teams for supplying the army were

kept at Harper's Ferry.  I asked him if he could get out his

teams and supplies in time to make an attack on the ensuing

Tuesday morning.  His reply was, that he could before daylight

on Monday.  He was off promptly to time, and I may here add,

that the result was such that I have never since deemed it

necessary to visit General Sheridan before giving him orders.



Early on the morning of the 19th, General Sheridan attacked

General Early at the crossing on the Opequon Creek, and after a

most sanguinary and bloody battle, lasting until five o'clock in

the evening, defeated him with heavy loss, carrying his entire

position from Opequon Creek to Winchester, capturing several

thousand prisoners and five pieces of artillery.  The enemy

rallied, and made a stand in a strong position at Fisher's Hill,

where he was attacked, and again defeated with heavy loss on the

20th [22d].  Sheridan pursued him with great energy through

Harrisonburg, Staunton, and the gaps of the Blue Ridge.  After

stripping the upper valley of most of the supplies and

provisions for the rebel army, he returned to Strasburg, and

took position on the north side of Cedar Creek.



Having received considerable reinforcements, General Early again

returned to the valley, and, on the 9th of October, his cavalry

encountered ours near Strasburg, where the rebels were defeated,

with the loss of eleven pieces of artillery and three hundred and

fifty prisoners.  On the night of the 18th, the enemy crossed the

mountains which separate the branches of the Shenandoah, forded

the North Fork, and early on the morning of the 19th, under

cover of the darkness and the fog, surprised and turned our left

flank, and captured the batteries which enfiladed our whole

line.  Our troops fell back with heavy loss and in much

confusion, but were finally rallied between Middletown and

Newtown.  At this juncture, General Sheridan, who was at

Winchester when the battle commenced arrived on the field,

arranged his lines just in time to repulse a heavy attack of the

enemy, and immediately assuming the offensive, he attacked in

turn with great vigor.  The enemy was defeated with great

slaughter, and the loss of most of his artillery and trains, and

the trophies he had captured in the morning.  The wreck of his

army escaped during the night, and fled in the direction of

Staunton and Lynchburg.  Pursuit was made to Mount Jackson. Thus

ended this, the enemy's last attempt to invade the North via the

Shenandoah Valley.  I was now enabled to return the 6th corps to

the Army of the Potomac, and to send one division from Sheridan's

army to the Army of the James, and another to Savannah, Georgia,

to hold Sherman's new acquisitions on the sea-coast, and thus

enable him to move without detaching from his force for that

purpose.



Reports from various sources led me to believe that the enemy

had detached three divisions from Petersburg to reinforce Early

in the Shenandoah Valley.  I therefore sent the 2d corps and

Gregg's division of cavalry, of the Army of the Potomac, and a

force of General Butler's army, on the night of the 13th of

August, to threaten Richmond from the north side of the James,

to prevent him from sending troops away, and, if possible, to

draw back those sent.  In this move we captured six pieces of

artillery and several hundred prisoners, detained troops that

were under marching orders, and ascertained that but one

division (Kershaw's), of the three reputed detached, had gone.



The enemy having withdrawn heavily from Petersburg to resist

this movement, the 5th corps, General Warren commanding, was

moved out on the 18th, and took possession of the Weldon

Railroad.  During the day he had considerable fighting.  To

regain possession of the road, the enemy made repeated and

desperate assaults, but was each time repulsed with great

loss.  On the night of the 20th, the troops on the north side of

the James were withdrawn, and Hancock and Gregg returned to the

front at Petersburg.  On the 25th, the 2d corps and Gregg's

division of cavalry, while at Reams's Station destroying the

railroad, were attacked, and after desperate fighting, a part of

our line gave way, and five pieces of artillery fell into the

hands of the enemy.



By the 12th of September, a branch railroad was completed from

the City Point and Petersburg Railroad to the Weldon Railroad,

enabling us to supply, without difficulty, in all weather, the

army in front of Petersburg.



The extension of our lines across the Weldon Railroad compelled

the enemy to so extend his, that it seemed he could have but few

troops north of the James for the defence of Richmond.  On the

night of the 28th, the 10th corps, Major-General Birney, and the

18th corps, Major-General Ord commanding, of General Butler's

army, were crossed to the north side of the James, and advanced

on the morning of the 29th, carrying the very strong

fortifications and intrenchments below Chaffin's Farm, known as

Fort Harrison, capturing fifteen pieces of artillery, and the

New Market Road and intrenchments.  This success was followed up

by a gallant assault upon Fort Gilmer, immediately in front of

the Chaffin Farm fortifications, in which we were repulsed with

heavy loss.  Kautz's cavalry was pushed forward on the road to

the right of this, supported by infantry, and reached the

enemy's inner line, but was unable to get further.  The position

captured from the enemy was so threatening to Richmond, that I

determined to hold it.  The enemy made several desperate

attempts to dislodge us, all of which were unsuccessful, and for

which he paid dearly.  On the morning of the 30th, General Meade

sent out a reconnoissance with a view to attacking the enemy's

line, if it was found sufficiently weakened by withdrawal of

troops to the north side.  In this reconnoissance we captured

and held the enemy's works near Poplar Spring Church.  In the

afternoon, troops moving to get to the left of the point gained

were attacked by the enemy in heavy force, and compelled to fall

back until supported by the forces holding the captured works.

Our cavalry under Gregg was also attacked, but repulsed the

enemy with great loss.



On the 7th of October, the enemy attacked Kautz's cavalry north

of the James, and drove it back with heavy loss in killed,

wounded, and prisoners, and the loss of all the artillery eight

or nine pieces.  This he followed up by an attack on our

intrenched infantry line, but was repulsed with severe

slaughter.  On the 13th, a reconnoissance was sent out by

General Butler, with a view to drive the enemy from some new

works he was constructing, which resulted in very heavy loss to

us.



On the 27th, the Army of the Potomac, leaving only sufficient

men to hold its fortified line, moved by the enemy's right

flank.  The 2d corps, followed by two divisions of the 5th

corps, with the cavalry in advance and covering our left flank,

forced a passage of Hatcher's Run, and moved up the south side

of it towards the South Side Railroad, until the 2d corps and

part of the cavalry reached the Boydton Plank Road where it

crosses Hatcher's Run.  At this point we were six miles distant

from the South Side Railroad, which I had hoped by this movement

to reach and hold.  But finding that we had not reached the end

of the enemy's fortifications, and no place presenting itself

for a successful assault by which he might be doubled up and

shortened, I determined to withdraw to within our fortified

line.  Orders were given accordingly.  Immediately upon

receiving a report that General Warren had connected with

General Hancock, I returned to my headquarters.  Soon after I

left the enemy moved out across Hatcher's Run, in the gap

between Generals Hancock and Warren, which was not closed as

reported, and made a desperate attack on General Hancock's right

and rear.  General Hancock immediately faced his corps to meet

it, and after a bloody combat drove the enemy within his works,

and withdrew that night to his old position.



In support of this movement, General Butler made a demonstration

on the north side of the James, and attacked the enemy on the

Williamsburg Road, and also on the York River Railroad.  In the

former he was unsuccessful; in the latter he succeeded in

carrying a work which was afterwards abandoned, and his forces

withdrawn to their former positions.



From this time forward the operations in front of Petersburg and

Richmond, until the spring campaign of 1865, were confined to the

defence and extension of our lines, and to offensive movements

for crippling the enemy's lines of communication, and to prevent

his detaching any considerable force to send south.  By the 7th

of February, our lines were extended to Hatcher's Run, and the

Weldon Railroad had been destroyed to Hicksford.



General Sherman moved from Chattanooga on the 6th of May, with

the Armies of the Cumberland, Tennessee, and Ohio, commanded,

respectively, by Generals Thomas McPherson, and Schofield, upon

Johnston's army at Dalton; but finding the enemy's position at

Buzzard's Roost, covering Dalton, too strong to be assaulted,

General McPherson was sent through Snake Gap to turn it, while

Generals Thomas and Schofield threatened it in front and on the

north.  This movement was successful.  Johnston, finding his

retreat likely to be cut off, fell back to his fortified

position at Resaca, where he was attacked on the afternoon of

May 15th.  A heavy battle ensued.  During the night the enemy

retreated south.  Late on the 17th, his rear-guard was overtaken

near Adairsville, and heavy skirmishing followed.  The next

morning, however, he had again disappeared.  He was vigorously

pursued, and was overtaken at Cassville on the 19th, but during

the ensuing night retreated across the Etowah.  While these

operations were going on, General Jefferson C. Davis's division

of Thomas's army was sent to Rome, capturing it with its forts

and artillery, and its valuable mills and foundries.  General

Sherman, having give his army a few days' rest at this point,

again put it in motion on the 23d, for Dallas, with a view of

turning the difficult pass at Allatoona.  On the afternoon of

the 25th, the advance, under General Hooker, had a severe battle

with the enemy, driving him back to New Hope Church, near

Dallas.  Several sharp encounters occurred at this point.  The

most important was on the 28th, when the enemy assaulted General

McPherson at Dallas, but received a terrible and bloody repulse.



On the 4th of June, Johnston abandoned his intrenched position

at New Hope Church, and retreated to the strong positions of

Kenesaw, Pine, and Lost mountains.  He was forced to yield the

two last-named places, and concentrate his army on Kenesaw,

where, on the 27th, Generals Thomas and McPherson made a

determined but unsuccessful assault.  On the night of the 2d of

July, Sherman commenced moving his army by the right flank, and

on the morning of the 3d, found that the enemy, in consequence

of this movement, had abandoned Kenesaw and retreated across the

Chattahoochee.



General Sherman remained on the Chattahoochee to give his men

rest and get up stores until the 17th of July, when he resumed

his operations, crossed the Chattahoochee, destroyed a large

portion of the railroad to Augusta, and drove the enemy back to

Atlanta. At this place General Hood succeeded General Johnston

in command of the rebel army, and assuming the

offensive-defensive policy, made several severe attacks upon

Sherman in the vicinity of Atlanta, the most desperate and

determined of which was on the 22d of July.  About one P.M. of

this day the brave, accomplished, and noble-hearted McPherson

was killed.  General Logan succeeded him, and commanded the Army

of the Tennessee through this desperate battle, and until he was

superseded by Major-General Howard, on the 26th, with the same

success and ability that had characterized him in the command of

a corps or division.



In all these attacks the enemy was repulsed with great loss.

Finding it impossible to entirely invest the place, General

Sherman, after securing his line of communications across the

Chattahoochee, moved his main force round by the enemy's left

flank upon the Montgomery and Macon roads, to draw the enemy

from his fortifications.  In this he succeeded, and after

defeating the enemy near Rough-and-Ready, Jonesboro, and

Lovejoy's, forcing him to retreat to the south, on the 2d of

September occupied Atlanta, the objective point of his campaign.



About the time of this move, the rebel cavalry, under Wheeler,

attempted to cut his communications in the rear, but was

repulsed at Dalton, and driven into East Tennessee, whence it

proceeded west to McMinnville, Murfreesboro', and Franklin, and

was finally driven south of the Tennessee.  The damage done by

this raid was repaired in a few days.



During the partial investment of Atlanta, General Rousseau

joined General Sherman with a force of cavalry from Decatur,

having made a successful raid upon the Atlanta and Montgomery

Railroad, and its branches near Opelika. Cavalry raids were also

made by Generals McCook, Garrard, and Stoneman, to cut the

remaining Railroad communication with Atlanta.  The first two

were successful the latter, disastrous.



General Sherman's movement from Chattanooga to Atlanta was

prompt, skilful, and brilliant.  The history of his flank

movements and battles during that memorable campaign will ever

be read with an interest unsurpassed by anything in history.



His own report, and those of his subordinate commanders,

accompanying it, give the details of that most successful

campaign.



He was dependent for the supply of his armies upon a

single-track railroad from Nashville to the point where he was

operating.  This passed the entire distance through a hostile

country, and every foot of it had to be protected by troops. The

cavalry force of the enemy under Forrest, in Northern

Mississippi, was evidently waiting for Sherman to advance far

enough into the mountains of Georgia, to make a retreat

disastrous, to get upon this line and destroy it beyond the

possibility of further use.  To guard against this danger,

Sherman left what he supposed to be a sufficient force to

operate against Forrest in West Tennessee.  He directed General

Washburn, who commanded there, to send Brigadier-General S. D.

Sturgis in command of this force to attack him.  On the morning

of the 10th of June, General Sturgis met the enemy near Guntown,

Mississippi, was badly beaten, and driven back in utter rout and

confusion to Memphis, a distance of about one hundred miles,

hotly pursued by the enemy.  By this, however, the enemy was

defeated in his designs upon Sherman's line of communications.

The persistency with which he followed up this success exhausted

him, and made a season for rest and repairs necessary.  In the

meantime, Major-General A. J. Smith, with the troops of the Army

of the Tennessee that had been sent by General Sherman to General

Banks, arrived at Memphis on their return from Red River, where

they had done most excellent service.  He was directed by

General Sherman to immediately take the offensive against

Forrest.  This he did with the promptness and effect which has

characterized his whole military career.  On the 14th of July,

he met the enemy at Tupelo, Mississippi, and whipped him

badly.  The fighting continued through three days.  Our loss was

small compared with that of the enemy.  Having accomplished the

object of his expedition, General Smith returned to Memphis.



During the months of March and April this same force under

Forrest annoyed us considerably.  On the 24th of March it

captured Union City, Kentucky, and its garrison, and on the 24th

attacked Paducah, commanded by Colonel S. G. Hicks, 40th Illinois

Volunteers.  Colonel H., having but a small force, withdrew to

the forts near the river, from where he repulsed the enemy and

drove him from the place.



On the 13th of April, part of this force, under the rebel

General Buford, summoned the garrison of Columbus, Kentucky, to

surrender, but received for reply from Colonel Lawrence, 34th

New Jersey Volunteers, that being placed there by his Government

with adequate force to hold his post and repel all enemies from

it, surrender was out of the question.



On the morning of the same day Forrest attacked Fort Pillow,

Tennessee, garrisoned by a detachment of Tennessee cavalry and

the 1st Regiment Alabama colored troops, commanded by Major

Booth.  The garrison fought bravely until about three o'clock in

the afternoon, when the enemy carried the works by assault; and,

after our men threw down their arms, proceeded to an inhuman and

merciless massacre of the garrison.



On the 14th, General Buford, having failed at Columbus, appeared

before Paducah, but was again driven off.



Guerillas and raiders, seemingly emboldened by Forrest's

operations, were also very active in Kentucky.  The most noted

of these was Morgan.  With a force of from two to three thousand

cavalry, he entered the State through Pound Gap in the latter

part of May.  On the 11th of June they attacked and captured

Cynthiana, with its entire garrison.  On the 12th he was

overtaken by General Burbridge, and completely routed with heavy

loss, and was finally driven out of the State.  This notorious

guerilla was afterwards surprised and killed near Greenville,

Tennessee, and his command captured and dispersed by General

Gillem.



In the absence of official reports of the commencement of the

Red River expedition, except so far as relates to the movements

of the troops sent by General Sherman under General A. J. Smith,

I am unable to give the date of its starting.  The troops under

General Smith, comprising two divisions of the 16th and a


detachment of the 17th army corps, left Vicksburg on the 10th of

March, and reached the designated point on Red River one day

earlier than that appointed by General Banks.  The rebel forces

at Fort de Russy, thinking to defeat him, left the fort on the

14th to give him battle in the open field; but, while occupying

the enemy with skirmishing and demonstrations, Smith pushed

forward to Fort de Russy, which had been left with a weak

garrison, and captured it with its garrison about three hundred

and fifty men, eleven pieces of artillery, and many

small-arms.  Our loss was but slight.  On the 15th he pushed

forward to Alexandria, which place he reached on the 18th.  On

the 21st he had an engagement with the enemy at Henderson's

Hill, in which he defeated him, capturing two hundred and ten

prisoners and four pieces of artillery.



On the 28th, he again attacked and defeated the enemy under the

rebel General Taylor, at Cane River.  By the 26th, General Banks

had assembled his whole army at Alexandria, and pushed forward to

Grand Ecore.  On the morning of April 6th he moved from Grand

Ecore.  On the afternoon of the 7th, he advanced and met the

enemy near Pleasant Hill, and drove him from the field.  On the

same afternoon the enemy made a stand eight miles beyond

Pleasant Hill, but was again compelled to retreat.  On the 8th,

at Sabine Cross Roads and Peach Hill, the enemy attacked and

defeated his advance, capturing nineteen pieces of artillery and

an immense amount of transportation and stores.  During the

night, General Banks fell back to Pleasant Hill, where another

battle was fought on the 9th, and the enemy repulsed with great

loss.  During the night, General Banks continued his retrograde

movement to Grand Ecore, and thence to Alexandria, which he

reached on the 27th of April.  Here a serious difficulty arose

in getting Admiral Porter's fleet which accompanied the

expedition, over the rapids, the water having fallen so much

since they passed up as to prevent their return.  At the

suggestion of Colonel (now Brigadier-General) Bailey, and under

his superintendence, wing-dams were constructed, by which the

channel was contracted so that the fleet passed down the rapids

in safety.



The army evacuated Alexandria on the 14th of May, after

considerable skirmishing with the enemy's advance, and reached

Morganzia and Point Coupee near the end of the month.  The

disastrous termination of this expedition, and the lateness of

the season, rendered impracticable the carrying out of my plans

of a movement in force sufficient to insure the capture of

Mobile.



On the 23d of March, Major-General Steele left Little Rock with

the 7th army corps, to  cooperate with General Banks's

expedition on the Red River, and reached Arkadelphia on the

28th.  On the 16th of April, after driving the enemy before him,

he was joined, near Elkin's Ferry, in Washita County, by General

Thayer, who had marched from Fort Smith.  After several severe

skirmishes, in which the enemy was defeated, General Steele

reached Camden, which he occupied about the middle of April.



On learning the defeat and consequent retreat of General Banks

on Red River, and the loss of one of his own trains at Mark's

Mill, in Dallas County, General Steele determined to fall back

to the Arkansas River.  He left Camden on the 26th of April, and

reached Little Rock on the 2d of May.  On the 30th of April, the

enemy attacked him while crossing Saline River at Jenkins's

Ferry, but was repulsed with considerable loss.  Our loss was

about six hundred in killed, wounded and prisoners.



Major-General Canby, who had been assigned to the command of the

"Military Division of the West Mississippi," was therefore

directed to send the 19th army corps to join the armies

operating against Richmond, and to limit the remainder of his

command to such operations as might be necessary to hold the

positions and lines of communications he then occupied.



Before starting General A. J. Smith's troops back to Sherman,

General Canby sent a part of it to disperse a force of the enemy

that was collecting near the Mississippi River.  General Smith

met and defeated this force near Lake Chicot on the 5th of

June.  Our loss was about forty killed and seventy wounded.



In the latter part of July, General Canby sent Major-General

Gordon Granger, with such forces as he could collect, to

co-operate with Admiral Farragut against the defences of Mobile

Bay.  On the 8th of August, Fort Gaines surrendered to the

combined naval and land forces.  Fort Powell was blown up and

abandoned.



On the 9th, Fort Morgan was invested, and, after a severe

bombardment, surrendered on the 23d.  The total captures

amounted to one thousand four hundred and sixty-four prisoners,

and one hundred and four pieces of artillery.



About the last of August, it being reported that the rebel

General Price, with a force of about ten thousand men, had

reached Jacksonport, on his way to invade Missouri, General A.

J. Smith's command, then en route from Memphis to join Sherman,

was ordered to Missouri.  A cavalry force was also, at the same

time, sent from Memphis, under command of Colonel Winslow.  This

made General Rosecrans's forces superior to those of Price, and

no doubt was entertained he would be able to check Price and

drive him back; while the forces under General Steele, in

Arkansas, would cut off his retreat.  On the 26th day of

September, Price attacked Pilot Knob and forced the garrison to

retreat, and thence moved north to the Missouri River, and

continued up that river towards Kansas.  General Curtis,

commanding Department of Kansas, immediately collected such

forces as he could to repel the invasion of Kansas, while

General Rosecrans's cavalry was operating in his rear.



The enemy was brought to battle on the Big Blue and defeated,

with the loss of nearly all his artillery and trains and a large

number of prisoners.  He made a precipitate retreat to Northern

Arkansas.  The impunity with which Price was enabled to roam

over the State of Missouri for a long time, and the incalculable

mischief done by him, show to how little purpose a superior force

may be used.  There is no reason why General Rosecrans should not

have concentrated his forces, and beaten and driven Price before

the latter reached Pilot Knob.



September 20th, the enemy's cavalry, under Forrest, crossed the

Tennessee near Waterloo, Alabama, and on the 23d attacked the

garrison at Athens, consisting of six hundred men, which

capitulated on the 24th.  Soon after the surrender two regiments

of reinforcements arrived, and after a severe fight were

compelled to surrender.  Forrest destroyed the railroad

westward, captured the garrison at Sulphur Branch trestle,

skirmished with the garrison at Pulaski on the 27th, and on the

same day cut the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad near

Tullahoma and Dechard.  On the morning of the 30th, one column

of Forrest's command, under Buford, appeared before Huntsville,

and summoned the surrender of the garrison.  Receiving an answer

in the negative, he remained in the vicinity of the place until

next morning, when he again summoned its surrender, and received

the same reply as on the night before.  He withdrew in the

direction of Athens which place had been regarrisoned, and

attacked it on the afternoon of the 1st of October, but without

success.  On the morning of the 2d he renewed his attack, but

was handsomely repulsed.



Another column under Forrest appeared before Columbia on the

morning of the 1st, but did not make an attack.  On the morning

of the 3d he moved towards Mount Pleasant.  While these

operations were going on, every exertion was made by General

Thomas to destroy the forces under Forrest before he could

recross the Tennessee, but was unable to prevent his escape to

Corinth, Mississippi.



In September, an expedition under General Burbridge was sent to

destroy the saltworks at Saltville, Virginia. He met the enemy

on the 2d of October, about three miles and a half from

Saltville, and drove him into his strongly intrenched position

around the salt-works, from which he was unable to dislodge

him.  During the night he withdrew his command and returned to

Kentucky.



General Sherman, immediately after the fall of Atlanta, put his

armies in camp in and about the place, and made all preparations

for refitting and supplying them for future service.  The great

length of road from Atlanta to the Cumberland River, however,

which had to be guarded, allowed the troops but little rest.



During this time Jefferson Davis made a speech in Macon,

Georgia, which was reported in the papers of the South, and soon

became known to the whole country, disclosing the plans of the

enemy, thus enabling General Sherman to fully meet them.  He

exhibited the weakness of supposing that an army that had been

beaten and fearfully decimated in a vain attempt at the

defensive, could successfully undertake the offensive against

the army that had so often defeated it.



In execution of this plan, Hood, with this army, was soon

reported to the south-west of Atlanta. Moving far to Sherman's

right, he succeeded in reaching the railroad about Big Shanty,

and moved north on it.



General Sherman, leaving a force to hold Atlanta, with the

remainder of his army fell upon him and drove him to Gadsden,

Alabama. Seeing the constant annoyance he would have with the

roads to his rear if he attempted to hold Atlanta, General

Sherman proposed the abandonment and destruction of that place,

with all the railroads leading to it, and telegraphed me as

follows:





"CENTREVILLE, GEORGIA

October 10--noon.



"Dispatch about Wilson just received.  Hood is now crossing

Coosa River, twelve miles below Rome, bound west.  If he passes

over the Mobile and Ohio road, had I not better execute the plan

of my letter sent by Colonel Porter, and leave General Thomas

with the troops now in Tennessee to defend the State?  He will

have an ample force when the reinforcements ordered reach

Nashville.



"W. T. SHERMAN, Major-General.

"LIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT."





For a full understanding of the plan referred to in this

dispatch, I quote from the letter sent by Colonel Porter:  "I

will therefore give my opinion, that your army and Canby's

should be reinforced to the maximum; that after you get

Wilmington, you strike for Savannah and the river; that Canby be

instructed to hold the Mississippi River, and send a force to get

Columbus, Georgia, either by the way of the Alabama or the

Appalachicola, and that I keep Hood employed and put my army in

final order for a march on Augusta, Columbia, and Charleston, to

be ready as soon as Wilmington is sealed as to commerce and the

city of Savannah is in our possession."  This was in reply to a

letter of mine of date September 12th, in answer to a dispatch

of his containing substantially the same proposition, and in

which I informed him of a proposed movement against Wilmington,

and of the situation in Virginia, etc.





"CITY POINT, VIRGINIA,



October 11, 1864--11 A.M.



"Your dispatch of October 10th received.  Does it not look as if

Hood was going to attempt the invasion of Middle Tennessee, using

the Mobile and Ohio and Memphis and Charleston roads to supply

his base on the Tennessee River, about Florence or Decatur?  If

he does this, he ought to be met and prevented from getting

north of the Tennessee River.  If you were to cut loose, I do

not believe you would meet Hood's army, but would be bushwhacked

by all the old men and little boys, and such railroad guards as

are still left at home.  Hood would probably strike for

Nashville, thinking that by going north he could inflict greater

damage upon us than we could upon the rebels by going south.  If

there is any way of getting at Hood's army, I would prefer that,

but I must trust to your own judgment.  I find I shall not be

able to send a force from here to act with you on Savannah. Your

movements, therefore, will be independent of mine; at least until

the fall of Richmond takes place.  I am afraid Thomas, with such

lines of road as he has to protect, could not prevent Hood from

going north.  With Wilson turned loose, with all your cavalry,

you will find the rebels put much more on the defensive than

heretofore.



"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.

"MAJOR-GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN."





KINGSTON, GEORGIA,

October 11--11 A.M.



"Hood moved his army from Palmetto Station across by Dallas and

Cedartown, and is now on the Coosa River, south of Rome.  He

threw one corps on my road at Acworth, and I was forced to

follow.  I hold Atlanta with the 20th corps, and have strong

detachments along my line.  This reduces my active force to a

comparatively small army.  We cannot remain here on the

defensive.  With the twenty-five thousand men, and the bold

cavalry he has, he can constantly break my roads.  I would

infinitely prefer to make a wreck of the road, and of the

country from Chattanooga to Atlanta including the latter city

send back all my wounded and worthless, and with my effective

army, move through Georgia, smashing things, to the sea. Hood

may turn into Tennessee and Kentucky, but I believe he will be

forced to follow me.  Instead of my being on the defensive, I

would be on the offensive; instead of guessing at what he means

to do, he would have to guess at my plans.  The difference in

war is full twenty-five per cent.  I can make Savannah,

Charleston, or the mouth of the Chattahoochee.



"Answer quick, as I know we will not have the telegraph long.



"W. T. SHERMAN, Major-General.

"LIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT."





CITY POINT, VIRGINIA,

October 11,1864--11.30 P.M.



"Your dispatch of to-day received.  If you are satisfied the

trip to the sea-coast can be made, holding the line of the

Tennessee River firmly, you may make it, destroying all the

railroad south of Dalton or Chattanooga, as you think best.



"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.

"MAJOR-GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN."





It was the original design to hold Atlanta, and by getting

through to the coast, with a garrison left on the southern

railroads, leading east and west, through Georgia, to

effectually sever the east from the west.  In other words, cut

the would-be Confederacy in two again, as it had been cut once

by our gaining possession of the Mississippi River.  General

Sherman's plan virtually effected this object.



General Sherman commenced at once his preparations for his

proposed movement, keeping his army in position in the meantime

to watch Hood.  Becoming satisfied that Hood had moved westward

from Gadsden across Sand Mountain, General Sherman sent the 4th

corps,  Major-General Stanley commanding, and the 23d corps,

Major-General Schofield commanding, back to Chattanooga to

report to Major-General Thomas, at Nashville, whom he had placed

in command of all the troops of his military division, save the

four army corps and cavalry division he designed to move with

through Georgia. With the troops thus left at his disposal,

there was little doubt that General Thomas could hold the line

of the Tennessee, or, in the event Hood should force it, would

be able to concentrate and beat him in battle.  It was therefore

readily consented to that Sherman should start for the sea-coast.



Having concentrated his troops at Atlanta by the 14th of

November, he commenced his march, threatening both Augusta and

Macon.  His coming-out point could not be definitely fixed.

Having to gather his subsistence as he marched through the

country, it was not impossible that a force inferior to his own

might compel him to head for such point as he could reach,

instead of such as he might prefer.  The blindness of the enemy,

however, in ignoring his movement, and sending Hood's army, the

only considerable force he had west of Richmond and east of the

Mississippi River, northward on an offensive campaign, left the

whole country open, and Sherman's route to his own choice.



How that campaign was conducted, how little opposition was met

with, the condition of the country through which the armies

passed, the capture of Fort McAllister, on the Savannah River,

and the occupation of Savannah on the 21st of December, are all

clearly set forth in General Sherman's admirable report.



Soon after General Sherman commenced his march from Atlanta, two

expeditions, one from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and one from

Vicksburg, Mississippi, were started by General Canby to cut the

enemy's lines of communication with Mobile and detain troops in

that field.  General Foster, commanding Department of the South,

also sent an expedition, via Broad River, to destroy the railroad

between Charleston and Savannah.  The expedition from Vicksburg,

under command of Brevet Brigadier-General E. D. Osband (colonel

3d United States colored cavalry), captured, on the 27th of

November, and destroyed the Mississippi Central Railroad bridge

and trestle-work over Big Black River, near Canton, thirty miles

of the road, and two locomotives, besides large amounts of

stores.  The expedition from Baton Rouge was without favorable

results.  The expedition from the Department of the South, under

the immediate command of Brigadier-General John P. Hatch,

consisting of about five thousand men of all arms, including a

brigade from the navy, proceeded up Broad River and debarked at

Boyd's Neck on the 29th of November, from where it moved to

strike the railroad at Grahamsville.  At Honey Hill, about three

miles from Grahamsville, the enemy was found and attacked in a

strongly fortified position, which resulted, after severe

fighting, in our repulse with a loss of seven hundred and

forty-six in killed, wounded, and missing.  During the night

General Hatch withdrew.  On the 6th of December General Foster

obtained a position covering the Charleston and Savannah

Railroad, between the Coosawhatchie and Tulifinny rivers.



Hood, instead of following Sherman, continued his move

northward, which seemed to me to be leading to his certain

doom.  At all events, had I had the power to command both

armies, I should not have changed the orders under which he

seemed to be acting.  On the 26th of October, the advance of

Hood's army attacked the garrison at Decatur, Alabama, but

failing to carry the place, withdrew towards Courtland, and

succeeded, in the face of our cavalry, in effecting a lodgment

on the north side of the Tennessee River, near Florence.  On the

28th, Forrest reached the Tennessee, at Fort Heiman, and captured

a gunboat and three transports.  On the 2d of November he planted

batteries above and below Johnsonville, on the opposite side of

the river, isolating three gunboats and eight transports.  On

the 4th the enemy opened his batteries upon the place, and was

replied to from the gunboats and the garrison.  The gunboats

becoming disabled were set on fire, as also were the transports,

to prevent their falling into the hands of the enemy.  About a

million and a half dollars' worth of store and property on the

levee and in storehouses was consumed by fire.  On the 5th the

enemy disappeared and crossed to the north side of the Tennessee

River, above Johnsonville, moving towards Clifton, and

subsequently joined Hood.  On the night of the 5th, General

Schofield, with the advance of the 23d corps, reached

Johnsonville, but finding the enemy gone, was ordered to

Pulaski, and was put in command of all the troopers there, with

instruction to watch the movements of Hood and retard his

advance, but not to risk a general engagement until the arrival

of General A. J. Smith's command from Missouri, and until

General Wilson could get his cavalry remounted.



On the 19th, General Hood continued his advance.  General

Thomas, retarding him as much as possible, fell back towards

Nashville for the purpose of concentrating his command and

gaining time for the arrival of reinforcements.  The enemy

coming up with our main force, commanded by General Schofield,

at Franklin, on the 30th, assaulted our works repeatedly during

the afternoon until late at night, but were in every instance

repulsed.  His loss in this battle was one thousand seven

hundred and fifty killed, seven hundred and two prisoners, and

three thousand eight hundred wounded.  Among his losses were six

general officers killed, six wounded, and one captured.  Our

entire loss was two thousand three hundred.  This was the first

serious opposition the enemy met with, and I am satisfied was

the fatal blow to all his expectations.  During the night,

General Schofield fell back towards Nashville.  This left the

field to the enemy--not lost by battle, but voluntarily

abandoned--so that General Thomas's whole force might be brought

together.  The enemy followed up and commenced the establishment

of his line in front of Nashville on the 2d of December.



As soon as it was ascertained that Hood was crossing the

Tennessee River, and that Price was going out of Missouri,

General Rosecrans was ordered to send to General Thomas the

troops of General A. J. Smith's command, and such other troops

as he could spare.  The advance of this reinforcement reached

Nashville on the 30th of November.



On the morning of the 15th December, General Thomas attacked

Hood in position, and, in a battle lasting two days, defeated

and drove him from the field in the utmost confusion, leaving in

our hand most of his artillery and many thousand prisoners,

including four general officers.



Before the battle of Nashville I grew very impatient over, as it

appeared to me, the unnecessary delay.  This impatience was

increased upon learning that the enemy had sent a force of

cavalry across the Cumberland into Kentucky.  I feared Hood

would cross his whole army and give us great trouble there.

After urging upon General Thomas the necessity of immediately

assuming the offensive, I started West to superintend matters

there in person.  Reaching Washington City, I received General

Thomas's dispatch announcing his attack upon the enemy, and the

result as far as the battle had progressed.  I was delighted.

All fears and apprehensions were dispelled.  I am not yet

satisfied but that General Thomas, immediately upon the

appearance of Hood before Nashville, and before he had time to

fortify, should have moved out with his whole force and given

him battle, instead of waiting to remount his cavalry, which

delayed him until the inclemency of the weather made it

impracticable to attack earlier than he did.  But his final

defeat of Hood was so complete, that it will be accepted as a

vindication of that distinguished officer's judgment.



After Hood's defeat at Nashville he retreated, closely pursued

by cavalry and infantry, to the Tennessee River, being forced to

abandon many pieces of artillery and most of his

transportation.  On the 28th of December our advanced forces

ascertained that he had made good his escape to the south side

of the river.



About this time, the rains having set in heavily in Tennessee

and North Alabama, making it difficult to move army

transportation and artillery, General Thomas stopped the pursuit

by his main force at the Tennessee River.  A small force of

cavalry, under Colonel W. J. Palmer, 15th Pennsylvania

Volunteers, continued to follow Hood for some distance,

capturing considerable transportation and all the enemy's

pontoon-bridge.  The details of these operations will be found

clearly set forth in General Thomas's report.



A cavalry expedition, under Brevet Major-General Grierson,

started from Memphis on the 21st of December.  On the 25th he

surprised and captured Forrest's dismounted camp at Verona,

Mississippi, on the Mobile and Ohio Railroad, destroyed the

railroad, sixteen cars loaded with wagons and pontoons for

Hood's army, four thousand new English carbines, and large

amounts of public stores.  On the morning of the 28th he

attacked and captured a force of the enemy at Egypt, and

destroyed a train of fourteen cars; thence turning to the

south-west, he struck the Mississippi Central Railroad at

Winona, destroyed the factories and large amounts of stores at

Bankston, and the machine-shops and public property at Grenada,

arriving at Vicksburg January 5th.



During the operations in Middle Tennessee, the enemy, with a

force under General Breckinridge, entered East Tennessee.  On

the 13th of November he attacked General Gillem, near

Morristown, capturing his artillery and several hundred

prisoners.  Gillem, with what was left of his command, retreated

to Knoxville.  Following up his success, Breckinridge moved to

near Knoxville, but withdrew on the 18th, followed by General

Ammen.  Under the directions of General Thomas, General Stoneman

concentrated the commands of Generals Burbridge and Gillem near

Bean's Station to operate against Breckinridge, and destroy or

drive him into Virginia--destroy the salt-works at Saltville,

and the railroad into Virginia as far as he could go without

endangering his command.  On the 12th of December he commenced

his movement, capturing and dispersing the enemy's forces

wherever he met them.  On the 16th he struck the enemy, under

Vaughn, at Marion, completely routing and pursuing him to

Wytheville, capturing all his artillery, trains, and one hundred

and ninety-eight prisoners; and destroyed Wytheville, with its

stores and supplies, and the extensive lead-works near there.

Returning to Marion, he met a force under Breckinridge,

consisting, among other troops, of the garrison of Saltville,

that had started in pursuit.  He at once made arrangements to

attack it the next morning; but morning found Breckinridge

gone.  He then moved directly to Saltville, and destroyed the

extensive salt-works at that place, a large amount of stores,

and captured eight pieces of artillery.  Having thus

successfully executed his instructions, he returned General

Burbridge to Lexington and General Gillem to Knoxville.



Wilmington, North Carolina, was the most important sea-coast

port left to the enemy through which to get supplies from

abroad, and send cotton and other products out by

blockade-runners, besides being a place of great strategic

value.  The navy had been making strenuous exertions to seal the

harbor of Wilmington, but with only partial effect.  The nature

of the outlet of Cape Fear River was such, that it required

watching for so great a distance that, without possession of the

land north of New Inlet, or Fort Fisher, it was impossible for

the navy to entirely close the harbor against the entrance of

blockade-runners.



To secure the possession of this land required the co-operation

of a land force, which I agreed to furnish.  Immediately

commenced the assemblage in Hampton Roads, under Admiral D. D.

Porter, of the most formidable armada ever collected for

concentration upon one given point.  This necessarily attracted

the attention of the enemy, as well as that of the loyal North;

and through the imprudence of the public press, and very likely

of officers of both branches of service, the exact object of the

expedition became a subject of common discussion in the

newspapers both North and South.  The enemy, thus warned,

prepared to meet it.  This caused a postponement of the

expedition until the later part of November, when, being again

called upon by Hon. G. V. Fox, Assistant Secretary of the Navy,

I agreed to furnish the men required at once, and went myself,

in company with Major-General Butler, to Hampton Roads, where we

had a conference with Admiral Porter as to the force required and

the time of starting.  A force of six thousand five hundred men

was regarded as sufficient.  The time of starting was not

definitely arranged, but it was thought all would be ready by

the 6th of December, if not before.  Learning, on the 30th of

November, that Bragg had gone to Georgia, taking with him most

of the forces about Wilmington, I deemed it of the utmost

importance that the expedition should reach its destination

before the return of Bragg, and directed General Butler to make

all arrangements for the departure of Major-General Weitzel, who

had been designated to command the land forces, so that the navy

might not be detained one moment.



On the 6th of December, the following instructions were given:





"CITY POINT, VIRGINIA, December 6, 1864.



"GENERAL:  The first object of the expedition under General

Weitzel is to close to the enemy the port of Wilmington.  If

successful in this, the second will be to capture Wilmington

itself.  There are reasonable grounds to hope for success, if

advantage can be taken of the absence of the greater part of the

enemy's forces now looking after Sherman in Georgia.  The

directions you have given for the numbers and equipment of the

expedition are all right, except in the unimportant matter of

where they embark and the amount of intrenching tools to be

taken.  The object of the expedition will be gained by effecting

a landing on the main land between Cape Fear River and the

Atlantic, north of the north entrance to the river.  Should such

landing be effected while the enemy still holds Fort Fisher and

the batteries guarding the entrance to the river, then the

troops should intrench themselves, and, by co-operating with the

navy, effect the reduction and capture of those places.  These in

our hands, the navy could enter the harbor, and the port of

Wilmington would be sealed.  Should Fort Fisher and the point of

land on which it is built fall into the hands of our troops

immediately on landing, then it will be worth the attempt to

capture Wilmington by a forced march and surprise.  If time is

consumed in gaining the first object of the expedition, the

second will become a matter of after consideration.



"The details for execution are intrusted to you and the officer

immediately in command of the troops.



"Should the troops under General Weitzel fail to effect a

landing at or near Fort Fisher, they will be returned to the

armies operating against Richmond without delay.



"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.

"MAJOR-GENERAL B. F. BUTLER."





General Butler commanding the army from which the troops were

taken for this enterprise, and the territory within which they

were to operate, military courtesy required that all orders and

instructions should go through him.  They were so sent, but

General Weitzel has since officially informed me that he never

received the foregoing instructions, nor was he aware of their

existence, until he read General Butler's published official

report of the Fort Fisher failure, with my indorsement and

papers accompanying it.  I had no idea of General Butler's

accompanying the expedition until the evening before it got off

from Bermuda Hundred, and then did not dream but that General

Weitzel had received all the instructions, and would be in

command.  I rather formed the idea that General Butler was

actuated by a desire to witness the effect of the explosion of

the powder-boat.  The expedition was detained several days at

Hampton Roads, awaiting the loading of the powder-boat.



The importance of getting the Wilmington expedition off without

any delay, with or without the powder-boat, had been urged upon

General Butler, and he advised to so notify Admiral Porter.



The expedition finally got off on the 13th of December, and

arrived at the place of rendezvous, off New Inlet, near Fort

Fisher, on the evening of the 15th.  Admiral Porter arrived on

the evening of the 18th, having put in at Beaufort to get

ammunition for the monitors.  The sea becoming rough, making it

difficult to land troops, and the supply of water and coal being

about exhausted, the transport fleet put back to Beaufort to

replenish; this, with the state of the weather, delayed the

return to the place of rendezvous until the 24th.  The

powder-boat was exploded on the morning of the 24th, before the

return of General Butler from Beaufort; but it would seem, from

the notice taken of it in the Southern newspapers, that the

enemy were never enlightened as to the object of the explosion

until they were informed by the Northern press.



On the 25th a landing was effected without opposition, and a

reconnoissance, under Brevet Brigadier-General Curtis, pushed up

towards the fort.  But before receiving a full report of the

result of this reconnoissance, General Butler, in direct

violation of the instructions given, ordered the re-embarkation

of the troops and the return of the expedition.  The

re-embarkation was accomplished by the morning of the 27th.



On the return of the expedition officers and men among them

Brevet Major-General (then Brevet Brigadier-General) N. M.

Curtis, First-Lieutenant G. W. Ross, 117th Regiment New York

Volunteers, First-Lieutenant William H. Walling, and

Second-Lieutenant George Simpson, 142d New York Volunteers

voluntarily reported to me that when recalled they were nearly

into the fort, and, in their opinion, it could have been taken

without much loss.



Soon after the return of the expedition, I received a dispatch

from the Secretary of the Navy, and a letter from Admiral

Porter, informing me that the fleet was still off Fort Fisher,

and expressing the conviction that, under a proper leader, the

place could be taken.  The natural supposition with me was, that

when the troops abandoned the expedition, the navy would do so

also.  Finding it had not, however, I answered on the 30th of

December, advising Admiral Porter to hold on, and that I would

send a force and make another attempt to take the place.  This

time I selected Brevet Major-General (now Major-General) A. H.

Terry to command the expedition.  The troops composing it

consisted of the same that composed the former, with the

addition of a small brigade, numbering about one thousand five

hundred, and a small siege train.  The latter it was never found

necessary to land.  I communicated direct to the commander of the

expedition the following instructions:





"CITY POINT, VIRGINIA, January 3, 1865.



"GENERAL:  The expedition intrusted to your command has been

fitted out to renew the attempt to capture Fort Fisher, N. C.,

and Wilmington ultimately, if the fort falls.  You will then

proceed with as little delay as possible to the naval fleet

lying off Cape Fear River, and report the arrival of yourself

and command to Admiral D. D. Porter, commanding North Atlantic

Blockading Squadron.



"It is exceedingly desirable that the most complete

understanding should exist between yourself and the naval

commander.  I suggest, therefore, that you consult with Admiral

Porter freely, and get from him the part to be performed by each

branch of the public service, so that there may be unity of

action.  It would be well to have the whole programme laid down

in writing.  I have served with Admiral Porter, and know that

you can rely on his judgment and his nerve to undertake what he

proposes.  I would, therefore, defer to him as much as is

consistent with your own responsibilities.  The first object to

be attained is to get a firm position on the spit of land on

which Fort Fisher is built, from which you can operate against

that fort.  You want to look to the practicability of receiving

your supplies, and to defending yourself against superior forces

sent against you by any of the avenues left open to the enemy. If

such a position can be obtained, the siege of Fort Fisher will

not be abandoned until its reduction is accomplished, or another

plan of campaign is ordered from these headquarters.



"My own views are, that if you effect a landing, the navy ought

to run a portion of their fleet into Cape Fear River, while the

balance of it operates on the outside.  Land forces cannot

invest Fort Fisher, or cut it off from supplies or

reinforcements, while the river is in possession of the enemy.



"A siege-train will be loaded on vessels and sent to Fort

Monroe, in readiness to be sent to you if required.  All other

supplies can be drawn from Beaufort as you need them.



"Keep the fleet of vessels with you until your position is

assured.  When you find they can be spared, order them back, or

such of them as you can spare, to Fort Monroe, to report for

orders.



"In case of failure to effect a landing, bring your command back

to Beaufort, and report to these headquarters for further

instructions.  You will not debark at Beaufort until so directed.



"General Sheridan has been ordered to send a division of troops

to Baltimore and place them on sea-going vessels.  These troops

will be brought to Fort Monroe and kept there on the vessels

until you are heard from.  Should you require them, they will be

sent to you.



"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.

"BREVET MAJOR-GENERAL A. H. TERRY."





Lieutenant-Colonel C. B. Comstock, aide-de-camp (now brevet

brigadier-general), who accompanied the former expedition, was

assigned, in orders, as chief-engineer to this.



It will be seen that these instructions did not differ

materially from those given for the first expedition, and that

in neither instance was there an order to assault Fort Fisher.

This was a matter left entirely to the discretion of the

commanding officer.



The expedition sailed from Fort Monroe on the morning of the

6th, arriving at the rendezvous, off Beaufort, on the 8th,

where, owing to the difficulties of the weather, it lay until

the morning of the 12th, when it got under way and reached its

destination that evening.  Under cover of the fleet, the

disembarkation of the troops commenced on the morning of the

13th, and by three o'clock P.M. was completed without loss.  On

the 14th a reconnoissance was pushed to within five hundred

yards of Fort Fisher, and a small advance work taken possession

of and turned into a defensive line against any attempt that

might be made from the fort.  This reconnoissance disclosed the

fact that the front of the work had been seriously injured by

the navy fire.  In the afternoon of the 15th the fort was

assaulted, and after most desperate fighting was captured, with

its entire garrison and armament.  Thus was secured, by the

combined efforts of the navy and army, one of the most important

successes of the war.  Our loss was:  killed, one hundred and

ten; wounded, five hundred and thirty-six.  On the 16th and the

17th the enemy abandoned and blew up Fort Caswell and the works

on Smith's Island, which were immediately occupied by us.  This

gave us entire control of the mouth of the Cape Fear River.



At my request, Mayor-General B. F. Butler was relieved, and

Major-General E. O. C. Ord assigned to the Department of

Virginia and North Carolina.



The defence of the line of the Tennessee no longer requiring the

force which had beaten and nearly destroyed the only army now

threatening it, I determined to find other fields of operation

for General Thomas's surplus troops--fields from which they

would co-operate with other movements.  General Thomas was

therefore directed to collect all troops, not essential to hold

his communications at Eastport, in readiness for orders.  On the

7th of January, General Thomas was directed, if he was assured of

the departure of Hood south from Corinth, to send General

Schofield with his corps east with as little delay as

possible.  This direction was promptly complied with, and the

advance of the corps reached Washington on the 23d of the same

month, whence it was sent to Fort Fisher and New Bern.  On the

26th he was directed to send General A. J. Smith's command and a

division of cavalry to report to General Canby.  By the 7th of

February the whole force was en route for its destination.



The State of North Carolina was constituted into a military

department, and General Schofield assigned to command, and

placed under the orders of Major-General Sherman.  The following

instructions were given him:





"CITY POINT, VA., January 31, 1865.



"GENERAL:-- *    *    *    Your movements are intended as

co-operative with Sherman's through the States of South and

North Carolina.  The first point to be attained is to secure

Wilmington.  Goldsboro' will then be your objective point,

moving either from Wilmington or New Bern, or both, as you deem

best.  Should you not be able to reach Goldsboro', you will

advance on the line or lines of railway connecting that place

with the sea-coast--as near to it as you can, building the road

behind you.  The enterprise under you has two objects:  the

first is to give General Sherman material aid, if needed, in his

march north; the second, to open a base of supplies for him on

his line of march.  As soon, therefore, as you can determine

which of the two points, Wilmington or New Bern, you can best

use for throwing supplies from, to the interior, you will

commence the accumulation of twenty days' rations and forage for

sixty thousand men and twenty thousand animals.  You will get of

these as many as you can house and protect to such point in the

interior as you may be able to occupy.  I believe General Palmer

has received some instructions direct from General Sherman on the

subject of securing supplies for his army.  You will learn what

steps he has taken, and be governed in your requisitions

accordingly.  A supply of ordnance stores will also be necessary.



"Make all requisitions upon the chiefs of their respective

departments in the field with me at City Point.  Communicate

with me by every opportunity, and should you deem it necessary

at any time, send a special boat to Fortress Monroe, from which

point you can communicate by telegraph.



"The supplies referred to in these instructions are exclusive of

those required for your own command.



"The movements of the enemy may justify, or even make it your

imperative duty, to cut loose from your base, and strike for the

interior to aid Sherman.  In such case you will act on your own

judgment without waiting for instructions.  You will report,

however, what you purpose doing.  The details for carrying out

these instructions are necessarily left to you.  I would urge,

however, if I did not know that you are already fully alive to

the importance of it, prompt action.  Sherman may be looked for

in the neighborhood of Goldsboro' any time from the 22d to the

28th of February; this limits your time very materially.



"If rolling-stock is not secured in the capture of Wilmington,

it can be supplied from Washington.  A large force of railroad

men have already been sent to Beaufort, and other mechanics will

go to Fort Fisher in a day or two.  On this point I have informed

you by telegraph.



"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.

"MAJOR-GENERAL J. M. SCHOFIELD."





Previous to giving these instructions I had visited Fort Fisher,

accompanied by General Schofield, for the purpose of seeing for

myself the condition of things, and personally conferring with

General Terry and Admiral Porter as to what was best to be done.



Anticipating the arrival of General Sherman at Savannah his army

entirely foot-loose, Hood being then before Nashville, Tennessee,

the Southern railroads destroyed, so that it would take several

months to re-establish a through line from west to east, and

regarding the capture of Lee's army as the most important

operation towards closing the rebellion--I sent orders to

General Sherman on the 6th of December, that after establishing

a base on the sea-coast, with necessary garrison, to include all

his artillery and cavalry, to come by water to City Point with

the balance of his command.



On the 18th of December, having received information of the

defeat and utter rout of Hood's army by General Thomas, and

that, owing to the great difficulty of procuring ocean

transportation, it would take over two months to transport

Sherman's army, and doubting whether he might not contribute as

much towards the desired result by operating from where he was,

I wrote to him to that effect, and asked him for his views as to

what would be best to do.  A few days after this I received a

communication from General Sherman, of date 16th December,

acknowledging the receipt of my order of the 6th, and informing

me of his preparations to carry it into effect as soon as he

could get transportation.  Also that he had expected, upon

reducing Savannah, instantly to march to Columbia, South

Carolina, thence to Raleigh, and thence to report to me; but

that this would consume about six weeks' time after the fall of

Savannah, whereas by sea he could probably reach me by the

middle of January.  The confidence he manifested in this letter

of being able to march up and join me pleased me, and, without

waiting for a reply to my letter of the 18th, I directed him, on

the 28th of December, to make preparations to start as he

proposed, without delay, to break up the railroads in North and

South Carolina, and join the armies operating against Richmond

as soon as he could.



On the 21st of January I informed General Sherman that I had

ordered the 23d corps,  Major-General Schofield commanding,

east; that it numbered about twenty-one thousand men; that we

had at Fort Fisher, about eight thousand men; at New Bern, about

four thousand; that if Wilmington was captured, General Schofield

would go there; if not, he would be sent to New Bern; that, in

either event, all the surplus force at both points would move to

the interior towards Goldsboro', in co-operation with his

movement; that from either point railroad communication could be

run out; and that all these troops would be subject to his orders

as he came into communication with them.



In obedience to his instructions, General Schofield proceeded to

reduce Wilmington, North Carolina, in co-operation with the navy

under Admiral Porter, moving his forces up both sides of the

Cape Fear River.  Fort Anderson, the enemy's main defence on the

west bank of the river, was occupied on the morning of the 19th,

the enemy having evacuated it after our appearance before it.



After fighting on 20th and 21st, our troops entered Wilmington

on the morning of the 22d, the enemy having retreated towards

Goldsboro' during the night.  Preparations were at once made for

a movement on Goldsboro' in two columns--one from Wilmington, and

the other from New Bern--and to repair the railroad leading there

from each place, as well as to supply General Sherman by Cape

Fear River, towards Fayetteville, if it became necessary.  The

column from New Bern was attacked on the 8th of March, at Wise's

Forks, and driven back with the loss of several hundred

prisoners.  On the 11th the enemy renewed his attack upon our

intrenched position, but was repulsed with severe loss, and fell

back during the night.  On the 14th the Neuse River was crossed

and Kinston occupied, and on the 21st Goldsboro' was entered.

The column from Wilmington reached Cox's Bridge, on the Neuse

River, ten miles above Goldsboro', on the 22d.



By the 1st of February, General Sherman's whole army was in

motion from Savannah.  He captured Columbia, South Carolina, on

the 17th; thence moved on Goldsboro', North Carolina, via

Fayetteville, reaching the latter place on the 12th of March,

opening up communication with General Schofield by way of Cape

Fear River.  On the 15th he resumed his march on Goldsboro'.  He

met a force of the enemy at Averysboro', and after a severe fight

defeated and compelled it to retreat.  Our loss in this

engagement was about six hundred.  The enemy's loss was much

greater.  On the 18th the combined forces of the enemy, under

Joe Johnston, attacked his advance at Bentonville, capturing

three guns and driving it back upon the main body.  General

Slocum, who was in the advance ascertaining that the whole of

Johnston's army was in the front, arranged his troops on the

defensive, intrenched himself and awaited reinforcements, which

were pushed forward.  On the night of the 21st the enemy

retreated to Smithfield, leaving his dead and wounded in our

hands.  From there Sherman continued to Goldsboro', which place

had been occupied by General Schofield on the 21st (crossing the

Neuse River ten miles above there, at Cox's Bridge, where General

Terry had got possession and thrown a pontoon-bridge on the 22d),

thus forming a junction with the columns from New Bern and

Wilmington.



Among the important fruits of this campaign was the fall of

Charleston, South Carolina. It was evacuated by the enemy on the

night of the 17th of February, and occupied by our forces on the

18th.



On the morning of the 31st of January, General Thomas was

directed to send a cavalry expedition, under General Stoneman,

from East Tennessee, to penetrate South Carolina well down

towards Columbia, to destroy the railroads and military

resources of the country, and return, if he was able, to East

Tennessee by way of Salisbury, North Carolina, releasing our

prisoners there, if possible.  Of the feasibility of this

latter, however, General Stoneman was to judge.  Sherman's

movements, I had no doubt, would attract the attention of all

the force the enemy could collect, and facilitate the execution

of this.  General Stoneman was so late in making his start on

this expedition (and Sherman having passed out of the State of

South Carolina), on the 27th of February I directed General

Thomas to change his course, and order him to repeat his raid of

last fall, destroying the railroad towards Lynchburg as far as he

could.  This would keep him between our garrisons in East

Tennessee and the enemy.  I regarded it not impossible that in

the event of the enemy being driven from Richmond, he might fall

back to Lynchburg and attempt a raid north through East

Tennessee.  On the 14th of February the following communication

was sent to General Thomas:





"CITY POINT, VA., February 14, 1865.



"General Canby is preparing a movement from Mobile Bay against

Mobile and the interior of Alabama. His force will consist of

about twenty thousand men, besides A. J. Smith's command.  The

cavalry you have sent to Canby will be debarked at Vicksburg.

It, with the available cavalry already in that section, will

move from there eastward, in co-operation.  Hood's army has been

terribly reduced by the severe punishment you gave it in

Tennessee, by desertion consequent upon their defeat, and now by

the withdrawal of many of them to oppose Sherman.  (I take it a

large portion of the infantry has been so withdrawn.  It is so

asserted in the Richmond papers, and a member of the rebel

Congress said a few days since in a speech, that one-half of it

had been brought to South Carolina to oppose Sherman.)  This

being true, or even if it is not true, Canby's movement will

attract all the attention of the enemy, and leave the advance

from your standpoint easy.  I think it advisable, therefore,

that you prepare as much of a cavalry force as you can spare,

and hold it in readiness to go south.  The object would be

threefold:  first, to attract as much of the enemy's force as

possible, to insure success to Canby; second, to destroy the

enemy's line of communications and military resources; third, to

destroy or capture their forces brought into the field.

Tuscaloosa and Selma would probably be the points to direct the

expedition against.  This, however, would not be so important as

the mere fact of penetrating deep into Alabama.  Discretion

should be left to the officer commanding the expedition to go

where, according to the information he may receive, he will best

secure the objects named above.



"Now that your force has been so much depleted, I do not know

what number of men you can put into the field.  If not more than

five thousand men, however, all cavalry, I think it will be

sufficient.  It is not desirable that you should start this

expedition until the one leaving Vicksburg has been three or

four days out, or even a week.  I do not know when it will

start, but will inform you by telegraph as soon as I learn.  If

you should hear through other sources before hearing from me,

you can act on the information received.



"To insure success your cavalry should go with as little

wagon-train as possible, relying upon the country for

supplies.  I would also reduce the number of guns to a battery,

or the number of batteries, and put the extra teams to the guns

taken.  No guns or caissons should be taken with less than eight

horses.



"Please inform me by telegraph, on receipt of this, what force

you think you will be able to send under these directions.



"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.

"MAJOR-GENERAL G. H. THOMAS."





On the 15th, he was directed to start the expedition as soon

after the 20th as he could get it off.



I deemed it of the utmost importance, before a general movement

of the armies operating against Richmond, that all

communications with the city, north of James River, should be

cut off.  The enemy having withdrawn the bulk of his force from

the Shenandoah Valley and sent it south, or replaced troops sent

from Richmond, and desiring to reinforce Sherman, if practicable,

whose cavalry was greatly inferior in numbers to that of the

enemy, I determined to make a move from the Shenandoah, which,

if successful. would accomplish the first at least, and possibly

the latter of the objects.  I therefore telegraphed General

Sheridan as follows:





"CITY POINT, VA., February 20, 1865--1 P.M.



"GENERAL:--As soon as it is possible to travel, I think you will

have no difficulty about reaching Lychburg with a cavalry force

alone.   From there you could destroy the railroad and canal in

every direction, so as to be of no further use to the

rebellion.  Sufficient cavalry should be left behind to look

after Mosby's gang.  From Lynchburg, if information you might

get there would justify it, you will strike south, heading the

streams in Virgina to the westward of Danville, and push on and

join General Sherman.  This additional raid, with one now about

starting from East Tennessee under Stoneman, numbering four or

give thousand cavalry, one from Vicksburg, numbering seven or

eight thousand cavalry, one from Eastport, Mississippi, then

thousand cavalry, Canby from Mobile Bay, with about thirty-eight

thousand mixed troops, these three latter pushing for Tuscaloosa,

Selma, and Montgomery, and Sherman with a large army eating out

the vitals of South Carolina, is all that will be wanted to

leave mothing for the rebellion to stand upon.  I would advise

you to overcome great obstacles to accomplish this.  Charleston

was evacuated on Tuesday 1st.



"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.

"MAJOR-GENERAL P. H. SHERIDAN."





On the 25th I received a dispatch from General Sheridan,

inquiring where Sherman was aiming for, and if I could give him

definite information as to the points he might be expected to

move on, this side of Charlotte, North Carolina.  In answer, the

following telegram was sent him:





"CITY POINT, VA., February 25, 1865.



"GENERAL:--Sherman's movements will depend on the amount of

opposition he meets with from the enemy.  If strongly opposed,

he may possibly have to fall back to Georgetown, S. C., and fit

out for a new start.  I think, however, all danger for the

necessity of going to that point has passed.  I believe he has

passed Charlotte.  He may take Fayetteville on his way to

Goldsboro'.  If you reach Lynchburg, you will have to be guided

in your after movements by the information you obtain.  Before

you could possibly reach Sherman, I think you would find him

moving from Goldsboro' towards Raleigh, or engaging the enemy

strongly posted at one or the other of these places, with

railroad communications opened from his army to Wilmington or

New Bern.



"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.

"MAJOR-GENERAL P. H. SHERIDAN."





General Sheridan moved from Winchester on the 27th of February,

with two divisions of cavalry, numbering about five thousand

each.  On the 1st of March he secured the bridge, which the

enemy attempted to destroy, across the middle fork of the

Shenandoah, at Mount Crawford, and entered Staunton on the 2d,

the enemy having retreated to Waynesboro'.  Thence he pushed on

to Waynesboro', where he found the enemy in force in an

intrenched position, under General Early.  Without stopping to

make a reconnoissance, an immediate attack was made, the

position was carried, and sixteen hundred prisoners, eleven

pieces of artillery, with horses and caissons complete, two

hundred wagons and teams loaded with subsistence, and seventeen

battle-flags, were captured.  The prisoners, under an escort of

fifteen hundred men, were sent back to Winchester.  Thence he

marched on Charlottesville, destroying effectually the railroad

and bridges as he went, which place he reached on the 3d.  Here

he remained two days, destroying the railroad towards Richmond

and Lynchburg, including the large iron bridges over the north

and south forks of the Rivanna River and awaited the arrival of

his trains.  This necessary delay caused him to abandon the idea

of capturing Lynchburg.  On the morning of the 6th, dividing his

force into two columns, he sent one to Scottsville, whence it

marched up the James River Canal to New Market, destroying every

lock, and in many places the bank of the canal.  From here a

force was pushed out from this column to Duiguidsville, to

obtain possession of the bridge across the James River at that

place, but failed.  The enemy burned it on our approach.  The

enemy also burned the bridge across the river at

Hardwicksville.  The other column moved down the railroad

towards Lynchburg, destroying it as far as Amherst Court House,

sixteen miles from Lynchburg; thence across the country, uniting

with the column at New Market.  The river being very high, his

pontoons would not reach across it; and the enemy having

destroyed the bridges by which he had hoped to cross the river

and get on the South Side Railroad about Farmville, and destroy

it to Appomattox Court House, the only thing left for him was to

return to Winchester or strike a base at the White House.

Fortunately, he chose the latter.  From New Market he took up

his line of march, following the canal towards Richmond,

destroying every lock upon it and cutting the banks wherever

practicable, to a point eight miles east of Goochland,

concentrating the whole force at Columbia on the 10th.  Here he

rested one day, and sent through by scouts information of his

whereabouts and purposes, and a request for supplies to meet him

at White House, which reached me on the night of the 12th.  An

infantry force was immediately sent to get possession of White

House, and supplies were forwarded.  Moving from Columbia in a

direction to threaten Richmond, to near Ashland Station, he

crossed the Annas, and after having destroyed all the bridges

and many miles of the railroad, proceeded down the north bank of

the Pamunkey to White House, which place he reached on the 19th.



Previous to this the following communication was sent to General

Thomas:





"CITY POINT, VIRGINIA,

March 7, 1865--9.30 A.M.



"GENERAL:--I think it will be advisable now for you to repair

the railroad in East Tennessee, and throw a good force up to

Bull's Gap and fortify there.  Supplies at Knoxville could

always be got forward as required.  With Bull's Gap fortified,

you can occupy as outposts about all of East Tennessee, and be

prepared, if it should be required of you in the spring, to make

a campaign towards Lynchburg, or into North Carolina.  I do not

think Stoneman should break the road until he gets into

Virginia, unless it should be to cut off rolling-stock that may

be caught west of that.



"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.

"MAJOR-GENERAL G. H. THOMAS."





Thus it will be seen that in March, 1865, General Canby was

moving an adequate force against Mobile and the army defending

it under General Dick Taylor; Thomas was pushing out two large

and well-appointed cavalry expeditions--one from Middle

Tennessee under Brevet Major-General Wilson against the enemy's

vital points in Alabama, the other from East Tennessee, under

Major-General Stoneman, towards Lynchburg--and assembling the

remainder of his available forces, preparatory to commence

offensive operations from East Tennessee; General Sheridan's

cavalry was at White House; the armies of the Potomac and James

were confronting the enemy, under Lee, in his defences of

Richmond and Petersburg; General Sherman with his armies,

reinforced by that of General Schofield, was at Goldsboro';

General Pope was making preparations for a spring campaign

against the enemy under Kirby Smith and Price, west of the

Mississippi; and General Hancock was concentrating a force in

the vicinity of Winchester, Virginia, to guard against invasion

or to operate offensively, as might prove necessary.



After the long march by General Sheridan's cavalry over winter

roads, it was necessary to rest and refit at White House.  At

this time the greatest source of uneasiness to me was the fear

that the enemy would leave his strong lines about Petersburg and

Richmond for the purpose of uniting with Johnston, and before he

was driven from them by battle, or I was prepared to make an

effectual pursuit.  On the 24th of March, General Sheridan moved

from White House, crossed the James River at Jones's Landing, and

formed a junction with the Army of the Potomac in front of

Petersburg on the 27th.  During this move, General Ord sent

forces to cover the crossings of the Chickahominy.



On the 24th of March the following instructions for a general

movement of the armies operating against Richmond were issued:





"CITY POINT, VIRGINIA,

March 24, 1865.



"GENERAL:  On the 29th instant the armies operating against

Richmond will be moved by our left, for the double purpose of

turning the enemy out of his present position around Petersburg,

and to insure the success of the cavalry under General Sheridan,

which will start at the same time, in its efforts to reach and

destroy the South Side and Danville railroads.  Two corps of the

Army of the Potomac will be moved at first in two columns, taking

the two roads crossing Hatcher's Run, nearest where the present

line held by us strikes that stream, both moving towards

Dinwiddie Court House.



"The cavalry under General Sheridan, joined by the division now

under General Davies, will move at the same time by the Weldon

Road and the Jerusalem Plank Road, turning west from the latter

before crossing the Nottoway, and west with the whole column

before reaching Stony Creek.  General Sheridan will then move

independently, under other instructions which will be given

him.  All dismounted cavalry belonging to the Army of the

Potomac, and the dismounted cavalry from the Middle Military

Division not required for guarding property belonging to their

arm of service, will report to Brigadier-General Benham, to be

added to the defences of City Point.  Major-General Parke will

be left in command of all the army left for holding the lines

about Petersburg and City Point, subject of course to orders

from the commander of the Army of the Potomac.  The 9th army

corps will be left intact, to hold the present line of works so

long as the whole line now occupied by us is held.  If, however,

the troops to the left of the 9th corps are withdrawn, then the

left of the corps may be thrown back so as to occupy the

position held by the army prior to the capture of the Weldon

Road.  All troops to the left of the 9th corps will be held in

readiness to move at the shortest notice by such route as may be

designated when the order is given.



"General Ord will detach three divisions, two white and one

colored, or so much of them as he can, and hold his present

lines, and march for the present left of the Army of the

Potomac.  In the absence of further orders, or until further

orders are given, the white divisions will follow the left

column of the Army of the Potomac, and the colored division the

right column.  During the movement Major-General Weitzel will be

left in command of all the forces remaining behind from the Army

of the James.



"The movement of troops from the Army of the James will commence

on the night of the 27th instant.  General Ord will leave behind

the minimum number of cavalry necessary for picket duty, in the

absence of the main army.  A cavalry expedition, from General

Ord's command, will also be started from Suffolk, to leave there

on Saturday, the 1st of April, under Colonel Sumner, for the

purpose of cutting the railroad about Hicksford.  This, if

accomplished, will have to be a surprise, and therefore from

three to five hundred men will be sufficient.  They should,

however, be supported by all the infantry that can be spared

from Norfolk and Portsmouth, as far out as to where the cavalry

crosses the Blackwater.  The crossing should probably be at

Uniten.  Should Colonel Sumner succeed in reaching the Weldon

Road, he will be instructed to do all the damage possible to the

triangle of roads between Hicksford, Weldon, and Gaston.  The

railroad bridge at Weldon being fitted up for the passage of

carriages, it might be practicable to destroy any accumulation

of supplies the enemy may have collected south of the Roanoke.

All the troops will move with four days' rations in haversacks

and eight days' in wagons.  To avoid as much hauling as

possible, and to give the Army of the James the same number of

days' supplies with the Army of the Potomac, General Ord will

direct his commissary and quartermaster to have sufficient

supplies delivered at the terminus of the road to fill up in

passing.  Sixty rounds of ammunition per man will be taken in

wagons, and as much grain as the transportation on hand will

carry, after taking the specified amount of other supplies.  The

densely wooded country in which the army has to operate making

the use of much artillery impracticable, the amount taken with

the army will be reduced to six or eight guns to each division,

at the option of the army commanders.



"All necessary preparations for carrying these directions into

operation may be commenced at once.  The reserves of the 9th

corps should be massed as much as possible.  While I would not

now order an unconditional attack on the enemy's line by them,

they should be ready and should make the attack if the enemy

weakens his line in their front, without waiting for orders.  In

case they carry the line, then the whole of the 9th corps could

follow up so as to join or co-operate with the balance of the

army.  To prepare for this, the 9th corps will have rations

issued to them, same as the balance of the army.  General

Weitzel will keep vigilant watch upon his front, and if found at

all practicable to break through at any point, he will do so.  A

success north of the James should be followed up with great

promptness.  An attack will not be feasible unless it is found

that the enemy has detached largely.  In that case it may be

regarded as evident that the enemy are relying upon their local

reserves principally for the defence of Richmond.  Preparations

may be made for abandoning all the line north of the James,

except inclosed works only to be abandoned, however, after a

break is made in the lines of the enemy.



"By these instructions a large part of the armies operating

against Richmond is left behind.  The enemy, knowing this, may,

as an only chance, strip their lines to the merest skeleton, in

the hope of advantage not being taken of it, while they hurl

everything against the moving column, and return.  It cannot be

impressed too strongly upon commanders of troops left in the

trenches not to allow this to occur without taking advantage of

it.  The very fact of the enemy coming out to attack, if he does

so, might be regarded as almost conclusive evidence of such a

weakening of his lines.  I would have it particularly enjoined

upon corps commanders that, in case of an attack from the enemy,

those not attacked are not to wait for orders from the commanding

officer of the army to which they belong, but that they will move

promptly, and notify the commander of their action.  I would also

enjoin the same action on the part of division commanders when

other parts of their corps are engaged.  In like manner, I would

urge the importance of following up a repulse of the enemy.



"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.

"MAJOR-GENERALS MEADE, ORD, AND SHERIDAN."





Early on the morning of the 25th the enemy assaulted our lines

in front of the 9th corps (which held from the Appomattox River

towards our left), and carried Fort Stedman, and a part of the

line to the right and left of it, established themselves and

turned the guns of the fort against us, but our troops on either

flank held their ground until the reserves were brought up, when

the enemy was driven back with a heavy loss in killed and

wounded, and one thousand nine hundred prisoners.  Our loss was

sixty-eight killed, three hundred and thirty-seven wounded, and

five hundred and six missing.  General Meade at once ordered the

other corps to advance and feel the enemy in their respective

fronts.  Pushing forward, they captured and held the enemy's

strongly intrenched picket-line in front of the 2d and 6th

corps, and eight hundred and thirty-four prisoners.  The enemy

made desperate attempts to retake this line, but without

success.  Our loss in front of these was fifty-two killed, eight

hundred and sixty-four wounded, and two hundred and seven

missing.  The enemy's loss in killed and wounded was far greater.



General Sherman having got his troops all quietly in camp about

Goldsboro', and his preparations for furnishing supplies to them

perfected, visited me at City Point on the 27th of March, and

stated that he would be ready to move, as he had previously

written me, by the 10th of April, fully equipped and rationed

for twenty days, if it should become necessary to bring his

command to bear against Lee's army, in co-operation with our

forces in front of Richmond and Petersburg.  General Sherman

proposed in this movement to threaten Raleigh, and then, by

turning suddenly to the right, reach the Roanoke at Gaston or

thereabouts, whence he could move on to the Richmond and

Danville Railroad, striking it in the vicinity of Burkesville,

or join the armies operating against Richmond, as might be

deemed best.  This plan he was directed to carry into execution,

if he received no further directions in the meantime.  I

explained to him the movement I had ordered to commence on the

29th of March.  That if it should not prove as entirely

successful as I hoped, I would cut the cavalry loose to destroy

the Danville and South Side railroads, and thus deprive the

enemy of further supplies, and also to prevent the rapid

concentration of Lee's and Johnston's armies.



I had spent days of anxiety lest each morning should bring the

report that the enemy had retreated the night before.  I was

firmly convinced that Sherman's crossing the Roanoke would be

the signal for Lee to leave.  With Johnston and him combined, a

long, tedious, and expensive campaign, consuming most of the

summer, might become necessary.  By moving out I would put the

army in better condition for pursuit, and would at least, by the

destruction of the Danville Road, retard the concentration of the

two armies of Lee and Johnston, and cause the enemy to abandon

much material that he might otherwise save.  I therefore

determined not to delay the movement ordered.



On the night of the 27th, Major-General Ord, with two divisions

of the 24th corps, Major-General Gibbon commanding, and one

division of the 25th corps, Brigadier-General Birney commanding,

and MacKenzie's cavalry, took up his line of march in pursuance

of the foregoing instructions, and reached the position assigned

him near Hatcher's Run on the morning of the 29th.  On the 28th

the following instructions were given to General Sheridan:





"CITY POINT, VA., March 28, 1865.



"GENERAL:--The 5th army corps will move by the Vaughn Road at

three A.M. to-morrow morning.  The 2d moves at about nine A.M.,

having but about three miles to march to reach the point

designated for it to take on the right of the 5th corps, after

the latter reaching Dinwiddie Court House.  Move your cavalry at

as early an hour as you can, and without being confined to any

particular road or roads.  You may go out by the nearest roads

in rear of the 5th corps, pass by its left, and passing near to

or through Dinwiddie, reach the right and rear of the enemy as

soon as you can.  It is not the intention to attack the enemy in

his intrenched position, but to force him out, if possible.

Should he come out and attack us, or get himself where he can be

attacked, move in with your entire force in your own way, and

with the full reliance that the army will engage or follow, as

circumstances will dictate.  I shall be on the field, and will

probably be able to communicate with you.  Should I not do so,

and you find that the enemy keeps within his main intrenched

line, you may cut loose and push for the Danville Road.  If you

find it practicable, I would like you to cross the South Side

Road, between Petersburg and Burkesville, and destroy it to some

extent.  I would not advise much detention, however, until you

reach the Danville Road, which I would like you to strike as

near to the Appomattox as possible.  Make your destruction on

that road as complete as possible.  You can then pass on to the

South Side Road, west of Burkesville, and destroy that in like

manner.



"After having accomplished the destruction of the two railroads,

which are now the only avenues of supply to Lee's army, you may

return to this army, selecting your road further south, or you

may go on into North Carolina and join General Sherman.  Should

you select the latter course, get the information to me as early

as possible, so that I may send orders to meet you at Goldsboro'.



"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.

"MAJOR-GENERAL P. H. SHERIDAN."





On the morning of the 29th the movement commenced.  At night the

cavalry was at Dinwiddie Court House, and the left of our

infantry line extended to the Quaker Road, near its intersection

with the Boydton Plank Road.  The position of the troops from

left to right was as follows:  Sheridan, Warren, Humphreys, Ord,

Wright, Parke.



Everything looked favorable to the defeat of the enemy and the

capture of Petersburg and Richmond, if the proper effort was

made.  I therefore addressed the following communication to

General Sheridan, having previously informed him verbally not to

cut loose for the raid contemplated in his orders until he

received notice from me to do so:





"GRAVELLY CREEK, March 29, 1865.



"GENERAL:--Our line is now unbroken from the Appomattox to

Dinwiddie.  We are all ready, however, to give up all, from the

Jerusalem Plank Road to Hatcher's Run, whenever the forces can

be used advantageously.  After getting into line south of

Hatcher's, we pushed forward to find the enemy's position.

General Griffin was attacked near where the Quaker Road

intersects the Boydton Road, but repulsed it easily, capturing

about one hundred men.  Humphreys reached Dabney's Mill, and was

pushing on when last heard from.



"I now feel like ending the matter, if it is possible to do so,

before going back.  I do not want you, therefore, to cut loose

and go after the enemy's roads at present.  In the morning push

around the enemy, if you can, and get on to his right rear.  The

movements of the enemy's cavalry may, of course, modify your

action.  We will act all together as one army here, until it is

seen what can be done with the enemy.  The signal-officer at

Cobb's Hill reported, at half-past eleven A.M., that a cavalry

column had passed that point from Richmond towards Petersburg,

taking forty minutes to pass.



"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.

"MAJOR-GENERAL P. H. SHERIDAN."





From the night of the 29th to the morning of the 31st the rain

fell in such torrents as to make it impossible to move a wheeled

vehicle, except as corduroy roads were laid in front of them.

During the 30th, Sheridan advanced from Dinwiddie Court House

towards Five Forks, where he found the enemy in full force.

General Warren advanced and extended his line across the Boydton

Plank Road to near the White Oak Road, with a view of getting

across the latter; but, finding the enemy strong in his front

and extending beyond his left, was directed to hold on where he

was, and fortify.  General Humphreys drove the enemy from his

front into his main line on the Hatcher, near Burgess's Mills.

Generals Ord, Wright, and Parke made examinations in their

fronts to determine the feasibility of an assault on the enemy's

lines.  The two latter reported favorably.  The enemy confronting

us as he did, at every point from Richmond to our extreme left, I

conceived his lines must be weakly held, and could be penetrated

if my estimate of his forces was correct.  I determined,

therefore, to extend our line no farther, but to reinforce

General Sheridan with a corps of infantry, and thus enable him

to cut loose and turn the enemy's right flank, and with the

other corps assault the enemy's lines.  The result of the

offensive effort of the enemy the week before, when he assaulted

Fort Stedman, particularly favored this.  The enemy's

intrenched  picket-line captured by us at that time threw the

lines occupied by the belligerents so close together at some

points that it was but a moment's run from one to the other.

Preparations were at once made to relieve General Humphreys's

corps, to report to General Sheridan; but the condition of the

roads prevented immediate movement.  On the morning of the 31st,

General Warren reported favorably to getting possession of the

White Oak Road, and was directed to do so.  To accomplish this,

he moved with one division, instead of his whole corps, which

was attacked by the enemy in superior force and driven back on

the 2d division before it had time to form, and it, in turn,

forced back upon the 3d division, when the enemy was checked.  A

division of the 2d corps was immediately sent to his support, the

enemy driven back with heavy loss, and possession of the White

Oak Road gained.  Sheridan advanced, and with a portion of his

cavalry got possession of the Five Forks; but the enemy, after

the affair with the 5th corps, reinforced the rebel cavalry,

defending that point with infantry, and forced him back towards

Dinwiddie Court House.  Here General Sheridan displayed great

generalship.  Instead of retreating with his whole command on

the main army, to tell the story of superior forces encountered,

he deployed his cavalry on foot, leaving only mounted men enough

to take charge of the horses.  This compelled the enemy to

deploy over a vast extent of wooded and broken country, and made

his progress slow.  At this juncture he dispatched to me what had

taken place, and that he was dropping back slowly on Dinwiddie

Court House.  General Mackenzie's cavalry and one division of

the 5th corps were immediately ordered to his assistance.  Soon

after receiving a report from General Meade that Humphreys could

hold our position on the Boydton Road, and that the other two

divisions of the 5th corps could go to Sheridan, they were so

ordered at once.  Thus the operations of the day necessitated

the sending of Warren, because of his accessibility, instead of

Humphreys, as was intended, and precipitated intended

movements.  On the morning of the 1st of April, General

Sheridan, reinforced by General Warren, drove the enemy back on

Five Forks, where, late in the evening, he assaulted and carried

his strongly fortified position, capturing all his artillery and

between five and six thousand prisoners.



About the close of this battle, Brevet Major-General Charles

Griffin relieved Major-General Warren in command of the 5th

corps.  The report of this reached me after nightfall.  Some

apprehensions filled my mind lest the enemy might desert his

lines during the night, and by falling upon General Sheridan

before assistance could reach him, drive him from his position

and open the way for retreat.  To guard against this, General

Miles's division of Humphreys's corps was sent to reinforce him,

and a bombardment was commenced and kept up until four o'clock in

the morning (April 2), when an assault was ordered on the enemy's

lines.  General Wright penetrated the lines with his whole corps,

sweeping everything before him, and to his left towards Hatcher's

Run, capturing many guns and several thousand prisoners.  He was

closely followed by two divisions of General Ord's command,

until he met the other division of General Ord's that had

succeeded in forcing the enemy's lines near Hatcher's Run.

Generals Wright and Ord immediately swung to the right, and

closed all of the enemy on that side of them in Petersburg,

while General Humphreys pushed forward with two divisions and

joined General Wright on the left.  General Parke succeeded in

carrying the enemy's main line, capturing guns and prisoners,

but was unable to carry his inner line.  General Sheridan being

advised of the condition of affairs, returned General Miles to

his proper command.  On reaching the enemy's lines immediately

surrounding Petersburg, a portion of General Gibbon's corps, by

a most gallant charge, captured two strong inclosed works--the

most salient and commanding south of Petersburg--thus materially

shortening the line of investment necessary for taking in the

city.  The enemy south of Hatcher's Run retreated westward to

Sutherland's Station, where they were overtaken by Miles's

division.  A severe engagement ensued, and lasted until both his

right and left flanks were threatened by the approach of General

Sheridan, who was moving from Ford's Station towards Petersburg,

and a division sent by General Meade from the front of

Petersburg, when he broke in the utmost confusion, leaving in

our hands his guns and many prisoners.  This force retreated by

the main road along the Appomattox River.  During the night of

the 2d the enemy evacuated Petersburg and Richmond, and

retreated towards Danville.  On the morning of the 3d pursuit

was commenced.  General Sheridan pushed for the Danville Road,

keeping near the Appomattox, followed by General Meade with the

2d and 6th corps, while General Ord moved for Burkesville, along

the South Side Road; the 9th corps stretched along that road

behind him.  On the 4th, General Sheridan struck the Danville

Road near Jetersville, where he learned that Lee was at Amelia

Court House.  He immediately intrenched himself and awaited the

arrival of General Meade, who reached there the next day.

General Ord reached Burkesville on the evening of the 5th.



On the morning of the 5th, I addressed Major-General Sherman the

following communication:





"WILSON'S STATION, April 5, 1865.



"GENERAL:  All indications now are that Lee will attempt to

reach Danville with the remnant of his force.  Sheridan, who was

up with him last night, reports all that is left, horse, foot,

and dragoons, at twenty thousand, much demoralized.  We hope to

reduce this number one-half.  I shall push on to Burkesville,

and if a stand is made at Danville, will in a very few days go

there.  If you can possibly do so, push on from where you are,

and let us see if we cannot finish the job with Lee's and

Johnston's armies.  Whether it will be better for you to strike

for Greensboro', or nearer to Danville, you will be better able

to judge when you receive this.  Rebel armies now are the only

strategic points to strike at.



"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.

"MAJOR-GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN."





On the morning of the 6th, it was found that General Lee was

moving west of Jetersville, towards Danville.  General Sheridan

moved with his cavalry (the 5th corps having been returned to

General Meade on his reaching Jetersville) to strike his flank,

followed by the 6th corps, while the 2d and 5th corps pressed

hard after, forcing him to abandon several hundred wagons and

several pieces of artillery.  General Ord advanced from

Burkesville towards Farmville, sending two regiments of infantry

and a squadron of cavalry, under Brevet Brigadier-General

Theodore Read, to reach and destroy the bridges.  This advance

met the head of Lee's column near Farmville, which it heroically

attacked and detained until General Read was killed and his small

force overpowered.  This caused a delay in the enemy's movements,

and enabled General Ord to get well up with the remainder of his

force, on meeting which, the enemy immediately intrenched

himself.  In the afternoon, General Sheridan struck the enemy

south of Sailors' Creek, captured sixteen pieces of artillery

and about four hundred wagons, and detained him until the 6th

corps got up, when a general attack of infantry and cavalry was

made, which resulted in the capture of six or seven thousand

prisoners, among whom were many general officers.  The movements

of the 2d corps and General Ord's command contributed greatly to

the day's success.



On the morning of the 7th the pursuit was renewed, the cavalry,

except one division, and the 5th corps moving by Prince Edward's

Court House; the 6th corps, General Ord's command, and one

division of cavalry, on Farmville; and the 2d corps by the High

Bridge Road.  It was soon found that the enemy had crossed to

the north side of the Appomattox; but so close was the pursuit,

that the 2d corps got possession of the common bridge at High

Bridge before the enemy could destroy it, and immediately

crossed over.  The 6th corps and a division of cavalry crossed

at Farmville to its support.



Feeling now that General Lee's chance of escape was utterly

hopeless, I addressed him the following communication from

Farmville:





"April 7, 1865.



"GENERAL--The result of the last week must convince you of the

hopelessness of further resistance on the part of the Army of

Northern Virginia in this struggle.  I feel that it is so, and

regard it as my duty to shift from myself the responsibility of

any further effusion of blood, by asking of you the surrender of

that portion of the Confederate States army known as the Army of

Northern Virginia.



"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.

"GENERAL R. E. LEE."





Early on the morning of the 8th, before leaving, I received at

Farmville the following:





"April 7, 1865.



"GENERAL:  I have received your note of this date.  Though not

entertaining the opinion you express on the hopelessness of

further resistance on the part of the Army of Northern Virginia,

I reciprocate your desire to avoid useless effusion of blood, and

therefore, before considering your proposition, ask the terms you

will offer on condition of its surrender.



"R. E. LEE, General.

"LIEUTENANT-GENERAL U. S. GRANT."





To this I immediately replied:





"April 8, 1865.



"GENERAL:--Your note of last evening, in reply to mine of same

date, asking the condition on which I will accept the surrender

of the Army of Northern Virginia, is just received.  In reply, I

would say, that peace being my great desire, there is but one

condition I would insist upon--namely, That the men and officers

surrendered shall be disqualified for taking up arms again

against the Government of the United States until properly

exchanged.  I will meet you, or will designate officers to meet

any officers you may name for the same purpose, at any point

agreeable to you, for the purpose of arranging definitely the

terms upon which the surrender of the Army of the Northern

Virginia will be received.



"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.

"GENERAL R. E. LEE."





Early on the morning of the 8th the pursuit was resumed. General

Meade followed north of the Appomattox, and General Sheridan,

with all the cavalry, pushed straight ahead for Appomattox

Station, followed by General Ord's command and the 5th corps.

During the day General Meade's advance had considerable fighting

with the enemy's rear-guard, but was unable to bring on a general

engagement.  Late in the evening General Sheridan struck the

railroad at Appomattox Station, drove the enemy from there, and

captured twenty-five pieces of artillery, a hospital train, and

four trains of cars loaded with supplies for Lee's army.  During

this day I accompanied General Meade's column, and about midnight

received the following communication from General Lee:





April 8, 1865.



"GENERAL:--I received, at a late hour, your note of to-day.  In

mine of yesterday I did not intend to propose the surrender of

the Army of Northern Virginia, but to ask the terms of your

proposition.  To be frank, I do not think the emergency has

arisen to call for the surrender of this army; but as the

restoration of peace should be the sole object of all, I desired

to know whether your proposals would lead to that end.  I cannot,

therefore, meet you with a view to the surrender of the Army of

Northern Virginia; but as far as your proposal may affect the

Confederate States forces under my command, and tend to the

restoration of peace, I should be pleased to meet you at ten

A.M. to-morrow on the old stage-road to Richmond, between the

picket-lines of the two armies.



"R. E. LEE, General.

"LIEUTENANT-GENERAL U. S. GRANT."





Early on the morning of the 9th I returned him an answer as

follows, and immediately started to join the column south of the

Appomattox:





"April 9, 1865.



"GENERAL:--Your note of yesterday is received.  I have no

authority to treat on the subject of peace; the meeting proposed

for ten A.M. to-day could lead to no good.  I will state,

however, general, that I am equally anxious for peace with

yourself, and the whole North entertains the same feeling.  The

terms upon which peace can be had are well understood.  By the

South laying down their arms they will hasten that most

desirable event, save thousands of human lives, and hundreds of

millions of property not yet destroyed.  Seriously hoping that

all our difficulties may be settled without the loss of another

life, I subscribe myself, etc.



"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.

"GENERAL R. E. LEE."





On this morning of the 9th, General Ord's command and the 5th

corps reached Appomattox Station just as the enemy was making a

desperate effort to break through our cavalry.  The infantry was

at once thrown in.  Soon after a white flag was received,

requesting a suspension of hostilities pending negotiations for

a surrender.



Before reaching General Sheridan's headquarters, I received the

following from General Lee:





"April 9, 1865.



"GENERAL:--I received your note of this morning on the

picket-line, whither I had come to meet you, and ascertain

definitely what terms were embraced in your proposal of

yesterday with reference to the surrender of this army.  I now

ask an interview, in accordance with the offer contained in your

letter of yesterday, for that purpose.



"R. E. LEE, General.

"LIEUTENANT-GENERAL U. S. GRANT."





The interview was held at Appomattox Court-House, the result of

which is set forth in the following correspondence:





APPOMATTOX COURT-HOUSE, Virginia, April 9, 1865.



"GENERAL:  In accordance with the substance of my letter to you

of the 8th instant, I propose to receive the surrender of the

Army of Northern Virginia on the following terms, to wit:  Rolls

of all the officers and men to be made in duplicate, one copy to

be given to an officer to be designated by me, the other to be

retained by such officer or officers as you may designate.  The

officers to give their individual paroles not to take up arms

against the Government of the United States until properly

exchanged; and each company or regimental commander sign a like

parole for the men of their commands.  The arms, artillery, and

public property to be parked and stacked, and turned over to the

officers appointed by me to receive them.  This will not embrace

the side-arms of the officers, nor their private horses or

baggage.  This done, each officer and man will be allowed to

return to his home, not to be disturbed by United States

authority so long as they observe their paroles and the laws in

force where they may reside.



"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.

"GENERAL R. E. LEE."





"HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, April 9, 1865.



"GENERAL:  I have received your letter of this date containing

the terms of surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia as

proposed by you.  As they are substantially the same as those

expressed in your letter of the 8th instant, they are

accepted.  I will proceed to designate the proper officers to

carry the stipulations into effect.



"R. E. LEE, General.

"LIEUTENANT-GENERAL U. S. GRANT."





The command of Major-General Gibbon, the 5th army corps under

Griffin, and Mackenzie's cavalry, were designated to remain at

Appomattox Court-House until the paroling of the surrendered

army was completed, and to take charge of the public property.

The remainder of the army immediately returned to the vicinity

of Burkesville.



General Lee's great influence throughout the whole South caused

his example to be followed, and to-day the result is that the

armies lately under his leadership are at their homes, desiring

peace and quiet, and their arms are in the hands of our ordnance

officers.



On the receipt of my letter of the 5th, General Sherman moved

directly against Joe Johnston, who retreated rapidly on and

through Raleigh, which place General Sherman occupied on the

morning of the 13th.  The day preceding, news of the surrender

of General Lee reached him at Smithfield.



On the 14th a correspondence was opened between General Sherman

and General Johnston, which resulted on the 18th in an agreement

for a suspension of hostilities, and a memorandum or basis for

peace, subject to the approval of the President.  This agreement

was disapproved by the President on the 21st, which disapproval,

together with your instructions, was communicated to General

Sherman by me in person on the morning of the 24th, at Raleigh,

North Carolina, in obedience to your orders.  Notice was at once

given by him to General Johnston for the termination of the truce

that had been entered into.  On the 25th another meeting between

them was agreed upon, to take place on the 26th, which

terminated in the surrender and disbandment of Johnston's army

upon substantially the same terms as were given to General Lee.



The expedition under General Stoneman from East Tennessee got

off on the 20th of March, moving by way of Boone, North

Carolina, and struck the railroad at Wytheville, Chambersburg,

and Big Lick.  The force striking it at Big Lick pushed on to

within a few miles of Lynchburg, destroying the important

bridges, while with the main force he effectually destroyed it

between New River and Big Lick, and then turned for Greensboro',

on the North Carolina Railroad; struck that road and destroyed

the bridges between Danville and Greensboro', and between

Greensboro' and the Yadkin, together with the depots of supplies

along it, and captured four hundred prisoners.  At Salisbury he

attacked and defeated a force of the enemy under General

Gardiner, capturing fourteen pieces of artillery and one

thousand three hundred and sixty-four prisoners, and destroyed

large amounts of army stores.  At this place he destroyed

fifteen miles of railroad and the bridges towards Charlotte.

Thence he moved to Slatersville.



General Canby, who had been directed in January to make

preparations for a movement from Mobile Bay against Mobile and

the interior of Alabama, commenced his movement on the 20th of

March.  The 16th corps, Major-General A. J. Smith commanding,

moved from Fort Gaines by water to Fish River; the 13th corps,

under Major-General Gordon Granger, moved from Fort Morgan and

joined the 16th corps on Fish River, both moving thence on

Spanish Fort and investing it on the 27th; while Major-General

Steele's command moved from Pensacola, cut the railroad leading

from Tensas to Montgomery, effected a junction with them, and

partially invested Fort Blakely.  After a severe bombardment of

Spanish Fort, a part of its line was carried on the 8th of

April.  During the night the enemy evacuated the fort.  Fort

Blakely was carried by assault on the 9th, and many prisoners

captured; our loss was considerable.  These successes

practically opened to us the Alabama River, and enabled us to

approach Mobile from the north.  On the night of the 11th the

city was evacuated, and was taken possession of by our forces on

the morning of the 12th.



The expedition under command of Brevet Major-General Wilson,

consisting of twelve thousand five hundred mounted men, was

delayed by rains until March 22d, when it moved from Chickasaw,

Alabama.  On the 1st of April, General Wilson encountered the

enemy in force under Forrest near Ebenezer Church, drove him in

confusion, captured three hundred prisoners and three guns, and

destroyed the central bridge over the Cahawba River.  On the 2d

he attacked and captured the fortified city of Selma, defended

by Forrest, with seven thousand men and thirty-two guns,

destroyed the arsenal, armory, naval foundry, machine-shops,

vast quantities of stores, and captured three thousand

prisoners.  On the 4th he captured and destroyed Tuscaloosa.  On

the 10th he crossed the Alabama River, and after sending

information of his operations to General Canby, marched on

Montgomery, which place he occupied on the 14th, the enemy

having abandoned it.  At this place many stores and five

steamboats fell into our hands.  Thence a force marched direct

on Columbus, and another on West Point, both of which places

were assaulted and captured on the 16th.  At the former place we

got one thousand five hundred prisoners and fifty-two field-guns,

destroyed two gunboats, the navy yard, foundries, arsenal, many

factories, and much other public property.  At the latter place

we got three hundred prisoners, four guns, and destroyed

nineteen locomotives and three hundred cars.  On the 20th he

took possession of Macon, Georgia, with sixty field-guns, one

thousand two hundred militia, and five generals, surrendered by

General Howell Cobb.  General Wilson, hearing that Jeff. Davis

was trying to make his escape, sent forces in pursuit and

succeeded in capturing him on the morning of May 11th.



On the 4th day of May, General Dick Taylor surrendered to

General Canby all the remaining rebel forces east of the

Mississippi.



A force sufficient to insure an easy triumph over the enemy

under Kirby Smith, west of the Mississippi, was immediately put

in motion for Texas, and Major-General Sheridan designated for

its immediate command; but on the 26th day of May, and before

they reached their destination, General Kirby Smith surrendered

his entire command to Major-General Canby.  This surrender did

not take place, however, until after the capture of the rebel

President and Vice-President; and the bad faith was exhibited of

first disbanding most of his army and permitting an

indiscriminate plunder of public property.



Owing to the report that many of those lately in arms against

the government had taken refuge upon the soil of Mexico,

carrying with them arms rightfully belonging to the United

States, which had been surrendered to us by agreement among them

some of the leaders who had surrendered in person and the

disturbed condition of affairs on the Rio Grande, the orders for

troops to proceed to Texas were not changed.



There have been severe combats, raids, expeditions, and

movements to defeat the designs and purposes of the enemy, most

of them reflecting great credit on our arms, and which

contributed greatly to our final triumph, that I have not

mentioned.  Many of these will be found clearly set forth in the

reports herewith submitted; some in the telegrams and brief

dispatches announcing them, and others, I regret to say, have

not as yet been officially reported.



For information touching our Indian difficulties, I would

respectfully refer to the reports of the commanders of

departments in which they have occurred.



It has been my fortune to see the armies of both the West and

the East fight battles, and from what I have seen I know there

is no difference in their fighting qualities.  All that it was

possible for men to do in battle they have done.  The Western

armies commenced their battles in the Mississippi Valley, and

received the final surrender of the remnant of the principal

army opposed to them in North Carolina.  The armies of the East

commenced their battles on the river from which the Army of the

Potomac derived its name, and received the final surrender of

their old antagonists at Appomattox Court House, Virginia.  The

splendid achievements of each have nationalized our victories

removed all sectional jealousies (of which we have unfortunately

experienced too much), and the cause of crimination and

recrimination that might have followed had either section failed

in its duty.  All have a proud record, and all sections can well

congratulate themselves and each other for having done their

full share in restoring the supremacy of law over every foot of

territory belonging to the United States.  Let them hope for

perpetual peace and harmony with that enemy, whose manhood,

however mistaken the cause, drew forth such herculean deeds of

valor.



I have the honor to be,

Very respectfully, your obedient servant, U. S. GRANT,

General Twiggs, his division commander, or General Taylor, to

the effect that he was nearly out of ammunition and must have

more sent to him, or otherwise be reinforced.  Deeming the

return dangerous he did not like to order any one to carry it,

so he called for a volunteer.  Lieutenant Grant offered his

services, which were accepted.--PUBLISHERS.

(*4) NOTE.--It had been a favorite idea with General Scott for a

great many years before the Mexican war to have established in

the United States a soldiers' home, patterned after something of

the kind abroad, particularly, I believe, in France.  He

recommended this uniformly, or at least frequently, in his

annual reports to the Secretary of War, but never got any

hearing.  Now, as he had conquered the state, he made

assessments upon the different large towns and cities occupied

by our troops, in proportion to their capacity to pay, and

appointed officers to receive the money.  In addition to the sum

thus realized he had derived, through capture at Cerro Gordo,

sales of captured government tobacco, etc., sums which swelled

the fund to a total of about $220,000.  Portions of this fund

were distributed among the rank and file, given to the wounded

in hospital, or applied in other ways, leaving a balance of some

$118,000 remaining unapplied at the close of the war.  After the

war was over and the troops all home, General Scott applied to

have this money, which had never been turned into the Treasury

of the United States, expended in establishing such homes as he

had previously recommended.  This fund was the foundation of the

Soldiers' Home at Washington City, and also one at Harrodsburgh,

Kentucky.



The latter went into disuse many years ago.  In fact it never

had many soldiers in it, and was, I believe, finally sold.





(*5) The Mexican war made three presidential candidates, Scott,

Taylor and Pierce--and any number of aspirants for that high

office.  It made also governors of States, members of the

cabinet, foreign ministers and other officers of high rank both

in state and nation.  The rebellion, which contained more war in

a single day, at some critical periods, than the whole Mexican

war in two years, has not been so fruitful of political results

to those engaged on the Union side.  On the other side, the side

of the South, nearly every man who holds office of any sort

whatever, either in the state or in the nation, was a

Confederate soldier, but this is easily accounted for from the

fact that the South was a military camp, and there were very few

people of a suitable age to be in the army who were not in it.

(*7) NOTE.--Since writing this chapter I have received from Mrs.

W. H. L. Wallace, widow of the gallant general who was killed in

the first day's fight on the field of Shiloh, a letter from

General Lew. Wallace to him dated the morning of the 5th.  At

the date of this letter it was well known that the Confederates

had troops out along the Mobile & Ohio railroad west of Crump's

landing and Pittsburg landing, and were also collecting near

Shiloh.  This letter shows that at that time General Lew.

Wallace was making preparations for the emergency that might

happen for the passing of reinforcements between Shiloh and his

position, extending from Crump's landing westward, and he sends

it over the road running from Adamsville to the Pittsburg

landing and Purdy road.  These two roads intersect nearly a mile

west of the crossing of the latter over Owl Creek, where our

right rested.  In this letter General Lew. Wallace advises

General W. H. L. Wallace that he will send "to-morrow" (and his

letter also says "April 5th," which is the same day the letter

was dated and which, therefore, must have been written on the

4th) some cavalry to report to him at his headquarters, and

suggesting the propriety of General W. H. L. Wallace's sending a

company back with them for the purpose of having the cavalry at

the two landings familiarize themselves with the road so that

they could "act promptly in case of emergency as guides to and

from the different camps."



This modifies very materially what I have said, and what has

been said by others, of the conduct of General Lew. Wallace at

the battle of Shiloh.  It shows that he naturally, with no more

experience than he had at the time in the profession of arms,

would take the particular road that he did start upon in the

absence of orders to move by a different road.



The mistake he made, and which probably caused his apparent

dilatoriness, was that of advancing some distance after he found

that the firing, which would be at first directly to his front

and then off to the left, had fallen back until it had got very

much in rear of the position of his advance.  This falling back

had taken place before I sent General Wallace orders to move up

to Pittsburg landing and, naturally, my order was to follow the

road nearest the river.  But my order was verbal, and to a staff

officer who was to deliver it to General Wallace, so that I am

not competent to say just what order the General actually

received.



General Wallace's division was stationed, the First brigade at

Crump's landing, the Second out two miles, and the Third two and

a half miles out.  Hearing the sounds of battle General Wallace

early ordered his First and Third brigades to concentrate on the

Second.  If the position of our front had not changed, the road

which Wallace took would have been somewhat shorter to our right

than the River road.

(*8) NOTE:  In an article on the battle of Shiloh which I wrote

for the Century Magazine, I stated that General A. McD. McCook,

who commanded a division of Buell's army, expressed some

unwillingness to pursue the enemy on Monday, April 7th, because

of the condition of his troops.  General Badeau, in his history,

also makes the same statement, on my authority.  Out of justice

to General McCook and his command, I must say that they left a

point twenty-two miles east of Savannah on the morning of the

6th.  From the heavy rains of a few days previous and the

passage of trains and artillery, the roads were necessarily deep

in mud, which made marching slow.  The division had not only

marched through this mud the day before, but it had been in the

rain all night without rest.  It was engaged in the battle of

the second day and did as good service as its position

allowed.  In fact an opportunity occurred for it to perform a

conspicuous act of gallantry which elicited the highest

commendation from division commanders in the Army of the

Tennessee.  General Sherman both in his memoirs and report makes

mention of this fact.  General McCook himself belongs to a family

which furnished many volunteers to the army.  I refer to these

circumstances with minuteness because I did General McCook

injustice in my article in the Century, though not to the extent

one would suppose from the public press.  I am not willing to do

any one an injustice, and if convinced that I have done one, I

am always willing to make the fullest admission.





(*9) NOTE.--For gallantry in the various engagements, from the

time I was left in command down to 26th of October and on my

recommendation, Generals McPherson and C. S. Hamilton were

promoted to be Major-Generals, and Colonels C. C. Marsh, 20th

Illinois, M. M. Crocker, 13th Iowa J. A. Mower, 11th Missouri,

M. D. Leggett, 78th Ohio, J. D. Stevenson, 7th Missouri, and

John E. Smith, 45th Illinois, to be Brigadiers.





(*10) Colonel Ellet reported having attacked a Confederate

battery on the Red River two days before with one of his boats,

the De Soto.  Running aground, he was obliged to abandon his

vessel.  However, he reported that he set fire to her and blew

her up.  Twenty of his men fell into the hands of the enemy.

With the balance he escaped on the small captured steamer, the

New Era, and succeeded in passing the batteries at Grand Gulf

and reaching the vicinity of Vicksburg.

(*12) NOTE.--On this occasion Governor Richard Yates, of

Illinois, happened to be on a visit to the army and accompanied

me to Carthage.  I furnished an ambulance for his use and that

of some of the State officers who accompanied him.





(*13) NOTE.--When General Sherman first learned of the move I

proposed to make, he called to see me about it.  I recollect

that I had transferred my headquarters from a boat in the river

to a house a short distance back from the levee.  I was seated

on the piazza engaged in conversation with my staff when Sherman

came up.  After a few moments' conversation he said that he would

like to see me alone.  We passed into the house together and shut

the door after us.  Sherman then expressed his alarm at the move

I had ordered, saying that I was putting myself in a position

voluntarily which an enemy would be glad to manoeuvre a year--or

a long time--to get me in.  I was going into the enemy's country,

with a large river behind me and the enemy holding points

strongly fortified above and below.  He said that it was an

axiom in war that when any great body of troops moved against an

enemy they should do so from a base of supplies, which they would

guard as they would the apple of the eye, etc.  He pointed out

all the difficulties that might be encountered in the campaign

proposed, and stated in turn what would be the true campaign to

make.  This was, in substance, to go back until high ground

could be reached on the east bank of the river; fortify there

and establish a depot of supplies, and move from there, being

always prepared to fall back upon it in case of disaster.  I

said this would take us back to Memphis.  Sherman then said that

was the very place he would go to, and would move by railroad

from Memphis to Grenada, repairing the road as we advanced.  To

this I replied, the country is already disheartened over the

lack of success on the part of our armies; the last election

went against the vigorous prosecution of the war, voluntary

enlistments had ceased throughout most of the North and

conscription was already resorted to, and if we went back so far

as Memphis it would discourage the people so much that bases of

supplies would be of no use:  neither men to hold them nor

supplies to put in them would be furnished.  The problem for us

was to move forward to a decisive victory, or our cause was

lost.  No progress was being made in any other field, and we had

to go on.



Sherman wrote to my adjutant general, Colonel J. A. Rawlins,

embodying his views of the campaign that should be made, and

asking him to advise me to at least get the views of my generals

upon the subject.  Colonel Rawlins showed me the letter, but I

did not see any reason for changing my plans.  The letter was

not answered and the subect was not subsequently mentioned

between Sherman and myself to the end of the war, that I

remember of.  I did not regard the letter as official, and

consequently did not preserve it.  General Sherman furnished a

copy himself to General Badeau, who printed it in his history of

my campaigns.  I did not regard either the conversation between

us or the letter to my adjutant-general as protests, but simply

friendly advice which the relations between us fully

justified.  Sherman gave the same energy to make the campaign a

success that he would or could have done if it had been ordered

by himself.  I make this statement here to correct an impression

which was circulated at the close of the war to Sherman's

prejudice, and for which there was no fair foundation.

Enclosed herewith I send you copy of instructions to

Major-General Thomas.  You having been over the ground in

person, and having heard the whole matter discussed, further

instructions will not be necessary for you.  It is particularly

desirable that a force should be got through to the railroad

between Cleveland and Dalton, and Longstreet thus cut off from

communication with the South, but being confronted by a large

force here, strongly located, it is not easy to tell how this is

to be effected until the result of our first effort is known.



I will add, however, what is not shown in my instructions to

Thomas, that a brigade of cavalry has been ordered here which,

if it arrives in time, will be thrown across the Tennessee above

Chickamauga, and may be able to make the trip to Cleveland or

thereabouts.

MAJOR-GENERAL GEO. H. THOMAS,

Chattanooga:



All preparations should be made for attacking the enemy's

position on Missionary Ridge by Saturday at daylight.  Not being

provided with a map giving names of roads, spurs of the

mountains, and other places, such definite instructions cannot

be given as might be desirable.  However, the general plan, you

understand, is for Sherman, with the force brought with him

strengthened by a division from your command, to effect a

crossing of the Tennessee River just below the mouth of

Chickamauga; his crossing to be protected by artillery from the

heights on the north bank of the river (to be located by your

chief of artillery), and to secure the heights on the northern

extremity to about the railroad tunnel before the enemy can

concentrate against him.  You will co-operate with Sherman.  The

troops in Chattanooga Valley should be well concentrated on your

left flank, leaving only the necessary force to defend

fortifications on the right and centre, and a movable column of

one division in readiness to move wherever ordered.  This

division should show itself as threateningly as possible on the

most practicable line for making an attack up the valley.  Your

effort then will be to form a junction with Sherman, making your

advance well towards the northern end of Missionary Ridge, and

moving as near simultaneously with him as possible.  The

junction once formed and the ridge carried, communications will

be at once established between the two armies by roads on the

south bank of the river.  Further movements will then depend on

those of the enemy.  Lookout Valley, I think, will be easily

held by Geary's division and what troops you may still have

there belonging to the old Army of the Cumberland.  Howard's

corps can then be held in readiness to act either with you at

Chattanooga or with Sherman.  It should be marched on Friday

night to a position on the north side of the river, not lower

down than the first pontoon-bridge, and there held in readiness

for such orders as may become necessary.  All these troops will

be provided with two days' cooked rations in haversacks, and one

hundred rounds of ammunition on the person of each infantry

soldier.  Special care should be taken by all officers to see

that ammunition is not wasted or unnecessarily fired away.  You

will call on the engineer department for such preparations as

you may deem necessary for carrying your infantry and artillery

over the creek.

General Sherman carried Missionary Ridge as far as the tunnel

and on top of the hill, his left at Chickamauga Creek.  I have

instructed General Sherman to advance as soon as it is light in

the morning, and your attack, which will be simultaneous, will

be in cooperation.  Your command will either carry the

rifle-pits and ridge directly in front of them, or move to the

left, as the presence of the enemy may require.  If Hooker's

position on the mountain [cannot be maintained] with a small

force, and it is found impracticable to carry the top from where

he is, it would be advisable for him to move up the valley with

all the force he can spare, and ascend by the first practicable

road.

MAJOR-GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN,

Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi.



GENERAL:--It is my design, if the enemy keep quiet and allow me

to take the initiative in the spring campaign, to work all parts

of the army together, and somewhat towards a common centre.  For

your information I now write you my programme, as at present

determined upon.



I have sent orders to Banks, by private messenger, to finish up

his present expedition against Shreveport with all dispatch; to

turn over the defence of Red River to General Steele and the

navy and to return your troops to you and his own to New

Orleans; to abandon all of Texas, except the Rio Grande, and to

hold that with not to exceed four thousand men; to reduce the

number of troops on the Mississippi to the lowest number

necessary to hold it, and to collect from his command not less

than twenty-five thousand men.  To this I will add five thousand

men from Missouri.  With this force he is to commence operations

against Mobile as soon as he can.  It will be impossible for him

to commence too early.



Gillmore joins Butler with ten thousand men, and the two operate

against Richmond from the south side of the James River.  This

will give Butler thirty-three thousand men to operate with, W.

F. Smith commanding the right wing of his forces and Gillmore

the left wing.  I will stay with the Army of the Potomac,

increased by Burnside's corps of not less than twenty-five

thousand effective men, and operate directly against Lee's army,

wherever it may be found.



Sigel collects all his available force in two columns, one,

under Ord and Averell, to start from Beverly, Virginia, and the

other, under Crook, to start from Charleston on the Kanawha, to

move against the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad.



Crook will have all cavalry, and will endeavor to get in about

Saltville, and move east from there to join Ord.  His force will

be all cavalry, while Ord will have from ten to twelve thousand

men of all arms.



You I propose to move against Johnston's army, to break it up

and to get into the interior of the enemy's country as far as

you can, inflicting all the damage you can against their war

resources.



I do not propose to lay down for you a plan of campaign, but

simply lay down the work it is desirable to have done and leave

you free to execute it in your own way.  Submit to me, however,

as early as you can, your plan of operations.



As stated, Banks is ordered to commence operations as soon as he

can.  Gillmore is ordered to report at Fortress Monroe by the

18th inst., or as soon thereafter as practicable.  Sigel is

concentrating now.  None will move from their places of

rendezvous until I direct, except Banks.  I want to be ready to

move by the 25th inst., if possible.  But all I can now direct

is that you get ready as soon as possible.  I know you will have

difficulties to encounter in getting through the mountains to

where supplies are abundant, but I believe you will accomplish

it.



From the expedition from the Department of West Virginia I do

not calculate on very great results; but it is the only way I

can take troops from there.  With the long line of railroad

Sigel has to protect, he can spare no troops except to move

directly to his front.  In this way he must get through to

inflict great damage on the enemy, or the enemy must detach from

one of his armies a large force to prevent it.  In other words,

if Sigel can't skin himself he can hold a leg while some one

else skins.



I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

MAJ.-GENERAL GEO. G. MEADE

Com'd'g Army of the Potomac.



For information and as instruction to govern your preparations

for the coming campaign, the following is communicated

confidentially for your own perusal alone.



So far as practicable all the armies are to move together, and

towards one common centre.  Banks has been instructed to turn

over the guarding of the Red River to General Steele and the

navy, to abandon Texas with the exception of the Rio Grande, and

to concentrate all the force he can, not less than 25,000 men, to

move on Mobile.  This he is to do without reference to other

movements.  From the scattered condition of his command,

however, he cannot possibly get it together to leave New Orleans

before the 1st of May, if so soon.  Sherman will move at the same

time you do, or two or three days in advance, Jo. Johnston's army

being his objective point, and the heart of Georgia his ultimate

aim.  If successful he will secure the line from Chattanooga to

Mobile with the aid of Banks.



Sigel cannot spare troops from his army to reinforce either of

the great armies, but he can aid them by moving directly to his

front.  This he has been directed to do, and is now making

preparations for it.  Two columns of his command will make south

at the same time with the general move; one from Beverly, from

ten to twelve thousand strong, under Major-General Ord; the

other from Charleston, Va., principally cavalry, under

Brig.-General Crook.  The former of these will endeavor to reach

the Tennessee and Virginia Railroad, about south of Covington,

and if found practicable will work eastward to Lynchburg and

return to its base by way of the Shenandoah Valley, or join

you.  The other will strike at Saltville, Va., and come eastward

to join Ord.  The cavalry from Ord's command will try tributaries

would furnish us an easy line over which to bring all supplies to

within easy hauling distance of every position the army could

occupy from the Rapidan to the James River.  But Lee could, if

he chose, detach or move his whole army north on a line rather

interior to the one I would have to take in following.  A

movement by his left--our right--would obviate this; but all

that was done would have to be done with the supplies and

ammunition we started with.  All idea of adopting this latter

plan was abandoned when the limited quantity of supplies

possible to take with us was considered.  The country over which

we would have to pass was so exhausted of all food or forage that

we would be obliged to carry everything with us.



While these preparations were going on the enemy was not

entirely idle.  In the West Forrest made a raid in West

Tennessee up to the northern border, capturing the garrison of

four or five hundred men at Union City, and followed it up by an

attack on Paducah, Kentucky, on the banks of the Ohio.  While he

was able to enter the city he failed to capture the forts or any

part of the garrison.  On the first intelligence of Forrest's

raid I telegraphed Sherman to send all his cavalry against him,

and not to let him get out of the trap he had put himself

into.  Sherman had anticipated me by sending troops against him

before he got my order.



Forrest, however, fell back rapidly, and attacked the troops at

Fort Pillow, a station for the protection of the navigation of

the Mississippi River.  The garrison to force a passage

southward, if they are successful in reaching the Virginia and

Tennessee Railroad, to cut the main lines of the road connecting

Richmond with all the South and South-west.



Gillmore will join Butler with about 10,000 men from South

Carolina. Butler can reduce his garrison so as to take 23,000

men into the field directly to his front.  The force will be

commanded by Maj.-General W. F. Smith.  With Smith and Gillmore,

Butler will seize City Point, and operate against Richmond from

the south side of the river.  His movement will be simultaneous

with yours.



Lee's army will be your objective point.  Wherever Lee goes,

there you will go also.  The only point upon which I am now in

doubt is, whether it will be better to cross the Rapidan above

or below him.  Each plan presents great advantages over the

other with corresponding objections.  By crossing above, Lee is

cut off from all chance of ignoring Richmond and going north on

a raid.  But if we take this route, all we do must be done

whilst the rations we start with hold out.  We separate from

Butler so that he cannot be directed how to co-operate.  By the

other route Brandy Station can be used as a base of supplies

until another is secured on the York or James rivers.



These advantages and objections I will talk over with you more

fully than I can write them.



Burnside with a force of probably 25,000 men will reinforce

you.  Immediately upon his arrival, which will be shortly after

the 20th inst., I will give him the defence of the road from

Bull Run as far south as we wish to hold it.  This will enable

you to collect all your strength about Brandy Station and to the

front.



There will be naval co-operation on the James River, and

transports and ferries will be provided so that should Lee fall

back into his intrenchments at Richmond, Butler's force and

yours will be a unit, or at least can be made to act as such.

What I would direct then, is that you commence at once reducing

baggage to the very lowest possible standard.  Two wagons to a

regiment of five hundred men is the greatest number that should

be allowed, for all baggage, exclusive of subsistence stores and

ordnance stores.  One wagon to brigade and one to division

headquarters is sufficient and about two to corps headquarters.



Should by Lee's right flank be our route, you will want to make

arrangements for having supplies of all sorts promptly forwarded

to White [louse on the Pamunkey.  Your estimates for this

contingency should be made at once.  If not wanted there, there

is every probability they will be wanted on the James River or

elsewhere.



If Lee's left is turned, large provision will have to be made

for ordnance stores.  I would say not much short of five hundred

rounds of infantry ammunition would do.  By the other, half the

amount would be sufficient.

the Army of the Tennessee during this battle, in his report gave

our total loss in killed, wounded and missing at 3,521; and

estimated that of the enemy to be not less than 10,000:  and

General G. M. Dodge, graphically describing to General Sherman

the enemy's attack, the full weight of which fell first upon and

was broken by his depleted command, remarks:  "The disparity of

forces can be seen from the fact that in the charge made by my

two brigades under Fuller and Mersy they took 351 prisoners,

representing forty-nine different regiments, eight brigades and

three divisions; and brought back eight battle flags from the

enemy."

recognition.  In making these recommendations I do not wish the

claims of General G. M. Dodge for promotion forgotten, but

recommend his name to be sent in at the same time.  I would also

ask to have General Wright assigned to the command of the Sixth

Humphreys to the rank of Major-General.



General Meade has more than met my most sanguine expectations.

He and Sherman are the fittest officers for large commands I

have come in contact with.  If their services can be rewarded by

promotion to the rank of Major-Generals in the regular army the

honor would be worthily bestowed, and I would feel personally

gratified.  I would not like to see one of these promotions at

this time without seeing both.

MAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK,

The relative position of the two armies is now as follows: Lee's

right rests on a swamp east of the Richmond and Fredericksburg

road and south of the North Anna, his centre on the river at Ox

Ford, and his left at Little River with the crossings of Little

River guarded as far up as we have gone. Hancock with his corps

and one division of the 9th corps crossed at Chesterfield Ford

and covers the right wing of Lee's army. One division of the 9th

corps is on the north bank of the Anna at Ox Ford, with bridges

above and below at points nearest to it where both banks are

held by us, so that it could reinforce either wing of our army

with equal facility.  The 5th and 6th corps with one division of

the 9th corps run from the south bank of the Anna from a short

distance above Ox Ford to Little River, and parallel with and

near to the enemy.



To make a direct attack from either wing would cause a slaughter

of our men that even success would not justify.  To turn the

enemy by his right, between the two Annas is impossible on

account of the swamp upon which his right rests.  To turn him by

the left leaves Little River, New Found River and South Anna

River, all of them streams presenting considerable obstacles to

the movement of our army, to be crossed.  I have determined

therefore to turn the enemy's right by crossing at or near

Hanover Town.  This crosses all three streams at once, and

leaves us still where we can draw supplies.



During the last night the teams and artillery not in position,

belonging to the right wing of our army, and one division of

that wing were quietly withdrawn to the north bank of the river

and moved down to the rear of the left.  As soon as it is dark

this division with most of the cavalry will commence a forced

march for Hanover Town to seize and hold the crossings.  The

balance of the right wing will withdraw at the same hour, and

follow as rapidly as possible.  The left wing will also withdraw

from the south bank of the river to-night and follow in rear of

the right wing.  Lee's army is really whipped.  The prisoners we

now take show it, and the action of his army shows it

unmistakably.  A battle with them outside of intrenchments

cannot be had.  Our men feel that they have gained the MORALE

over the enemy, and attack him with confidence.  I may be

mistaken, but I feel that our success over Lee's army is already

assured.  The promptness and rapidity with which you have

forwarded reinforcements has contributed largely to the feeling

of confidence inspired in our men, and to break down that of the

enemy.



We are destroying all the rails we can on the Central and

Fredericksburg roads.  I want to leave a gap on the roads north

of Richmond so big that to get a single track they will have to

import rail from elsewhere.  Even if a crossing is not effected

at Hanover Town it will probably be necessary for us to move on

down the Pamunkey until a crossing is effected.  I think it

advisable therefore to change our base of supplies from Port

Royal to the White House.  I wish you would direct this change

at once, and also direct Smith to put the railroad bridge there

in condition for crossing troops and artillery and leave men to

hold it.

MAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Chief of Staff of the Army, Washington,

D. C.



A full survey of all the ground satisfies me that it would be

impracticable to hold a line north-east of Richmond that would

protect the Fredericksburg Railroad to enable us to use that

road for supplying the army.  To do so would give us a long

vulnerable line of road to protect, exhausting much of our

strength to guard it, and would leave open to the enemy all of

his lines of communication on the south side of the James.  My

idea from the start has been to beat Lee's army if possible

north of Richmond; then after destroying his lines of

communication on the north side of the James River to transfer

the army to the south side and besiege Lee in Richmond, or

follow him south if he should retreat.



I now find, after over thirty days of trial, the enemy deems it

of the first importance to run no risks with the armies they now

have.  They act purely on the defensive behind breastworks, or

feebly on the offensive immediately in front of them, and where

in case of repulse they can instantly retire behind them.

Without a greater sacrifice of human life than I am willing to

make all cannot be accomplished that I had designed outside of

the city.  I have therefore resolved upon the following plan:



I will continue to hold substantially the ground now occupied by

the Army of the Potomac, taking advantage of any favorable

circumstance that may present itself until the cavalry can be

sent west to destroy the Virginia Central Railroad from about

Beaver Dam for some twenty-five or thirty miles west.  When this

is effected I will move the army to the south side of the James

River, either by crossing the Chickahominy and marching near to

City Point, or by going to the mouth of the Chickahominy on

north side and crossing there.  To provide for this last and

most possible contingency, several ferry-boats of the largest

class ought to be immediately provided.



Once on the south side of the James River, I can cut off all

sources of supply to the enemy except what is furnished by the

canal.  If Hunter succeeds in reaching Lynchburg, that will be

lost to him also.  Should Hunter not succeed, I will still make

the effort to destroy the canal by sending cavalry up the south

side of the river with a pontoon train to cross wherever they

can.



The feeling of the two armies now seems to be that the rebels

can protect themselves only by strong intrenchments, whilst our

army is not only confident of protecting itself without

intrenchments, but that it can beat and drive the enemy wherever

and whenever he can be found without this protection.

General Sheridan leaves here to-morrow morning, with

instructions to proceed to Charlottesville, Va., and to commence

there the destruction of the Va. Cen. R. R., destroying this way

as much as possible.  The complete destruction of this road and

of the canal on James River is of great importance to us.

According to the instructions I sent to General Halleck for your

guidance, you were to proceed to Lynchburg and commence there. It

would be of great value to us to get possession of Lynchburg for

a single day.  But that point is of so much importance to the

enemy, that in attempting to get it such resistance may be met

as to defeat your getting onto the road or canal at all.  I see,

in looking over the letter to General Halleck on the subject of

your instructions, that it rather indicates that your route

should be from Staunton via Charlottesville.  If you have so

understood it, you will be doing just what I want.  The

direction I would now give is, that if this letter reaches you

in the valley between Staunton and Lynchburg, you immediately

turn east by the most practicable road.  From thence move

eastward along the line of the road, destroying it completely

and thoroughly, until you join General Sheridan.  After the work

laid out for General Sheridan and yourself is thoroughly done,

proceed to join the Army of the Potomac by the route laid out in

General Sheridan's instructions.



If any portion of your force, especially your cavalry, is needed

back in your Department, you are authorized to send it back.



If on receipt of this you should be near to Lynchburg and deem

it practicable to detach a cavalry force to destroy the canal.

Lose no opportunity to destroy the canal.

The enemy in their endeavor to reinforce Petersburg abandoned

their intrenchments in front of Bermuda Hundred.  They no doubt

expected troops from north of the James River to take their

place before we discovered it.  General Butler took advantage of

this and moved a force at once upon the railroad and plank road

between Richmond and Petersburg, which I hope to retain

possession of.



Too much credit cannot be given to the troops and their

The engineer officers who made a survey of the front from

Bermuda Hundred report against the probability of success from

an attack there.  The chances they think will be better on

Burnside's front.  If this is attempted it will be necessary to

concentrate all the force possible at the point in the enemy's

line we expect to penetrate.  All officers should be fully

impressed with the absolute necessity of pushing entirely beyond

the enemy's present line, if they should succeed in penetrating

it, and of getting back to their present line promptly if they

should not succeed in breaking through.



To the right and left of the point of assault all the artillery

possible should be brought to play upon the enemy in front

during the assault.  Their lines would be sufficient for the

support of the artillery, and all the reserves could be brought

on the flanks of their commands nearest to the point of assault,

ready to follow in if successful.  The field artillery and

infantry held in the lines during the first assault should be in

readiness to move at a moment's notice either to their front or

to follow the main assault, as they should receive orders.  One

thing, however, should be impressed on corps commanders.  If

they see the enemy giving away on their front or moving from it

to reinforce a heavily assaulted portion of their line, they

should take advantage of such knowledge and act promptly without

waiting for orders from army commanders.  General Ord can

co-operate with his corps in this movement, and about five

thousand troops from Bermuda Hundred can be sent to reinforce

you or can be used to threaten an assault between the Appomattox

and James rivers, as may be deemed best.



This should be done by Tuesday morning, if done at all.  If not

attempted, we will then start at the date indicated to destroy

the railroad as far as Hicksford at least, and to Weldon if

possible.

best method of dealing with the enemy.  You will now suffer

in rear of the enemy.  Now is one of the finest opportunities
