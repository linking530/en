THE CAPTURE OF PETERSBURG--MEETING PRESIDENT LINCOLN IN

PETERSBURG--THE CAPTURE OF RICHMOND--PURSUING THE ENEMY-- VISIT

TO SHERIDAN AND MEADE.



General Meade and I entered Petersburg on the morning of the 3d

and took a position under cover of a house which protected us

from the enemies musketry which was flying thick and fast

there.  As we would occasionally look around the corner we could

see the streets and the Appomattox bottom, presumably near the

bridge, packed with the Confederate army.  I did not have

artillery brought up, because I was sure Lee was trying to make

his escape, and I wanted to push immediately in pursuit.  At all

events I had not the heart to turn the artillery upon such a mass

of defeated and fleeing men, and I hoped to capture them soon.



Soon after the enemy had entirely evacuated Petersburg, a man

came in who represented himself to be an engineer of the Army of

Northern Virginia.  He said that Lee had for some time been at

work preparing a strong enclosed intrenchment, into which he

would throw himself when forced out of Petersburg, and fight his

final battle there; that he was actually at that time drawing his

troops from Richmond, and falling back into this prepared work.

This statement was made to General Meade and myself when we were

together.  I had already given orders for the movement up the

south side of the Appomattox for the purpose of heading off Lee;

but Meade was so much impressed by this man's story that he

thought we ought to cross the Appomattox there at once and move

against Lee in his new position.  I knew that Lee was no fool,

as he would have been to have put himself and his army between

two formidable streams like the James and Appomattox rivers, and

between two such armies as those of the Potomac and the James.

Then these streams coming together as they did to the east of

him, it would be only necessary to close up in the west to have

him thoroughly cut off from all supplies or possibility of

reinforcement.  It would only have been a question of days, and

not many of them, if he had taken the position assigned to him

by the so-called engineer, when he would have been obliged to

surrender his army.  Such is one of the ruses resorted to in war

to deceive your antagonist.  My judgment was that Lee would

necessarily have to evacuate Richmond, and that the only course

for him to pursue would be to follow the Danville Road.

Accordingly my object was to secure a point on that road south

of Lee, and I told Meade this.  He suggested that if Lee was

going that way we would follow him.  My reply was that we did

not want to follow him; we wanted to get ahead of him and cut

him off, and if he would only stay in the position he (Meade)

believed him to be in at that time, I wanted nothing better;

that when we got in possession of the Danville Railroad, at its

crossing of the Appomattox River, if we still found him between

the two rivers, all we had to do was to move eastward and close

him up.  That we would then have all the advantage we could

possibly have by moving directly against him from Petersburg,

even if he remained in the position assigned him by the engineer

officer.



I had held most of the command aloof from the intrenchments, so

as to start them out on the Danville Road early in the morning,

supposing that Lee would be gone during the night.  During the

night I strengthened Sheridan by sending him Humphreys's corps.



Lee, as we now know, had advised the authorities at Richmond,

during the day, of the condition of affairs, and told them it

would be impossible for him to hold out longer than night, if he

could hold out that long.  Davis was at church when he received

Lee's dispatch.  The congregation was dismissed with the notice

that there would be no evening service.  The rebel government

left Richmond about two o'clock in the afternoon of the 2d.



At night Lee ordered his troops to assemble at Amelia Court

House, his object being to get away, join Johnston if possible,

and to try to crush Sherman before I could get there.  As soon

as I was sure of this I notified Sheridan and directed him to

move out on the Danville Railroad to the south side of the

Appomattox River as speedily as possible.  He replied that he

already had some of his command nine miles out.  I then ordered

the rest of the Army of the Potomac under Meade to follow the

same road in the morning.  Parke's corps followed by the same

road, and the Army of the James was directed to follow the road

which ran alongside of the South Side Railroad to Burke's

Station, and to repair the railroad and telegraph as they

proceeded.  That road was a 5 feet gauge, while our rolling

stock was all of the 4 feet 8 1/2 inches gauge; consequently the

rail on one side of the track had to be taken up throughout the

whole length and relaid so as to conform to the gauge of our

cars and locomotives.



Mr. Lincoln was at City Point at the time, and had been for some

days.  I would have let him know what I contemplated doing, only

while I felt a strong conviction that the move was going to be

successful, yet it might not prove so; and then I would have

only added another to the many disappointments he had been

suffering for the past three years.  But when we started out he

saw that we were moving for a purpose, and bidding us Godspeed,

remained there to hear the result.



The next morning after the capture of Petersburg, I telegraphed

Mr. Lincoln asking him to ride out there and see me, while I

would await his arrival.  I had started all the troops out early

in the morning, so that after the National army left Petersburg

there was not a soul to be seen, not even an animal in the

streets.  There was absolutely no one there, except my staff

officers and, possibly, a small escort of cavalry.  We had

selected the piazza of a deserted house, and occupied it until

the President arrived.



About the first thing that Mr. Lincoln said to me, after warm

congratulations for the victory, and thanks both to myself and

to the army which had accomplished it, was:  "Do you know,

general, that I have had a sort of a sneaking idea for some days

that you intended to do something like this."  Our movements

having been successful up to this point, I no longer had any

object in concealing from the President all my movements, and

the objects I had in view.  He remained for some days near City

Point, and I communicated with him frequently and fully by

telegraph.



Mr. Lincoln knew that it had been arranged for Sherman to join

me at a fixed time, to co-operate in the destruction of Lee's

army.  I told him that I had been very anxious to have the

Eastern armies vanquish their old enemy who had so long resisted

all their repeated and gallant attempts to subdue them or drive

them from their capital.  The Western armies had been in the

main successful until they had conquered all the territory from

the Mississippi River to the State of North Carolina, and were

now almost ready to knock at the back door of Richmond, asking

admittance.  I said to him that if the Western armies should be

even upon the field, operating against Richmond and Lee, the

credit would be given to them for the capture, by politicians

and non-combatants from the section of country which those

troops hailed from.  It might lead to disagreeable bickerings

between members of Congress of the East and those of the West in

some of their debates.  Western members might be throwing it up

to the members of the East that in the suppression of the

rebellion they were not able to capture an army, or to

accomplish much in the way of contributing toward that end, but

had to wait until the Western armies had conquered all the

territory south and west of them, and then come on to help them

capture the only army they had been engaged with.



Mr. Lincoln said he saw that now, but had never thought of it

before, because his anxiety was so great that he did not care

where the aid came from so the work was done.



The Army of the Potomac has every reason to be proud of its four

years' record in the suppression of the rebellion.  The army it

had to fight was the protection to the capital of a people which

was attempting to found a nation upon the territory of the United

States.  Its loss would be the loss of the cause.  Every energy,

therefore, was put forth by the Confederacy to protect and

maintain their capital.  Everything else would go if it went.

Lee's army had to be strengthened to enable it to maintain its

position, no matter what territory was wrested from the South in

another quarter.



I never expected any such bickering as I have indicated, between

the soldiers of the two sections; and, fortunately, there has

been none between the politicians.  Possibly I am the only one

who thought of the liability of such a state of things in

advance.



When our conversation was at an end Mr. Lincoln mounted his

horse and started on his return to City Point, while I and my

staff started to join the army, now a good many miles in

advance.  Up to this time I had not received the report of the

capture of Richmond.



Soon after I left President Lincoln I received a dispatch from

General Weitzel which notified me that he had taken possession

of Richmond at about 8.15 o'clock in the morning of that day,

the 3d, and that he had found the city on fire in two places.

The city was in the most utter confusion.  The authorities had

taken the precaution to empty all the liquor into the gutter,

and to throw out the provisions which the Confederate government

had left, for the people to gather up.  The city had been

deserted by the authorities, civil and military, without any

notice whatever that they were about to leave.  In fact, up to

the very hour of the evacuation the people had been led to

believe that Lee had gained an important victory somewhere

around Petersburg.



Weitzel's command found evidence of great demoralization in

Lee's army, there being still a great many men and even officers

in the town.  The city was on fire.  Our troops were directed to

extinguish the flames, which they finally succeeded in doing.

The fire had been started by some one connected with the

retreating army.  All authorities deny that it was authorized,

and I presume it was the work of excited men who were leaving

what they regarded as their capital and may have felt that it

was better to destroy it than have it fall into the hands of

their enemy.  Be that as it may, the National troops found the

city in flames, and used every effort to extinguish them.



The troops that had formed Lee's right, a great many of them,

were cut off from getting back into Petersburg, and were pursued

by our cavalry so hotly and closely that they threw away

caissons, ammunition, clothing, and almost everything to lighten

their loads, and pushed along up the Appomattox River until

finally they took water and crossed over.



I left Mr. Lincoln and started, as I have already said, to join

the command, which halted at Sutherland Station, about nine

miles out.  We had still time to march as much farther, and time

was an object; but the roads were bad and the trains belonging to

the advance corps had blocked up the road so that it was

impossible to get on.  Then, again, our cavalry had struck some

of the enemy and were pursuing them; and the orders were that

the roads should be given up to the cavalry whenever they

appeared.  This caused further delay.



General Wright, who was in command of one of the corps which

were left back, thought to gain time by letting his men go into

bivouac and trying to get up some rations for them, and clearing

out the road, so that when they did start they would be

uninterrupted.  Humphreys, who was far ahead, was also out of

rations.  They did not succeed in getting them up through the

night; but the Army of the Potomac, officers and men, were so

elated by the reflection that at last they were following up a

victory to its end, that they preferred marching without rations

to running a possible risk of letting the enemy elude them.  So

the march was resumed at three o'clock in the morning.



Merritt's cavalry had struck the enemy at Deep Creek, and driven

them north to the Appomattox, where, I presume, most of them were

forced to cross.



On the morning of the 4th I learned that Lee had ordered rations

up from Danville for his famishing army, and that they were to

meet him at Farmville.  This showed that Lee had already

abandoned the idea of following the railroad down to Danville,

but had determined to go farther west, by the way of

Farmville.  I notified Sheridan of this and directed him to get

possession of the road before the supplies could reach Lee.  He

responded that he had already sent Crook's division to get upon

the road between Burkesville and Jetersville, then to face north

and march along the road upon the latter place; and he thought

Crook must be there now.  The bulk of the army moved directly

for Jetersville by two roads.



After I had received the dispatch from Sheridan saying that

Crook was on the Danville Road, I immediately ordered Meade to

make a forced march with the Army of the Potomac, and to send

Parke's corps across from the road they were on to the South

Side Railroad, to fall in the rear of the Army of the James and

to protect the railroad which that army was repairing as it went

along.



Our troops took possession of Jetersville and in the telegraph

office, they found a dispatch from Lee, ordering two hundred

thousand rations from Danville.  The dispatch had not been sent,

but Sheridan sent a special messenger with it to Burkesville and

had it forwarded from there.  In the meantime, however,

dispatches from other sources had reached Danville, and they

knew there that our army was on the line of the road; so that

they sent no further supplies from that quarter.



At this time Merritt and Mackenzie, with the cavalry, were off

between the road which the Army of the Potomac was marching on

and the Appomattox River, and were attacking the enemy in

flank.  They picked up a great many prisoners and forced the

abandonment of some property.



Lee intrenched himself at Amelia Court House, and also his

advance north of Jetersville, and sent his troops out to collect

forage.  The country was very poor and afforded but very

little.  His foragers scattered a great deal; many of them were

picked up by our men, and many others never returned to the Army

of Northern Virginia.



Griffin's corps was intrenched across the railroad south of

Jetersville, and Sheridan notified me of the situation.  I again

ordered Meade up with all dispatch, Sheridan having but the one

corps of infantry with a little cavalry confronting Lee's entire

army.  Meade, always prompt in obeying orders, now pushed forward

with great energy, although he was himself sick and hardly able

to be out of bed.  Humphreys moved at two, and Wright at three

o'clock in the morning, without rations, as I have said, the

wagons being far in the rear.



I stayed that night at Wilson's Station on the South Side

Railroad.  On the morning of the 5th I sent word to Sheridan of

the progress Meade was making, and suggested that he might now

attack Lee.  We had now no other objective than the Confederate

armies, and I was anxious to close the thing up at once.



On the 5th I marched again with Ord's command until within about

ten miles of Burkesville, where I stopped to let his army pass. I

then received from Sheridan the following dispatch:



"The whole of Lee's army is at or near Amelia Court House, and

on this side of it.  General Davies, whom I sent out to

Painesville on their right flank, has just captured six pieces

of artillery and some wagons.  We can capture the Army of

Northern Virginia if force enough can be thrown to this point,

and then advance upon it.  My cavalry was at Burkesville

yesterday, and six miles beyond, on the Danville Road, last

night.  General Lee is at Amelia Court House in person.  They

are out of rations, or nearly so.  They were advancing up the

railroad towards Burkesville yesterday, when we intercepted them

at this point."



It now became a life and death struggle with Lee to get south to

his provisions.



Sheridan, thinking the enemy might turn off immediately towards

Farmville, moved Davies's brigade of cavalry out to watch him.

Davies found the movement had already commenced.  He attacked

and drove away their cavalry which was escorting wagons to the

west, capturing and burning 180 wagons.  He also captured five

pieces of artillery.  The Confederate infantry then moved

against him and probably would have handled him very roughly,

but Sheridan had sent two more brigades of cavalry to follow

Davies, and they came to his relief in time.  A sharp engagement

took place between these three brigades of cavalry and the

enemy's infantry, but the latter was repulsed.



Meade himself reached Jetersville about two o'clock in the

afternoon, but in advance of all his troops.  The head of

Humphreys's corps followed in about an hour afterwards. Sheridan

stationed the troops as they came up, at Meade's request, the

latter still being very sick.  He extended two divisions of this

corps off to the west of the road to the left of Griffin's corps,

and one division to the right.  The cavalry by this time had also

come up, and they were put still farther off to the left,

Sheridan feeling certain that there lay the route by which the

enemy intended to escape.  He wanted to attack, feeling that if

time was given, the enemy would get away; but Meade prevented

this, preferring to wait till his troops were all up.



At this juncture Sheridan sent me a letter which had been handed

to him by a colored man, with a note from himself saying that he

wished I was there myself.  The letter was dated Amelia Court

House, April 5th, and signed by Colonel Taylor.  It was to his

mother, and showed the demoralization of the Confederate army.

Sheridan's note also gave me the information as here related of

the movements of that day.  I received a second message from

Sheridan on the 5th, in which he urged more emphatically the

importance of my presence.  This was brought to me by a scout in

gray uniform.  It was written on tissue paper, and wrapped up in

tin-foil such as chewing tobacco is folded in.  This was a

precaution taken so that if the scout should be captured he

could take this tin-foil out of his pocket and putting it into

his mouth, chew it.  It would cause no surprise at all to see a

Confederate soldier chewing tobacco.  It was nearly night when

this letter was received.  I gave Ord directions to continue his

march to Burkesville and there intrench himself for the night,

and in the morning to move west to cut off all the roads between

there and Farmville.



I then started with a few of my staff and a very small escort of

cavalry, going directly through the woods, to join Meade's

army.  The distance was about sixteen miles; but the night being

dark our progress was slow through the woods in the absence of

direct roads.  However, we got to the outposts about ten o'clock

in the evening, and after some little parley convinced the

sentinels of our identity and were conducted in to where

Sheridan was bivouacked.  We talked over the situation for some

little time, Sheridan explaining to me what he thought Lee was

trying to do, and that Meade's orders, if carried out, moving to

the right flank, would give him the coveted opportunity of

escaping us and putting us in rear of him.



We then together visited Meade, reaching his headquarters about

midnight.  I explained to Meade that we did not want to follow

the enemy; we wanted to get ahead of him, and that his orders

would allow the enemy to escape, and besides that, I had no

doubt that Lee was moving right then.  Meade changed his orders

at once.  They were now given for an advance on Amelia Court

House, at an early hour in the morning, as the army then lay;

that is, the infantry being across the railroad, most of it to

the west of the road, with the cavalry swung out still farther

to the left.
