AFTER THE BATTLE--TELEGRAPH AND SIGNAL SERVICE--MOVEMENT BY THE

LEFT FLANK.



More desperate fighting has not been witnessed on this continent

than that of the 5th and 6th of May.  Our victory consisted in

having successfully crossed a formidable stream, almost in the

face of an enemy, and in getting the army together as a unit. 

We gained an advantage on the morning of the 6th, which, if it

had been followed up, must have proven very decisive.  In the

evening the enemy gained an advantage; but was speedily

repulsed.  As we stood at the close, the two armies were

relatively in about the same condition to meet each other as

when the river divided them.  But the fact of having safely

crossed was a victory.



Our losses in the Wilderness were very severe.  Those of the

Confederates must have been even more so; but I have no means of

speaking with accuracy upon this point.  The Germania Ford bridge

was transferred to Ely's Ford to facilitate the transportation of

the wounded to Washington.



It may be as well here as elsewhere to state two things

connected with all movements of the Army of the Potomac:  first,

in every change of position or halt for the night, whether

confronting the enemy or not, the moment arms were stacked the

men intrenched themselves.  For this purpose they would build up

piles of logs or rails if they could be found in their front, and

dig a ditch, throwing the dirt forward on the timber.  Thus the

digging they did counted in making a depression to stand in, and

increased the elevation in front of them.  It was wonderful how

quickly they could in this way construct defences of

considerable strength.  When a halt was made with the view of

assaulting the enemy, or in his presence, these would be

strengthened or their positions changed under the direction of

engineer officers.  The second was, the use made of the

telegraph and signal corps.  Nothing could be more complete than

the organization and discipline of this body of brave and

intelligent men.  Insulated wires--insulated so that they would

transmit messages in a storm, on the ground or under water--were

wound upon reels, making about two hundred pounds weight of wire

to each reel.  Two men and one mule were detailed to each

reel.  The pack-saddle on which this was carried was provided

with a rack like a sawbuck placed crosswise of the saddle, and

raised above it so that the reel, with its wire, would revolve

freely.  There was a wagon, supplied with a telegraph operator,

battery and telegraph instruments for each division, each corps,

each army, and one for my headquarters.  There were wagons also

loaded with light poles, about the size and length of a wall

tent pole, supplied with an iron spike in one end, used to hold

the wires up when laid, so that wagons and artillery would not

run over them.  The mules thus loaded were assigned to brigades,

and always kept with the command they were assigned to.  The

operators were also assigned to particular headquarters, and

never changed except by special orders.



The moment the troops were put in position to go into camp all

the men connected with this branch of service would proceed to

put up their wires.  A mule loaded with a coil of wire would be

led to the rear of the nearest flank of the brigade he belonged

to, and would be led in a line parallel thereto, while one man

would hold an end of the wire and uncoil it as the mule was led

off.  When he had walked the length of the wire the whole of it

would be on the ground.  This would be done in rear of every

brigade at the same time.  The ends of all the wires would then

be joined, making a continuous wire in the rear of the whole

army.  The men, attached to brigades or divisions, would all

commence at once raising the wires with their telegraph poles.

This was done by making a loop in the wire and putting it over

the spike and raising the pole to a perpendicular position.  At

intervals the wire would be attached to trees, or some other

permanent object, so that one pole was sufficient at a place. In

the absence of such a support two poles would have to be used, at

intervals, placed at an angle so as to hold the wire firm in its

place.  While this was being done the telegraph wagons would

take their positions near where the headquarters they belonged

to were to be established, and would connect with the wire. 

Thus, in a few minutes longer time than it took a mule to walk

the length of its coil, telegraphic communication would be

effected between all the headquarters of the army.  No orders

ever had to be given to establish the telegraph.



The signal service was used on the march.  The men composing

this corps were assigned to specified commands.  When movements

were made, they would go in advance, or on the flanks, and seize

upon high points of ground giving a commanding view of the

country, if cleared, or would climb tall trees on the highest

points if not cleared, and would denote, by signals, the

positions of different parts of our own army, and often the

movements of the enemy.  They would also take off the signals of

the enemy and transmit them.  It would sometimes take too long a

time to make translations of intercepted dispatches for us to

receive any benefit from them.  But sometimes they gave useful

information.



On the afternoon of the 7th I received news from Washington

announcing that Sherman had probably attacked Johnston that day,

and that Butler had reached City Point safely and taken it by

surprise on the 5th.  I had given orders for a movement by the

left flank, fearing that Lee might move rapidly to Richmond to

crush Butler before I could get there.



My order for this movement was as follows:





HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE U. S.,

May 7, 1864, 6.30 A.M.



MAJOR-GENERAL MEADE,

Commanding A. P.



Make all preparations during the day for a night march to take

position at Spottsylvania C. H. with one army corps, at Todd's

Tavern with one, and another near the intersection of the Piney

Branch and Spottsylvania road with the road from Alsop's to Old

Court House.  If this move is made the trains should be thrown

forward early in the morning to the Ny River.



I think it would be advisable in making the change to leave

Hancock where he is until Warren passes him.  He could then

follow and become the right of the new line.  Burnside will move

to Piney Branch Church.  Sedgwick can move along the pike to

Chancellorsville and on to his destination.  Burnside will move

on the plank road to the intersection of it with the Orange and

Fredericksburg plank road, then follow Sedgwick to his place of

destination.



All vehicles should be got out of hearing of the enemy before

the troops move, and then move off quietly.



It is more than probable that the enemy concentrate for a heavy

attack on Hancock this afternoon.  In case they do we must be

prepared to resist them, and follow up any success we may gain,

with our whole force.  Such a result would necessarily modify

these instructions.



All the hospitals should be moved to-day to Chancellorsville.



U. S. GRANT,

Lieut.-General.





During the 7th Sheridan had a fight with the rebel cavalry at

Todd's Tavern, but routed them, thus opening the way for the

troops that were to go by that route at night.  Soon after dark

Warren withdrew from the front of the enemy, and was soon

followed by Sedgwick.  Warren's march carried him immediately

behind the works where Hancock's command lay on the Brock

Road.  With my staff and a small escort of cavalry I preceded

the troops.  Meade with his staff accompanied me.  The greatest

enthusiasm was manifested by Hancock's men as we passed by.  No

doubt it was inspired by the fact that the movement was south.

It indicated to them that they had passed through the "beginning

of the end" in the battle just fought.  The cheering was so lusty

that the enemy must have taken it for a night attack.  At all

events it drew from him a furious fusillade of artillery and

musketry, plainly heard but not felt by us.



Meade and I rode in advance.  We had passed but a little way

beyond our left when the road forked.  We looked to see, if we

could, which road Sheridan had taken with his cavalry during the

day.  It seemed to be the right-hand one, and accordingly we took

it.  We had not gone far, however, when Colonel C. B. Comstock,

of my staff, with the instinct of the engineer, suspecting that

we were on a road that would lead us into the lines of the

enemy, if he, too, should be moving, dashed by at a rapid gallop

and all alone.  In a few minutes he returned and reported that

Lee was moving, and that the road we were on would bring us into

his lines in a short distance.  We returned to the forks of the

road, left a man to indicate the right road to the head of

Warren's column when it should come up, and continued our

journey to Todd's Tavern, where we arrived after midnight.



My object in moving to Spottsylvania was two-fold:  first, I did

not want Lee to get back to Richmond in time to attempt to crush

Butler before I could get there; second, I wanted to get between

his army and Richmond if possible; and, if not, to draw him into

the open field.  But Lee, by accident, beat us to

Spottsylvania.  Our wagon trains had been ordered easterly of

the roads the troops were to march upon before the movement

commenced.  Lee interpreted this as a semi-retreat of the Army

of the Potomac to Fredericksburg, and so informed his

government.  Accordingly he ordered Longstreet's corps--now

commanded by Anderson--to move in the morning (the 8th) to

Spottsylvania.  But the woods being still on fire, Anderson

could not go into bivouac, and marched directly on to his

destination that night.  By this accident Lee got possession of

Spottsylvania.  It is impossible to say now what would have been

the result if Lee's orders had been obeyed as given; but it is

certain that we would have been in Spottsylvania, and between

him and his capital.  My belief is that there would have been a

race between the two armies to see which could reach Richmond

first, and the Army of the Potomac would have had the shorter

line.  Thus, twice since crossing the Rapidan we came near

closing the campaign, so far as battles were concerned, from the

Rapidan to the James River or Richmond.  The first failure was

caused by our not following up the success gained over Hill's

corps on the morning of the 6th, as before described:  the

second, when fires caused by that battle drove Anderson to make

a march during the night of the 7th-8th which he was ordered to

commence on the morning of the 8th.  But accident often decides

the fate of battle.



Sheridan's cavalry had had considerable fighting during the

afternoon of the 7th, lasting at Todd's Tavern until after

night, with the field his at the close.  He issued the necessary

orders for seizing Spottsylvania and holding the bridge over the

Po River, which Lee's troops would have to cross to get to

Spottsylvania.  But Meade changed Sheridan's orders to

Merritt--who was holding the bridge--on his arrival at Todd's

Tavern, and thereby left the road free for Anderson when he came

up.  Wilson, who was ordered to seize the town, did so, with his

division of cavalry; but he could not hold it against the

Confederate corps which had not been detained at the crossing of

the Po, as it would have been but for the unfortunate change in

Merritt's orders.  Had he been permitted to execute the orders

Sheridan gave him, he would have been guarding with two brigades

of cavalry the bridge over the Po River which Anderson had to

cross, and must have detained him long enough to enable Warren

to reinforce Wilson and hold the town.



Anderson soon intrenched himself--if indeed the intrenchments

were not already made--immediately across Warren's front. Warren

was not aware of his presence, but probably supposed it was the

cavalry which Merritt had engaged earlier in the day. He

assaulted at once, but was repulsed.  He soon organized his men,

as they were not pursued by the enemy, and made a second attack,

this time with his whole corps.  This time he succeeded in

gaining a position immediately in the enemy's front, where he

intrenched.  His right and left divisions--the former

Crawford's, the latter Wadsworth's, now commanded by

Cutler--drove the enemy back some distance.



At this time my headquarters had been advanced to Piney Branch

Church.  I was anxious to crush Anderson before Lee could get a

force to his support.  To this end Sedgwick who was at Piney

Branch Church, was ordered to Warren's support.  Hancock, who

was at Todd's Tavern, was notified of Warren's engagement, and

was directed to be in readiness to come up.  Burnside, who was

with the wagon trains at Aldrich's on our extreme left, received

the same instructions.  Sedgwick was slow in getting up for some

reason--probably unavoidable, because he was never at fault when

serious work was to be done--so that it was near night before the

combined forces were ready to attack.  Even then all of

Sedgwick's command did not get into the engagement.  Warren led

the last assault, one division at a time, and of course it

failed.



Warren's difficulty was twofold:  when he received an order to

do anything, it would at once occur to his mind how all the

balance of the army should be engaged so as properly to

co-operate with him.  His ideas were generally good, but he

would forget that the person giving him orders had thought of

others at the time he had of him.  In like manner, when he did

get ready to execute an order, after giving most intelligent

instructions to division commanders, he would go in with one

division, holding the others in reserve until he could

superintend their movements in person also, forgetting that

division commanders could execute an order without his

presence.  His difficulty was constitutional and beyond his

control.  He was an officer of superior ability, quick

perceptions, and personal courage to accomplish anything that

could be done with a small command.



Lee had ordered Hill's corps--now commanded by Early--to move by

the very road we had marched upon.  This shows that even early in

the morning of the 8th Lee had not yet become acquainted with my

move, but still thought that the Army of the Potomac had gone to

Fredericksburg.  Indeed, he informed the authorities at Richmond

he had possession of Spottsylvania and was on my flank. Anderson

was in possession of Spottsylvania, through no foresight of Lee,

however.  Early only found that he had been following us when he

ran against Hancock at Todd's Tavern.  His coming detained

Hancock from the battle-field of Spottsylvania for that day; but

he, in like manner, kept Early back and forced him to move by

another route.



Had I ordered the movement for the night of the 7th by my left

flank, it would have put Hancock in the lead.  It would also

have given us an hour or earlier start.  It took all that time

for Warren to get the head of his column to the left of Hancock

after he had got his troops out of their line confronting the

enemy.  This hour, and Hancock's capacity to use his whole force

when necessary, would, no doubt, have enabled him to crush

Anderson before he could be reinforced.  But the movement made

was tactical.  It kept the troops in mass against a possible

assault by the enemy.  Our left occupied its intrenchments while

the two corps to the right passed.  If an attack had been made by

the enemy he would have found the 2d corps in position,

fortified, and, practically, the 5th and 6th corps in position

as reserves, until his entire front was passed.  By a left flank

movement the army would have been scattered while still passing

the front of the enemy, and before the extreme right had got by

it would have been very much exposed.  Then, too, I had not yet

learned the special qualifications of the different corps

commanders.  At that time my judgment was that Warren was the

man I would suggest to succeed Meade should anything happen to

that gallant soldier to take him from the field.  As I have

before said, Warren was a gallant soldier, an able man; and he

was beside thoroughly imbued with the solemnity and importance

of the duty he had to perform.
