INTERVIEW WITH SHERIDAN--GRAND MOVEMENT OF THE ARMY OF THE

POTOMAC--SHERIDAN'S ADVANCE ON FIVE FORKS--BATTLE OF FIVE

FORKS--PARKE AND WRIGHT STORM THE ENEMY'S LINE--BATTLES BEFORE

PETERSBURG.



Sheridan reached City Point on the 26th day of March.  His

horses, of course, were jaded and many of them had lost their

shoes.  A few days of rest were necessary to recuperate the

animals and also to have them shod and put in condition for

moving.  Immediately on General Sheridan's arrival at City Point

I prepared his instructions for the move which I had decided

upon.  The movement was to commence on the 29th of the month.



After reading the instructions I had given him, Sheridan walked

out of my tent, and I followed to have some conversation with

him by himself--not in the presence of anybody else, even of a

member of my staff.  In preparing his instructions I

contemplated just what took place; that is to say, capturing

Five Forks, driving the enemy from Petersburg and Richmond and

terminating the contest before separating from the enemy.  But

the Nation had already become restless and discouraged at the

prolongation of the war, and many believed that it would never

terminate except by compromise.  Knowing that unless my plan

proved an entire success it would be interpreted as a disastrous

defeat, I provided in these instructions that in a certain event

he was to cut loose from the Army of the Potomac and his base of

supplies, and living upon the country proceed south by the way of

the Danville Railroad, or near it, across the Roanoke, get in the

rear of Johnston, who was guarding that road, and cooperate with

Sherman in destroying Johnston; then with these combined forces

to help carry out the instructions which Sherman already had

received, to act in cooperation with the armies around

Petersburg and Richmond.



I saw that after Sheridan had read his instructions he seemed

somewhat disappointed at the idea, possibly, of having to cut

loose again from the Army of the Potomac, and place himself

between the two main armies of the enemy.  I said to him:

"General, this portion of your instructions I have put in merely

as a blind;" and gave him the reason for doing so, heretofore

described.  I told him that, as a matter of fact, I intended to

close the war right here, with this movement, and that he should

go no farther.  His face at once brightened up, and slapping his

hand on his leg he said:  "I am glad to hear it, and we can do

it."



Sheridan was not however to make his movement against Five Forks

until he got further instructions from me.



One day, after the movement I am about to describe had

commenced, and when his cavalry was on our extreme left and far

to the rear, south, Sheridan rode up to where my headquarters

were then established, at Dabney's Mills.  He met some of my

staff officers outside, and was highly jubilant over the

prospects of success, giving reasons why he believed this would

prove the final and successful effort.  Although my

chief-of-staff had urged very strongly that we return to our

position about City Point and in the lines around Petersburg, he

asked Sheridan to come in to see me and say to me what he had

been saying to them.  Sheridan felt a little modest about giving

his advice where it had not been asked; so one of my staff came

in and told me that Sheridan had what they considered important

news, and suggested that I send for him.  I did so, and was glad

to see the spirit of confidence with which he was imbued. Knowing

as I did from experience, of what great value that feeling of

confidence by a commander was, I determined to make a movement

at once, although on account of the rains which had fallen after

I had started out the roads were still very heavy.  Orders were

given accordingly.



Finally the 29th of March came, and fortunately there having

been a few days free from rain, the surface of the ground was

dry, giving indications that the time had come when we could

move.  On that date I moved out with all the army available

after leaving sufficient force to hold the line about

Petersburg.  It soon set in raining again however, and in a very

short time the roads became practically impassable for teams, and

almost so for cavalry.  Sometimes a horse or mule would be

standing apparently on firm ground, when all at once one foot

would sink, and as he commenced scrambling to catch himself all

his feet would sink and he would have to be drawn by hand out of

the quicksands so common in that part of Virginia and other

southern States.  It became necessary therefore to build

corduroy roads every foot of the way as we advanced, to move our

artillery upon.  The army had become so accustomed to this kind

of work, and were so well prepared for it, that it was done very

rapidly.  The next day, March 30th, we had made sufficient

progress to the south-west to warrant me in starting Sheridan

with his cavalry over by Dinwiddie with instructions to then

come up by the road leading north-west to Five Forks, thus

menacing the right of Lee's line.



This movement was made for the purpose of extending our lines to

the west as far as practicable towards the enemy's extreme right,

or Five Forks.  The column moving detached from the army still in

the trenches was, excluding the cavalry, very small.  The forces

in the trenches were themselves extending to the left flank.

Warren was on the extreme left when the extension began, but

Humphreys was marched around later and thrown into line between

him and Five Forks.



My hope was that Sheridan would be able to carry Five Forks, get

on the enemy's right flank and rear, and force them to weaken

their centre to protect their right so that an assault in the

centre might be successfully made.  General Wright's corps had

been designated to make this assault, which I intended to order

as soon as information reached me of Sheridan's success.  He was

to move under cover as close to the enemy as he could get.



It is natural to suppose that Lee would understand my design to

be to get up to the South Side and ultimately to the Danville

Railroad, as soon as he had heard of the movement commenced on

the 29th.  These roads were so important to his very existence

while he remained in Richmond and Petersburg, and of such vital

importance to him even in case of retreat, that naturally he

would make most strenuous efforts to defend them.  He did on the

30th send Pickett with five brigades to reinforce Five Forks.  He

also sent around to the right of his army some two or three other

divisions, besides directing that other troops be held in

readiness on the north side of the James River to come over on

call.  He came over himself to superintend in person the defence

of his right flank.



Sheridan moved back to Dinwiddie Court-House on the night of the

30th, and then took a road leading north-west to Five Forks.  He

had only his cavalry with him.  Soon encountering the rebel

cavalry he met with a very stout resistance.  He gradually drove

them back however until in the neighborhood of Five Forks.  Here

he had to encounter other troops besides those he had been

contending with, and was forced to give way.



In this condition of affairs he notified me of what had taken

place and stated that he was falling back toward Dinwiddie

gradually and slowly, and asked me to send Wright's corps to his

assistance.  I replied to him that it was impossible to send

Wright's corps because that corps was already in line close up

to the enemy, where we should want to assault when the proper

time came, and was besides a long distance from him; but the 2d

(Humphreys's) and 5th (Warren's) corps were on our extreme left

and a little to the rear of it in a position to threaten the

left flank of the enemy at Five Forks, and that I would send

Warren.



Accordingly orders were sent to Warren to move at once that

night (the 31st) to Dinwiddie Court House and put himself in

communication with Sheridan as soon as possible, and report to

him.  He was very slow in moving, some of his troops not

starting until after 5 o'clock next morning.  When he did move

it was done very deliberately, and on arriving at Gravelly Run

he found the stream swollen from the recent rains so that he

regarded it as not fordable.  Sheridan of course knew of his

coming, and being impatient to get the troops up as soon as

possible, sent orders to him to hasten.  He was also hastened or

at least ordered to move up rapidly by General Meade.  He now

felt that he could not cross that creek without bridges, and his

orders were changed to move so as to strike the pursuing enemy in

flank or get in their rear; but he was so late in getting up that

Sheridan determined to move forward without him.  However,

Ayres's division of Warren's corps reached him in time to be in

the fight all day, most of the time separated from the remainder

of the 5th corps and fighting directly under Sheridan.



Warren reported to Sheridan about 11 o'clock on the 1st, but the

whole of his troops were not up so as to be much engaged until

late in the afternoon.  Griffin's division in backing to get out

of the way of a severe cross fire of the enemy was found marching

away from the fighting.  This did not continue long, however; the

division was brought back and with Ayres's division did most

excellent service during the day.  Crawford's division of the

same corps had backed still farther off, and although orders

were sent repeatedly to bring it up, it was late before it

finally got to where it could be of material assistance.  Once

there it did very excellent service.



Sheridan succeeded by the middle of the afternoon or a little

later, in advancing up to the point from which to make his

designed assault upon Five Forks itself.  He was very impatient

to make the assault and have it all over before night, because

the ground he occupied would be untenable for him in bivouac

during the night.  Unless the assault was made and was

successful, he would be obliged to return to Dinwiddie

Court-House, or even further than that for the night.



It was at this junction of affairs that Sheridan wanted to get

Crawford's division in hand, and he also wanted Warren.  He sent

staff officer after staff officer in search of Warren, directing

that general to report to him, but they were unable to find

him.  At all events Sheridan was unable to get that officer to

him.  Finally he went himself.  He issued an order relieving

Warren and assigning Griffin to the command of the 5th corps.

The troops were then brought up and the assault successfully

made.



I was so much dissatisfied with Warren's dilatory movements in

the battle of White Oak Road and in his failure to reach

Sheridan in time, that I was very much afraid that at the last

moment he would fail Sheridan.  He was a man of fine

intelligence, great earnestness, quick perception, and could

make his dispositions as quickly as any officer, under

difficulties where he was forced to act.  But I had before

discovered a defect which was beyond his control, that was very

prejudicial to his usefulness in emergencies like the one just

before us.  He could see every danger at a glance before he had

encountered it.  He would not only make preparations to meet the

danger which might occur, but he would inform his commanding

officer what others should do while he was executing his move.



I had sent a staff officer to General Sheridan to call his

attention to these defects, and to say that as much as I liked

General Warren, now was not a time when we could let our

personal feelings for any one stand in the way of success; and

if his removal was necessary to success, not to hesitate.  It

was upon that authorization that Sheridan removed Warren.  I was

very sorry that it had been done, and regretted still more that I

had not long before taken occasion to assign him to another field

of duty.



It was dusk when our troops under Sheridan went over the

parapets of the enemy.  The two armies were mingled together

there for a time in such manner that it was almost a question

which one was going to demand the surrender of the other.  Soon,

however, the enemy broke and ran in every direction; some six

thousand prisoners, besides artillery and small-arms in large

quantities, falling into our hands.  The flying troops were

pursued in different directions, the cavalry and 5th corps under

Sheridan pursuing the larger body which moved north-west.



This pursuit continued until about nine o'clock at night, when

Sheridan halted his troops, and knowing the importance to him of

the part of the enemy's line which had been captured, returned,

sending the 5th corps across Hatcher's Run to just south-west of

Petersburg, and facing them toward it.  Merritt, with the

cavalry, stopped and bivouacked west of Five Forks.



This was the condition which affairs were in on the night of the

1st of April.  I then issued orders for an assault by Wright and

Parke at four o'clock on the morning of the 2d.  I also ordered

the 2d corps, General Humphreys, and General Ord with the Army

of the James, on the left, to hold themselves in readiness to

take any advantage that could be taken from weakening in their

front.



I notified Mr. Lincoln at City Point of the success of the day;

in fact I had reported to him during the day and evening as I

got news, because he was so much interested in the movements

taking place that I wanted to relieve his mind as much as I

could.  I notified Weitzel on the north side of the James River,

directing him, also, to keep close up to the enemy, and take

advantage of the withdrawal of troops from there to promptly

enter the city of Richmond.



I was afraid that Lee would regard the possession of Five Forks

as of so much importance that he would make a last desperate

effort to retake it, risking everything upon the cast of a

single die.  It was for this reason that I had ordered the

assault to take place at once, as soon as I had received the

news of the capture of Five Forks.  The corps commanders,

however, reported that it was so dark that the men could not see

to move, and it would be impossible to make the assault then. But

we kept up a continuous artillery fire upon the enemy around the

whole line including that north of the James River, until it was

light enough to move, which was about a quarter to five in the

morning.



At that hour Parke's and Wright's corps moved out as directed,

brushed the abatis from their front as they advanced under a

heavy fire of musketry and artillery, and went without flinching

directly on till they mounted the parapets and threw themselves

inside of the enemy's line.  Parke, who was on the right, swept

down to the right and captured a very considerable length of

line in that direction, but at that point the outer was so near

the inner line which closely enveloped the city of Petersburg

that he could make no advance forward and, in fact, had a very

serious task to turn the lines which he had captured to the

defence of his own troops and to hold them; but he succeeded in

this.



Wright swung around to his left and moved to Hatcher's Run,

sweeping everything before him.  The enemy had traverses in rear

of his captured line, under cover of which he made something of a

stand, from one to another, as Wright moved on; but the latter

met no serious obstacle.  As you proceed to the left the outer

line becomes gradually much farther from the inner one, and

along about Hatcher's Run they must be nearly two miles apart.

Both Parke and Wright captured a considerable amount of

artillery and some prisoners--Wright about three thousand of

them.



In the meantime Ord and Humphreys, in obedience to the

instructions they had received, had succeeded by daylight, or

very early in the morning, in capturing the intrenched

picket-lines in their front; and before Wright got up to that

point, Ord had also succeeded in getting inside of the enemy's

intrenchments.  The second corps soon followed; and the outer

works of Petersburg were in the hands of the National troops,

never to be wrenched from them again.  When Wright reached

Hatcher's Run, he sent a regiment to destroy the South Side

Railroad just outside of the city.



My headquarters were still at Dabney's saw-mills.  As soon as I

received the news of Wright's success, I sent dispatches

announcing the fact to all points around the line, including the

troops at Bermuda Hundred and those on the north side of the

James, and to the President at City Point.  Further dispatches

kept coming in, and as they did I sent the additional news to

these points.  Finding at length that they were all in, I

mounted my horse to join the troops who were inside the works.

When I arrived there I rode my horse over the parapet just as

Wright's three thousand prisoners were coming out.  I was soon

joined inside by General Meade and his staff.



Lee made frantic efforts to recover at least part of the lost

ground.  Parke on our right was repeatedly assaulted, but

repulsed every effort.  Before noon Longstreet was ordered up

from the north side of the James River thus bringing the bulk of

Lee's army around to the support of his extreme right.  As soon

as I learned this I notified Weitzel and directed him to keep up

close to the enemy and to have Hartsuff, commanding the Bermuda

Hundred front, to do the same thing, and if they found any break

to go in; Hartsuff especially should do so, for this would

separate Richmond and Petersburg.



Sheridan, after he had returned to Five Forks, swept down to

Petersburg, coming in on our left.  This gave us a continuous

line from the Appomattox River below the city to the same river

above.  At eleven o'clock, not having heard from Sheridan, I

reinforced Parke with two brigades from City Point.  With this

additional force he completed his captured works for better

defence, and built back from his right, so as to protect his

flank.  He also carried in and made an abatis between himself

and the enemy.  Lee brought additional troops and artillery

against Parke even after this was done, and made several

assaults with very heavy losses.



The enemy had in addition to their intrenched line close up to

Petersburg, two enclosed works outside of it, Fort Gregg and

Fort Whitworth.  We thought it had now become necessary to carry

them by assault.  About one o'clock in the day, Fort Gregg was

assaulted by Foster's division of the 24th corps (Gibbon's),

supported by two brigades from Ord's command.  The battle was

desperate and the National troops were repulsed several times;

but it was finally carried, and immediately the troops in Fort

Whitworth evacuated the place.  The guns of Fort Gregg were

turned upon the retreating enemy, and the commanding officer

with some sixty of the men of Fort Whitworth surrendered.



I had ordered Miles in the morning to report to Sheridan.  In

moving to execute this order he came upon the enemy at the

intersection of the White Oak Road and the Claiborne Road.  The

enemy fell back to Sutherland Station on the South Side Road and

were followed by Miles.  This position, naturally a strong and

defensible one, was also strongly intrenched.  Sheridan now came

up and Miles asked permission from him to make the assault, which

Sheridan gave.  By this time Humphreys had got through the outer

works in his front, and came up also and assumed command over

Miles, who commanded a division in his corps.  I had sent an

order to Humphreys to turn to his right and move towards

Petersburg.  This order he now got, and started off, thus

leaving Miles alone.  The latter made two assaults, both of

which failed, and he had to fall back a few hundred yards.



Hearing that Miles had been left in this position, I directed

Humphreys to send a division back to his relief.  He went

himself.



Sheridan before starting to sweep down to Petersburg had sent

Merritt with his cavalry to the west to attack some Confederate

cavalry that had assembled there.  Merritt drove them north to

the Appomattox River.  Sheridan then took the enemy at

Sutherland Station on the reverse side from where Miles was, and

the two together captured the place, with a large number of

prisoners and some pieces of artillery, and put the remainder,

portions of three Confederate corps, to flight.  Sheridan

followed, and drove them until night, when further pursuit was

stopped.  Miles bivouacked for the night on the ground which he

with Sheridan had carried so handsomely by assault.  I cannot

explain the situation here better than by giving my dispatch to

City Point that evening:





BOYDTON ROAD, NEAR PETERSBURG,

April 2, 1865.--4.40 P.M.



COLONEL T. S. BOWERS,

City Point.



We are now up and have a continuous line of troops, and in a few

hours will be intrenched from the Appomattox below Petersburg to

the river above.  Heth's and Wilcox's divisions, such part of

them as were not captured, were cut off from town, either

designedly on their part or because they could not help it.

Sheridan with the cavalry and 5th corps is above them.  Miles's

division, 2d corps, was sent from the White Oak Road to

Sutherland Station on the South Side Railroad, where he met

them, and at last accounts was engaged with them.  Not knowing

whether Sheridan would get up in time, General Humphreys was

sent with another division from here.  The whole captures since

the army started out gunning will amount to not less than twelve

thousand men, and probably fifty pieces of artillery.  I do not

know the number of men and guns accurately however.  * * *  I

think the President might come out and pay us a visit tomorrow.



U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.





During the night of April 2d our line was intrenched from the

river above to the river below.  I ordered a bombardment to be

commenced the next morning at five A.M., to be followed by an

assault at six o'clock; but the enemy evacuated Petersburg early

in the morning.
