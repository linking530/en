OPERATIONS IN MISSISSIPPI--LONGSTREET IN EAST TENNESSEE

--COMMISSIONED LIEUTENANT-GENERAL--COMMANDING THE ARMIES OF THE

UNITED STATES--FIRST INTERVIEW WITH PRESIDENT LINCOLN.



Soon after his return from Knoxville I ordered Sherman to

distribute his forces from Stevenson to Decatur and thence north

to Nashville; Sherman suggested that he be permitted to go back

to Mississippi, to the limits of his own department and where

most of his army still remained, for the purpose of clearing out

what Confederates might still be left on the east bank of the

Mississippi River to impede its navigation by our boats.  He

expected also to have the co-operation of Banks to do the same

thing on the west shore.  Of course I approved heartily.



About the 10th of January Sherman was back in Memphis, where

Hurlbut commanded, and got together his Memphis men, or ordered

them collected and sent to Vicksburg.  He then went to Vicksburg

and out to where McPherson was in command, and had him organize

his surplus troops so as to give him about 20,000 men in all.



Sherman knew that General (Bishop) Polk was occupying Meridian

with his headquarters, and had two divisions of infantry with a

considerable force of cavalry scattered west of him.  He

determined, therefore, to move directly upon Meridian.



I had sent some 2,500 cavalry under General Sooy Smith to

Sherman's department, and they had mostly arrived before Sherman

got to Memphis.  Hurlbut had 7,000 cavalry, and Sherman ordered

him to reinforce Smith so as to give the latter a force of about

7,000 with which to go against Forrest, who was then known to be

south-east from Memphis.  Smith was ordered to move about the

1st of February.



While Sherman was waiting at Vicksburg for the arrival of

Hurlbut with his surplus men, he sent out scouts to ascertain

the position and strength of the enemy and to bring back all the

information they could gather.  When these scouts returned it was

through them that he got the information of General Polk's being

at Meridian, and of the strength and disposition of his command.



Forrest had about 4,000 cavalry with him, composed of thoroughly

well-disciplined men, who under so able a leader were very

effective.  Smith's command was nearly double that of Forrest,

but not equal, man to man, for the lack of a successful

experience such as Forrest's men had had.  The fact is, troops

who have fought a few battles and won, and followed up their

victories, improve upon what they were before to an extent that

can hardly be counted by percentage.  The difference in result

is often decisive victory instead of inglorious defeat.  This

same difference, too, is often due to the way troops are

officered, and for the particular kind of warfare which Forrest

had carried on neither army could present a more effective

officer than he was.



Sherman got off on the 3d of February and moved out on his

expedition, meeting with no opposition whatever until he crossed

the Big Black, and with no great deal of opposition after that

until he reached Jackson, Mississippi.  This latter place he

reached on the 6th or 7th, Brandon on the 8th, and Morton on the

9th.  Up to this time he moved in two columns to enable him to

get a good supply of forage, etc., and expedite the march. Here,

however, there were indications of the concentration of

Confederate infantry, and he was obliged to keep his army close

together.  He had no serious engagement; but he met some of the

enemy who destroyed a few of his wagons about Decatur,

Mississippi, where, by the way, Sherman himself came near being

picked up.



He entered Meridian on the 14th of the month, the enemy having

retreated toward Demopolis, Alabama. He spent several days in

Meridian in thoroughly destroying the railroad to the north and

south, and also for the purpose of hearing from Sooy Smith, who

he supposed had met Forrest before this time and he hoped had

gained a decisive victory because of a superiority of numbers.

Hearing nothing of him, however, he started on his return trip

to Vicksburg.  There he learned that Smith, while waiting for a

few of his men who had been ice-bound in the Ohio River, instead

of getting off on the 1st as expected, had not left until the

11th.  Smith did meet Forrest, but the result was decidedly in

Forrest's favor.



Sherman had written a letter to Banks, proposing a co-operative

movement with him against Shreveport, subject to my approval.  I

disapproved of Sherman's going himself, because I had other

important work for him to do, but consented that he might send a

few troops to the aid of Banks, though their time to remain

absent must be limited.  We must have them for the spring

campaign.  The trans-Mississippi movement proved abortive.



My eldest son, who had accompanied me on the Vicksburg campaign

and siege, had while there contracted disease, which grew worse,

until he had grown so dangerously ill that on the 24th of January

I obtained permission to go to St. Louis, where he was staying at

the time, to see him, hardly expecting to find him alive on my

arrival.  While I was permitted to go, I was not permitted to

turn over my command to any one else, but was directed to keep

the headquarters with me and to communicate regularly with all

parts of my division and with Washington, just as though I had

remained at Nashville.



When I obtained this leave I was at Chattanooga, having gone

there again to make preparations to have the troops of Thomas in

the southern part of Tennessee co-operate with Sherman's movement

in Mississippi.  I directed Thomas, and Logan who was at

Scottsboro, Alabama, to keep up a threatening movement to the

south against J. E. Johnston, who had again relieved Bragg, for

the purpose of making him keep as many troops as possible there.



I learned through Confederate sources that Johnston had already

sent two divisions in the direction of Mobile, presumably to

operate against Sherman, and two more divisions to Longstreet in

East Tennessee.  Seeing that Johnston had depleted in this way, I

directed Thomas to send at least ten thousand men, besides

Stanley's division which was already to the east, into East

Tennessee, and notified Schofield, who was now in command in

East Tennessee, of this movement of troops into his department

and also of the reinforcements Longstreet had received.  My

object was to drive Longstreet out of East Tennessee as a part

of the preparations for my spring campaign.



About this time General Foster, who had been in command of the

Department of the Ohio after Burnside until Schofield relieved

him (*21), advised me that he thought it would be a good thing

to keep Longstreet just where he was; that he was perfectly

quiet in East Tennessee, and if he was forced to leave there,

his whole well-equipped army would be free to go to any place

where it could effect the most for their cause.  I thought the

advice was good, and, adopting that view, countermanded the

orders for pursuit of Longstreet.



On the 12th of February I ordered Thomas to take Dalton and hold

it, if possible; and I directed him to move without delay.

Finding that he had not moved, on the 17th I urged him again to

start, telling him how important it was, that the object of the

movement was to co-operate with Sherman, who was moving eastward

and might be in danger.  Then again on the 21st, he not yet

having started, I asked him if he could not start the next

day.  He finally got off on the 22d or 23d.  The enemy fell back

from his front without a battle, but took a new position quite as

strong and farther to the rear.  Thomas reported that he could

not go any farther, because it was impossible with his poor

teams, nearly starved, to keep up supplies until the railroads

were repaired.  He soon fell back.



Schofield also had to return for the same reason.  He could not

carry supplies with him, and Longstreet was between him and the

supplies still left in the country.  Longstreet, in his retreat,

would be moving towards his supplies, while our forces,

following, would be receding from theirs.  On the 2d of March,

however, I learned of Sherman's success, which eased my mind

very much.  The next day, the 3d, I was ordered to Washington.



The bill restoring the grade of lieutenant-general of the army

had passed through Congress and became a law on the 26th of

February.  My nomination had been sent to the Senate on the 1st

of March and confirmed the next day (the 2d).  I was ordered to

Washington on the 3d to receive my commission, and started the

day following that.  The commission was handed to me on the

9th.  It was delivered to me at the Executive Mansion by

President Lincoln in the presence of his Cabinet, my eldest son,

those of my staff who were with me and and a few other visitors.



The President in presenting my commission read from a

paper--stating, however, as a preliminary, and prior to the

delivery of it, that he had drawn that up on paper, knowing my

disinclination to speak in public, and handed me a copy in

advance so that I might prepare a few lines of reply.  The

President said:



"General Grant, the nation's appreciation of what you have done,

and its reliance upon you for what remains to be done in the

existing great struggle, are now presented, with this commission

constituting you lieutenant-general in the Army of the United

States.  With this high honor, devolves upon you, also, a

corresponding responsibility.  As the country herein trusts you,

so, under God, it will sustain you.  I scarcely need to add,

that, with what I here speak for the nation, goes my own hearty

personal concurrence."



To this I replied:  "Mr. President, I accept the commission,

with gratitude for the high honor conferred.  With the aid of

the noble armies that have fought in so many fields for our

common country, it will be my earnest endeavor not to disappoint

your expectations.  I feel the full weight of the

responsibilities now devolving on me; and I know that if they

are met, it will be due to those armies, and above all, to the

favor of that Providence which leads both nations and men."



On the 10th I visited the headquarters of the Army of the

Potomac at Brandy Station; then returned to Washington, and

pushed west at once to make my arrangements for turning over the

commands there and giving general directions for the preparations

to be made for the spring campaign.



It had been my intention before this to remain in the West, even

if I was made lieutenant-general; but when I got to Washington

and saw the situation it was plain that here was the point for

the commanding general to be.  No one else could, probably,

resist the pressure that would be brought to bear upon him to

desist from his own plans and pursue others.  I determined,

therefore, before I started back to have Sherman advanced to my

late position, McPherson to Sherman's in command of the

department, and Logan to the command of McPherson's corps. These

changes were all made on my recommendation and without

hesitation.  My commission as lieutenant-general was given to me

on the 9th of March, 1864.  On the following day, as already

stated, I visited General Meade, commanding the Army of the

Potomac, at his headquarters at Brandy Station, north of the

Rapidan.  I had known General Meade slightly in the Mexican war,

but had not met him since until this visit.  I was a stranger to

most of the Army of the Potomac, I might say to all except the

officers of the regular army who had served in the Mexican

war.  There had been some changes ordered in the organization of

that army before my promotion.  One was the consolidation of five

corps into three, thus throwing some officers of rank out of

important commands.  Meade evidently thought that I might want

to make still one more change not yet ordered.  He said to me

that I might want an officer who had served with me in the West,

mentioning Sherman specially, to take his place.  If so, he

begged me not to hesitate about making the change.  He urged

that the work before us was of such vast importance to the whole

nation that the feeling or wishes of no one person should stand

in the way of selecting the right men for all positions.  For

himself, he would serve to the best of his ability wherever

placed.  I assured him that I had no thought of substituting any

one for him.  As to Sherman, he could not be spared from the

West.



This incident gave me even a more favorable opinion of Meade

than did his great victory at Gettysburg the July before.  It is

men who wait to be selected, and not those who seek, from whom we

may always expect the most efficient service.



Meade's position afterwards proved embarrassing to me if not to

him.  He was commanding an army and, for nearly a year previous

to my taking command of all the armies, was in supreme command

of the Army of the Potomac--except from the authorities at

Washington.  All other general officers occupying similar

positions were independent in their commands so far as any one

present with them was concerned.  I tried to make General

Meade's position as nearly as possible what it would have been

if I had been in Washington or any other place away from his

command.  I therefore gave all orders for the movements of the

Army of the Potomac to Meade to have them executed.  To avoid

the necessity of having to give orders direct, I established my

headquarters near his, unless there were reasons for locating

them elsewhere.  This sometimes happened, and I had on occasions

to give orders direct to the troops affected.  On the 11th I

returned to Washington and, on the day after, orders were

published by the War Department placing me in command of all the

armies.  I had left Washington the night before to return to my

old command in the West and to meet Sherman whom I had

telegraphed to join me in Nashville.



Sherman assumed command of the military division of the

Mississippi on the 18th of March, and we left Nashville together

for Cincinnati.  I had Sherman accompany me that far on my way

back to Washington so that we could talk over the matters about

which I wanted to see him, without losing any more time from my

new command than was necessary.  The first point which I wished

to discuss was particularly about the co-operation of his

command with mine when the spring campaign should commence.

There were also other and minor points, minor as compared with

the great importance of the question to be decided by sanguinary

war--the restoration to duty of officers who had been relieved

from important commands, namely McClellan, Burnside and Fremont

in the East, and Buell, McCook, Negley and Crittenden in the

West.



Some time in the winter of 1863-64 I had been invited by the

general-in-chief to give my views of the campaign I thought

advisable for the command under me--now Sherman's.  General J.

E. Johnston was defending Atlanta and the interior of Georgia

with an army, the largest part of which was stationed at Dalton,

about 38 miles south of Chattanooga. Dalton is at the junction of

the railroad from Cleveland with the one from Chattanooga to

Atlanta.



There could have been no difference of opinion as to the first

duty of the armies of the military division of the

Mississippi.  Johnston's army was the first objective, and that

important railroad centre, Atlanta, the second.  At the time I

wrote General Halleck giving my views of the approaching

campaign, and at the time I met General Sherman, it was expected

that General Banks would be through with the campaign which he

had been ordered upon before my appointment to the command of

all the armies, and would be ready to co-operate with the armies

east of the Mississippi, his part in the programme being to move

upon Mobile by land while the navy would close the harbor and

assist to the best of its ability. (*22) The plan therefore was

for Sherman to attack Johnston and destroy his army if possible,

to capture Atlanta and hold it, and with his troops and those of

Banks to hold a line through to Mobile, or at least to hold

Atlanta and command the railroad running east and west, and the

troops from one or other of the armies to hold important points

on the southern road, the only east and west road that would be

left in the possession of the enemy.  This would cut the

Confederacy in two again, as our gaining possession of the

Mississippi River had done before.  Banks was not ready in time

for the part assigned to him, and circumstances that could not

be foreseen determined the campaign which was afterwards made,

the success and grandeur of which has resounded throughout all

lands.



In regard to restoring officers who had been relieved from

important commands to duty again, I left Sherman to look after

those who had been removed in the West while I looked out for

the rest.  I directed, however, that he should make no

assignment until I could speak to the Secretary of War about the

matter.  I shortly after recommended to the Secretary the

assignment of General Buell to duty.  I received the assurance

that duty would be offered to him; and afterwards the Secretary

told me that he had offered Buell an assignment and that the

latter had declined it, saying that it would be degradation to

accept the assignment offered.  I understood afterwards that he

refused to serve under either Sherman or Canby because he had

ranked them both.  Both graduated before him and ranked him in

the old army.  Sherman ranked him as a brigadier-general.  All

of them ranked me in the old army, and Sherman and Buell did as

brigadiers.  The worse excuse a soldier can make for declining

service is that he once ranked the commander he is ordered to

report to.



On the 23d of March I was back in Washington, and on the 26th

took up my headquarters at Culpeper Court-House, a few miles

south of the headquarters of the Army of the Potomac.



Although hailing from Illinois myself, the State of the

President, I never met Mr. Lincoln until called to the capital

to receive my commission as lieutenant-general.  I knew him,

however, very well and favorably from the accounts given by

officers under me at the West who had known him all their

lives.  I had also read the remarkable series of debates between

Lincoln and Douglas a few years before, when they were rival

candidates for the United States Senate.  I was then a resident

of Missouri, and by no means a "Lincoln man" in that contest;

but I recognized then his great ability.



In my first interview with Mr. Lincoln alone he stated to me

that he had never professed to be a military man or to know how

campaigns should be conducted, and never wanted to interfere in

them:  but that procrastination on the part of commanders, and

the pressure from the people at the North and Congress, WHICH

WAS ALWAYS WITH HIM, forced him into issuing his series of

"Military Orders"--one, two, three, etc.  He did not know but

they were all wrong, and did know that some of them were.  All

he wanted or had ever wanted was some one who would take the

responsibility and act, and call on him for all the assistance

needed, pledging himself to use all the power of the government

in rendering such assistance.  Assuring him that I would do the

best I could with the means at hand, and avoid as far as

possible annoying him or the War Department, our first interview

ended.



The Secretary of War I had met once before only, but felt that I

knew him better.



While commanding in West Tennessee we had occasionally held

conversations over the wires, at night, when they were not being

otherwise used.  He and General Halleck both cautioned me against

giving the President my plans of campaign, saying that he was so

kind-hearted, so averse to refusing anything asked of him, that

some friend would be sure to get from him all he knew.  I should

have said that in our interview the President told me he did not

want to know what I proposed to do.  But he submitted a plan of

campaign of his own which he wanted me to hear and then do as I

pleased about.  He brought out a map of Virginia on which he had

evidently marked every position occupied by the Federal and

Confederate armies up to that time.  He pointed out on the map

two streams which empty into the Potomac, and suggested that the

army might be moved on boats and landed between the mouths of

these streams.  We would then have the Potomac to bring our

supplies, and the tributaries would protect our flanks while we

moved out.  I listened respectfully, but did not suggest that

the same streams would protect Lee's flanks while he was

shutting us up.



I did not communicate my plans to the President, nor did I to

the Secretary of War or to General Halleck.



March the 26th my headquarters were, as stated, at Culpeper, and

the work of preparing for an early campaign commenced.
