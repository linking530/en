PREPARATIONS FOR BATTLE--THOMAS CARRIES THE FIRST LINE OF THE

ENEMY--SHERMAN CARRIES MISSIONARY RIDGE--BATTLE OF LOOKOUT

MOUNTAIN--GENERAL HOOKER'S FIGHT.



On the 20th, when so much was occurring to discourage--rains

falling so heavily as to delay the passage of troops over the

river at Brown's Ferry and threatening the entire breaking of

the bridge; news coming of a battle raging at Knoxville; of

Willcox being threatened by a force from the east--a letter was

received from Bragg which contained these words:  "As there may

still be some non-combatants in Chattanooga, I deem it proper to

notify you that prudence would dictate their early withdrawal."

Of course, I understood that this was a device intended to

deceive; but I did not know what the intended deception was.  On

the 22d, however, a deserter came in who informed me that Bragg

was leaving our front, and on that day Buckner's division was

sent to reinforce Longstreet at Knoxville, and another division

started to follow but was recalled.  The object of Bragg's

letter, no doubt, was in some way to detain me until Knoxville

could be captured, and his troops there be returned to

Chattanooga.



During the night of the 21st the rest of the pontoon boats,

completed, one hundred and sixteen in all, were carried up to

and placed in North Chickamauga. The material for the roadway

over these was deposited out of view of the enemy within a few

hundred yards of the bank of the Tennessee, where the north end

of the bridge was to rest.



Hearing nothing from Burnside, and hearing much of the distress

in Washington on his account, I could no longer defer operations

for his relief.  I determined, therefore, to do on the 23d, with

the Army of the Cumberland, what had been intended to be done on

the 24th.



The position occupied by the Army of the Cumberland had been

made very strong for defence during the months it had been

besieged.  The line was about a mile from the town, and extended

from Citico Creek, a small stream running near the base of

Missionary Ridge and emptying into the Tennessee about two miles

below the mouth of the South Chickamauga, on the left, to

Chattanooga Creek on the right.  All commanding points on the

line were well fortified and well equipped with artillery.  The

important elevations within the line had all been carefully

fortified and supplied with a proper armament.  Among the

elevations so fortified was one to the east of the town, named

Fort Wood.  It owed its importance chiefly to the fact that it

lay between the town and Missionary Ridge, where most of the

strength of the enemy was.  Fort Wood had in it twenty-two

pieces of artillery, most of which would reach the nearer points

of the enemy's line.  On the morning of the 23d Thomas, according

to instructions, moved Granger's corps of two divisions, Sheridan

and T. J. Wood commanding, to the foot of Fort Wood, and formed

them into line as if going on parade, Sheridan on the right,

Wood to the left, extending to or near Citico Creek.  Palmer,

commanding the 14th corps, held that part of our line facing

south and southwest..  He supported Sheridan with one division

(Baird's), while his other division under Johnson remained in

the trenches, under arms, ready to be moved to any point.

Howard's corps was moved in rear of the centre.  The picket

lines were within a few hundred yards of each other.  At two

o'clock in the afternoon all were ready to advance.  By this

time the clouds had lifted so that the enemy could see from his

elevated position all that was going on.  The signal for advance

was given by a booming of cannon from Fort Wood and other points

on the line.  The rebel pickets were soon driven back upon the

main guards, which occupied minor and detached heights between

the main ridge and our lines.  These too were carried before

halting, and before the enemy had time to reinforce their

advance guards.  But it was not without loss on both sides. This

movement secured to us a line fully a mile in advance of the one

we occupied in the morning, and the one which the enemy had

occupied up to this time.  The fortifications were rapidly

turned to face the other way.  During the following night they

were made strong.  We lost in this preliminary action about

eleven hundred killed and wounded, while the enemy probably lost

quite as heavily, including the prisoners that were captured.

With the exception of the firing of artillery, kept up from

Missionary Ridge and Fort Wood until night closed in, this ended

the fighting for the first day.



The advantage was greatly on our side now, and if I could only

have been assured that Burnside could hold out ten days longer I

should have rested more easily.  But we were doing the best we

could for him and the cause.



By the night of the 23d Sherman's command was in a position to

move, though one division (Osterhaus's) had not yet crossed the

river at Brown's Ferry.  The continuous rise in the Tennessee

had rendered it impossible to keep the bridge at that point in

condition for troops to cross; but I was determined to move that

night even without this division.  Orders were sent to Osterhaus

accordingly to report to Hooker, if he could not cross by eight

o'clock on the morning of the 24th.  Because of the break in the

bridge, Hooker's orders were again changed, but this time only

back to those first given to him.



General W. F. Smith had been assigned to duty as Chief Engineer

of the Military Division.  To him were given the general

direction of moving troops by the boats from North Chickamauga,

laying the bridge after they reached their position, and

generally all the duties pertaining to his office of chief

engineer.  During the night General Morgan L. Smith's division

was marched to the point where the pontoons were, and the

brigade of Giles A. Smith was selected for the delicate duty of

manning the boats and surprising the enemy's pickets on the

south bank of the river.  During this night also General J. M.

Brannan, chief of artillery, moved forty pieces of artillery,

belonging to the Army of the Cumberland, and placed them on the

north side of the river so as to command the ground opposite, to

aid in protecting the approach to the point where the south end

of the bridge was to rest.  He had to use Sherman's artillery

horses for this purpose, Thomas having none.



At two o'clock in the morning, November 24th, Giles A. Smith

pushed out from the North Chickamauga with his one hundred and

sixteen boats, each loaded with thirty brave and well-armed

men.  The boats with their precious freight dropped down quietly

with the current to avoid attracting the attention of any one who

could convey information to the enemy, until arriving near the

mouth of South Chickamauga. Here a few boats were landed, the

troops debarked, and a rush was made upon the picket guard known

to be at that point.  The guard were surprised, and twenty of

their number captured.  The remainder of the troops effected a

landing at the point where the bridge was to start, with equally

good results.  The work of ferrying over Sherman's command from

the north side of the Tennessee was at once commenced, using the

pontoons for the purpose.  A steamer was also brought up from the

town to assist.  The rest of M. L. Smith's division came first,

then the division of John E. Smith.  The troops as they landed

were put to work intrenching their position.  By daylight the

two entire divisions were over, and well covered by the works

they had built.



The work of laying the bridge, on which to cross the artillery

and cavalry, was now begun.  The ferrying over the infantry was

continued with the steamer and the pontoons, taking the

pontoons, however, as fast as they were wanted to put in their

place in the bridge.  By a little past noon the bridge was

completed, as well as one over the South Chickamauga connecting

the troops left on that side with their comrades below, and all

the infantry and artillery were on the south bank of the

Tennessee.



Sherman at once formed his troops for assault on Missionary

Ridge.  By one o'clock he started with M. L. Smith on his left,

keeping nearly the course of Chickamauga River; J. E. Smith next

to the right and a little to the rear; and Ewing still farther to

the right and also a little to the rear of J. E. Smith's command,

in column, ready to deploy to the right if an enemy should come

from that direction.  A good skirmish line preceded each of

these columns.  Soon the foot of the hill was reached; the

skirmishers pushed directly up, followed closely by their

supports.  By half-past three Sherman was in possession of the

height without having sustained much loss.  A brigade from each

division was now brought up, and artillery was dragged to the

top of the hill by hand.  The enemy did not seem to be aware of

this movement until the top of the hill was gained.  There had

been a drizzling rain during the day, and the clouds were so low

that Lookout Mountain and the top of Missionary Ridge were

obscured from the view of persons in the valley.  But now the

enemy opened fire upon their assailants, and made several

attempts with their skirmishers to drive them away, but without

avail.  Later in the day a more determined attack was made, but

this, too, failed, and Sherman was left to fortify what he had

gained.



Sherman's cavalry took up its line of march soon after the

bridge was completed, and by half-past three the whole of it was

over both bridges and on its way to strike the enemy's

communications at Chickamauga Station.  All of Sherman's command

was now south of the Tennessee.  During the afternoon General

Giles A. Smith was severely wounded and carried from the field.



Thomas having done on the 23d what was expected of him on the

24th, there was nothing for him to do this day except to

strengthen his position.  Howard, however, effected a crossing

of Citico Creek and a junction with Sherman, and was directed to

report to him.  With two or three regiments of his command he

moved in the morning along the banks of the Tennessee, and

reached the point where the bridge was being laid.  He went out

on the bridge as far as it was completed from the south end, and

saw Sherman superintending the work from the north side and

moving himself south as fast as an additional boat was put in

and the roadway put upon it.  Howard reported to his new chief

across the chasm between them, which was now narrow and in a few

minutes closed.



While these operations were going on to the east of Chattanooga,

Hooker was engaged on the west.  He had three divisions:

Osterhaus's, of the 15th corps, Army of the Tennessee; Geary's,

12th corps, Army of the Potomac; and Cruft's, 14th corps, Army

of the Cumberland.  Geary was on the right at Wauhatchie, Cruft

at the centre, and Osterhaus near Brown's Ferry.  These troops

were all west of Lookout Creek.  The enemy had the east bank of

the creek strongly picketed and intrenched, and three brigades

of troops in the rear to reinforce them if attacked.  These

brigades occupied the summit of the mountain.  General Carter L.

Stevenson was in command of the whole.  Why any troops, except

artillery with a small infantry guard, were kept on the

mountain-top, I do not see.  A hundred men could have held the

summit--which is a palisade for more than thirty feet

down--against the assault of any number of men from the position

Hooker occupied.



The side of Lookout Mountain confronting Hooker's command was

rugged, heavily timbered, and full of chasms, making it

difficult to advance with troops, even in the absence of an

opposing force.  Farther up, the ground becomes more even and

level, and was in cultivation.  On the east side the slope is

much more gradual, and a good wagon road, zigzagging up it,

connects the town of Chattanooga with the summit.



Early on the morning of the 24th Hooker moved Geary's division,

supported by a brigade of Cruft's, up Lookout Creek, to effect a

crossing.  The remainder of Cruft's division was to seize the

bridge over the creek, near the crossing of the railroad.

Osterhaus was to move up to the bridge and cross it.  The bridge

was seized by Gross's brigade after a slight skirmish with the

pickets guarding it.  This attracted the enemy so that Geary's

movement farther up was not observed.  A heavy mist obscured him

from the view of the troops on the top of the mountain.  He

crossed the creek almost unobserved, and captured the picket of

over forty men on guard near by.  He then commenced ascending

the mountain directly in his front.  By this time the enemy was

seen coming down from their camps on the mountain slope, and

filing into their rifle-pits to contest the crossing of the

bridge.  By eleven o'clock the bridge was complete.  Osterhaus

was up, and after some sharp skirmishing the enemy was driven

away with considerable loss in killed and captured.



While the operations at the bridge were progressing, Geary was

pushing up the hill over great obstacles, resisted by the enemy

directly in his front, and in face of the guns on top of the

mountain.  The enemy, seeing their left flank and rear menaced,

gave way, and were followed by Cruft and Osterhaus.  Soon these

were up abreast of Geary, and the whole command pushed up the

hill, driving the enemy in advance.  By noon Geary had gained

the open ground on the north slope of the mountain, with his

right close up to the base of the upper palisade, but there were

strong fortifications in his front.  The rest of the command

coming up, a line was formed from the base of the upper palisade

to the mouth of Chattanooga Creek.



Thomas and I were on the top of Orchard Knob.  Hooker's advance

now made our line a continuous one.  It was in full view,

extending from the Tennessee River, where Sherman had crossed,

up Chickamauga River to the base of Mission Ridge, over the top

of the north end of the ridge to Chattanooga Valley, then along

parallel to the ridge a mile or more, across the valley to the

mouth of Chattanooga Creek, thence up the slope of Lookout

Mountain to the foot of the upper palisade.  The day was hazy,

so that Hooker's operations were not visible to us except at

moments when the clouds would rise.  But the sound of his

artillery and musketry was heard incessantly.  The enemy on his

front was partially fortified, but was soon driven out of his

works.  During the afternoon the clouds, which had so obscured

the top of Lookout all day as to hide whatever was going on from

the view of those below, settled down and made it so dark where

Hooker was as to stop operations for the time.  At four o'clock

Hooker reported his position as impregnable.  By a little after

five direct communication was established, and a brigade of

troops was sent from Chattanooga to reinforce him.  These troops

had to cross Chattanooga Creek and met with some opposition, but

soon overcame it, and by night the commander, General Carlin,

reported to Hooker and was assigned to his left.  I now

telegraphed to Washington:  "The fight to-day progressed

favorably.  Sherman carried the end of Missionary Ridge, and his

right is now at the tunnel, and his left at Chickamauga Creek.

Troops from Lookout Valley carried the point of the mountain,

and now hold the eastern slope and a point high up.  Hooker

reports two thousand prisoners taken, besides which a small

number have fallen into our hands from Missionary Ridge."  The

next day the President replied:  "Your dispatches as to fighting

on Monday and Tuesday are here.  Well done.  Many thanks to

all.  Remember Burnside."  And Halleck also telegraphed:  "I

congratulate you on the success thus far of your plans.  I fear

that Burnside is hard pushed, and that any further delay may

prove fatal.  I know you will do all in your power to relieve

him."



The division of Jefferson C. Davis, Army of the Cumberland, had

been sent to the North Chickamauga to guard the pontoons as they

were deposited in the river, and to prevent all ingress or egress

of citizens.  On the night of the 24th his division, having

crossed with Sherman, occupied our extreme left from the upper

bridge over the plain to the north base of Missionary Ridge.

Firing continued to a late hour in the night, but it was not

connected with an assault at any point.
