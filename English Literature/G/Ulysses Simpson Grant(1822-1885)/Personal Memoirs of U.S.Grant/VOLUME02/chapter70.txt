THE END OF THE WAR--THE MARCH TO WASHINGTON--ONE OF LINCOLN'S

ANECDOTES--GRAND REVIEW AT WASHINGTON--CHARACTERISTICS OF

LINCOLN AND STANTON--ESTIMATE OF THE DIFFERENT CORPS COMMANDERS.



Things began to quiet down, and as the certainty that there

would be no more armed resistance became clearer, the troops in

North Carolina and Virginia were ordered to march immediately to

the capital, and go into camp there until mustered out.  Suitable

garrisons were left at the prominent places throughout the South

to insure obedience to the laws that might be enacted for the

government of the several States, and to insure security to the

lives and property of all classes.  I do not know how far this

was necessary, but I deemed it necessary, at that time, that

such a course should be pursued.  I think now that these

garrisons were continued after they ceased to be absolutely

required; but it is not to be expected that such a rebellion as

was fought between the sections from 1861 to 1865 could

terminate without leaving many serious apprehensions in the mind

of the people as to what should be done.



Sherman marched his troops from Goldsboro, up to Manchester, on

the south side of the James River, opposite Richmond, and there

put them in camp, while he went back to Savannah to see what the

situation was there.



It was during this trip that the last outrage was committed upon

him.  Halleck had been sent to Richmond to command Virginia, and

had issued orders prohibiting even Sherman's own troops from

obeying his, Sherman's, orders.  Sherman met the papers on his

return, containing this order of Halleck, and very justly felt

indignant at the outrage.  On his arrival at Fortress Monroe

returning from Savannah, Sherman received an invitation from

Halleck to come to Richmond and be his guest.  This he

indignantly refused, and informed Halleck, furthermore, that he

had seen his order.  He also stated that he was coming up to

take command of his troops, and as he marched through it would

probably be as well for Halleck not to show himself, because he

(Sherman) would not be responsible for what some rash person

might do through indignation for the treatment he had

received.  Very soon after that, Sherman received orders from me

to proceed to Washington City, and to go into camp on the south

side of the city pending the mustering-out of the troops.



There was no incident worth noting in the march northward from

Goldsboro, to Richmond, or in that from Richmond to Washington

City.  The army, however, commanded by Sherman, which had been

engaged in all the battles of the West and had marched from the

Mississippi through the Southern States to the sea, from there

to Goldsboro, and thence to Washington City, had passed over

many of the battle-fields of the Army of the Potomac, thus

having seen, to a greater extent than any other body of troops,

the entire theatre of the four years' war for the preservation

of the Union.



The march of Sherman's army from Atlanta to the sea and north to

Goldsboro, while it was not accompanied with the danger that was

anticipated, yet was magnificent in its results, and equally

magnificent in the way it was conducted.  It had an important

bearing, in various ways, upon the great object we had in view,

that of closing the war.  All the States east of the Mississippi

River up to the State of Georgia, had felt the hardships of the

war.  Georgia, and South Carolina, and almost all of North

Carolina, up to this time, had been exempt from invasion by the

Northern armies, except upon their immediate sea coasts.  Their

newspapers had given such an account of Confederate success,

that the people who remained at home had been convinced that the

Yankees had been whipped from first to last, and driven from

pillar to post, and that now they could hardly be holding out

for any other purpose than to find a way out of the war with

honor to themselves.



Even during this march of Sherman's the newspapers in his front

were proclaiming daily that his army was nothing better than a

mob of men who were frightened out of their wits and hastening,

panic-stricken, to try to get under the cover of our navy for

protection against the Southern people.  As the army was seen

marching on triumphantly, however, the minds of the people

became disabused and they saw the true state of affairs.  In

turn they became disheartened, and would have been glad to

submit without compromise.



Another great advantage resulting from this march, and which was

calculated to hasten the end, was the fact that the great

storehouse of Georgia was entirely cut off from the Confederate

armies.  As the troops advanced north from Savannah, the

destruction of the railroads in South Carolina and the southern

part of North Carolina, further cut off their resources and left

the armies still in Virginia and North Carolina dependent for

supplies upon a very small area of country, already very much

exhausted of food and forage.



In due time the two armies, one from Burkesville Junction and

the other from the neighborhood of Raleigh, North Carolina,

arrived and went into camp near the Capital, as directed.  The

troops were hardy, being inured to fatigue, and they appeared in

their respective camps as ready and fit for duty as they had ever

been in their lives.  I doubt whether an equal body of men of any

nation, take them man for man, officer for officer, was ever

gotten together that would have proved their equal in a great

battle.



The armies of Europe are machines; the men are brave and the

officers capable; but the majority of the soldiers in most of

the nations of Europe are taken from a class of people who are

not very intelligent and who have very little interest in the

contest in which they are called upon to take part.  Our armies

were composed of men who were able to read, men who knew what

they were fighting for, and could not be induced to serve as

soldiers, except in an emergency when the safety of the nation

was involved, and so necessarily must have been more than equal

to men who fought merely because they were brave and because

they were thoroughly drilled and inured to hardships.



There was nothing of particular importance occurred during the

time these troops were in camp before starting North.



I remember one little incident which I will relate as an

anecdote characteristic of Mr. Lincoln.  It occurred a day after

I reached Washington, and about the time General Meade reached

Burkesville with the army.  Governor Smith of Virginia had left

Richmond with the Confederate States government, and had gone to

Danville.  Supposing I was necessarily with the army at

Burkesville, he addressed a letter to me there informing me

that, as governor of the Commonwealth of the State of Virginia,

he had temporarily removed the State capital from Richmond to

Danville, and asking if he would be permitted to perform the

functions of his office there without molestation by the Federal

authorities.  I give this letter only in substance.  He also

inquired of me whether in case he was not allowed to perform the

duties of his office, he with a few others might not be permitted

to leave the country and go abroad without interference.  General

Meade being informed that a flag of truce was outside his pickets

with a letter to me, at once sent out and had the letter brought

in without informing the officer who brought it that I was not

present.  He read the letter and telegraphed me its contents.

Meeting Mr. Lincoln shortly after receiving this dispatch, I

repeated its contents to him.  Mr. Lincoln, supposing I was

asking for instructions, said, in reply to that part of Governor

Smith's letter which inquired whether he with a few friends would

be permitted to leave the country unmolested, that his position

was like that of a certain Irishman (giving the name) he knew in

Springfield who was very popular with the people, a man of

considerable promise, and very much liked.  Unfortunately he had

acquired the habit of drinking, and his friends could see that

the habit was growing on him.  These friends determined to make

an effort to save him, and to do this they drew up a pledge to

abstain from all alcoholic drinks.  They asked Pat to join them

in signing the pledge, and he consented.  He had been so long

out of the habit of using plain water as a beverage that he

resorted to soda-water as a substitute.  After a few days this

began to grow distasteful to him.  So holding the glass behind

him, he said:  "Doctor, couldn't you drop a bit of brandy in

that unbeknownst to myself."



I do not remember what the instructions were the President gave

me, but I know that Governor Smith was not permitted to perform

the duties of his office.  I also know that it Mr. Lincoln had

been spared, there would have been no efforts made to prevent

any one from leaving the country who desired to do so.  He would

have been equally willing to permit the return of the same

expatriated citizens after they had time to repent of their

choice.



On the 18th of May orders were issued by the adjutant-general

for a grand review by the President and his cabinet of Sherman's

and Meade's armies.  The review commenced on the 23d and lasted

two days.  Meade's army occupied over six hours of the first day

in passing the grand stand which had been erected in front of the

President's house.  Sherman witnessed this review from the grand

stand which was occupied by the President and his cabinet.  Here

he showed his resentment for the cruel and harsh treatment that

had unnecessarily been inflicted upon him by the Secretary of

War, by refusing to take his extended hand.



Sherman's troops had been in camp on the south side of the

Potomac.  During the night of the 23d he crossed over and

bivouacked not far from the Capitol.  Promptly at ten o'clock on

the morning of the 24th, his troops commenced to pass in

review.  Sherman's army made a different appearance from that of

the Army of the Potomac.  The latter had been operating where

they received directly from the North full supplies of food and

clothing regularly:  the review of this army therefore was the

review of a body of 65,000 well-drilled, well-disciplined and

orderly soldiers inured to hardship and fit for any duty, but

without the experience of gathering their own food and supplies

in an enemy's country, and of being ever on the watch. Sherman's

army was not so well-dressed as the Army of the Potomac, but

their marching could not be excelled; they gave the appearance

of men who had been thoroughly drilled to endure hardships,

either by long and continuous marches or through exposure to any

climate, without the ordinary shelter of a camp.  They exhibited

also some of the order of march through Georgia where the "sweet

potatoes sprung up from the ground" as Sherman's army went

marching through.  In the rear of a company there would be a

captured horse or mule loaded with small cooking utensils,

captured chickens and other food picked up for the use of the

men.  Negro families who had followed the army would sometimes

come along in the rear of a company, with three or four children

packed upon a single mule, and the mother leading it.



The sight was varied and grand:  nearly all day for two

successive days, from the Capitol to the Treasury Building,

could be seen a mass of orderly soldiers marching in columns of

companies.  The National flag was flying from almost every house

and store; the windows were filled with spectators; the

door-steps and side-walks were crowded with colored people and

poor whites who did not succeed in securing better quarters from

which to get a view of the grand armies.  The city was about as

full of strangers who had come to see the sights as it usually

is on inauguration day when a new President takes his seat.



It may not be out of place to again allude to President Lincoln

and the Secretary of War, Mr. Stanton, who were the great

conspicuous figures in the executive branch of the government.

There is no great difference of opinion now, in the public mind,

as to the characteristics of the President.  With Mr. Stanton the

case is different.  They were the very opposite of each other in

almost every particular, except that each possessed great

ability.  Mr. Lincoln gained influence over men by making them

feel that it was a pleasure to serve him.  He preferred yielding

his own wish to gratify others, rather than to insist upon having

his own way.  It distressed him to disappoint others.  In matters

of public duty, however, he had what he wished, but in the least

offensive way.  Mr. Stanton never questioned his own authority

to command, unless resisted.  He cared nothing for the feeling

of others.  In fact it seemed to be pleasanter to him to

disappoint than to gratify.  He felt no hesitation in assuming

the functions of the executive, or in acting without advising

with him.  If his act was not sustained, he would change it--if

he saw the matter would be followed up until he did so.



It was generally supposed that these two officials formed the

complement of each other.  The Secretary was required to prevent

the President's being imposed upon.  The President was required

in the more responsible place of seeing that injustice was not

done to others.  I do not know that this view of these two men

is still entertained by the majority of the people.  It is not a

correct view, however, in my estimation.  Mr. Lincoln did not

require a guardian to aid him in the fulfilment of a public

trust.



Mr. Lincoln was not timid, and he was willing to trust his

generals in making and executing their plans.  The Secretary was

very timid, and it was impossible for him to avoid interfering

with the armies covering the capital when it was sought to

defend it by an offensive movement against the army guarding the

Confederate capital.  He could see our weakness, but he could not

see that the enemy was in danger.  The enemy would not have been

in danger if Mr. Stanton had been in the field.  These

characteristics of the two officials were clearly shown shortly

after Early came so near getting into the capital.



Among the army and corps commanders who served with me during

the war between the States, and who attracted much public

attention, but of whose ability as soldiers I have not yet given

any estimate, are Meade, Hancock, Sedgwick, Burnside, Terry and

Hooker.  There were others of great merit, such as Griffin,

Humphreys, Wright and Mackenzie.  Of those first named, Burnside

at one time had command of the Army of the Potomac, and later of

the Army of the Ohio.  Hooker also commanded the Army of the

Potomac for a short time.



General Meade was an officer of great merit, with drawbacks to

his usefulness that were beyond his control.  He had been an

officer of the engineer corps before the war, and consequently

had never served with troops until he was over forty-six years

of age.  He never had, I believe, a command of less than a

brigade.  He saw clearly and distinctly the position of the

enemy, and the topography of the country in front of his own

position.  His first idea was to take advantage of the lay of

the ground, sometimes without reference to the direction we

wanted to move afterwards.  He was subordinate to his superiors

in rank to the extent that he could execute an order which

changed his own plans with the same zeal he would have displayed

if the plan had been his own.  He was brave and conscientious,

and commanded the respect of all who knew him.  He was

unfortunately of a temper that would get beyond his control, at

times, and make him speak to officers of high rank in the most

offensive manner.  No one saw this fault more plainly than he

himself, and no one regretted it more.  This made it unpleasant

at times, even in battle, for those around him to approach him

even with information.  In spite of this defect he was a most

valuable officer and deserves a high place in the annals of his

country.



General Burnside was an officer who was generally liked and

respected.  He was not, however, fitted to command an army.  No

one knew this better than himself.  He always admitted his

blunders, and extenuated those of officers under him beyond what

they were entitled to.  It was hardly his fault that he was ever

assigned to a separate command.



Of Hooker I saw but little during the war.  I had known him very

well before, however.  Where I did see him, at Chattanooga, his

achievement in bringing his command around the point of Lookout

Mountain and into Chattanooga Valley was brilliant.  I

nevertheless regarded him as a dangerous man.  He was not

subordinate to his superiors.  He was ambitious to the extent of

caring nothing for the rights of others.  His disposition was,

when engaged in battle, to get detached from the main body of

the army and exercise a separate command, gathering to his

standard all he could of his juniors.



Hancock stands the most conspicuous figure of all the general

officers who did not exercise a separate command.  He commanded

a corps longer than any other one, and his name was never

mentioned as having committed in battle a blunder for which he

was responsible.  He was a man of very conspicuous personal

appearance.  Tall, well-formed and, at the time of which I now

write, young and fresh-looking, he presented an appearance that

would attract the attention of an army as he passed.  His genial

disposition made him friends, and his personal courage and his

presence with his command in the thickest of the fight won for

him the confidence of troops serving under him.  No matter how

hard the fight, the 2d corps always felt that their commander

was looking after them.



Sedgwick was killed at Spottsylvania before I had an opportunity

of forming an estimate of his qualifications as a soldier from

personal observation.  I had known him in Mexico when both of us

were lieutenants, and when our service gave no indication that

either of us would ever be equal to the command of a brigade. He

stood very high in the army, however, as an officer and a man. 

He was brave and conscientious.  His ambition was not great, and

he seemed to dread responsibility.  He was willing to do any

amount of battling, but always wanted some one else to direct. 

He declined the command of the Army of the Potomac once, if not

oftener.



General Alfred H. Terry came into the army as a volunteer

without a military education.  His way was won without political

influence up to an important separate command--the expedition

against Fort Fisher, in January, 1865.  His success there was

most brilliant, and won for him the rank of brigadier-general in

the regular army and of major-general of volunteers.  He is a man

who makes friends of those under him by his consideration of

their wants and their dues.  As a commander, he won their

confidence by his coolness in action and by his clearness of

perception in taking in the situation under which he was placed

at any given time.



Griffin, Humphreys, and Mackenzie were good corps commanders,

but came into that position so near to the close of the war as

not to attract public attention.  All three served as such, in

the last campaign of the armies of the Potomac and the James,

which culminated at Appomattox Court House, on the 9th of April,

1865.  The sudden collapse of the rebellion monopolized attention

to the exclusion of almost everything else.  I regarded Mackenzie

as the most promising young officer in the army.  Graduating at

West Point, as he did, during the second year of the war, he had

won his way up to the command of a corps before its close.  This

he did upon his own merit and without influence.
