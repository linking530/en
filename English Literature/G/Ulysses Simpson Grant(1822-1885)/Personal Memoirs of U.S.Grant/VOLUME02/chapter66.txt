BATTLE OF SAILOR'S CREEK--ENGAGEMENT AT FARMVILLE

--CORRESPONDENCE WITH GENERAL LEE--SHERIDAN INTERCEPTS THE ENEMY.



The Appomattox, going westward, takes a long sweep to the

south-west from the neighborhood of the Richmond and Danville

Railroad bridge, and then trends north-westerly.  Sailor's

Creek, an insignificant stream, running northward, empties into

the Appomattox between the High Bridge and Jetersville.  Near

the High Bridge the stage road from Petersburg to Lynchburg

crosses the Appomattox River, also on a bridge.  The railroad

runs on the north side of the river to Farmville, a few miles

west, and from there, recrossing, continues on the south side of

it.  The roads coming up from the south-east to Farmville cross

the Appomattox River there on a bridge and run on the north

side, leaving the Lynchburg and Petersburg Railroad well to the

left.



Lee, in pushing out from Amelia Court House, availed himself of

all the roads between the Danville Road and Appomattox River to

move upon, and never permitted the head of his columns to stop

because of any fighting that might be going on in his rear.  In

this way he came very near succeeding in getting to his

provision trains and eluding us with at least part of his army.



As expected, Lee's troops had moved during the night before, and

our army in moving upon Amelia Court House soon encountered

them.  There was a good deal of fighting before Sailor's Creek

was reached.  Our cavalry charged in upon a body of theirs which

was escorting a wagon train in order to get it past our left.  A

severe engagement ensued, in which we captured many prisoners,

and many men also were killed and wounded.  There was as much

gallantry displayed by some of the Confederates in these little

engagements as was displayed at any time during the war,

notwithstanding the sad defeats of the past week.



The armies finally met on Sailor's Creek, when a heavy

engagement took place, in which infantry, artillery and cavalry

were all brought into action.  Our men on the right, as they

were brought in against the enemy, came in on higher ground, and

upon his flank, giving us every advantage to be derived from the

lay of the country.  Our firing was also very much more rapid,

because the enemy commenced his retreat westward and in firing

as he retreated had to turn around every time he fired.  The

enemy's loss was very heavy, as well in killed and wounded as in

captures.  Some six general officers fell into our hands in this

engagement, and seven thousand men were made prisoners.  This

engagement was commenced in the middle of the afternoon of the

6th, and the retreat and pursuit were continued until nightfall,

when the armies bivouacked upon the ground where the night had

overtaken them.



When the move towards Amelia Court House had commenced that

morning, I ordered Wright's corps, which was on the extreme

right, to be moved to the left past the whole army, to take the

place of Griffin's, and ordered the latter at the same time to

move by and place itself on the right.  The object of this

movement was to get the 6th corps, Wright's, next to the

cavalry, with which they had formerly served so harmoniously and

so efficiently in the valley of Virginia.



The 6th corps now remained with the cavalry and under Sheridan's

direct command until after the surrender.



Ord had been directed to take possession of all the roads

southward between Burkesville and the High Bridge.  On the

morning of the 6th he sent Colonel Washburn with two infantry

regiments with instructions to destroy High Bridge and to return

rapidly to Burkesville Station; and he prepared himself to resist

the enemy there.  Soon after Washburn had started Ord became a

little alarmed as to his safety and sent Colonel Read, of his

staff, with about eighty cavalrymen, to overtake him and bring

him back.  Very shortly after this he heard that the head of

Lee's column had got up to the road between him and where

Washburn now was, and attempted to send reinforcements, but the

reinforcements could not get through.  Read, however, had got

through ahead of the enemy.  He rode on to Farmville and was on

his way back again when he found his return cut off, and

Washburn confronting apparently the advance of Lee's army.  Read

drew his men up into line of battle, his force now consisting of

less than six hundred men, infantry and cavalry, and rode along

their front, making a speech to his men to inspire them with the

same enthusiasm that he himself felt.  He then gave the order to

charge.  This little band made several charges, of course

unsuccessful ones, but inflicted a loss upon the enemy more than

equal to their own entire number.  Colonel Read fell mortally

wounded, and then Washburn; and at the close of the conflict

nearly every officer of the command and most of the rank and

file had been either killed or wounded.  The remainder then

surrendered.  The Confederates took this to be only the advance

of a larger column which had headed them off, and so stopped to

intrench; so that this gallant band of six hundred had checked

the progress of a strong detachment of the Confederate army.



This stoppage of Lee's column no doubt saved to us the trains

following.  Lee himself pushed on and crossed the wagon road

bridge near the High Bridge, and attempted to destroy it.  He

did set fire to it, but the flames had made but little headway

when Humphreys came up with his corps and drove away the

rear-guard which had been left to protect it while it was being

burned up.  Humphreys forced his way across with some loss, and

followed Lee to the intersection of the road crossing at

Farmville with the one from Petersburg.  Here Lee held a

position which was very strong, naturally, besides being

intrenched.  Humphreys was alone, confronting him all through

the day, and in a very hazardous position.  He put on a bold

face, however, and assaulted with some loss, but was not

assaulted in return.



Our cavalry had gone farther south by the way of Prince Edward's

Court House, along with the 5th corps (Griffin's), Ord falling in

between Griffin and the Appomattox.  Crook's division of cavalry

and Wright's corps pushed on west of Farmville.  When the

cavalry reached Farmville they found that some of the

Confederates were in ahead of them, and had already got their

trains of provisions back to that point; but our troops were in

time to prevent them from securing anything to eat, although

they succeeded in again running the trains off, so that we did

not get them for some time.  These troops retreated to the north

side of the Appomattox to join Lee, and succeeded in destroying

the bridge after them.  Considerable fighting ensued there

between Wright's corps and a portion of our cavalry and the

Confederates, but finally the cavalry forded the stream and

drove them away.  Wright built a foot-bridge for his men to

march over on and then marched out to the junction of the roads

to relieve Humphreys, arriving there that night.  I had stopped

the night before at Burkesville Junction.  Our troops were then

pretty much all out of the place, but we had a field hospital

there, and Ord's command was extended from that point towards

Farmville.



Here I met Dr. Smith, a Virginian and an officer of the regular

army, who told me that in a conversation with General Ewell, one

of the prisoners and a relative of his, Ewell had said that when

we had got across the James River he knew their cause was lost,

and it was the duty of their authorities to make the best terms

they could while they still had a right to claim concessions.

The authorities thought differently, however.  Now the cause was

lost and they had no right to claim anything.  He said further,

that for every man that was killed after this in the war

somebody is responsible, and it would be but very little better

than murder.  He was not sure that Lee would consent to

surrender his army without being able to consult with the

President, but he hoped he would.



I rode in to Farmville on the 7th, arriving there early in the

day.  Sheridan and Ord were pushing through, away to the

south.  Meade was back towards the High Bridge, and Humphreys

confronting Lee as before stated.  After having gone into

bivouac at Prince Edward's Court House, Sheridan learned that

seven trains of provisions and forage were at Appomattox, and

determined to start at once and capture them; and a forced march

was necessary in order to get there before Lee's army could

secure them.  He wrote me a note telling me this.  This fact,

together with the incident related the night before by Dr.

Smith, gave me the idea of opening correspondence with General

Lee on the subject of the surrender of his army.  I therefore

wrote to him on this day, as follows:





HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE U. S.,

5 P.M., April 7, 1865.



GENERAL R. E. LEE

Commanding C. S. A.



The result of the last week must convince you of the

hopelessness of further resistance on the part of the Army of

Northern Virginia in this struggle.  I feel that it is so, and

regard it as my duty to shift from myself the responsibility of

any further effusion of blood, by asking of you the surrender of

that portion of the Confederate States army known as the Army of

Northern Virginia.



U. S. GRANT,

Lieut.-General.





Lee replied on the evening of the same day as follows:





April 7, 1865.



GENERAL:  I have received your note of this day.  Though not

entertaining the opinion you express on the hopelessness of

further resistance on the part of the Army of Northern Virginia,

I reciprocate your desire to avoid useless effusion of blood, and

therefore before considering your proposition, ask the terms you

will offer on condition of its surrender.



R. E. LEE,

General.



LIEUT.-GENERAL U. S. GRANT,

Commanding Armies of the U. S.





This was not satisfactory, but I regarded it as deserving

another letter and wrote him as follows:





April 8, 1865.



GENERAL R. E. LEE,

Commanding C. S. A.



Your note of last evening in reply to mine of same date, asking

the condition on which I will accept the surrender of the Army

of Northern Virginia is just received.  In reply I would say

that, peace being my great desire, there is but one condition I

would insist upon, namely:  that the men and officers

surrendered shall be disqualified for taking up arms again

against the Government of the United States until properly

exchanged.  I will meet you, or will designate officers to meet

any officers you may name for the same purpose, at any point

agreeable to you, for the purpose of arranging definitely the

terms upon which the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia

will be received.



U. S. GRANT,

Lieut.-General.





Lee's army was rapidly crumbling.  Many of his soldiers had

enlisted from that part of the State where they now were, and

were continually dropping out of the ranks and going to their

homes.  I know that I occupied a hotel almost destitute of

furniture at Farmville, which had probably been used as a

Confederate hospital.  The next morning when I came out I found

a Confederate colonel there, who reported to me and said that he

was the proprietor of that house, and that he was a colonel of a

regiment that had been raised in that neighborhood.  He said

that when he came along past home, he found that he was the only

man of the regiment remaining with Lee's army, so he just dropped

out, and now wanted to surrender himself.  I told him to stay

there and he would not be molested.  That was one regiment which

had been eliminated from Lee's force by this crumbling process.



Although Sheridan had been marching all day, his troops moved

with alacrity and without any straggling.  They began to see the

end of what they had been fighting four years for.  Nothing

seemed to fatigue them.  They were ready to move without rations

and travel without rest until the end.  Straggling had entirely

ceased, and every man was now a rival for the front.  The

infantry marched about as rapidly as the cavalry could.



Sheridan sent Custer with his division to move south of

Appomattox Station, which is about five miles south-west of the

Court House, to get west of the trains and destroy the roads to

the rear.  They got there the night of the 8th, and succeeded

partially; but some of the train men had just discovered the

movement of our troops and succeeded in running off three of the

trains.  The other four were held by Custer.



The head of Lee's column came marching up there on the morning

of the 9th, not dreaming, I suppose, that there were any Union

soldiers near.  The Confederates were surprised to find our

cavalry had possession of the trains.  However, they were

desperate and at once assaulted, hoping to recover them.  In the

melee that ensued they succeeded in burning one of the trains,

but not in getting anything from it.  Custer then ordered the

other trains run back on the road towards Farmville, and the

fight continued.



So far, only our cavalry and the advance of Lee's army were

engaged.  Soon, however, Lee's men were brought up from the

rear, no doubt expecting they had nothing to meet but our

cavalry.  But our infantry had pushed forward so rapidly that by

the time the enemy got up they found Griffin's corps and the Army

of the James confronting them.  A sharp engagement ensued, but

Lee quickly set up a white flag.
