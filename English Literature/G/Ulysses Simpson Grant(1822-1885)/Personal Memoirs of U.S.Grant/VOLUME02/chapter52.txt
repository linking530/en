BATTLE OF SPOTTSYLVANIA--HANCOCK'S POSITION--ASSAULT OF WARREN'S

AND WRIGHT'S CORPS--UPTON PROMOTED ON THE FIELD--GOOD NEWS FROM

BUTLER AND SHERIDAN.



The Mattapony River is formed by the junction of the Mat, the

Ta, the Po and the Ny rivers, the last being the northernmost of

the four.  It takes its rise about a mile south and a little east

of the Wilderness Tavern.  The Po rises south-west of the place,

but farther away.  Spottsylvania is on the ridge dividing these

two streams, and where they are but a few miles apart.  The

Brock Road reaches Spottsylvania without crossing either of

these streams. Lee's army coming up by the Catharpin Road, had

to cross the Po at Wooden Bridge.  Warren and Hancock came by

the Brock Road.  Sedgwick crossed the Ny at Catharpin Furnace.

Burnside coming by Aldrich's to Gates's house, had to cross the

Ny near the enemy.  He found pickets at the bridge, but they

were soon driven off by a brigade of Willcox's division, and the

stream was crossed.  This brigade was furiously attacked; but the

remainder of the division coming up, they were enabled to hold

their position, and soon fortified it.



About the time I received the news of this attack, word came

from Hancock that Early had left his front.  He had been forced

over to the Catharpin Road, crossing the Po at Corbin's and

again at Wooden Bridge.  These are the bridges Sheridan had

given orders to his cavalry to occupy on the 8th, while one

division should occupy Spottsylvania.  These movements of the

enemy gave me the idea that Lee was about to make the attempt to

get to, or towards, Fredericksburg to cut off my supplies.  I

made arrangements to attack his right and get between him and

Richmond if he should try to execute this design.  If he had any

such intention it was abandoned as soon as Burnside was

established south of the Ny.



The Po and the Ny are narrow little streams, but deep, with

abrupt banks, and bordered by heavily wooded and marshy

bottoms--at the time we were there--and difficult to cross

except where bridged.  The country about was generally heavily

timbered, but with occasional clearings.  It was a much better

country to conduct a defensive campaign in than an offensive one.



By noon of the 9th the position of the two armies was as

follows:  Lee occupied a semicircle facing north, north-west and

north-east, inclosing the town.  Anderson was on his left

extending to the Po, Ewell came next, then Early.  Warren

occupied our right, covering the Brock and other roads

converging at Spottsylvania; Sedgwick was to his left and

Burnside on our extreme left.  Hancock was yet back at Todd's

Tavern, but as soon as it was known that Early had left

Hancock's front the latter was ordered up to Warren's right.  He

formed a line with three divisions on the hill overlooking the Po

early in the afternoon, and was ordered to cross the Po and get

on the enemy's flank.  The fourth division of Hancock's corps,

Mott commanding, was left at Todd's when the corps first came

up; but in the afternoon it was brought up and placed to the

left of Sedgwick's--now Wright's--6th corps.  In the morning

General Sedgwick had been killed near the right of his

intrenchments by rebel sharpshooters.  His loss was a severe one

to the Army of the Potomac and to the Nation.  General H. G.

Wright succeeded him in the command of his corps.



Hancock was now, nine P.M. of the 9th of May, across the left

flank of Lee's army, but separated from it, and also from the

remainder of Meade's army, by the Po River.  But for the

lateness of the, hour and the darkness of the night he would

have attempted to cross the river again at Wooden Bridge, thus

bringing himself on the same side with both friend and foe.



The Po at the points where Hancock's corps crossed runs nearly

due east. just below his lower crossing--the troops crossed at

three points--it turns due south. and after passing under Wooden

Bridge soon resumes a more easterly direction.  During the night

this corps built three bridges over the Po; but these were in

rear.



The position assumed by Hancock's corps forced Lee to reinforce

his left during the night.  Accordingly on the morning of the

10th, when Hancock renewed his effort to get over the Po to his

front, he found himself confronted by some of Early's command,

which had been brought from the extreme right of the enemy

during the night.  He succeeded in effecting a crossing with one

brigade, however, but finding the enemy intrenched in his front,

no more were crossed.



Hancock reconnoitred his front on the morning of the 10th, with

the view of forcing a crossing, if it was found that an

advantage could be gained.  The enemy was found strongly

intrenched on the high ground overlooking the river, and

commanding the Wooden Bridge with artillery.  Anderson's left

rested on the Po, where it turns south; therefore, for Hancock

to cross over--although it would bring him to the same side of

the stream with the rest of the army--would still farther

isolate him from it.  The stream would have to be crossed twice

in the face of the enemy to unite with the main body.  The idea

of crossing was therefore abandoned.



Lee had weakened the other parts of his line to meet this

movement of Hancock's, and I determined to take advantage of

it.  Accordingly in the morning, orders were issued for an

attack in the afternoon on the centre by Warren's and Wright's

corps, Hancock to command all the attacking force.  Two of his

divisions were brought to the north side of the Po.  Gibbon was

placed to the right of Warren, and Birney in his rear as a

reserve.  Barlow's division was left south of the stream, and

Mott of the same corps was still to the left of Wright's

corps.  Burnside was ordered to reconnoitre his front in force,

and, if an opportunity presented, to attack with vigor.  The

enemy seeing Barlow's division isolated from the rest of the

army, came out and attacked with fury.  Barlow repulsed the

assault with great slaughter, and with considerable loss to

himself.  But the enemy reorganized and renewed the assault.

Birney was now moved to the high ground overlooking the river

crossings built by our troops, and covered the crossings.  The

second assault was repulsed, again with severe loss to the

enemy, and Barlow was withdrawn without further molestation.

General T. G. Stevenson was killed in this move.



Between the lines, where Warren's assault was to take place,

there was a ravine grown up with large trees and underbrush,

making it almost impenetrable by man.  The slopes on both sides

were also covered with a heavy growth of timber.  Warren, before

noon, reconnoitred his front twice, the first time with one and

the second with two divisions.  He was repulsed on both

occasions, but gained such information of the ground as to

induce him to report recommending the assault.



Wright also reconnoitred his front and gained a considerably

advanced position from the one he started from.  He then

organized a storming party, consisting of twelve regiments, and

assigned Colonel Emory Upton, of the 121st New York Volunteers,

to the command of it.  About four o'clock in the afternoon the

assault was ordered, Warren's and Wright's corps, with Mott's

division of Hancock's corps, to move simultaneously.  The

movement was prompt, and in a few minutes the fiercest of

struggles began.  The battle-field was so densely covered with

forest that but little could be seen, by any one person, as to

the progress made.  Meade and I occupied the best position we

could get, in rear of Warren.



Warren was repulsed with heavy loss, General J. C. Rice being

among the killed.  He was not followed, however, by the enemy,

and was thereby enabled to reorganize his command as soon as

covered from the guns of the enemy.  To the left our success was

decided, but the advantage was lost by the feeble action of

Mott.  Upton with his assaulting party pushed forward and

crossed the enemy's intrenchments.  Turning to the right and

left he captured several guns and some hundreds of prisoners.

Mott was ordered to his assistance but failed utterly.  So much

time was lost in trying to get up the troops which were in the

right position to reinforce, that I ordered Upton to withdraw;

but the officers and men of his command were so averse to giving

up the advantage they had gained that I withdrew the order.  To

relieve them, I ordered a renewal of the assault.  By this time

Hancock, who had gone with Birney's division to relieve Barlow,

had returned, bringing the division with him.  His corps was now

joined with Warren's and Wright's in this last assault.  It was

gallantly made, many men getting up to, and over, the works of

the enemy; but they were not able to hold them.  At night they

were withdrawn.  Upton brought his prisoners with him, but the

guns he had captured he was obliged to abandon.  Upton had

gained an important advantage, but a lack in others of the

spirit and dash possessed by him lost it to us.  Before leaving

Washington I had been authorized to promote officers on the

field for special acts of gallantry.  By this authority I

conferred the rank of brigadier-general upon Upton on the spot,

and this act was confirmed by the President.  Upton had been

badly wounded in this fight.



Burnside on the left had got up to within a few hundred yards of

Spottsylvania Court House, completely turning Lee's right.  He

was not aware of the importance of the advantage he had gained,

and I, being with the troops where the heavy fighting was, did

not know of it at the time.  He had gained his position with but

little fighting, and almost without loss.  Burnside's position

now separated him widely from Wright's corps, the corps nearest

to him.  At night he was ordered to join on to this.  This

brought him back about a mile, and lost to us an important

advantage.  I attach no blame to Burnside for this, but I do to

myself for not having had a staff officer with him to report to

me his position.



The enemy had not dared to come out of his line at any point to

follow up his advantage, except in the single instance of his

attack on Barlow.  Then he was twice repulsed with heavy loss,

though he had an entire corps against two brigades.  Barlow took

up his bridges in the presence of this force.



On the 11th there was no battle and but little firing; none

except by Mott who made a reconnoissance to ascertain if there

was a weak point in the enemy's line.



I wrote the following letter to General Halleck:





NEAR SPOTTSYLVANIA C. H.,

May 11, 1864--8.3O A.M.



MAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK, Chief of Staff of the Army, Washington,

D. C.



We have now ended the 6th day of very hard fighting.  The result

up to this time is much in our favor.  But our losses have been

heavy as well as those of the enemy.  We have lost to this time

eleven general officers killed, wounded and missing, and

probably twenty thousand men.  I think the loss of the enemy

must be greater--we having taken over four thousand prisoners in

battle, whilst he has taken from us but few except a few

stragglers.  I am now sending back to Belle Plain all my wagons

for a fresh supply of provisions and ammunition, and purpose to

fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.



The arrival of reinforcements here will be very encouraging to

the men, and I hope they will be sent as fast as possible, and

in as great numbers.  My object in having them sent to Belle

Plain was to use them as an escort to our supply trains.  If it

is more convenient to send them out by train to march from the

railroad to Belle Plain or Fredericksburg, send them so.



I am satisfied the enemy are very shaky, and are only kept up to

the mark by the greatest exertions on the part of their officers,

and by keeping them intrenched in every position they take.



Up to this time there is no indication of any portion of Lee's

army being detached for the defence of Richmond.



U. S. GRANT,

Lieut.-General.





And also, I received information, through the War Department,

from General Butler that his cavalry under Kautz had cut the

railroad south of Petersburg, separating Beauregard from

Richmond, and had whipped Hill, killing, wounding and capturing

many.  Also that he was intrenched, and could maintain

himself.  On this same day came news from Sheridan to the effect

that he had destroyed ten miles of the railroad and telegraph

between Lee and Richmond, one and a half million rations, and

most of the medical stores for his army.



On the 8th I had directed Sheridan verbally to cut loose from

the Army of the Potomac and pass around the left of Lee's army

and attack his cavalry and communications, which was

successfully executed in the manner I have already described.
