MORALE OF THE TWO ARMIES--RELATIVE CONDITIONS OF THE NORTH AND

SOUTH--PRESIDENT LINCOLN VISITS RICHMOND--ARRIVAL AT

WASHINGTON--PRESIDENT LINCOLN'S ASSASSINATION--PRESIDENT

JOHNSON'S POLICY.



After the fall of Petersburg, and when the armies of the Potomac

and the James were in motion to head off Lee's army, the morale

of the National troops had greatly improved.  There was no more

straggling, no more rear guards.  The men who in former times

had been falling back, were now, as I have already stated,

striving to get to the front.  For the first time in four weary

years they felt that they were now nearing the time when they

could return to their homes with their country saved.  On the

other hand, the Confederates were more than correspondingly

depressed.  Their despondency increased with each returning day,

and especially after the battle of Sailor's Creek.  They threw

away their arms in constantly increasing numbers, dropping out

of the ranks and betaking themselves to the woods in the hope of

reaching their homes.  I have already instanced the case of the

entire disintegration of a regiment whose colonel I met at

Farmville.  As a result of these and other influences, when Lee

finally surrendered at Appomattox, there were only 28,356

officers and men left to be paroled, and many of these were

without arms.  It was probably this latter fact which gave rise

to the statement sometimes made, North and South, that Lee

surrendered a smaller number of men than what the official

figures show.  As a matter of official record, and in addition

to the number paroled as given above, we captured between March

29th and the date of surrender 19,132 Confederates, to say

nothing of Lee's other losses, killed, wounded and missing,

during the series of desperate conflicts which marked his

headlong and determined flight.  The same record shows the

number of cannon, including those at Appomattox, to have been

689 between the dates named.



There has always been a great conflict of opinion as to the

number of troops engaged in every battle, or all important

battles, fought between the sections, the South magnifying the

number of Union troops engaged and belittling their own.

Northern writers have fallen, in many instances, into the same

error.  I have often heard gentlemen, who were thoroughly loyal

to the Union, speak of what a splendid fight the South had made

and successfully continued for four years before yielding, with

their twelve million of people against our twenty, and of the

twelve four being colored slaves, non-combatants.  I will add to

their argument.  We had many regiments of brave and loyal men who

volunteered under great difficulty from the twelve million

belonging to the South.



But the South had rebelled against the National government.  It

was not bound by any constitutional restrictions.  The whole

South was a military camp.  The occupation of the colored people

was to furnish supplies for the army.  Conscription was resorted

to early, and embraced every male from the age of eighteen to

forty-five, excluding only those physically unfit to serve in

the field, and the necessary number of civil officers of State

and intended National government.  The old and physically

disabled furnished a good portion of these.  The slaves, the

non-combatants, one-third of the whole, were required to work in

the field without regard to sex, and almost without regard to

age.  Children from the age of eight years could and did handle

the hoe; they were not much older when they began to hold the

plough.  The four million of colored non-combatants were equal

to more than three times their number in the North, age for age

and sex for sex, in supplying food from the soil to support

armies.  Women did not work in the fields in the North, and

children attended school.



The arts of peace were carried on in the North.  Towns and

cities grew during the war.  Inventions were made in all kinds

of machinery to increase the products of a day's labor in the

shop, and in the field.  In the South no opposition was allowed

to the government which had been set up and which would have

become real and respected if the rebellion had been

successful.  No rear had to be protected.  All the troops in

service could be brought to the front to contest every inch of

ground threatened with invasion.  The press of the South, like

the people who remained at home, were loyal to the Southern

cause.



In the North, the country, the towns and the cities presented

about the same appearance they do in time of peace.  The furnace

was in blast, the shops were filled with workmen, the fields were

cultivated, not only to supply the population of the North and

the troops invading the South, but to ship abroad to pay a part

of the expense of the war.  In the North the press was free up

to the point of open treason.  The citizen could entertain his

views and express them.  Troops were necessary in the Northern

States to prevent prisoners from the Southern army being

released by outside force, armed and set at large to destroy by

fire our Northern cities.  Plans were formed by Northern and

Southern citizens to burn our cities, to poison the water

supplying them, to spread infection by importing clothing from

infected regions, to blow up our river and lake steamers

--regardless of the destruction of innocent lives.  The

copperhead disreputable portion of the press magnified rebel

successes, and belittled those of the Union army.  It was, with

a large following, an auxiliary to the Confederate army.  The

North would have been much stronger with a hundred thousand of

these men in the Confederate ranks and the rest of their kind

thoroughly subdued, as the Union sentiment was in the South,

than we were as the battle was fought.



As I have said, the whole South was a military camp.  The

colored people, four million in number, were submissive, and

worked in the field and took care of the families while the

able-bodied white men were at the front fighting for a cause

destined to defeat.  The cause was popular, and was

enthusiastically supported by the young men.  The conscription

took all of them.  Before the war was over, further

conscriptions took those between fourteen and eighteen years of

age as junior reserves, and those between forty-five and sixty

as senior reserves.  It would have been an offence, directly

after the war, and perhaps it would be now, to ask any

able-bodied man in the South, who was between the ages of

fourteen and sixty at any time during the war, whether he had

been in the Confederate army.  He would assert that he had, or

account for his absence from the ranks.  Under such

circumstances it is hard to conceive how the North showed such a

superiority of force in every battle fought.  I know they did

not.



During 1862 and '3, John H. Morgan, a partisan officer, of no

military education, but possessed of courage and endurance,

operated in the rear of the Army of the Ohio in Kentucky and

Tennessee.  He had no base of supplies to protect, but was at

home wherever he went.  The army operating against the South, on

the contrary, had to protect its lines of communication with the

North, from which all supplies had to come to the front.  Every

foot of road had to be guarded by troops stationed at convenient

distances apart.  These guards could not render assistance beyond

the points where stationed.  Morgan Was foot-loose and could

operate where, his information--always correct--led him to

believe he could do the greatest damage.  During the time he was

operating in this way he killed, wounded and captured several

times the number he ever had under his command at any one

time.  He destroyed many millions of property in addition.

Places he did not attack had to be guarded as if threatened by

him.  Forrest, an abler soldier, operated farther west, and held

from the National front quite as many men as could be spared for

offensive operations.  It is safe to say that more than half the

National army was engaged in guarding lines of supplies, or were

on leave, sick in hospital or on detail which prevented their

bearing arms.  Then, again, large forces were employed where no

Confederate army confronted them.  I deem it safe to say that

there were no large engagements where the National numbers

compensated for the advantage of position and intrenchment

occupied by the enemy.



While I was in pursuit of General Lee, the President went to

Richmond in company with Admiral Porter, and on board his

flagship.  He found the people of that city in great

consternation.  The leading citizens among the people who had

remained at home surrounded him, anxious that something should

be done to relieve them from suspense.  General Weitzel was not

then in the city, having taken offices in one of the neighboring

villages after his troops had succeeded in subduing the

conflagration which they had found in progress on entering the

Confederate capital.  The President sent for him, and, on his

arrival, a short interview was had on board the vessel, Admiral

Porter and a leading citizen of Virginia being also present.

After this interview the President wrote an order in about these

words, which I quote from memory:  "General Weitzel is authorized

to permit the body calling itself the Legislature of Virginia to

meet for the purpose of recalling the Virginia troops from the

Confederate armies."



Immediately some of the gentlemen composing that body wrote out

a call for a meeting and had it published in their papers.  This

call, however, went very much further than Mr. Lincoln had

contemplated, as he did not say the "Legislature of Virginia"

but "the body which called itself the Legislature of Virginia."

Mr. Stanton saw the call as published in the Northern papers the

very next issue and took the liberty of countermanding the order

authorizing any meeting of the Legislature, or any other body,

and this notwithstanding the fact that the President was nearer

the spot than he was.



This was characteristic of Mr. Stanton.  He was a man who never

questioned his own authority, and who always did in war time

what he wanted to do.  He was an able constitutional lawyer and

jurist; but the Constitution was not an impediment to him while

the war lasted.  In this latter particular I entirely agree with

the view he evidently held.  The Constitution was not framed with

a view to any such rebellion as that of 1861-5.  While it did not

authorize rebellion it made no provision against it.  Yet the

right to resist or suppress rebellion is as inherent as the

right of self-defence, and as natural as the right of an

individual to preserve his life when in jeopardy.  The

Constitution was therefore in abeyance for the time being, so

far as it in any way affected the progress and termination of

the war.



Those in rebellion against the government of the United States

were not restricted by constitutional provisions, or any other,

except the acts of their Congress, which was loyal and devoted

to the cause for which the South was then fighting.  It would be

a hard case when one-third of a nation, united in rebellion

against the national authority, is entirely untrammeled, that

the other two-thirds, in their efforts to maintain the Union

intact, should be restrained by a Constitution prepared by our

ancestors for the express purpose of insuring the permanency of

the confederation of the States.



After I left General Lee at Appomattox Station, I went with my

staff and a few others directly to Burkesville Station on my way

to Washington.  The road from Burkesville back having been newly

repaired and the ground being soft, the train got off the track

frequently, and, as a result, it was after midnight of the

second day when I reached City Point.  As soon as possible I

took a dispatch-boat thence to Washington City.



While in Washington I was very busy for a time in preparing the

necessary orders for the new state of affairs ; communicating

with my different commanders of separate departments, bodies of

troops, etc.  But by the 14th I was pretty well through with

this work, so as to be able to visit my children, who were then

in Burlington, New Jersey, attending school.  Mrs. Grant was

with me in Washington at the time, and we were invited by

President and Mrs. Lincoln to accompany them to the theatre on

the evening of that day.  I replied to the President's verbal

invitation to the effect, that if we were in the city we would

take great pleasure in accompanying them; but that I was very

anxious to get away and visit my children, and if I could get

through my work during the day I should do so.  I did get

through and started by the evening train on the 14th, sending

Mr. Lincoln word, of course, that I would not be at the theatre.



At that time the railroad to New York entered Philadelphia on

Broad Street; passengers were conveyed in ambulances to the

Delaware River, and then ferried to Camden, at which point they

took the cars again.  When I reached the ferry, on the east side

of the City of Philadelphia, I found people awaiting my arrival

there; and also dispatches informing me of the assassination of

the President and Mr. Seward, and of the probable assassination

of the Vice President, Mr. Johnson, and requesting my immediate

return.



It would be impossible for me to describe the feeling that

overcame me at the news of these assassinations, more especially

the assassination of the President.  I knew his goodness of

heart, his generosity, his yielding disposition, his desire to

have everybody happy, and above all his desire to see all the

people of the United States enter again upon the full privileges

of citizenship with equality among all.  I knew also the feeling

that Mr. Johnson had expressed in speeches and conversation

against the Southern people, and I feared that his course

towards them would be such as to repel, and make them unwilling

citizens; and if they became such they would remain so for a

long while.  I felt that reconstruction had been set back, no

telling how far.



I immediately arranged for getting a train to take me back to

Washington City; but Mrs. Grant was with me; it was after

midnight and Burlington was but an hour away.  Finding that I

could accompany her to our house and return about as soon as

they would be ready to take me from the Philadelphia station, I

went up with her and returned immediately by the same special

train.  The joy that I had witnessed among the people in the

street and in public places in Washington when I left there, had

been turned to grief; the city was in reality a city of

mourning.  I have stated what I believed then the effect of this

would be, and my judgment now is that I was right.  I believe the

South would have been saved from very much of the hardness of

feeling that was engendered by Mr. Johnson's course towards them

during the first few months of his administration.  Be this as it

may, Mr. Lincoln's assassination was particularly unfortunate for

the entire nation.



Mr. Johnson's course towards the South did engender bitterness

of feeling.  His denunciations of treason and his ever-ready

remark, "Treason is a crime and must be made odious," was

repeated to all those men of the South who came to him to get

some assurances of safety so that they might go to work at

something with the feeling that what they obtained would be

secure to them.  He uttered his denunciations with great

vehemence, and as they were accompanied with no assurances of

safety, many Southerners were driven to a point almost beyond

endurance.



The President of the United States is, in a large degree, or

ought to be, a representative of the feeling, wishes and

judgment of those over whom he presides; and the Southerners who

read the denunciations of themselves and their people must have

come to the conclusion that he uttered the sentiments of the

Northern people; whereas, as a matter of fact, but for the

assassination of Mr. Lincoln, I believe the great majority of

the Northern people, and the soldiers unanimously, would have

been in favor of a speedy reconstruction on terms that would be

the least humiliating to the people who had rebelled against

their government.  They believed, I have no doubt, as I did,

that besides being the mildest, it was also the wisest, policy.



The people who had been in rebellion must necessarily come back

into the Union, and be incorporated as an integral part of the

nation.  Naturally the nearer they were placed to an equality

with the people who had not rebelled, the more reconciled they

would feel with their old antagonists, and the better citizens

they would be from the beginning.  They surely would not make

good citizens if they felt that they had a yoke around their

necks.



I do not believe that the majority of the Northern people at

that time were in favor of negro suffrage.  They supposed that

it would naturally follow the freedom of the negro, but that

there would be a time of probation, in which the ex-slaves could

prepare themselves for the privileges of citizenship before the

full right would be conferred; but Mr. Johnson, after a complete

revolution of sentiment, seemed to regard the South not only as

an oppressed people, but as the people best entitled to

consideration of any of our citizens.  This was more than the

people who had secured to us the perpetuation of the Union were

prepared for, and they became more radical in their views.  The

Southerners had the most power in the executive branch, Mr.

Johnson having gone to their side; and with a compact South, and

such sympathy and support as they could get from the North, they

felt that they would be able to control the nation at once, and

already many of them acted as if they thought they were entitled

to do so.



Thus Mr. Johnson, fighting Congress on the one hand, and

receiving the support of the South on the other, drove Congress,

which was overwhelmingly republican, to the passing of first one

measure and then another to restrict his power.  There being a

solid South on one side that was in accord with the political

party in the North which had sympathized with the rebellion, it

finally, in the judgment of Congress and of the majority of the

legislatures of the States, became necessary to enfranchise the

negro, in all his ignorance.  In this work, I shall not discuss

the question of how far the policy of Congress in this

particular proved a wise one.  It became an absolute necessity,

however, because of the foolhardiness of the President and the

blindness of the Southern people to their own interest.  As to

myself, while strongly favoring the course that would be the

least humiliating to the people who had been in rebellion, I

gradually worked up to the point where, with the majority of the

people, I favored immediate enfranchisement.
