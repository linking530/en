FORT PILLOW--GENERAL BANKS'S EXPEDITION--COLONEL MOSBY--AN

INCIDENT OF THE WILDERNESS CAMPAIGN.



When I assumed command of all the armies the situation was about

this:  the Mississippi River was guarded from St. Louis to its

mouth; the line of the Arkansas was held, thus giving us all the

North-west north of that river.  A few points in Louisiana not

remote from the river were held by the Federal troops, as was

also the mouth of the Rio Grande.  East of the Mississippi we

held substantially all north of the Memphis and Charleston

Railroad as far east as Chattanooga, thence along the line of

the Tennessee and Holston rivers, taking in nearly all of the

State of Tennessee.  West Virginia was in our hands; and that

part of old Virginia north of the Rapidan and east of the Blue

Ridge we also held.  On the sea-coast we had Fortress Monroe and

Norfolk in Virginia; Plymouth, Washington and New Berne in North

Carolina; Beaufort, Folly and Morris islands, Hilton Head, Port

Royal and Fort Pulaski in South Carolina and Georgia;

Fernandina, St. Augustine, Key West and Pensacola in Florida.

The balance of the Southern territory, an empire in extent, was

still in the hands of the enemy.



Sherman, who had succeeded me in the command of the military

division of the Mississippi, commanded all the troops in the

territory west of the Alleghanies and north of Natchez, with a

large movable force about Chattanooga. His command was

subdivided into four departments, but the commanders all

reported to Sherman and were subject to his orders.  This

arrangement, however, insured the better protection of all lines

of communication through the acquired territory, for the reason

that these different department commanders could act promptly in

case of a sudden or unexpected raid within their respective

jurisdictions without awaiting the orders of the division

commander.



In the East the opposing forces stood in substantially the same

relations towards each other as three years before, or when the

war began; they were both between the Federal and Confederate

capitals.  It is true, footholds had been secured by us on the

sea-coast, in Virginia and North Carolina, but, beyond that, no

substantial advantage had been gained by either side.  Battles

had been fought of as great severity as had ever been known in

war, over ground from the James River and Chickahominy, near

Richmond, to Gettysburg and Chambersburg, in Pennsylvania, with

indecisive results, sometimes favorable to the National army,

sometimes to the Confederate army; but in every instance, I

believe, claimed as victories for the South by the Southern

press if not by the Southern generals.  The Northern press, as a

whole, did not discourage these claims; a portion of it always

magnified rebel success and belittled ours, while another

portion, most sincerely earnest in their desire for the

preservation of the Union and the overwhelming success of the

Federal armies, would nevertheless generally express

dissatisfaction what whatever victories were gained because they

were not more complete.



That portion of the Army of the Potomac not engaged in guarding

lines of communication was on the northern bank of the

Rapidan.  The Army of Northern Virginia confronting it on the

opposite bank of the same river, was strongly intrenched and

commanded by the acknowledged ablest general in the Confederate

army.  The country back to the James River is cut up with many

streams, generally narrow, deep, and difficult to cross except

where bridged.  The region is heavily timbered, and the roads

narrow, and very bad after the least rain.  Such an enemy was

not, of course, unprepared with adequate fortifications at

convenient intervals all the way back to Richmond, so that when

driven from one fortified position they would always have

another farther to the rear to fall back into.



To provision an army, campaigning against so formidable a foe

through such a country, from wagons alone seemed almost

impossible.  System and discipline were both essential to its

accomplishment.



The Union armies were now divided into nineteen departments,

though four of them in the West had been concentrated into a

single military division.  The Army of the Potomac was a

separate command and had no territorial limits.  There were thus

seventeen distinct commanders.  Before this time these various

armies had acted separately and independently of each other,

giving the enemy an opportunity often of depleting one command,

not pressed, to reinforce another more actively engaged.  I

determined to stop this.  To this end I regarded the Army of the

Potomac as the centre, and all west to Memphis along the line

described as our position at the time, and north of it, the

right wing; the Army of the James, under General Butler, as the

left wing, and all the troops south, as a force in rear of the

enemy.  Some of these latter were occupying positions from which

they could not render service proportionate to their numerical

strength.  All such were depleted to the minimum necessary to

hold their positions as a guard against blockade runners; where

they could not do this their positions were abandoned

altogether.  In this way ten thousand men were added to the Army

of the James from South Carolina alone, with General Gillmore in

command.  It was not contemplated that General Gillmore should

leave his department; but as most of his troops were taken,

presumably for active service, he asked to accompany them and

was permitted to do so.  Officers and soldiers on furlough, of

whom there were many thousands, were ordered to their proper

commands; concentration was the order of the day, and to have it

accomplished in time to advance at the earliest moment the roads

would permit was the problem.



As a reinforcement to the Army of the Potomac, or to act in

support of it, the 9th army corps, over twenty thousand strong,

under General Burnside, had been rendezvoused at Annapolis,

Maryland.  This was an admirable position for such a

reinforcement.  The corps could be brought at the last moment as

a reinforcement to the Army of the Potomac, or it could be thrown

on the sea-coast, south of Norfolk, in Virginia or North

Carolina, to operate against Richmond from that direction.  In

fact Burnside and the War Department both thought the 9th corps

was intended for such an expedition up to the last moment.



My general plan now was to concentrate all the force possible

against the Confederate armies in the field.  There were but two

such, as we have seen, east of the Mississippi River and facing

north.  The Army of Northern Virginia, General Robert E. Lee

commanding, was on the south bank of the Rapidan, confronting

the Army of the Potomac; the second, under General Joseph E.

Johnston, was at Dalton, Georgia, opposed to Sherman who was

still at Chattanooga. Beside these main armies the Confederates

had to guard the Shenandoah Valley, a great storehouse to feed

their armies from, and their line of communications from

Richmond to Tennessee.  Forrest, a brave and intrepid cavalry

general, was in the West with a large force; making a larger

command necessary to hold what we had gained in Middle and West

Tennessee.  We could not abandon any territory north of the line

held by the enemy because it would lay the Northern States open

to invasion.  But as the Army of the Potomac was the principal

garrison for the protection of Washington even while it was

moving on Lee, so all the forces to the west, and the Army of

the James, guarded their special trusts when advancing them from

as well as when remaining at them.  Better indeed, for they

forced the enemy to guard his own lines and resources at a

greater distance from ours, and with a greater force.  Little

expeditions could not so well be sent out to destroy a bridge or

tear up a few miles of railroad track, burn a storehouse, or

inflict other little annoyances.  Accordingly I arranged for a

simultaneous movement all along the line.  Sherman was to move

from Chattanooga, Johnston's army and Atlanta being his

objective points.(*23) Crook, commanding in West Virginia, was

to move from the mouth of the Gauley River with a cavalry force

and some artillery, the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad to be

his objective.  Either the enemy would have to keep a large

force to protect their communications, or see them destroyed and

a large amount of forage and provision, which they so much

needed, fall into our hands.  Sigel was in command in the Valley

of Virginia. He was to advance up the valley, covering the North

from an invasion through that channel as well while advancing as

by remaining near Harper's Ferry.  Every mile he advanced also

gave us possession of stores on which Lee relied.  Butler was to

advance by the James River, having Richmond and Petersburg as his

objective.



Before the advance commenced I visited Butler at Fort Monroe.

This was the first time I had ever met him.  Before giving him

any order as to the part he was to play in the approaching

campaign I invited his views.  They were very much such as I

intended to direct, and as I did direct (*24), in writing,

before leaving.



General W. F. Smith, who had been promoted to the rank of

major-general shortly after the battle of Chattanooga on my

recommendation, had not yet been confirmed.  I found a decided

prejudice against his confirmation by a majority of the Senate,

but I insisted that his services had been such that he should be

rewarded.  My wishes were now reluctantly complied with, and I

assigned him to the command of one of the corps under General

Butler.  I was not long in finding out that the objections to

Smith's promotion were well founded.



In one of my early interviews with the President I expressed my

dissatisfaction with the little that had been accomplished by

the cavalry so far in the war, and the belief that it was

capable of accomplishing much more than it had done if under a

thorough leader.  I said I wanted the very best man in the army

for that command.  Halleck was present and spoke up, saying:

"How would Sheridan do?"  I replied:  "The very man I want." 

The President said I could have anybody I wanted.  Sheridan was

telegraphed for that day, and on his arrival was assigned to the

command of the cavalry corps with the Army of the Potomac.  This

relieved General Alfred Pleasonton.  It was not a reflection on

that officer, however, for I did not know but that he had been

as efficient as any other cavalry commander.



Banks in the Department of the Gulf was ordered to assemble all

the troops he had at New Orleans in time to join in the general

move, Mobile to be his objective.



At this time I was not entirely decided as to whether I should

move the Army of the Potomac by the right flank of the enemy, or

by his left.  Each plan presented advantages. (*25)  If by his

right--my left--the Potomac, Chesapeake Bay and tributaries

would furnish us an easy hauling distance of every position the

army could occupy from the Rapidan to the James River.  But Lee

could, if he chose, detach or move his whole army north on a

line rather interior to the one I would have to take in

following.  A movement by his left--our right--would obviate

this; but all that was done would have to be done with the

supplies and ammunition we started with.  All idea of adopting

this latter plan was abandoned when he limited quantity of

supplies possible to take with us was considered.  The country

over which we would have to pass was so exhausted of all food or

forage that we would be obliged to carry everything with us.



While these preparations were going on the enemy was not

entirely idle.  In the West Forrest made a raid in West

Tennessee up to the northern border, capturing the garrison of

four or five hundred men at Union City, and followed it up by an

attack on Paducah, Kentucky, on the banks of the Ohio.  While he

was able to enter the city he failed to capture the forts or any

part of the garrison.  On the first intelligence of Forrest's

raid I telegraphed Sherman to send all his cavalry against him,

and not to let him get out of the trap he had put himself

into.  Sherman had anticipated me by sending troops against him

before he got my order.



Forrest, however, fell back rapidly, and attacked the troops at

Fort Pillow, a station for the protection of the navigation of

the Mississippi River.  The garrison consisted of a regiment of

colored troops, infantry, and a detachment of Tennessee

cavalry.  These troops fought bravely, but were overpowered.  I

will leave Forrest in his dispatches to tell what he did with

them.



"The river was dyed," he says, "with the blood of the

slaughtered for two hundred yards.  The approximate loss was

upward of five hundred killed, but few of the officers

escaping.  My loss was about twenty killed.  It is hoped that

these facts will demonstrate to the Northern people that negro

soldiers cannot cope with Southerners."  Subsequently Forrest

made a report in which he left out the part which shocks

humanity to read.



At the East, also, the rebels were busy.  I had said to Halleck

that Plymouth and Washington, North Carolina, were unnecessary

to hold.  It would be better to have the garrisons engaged there

added to Butler's command.  If success attended our arms both

places, and others too, would fall into our hands naturally.

These places had been occupied by Federal troops before I took

command of the armies, and I knew that the Executive would be

reluctant to abandon them, and therefore explained my views; but

before my views were carried out the rebels captured the garrison

at Plymouth.  I then ordered the abandonment of Washington, but

directed the holding of New Berne at all hazards.  This was

essential because New Berne was a port into which blockade

runners could enter.



General Banks had gone on an expedition up the Red River long

before my promotion to general command.  I had opposed the

movement strenuously, but acquiesced because it was the order of

my superior at the time.  By direction of Halleck I had

reinforced Banks with a corps of about ten thousand men from

Sherman's command.  This reinforcement was wanted back badly

before the forward movement commenced.  But Banks had got so far

that it seemed best that he should take Shreveport on the Red

River, and turn over the line of that river to Steele, who

commanded in Arkansas, to hold instead of the line of the

Arkansas.  Orders were given accordingly, and with the

expectation that the campaign would be ended in time for Banks

to return A. J. Smith's command to where it belonged and get

back to New Orleans himself in time to execute his part in the

general plan.  But the expedition was a failure.  Banks did not

get back in time to take part in the programme as laid down. Nor

was Smith returned until long after the movements of May, 1864,

had been begun.  The services of forty thousand veteran troops,

over and above the number required to hold all that was

necessary in the Department of the Gulf, were thus paralyzed. It

is but just to Banks, however, to say that his expedition was

ordered from Washington and he was in no way responsible except

for the conduct of it.  I make no criticism on this point.  He

opposed the expedition.



By the 27th of April spring had so far advanced as to justify me

in fixing a day for the great move.  On that day Burnside left

Annapolis to occupy Meade's position between Bull Run and the

Rappahannock.  Meade was notified and directed to bring his

troops forward to his advance.  On the following day Butler was

notified of my intended advance on the 4th of May, and he was

directed to move the night of the same day and get as far up the

James River as possible by daylight, and push on from there to

accomplish the task given him.  He was also notified that

reinforcements were being collected in Washington City, which

would be forwarded to him should the enemy fall back into the

trenches at Richmond.  The same day Sherman was directed to get

his forces up ready to advance on the 5th.  Sigel was in

Winchester and was notified to move in conjunction with the

others.



The criticism has been made by writers on the campaign from the

Rapidan to the James River that all the loss of life could have

been obviated by moving the army there on transports.  Richmond

was fortified and intrenched so perfectly that one man inside to

defend was more than equal to five outside besieging or

assaulting.  To get possession of Lee's army was the first great

object.  With the capture of his army Richmond would necessarily

follow.  It was better to fight him outside of his stronghold

than in it.  If the Army of the Potomac had been moved bodily to

the James River by water Lee could have moved a part of his

forces back to Richmond, called Beauregard from the south to

reinforce it, and with the balance moved on to Washington. Then,

too, I ordered a move, simultaneous with that of the Army of the

Potomac, up the James River by a formidable army already

collected at the mouth of the river.



While my headquarters were at Culpeper, from the 26th of March

to the 4th of May, I generally visited Washington once a week to

confer with the Secretary of War and President.  On the last

occasion, a few days before moving, a circumstance occurred

which came near postponing my part in the campaign altogether.

Colonel John S. Mosby had for a long time been commanding a

partisan corps, or regiment, which operated in the rear of the

Army of the Potomac.  On my return to the field on this

occasion, as the train approached Warrenton Junction, a heavy

cloud of dust was seen to the east of the road as if made by a

body of cavalry on a charge.  Arriving at the junction the train

was stopped and inquiries made as to the cause of the dust. There

was but one man at the station, and he informed us that Mosby had

crossed a few minutes before at full speed in pursuit of Federal

cavalry.  Had he seen our train coming, no doubt he would have

let his prisoners escape to capture the train.  I was on a

special train, if I remember correctly, without any guard.



Since the close of the war I have come to know Colonel Mosby

personally, and somewhat intimately.  He is a different man

entirely from what I had supposed.  He is slender, not tall,

wiry, and looks as if he could endure any amount of physical

exercise.  He is able, and thoroughly honest and truthful. There

were probably but few men in the South who could have commanded

successfully a separate detachment in the rear of an opposing

army, and so near the border of hostilities, as long as he did

without losing his entire command.



On this same visit to Washington I had my last interview with

the President before reaching the James River.  He had of course

become acquainted with the fact that a general movement had been

ordered all along the line, and seemed to think it a new feature

in war.  I explained to him that it was necessary to have a great

number of troops to guard and hold the territory we had captured,

and to prevent incursions into the Northern States.  These troops

could perform this service just as well by advancing as by

remaining still; and by advancing they would compel the enemy to

keep detachments to hold them back, or else lay his own territory

open to invasion.  His answer was:  "Oh, yes!  I see that.  As we

say out West, if a man can't skin he must hold a leg while

somebody else does."



There was a certain incident connected with the Wilderness

campaign of which it may not be out of place to speak; and to

avoid a digression further on I will mention it here.



A few days before my departure from Culpeper the Honorable E. B.

Washburne visited me there, and remained with my headquarters for

some distance south, through the battle in the Wilderness and, I

think, to Spottsylvania. He was accompanied by a Mr. Swinton,

whom he presented as a literary gentleman who wished to

accompany the army with a view of writing a history of the war

when it was over.  He assured me--and I have no doubt Swinton

gave him the assurance--that he was not present as a

correspondent of the press.  I expressed an entire willingness

to have him (Swinton) accompany the army, and would have allowed

him to do so as a correspondent, restricted, however, in the

character of the information he could give.  We received

Richmond papers with about as much regularity as if there had

been no war, and knew that our papers were received with equal

regularity by the Confederates.  It was desirable, therefore,

that correspondents should not be privileged spies of the enemy

within our lines.



Probably Mr. Swinton expected to be an invited guest at my

headquarters, and was disappointed that he was not asked to

become so.  At all events he was not invited, and soon I found

that he was corresponding with some paper (I have now forgotten

which one), thus violating his word either expressed or

implied.  He knew of the assurance Washburne had given as to the

character of his mission.  I never saw the man from the day of

our introduction to the present that I recollect.  He

accompanied us, however, for a time at least.



The second night after crossing the Rapidan (the night of the

5th of May) Colonel W. R. Rowley, of my staff, was acting as

night officer at my headquarters.  A short time before midnight

I gave him verbal instructions for the night.  Three days later

I read in a Richmond paper a verbatim report of these

instructions.



A few nights still later (after the first, and possibly after

the second, day's fighting in the Wilderness) General Meade came

to my tent for consultation, bringing with him some of his staff

officers.  Both his staff and mine retired to the camp-fire some

yards in front of the tent, thinking our conversation should be

private.  There was a stump a little to one side, and between

the front of the tent and camp-fire.  One of my staff, Colonel

T. S. Bowers, saw what he took to be a man seated on the ground

and leaning against the stump, listening to the conversation

between Meade and myself.  He called the attention of Colonel

Rowley to it.  The latter immediately took the man by the

shoulder and asked him, in language more forcible than polite,

what he was doing there.  The man proved to be Swinton, the

"historian," and his replies to the question were evasive and

unsatisfactory, and he was warned against further eaves-dropping.



The next I heard of Mr. Swinton was at Cold Harbor.  General

Meade came to my headquarters saying that General Burnside had

arrested Swinton, who at some previous time had given great

offence, and had ordered him to be shot that afternoon.  I

promptly ordered the prisoner to be released, but that he must

be expelled from the lines of the army not to return again on

pain of punishment.
