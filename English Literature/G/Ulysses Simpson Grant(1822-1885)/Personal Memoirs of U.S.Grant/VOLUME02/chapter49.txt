SHERMAN'S CAMPAIGN IN GEORGIA--SIEGE OF ATLANTA--DEATH OF

GENERAL MCPHERSON--ATTEMPT TO CAPTURE ANDERSONVILLE--CAPTURE OF

ATLANTA.



After separating from Sherman in Cincinnati I went on to

Washington, as already stated, while he returned to Nashville to

assume the duties of his new command.  His military division was

now composed of four departments and embraced all the territory

west of the Alleghany Mountains and east of the Mississippi

River, together with the State of Arkansas in the

trans-Mississippi.  The most easterly of these was the

Department of the Ohio, General Schofield commanding; the next

was the Department of the Cumberland, General Thomas commanding;

the third the Department of the Tennessee, General McPherson

commanding; and General Steele still commanded the

trans-Mississippi, or Department of Arkansas.  The last-named

department was so far away that Sherman could not communicate

with it very readily after starting on his spring campaign, and

it was therefore soon transferred from his military division to

that of the Gulf, where General Canby, who had relieved General

Banks, was in command.



The movements of the armies, as I have stated in a former

chapter, were to be simultaneous, I fixing the day to start when

the season should be far enough advanced, it was hoped, for the

roads to be in a condition for the troops to march.



General Sherman at once set himself to work preparing for the

task which was assigned him to accomplish in the spring

campaign.  McPherson lay at Huntsville with about twenty-four

thousand men, guarding those points of Tennessee which were

regarded as most worth holding; Thomas, with over sixty thousand

men of the Army of the Cumberland, was at Chattanooga; and

Schofield, with about fourteen thousand men, was at Knoxville.

With these three armies, numbering about one hundred thousand

men in all, Sherman was to move on the day fixed for the general

advance, with a view of destroying Johnston's army and capturing

Atlanta. He visited each of these commands to inform himself as

to their condition, and it was found to be, speaking generally,

good.



One of the first matters to turn his attention to was that of

getting, before the time arrived for starting, an accumulation

of supplies forward to Chattanooga, sufficiently large to

warrant a movement.  He found, when he got to that place, that

the trains over the single-track railroad, which was frequently

interrupted for a day or two at a time, were only sufficient to

meet the daily wants of the troops without bringing forward any

surplus of any kind.  He found, however, that trains were being

used to transport all the beef cattle, horses for the cavalry,

and even teams that were being brought to the front.  He at once

changed all this, and required beef cattle, teams, cavalry

horses, and everything that could travel, even the troops, to be

marched, and used the road exclusively for transporting

supplies.  In this way he was able to accumulate an abundance

before the time finally fixed upon for the move, the 4th of May.



As I have said already, Johnston was at Dalton, which was nearly

one-fourth of the way between Chattanooga and Atlanta. The

country is mountainous all the way to Atlanta, abounding in

mountain streams, some of them of considerable volume.  Dalton

is on ground where water drains towards Atlanta and into one of

the main streams rising north-east from there and flowing

south-west--this being the general direction which all the main

streams of that section take, with smaller tributaries entering

into them.  Johnston had been preparing himself for this

campaign during the entire winter.  The best positions for

defence had been selected all the way from Dalton back to

Atlanta, and very strongly intrenched; so that, as he might be

forced to fall back from one position, he would have another to

fall into in his rear.  His position at Dalton was so very

strongly intrenched that no doubt he expected, or at least

hoped, to hold Sherman there and prevent him from getting any

further.  With a less skilful general, and one disposed to take

no risks, I have no doubt that he would have succeeded.



Sherman's plan was to start Schofield, who was farthest back, a

few days in advance from Knoxville, having him move on the

direct road to Dalton.  Thomas was to move out to Ringgold.  It

had been Sherman's intention to cross McPherson over the

Tennessee River at Huntsville or Decatur, and move him south

from there so as to have him come into the road running from

Chattanooga to Atlanta a good distance to the rear of the point

Johnston was occupying; but when that was contemplated it was

hoped that McPherson alone would have troops enough to cope with

Johnston, if the latter should move against him while unsupported

by the balance of the army.  In this he was disappointed.  Two of

McPherson's veteran divisions had re-enlisted on the express

provision that they were to have a furlough.  This furlough had

not yet expired, and they were not back.



Then, again, Sherman had lent Banks two divisions under A. J.

Smith, the winter before, to co-operate with the

trans-Mississippi forces, and this with the express pledge that

they should be back by a time specified, so as to be prepared

for this very campaign.  It is hardly necessary to say they were

not returned.  That department continued to absorb troops to no

purpose to the end of the war.  This left McPherson so weak that

the part of the plan above indicated had to be changed.  He was

therefore brought up to Chattanooga and moved from there on a

road to the right of Thomas--the two coming together about

Dalton.  The three armies were abreast, all ready to start

promptly on time.



Sherman soon found that Dalton was so strongly fortified that it

was useless to make any attempt to carry it by assault; and even

to carry it by regular approaches was impracticable.  There was

a narrowing up in the mountain, between the National and

Confederate armies, through which a stream, a wagon road and a

railroad ran.  Besides, the stream had been dammed so that the

valley was a lake.  Through this gorge the troops would have to

pass.  McPherson was therefore sent around by the right, to come

out by the way of Snake Creek Gap into the rear of the enemy.

This was a surprise to Johnston, and about the 13th he decided

to abandon his position at Dalton.



On the 15th there was very hard fighting about Resaca; but our

cavalry having been sent around to the right got near the road

in the enemy's rear.  Again Johnston fell back, our army

pursuing.  The pursuit was continued to Kingston, which was

reached on the 19th with very little fighting, except that

Newton's division overtook the rear of Johnston's army and

engaged it.  Sherman was now obliged to halt for the purpose of

bringing up his railroad trains.  He was depending upon the

railroad for all of his supplies, and as of course the railroad

was wholly destroyed as Johnston fell back, it had to be

rebuilt.  This work was pushed forward night and day, and caused

much less delay than most persons would naturally expect in a

mountainous country where there were so many bridges to be

rebuilt.



The campaign to Atlanta was managed with the most consummate

skill, the enemy being flanked out of one position after another

all the way there.  It is true this was not accomplished without

a good deal of fighting--some of it very hard fighting, rising

to the dignity of very important battles--neither were single

positions gained in a day.  On the contrary, weeks were spent at

some; and about Atlanta more than a month was consumed.



It was the 23d of May before the road was finished up to the

rear of Sherman's army and the pursuit renewed.  This pursuit

brought him up to the vicinity of Allatoona. This place was very

strongly intrenched, and naturally a very defensible position. An

assault upon it was not thought of, but preparations were made to

flank the enemy out of it.  This was done by sending a large

force around our right, by the way of Dallas, to reach the rear

of the enemy.  Before reaching there, however, they found the

enemy fortified in their way, and there resulted hard fighting

for about a week at a place called New Hope Church.  On the left

our troops also were fortified, and as close up to the enemy as

they could get.  They kept working still farther around to the

left toward the railroad.  This was the case more particularly

with the cavalry.  By the 4th of June Johnston found that he was

being hemmed in so rapidly that he drew off and Allatoona was

left in our possession.



Allatoona, being an important place, was strongly intrenched for

occupation by our troops before advancing farther, and made a

secondary base of supplies.  The railroad was finished up to

that point, the intrenchments completed, storehouses provided

for food, and the army got in readiness for a further advance.

The rains, however, were falling in such torrents that it was

impossible to move the army by the side roads which they would

have to move upon in order to turn Johnston out of his new

position.



While Sherman's army lay here, General F. P. Blair returned to

it, bringing with him the two divisions of veterans who had been

on furlough.



Johnston had fallen back to Marietta and Kenesaw Mountain, where

strong intrenchments awaited him.  At this latter place our

troops made an assault upon the enemy's lines after having got

their own lines up close to him, and failed, sustaining

considerable loss.  But during the progress of the battle

Schofield was gaining ground to the left; and the cavalry on his

left were gaining still more toward the enemy's rear.  These

operations were completed by the 3d of July, when it was found

that Johnston had evacuated the place.  He was pursued at

once.  Sherman had made every preparation to abandon the

railroad, leaving a strong guard in his intrenchments.  He had

intended, moving out with twenty days' rations and plenty of

ammunition, to come in on the railroad again at the

Chattahoochee River.  Johnston frustrated this plan by himself

starting back as above stated.  This time he fell back to the

Chattahoochee.



About the 5th of July he was besieged again, Sherman getting

easy possession of the Chattahoochee River both above and below

him.  The enemy was again flanked out of his position, or so

frightened by flanking movements that on the night of the 9th he

fell back across the river.



Here Johnston made a stand until the 17th, when Sherman's old

tactics prevailed again and the final movement toward Atlanta

began.  Johnston was now relieved of the command, and Hood

superseded him.



Johnston's tactics in this campaign do not seem to have met with

much favor, either in the eyes of the administration at Richmond,

or of the people of that section of the South in which he was

commanding.  The very fact of a change of commanders being

ordered under such circumstances was an indication of a change

of policy, and that now they would become the aggressors--the

very thing our troops wanted.



For my own part, I think that Johnston's tactics were right.

Anything that could have prolonged the war a year beyond the

time that it did finally close, would probably have exhausted

the North to such an extent that they might then have abandoned

the contest and agreed to a separation.



Atlanta was very strongly intrenched all the way around in a

circle about a mile and a half outside of the city.  In addition

to this, there were advanced intrenchments which had to be taken

before a close siege could be commenced.



Sure enough, as indicated by the change of commanders, the enemy

was about to assume the offensive.  On the 20th he came out and

attacked the Army of the Cumberland most furiously.  Hooker's

corps, and Newton's and Johnson's divisions were the principal

ones engaged in this contest, which lasted more than an hour;

but the Confederates were then forced to fall back inside their

main lines.  The losses were quite heavy on both sides.  On this

day General Gresham, since our Postmaster-General, was very badly

wounded.  During the night Hood abandoned his outer lines, and

our troops were advanced.  The investment had not been

relinquished for a moment during the day.



During the night of the 21st Hood moved out again, passing by

our left flank, which was then in motion to get a position

farther in rear of him, and a desperate battle ensued, which

lasted most of the day of the 22d.  At first the battle went

very much in favor of the Confederates, our troops being

somewhat surprised.  While our troops were advancing they were

struck in flank, and their flank was enveloped.  But they had

become too thorough veterans to be thrown into irreparable

confusion by an unexpected attack when off their guard, and soon

they were in order and engaging the enemy, with the advantage now

of knowing where their antagonist was.  The field of battle

continued to expand until it embraced about seven miles of

ground.  Finally, however, and before night, the enemy was

driven back into the city (*26).



It was during this battle that McPherson, while passing from one

column to another, was instantly killed.  In his death the army

lost one of its ablest, purest and best generals.



Garrard had been sent out with his cavalry to get upon the

railroad east of Atlanta and to cut it in the direction of

Augusta. He was successful in this, and returned about the time

of the battle.  Rousseau had also come up from Tennessee with a

small division of cavalry, having crossed the Tennessee River

about Decatur and made a raid into Alabama. Finally, when hard

pressed, he had come in, striking the railroad in rear of

Sherman, and reported to him about this time.



The battle of the 22d is usually known as the Battle of Atlanta,

although the city did not fall into our hands until the 2d of

September.  Preparations went on, as before, to flank the enemy

out of his position.  The work was tedious, and the lines that

had to be maintained were very long.  Our troops were gradually

worked around to the east until they struck the road between

Decatur and Atlanta. These lines were strongly fortified, as

were those to the north and west of the city--all as close up to

the enemy's lines as practicable--in order to hold them with the

smallest possible number of men, the design being to detach an

army to move by our right and try to get upon the railroad down

south of Atlanta.



On the 27th the movement by the right flank commenced.  On the

28th the enemy struck our right flank, General Logan commanding,

with great vigor.  Logan intrenched himself hastily, and by that

means was enabled to resist all assaults and inflict a great

deal of damage upon the enemy.  These assaults were continued to

the middle of the afternoon, and resumed once or twice still

later in the day.  The enemy's losses in these unsuccessful

assaults were fearful.



During that evening the enemy in Logan's front withdrew into the

town.  This now left Sherman's army close up to the Confederate

lines, extending from a point directly east of the city around

by the north and west of it for a distance of fully ten miles;

the whole of this line being intrenched, and made stronger every

day they remained there.



In the latter part of July Sherman sent Stoneman to destroy the

railroads to the south, about Macon.  He was then to go east

and, if possible, release our prisoners about Andersonville.

There were painful stories current at the time about the great

hardships these prisoners had to endure in the way of general

bad treatment, in the way in which they were housed, and in the

way in which they were fed.  Great sympathy was felt for them;

and it was thought that even if they could be turned loose upon

the country it would be a great relief to them.  But the attempt

proved a failure.  McCook, who commanded a small brigade, was

first reported to have been captured; but he got back, having

inflicted a good deal of damage upon the enemy.  He had also

taken some prisoners; but encountering afterwards a largely

superior force of the enemy he was obliged to drop his prisoners

and get back as best he could with what men he had left.  He had

lost several hundred men out of his small command.  On the 4th

of August Colonel Adams, commanding a little brigade of about a

thousand men, returned reporting Stoneman and all but himself as

lost.  I myself had heard around Richmond of the capture of

Stoneman, and had sent Sherman word, which he received.  The

rumor was confirmed there, also, from other sources.  A few days

after Colonel Adams's return Colonel Capron also got in with a

small detachment and confirmed the report of the capture of

Stoneman with something less than a thousand men.



It seems that Stoneman, finding the escape of all his force was

impossible, had made arrangements for the escape of two

divisions.  He covered the movement of these divisions to the

rear with a force of about seven hundred men, and at length

surrendered himself and this detachment to the commanding

Confederate.  In this raid, however, much damage was inflicted

upon the enemy by the destruction of cars, locomotives, army

wagons, manufactories of military supplies, etc.



On the 4th and 5th Sherman endeavored to get upon the railroad

to our right, where Schofield was in command, but these attempts

failed utterly.  General Palmer was charged with being the cause

of this failure, to a great extent, by both General Sherman and

General Schofield; but I am not prepared to say this, although a

question seems to have arisen with Palmer as to whether Schofield

had any right to command him.  If he did raise this question

while an action was going on, that act alone was exceedingly

reprehensible.



About the same time Wheeler got upon our railroad north of

Resaca and destroyed it nearly up to Dalton.  This cut Sherman

off from communication with the North for several days.  Sherman

responded to this attack on his lines of communication by

directing one upon theirs.



Kilpatrick started on the night of the 18th of August to reach

the Macon road about Jonesboro.  He succeeded in doing so,

passed entirely around the Confederate lines of Atlanta, and was

back again in his former position on our left by the 22d.  These

little affairs, however, contributed but very little to the

grand result.  They annoyed, it is true, but any damage thus

done to a railroad by any cavalry expedition is soon repaired.



Sherman made preparations for a repetition of his tactics; that

is, for a flank movement with as large a force as could be got

together to some point in the enemy's rear.  Sherman commenced

this last movement on the 25th of August, and on the 1st of

September was well up towards the railroad twenty miles south of

Atlanta.  Here he found Hardee intrenched, ready to meet him.  A

battle ensued, but he was unable to drive Hardee away before

night set in.  Under cover of the night, however, Hardee left of

his own accord.  That night Hood blew up his military works, such

as he thought would be valuable in our hands, and decamped.



The next morning at daylight General H. W. Slocum, who was

commanding north of the city, moved in and took possession of

Atlanta, and notified Sherman.  Sherman then moved deliberately

back, taking three days to reach the city, and occupied a line

extending from Decatur on the left to Atlanta in the centre,

with his troops extending out of the city for some distance to

the right.



The campaign had lasted about four months, and was one of the

most memorable in history.  There was but little if anything in

the whole campaign, now that it is over, to criticise at all,

and nothing to criticise severely.  It was creditable alike to

the general who commanded and the army which had executed it.

Sherman had on this campaign some bright, wide-awake division

and brigade commanders whose alertness added a host to the

efficiency of his command.



The troops now went to work to make themselves comfortable, and

to enjoy a little rest after their arduous campaign.  The city

of Atlanta was turned into a military base.  The citizens were

all compelled to leave.  Sherman also very wisely prohibited the

assembling of the army of sutlers and traders who always follow

in the wake of an army in the field, if permitted to do so, from

trading with the citizens and getting the money of the soldiers

for articles of but little use to them, and for which they are

made to pay most exorbitant prices.  He limited the number of

these traders to one for each of his three armies.



The news of Sherman's success reached the North instantaneously,

and set the country all aglow.  This was the first great

political campaign for the Republicans in their canvass of

1864.  It was followed later by Sheridan's campaign in the

Shenandoah Valley; and these two campaigns probably had more

effect in settling the election of the following November than

all the speeches, all the bonfires, and all the parading with

banners and bands of music in the North.
