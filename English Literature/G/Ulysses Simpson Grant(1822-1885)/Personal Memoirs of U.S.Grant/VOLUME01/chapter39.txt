RETROSPECT OF THE CAMPAIGN--SHERMAN'S MOVEMENTS--PROPOSED

MOVEMENT UPON MOBILE--A PAINFUL ACCIDENT--ORDERED TO REPORT AT

CAIRO.



The capture of Vicksburg, with its garrison, ordnance and

ordnance stores, and the successful battles fought in reaching

them, gave new spirit to the loyal people of the North.  New

hopes for the final success of the cause of the Union were

inspired.  The victory gained at Gettysburg, upon the same day,

added to their hopes.  Now the Mississippi River was entirely in

the possession of the National troops; for the fall of Vicksburg

gave us Port Hudson at once.  The army of northern Virginia was

driven out of Pennsylvania and forced back to about the same

ground it occupied in 1861.  The Army of the Tennessee united

with the Army of the Gulf, dividing the Confederate States

completely.



The first dispatch I received from the government after the fall

of Vicksburg was in these words:



"I fear your paroling the prisoners at Vicksburg, without actual

delivery to a proper agent as required by the seventh article of

the cartel, may be construed into an absolute release, and that

the men will immediately be placed in the ranks of the enemy.

Such has been the case elsewhere.  If these prisoners have not

been allowed to depart, you will detain them until further

orders."



Halleck did not know that they had already been delivered into

the hands of Major Watts, Confederate commissioner for the

exchange of prisoners.



At Vicksburg 31,600 prisoners were surrendered, together with

172 cannon about 60,000 muskets and a large amount of

ammunition.  The small-arms of the enemy were far superior to

the bulk of ours.  Up to this time our troops at the West had

been limited to the old United States flint-lock muskets changed

into percussion, or the Belgian musket imported early in the

war--almost as dangerous to the person firing it as to the one

aimed at--and a few new and improved arms.  These were of many

different calibers, a fact that caused much trouble in

distributing ammunition during an engagement.  The enemy had

generally new arms which had run the blockade and were of

uniform caliber.  After the surrender I authorized all colonels

whose regiments were armed with inferior muskets, to place them

in the stack of captured arms and replace them with the

latter.  A large number of arms turned in to the Ordnance

Department as captured, were thus arms that had really been used

by the Union army in the capture of Vicksburg.



In this narrative I have not made the mention I should like of

officers, dead and alive, whose services entitle them to special

mention.  Neither have I made that mention of the navy which its

services deserve.  Suffice it to say, the close of the siege of

Vicksburg found us with an army unsurpassed, in proportion to

its numbers, taken as a whole of officers and men.  A military

education was acquired which no other school could have given.

Men who thought a company was quite enough for them to command

properly at the beginning, would have made good regimental or

brigade commanders; most of the brigade commanders were equal to

the command of a division, and one, Ransom, would have been equal

to the command of a corps at least. Logan and Crocker ended the

campaign fitted to command independent armies.



General F. P. Blair joined me at Milliken's Bend a full-fledged

general, without having served in a lower grade.  He commanded a

division in the campaign.  I had known Blair in Missouri, where I

had voted against him in 1858 when he ran for Congress.  I knew

him as a frank, positive and generous man, true to his friends

even to a fault, but always a leader.  I dreaded his coming; I

knew from experience that it was more difficult to command two

generals desiring to be leaders than it was to command one army

officered intelligently and with subordination.  It affords me

the greatest pleasure to record now my agreeable disappointment

in respect to his character.  There was no man braver than he,

nor was there any who obeyed all orders of his superior in rank

with more unquestioning alacrity.  He was one man as a soldier,

another as a politician.



The navy under Porter was all it could be, during the entire

campaign.  Without its assistance the campaign could not have

been successfully made with twice the number of men engaged.  It

could not have been made at all, in the way it was, with any

number of men without such assistance.  The most perfect harmony

reigned between the two arms of the service.  There never was a

request made, that I am aware of, either of the flag-officer or

any of his subordinates, that was not promptly complied with.



The campaign of Vicksburg was suggested and developed by

circumstances.  The elections of 1862 had gone against the

prosecution of the war.  Voluntary enlistments had nearly ceased

and the draft had been resorted to; this was resisted, and a

defeat or backward movement would have made its execution

impossible.  A forward movement to a decisive victory was

necessary.  Accordingly I resolved to get below Vicksburg, unite

with Banks against Port Hudson, make New Orleans a base and, with

that base and Grand Gulf as a starting point, move our combined

forces against Vicksburg.  Upon reaching Grand Gulf, after

running its batteries and fighting a battle, I received a letter

from Banks informing me that he could not be at Port Hudson under

ten days, and then with only fifteen thousand men.  The time was

worth more than the reinforcements; I therefore determined to

push into the interior of the enemy's country.



With a large river behind us, held above and below by the enemy,

rapid movements were essential to success.  Jackson was captured

the day after a new commander had arrived, and only a few days

before large reinforcements were expected.  A rapid movement

west was made; the garrison of Vicksburg was met in two

engagements and badly defeated, and driven back into its

stronghold and there successfully besieged.  It looks now as

though Providence had directed the course of the campaign while

the Army of the Tennessee executed the decree.



Upon the surrender of the garrison of Vicksburg there were three

things that required immediate attention.  The first was to send

a force to drive the enemy from our rear, and out of the

State.  The second was to send reinforcements to Banks near Port

Hudson, if necessary, to complete the triumph of opening the

Mississippi from its source to its mouth to the free navigation

of vessels bearing the Stars and Stripes.  The third was to

inform the authorities at Washington and the North of the good

news, to relieve their long suspense and strengthen their

confidence in the ultimate success of the cause they had so much

at heart.



Soon after negotiations were opened with General Pemberton for

the surrender of the city, I notified Sherman, whose troops

extended from Haines' Bluff on the left to the crossing of the

Vicksburg and Jackson road over the Big Black on the right, and

directed him to hold his command in readiness to advance and

drive the enemy from the State as soon as Vicksburg

surrendered.  Steele and Ord were directed to be in readiness to

join Sherman in his move against General Johnston, and Sherman

was advised of this also.  Sherman moved promptly, crossing the

Big Black at three different points with as many columns, all

concentrating at Bolton, twenty miles west of Jackson.



Johnston heard of the surrender of Vicksburg almost as soon as

it occurred, and immediately fell back on Jackson.  On the 8th

of July Sherman was within ten miles of Jackson and on the 11th

was close up to the defences of the city and shelling the

town.  The siege was kept up until the morning of the 17th, when

it was found that the enemy had evacuated during the night.  The

weather was very hot, the roads dusty and the water bad.

Johnston destroyed the roads as he passed and had so much the

start that pursuit was useless; but Sherman sent one division,

Steele's, to Brandon, fourteen miles east of Jackson.



The National loss in the second capture of Jackson was less than

one thousand men, killed, wounded and missing.  The Confederate

loss was probably less, except in captured.  More than this

number fell into our hands as prisoners.



Medicines and food were left for the Confederate wounded and

sick who had to be left behind.  A large amount of rations was

issued to the families that remained in Jackson.  Medicine and

food were also sent to Raymond for the destitute families as

well as the sick and wounded, as I thought it only fair that we

should return to these people some of the articles we had taken

while marching through the country.  I wrote to Sherman:

"Impress upon the men the importance of going through the State

in an orderly manner, abstaining from taking anything not

absolutely necessary for their subsistence while travelling.

They should try to create as favorable an impression as possible

upon the people."  Provisions and forage, when called for by

them, were issued to all the people, from Bruinsburg to Jackson

and back to Vicksburg, whose resources had been taken for the

supply of our army.  Very large quantities of groceries and

provisions were so issued.



Sherman was ordered back to Vicksburg, and his troops took much

the same position they had occupied before--from the Big Black

to Haines' Bluff.  Having cleaned up about Vicksburg and

captured or routed all regular Confederate forces for more than

a hundred miles in all directions, I felt that the troops that

had done so much should be allowed to do more before the enemy

could recover from the blow he had received, and while important

points might be captured without bloodshed.  I suggested to the

General-in-chief the idea of a campaign against Mobile, starting

from Lake Pontchartrain.  Halleck preferred another course.  The

possession of the trans-Mississippi by the Union forces seemed

to possess more importance in his mind than almost any campaign

east of the Mississippi.  I am well aware that the President was

very anxious to have a foothold in Texas, to stop the clamor of

some of the foreign governments which seemed to be seeking a

pretext to interfere in the war, at least so far as to recognize

belligerent rights to the Confederate States.  This, however,

could have been easily done without wasting troops in western

Louisiana and eastern Texas, by sending a garrison at once to

Brownsville on the Rio Grande.



Halleck disapproved of my proposition to go against Mobile, so

that I was obliged to settle down and see myself put again on

the defensive as I had been a year before in west Tennessee.  It

would have been an easy thing to capture Mobile at the time I

proposed to go there.  Having that as a base of operations,

troops could have been thrown into the interior to operate

against General Bragg's army.  This would necessarily have

compelled Bragg to detach in order to meet this fire in his

rear.  If he had not done this the troops from Mobile could have

inflicted inestimable damage upon much of the country from which

his army and Lee's were yet receiving their supplies.  I was so

much impressed with this idea that I renewed my request later in

July and again about the 1st of August, and proposed sending all

the troops necessary, asking only the assistance of the navy to

protect the debarkation of troops at or near Mobile.  I also

asked for a leave of absence to visit New Orleans, particularly

if my suggestion to move against Mobile should be approved. Both

requests were refused.  So far as my experience with General

Halleck went it was very much easier for him to refuse a favor

than to grant one.  But I did not regard this as a favor. It was

simply in line of duty, though out of my department.



The General-in-chief having decided against me, the depletion of

an army, which had won a succession of great victories,

commenced, as had been the case the year before after the fall

of Corinth when the army was sent where it would do the least

good.  By orders, I sent to Banks a force of 4,000 men; returned

the 9th corps to Kentucky and, when transportation had been

collected, started a division of 5,000 men to Schofield in

Missouri where Price was raiding the State.  I also detached a

brigade under Ransom to Natchez, to garrison that place

permanently.  This latter move was quite fortunate as to the

time when Ransom arrived there.  The enemy happened to have a

large number, about 5,000 head, of beef cattle there on the way

from Texas to feed the Eastern armies, and also a large amount

of munitions of war which had probably come through Texas from

the Rio Grande and which were on the way to Lee's and other

armies in the East.



The troops that were left with me around Vicksburg were very

busily and unpleasantly employed in making expeditions against

guerilla bands and small detachments of cavalry which infested

the interior, and in destroying mills, bridges and rolling stock

on the railroads.  The guerillas and cavalry were not there to

fight but to annoy, and therefore disappeared on the first

approach of our troops.



The country back of Vicksburg was filled with deserters from

Pemberton's army and, it was reported, many from Johnston's

also.  The men determined not to fight again while the war

lasted.  Those who lived beyond the reach of the Confederate

army wanted to get to their homes.  Those who did not, wanted to

get North where they could work for their support till the war

was over.  Besides all this there was quite a peace feeling, for

the time being, among the citizens of that part of Mississippi,

but this feeling soon subsided.  It is not probable that

Pemberton got off with over 4,000 of his army to the camp where

he proposed taking them, and these were in a demoralized

condition.



On the 7th of August I further depleted my army by sending the

13th corps, General Ord commanding, to Banks.  Besides this I

received orders to co-operate with the latter general in

movements west of the Mississippi.  Having received this order I

went to New Orleans to confer with Banks about the proposed

movement.  All these movements came to naught.



During this visit I reviewed Banks' army a short distance above

Carrollton.  The horse I rode was vicious and but little used,

and on my return to New Orleans ran away and, shying at a

locomotive in the street, fell, probably on me.  I was rendered

insensible, and when I regained consciousness I found myself in

a hotel near by with several doctors attending me.  My leg was

swollen from the knee to the thigh, and the swelling, almost to

the point of bursting, extended along the body up to the

arm-pit.  The pain was almost beyond endurance.  I lay at the

hotel something over a week without being able to turn myself in

bed.  I had a steamer stop at the nearest point possible, and was

carried to it on a litter.  I was then taken to Vicksburg, where

I remained unable to move for some time afterwards.



While I was absent General Sherman declined to assume command

because, he said, it would confuse the records; but he let all

the orders be made in my name, and was glad to render any

assistance he could.  No orders were issued by my staff,

certainly no important orders, except upon consultation with and

approval of Sherman.



On the 13th of September, while I was still in New Orleans,

Halleck telegraphed to me to send all available forces to

Memphis and thence to Tuscumbia, to co-operate with Rosecrans

for the relief of Chattanooga. On the 15th he telegraphed again

for all available forces to go to Rosecrans.  This was received

on the 27th.  I was still confined to my bed, unable to rise

from it without assistance; but I at once ordered Sherman to

send one division to Memphis as fast as transports could be

provided.  The division of McPherson's corps, which had got off

and was on the way to join Steele in Arkansas, was recalled and

sent, likewise, to report to Hurlbut at Memphis.  Hurlbut was

directed to forward these two divisions with two others from his

own corps at once, and also to send any other troops that might

be returning there.  Halleck suggested that some good man, like

Sherman or McPherson, should be sent to Memphis to take charge

of the troops going east. On this I sent Sherman, as being, I

thought, the most suitable person for an independent command,

and besides he was entitled to it if it had to be given to any

one.  He was directed to take with him another division of his

corps.  This left one back, but having one of McPherson's

divisions he had still the equivalent.



Before the receipt by me of these orders the battle of

Chickamauga had been fought and Rosecrans forced back into

Chattanooga. The administration as well as the General-in-chief

was nearly frantic at the situation of affairs there.  Mr.

Charles A. Dana, an officer of the War Department, was sent to

Rosecrans' headquarters.  I do not know what his instructions

were, but he was still in Chattanooga when I arrived there at a

later period.



It seems that Halleck suggested that I should go to Nashville as

soon as able to move and take general direction of the troops

moving from the west. I received the following dispatch dated

October 3d:   "It is the wish of the Secretary of War that as

soon as General Grant is able he will come to Cairo and report

by telegraph."  I was still very lame, but started without

delay.  Arriving at Columbus on the 16th I reported by

telegraph:  "Your dispatch from Cairo of the 3d directing me to

report from Cairo was received at 11.30 on the 10th.  Left the

same day with staff and headquarters and am here en route for

Cairo."
