THE ARMY AT PITTSBURG LANDING--INJURED BY A FALL--THE

CONFEDERATE ATTACK AT SHILOH--THE FIRST DAY'S FIGHT AT

SHILOH--GENERAL SHERMAN--CONDITION OF THE ARMY--CLOSE

 OF THE FIRST DAY'S FIGHT--THE SECOND DAY'S FIGHT--RETREAT AND

DEFEAT OF THE CONFEDERATES.



When I reassumed command on the 17th of March I found the army

divided, about half being on the east bank of the Tennessee at

Savannah, while one division was at Crump's landing on the west

bank about four miles higher up, and the remainder at Pittsburg

landing, five miles above Crump's.  The enemy was in force at

Corinth, the junction of the two most important railroads in the

Mississippi valley--one connecting Memphis and the Mississippi

River with the East, and the other leading south to all the

cotton states.  Still another railroad connects Corinth with

Jackson, in west Tennessee.  If we obtained possession of

Corinth the enemy would have no railroad for the transportation

of armies or supplies until that running east from Vicksburg was

reached.  It was the great strategic position at the West between

the Tennessee and the Mississippi rivers and between Nashville

and Vicksburg.



I at once put all the troops at Savannah in motion for Pittsburg

landing, knowing that the enemy was fortifying at Corinth and

collecting an army there under Johnston.  It was my expectation

to march against that army as soon as Buell, who had been

ordered to reinforce me with the Army of the Ohio, should

arrive; and the west bank of the river was the place to start

from.  Pittsburg is only about twenty miles from Corinth, and

Hamburg landing, four miles further up the river, is a mile or

two nearer.  I had not been in command long before I selected

Hamburg as the place to put the Army of the Ohio when it

arrived.  The roads from Pittsburg and Hamburg to Corinth

converge some eight miles out.  This disposition of the troops

would have given additional roads to march over when the advance

commenced, within supporting distance of each other.



Before I arrived at Savannah, Sherman, who had joined the Army

of the Tennessee and been placed in command of a division, had

made an expedition on steamers convoyed by gunboats to the

neighborhood of Eastport, thirty miles south, for the purpose of

destroying the railroad east of Corinth.  The rains had been so

heavy for some time before that the low-lands had become

impassable swamps.  Sherman debarked his troops and started out

to accomplish the object of the expedition; but the river was

rising so rapidly that the back-water up the small tributaries

threatened to cut off the possibility of getting back to the

boats, and the expedition had to return without reaching the

railroad.  The guns had to be hauled by hand through the water

to get back to the boats.



On the 17th of March the army on the Tennessee River consisted

of five divisions, commanded respectively by Generals C. F.

Smith, McClernand, L. Wallace, Hurlbut and Sherman.  General W.

H. L. Wallace was temporarily in command of Smith's division,

General Smith, as I have said, being confined to his bed.

Reinforcements were arriving daily and as they came up they were

organized, first into brigades, then into a division, and the

command given to General Prentiss, who had been ordered to

report to me.  General Buell was on his way from Nashville with

40,000 veterans.  On the 19th of March he was at Columbia,

Tennessee, eighty-five miles from Pittsburg.  When all

reinforcements should have arrived I expected to take the

initiative by marching on Corinth, and had no expectation of

needing fortifications, though this subject was taken into

consideration.  McPherson, my only military engineer, was

directed to lay out a line to intrench.  He did so, but reported

that it would have to be made in rear of the line of encampment

as it then ran.  The new line, while it would be nearer the

river, was yet too far away from the Tennessee, or even from the

creeks, to be easily supplied with water, and in case of attack

these creeks would be in the hands of the enemy.  The fact is, I

regarded the campaign we were engaged in as an offensive one and

had no idea that the enemy would leave strong intrenchments to

take the initiative when he knew he would be attacked where he

was if he remained.  This view, however, did not prevent every

precaution being taken and every effort made to keep advised of

all movements of the enemy.



Johnston's cavalry meanwhile had been well out towards our

front, and occasional encounters occurred between it and our

outposts.  On the 1st of April this cavalry became bold and

approached our lines, showing that an advance of some kind was

contemplated.  On the 2d Johnston left Corinth in force to

attack my army.  On the 4th his cavalry dashed down and captured

a small picket guard of six or seven men, stationed some five

miles out from Pittsburg on the Corinth road.  Colonel Buckland

sent relief to the guard at once and soon followed in person

with an entire regiment, and General Sherman followed Buckland

taking the remainder of a brigade.  The pursuit was kept up for

some three miles beyond the point where the picket guard had

been captured, and after nightfall Sherman returned to camp and

reported to me by letter what had occurred.



At this time a large body of the enemy was hovering to the west

of us, along the line of the Mobile and Ohio railroad.  My

apprehension was much greater for the safety of Crump's landing

than it was for Pittsburg.  I had no apprehension that the enemy

could really capture either place.  But I feared it was possible

that he might make a rapid dash upon Crump's and destroy our

transports and stores, most of which were kept at that point,

and then retreat before Wallace could be reinforced.  Lew.

Wallace's position I regarded as so well chosen that he was not

removed.



At this time I generally spent the day at Pittsburg and returned

to Savannah in the evening.  I was intending to remove my

headquarters to Pittsburg, but Buell was expected daily and

would come in at Savannah.  I remained at this point, therefore,

a few days longer than I otherwise should have done, in order to

meet him on his arrival.  The skirmishing in our front, however,

had been so continuous from about the 3d of April that I did not

leave Pittsburg each night until an hour when I felt there would

be no further danger before the morning.



On Friday the 4th, the day of Buckland's advance, I was very

much injured by my horse falling with me, and on me, while I was

trying to get to the front where firing had been heard.  The

night was one of impenetrable darkness, with rain pouring down

in torrents; nothing was visible to the eye except as revealed

by the frequent flashes of lightning.  Under these circumstances

I had to trust to the horse, without guidance, to keep the

road.  I had not gone far, however, when I met General W. H. L.

Wallace and Colonel (afterwards General) McPherson coming from

the direction of the front.  They said all was quiet so far as

the enemy was concerned.  On the way back to the boat my horse's

feet slipped from under him, and he fell with my leg under his

body.  The extreme softness of the ground, from the excessive

rains of the few preceding days, no doubt saved me from a severe

injury and protracted lameness.  As it was, my ankle was very

much injured, so much so that my boot had to be cut off.  For

two or three days after I was unable to walk except with

crutches.



On the 5th General Nelson, with a division of Buell's army,

arrived at Savannah and I ordered him to move up the east bank

of the river, to be in a position where he could be ferried over

to Crump's landing or Pittsburg as occasion required.  I had

learned that General Buell himself would be at Savannah the next

day, and desired to meet me on his arrival.  Affairs at Pittsburg

landing had been such for several days that I did not want to be

away during the day.  I determined, therefore, to take a very

early breakfast and ride out to meet Buell, and thus save

time.  He had arrived on the evening of the 5th, but had not

advised me of the fact and I was not aware of it until some time

after.  While I was at breakfast, however, heavy firing was heard

in the direction of Pittsburg landing, and I hastened there,

sending a hurried note to Buell informing him of the reason why

I could not meet him at Savannah.  On the way up the river I

directed the dispatch-boat to run in close to Crump's landing,

so that I could communicate with General Lew. Wallace.  I found

him waiting on a boat apparently expecting to see me, and I

directed him to get his troops in line ready to execute any

orders he might receive.  He replied that his troops were

already under arms and prepared to move.



Up to that time I had felt by no means certain that Crump's

landing might not be the point of attack.  On reaching the

front, however, about eight A.M., I found that the attack on

Pittsburg was unmistakable, and that nothing more than a small

guard, to protect our transports and stores, was needed at

Crump's.  Captain Baxter, a quartermaster on my staff, was

accordingly directed to go back and order General Wallace to

march immediately to Pittsburg by the road nearest the river.

Captain Baxter made a memorandum of this order.  About one P.M.,

not hearing from Wallace and being much in need of

reinforcements, I sent two more of my staff, Colonel McPherson

and Captain Rowley, to bring him up with his division.  They

reported finding him marching towards Purdy, Bethel, or some

point west from the river, and farther from Pittsburg by several

miles than when he started.  The road from his first position to

Pittsburg landing was direct and near the river.  Between the

two points a bridge had been built across Snake Creek by our

troops, at which Wallace's command had assisted, expressly to

enable the troops at the two places to support each other in

case of need.  Wallace did not arrive in time to take part in

the first day's fight.  General Wallace has since claimed that

the order delivered to him by Captain Baxter was simply to join

the right of the army, and that the road over which he marched

would have taken him to the road from Pittsburg to Purdy where

it crosses Owl Creek on the right of Sherman; but this is not

where I had ordered him nor where I wanted him to go.



I never could see and do not now see why any order was necessary

further than to direct him to come to Pittsburg landing, without

specifying by what route.  His was one of three veteran

divisions that had been in battle, and its absence was severely

felt.  Later in the war General Wallace would not have made the

mistake that he committed on the 6th of April, 1862.  I presume

his idea was that by taking the route he did he would be able to

come around on the flank or rear of the enemy, and thus perform

an act of heroism that would redound to the credit of his

command, as well as to the benefit of his country.



Some two or three miles from Pittsburg landing was a log

meeting-house called Shiloh.  It stood on the ridge which

divides the waters of Snake and Lick creeks, the former emptying

into the Tennessee just north of Pittsburg landing, and the

latter south.  This point was the key to our position and was

held by Sherman.  His division was at that time wholly raw, no

part of it ever having been in an engagement; but I thought this

deficiency was more than made up by the superiority of the

commander.  McClernand was on Sherman's left, with troops that

had been engaged at forts Henry and Donelson and were therefore

veterans so far as western troops had become such at that stage

of the war.  Next to McClernand came Prentiss with a raw

division, and on the extreme left, Stuart with one brigade of

Sherman's division.  Hurlbut was in rear of Prentiss, massed,

and in reserve at the time of the onset.  The division of

General C. F. Smith was on the right, also in reserve.  General

Smith was still sick in bed at Savannah, but within hearing of

our guns.  His services would no doubt have been of inestimable

value had his health permitted his presence.  The command of his

division devolved upon Brigadier-General W. H. L. Wallace, a most

estimable and able officer; a veteran too, for he had served a

year in the Mexican war and had been with his command at Henry

and Donelson.  Wallace was mortally wounded in the first day's

engagement, and with the change of commanders thus necessarily

effected in the heat of battle the efficiency of his division

was much weakened.



The position of our troops made a continuous line from Lick

Creek on the left to Owl Creek, a branch of Snake Creek, on the

right, facing nearly south and possibly a little west.  The

water in all these streams was very high at the time and

contributed to protect our flanks.  The enemy was compelled,

therefore, to attack directly in front.  This he did with great

vigor, inflicting heavy losses on the National side, but

suffering much heavier on his own.



The Confederate assaults were made with such a disregard of

losses on their own side that our line of tents soon fell into

their hands.  The ground on which the battle was fought was

undulating, heavily timbered with scattered clearings, the woods

giving some protection to the troops on both sides.  There was

also considerable underbrush.  A number of attempts were made by

the enemy to turn our right flank, where Sherman was posted, but

every effort was repulsed with heavy loss.  But the front attack

was kept up so vigorously that, to prevent the success of these

attempts to get on our flanks, the National troops were

compelled, several times, to take positions to the rear nearer

Pittsburg landing.  When the firing ceased at night the National

line was all of a mile in rear of the position it had occupied in

the morning.



In one of the backward moves, on the 6th, the division commanded

by General Prentiss did not fall back with the others.  This left

his flanks exposed and enabled the enemy to capture him with

about 2,200 of his officers and men.  General Badeau gives four

o'clock of the 6th as about the time this capture took place. He

may be right as to the time, but my recollection is that the hour

was later.  General Prentiss himself gave the hour as half-past

five.  I was with him, as I was with each of the division

commanders that day, several times, and my recollection is that

the last time I was with him was about half-past four, when his

division was standing up firmly and the General was as cool as

if expecting victory.  But no matter whether it was four or

later, the story that he and his command were surprised and

captured in their camps is without any foundation whatever.  If

it had been true, as currently reported at the time and yet

believed by thousands of people, that Prentiss and his division

had been captured in their beds, there would not have been an

all-day struggle, with the loss of thousands killed and wounded

on the Confederate side.



With the single exception of a few minutes after the capture of

Prentiss, a continuous and unbroken line was maintained all day

from Snake Creek or its tributaries on the right to Lick Creek

or the Tennessee on the left above Pittsburg.



There was no hour during the day when there was not heavy firing

and generally hard fighting at some point on the line, but seldom

at all points at the same time.  It was a case of Southern dash

against Northern pluck and endurance.  Three of the five

divisions engaged on Sunday were entirely raw, and many of the

men had only received their arms on the way from their States to

the field.  Many of them had arrived but a day or two before and

were hardly able to load their muskets according to the

manual.  Their officers were equally ignorant of their duties.

Under these circumstances it is not astonishing that many of the

regiments broke at the first fire.  In two cases, as I now

remember, colonels led their regiments from the field on first

hearing the whistle of the enemy's bullets.  In these cases the

colonels were constitutional cowards, unfit for any military

position; but not so the officers and men led out of danger by

them.  Better troops never went upon a battle-field than many of

these, officers and men, afterwards proved themselves to be, who

fled panic stricken at the first whistle of bullets and shell at

Shiloh.



During the whole of Sunday I was continuously engaged in passing

from one part of the field to another, giving directions to

division commanders.  In thus moving along the line, however, I

never deemed it important to stay long with Sherman.  Although

his troops were then under fire for the first time, their

commander, by his constant presence with them, inspired a

confidence in officers and men that enabled them to render

services on that bloody battle-field worthy of the best of

veterans.  McClernand was next to Sherman, and the hardest

fighting was in front of these two divisions.  McClernand told

me on that day, the 6th, that he profited much by having so able

a commander supporting him.  A casualty to Sherman that would

have taken him from the field that day would have been a sad one

for the troops engaged at Shiloh.  And how near we came to this!

On the 6th Sherman was shot twice, once in the hand, once in the

shoulder, the ball cutting his coat and making a slight wound,

and a third ball passed through his hat.  In addition to this he

had several horses shot during the day.



The nature of this battle was such that cavalry could not be

used in front; I therefore formed ours into line in rear, to

stop stragglers--of whom there were many.  When there would be

enough of them to make a show, and after they had recovered from

their fright, they would be sent to reinforce some part of the

line which needed support, without regard to their companies,

regiments or brigades.



On one occasion during the day I rode back as far as the river

and met General Buell, who had just arrived; I do not remember

the hour, but at that time there probably were as many as four

or five thousand stragglers lying under cover of the river

bluff, panic-stricken, most of whom would have been shot where

they lay, without resistance, before they would have taken

muskets and marched to the front to protect themselves.  This

meeting between General Buell and myself was on the

dispatch-boat used to run between the landing and Savannah.  It

was brief, and related specially to his getting his troops over

the river.  As we left the boat together, Buell's attention was

attracted by the men lying under cover of the river bank.  I saw

him berating them and trying to shame them into joining their

regiments.  He even threatened them with shells from the

gunboats near by.  But it was all to no effect.  Most of these

men afterward proved themselves as gallant as any of those who

saved the battle from which they had deserted.  I have no doubt

that this sight impressed General Buell with the idea that a

line of retreat would be a good thing just then.  If he had come

in by the front instead of through the stragglers in the rear, he

would have thought and felt differently.  Could he have come

through the Confederate rear, he would have witnessed there a

scene similar to that at our own.  The distant rear of an army

engaged in battle is not the best place from which to judge

correctly what is going on in front.  Later in the war, while

occupying the country between the Tennessee and the Mississippi,

I learned that the panic in the Confederate lines had not

differed much from that within our own.  Some of the country

people estimated the stragglers from Johnston's army as high as

20,000.  Of course this was an exaggeration.



The situation at the close of Sunday was as follows:  along the

top of the bluff just south of the log-house which stood at

Pittsburg landing, Colonel J. D. Webster, of my staff, had

arranged twenty or more pieces of artillery facing south or up

the river.  This line of artillery was on the crest of a hill

overlooking a deep ravine opening into the Tennessee.  Hurlbut

with his division intact was on the right of this artillery,

extending west and possibly a little north.  McClernand came

next in the general line, looking more to the west.  His

division was complete in its organization and ready for any

duty.  Sherman came next, his right extending to Snake Creek.

His command, like the other two, was complete in its

organization and ready, like its chief, for any service it might

be called upon to render.  All three divisions were, as a matter

of course, more or less shattered and depleted in numbers from

the terrible battle of the day.  The division of W. H. L.

Wallace, as much from the disorder arising from changes of

division and brigade commanders, under heavy fire, as from any

other cause, had lost its organization and did not occupy a

place in the line as a division.  Prentiss' command was gone as

a division, many of its members having been killed, wounded or

captured, but it had rendered valiant services before its final

dispersal, and had contributed a good share to the defence of

Shiloh.



The right of my line rested near the bank of Snake Creek, a

short distance above the bridge which had been built by the

troops for the purpose of connecting Crump's landing and

Pittsburg landing.  Sherman had posted some troops in a

log-house and out-buildings which overlooked both the bridge

over which Wallace was expected and the creek above that

point.  In this last position Sherman was frequently attacked

before night, but held the point until he voluntarily abandoned

it to advance in order to make room for Lew. Wallace, who came

up after dark.



There was, as I have said, a deep ravine in front of our left.

The Tennessee River was very high and there was water to a

considerable depth in the ravine.  Here the enemy made a last

desperate effort to turn our flank, but was repelled.  The

gunboats Tyler and Lexington, Gwin and Shirk commanding, with

the artillery under Webster, aided the army and effectually

checked their further progress.  Before any of Buell's troops

had reached the west bank of the Tennessee, firing had almost

entirely ceased; anything like an attempt on the part of the

enemy to advance had absolutely ceased.  There was some

artillery firing from an unseen enemy, some of his shells

passing beyond us; but I do not remember that there was the

whistle of a single musket-ball heard.  As his troops arrived in

the dusk General Buell marched several of his regiments part way

down the face of the hill where they fired briskly for some

minutes, but I do not think a single man engaged in this firing

received an injury.  The attack had spent its force.



General Lew. Wallace, with 5,000 effective men, arrived after

firing had ceased for the day, and was placed on the right. Thus

night came, Wallace came, and the advance of Nelson's division

came; but none--unless night--in time to be of material service

to the gallant men who saved Shiloh on that first day against

large odds.  Buell's loss on the 6th of April was two men killed

and one wounded, all members of the 36th Indiana infantry.  The

Army of the Tennessee lost on that day at least 7,000 men.  The

presence of two or three regiments of Buell's army on the west

bank before firing ceased had not the slightest effect in

preventing the capture of Pittsburg landing.



So confident was I before firing had ceased on the 6th that the

next day would bring victory to our arms if we could only take

the initiative, that I visited each division commander in person

before any reinforcements had reached the field.  I directed them

to throw out heavy lines of skirmishers in the morning as soon as

they could see, and push them forward until they found the enemy,

following with their entire divisions in supporting distance, and

to engage the enemy as soon as found.  To Sherman I told the

story of the assault at Fort Donelson, and said that the same

tactics would win at Shiloh.  Victory was assured when Wallace

arrived, even if there had been no other support.  I was glad,

however, to see the reinforcements of Buell and credit them with

doing all there was for them to do.



During the night of the 6th the remainder of Nelson's division,

Buell's army crossed the river and were ready to advance in the

morning, forming the left wing.  Two other divisions,

Crittenden's and McCook's, came up the river from Savannah in

the transports and were on the west bank early on the 7th. Buell

commanded them in person.  My command was thus nearly doubled in

numbers and efficiency.



During the night rain fell in torrents and our troops were

exposed to the storm without shelter.  I made my headquarters

under a tree a few hundred yards back from the river bank.  My

ankle was so much swollen from the fall of my horse the Friday

night preceding, and the bruise was so painful, that I could get

no rest.



The drenching rain would have precluded the possibility of sleep

without this additional cause.  Some time after midnight, growing

restive under the storm and the continuous pain, I moved back to

the log-house under the bank.  This had been taken as a

hospital, and all night wounded men were being brought in, their

wounds dressed, a leg or an arm amputated as the case might

require, and everything being done to save life or alleviate

suffering.  The sight was more unendurable than encountering the

enemy's fire, and I returned to my tree in the rain.



The advance on the morning of the 7th developed the enemy in the

camps occupied by our troops before the battle began, more than a

mile back from the most advanced position of the Confederates on

the day before.  It is known now that they had not yet learned

of the arrival of Buell's command.  Possibly they fell back so

far to get the shelter of our tents during the rain, and also to

get away from the shells that were dropped upon them by the

gunboats every fifteen minutes during the night.



The position of the Union troops on the morning of the 7th was

as follows:  General Lew. Wallace on the right; Sherman on his

left; then McClernand and then Hurlbut.  Nelson, of Buell's

army, was on our extreme left, next to the river.



Crittenden was next in line after Nelson and on his right,

McCook followed and formed the extreme right of Buell's

command.  My old command thus formed the right wing, while the

troops directly under Buell constituted the left wing of the

army.  These relative positions were retained during the entire

day, or until the enemy was driven from the field.



In a very short time the battle became general all along the

line.  This day everything was favorable to the Union side.  We

had now become the attacking party.  The enemy was driven back

all day, as we had been the day before, until finally he beat a

precipitate retreat.  The last point held by him was near the

road leading from the landing to Corinth, on the left of Sherman

and right of McClernand.  About three o'clock, being near that

point and seeing that the enemy was giving way everywhere else,

I gathered up a couple of regiments, or parts of regiments, from

troops near by, formed them in line of battle and marched them

forward, going in front myself to prevent premature or

long-range firing.  At this point there was a clearing between

us and the enemy favorable for charging, although exposed.  I

knew the enemy were ready to break and only wanted a little

encouragement from us to go quickly and join their friends who

had started earlier.  After marching to within musket-range I

stopped and let the troops pass.  The command, CHARGE, was

given, and was executed with loud cheers and with a run; when

the last of the enemy broke. (*7)
