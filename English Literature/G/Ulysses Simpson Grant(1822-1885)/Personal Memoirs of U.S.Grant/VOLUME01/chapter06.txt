ADVANCE OF THE ARMY--CROSSING THE COLORADO--THE RIO GRANDE.



At last the preparations were complete and orders were issued

for the advance to begin on the 8th of March.  General Taylor

had an army of not more than three thousand men.  One battery,

the siege guns and all the convalescent troops were sent on by

water to Brazos Santiago, at the mouth of the Rio Grande.  A

guard was left back at Corpus Christi to look after public

property and to take care of those who were too sick to be

removed.  The remainder of the army, probably not more than

twenty five hundred men, was divided into three brigades, with

the cavalry independent.  Colonel Twiggs, with seven companies

of dragoons and a battery of light artillery, moved on the

8th.  He was followed by the three infantry brigades, with a

day's interval between the commands.  Thus the rear brigade did

not move from Corpus Christi until the 11th of March.  In view

of the immense bodies of men moved on the same day over narrow

roads, through dense forests and across large streams, in our

late war, it seems strange now that a body of less than three

thousand men should have been broken into four columns,

separated by a day's march.



General Taylor was opposed to anything like plundering by the

troops, and in this instance, I doubt not, he looked upon the

enemy as the aggrieved party and was not willing to injure them

further than his instructions from Washington demanded.  His

orders to the troops enjoined scrupulous regard for the rights

of all peaceable persons and the payment of the highest price

for all supplies taken for the use of the army.



All officers of foot regiments who had horses were permitted to

ride them on the march when it did not interfere with their

military duties.  As already related, having lost my "five or

six dollars' worth of horses " but a short time before I

determined not to get another, but to make the journey on

foot.  My company commander, Captain McCall, had two good

American horses, of considerably more value in that country,

where native horses were cheap, than they were in the States. He

used one himself and wanted the other for his servant.  He was

quite anxious to know whether I did not intend to get me another

horse before the march began.  I told him No; I belonged to a

foot regiment.  I did not understand the object of his

solicitude at the time, but, when we were about to start, he

said:  "There, Grant, is a horse for you."  I found that he

could not bear the idea of his servant riding on a long march

while his lieutenant went a-foot.  He had found a mustang, a

three-year old colt only recently captured, which had been

purchased by one of the colored servants with the regiment for

the sum of three dollars.  It was probably the only horse at

Corpus Christi that could have been purchased just then for any

reasonable price.  Five dollars, sixty-six and two-thirds per

cent. advance, induced the owner to part with the mustang.  I

was sorry to take him, because I really felt that, belonging to

a foot regiment, it was my duty to march with the men.  But I

saw the Captain's earnestness in the matter, and accepted the

horse for the trip.  The day we started was the first time the

horse had ever been under saddle. I had, however, but little

difficulty in breaking him, though for the first day there were

frequent disagreements between us as to which way we should go,

and sometimes whether we should go at all.  At no time during

the day could I choose exactly the part of the column I would

march with; but after that, I had as tractable a horse as any

with the army, and there was none that stood the trip better. He

never ate a mouthful of food on the journey except the grass he

could pick within the length of his picket rope.



A few days out from Corpus Christi, the immense herd of wild

horses that ranged at that time between the Nueces and the Rio

Grande was seen directly in advance of the head of the column

and but a few miles off.  It was the very band from which the

horse I was riding had been captured but a few weeks before. The

column was halted for a rest, and a number of officers, myself

among them, rode out two or three miles to the right to see the

extent of the herd.  The country was a rolling prairie, and,

from the higher ground, the vision was obstructed only by the

earth's curvature.  As far as the eye could reach to our right,

the herd extended.  To the left, it extended equally. There was

no estimating the number of animals in it; I have no idea that

they could all have been corralled in the State of Rhode Island,

or Delaware, at one time.  If they had been, they would have been

so thick that the pasturage would have given out the first day. 

People who saw the Southern herd of buffalo, fifteen or twenty

years ago, can appreciate the  size of the Texas band of wild

horses in 1846.



At the point where the army struck the Little Colorado River,

the stream was quite wide and of sufficient depth for

navigation. The water was brackish and the banks were fringed

with timber. Here the whole army concentrated before attempting

to cross. The army was not accompanied by a pontoon train, and

at that time the troops were not instructed in bridge

building.  To add to the embarrassment of the situation, the

army was here, for the first time, threatened with opposition. 

Buglers, concealed from our view by the brush on the opposite

side, sounded the "assembly," and other military calls.  Like

the wolves before spoken of, they gave the impression that there

was a large number of them and that, if the troops were in

proportion to the noise, they were sufficient to devour General

Taylor and his army.  There were probably but few troops, and

those engaged principally in watching the movements of the

"invader."  A few of our cavalry dashed in, and forded and swam

the stream, and all opposition was soon dispersed.  I do not

remember that a single shot was fired.



The troops waded the stream, which was up to their necks in the

deepest part.  Teams were crossed by attaching a long rope to

the end of the wagon tongue passing it between the two swing

mules and by the side of the leader, hitching his bridle as well

as the bridle of the mules in rear to it, and carrying the end to

men on the opposite shore.  The bank down to the water was steep

on both sides.  A rope long enough to cross the river,

therefore, was attached to the back axle of the wagon, and men

behind would hold the rope to prevent the wagon "beating" the

mules into the water.  This latter rope also served the purpose

of bringing the end of the forward one back, to be used over

again.  The water was deep enough for a short distance to swim

the little Mexican mules which the army was then using, but

they, and the wagons, were pulled through so fast by the men at

the end of the rope ahead, that no time was left them to show

their obstinacy.  In this manner the artillery and

transportation of the "army of occupation" crossed the Colorado

River.



About the middle of the month of March the advance of the army

reached the Rio Grande and went into camp near the banks of the

river, opposite the city of Matamoras and almost under the guns

of a small fort at the lower end of the town.  There was not at

that time a single habitation from Corpus Christi until the Rio

Grande was reached.



The work of fortifying was commenced at once.  The fort was laid

out by the engineers, but the work was done by the soldiers under

the supervision of their officers, the chief engineer retaining

general directions.  The Mexicans now became so incensed at our

near approach that some of their troops crossed the river above

us, and made it unsafe for small bodies of men to go far beyond

the limits of camp.  They captured two companies of dragoons,

commanded by Captains Thornton and Hardee.  The latter figured

as a general in the late war, on the Confederate side, and was

author of the tactics first used by both armies.  Lieutenant

Theodric Porter, of the 4th infantry, was killed while out with

a small detachment; and Major Cross, the assistant

quartermaster-general, had also been killed not far from camp.



There was no base of supplies nearer than Point Isabel, on the

coast, north of the mouth of the Rio Grande and twenty-five

miles away.  The enemy, if the Mexicans could be called such at

this time when no war had been declared, hovered about in such

numbers that it was not safe to send a wagon train after

supplies with any escort that could be spared.  I have already

said that General Taylor's whole command on the Rio Grande

numbered less than three thousand men.  He had, however, a few

more troops at Point Isabel or Brazos Santiago.  The supplies

brought from Corpus Christi in wagons were running short.  Work

was therefore pushed with great vigor on the defences, to enable

the minimum number of troops to hold the fort.  All the men who

could be employed, were kept at work from early dawn until

darkness closed the labors of the day.  With all this the fort

was not completed until the supplies grew so short that further

delay in obtaining more could not be thought of.  By the latter

part of April the work was in a partially defensible condition,

and the 7th infantry, Major Jacob Brown commanding, was marched

in to garrison it, with some few pieces of artillery.  All the

supplies on hand, with the exception of enough to carry the rest

of the army to Point Isabel, were left with the garrison, and the

march was commenced with the remainder of the command, every

wagon being taken with the army.  Early on the second day after

starting the force reached its destination, without opposition

from the Mexicans.  There was some delay in getting supplies

ashore from vessels at anchor in the open roadstead.
