RESIGNATION--PRIVATE LIFE--LIFE AT GALENA--THE COMING CRISIS.



My family, all this while, was at the East.  It consisted now of

a wife and two children.  I saw no chance of supporting them on

the Pacific coast out of my pay as an army officer.  I

concluded, therefore, to resign, and in March applied for a

leave of absence until the end of the July following, tendering

my resignation to take effect at the end of that time.  I left

the Pacific coast very much attached to it, and with the full

expectation of making it my future home.  That expectation and

that hope remained uppermost in my mind until the Lieutenant-

Generalcy bill was introduced into Congress in the winter of

1863-4.  The passage of that bill, and my promotion, blasted my

last hope of ever becoming a citizen of the further West.



In the late summer of 1854 I rejoined my family, to find in it a

son whom I had never seen, born while I was on the Isthmus of

Panama.  I was now to commence, at the age of thirty-two, a new

struggle for our support.  My wife had a farm near St. Louis, to

which we went, but I had no means to stock it.  A house had to be

built also.  I worked very hard, never losing a day because of

bad weather, and accomplished the object in a moderate way.  If

nothing else could be done I would load a cord of wood on a

wagon and take it to the city for sale.  I managed to keep along

very well until 1858, when I was attacked by fever and ague.  I

had suffered very severely and for a long time from this

disease, while a boy in Ohio.  It lasted now over a year, and,

while it did not keep me in the house, it did interfere greatly

with the amount of work I was able to perform.  In the fall of

1858 I sold out my stock, crops and farming utensils at auction,

and gave up farming.



In the winter I established a partnership with Harry Boggs, a

cousin of Mrs.  Grant, in the real estate agency business.  I

spent that winter at St. Louis myself, but did not take my

family into town until the spring.  Our business might have

become prosperous if I had been able to wait for it to grow.  As

it was, there was no more than one person could attend to, and

not enough to support two families.  While a citizen of St.

Louis and engaged in the real estate agency business, I was a

candidate for the office of county engineer, an office of

respectability and emolument which would have been very

acceptable to me at that time.  The incumbent was appointed by

the county court, which consisted of five members.  My opponent

had the advantage of birth over me (he was a citizen by

adoption) and carried off the prize.  I now withdrew from the

co-partnership with Boggs, and, in May, 1860, removed to Galena,

Illinois, and took a clerkship in my father's store.



While a citizen of Missouri, my first opportunity for casting a

vote at a Presidential election occurred.  I had been in the

army from before attaining my majority and had thought but

little about politics, although I was a Whig by education and a

great admirer of Mr. Clay.  But the Whig party had ceased to

exist before I had an opportunity of exercising the privilege of

casting a ballot; the Know-Nothing party had taken its place, but

was on the wane; and the Republican party was in a chaotic state

and had not yet received a name.  It had no existence in the

Slave States except at points on the borders next to Free

States.  In St. Louis City and County, what afterwards became

the Republican party was known as the Free-Soil Democracy, led

by the Honorable Frank P. Blair.  Most of my neighbors had known

me as an officer of the army with Whig proclivities.  They had

been on the same side, and, on the death of their party, many

had become Know-Nothings, or members of the American party.

There was a lodge near my new home, and I was invited to join

it.  I accepted the invitation; was initiated; attended a

meeting just one week later, and never went to another

afterwards.



I have no apologies to make for having been one week a member of

the American party; for I still think native-born citizens of the

United States should have as much protection, as many privileges

in their native country, as those who voluntarily select it for

a home.  But all secret, oath-bound political parties are

dangerous to any nation, no matter how pure or how patriotic the

motives and principles which first bring them together.  No

political party can or ought to exist when one of its

corner-stones is opposition to freedom of thought and to the

right to worship God "according to the dictate of one's own

conscience," or according to the creed of any religious

denomination whatever.  Nevertheless, if a sect sets up its laws

as binding above the State laws, wherever the two come in

conflict this claim must be resisted and suppressed at whatever

cost.



Up to the Mexican war there were a few out and out

abolitionists, men who carried their hostility to slavery into

all elections, from those for a justice of the peace up to the

Presidency of the United States.  They were noisy but not

numerous.  But the great majority of people at the North, where

slavery did not exist, were opposed to the institution, and

looked upon its existence in any part of the country as

unfortunate.  They did not hold the States where slavery existed

responsible for it; and believed that protection should be given

to the right of property in slaves until some satisfactory way

could be reached to be rid of the institution.  Opposition to

slavery was not a creed of either political party.  In some

sections more anti-slavery men belonged to the Democratic party,

and in others to the Whigs.  But with the inauguration of the

Mexican war, in fact with the annexation of Texas, "the

inevitable conflict" commenced.



As the time for the Presidential election of 1856--the first at

which I had the opportunity of voting--approached, party feeling

began to run high.  The Republican party was regarded in the

South and the border States not only as opposed to the extension

of slavery, but as favoring the compulsory abolition of the

institution without compensation to the owners.  The most

horrible visions seemed to present themselves to the minds of

people who, one would suppose, ought to have known better.  Many

educated and, otherwise, sensible persons appeared to believe

that emancipation meant social equality.  Treason to the

Government was openly advocated and was not rebuked.  It was

evident to my mind that the election of a Republican President

in 1856 meant the secession of all the Slave States, and

rebellion.  Under these circumstances I preferred the success of

a candidate whose election would prevent or postpone secession,

to seeing the country plunged into a war the end of which no man

could foretell.  With a Democrat elected by the unanimous vote of

the Slave States, there could be no pretext for secession for

four years.  I very much hoped that the passions of the people

would subside in that time, and the catastrophe be averted

altogether; if it was not, I believed the country would be

better prepared to receive the shock and to resist it.  I

therefore voted for James Buchanan for President.  Four years

later the Republican party was successful in electing its

candidate to the Presidency.  The civilized world has learned

the consequence.  Four millions of human beings held as chattels

have been liberated; the ballot has been given to them; the free

schools of the country have been opened to their children.  The

nation still lives, and the people are just as free to avoid

social intimacy with the blacks as ever they were, or as they

are with white people.



While living in Galena I was nominally only a clerk supporting

myself and family on a stipulated salary.  In reality my

position was different.  My father had never lived in Galena

himself, but had established my two brothers there, the one next

younger than myself in charge of the business, assisted by the

youngest.  When I went there it was my father's intention to

give up all connection with the business himself, and to

establish his three sons in it:  but the brother who had really

built up the business was sinking with consumption, and it was

not thought best to make any change while he was in this

condition.  He lived until September, 1861, when he succumbed to

that insidious disease which always flatters its victims into the

belief that they are growing better up to the close of life.  A

more honorable man never transacted business.  In September,

1861, I was engaged in an employment which required all my

attention elsewhere.



During the eleven months that I lived in Galena prior to the

first call for volunteers, I had been strictly attentive to my

business, and had made but few acquaintances other than

customers and people engaged in the same line with myself.  When

the election took place in November, 1860, I had not been a

resident of Illinois long enough to gain citizenship and could

not, therefore, vote.  I was really glad of this at the time,

for my pledges would have compelled me to vote for Stephen A.

Douglas, who had no possible chance of election.  The contest

was really between Mr. Breckinridge and Mr. Lincoln; between

minority rule and rule by the majority.  I wanted, as between

these candidates, to see Mr. Lincoln elected.  Excitement ran

high during the canvass, and torch-light processions enlivened

the scene in the generally quiet streets of Galena many nights

during the campaign.  I did not parade with either party, but

occasionally met with the "wide awakes"--Republicans--in their

rooms, and superintended their drill.  It was evident, from the

time of the Chicago nomination to the close of the canvass, that

the election of the Republican candidate would be the signal for

some of the Southern States to secede.  I still had hopes that

the four years which had elapsed since the first nomination of a

Presidential candidate by a party distinctly opposed to slavery

extension, had given time for the extreme pro-slavery sentiment

to cool down; for the Southerners to think well before they took

the awful leap which they had so vehemently threatened.  But I

was mistaken.



The Republican candidate was elected, and solid substantial

people of the North-west, and I presume the same order of people

throughout the entire North, felt very serious, but determined,

after this event.  It was very much discussed whether the South

would carry out its threat to secede and set up a separate

government, the corner-stone of which should be, protection to

the "Divine" institution of slavery.  For there were people who

believed in the "divinity" of human slavery, as there are now

people who believe Mormonism and Polygamy to be ordained by the

Most High.  We forgive them for entertaining such notions, but

forbid their practice.  It was generally believed that there

would be a flurry; that some of the extreme Southern States

would go so far as to pass ordinances of secession.  But the

common impression was that this step was so plainly suicidal for

the South, that the movement would not spread over much of the

territory and would not last long.



Doubtless the founders of our government, the majority of them

at least, regarded the confederation of the colonies as an

experiment.  Each colony considered itself a separate

government; that the confederation was for mutual protection

against a foreign foe, and the prevention of strife and war

among themselves.  If there had been a desire on the part of any

single State to withdraw from the compact at any time while the

number of States was limited to the original thirteen, I do not

suppose there would have been any to contest the right, no

matter how much the determination might have been regretted. The

problem changed on the ratification of the Constitution by all

the colonies; it changed still more when amendments were added;

and if the right of any one State to withdraw continued to exist

at all after the ratification of the Constitution, it certainly

ceased on the formation of new States, at least so far as the

new States themselves were concerned.  It was never possessed at

all by Florida or the States west of the Mississippi, all of

which were purchased by the treasury of the entire nation. 

Texas and the territory brought into the Union in consequence of

annexation, were purchased with both blood and treasure; and

Texas, with a domain greater than that of any European state

except Russia, was permitted to retain as state property all the

public lands within its borders.  It would have been ingratitude

and injustice of the most flagrant sort for this State to

withdraw from the Union after all that had been spent and done

to introduce her; yet, if separation had actually occurred,

Texas must necessarily have gone with the South, both on account

of her institutions and her geographical position. Secession was

illogical as well as impracticable; it was revolution.



Now, the right of revolution is an inherent one.  When people

are oppressed by their government, it is a natural right they

enjoy to relieve themselves of the oppression, if they are

strong enough, either by withdrawal from it, or by overthrowing

it and substituting a government more acceptable.  But any

people or part of a people who resort to this remedy, stake

their lives, their property, and every claim for protection

given by citizenship--on the issue.  Victory, or the conditions

imposed by the conqueror--must be the result.



In the case of the war between the States it would have been the

exact truth if the South had said,--"We do not want to live with

you Northern people any longer; we know our institution of

slavery is obnoxious to you, and, as you are growing numerically

stronger than we, it may at some time in the future be

endangered.  So long as you permitted us to control the

government, and with the aid of a few friends at the North to

enact laws constituting your section a guard against the escape

of our property, we were willing to live with you.  You have

been submissive to our rule heretofore; but it looks now as if

you did not intend to continue so, and we will remain in the

Union no longer."  Instead of this the seceding States cried

lustily,--"Let us alone; you have no constitutional power to

interfere with us."  Newspapers and people at the North

reiterated the cry.  Individuals might ignore the constitution;

but the Nation itself must not only obey it, but must enforce

the strictest construction of that instrument; the construction

put upon it by the Southerners themselves.  The fact is the

constitution did not apply to any such contingency as the one

existing from 1861 to 1865.  Its framers never dreamed of such a

contingency occurring.  If they had foreseen it, the

probabilities are they would have sanctioned the right of a

State or States to withdraw rather than that there should be war

between brothers.



The framers were wise in their generation and wanted to do the

very best possible to secure their own liberty and independence,

and that also of their descendants to the latest days.  It is

preposterous to suppose that the people of one generation can

lay down the best and only rules of government for all who are

to come after them, and under unforeseen contingencies.  At the

time of the framing of our constitution the only physical forces

that had been subdued and made to serve man and do his labor,

were the currents in the streams and in the air we breathe. Rude

machinery, propelled by water power, had been invented; sails to

propel ships upon the waters had been set to catch the passing

breeze--but the application of stream to propel vessels against

both wind and current, and machinery to do all manner of work

had not been thought of.  The instantaneous transmission of

messages around the world by means of electricity would probably

at that day have been attributed to witchcraft or a league with

the Devil.  Immaterial circumstances had changed as greatly as

material ones.  We could not and ought not to be rigidly bound

by the rules laid down under circumstances so different for

emergencies so utterly unanticipated.  The fathers themselves

would have been the first to declare that their prerogatives

were not irrevocable.  They would surely have resisted secession

could they have lived to see the shape it assumed.



I travelled through the Northwest considerably during the winter

of 1860-1.  We had customers in all the little towns in

south-west Wisconsin, south-east Minnesota and north-east

Iowa.  These generally knew I had been a captain in the regular

army and had served through the Mexican war.  Consequently

wherever I stopped at night, some of the people would come to

the public-house where I was, and sit till a late hour

discussing the probabilities of the future.  My own views at

that time were like those officially expressed by Mr. Seward at

a later day, that "the war would be over in ninety days."  I

continued to entertain these views until after the battle of

Shiloh.  I believe now that there would have been no more

battles at the West after the capture of Fort Donelson if all

the troops in that region had been under a single commander who

would have followed up that victory.



There is little doubt in my mind now that the prevailing

sentiment of the South would have been opposed to secession in

1860 and 1861, if there had been a fair and calm expression of

opinion, unbiased by threats, and if the ballot of one legal

voter had counted for as much as that of any other.  But there

was no calm discussion of the question.  Demagogues who were too

old to enter the army if there should be a war, others who

entertained so high an opinion of their own ability that they

did not believe they could be spared from the direction of the

affairs of state in such an event, declaimed vehemently and

unceasingly against the North; against its aggressions upon the

South; its interference with Southern rights, etc., etc.  They

denounced the Northerners as cowards, poltroons, negro-

worshippers; claimed that one Southern man was equal to five

Northern men in battle; that if the South would stand up for its

rights the North would back down.  Mr. Jefferson Davis said in a

speech, delivered at La Grange, Mississippi, before the

secession of that State, that he would agree to drink all the

blood spilled south of Mason and Dixon's line if there should be

a war.  The young men who would have the fighting to do in case

of war, believed all these statements, both in regard to the

aggressiveness of the North and its cowardice.  They, too, cried

out for a separation from such people.  The great bulk of the

legal voters of the South were men who owned no slaves; their

homes were generally in the hills and poor country; their

facilities for educating their children, even up to the point of

reading and writing, were very limited; their interest in the

contest was very meagre--what there was, if they had been

capable of seeing it, was with the North; they too needed

emancipation.  Under the old regime they were looked down upon

by those who controlled all the affairs in the interest of

slave-owners, as poor white trash who were allowed the ballot so

long as they cast it according to direction.



I am aware that this last statement may be disputed and

individual testimony perhaps adduced to show that in ante-bellum

days the ballot was as untrammelled in the south as in any

section of the country; but in the face of any such

contradiction I reassert the statement.  The shot-gun was not

resorted to.  Masked men did not ride over the country at night

intimidating voters; but there was a firm feeling that a class

existed in every State with a sort of divine right to control

public affairs.  If they could not get this control by one means

they must by another.  The end justified the means.  The

coercion, if mild, was complete.



There were two political parties, it is true, in all the States,

both strong in numbers and respectability, but both equally loyal

to the institution which stood paramount in Southern eyes to all

other institutions in state or nation.  The slave-owners were

the minority, but governed both parties.  Had politics ever

divided the slave-holders and the non-slave-holders, the

majority would have been obliged to yield, or internecine war

would have been the consequence.  I do not know that the

Southern people were to blame for this condition of affairs.

There was a time when slavery was not profitable, and the

discussion of the merits of the institution was confined almost

exclusively to the territory where it existed.  The States of

Virginia and Kentucky came near abolishing slavery by their own

acts, one State defeating the measure by a tie vote and the

other only lacking one.  But when the institution became

profitable, all talk of its abolition ceased where it existed;

and naturally, as human nature is constituted, arguments were

adduced in its support.  The cotton-gin probably had much to do

with the justification of slavery.



The winter of 1860-1 will be remembered by middle-aged people of

to-day as one of great excitement.  South Carolina promptly

seceded after the result of the Presidential election was

known.  Other Southern States proposed to follow.  In some of

them the Union sentiment was so strong that it had to be

suppressed by force.  Maryland, Delaware, Kentucky and Missouri,

all Slave States, failed to pass ordinances of secession; but

they were all represented in the so-called congress of the

so-called Confederate States.  The Governor and Lieutenant-

Governor of Missouri, in 1861, Jackson and Reynolds, were both

supporters of the rebellion and took refuge with the enemy.  The

governor soon died, and the lieutenant-governor assumed his

office; issued proclamations as governor of the State; was

recognized as such by the Confederate Government, and continued

his pretensions until the collapse of the rebellion. The South

claimed the sovereignty of States, but claimed the right to

coerce into their confederation such States as they wanted, that

is, all the States where slavery existed.  They did not seem to

think this course inconsistent.  The fact is, the Southern

slave-owners believed that, in some way, the ownership of slaves

conferred a sort of patent of nobility--a right to govern

independent of the interest or wishes of those who did not hold

such property.  They convinced themselves, first, of the divine

origin of the institution and, next, that that particular

institution was not safe in the hands of any body of legislators

but themselves.



Meanwhile the Administration of President Buchanan looked

helplessly on and proclaimed that the general government had no

power to interfere; that the Nation had no power to save its own

life.  Mr. Buchanan had in his cabinet two members at least, who

were as earnest--to use a mild term--in the cause of secession

as Mr. Davis or any Southern statesman.  One of them, Floyd, the

Secretary of War, scattered the army so that much of it could be

captured when hostilities should commence, and distributed the

cannon and small arms from Northern arsenals throughout the

South so as to be on hand when treason wanted them.  The navy

was scattered in like manner.  The President did not prevent his

cabinet preparing for war upon their government, either by

destroying its resources or storing them in the South until a de

facto government was established with Jefferson Davis as its

President, and Montgomery, Alabama, as the Capital.  The

secessionists had then to leave the cabinet.  In their own

estimation they were aliens in the country which had given them

birth.  Loyal men were put into their places.  Treason in the

executive branch of the government was estopped.  But the harm

had already been done.  The stable door was locked after the

horse had been stolen.



During all of the trying winter of 1860-1, when the Southerners

were so defiant that they would not allow within their borders

the expression of a sentiment hostile to their views, it was a

brave man indeed who could stand up and proclaim his loyalty to

the Union.  On the other hand men at the North--prominent

men--proclaimed that the government had no power to coerce the

South into submission to the laws of the land; that if the North

undertook to raise armies to go south, these armies would have to

march over the dead bodies of the speakers.  A portion of the

press of the North was constantly proclaiming similar views.


When the time arrived for the President-elect to go to the

capital of the Nation to be sworn into office, it was deemed

unsafe for him to travel, not only as a President-elect, but as

any private citizen should be allowed to do.  Instead of going

in a special car, receiving the good wishes of his constituents

at all the stations along the road, he was obliged to stop on

the way and to be smuggled into the capital.  He disappeared

from public view on his journey, and the next the country knew,

his arrival was announced at the capital.  There is little doubt

that he would have been assassinated if he had attempted to

travel openly throughout his journey.
