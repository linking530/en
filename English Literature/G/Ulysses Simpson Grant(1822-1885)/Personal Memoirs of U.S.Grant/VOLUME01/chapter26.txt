HALLECK ASSUMES COMMAND IN THE FIELD--THE ADVANCE UPON

CORINTH--OCCUPATION OF CORINTH--THE ARMY SEPARATED.



General Halleck arrived at Pittsburg landing on the 11th of

April and immediately assumed command in the field.  On the 21st

General Pope arrived with an army 30,000 strong, fresh from the

capture of Island Number Ten in the Mississippi River.  He went

into camp at Hamburg landing five miles above Pittsburg. Halleck

had now three armies:  the Army of the Ohio, Buell commanding;

the Army of the Mississippi, Pope commanding; and the Army of

the Tennessee.  His orders divided the combined force into the

right wing, reserve, centre and left wing. Major-General George

H. Thomas, who had been in Buell's army, was transferred with

his division to the Army of the Tennessee and given command of

the right wing, composed of all of that army except McClernand's

and Lew. Wallace's divisions. McClernand was assigned to the

command of the reserve, composed of his own and Lew. Wallace's

divisions.  Buell commanded the centre, the Army of the Ohio;

and Pope the left wing, the Army of the Mississippi.  I was

named second in command of the whole, and was also supposed to

be in command of the right wing and reserve.



Orders were given to all the commanders engaged at Shiloh to

send in their reports without delay to department

headquarters.  Those from officers of the Army of the Tennessee

were sent through me; but from the Army of the Ohio they were

sent by General Buell without passing through my hands.  General

Halleck ordered me, verbally, to send in my report, but I

positively declined on the ground that he had received the

reports of a part of the army engaged at Shiloh without their

coming through me.  He admitted that my refusal was justifiable

under the circumstances, but explained that he had wanted to get

the reports off before moving the command, and as fast as a

report had come to him he had forwarded it to Washington.



Preparations were at once made upon the arrival of the new

commander for an advance on Corinth.  Owl Creek, on our right,

was bridged, and expeditions were sent to the north-west and

west to ascertain if our position was being threatened from

those quarters; the roads towards Corinth were corduroyed and

new ones made; lateral roads were also constructed, so that in

case of necessity troops marching by different routes could

reinforce each other.  All commanders were cautioned against

bringing on an engagement and informed in so many words that it

would be better to retreat than to fight.  By the 30th of April

all preparations were complete; the country west to the Mobile

and Ohio railroad had been reconnoitred, as well as the road to

Corinth as far as Monterey twelve miles from Pittsburg.

Everywhere small bodies of the enemy had been encountered, but

they were observers and not in force to fight battles.



Corinth, Mississippi, lies in a south-westerly direction from

Pittsburg landing and about nineteen miles away as the bird

would fly, but probably twenty-two by the nearest wagon-road. It

is about four miles south of the line dividing the States of

Tennessee and Mississippi, and at the junction of the

Mississippi and Chattanooga railroad with the Mobile and Ohio

road which runs from Columbus to Mobile.  From Pittsburg to

Corinth the land is rolling, but at no point reaching an

elevation that makes high hills to pass over.  In 1862 the

greater part of the country was covered with forest with

intervening clearings and houses.  Underbrush was dense in the

low grounds along the creeks and ravines, but generally not so

thick on the high land as to prevent men passing through with

ease.  There are two small creeks running from north of the town

and connecting some four miles south, where they form Bridge

Creek which empties into the Tuscumbia River.  Corinth is on the

ridge between these streams and is a naturally strong defensive

position.  The creeks are insignificant in volume of water, but

the stream to the east widens out in front of the town into a

swamp impassable in the presence of an enemy.  On the crest of

the west bank of this stream the enemy was strongly intrenched.



Corinth was a valuable strategic point for the enemy to hold,

and consequently a valuable one for us to possess ourselves

of.  We ought to have seized it immediately after the fall of

Donelson and Nashville, when it could have been taken without a

battle, but failing then it should have been taken, without

delay on the concentration of troops at Pittsburg landing after

the battle of Shiloh.  In fact the arrival of Pope should not

have been awaited.  There was no time from the battle of Shiloh

up to the evacuation of Corinth when the enemy would not have

left if pushed.  The demoralization among the Confederates from

their defeats at Henry and Donelson; their long marches from

Bowling Green, Columbus, and Nashville, and their failure at

Shiloh; in fact from having been driven out of Kentucky and

Tennessee, was so great that a stand for the time would have

been impossible.  Beauregard made strenuous efforts to reinforce

himself and partially succeeded.  He appealed to the people of

the South-west for new regiments, and received a few.  A. S.

Johnston had made efforts to reinforce in the same quarter,

before the battle of Shiloh, but in a different way.  He had

negroes sent out to him to take the place of teamsters, company

cooks and laborers in every capacity, so as to put all his white

men into the ranks.  The people, while willing to send their sons

to the field, were not willing to part with their negroes.  It is

only fair to state that they probably wanted their blacks to

raise supplies for the army and for the families left at home.



Beauregard, however, was reinforced by Van Dorn immediately

after Shiloh with 17,000 men.  Interior points, less exposed,

were also depleted to add to the strength at Corinth.  With

these reinforcements and the new regiments, Beauregard had,

during the month of May, 1862, a large force on paper, but

probably not much over 50,000 effective men.  We estimated his

strength at 70,000.  Our own was, in round numbers, 120,000. The

defensible nature of the ground at Corinth, and the

fortifications, made 50,000 then enough to maintain their

position against double that number for an indefinite time but

for the demoralization spoken of.



On the 30th of April the grand army commenced its advance from

Shiloh upon Corinth.  The movement was a siege from the start to

the close.  The National troops were always behind intrenchments,

except of course the small reconnoitring parties sent to the

front to clear the way for an advance.  Even the commanders of

these parties were cautioned, "not to bring on an engagement."

"It is better to retreat than to fight."  The enemy were

constantly watching our advance, but as they were simply

observers there were but few engagements that even threatened to

become battles.  All the engagements fought ought to have served

to encourage the enemy.  Roads were again made in our front, and

again corduroyed; a line was intrenched, and the troops were

advanced to the new position.  Cross roads were constructed to

these new positions to enable the troops to concentrate in case

of attack.  The National armies were thoroughly intrenched all

the way from the Tennessee River to Corinth.



For myself I was little more than an observer.  Orders were sent

direct to the right wing or reserve, ignoring me, and advances

were made from one line of intrenchments to another without

notifying me.  My position was so embarrassing in fact that I

made several applications during the siege to be relieved.



General Halleck kept his headquarters generally, if not all the

time, with the right wing.  Pope being on the extreme left did

not see so much of his chief, and consequently got loose as it

were at times.  On the 3d of May he was at Seven Mile Creek with

the main body of his command, but threw forward a division to

Farmington, within four miles of Corinth.  His troops had quite

a little engagement at Farmington on that day, but carried the

place with considerable loss to the enemy.  There would then

have been no difficulty in advancing the centre and right so as

to form a new line well up to the enemy, but Pope was ordered

back to conform with the general line.  On the 8th of May he

moved again, taking his whole force to Farmington, and pushed

out two divisions close to the rebel line.  Again he was ordered

back.  By the 4th of May the centre and right wing reached

Monterey, twelve miles out.  Their advance was slow from there,

for they intrenched with every forward movement.  The left wing

moved up again on the 25th of May and intrenched itself close to

the enemy.  The creek with the marsh before described, separated

the two lines.  Skirmishers thirty feet apart could have

maintained either line at this point.



Our centre and right were, at this time, extended so that the

right of the right wing was probably five miles from Corinth and

four from the works in their front.  The creek, which was a

formidable obstacle for either side to pass on our left, became

a very slight obstacle on our right.  Here the enemy occupied

two positions.  One of them, as much as two miles out from his

main line, was on a commanding elevation and defended by an

intrenched battery with infantry supports.  A heavy wood

intervened between this work and the National forces.  In rear

to the south there was a clearing extending a mile or more, and

south of this clearing a log-house which had been loop-holed and

was occupied by infantry.  Sherman's division carried these two

positions with some loss to himself, but with probably greater

to the enemy, on the 28th of May, and on that day the investment

of Corinth was complete, or as complete as it was ever made.

Thomas' right now rested west of the Mobile and Ohio railroad.

Pope's left commanded the Memphis and Charleston railroad east

of Corinth.



Some days before I had suggested to the commanding general that

I thought if he would move the Army of the Mississippi at night,

by the rear of the centre and right, ready to advance at

daylight, Pope would find no natural obstacle in his front and,

I believed, no serious artificial one.  The ground, or works,

occupied by our left could be held by a thin picket line, owing

to the stream and swamp in front.  To the right the troops would

have a dry ridge to march over.  I was silenced so quickly that I

felt that possibly I had suggested an unmilitary movement.



Later, probably on the 28th of May, General Logan, whose command

was then on the Mobile and Ohio railroad, said to me that the

enemy had been evacuating for several days and that if allowed

he could go into Corinth with his brigade.  Trains of cars were

heard coming in and going out of Corinth constantly.  Some of

the men who had been engaged in various capacities on railroads

before the war claimed that they could tell, by putting their

ears to the rail, not only which way the trains were moving but

which trains were loaded and which were empty.  They said loaded

trains had been going out for several days and empty ones coming

in.  Subsequent events proved the correctness of their

judgment.  Beauregard published his orders for the evacuation of

Corinth on the 26th of May and fixed the 29th for the departure

of his troops, and on the 30th of May General Halleck had his

whole army drawn up prepared for battle and announced in orders

that there was every indication that our left was to be attacked

that morning.  Corinth had already been evacuated and the

National troops marched on and took possession without

opposition.  Everything had been destroyed or carried away.  The

Confederate commander had instructed his soldiers to cheer on the

arrival of every train to create the impression among the Yankees

that reinforcements were arriving.  There was not a sick or

wounded man left by the Confederates, nor stores of any kind.

Some ammunition had been blown up--not removed--but the trophies

of war were a few Quaker guns, logs of about the diameter of

ordinary cannon, mounted on wheels of wagons and pointed in the

most threatening manner towards us.



The possession of Corinth by the National troops was of

strategic importance, but the victory was barren in every other

particular.  It was nearly bloodless.  It is a question whether

the MORALE of the Confederate troops engaged at Corinth was not

improved by the immunity with which they were permitted to

remove all public property and then withdraw themselves.  On our

side I know officers and men of the Army of the Tennessee--and I

presume the same is true of those of the other commands--were

disappointed at the result.  They could not see how the mere

occupation of places was to close the war while large and

effective rebel armies existed.  They believed that a well-

directed attack would at least have partially destroyed the army

defending Corinth.  For myself I am satisfied that Corinth could

have been captured in a two days' campaign commenced promptly on

the arrival of reinforcements after the battle of Shiloh.



General Halleck at once commenced erecting fortifications around

Corinth on a scale to indicate that this one point must be held

if it took the whole National army to do it.  All commanding

points two or three miles to the south, south-east and

south-west were strongly fortified.  It was expected in case of

necessity to connect these forts by rifle-pits.  They were laid

out on a scale that would have required 100,000 men to fully man

them.  It was probably thought that a final battle of the war

would be fought at that point.  These fortifications were never

used.  Immediately after the occupation of Corinth by the

National troops, General Pope was sent in pursuit of the

retreating garrison and General Buell soon followed.  Buell was

the senior of the two generals and commanded the entire

column.  The pursuit was kept up for some thirty miles, but did

not result in the capture of any material of war or prisoners,

unless a few stragglers who had fallen behind and were willing

captives.  On the 10th of June the pursuing column was all back

at Corinth.  The Army of the Tennessee was not engaged in any of

these movements.



The Confederates were now driven out of West Tennessee, and on

the 6th of June, after a well-contested naval battle, the

National forces took possession of Memphis and held the

Mississippi river from its source to that point.  The railroad

from Columbus to Corinth was at once put in good condition and

held by us.  We had garrisons at Donelson, Clarksville and

Nashville, on the Cumberland River, and held the Tennessee River

from its mouth to Eastport.  New Orleans and Baton Rouge had

fallen into the possession of the National forces, so that now

the Confederates at the west were narrowed down for all

communication with Richmond to the single line of road running

east from Vicksburg.  To dispossess them of this, therefore,

became a matter of the first importance.  The possession of the

Mississippi by us from Memphis to Baton Rouge was also a most

important object.  It would be equal to the amputation of a limb

in its weakening effects upon the enemy.



After the capture of Corinth a movable force of 80,000 men,

besides enough to hold all the territory acquired, could have

been set in motion for the accomplishment of any great campaign

for the suppression of the rebellion.  In addition to this fresh

troops were being raised to swell the effective force.  But the

work of depletion commenced.  Buell with the Army of the Ohio

was sent east, following the line of the Memphis and Charleston

railroad.  This he was ordered to repair as he advanced--only to

have it destroyed by small guerilla bands or other troops as soon

as he was out of the way.  If he had been sent directly to

Chattanooga as rapidly as he could march, leaving two or three

divisions along the line of the railroad from Nashville forward,

he could have arrived with but little fighting, and would have

saved much of the loss of life which was afterwards incurred in

gaining Chattanooga.  Bragg would then not have had time to

raise an army to contest the possession of middle and east

Tennessee and Kentucky; the battles of Stone River and

Chickamauga would not necessarily have been fought; Burnside

would not have been besieged in Knoxville without the power of

helping himself or escaping; the battle of Chattanooga would not

have been fought.  These are the negative advantages, if the term

negative is applicable, which would probably have resulted from

prompt movements after Corinth fell into the possession of the

National forces.  The positive results might have been:  a

bloodless advance to Atlanta, to Vicksburg, or to any other

desired point south of Corinth in the interior of Mississippi.
