PROMOTION TO FIRST LIEUTENANT--CAPTURE OF THE CITY OF

MEXICO--THE ARMY--MEXICAN SOLDIERS--PEACE NEGOTIATIONS.



On entering the city the troops were fired upon by the released

convicts, and possibly by deserters and hostile citizens.  The

streets were deserted, and the place presented the appearance of

a "city of the dead," except for this firing by unseen persons

from house-tops, windows, and around corners.  In this firing

the lieutenant-colonel of my regiment, Garland, was badly

wounded, Lieutenant Sidney Smith, of the 4th infantry, was also

wounded mortally.  He died a few days after, and by his death I

was promoted to the grade of first lieutenant.(*4)  I had gone

into the battle of Palo Alto in May, 1846, a second lieutenant,

and I entered the city of Mexico sixteen months later with the

same rank, after having been in all the engagements possible for

any one man and in a regiment that lost more officers during the

war than it ever had present at any one engagement.  My regiment

lost four commissioned officers, all senior to me, by steamboat

explosions during the Mexican war.  The Mexicans were not so

discriminating.  They sometimes picked off my juniors.



General Scott soon followed the troops into the city, in

state.  I wonder that he was not fired upon, but I believe he

was not; at all events he was not hurt.  He took quarters at

first in the "Halls of the Montezumas," and from there issued

his wise and discreet orders for the government of a conquered

city, and for suppressing the hostile acts of liberated convicts

already spoken of--orders which challenge the respect of all who

study them.  Lawlessness was soon suppressed, and the City of

Mexico settled down into a quiet, law-abiding place.  The people

began to make their appearance upon the streets without fear of

the invaders.  Shortly afterwards the bulk of the troops were

sent from the city to the villages at the foot of the mountains,

four or five miles to the south and south-west.



Whether General Scott approved of the Mexican war and the manner

in which it was brought about, I have no means of knowing.  His

orders to troops indicate only a soldierly spirit, with probably

a little regard for the perpetuation of his own fame.  On the

other hand, General Taylor's, I think, indicate that he

considered the administration accountable for the war, and felt

no responsibility resting on himself further than for the

faithful performance of his duties.  Both generals deserve the

commendations of their countrymen and to live in the grateful

memory of this people to the latest generation.



Earlier in this narrative I have stated that the plain, reached

after passing the mountains east of Perote, extends to the

cities of Puebla and Mexico.  The route travelled by the army

before reaching Puebla, goes over a pass in a spur of mountain

coming up from the south.  This pass is very susceptible of

defence by a smaller against a larger force.  Again, the highest

point of the road-bed between Vera Cruz and the City of Mexico is

over Rio Frio mountain, which also might have been successfully

defended by an inferior against a superior force.  But by moving

north of the mountains, and about thirty miles north of Puebla,

both of these passes would have been avoided.  The road from

Perote to the City of Mexico, by this latter route, is as level

as the prairies in our West.  Arriving due north from Puebla,

troops could have been detached to take possession of that

place, and then proceeding west with the rest of the army no

mountain would have been encountered before reaching the City of

Mexico.  It is true this road would have brought troops in by

Guadalupe--a town, church and detached spur of mountain about

two miles north of the capital, all bearing the same general

name--and at this point Lake Texcoco comes near to the mountain,

which was fortified both at the base and on the sides:  but

troops could have passed north of the mountain and come in only

a few miles to the north-west, and so flanked the position, as

they actually did on the south.



It has always seemed to me that this northern route to the City

of Mexico, would have been the better one to have taken.  But my

later experience has taught me two lessons:  first, that things

are seen plainer after the events have occurred; second, that

the most confident critics are generally those who know the

least about the matter criticised.  I know just enough about the

Mexican war to approve heartily of most of the generalship, but

to differ with a little of it.  It is natural that an important

city like Puebla should not have been passed with contempt; it

may be natural that the direct road to it should have been

taken; but it could have been passed, its evacuation insured and

possession acquired without danger of encountering the enemy in

intricate mountain defiles.  In this same way the City of Mexico

could have been approached without any danger of opposition,

except in the open field.



But General Scott's successes are an answer to all criticism. He

invaded a populous country, penetrating two hundred and sixty

miles into the interior, with a force at no time equal to

one-half of that opposed to him; he was without a base; the

enemy was always intrenched, always on the defensive; yet he won

every battle, he captured the capital, and conquered the

government.  Credit is due to the troops engaged, it is true,

but the plans and the strategy were the general's.



I had now made marches and been in battle under both General

Scott and General Taylor.  The former divided his force of

10,500 men into four columns, starting a day apart, in moving

from Puebla to the capital of the nation, when it was known that

an army more than twice as large as his own stood ready to resist

his coming.  The road was broad and the country open except in

crossing the Rio Frio mountain.  General Taylor pursued the same

course in marching toward an enemy.  He moved even in smaller

bodies.  I never thought at the time to doubt the infallibility

of these two generals in all matters pertaining to their

profession.  I supposed they moved in small bodies because more

men could not be passed over a single road on the same day with

their artillery and necessary trains.  Later I found the fallacy

of this belief.  The rebellion, which followed as a sequence to

the Mexican war, never could have been suppressed if larger

bodies of men could not have been moved at the same time than

was the custom under Scott and Taylor.



The victories in Mexico were, in every instance, over vastly

superior numbers.  There were two reasons for this.  Both

General Scott and General Taylor had such armies as are not

often got together.  At the battles of Palo Alto and

Resaca-de-la-Palma, General Taylor had a small army, but it was

composed exclusively of regular troops, under the best of drill

and discipline.  Every officer, from the highest to the lowest,

was educated in his profession, not at West Point necessarily,

but in the camp, in garrison, and many of them in Indian wars.

The rank and file were probably inferior, as material out of

which to make an army, to the volunteers that participated in

all the later battles of the war; but they were brave men, and

then drill and discipline brought out all there was in them.  A

better army, man for man, probably never faced an enemy than the

one commanded by General Taylor in the earliest two engagements

of the Mexican war.  The volunteers who followed were of better

material, but without drill or discipline at the start.  They

were associated with so many disciplined men and professionally

educated officers, that when they went into engagements it was

with a confidence they would not have felt otherwise.  They

became soldiers themselves almost at once.  All these conditions

we would enjoy again in case of war.



The Mexican army of that day was hardly an organization.  The

private soldier was picked up from the lower class of the

inhabitants when wanted; his consent was not asked; he was

poorly clothed, worse fed, and seldom paid.  He was turned

adrift when no longer wanted.  The officers of the lower grades

were but little superior to the men.  With all this I have seen

as brave stands made by some of these men as I have ever seen

made by soldiers.  Now Mexico has a standing army larger than

that of the United States.  They have a military school modelled

after West Point.  Their officers are educated and, no doubt,

generally brave.  The Mexican war of 1846-8 would be an

impossibility in this generation.



The Mexicans have shown a patriotism which it would be well if

we would imitate in part, but with more regard to truth.  They

celebrate the anniversaries of Chapultepec and Molino del Rey as

of very great victories.  The anniversaries are recognized as

national holidays.  At these two battles, while the United

States troops were victorious, it was at very great sacrifice of

life compared with what the Mexicans suffered.  The Mexicans, as

on many other occasions, stood up as well as any troops ever

did.  The trouble seemed to be the lack of experience among the

officers, which led them after a certain time to simply quit,

without being particularly whipped, but because they had fought

enough.  Their authorities of the present day grow enthusiastic

over their theme when telling of these victories, and speak with

pride of the large sum of money they forced us to pay in the

end.  With us, now twenty years after the close of the most

stupendous war ever known, we have writers--who profess devotion

to the nation--engaged in trying to prove that the Union forces

were not victorious; practically, they say, we were slashed

around from Donelson to Vicksburg and to Chattanooga; and in the

East from Gettysburg to Appomattox, when the physical rebellion

gave out from sheer exhaustion.  There is no difference in the

amount of romance in the two stories.



I would not have the anniversaries of our victories celebrated,

nor those of our defeats made fast days and spent in humiliation

and prayer; but I would like to see truthful history written.

Such history will do full credit to the courage, endurance and

soldierly ability of the American citizen, no matter what

section of the country he hailed from, or in what ranks he

fought.  The justice of the cause which in the end prevailed,

will, I doubt not, come to be acknowledged by every citizen of

the land, in time.  For the present, and so long as there are

living witnesses of the great war of sections, there will be

people who will not be consoled for the loss of a cause which

they believed to be holy.  As time passes, people, even of the

South, will begin to wonder how it was possible that their

ancestors ever fought for or justified institutions which

acknowledged the right of property in man.



After the fall of the capital and the dispersal of the

government of Mexico, it looked very much as if military

occupation of the country for a long time might be necessary.

General Scott at once began the preparation of orders,

regulations and laws in view of this contingency.  He

contemplated making the country pay all the expenses of the

occupation, without the army becoming a perceptible burden upon

the people.  His plan was to levy a direct tax upon the separate

states, and collect, at the ports left open to trade, a duty on

all imports.  From the beginning of the war private property had

not been taken, either for the use of the army or of individuals,

without full compensation.  This policy was to be pursued.  There

were not troops enough in the valley of Mexico to occupy many

points, but now that there was no organized army of the enemy of

any size, reinforcements could be got from the Rio Grande, and

there were also new volunteers arriving from time to time, all

by way of Vera Cruz.  Military possession was taken of

Cuernavaca, fifty miles south of the City of Mexico; of Toluca,

nearly as far west, and of Pachuca, a mining town of great

importance, some sixty miles to the north-east.  Vera Cruz,

Jalapa, Orizaba, and Puebla were already in our possession.



Meanwhile the Mexican government had departed in the person of

Santa Anna, and it looked doubtful for a time whether the United

States commissioner, Mr. Trist, would find anybody to negotiate

with.  A temporary government, however, was soon established at

Queretaro, and Trist began negotiations for a conclusion of the

war.  Before terms were finally agreed upon he was ordered back

to Washington, but General Scott prevailed upon him to remain,

as an arrangement had been so nearly reached, and the

administration must approve his acts if he succeeded in making

such a treaty as had been contemplated in his instructions.  The

treaty was finally signed the 2d of February, 1848, and accepted

by the government at Washington.  It is that known as the

"Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo," and secured to the United States

the Rio Grande as the boundary of Texas, and the whole territory

then included in New Mexico and Upper California, for the sum of

$15,000,000.



Soon after entering the city of Mexico, the opposition of

Generals Pillow, Worth and Colonel Duncan to General Scott

became very marked.  Scott claimed that they had demanded of the

President his removal.  I do not know whether this is so or not,

but I do know of their unconcealed hostility to their chief.  At

last he placed them in arrest, and preferred charges against them

of insubordination and disrespect.  This act brought on a crisis

in the career of the general commanding.  He had asserted from

the beginning that the administration was hostile to him; that

it had failed in its promises of men and war material; that the

President himself had shown duplicity if not treachery in the

endeavor to procure the appointment of Benton:  and the

administration now gave open evidence of its enmity.  About the

middle of February orders came convening a court of inquiry,

composed of Brevet Brigadier-General Towson, the

paymaster-general of the army, Brigadier-General Cushing and

Colonel Belknap, to inquire into the conduct of the accused and

the accuser, and shortly afterwards orders were received from

Washington, relieving Scott of the command of the army in the

field and assigning Major-General William O. Butler of Kentucky

to the place.  This order also released Pillow, Worth and Duncan

from arrest.



If a change was to be made the selection of General Butler was

agreeable to every one concerned, so far as I remember to have

heard expressions on the subject.  There were many who regarded

the treatment of General Scott as harsh and unjust.  It is quite

possible that the vanity of the General had led him to say and do

things that afforded a plausible pretext to the administration

for doing just what it did and what it had wanted to do from the

start.  The court tried the accuser quite as much as the

accused.  It was adjourned before completing its labors, to meet

in Frederick, Maryland.  General Scott left the country, and

never after had more than the nominal command of the army until

early in 1861.  He certainly was not sustained in his efforts to

maintain discipline in high places.



The efforts to kill off politically the two successful generals,

made them both candidates for the Presidency.  General Taylor was

nominated in 1848, and was elected.  Four years later General

Scott received the nomination but was badly beaten, and the

party nominating him died with his defeat.(*5)
