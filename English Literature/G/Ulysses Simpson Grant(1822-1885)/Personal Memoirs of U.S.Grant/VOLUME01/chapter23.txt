PROMOTED MAJOR-GENERAL OF VOLUNTEERS--UNOCCUPIED

TERRITORY--ADVANCE UPON NASHVILLE--SITUATION OF THE

TROOPS--CONFEDERATE RETREAT--RELIEVED OF THE COMMAND --RESTORED

TO THE COMMAND--GENERAL SMITH.



The news of the fall of Fort Donelson caused great delight all

over the North.  At the South, particularly in Richmond, the

effect was correspondingly depressing.  I was promptly promoted

to the grade of Major-General of Volunteers, and confirmed by

the Senate.  All three of my division commanders were promoted

to the same grade and the colonels who commanded brigades were

made brigadier-generals in the volunteer service.  My chief, who

was in St. Louis, telegraphed his congratulations to General

Hunter in Kansas for the services he had rendered in securing

the fall of Fort Donelson by sending reinforcements so

rapidly.  To Washington he telegraphed that the victory was due

to General C. F. Smith; "promote him," he said, "and the whole

country will applaud."  On the 19th there was published at St.

Louis a formal order thanking Flag-officer Foote and myself, and

the forces under our command, for the victories on the Tennessee

and the Cumberland.  I received no other recognition whatever

from General Halleck.  But General Cullum, his chief of staff,

who was at Cairo, wrote me a warm congratulatory letter on his

own behalf.  I approved of General Smith's promotion highly, as

I did all the promotions that were made.



My opinion was and still is that immediately after the fall of

Fort Donelson the way was opened to the National forces all over

the South-west without much resistance.  If one general who would

have taken the responsibility had been in command of all the

troops west of the Alleghanies, he could have marched to

Chattanooga, Corinth, Memphis and Vicksburg with the troops we

then had, and as volunteering was going on rapidly over the

North there would soon have been force enough at all these

centres to operate offensively against any body of the enemy

that might be found near them.  Rapid movements and the

acquisition of rebellious territory would have promoted

volunteering, so that reinforcements could have been had as fast

as transportation could have been obtained to carry them to their

destination.  On the other hand there were tens of thousands of

strong able-bodied young men still at their homes in the

South-western States, who had not gone into the Confederate army

in February, 1862, and who had no particular desire to go.  If

our lines had been extended to protect their homes, many of them

never would have gone.  Providence ruled differently.  Time was

given the enemy to collect armies and fortify his new positions;

and twice afterwards he came near forcing his north-western front

up to the Ohio River.



I promptly informed the department commander of our success at

Fort Donelson and that the way was open now to Clarksville and

Nashville; and that unless I received orders to the contrary I

should take Clarksville on the 21st and Nashville about the 1st

of March.  Both these places are on the Cumberland River above

Fort Donelson.  As I heard nothing from headquarters on the

subject, General C. F. Smith was sent to Clarksville at the time

designated and found the place evacuated.  The capture of forts

Henry and Donelson had broken the line the enemy had taken from

Columbus to Bowling Green, and it was known that he was falling

back from the eastern point of this line and that Buell was

following, or at least advancing.  I should have sent troops to

Nashville at the time I sent to Clarksville, but my

transportation was limited and there were many prisoners to be

forwarded north.



None of the reinforcements from Buell's army arrived until the

24th of February.  Then General Nelson came up, with orders to

report to me with two brigades, he having sent one brigade to

Cairo.  I knew General Buell was advancing on Nashville from the

north, and I was advised by scouts that the rebels were leaving

that place, and trying to get out all the supplies they could.

Nashville was, at that time, one of the best provisioned posts

in the South.  I had no use for reinforcements now, and thinking

Buell would like to have his troops again, I ordered Nelson to

proceed to Nashville without debarking at Fort Donelson.  I sent

a gunboat also as a convoy.  The Cumberland River was very high

at the time; the railroad bridge at Nashville had been burned,

and all river craft had been destroyed, or would be before the

enemy left.  Nashville is on the west bank of the Cumberland,

and Buell was approaching from the east.  I thought the steamers

carrying Nelson's division would be useful in ferrying the

balance of Buell's forces across.  I ordered Nelson to put

himself in communication with Buell as soon as possible, and if

he found him more than two days off from Nashville to return

below the city and await orders.  Buell, however, had already

arrived in person at Edgefield, opposite Nashville, and

Mitchell's division of his command reached there the same day.

Nelson immediately took possession of the city.



After Nelson had gone and before I had learned of Buell's

arrival, I sent word to department headquarters that I should go

to Nashville myself on the 28th if I received no orders to the

contrary.  Hearing nothing, I went as I had informed my superior

officer I would do.  On arriving at Clarksville I saw a fleet of

steamers at the shore--the same that had taken Nelson's

division--and troops going aboard.  I landed and called on the

commanding officer, General C. F. Smith.  As soon as he saw me

he showed an order he had just received from Buell in these

words:





NASHVILLE, February 25, 1862.



GENERAL C. F. SMITH,

Commanding U. S. Forces, Clarksville.



GENERAL:--The landing of a portion of our troops, contrary to my

intentions, on the south side of the river has compelled me to

hold this side at every hazard.  If the enemy should assume the

offensive, and I am assured by reliable persons that in view of

my position such is his intention, my force present is

altogether inadequate, consisting of only 15,000 men.  I have to

request you, therefore, to come forward with all the available

force under your command.  So important do I consider the

occasion that I think it necessary to give this communication

all the force of orders, and I send four boats, the Diana,

Woodford, John Rain, and Autocrat, to bring you up.  In five or

six days my force will probably be sufficient to relieve you.



Very respectfully, your ob't srv't,

D. C. BUELL,

Brigadier-General Comd'g.



P. S.--The steamers will leave here at 12 o'clock to-night.





General Smith said this order was nonsense.  But I told him it

was better to obey it.  The General replied, "of course I must

obey," and said his men were embarking as fast as they could.  I

went on up to Nashville and inspected the position taken by

Nelson's troops.  I did not see Buell during the day, and wrote

him a note saying that I had been in Nashville since early

morning and had hoped to meet him.  On my return to the boat we

met.  His troops were still east of the river, and the steamers

that had carried Nelson's division up were mostly at Clarksville

to bring Smith's division.  I said to General Buell my

information was that the enemy was retreating as fast as

possible.  General Buell said there was fighting going on then

only ten or twelve miles away.  I said:  "Quite probably;

Nashville contained valuable stores of arms, ammunition and

provisions, and the enemy is probably trying to carry away all

he can.  The fighting is doubtless with the rear-guard who are

trying to protect the trains they are getting away with."  Buell

spoke very positively of the danger Nashville was in of an attack

from the enemy.  I said, in the absence of positive information,

I believed my information was correct.  He responded that he

"knew."  "Well," I said, "I do not know; but as I came by

Clarksville General Smith's troops were embarking to join you."



Smith's troops were returned the same day.  The enemy were

trying to get away from Nashville and not to return to it.



At this time General Albert Sidney Johnston commanded all the

Confederate troops west of the Alleghany Mountains, with the

exception of those in the extreme south.  On the National side

the forces confronting him were divided into, at first three,

then four separate departments.  Johnston had greatly the

advantage in having supreme command over all troops that could

possibly be brought to bear upon one point, while the forces

similarly situated on the National side, divided into

independent commands, could not be brought into harmonious

action except by orders from Washington.



At the beginning of 1862 Johnston's troops east of the

Mississippi occupied a line extending from Columbus, on his

left, to Mill Springs, on his right.  As we have seen, Columbus,

both banks of the Tennessee River, the west bank of the

Cumberland and Bowling Green, all were strongly fortified.  Mill

Springs was intrenched.  The National troops occupied no

territory south of the Ohio, except three small garrisons along

its bank and a force thrown out from Louisville to confront that

at Bowling Green.  Johnston's strength was no doubt numerically

inferior to that of the National troops; but this was

compensated for by the advantage of being sole commander of all

the Confederate forces at the West, and of operating in a

country where his friends would take care of his rear without

any detail of soldiers.  But when General George H. Thomas moved

upon the enemy at Mill Springs and totally routed him, inflicting

a loss of some 300 killed and wounded, and forts Henry and Heiman

fell into the hands of the National forces, with their armaments

and about 100 prisoners, those losses seemed to dishearten the

Confederate commander so much that he immediately commenced a

retreat from Bowling Green on Nashville.  He reached this latter

place on the 14th of February, while Donelson was still

besieged.  Buell followed with a portion of the Army of the

Ohio, but he had to march and did not reach the east bank of the

Cumberland opposite Nashville until the 24th of the month, and

then with only one division of his army.



The bridge at Nashville had been destroyed and all boats removed

or disabled, so that a small garrison could have held the place

against any National troops that could have been brought against

it within ten days after the arrival of the force from Bowling

Green.  Johnston seemed to lie quietly at Nashville to await the

result at Fort Donelson, on which he had staked the possession of

most of the territory embraced in the States of Kentucky and

Tennessee.  It is true, the two generals senior in rank at Fort

Donelson were sending him encouraging dispatches, even claiming

great Confederate victories up to the night of the 16th when

they must have been preparing for their individual escape.

Johnston made a fatal mistake in intrusting so important a

command to Floyd, who he must have known was no soldier even if

he possessed the elements of one.  Pillow's presence as second

was also a mistake.  If these officers had been forced upon him

and designated for that particular command, then he should have

left Nashville with a small garrison under a trusty officer, and

with the remainder of his force gone to Donelson himself.  If he

had been captured the result could not have been worse than it

was.



Johnston's heart failed him upon the first advance of National

troops.  He wrote to Richmond on the 8th of February, "I think

the gunboats of the enemy will probably take Fort Donelson

without the necessity of employing their land force in

cooperation."  After the fall of that place he abandoned

Nashville and Chattanooga without an effort to save either, and

fell back into northern Mississippi, where, six weeks later, he

was destined to end his career.



From the time of leaving Cairo I was singularly unfortunate in

not receiving dispatches from General Halleck.  The order of the

10th of February directing me to fortify Fort Henry strongly,

particularly to the land side, and saying that intrenching tools

had been sent for that purpose, reached me after Donelson was

invested.  I received nothing direct which indicated that the

department commander knew we were in possession of Donelson.  I

was reporting regularly to the chief of staff, who had been sent

to Cairo, soon after the troops left there, to receive all

reports from the front and to telegraph the substance to the St.

Louis headquarters.  Cairo was at the southern end of the

telegraph wire.  Another line was started at once from Cairo to

Paducah and Smithland, at the mouths of the Tennessee and

Cumberland respectively.  My dispatches were all sent to Cairo

by boat, but many of those addressed to me were sent to the

operator at the end of the advancing wire and he failed to

forward them.  This operator afterwards proved to be a rebel; he

deserted his post after a short time and went south taking his

dispatches with him.  A telegram from General McClellan to me of

February 16th, the day of the surrender, directing me to report

in full the situation, was not received at my headquarters until

the 3d of March.



On the 2d of March I received orders dated March 1st to move my

command back to Fort Henry, leaving only a small garrison at

Donelson.  From Fort Henry expeditions were to be sent against

Eastport, Mississippi, and Paris, Tennessee.  We started from

Donelson on the 4th, and the same day I was back on the

Tennessee River.  On March 4th I also received the following

dispatch from General Halleck:





MAJ.-GEN. U. S. GRANT,

Fort Henry:



You will place Maj.-Gen. C. F. Smith in command of expedition,

and remain yourself at Fort Henry.  Why do you not obey my

orders to report strength and positions of your command?



H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.





I was surprised.  This was the first intimation I had received

that General Halleck had called for information as to the

strength of my command.  On the 6th he wrote to me again.  "Your

going to Nashville without authority, and when your presence with

your troops was of the utmost importance, was a matter of very

serious complaint at Washington, so much so that I was advised

to arrest you on your return."  This was the first I knew of his

objecting to my going to Nashville.  That place was not beyond

the limits of my command, which, it had been expressly declared

in orders, were "not defined."  Nashville is west of the

Cumberland River, and I had sent troops that had reported to me

for duty to occupy the place.  I turned over the command as

directed and then replied to General Halleck courteously, but

asked to be relieved from further duty under him.



Later I learned that General Halleck had been calling lustily

for more troops, promising that he would do something important

if he could only be sufficiently reinforced.  McClellan asked

him what force he then had.  Halleck telegraphed me to supply

the information so far as my command was concerned, but I

received none of his dispatches.  At last Halleck reported to

Washington that he had repeatedly ordered me to give the

strength of my force, but could get nothing out of me; that I

had gone to Nashville, beyond the limits of my command, without

his authority, and that my army was more demoralized by victory

than the army at Bull Run had been by defeat.  General

McClellan, on this information, ordered that I should be

relieved from duty and that an investigation should be made into

any charges against me.  He even authorized my arrest.  Thus in

less than two weeks after the victory at Donelson, the two

leading generals in the army were in correspondence as to what

disposition should be made of me, and in less than three weeks I

was virtually in arrest and without a command.



On the 13th of March I was restored to command, and on the 17th

Halleck sent me a copy of an order from the War Department which

stated that accounts of my misbehavior had reached Washington and

directed him to investigate and report the facts.  He forwarded

also a copy of a detailed dispatch from himself to Washington

entirely exonerating me; but he did not inform me that it was

his own reports that had created all the trouble.  On the

contrary, he wrote to me, "Instead of relieving you, I wish you,

as soon as your new army is in the field, to assume immediate

command, and lead it to new victories."  In consequence I felt

very grateful to him, and supposed it was his interposition that

had set me right with the government.  I never knew the truth

until General Badeau unearthed the facts in his researches for

his history of my campaigns.



General Halleck unquestionably deemed General C. F. Smith a much

fitter officer for the command of all the forces in the military

district than I was, and, to render him available for such

command, desired his promotion to antedate mine and those of the

other division commanders.  It is probable that the general

opinion was that Smith's long services in the army and

distinguished deeds rendered him the more proper person for such

command.  Indeed I was rather inclined to this opinion myself at

that time, and would have served as faithfully under Smith as he

had done under me.  But this did not justify the dispatches which

General Halleck sent to Washington, or his subsequent concealment

of them from me when pretending to explain the action of my

superiors.



On receipt of the order restoring me to command I proceeded to

Savannah on the Tennessee, to which point my troops had

advanced.  General Smith was delighted to see me and was

unhesitating in his denunciation of the treatment I had

received.  He was on a sick bed at the time, from which he never

came away alive.  His death was a severe loss to our western

army.  His personal courage was unquestioned, his judgment and

professional acquirements were unsurpassed, and he had the

confidence of those he commanded as well as of those over him.
