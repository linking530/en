SIEGE OF VICKSBURG.



I now determined upon a regular siege--to "out-camp the enemy,"

as it were, and to incur no more losses.  The experience of the

22d convinced officers and men that this was best, and they went

to work on the defences and approaches with a will.  With the

navy holding the river, the investment of Vicksburg was

complete.  As long as we could hold our position the enemy was

limited in supplies of food, men and munitions of war to what

they had on hand.  These could not last always.



The crossing of troops at Bruinsburg commenced April 30th.  On

the 18th of May the army was in rear of Vicksburg.  On the 19th,

just twenty days after the crossing, the city was completely

invested and an assault had been made:  five distinct battles

(besides continuous skirmishing) had been fought and won by the

Union forces; the capital of the State had fallen and its

arsenals, military manufactories and everything useful for

military purposes had been destroyed; an average of about one

hundred and eighty miles had been marched by the troops engaged;

but five days' rations had been issued, and no forage; over six

thousand prisoners had been captured, and as many more of the

enemy had been killed or wounded; twenty-seven heavy cannon and

sixty-one field-pieces had fallen into our hands; and four

hundred miles of the river, from Vicksburg to Port Hudson, had

become ours.  The Union force that had crossed the Mississippi

River up to this time was less than forty-three thousand men.

One division of these, Blair's, only arrived in time to take

part in the battle of Champion's Hill, but was not engaged

there; and one brigade, Ransom's of McPherson's corps, reached

the field after the battle.  The enemy had at Vicksburg, Grand

Gulf, Jackson, and on the roads between these places, over sixty

thousand men.  They were in their own country, where no rear

guards were necessary.  The country is admirable for defence,

but difficult for the conduct of an offensive campaign.  All

their troops had to be met.  We were fortunate, to say the

least, in meeting them in detail:  at Port Gibson seven or eight

thousand; at Raymond, five thousand; at Jackson, from eight to

eleven thousand; at Champion's Hill, twenty-five thousand; at

the Big Black, four thousand.  A part of those met at Jackson

were all that was left of those encountered at Raymond.  They

were beaten in detail by a force smaller than their own, upon

their own ground.  Our loss up to this time was:

Of the wounded many were but slightly so, and continued on

duty.  Not half of them were disabled for any length of time.



After the unsuccessful assault of the 22d the work of the

regular siege began.  Sherman occupied the right starting from

the river above Vicksburg, McPherson the centre (McArthur's

division now with him) and McClernand the left, holding the road

south to Warrenton.  Lauman's division arrived at this time and

was placed on the extreme left of the line.



In the interval between the assaults of the 19th and 22d, roads

had been completed from the Yazoo River and Chickasaw Bayou,

around the rear of the army, to enable us to bring up supplies

of food and ammunition; ground had been selected and cleared on

which the troops were to be encamped, and tents and cooking

utensils were brought up.  The troops had been without these

from the time of crossing the Mississippi up to this time.  All

was now ready for the pick and spade.  Prentiss and Hurlbut were

ordered to send forward every man that could be spared.  Cavalry

especially was wanted to watch the fords along the Big Black,

and to observe Johnston.  I knew that Johnston was receiving

reinforcements from Bragg, who was confronting Rosecrans in

Tennessee.  Vicksburg was so important to the enemy that I

believed he would make the most strenuous efforts to raise the

siege, even at the risk of losing ground elsewhere.



My line was more than fifteen miles long, extending from Haines'

Bluff to Vicksburg, thence to Warrenton.  The line of the enemy

was about seven.  In addition to this, having an enemy at Canton

and Jackson, in our rear, who was being constantly reinforced, we

required a second line of defence facing the other way.  I had

not troops enough under my command to man these.  General

Halleck appreciated the situation and, without being asked,

forwarded reinforcements with all possible dispatch.



The ground about Vicksburg is admirable for defence.  On the

north it is about two hundred feet above the Mississippi River

at the highest point and very much cut up by the washing rains;

the ravines were grown up with cane and underbrush, while the

sides and tops were covered with a dense forest.  Farther south

the ground flattens out somewhat, and was in cultivation.  But

here, too, it was cut up by ravines and small streams.  The

enemy's line of defence followed the crest of a ridge from the

river north of the city eastward, then southerly around to the

Jackson road, full three miles back of the city; thence in a

southwesterly direction to the river.  Deep ravines of the

description given lay in front of these defences.  As there is a

succession of gullies, cut out by rains along the side of the

ridge, the line was necessarily very irregular.  To follow each

of these spurs with intrenchments, so as to command the slopes

on either side, would have lengthened their line very much.

Generally therefore, or in many places, their line would run

from near the head of one gully nearly straight to the head of

another, and an outer work triangular in shape, generally open

in the rear, was thrown up on the point; with a few men in this

outer work they commanded the approaches to the main line

completely.



The work to be done, to make our position as strong against the

enemy as his was against us, was very great.  The problem was

also complicated by our wanting our line as near that of the

enemy as possible.  We had but four engineer officers with us.

Captain Prime, of the Engineer Corps, was the chief, and the

work at the beginning was mainly directed by him.  His health

soon gave out, when he was succeeded by Captain Comstock, also

of the Engineer Corps.  To provide assistants on such a long

line I directed that all officers who had graduated at West

Point, where they had necessarily to study military engineering,

should in addition to their other duties assist in the work.



The chief quartermaster and the chief commissary were

graduates.  The chief commissary, now the Commissary-General of

the Army, begged off, however, saying that there was nothing in

engineering that he was good for unless he would do for a

sap-roller.  As soldiers require rations while working in the

ditches as well as when marching and fighting, and as we would

be sure to lose him if he was used as a sap-roller, I let him

off.  The general is a large man; weighs two hundred and twenty

pounds, and is not tall.



We had no siege guns except six thirty-two pounders, and there

were none at the West to draw from.  Admiral Porter, however,

supplied us with a battery of navy-guns of large calibre, and

with these, and the field artillery used in the campaign, the

siege began.  The first thing to do was to get the artillery in

batteries where they would occupy commanding positions; then

establish the camps, under cover from the fire of the enemy but

as near up as possible; and then construct rifle-pits and

covered ways, to connect the entire command by the shortest

route.  The enemy did not harass us much while we were

constructing our batteries.  Probably their artillery ammunition

was short; and their infantry was kept down by our sharpshooters,

who were always on the alert and ready to fire at a head whenever

it showed itself above the rebel works.



In no place were our lines more than six hundred yards from the

enemy.  It was necessary, therefore, to cover our men by

something more than the ordinary parapet.  To give additional

protection sand bags, bullet-proof, were placed along the tops

of the parapets far enough apart to make loop-holes for

musketry.  On top of these, logs were put.  By these means the

men were enabled to walk about erect when off duty, without fear

of annoyance from sharpshooters.  The enemy used in their defence

explosive musket-balls, no doubt thinking that, bursting over our

men in the trenches, they would do some execution; but I do not

remember a single case where a man was injured by a piece of one

of these shells.  When they were hit and the ball exploded, the

wound was terrible.  In these cases a solid ball would have hit

as well.  Their use is barbarous, because they produce increased

suffering without any corresponding advantage to those using

them.



The enemy could not resort to our method to protect their men,

because we had an inexhaustible supply of ammunition to draw

upon and used it freely.  Splinters from the timber would have

made havoc among the men behind.



There were no mortars with the besiegers, except what the navy

had in front of the city; but wooden ones were made by taking

logs of the toughest wood that could be found, boring them out

for six or twelve pound shells and binding them with strong iron

bands.  These answered as cochorns, and shells were successfully

thrown from them into the trenches of the enemy.



The labor of building the batteries and intrenching was largely

done by the pioneers, assisted by negroes who came within our

lines and who were paid for their work; but details from the

troops had often to be made.  The work was pushed forward as

rapidly as possible, and when an advanced position was secured

and covered from the fire of the enemy the batteries were

advanced.  By the 3oth of June there were two hundred and twenty

guns in position, mostly light field-pieces, besides a battery of

heavy guns belonging to, manned and commanded by the navy.  We

were now as strong for defence against the garrison of Vicksburg

as they were against us; but I knew that Johnston was in our

rear, and was receiving constant reinforcements from the east.

He had at this time a larger force than I had had at any time

prior to the battle of Champion's Hill.



As soon as the news of the arrival of the Union army behind

Vicksburg reached the North, floods of visitors began to pour

in.  Some came to gratify curiosity; some to see sons or

brothers who had passed through the terrible ordeal; members of

the Christian and Sanitary Associations came to minister to the

wants of the sick and the wounded.  Often those coming to see a

son or brother would bring a dozen or two of poultry.  They did

not know how little the gift would be appreciated.  Many of the

soldiers had lived so much on chickens, ducks and turkeys

without bread during the march, that the sight of poultry, if

they could get bacon, almost took away their appetite.  But the

intention was good.



Among the earliest arrivals was the Governor of Illinois, with

most of the State officers.  I naturally wanted to show them

what there was of most interest.  In Sherman's front the ground

was the most broken and most wooded, and more was to be seen

without exposure.  I therefore took them to Sherman's

headquarters and presented them.  Before starting out to look at

the lines--possibly while Sherman's horse was being

saddled--there were many questions asked about the late

campaign, about which the North had been so imperfectly

informed.  There was a little knot around Sherman and another

around me, and I heard Sherman repeating, in the most animated

manner, what he had said to me when we first looked down from

Walnut Hills upon the land below on the 18th of May, adding:

"Grant is entitled to every bit of the credit for the campaign;

I opposed it.  I wrote him a letter about it."  But for this

speech it is not likely that Sherman's opposition would have

ever been heard of.  His untiring energy and great efficiency

during the campaign entitle him to a full share of all the

credit due for its success.  He could not have done more if the

plan had been his own. (*13)



On the 26th of May I sent Blair's division up the Yazoo to drive

out a force of the enemy supposed to be between the Big Black and

the Yazoo.  The country was rich and full of supplies of both

food and forage.  Blair was instructed to take all of it.  The

cattle were to be driven in for the use of our army, and the

food and forage to be consumed by our troops or destroyed by

fire; all bridges were to be destroyed, and the roads rendered

as nearly impassable as possible.  Blair went forty-five miles

and was gone almost a week.  His work was effectually done.  I

requested Porter at this time to send the marine brigade, a

floating nondescript force which had been assigned to his

command and which proved very useful, up to Haines' Bluff to

hold it until reinforcements could be sent.



On the 26th I also received a letter from Banks, asking me to

reinforce him with ten thousand men at Port Hudson.  Of course I

could not comply with his request, nor did I think he needed

them.  He was in no danger of an attack by the garrison in his

front, and there was no army organizing in his rear to raise the

siege.



On the 3d of June a brigade from Hurlbut's command arrived,

General Kimball commanding.  It was sent to Mechanicsburg, some

miles north-east of Haines' Bluff and about midway between the

Big Black and the Yazoo.  A brigade of Blair's division and

twelve hundred cavalry had already, on Blair's return from the

Yazoo, been sent to the same place with instructions to watch

the crossings of the Big Black River, to destroy the roads in

his (Blair's) front, and to gather or destroy all supplies.



On the 7th of June our little force of colored and white troops

across the Mississippi, at Milliken's Bend, were attacked by

about 3,000 men from Richard Taylor's trans-Mississippi

command.  With the aid of the gunboats they were speedily

repelled.  I sent Mower's brigade over with instructions to

drive the enemy beyond the Tensas Bayou; and we had no further

trouble in that quarter during the siege.  This was the first

important engagement of the war in which colored troops were

under fire.  These men were very raw, having all been enlisted

since the beginning of the siege, but they behaved well.



On the 8th of June a full division arrived from Hurlbut's

command, under General Sooy Smith.  It was sent immediately to

Haines' Bluff, and General C. C. Washburn was assigned to the

general command at that point.



On the 11th a strong division arrived from the Department of the

Missouri under General Herron, which was placed on our left. This

cut off the last possible chance of communication between

Pemberton and Johnston, as it enabled Lauman to close up on

McClernand's left while Herron intrenched from Lauman to the

water's edge.  At this point the water recedes a few hundred

yards from the high land.  Through this opening no doubt the

Confederate commanders had been able to get messengers under

cover of night.



On the 14th General Parke arrived with two divisions of

Burnside's corps, and was immediately dispatched to Haines'

Bluff.  These latter troops--Herron's and Parke's--were the

reinforcements already spoken of sent by Halleck in anticipation

of their being needed.  They arrived none too soon.



I now had about seventy-one thousand men.  More than half were

disposed across the peninsula, between the Yazoo at Haines'

Bluff and the Big Black, with the division of Osterhaus watching

the crossings of the latter river farther south and west from the

crossing of the Jackson road to Baldwin's ferry and below.



There were eight roads leading into Vicksburg, along which and

their immediate sides, our work was specially pushed and

batteries advanced; but no commanding point within range of the

enemy was neglected.



On the 17th I received a letter from General Sherman and one on

the 18th from General McPherson, saying that their respective

commands had complained to them of a fulsome, congratulatory

order published by General McClernand to the 13th corps, which

did great injustice to the other troops engaged in the

campaign.  This order had been sent North and published, and now

papers containing it had reached our camps.  The order had not

been heard of by me, and certainly not by troops outside of

McClernand's command until brought in this way.  I at once wrote

to McClernand, directing him to send me a copy of this order.  He

did so, and I at once relieved him from the command of the 13th

army corps and ordered him back to Springfield, Illinois.  The

publication of his order in the press was in violation of War

Department orders and also of mine.
