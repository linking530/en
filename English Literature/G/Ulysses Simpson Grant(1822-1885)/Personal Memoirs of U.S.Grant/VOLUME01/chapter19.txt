COMMISSIONED BRIGADIER-GENERAL--COMMAND AT IRONTON,

MO.--JEFFERSON CITY--CAPE GIRARDEAU--GENERAL PRENTISS --SEIZURE

OF PADUCAH--HEADQUARTERS AT CAIRO.



I had not been in Mexico many weeks when, reading a St. Louis

paper, I found the President had asked the Illinois delegation

in Congress to recommend some citizens of the State for the

position of brigadier-general, and that they had unanimously

recommended me as first on a list of seven.  I was very much

surprised because, as I have said, my acquaintance with the

Congressmen was very limited and I did not know of anything I

had done to inspire such confidence.  The papers of the next day

announced that my name, with three others, had been sent to the

Senate, and a few days after our confirmation was announced.



When appointed brigadier-general I at once thought it proper

that one of my aides should come from the regiment I had been

commanding, and so selected Lieutenant C. B. Lagow.  While

living in St. Louis, I had had a desk in the law office of

McClellan, Moody and Hillyer.  Difference in views between the

members of the firm on the questions of the day, and general

hard times in the border cities, had broken up this firm.

Hillyer was quite a young man, then in his twenties, and very

brilliant.  I asked him to accept a place on my staff.  I also

wanted to take one man from my new home, Galena.  The canvass in

the Presidential campaign the fall before had brought out a young

lawyer by the name of John A. Rawlins, who proved himself one of

the ablest speakers in the State.  He was also a candidate for

elector on the Douglas ticket.  When Sumter was fired upon and

the integrity of the Union threatened, there was no man more

ready to serve his country than he.  I wrote at once asking him

to accept the position of assistant adjutant-general with the

rank of captain, on my staff.  He was about entering the service

as major of a new regiment then organizing in the north-western

part of the State; but he threw this up and accepted my offer.



Neither Hillyer nor Lagow proved to have any particular taste or

special qualifications for the duties of the soldier, and the

former resigned during the Vicksburg campaign; the latter I

relieved after the battle of Chattanooga.  Rawlins remained with

me as long as he lived, and rose to the rank of brigadier general

and chief-of-staff to the General of the Army--an office created

for him--before the war closed.  He was an able man, possessed

of great firmness, and could say "no" so emphatically to a

request which he thought should not be granted that the person

he was addressing would understand at once that there was no use

of pressing the matter.  General Rawlins was a very useful

officer in other ways than this.  I became very much attached to

him.



Shortly after my promotion I was ordered to Ironton, Missouri,

to command a district in that part of the State, and took the

21st Illinois, my old regiment, with me.  Several other

regiments were ordered to the same destination about the same

time.  Ironton is on the Iron Mountain railroad, about seventy

miles south of St. Louis, and situated among hills rising almost

to the dignity of mountains.  When I reached there, about the 8th

of August, Colonel B. Gratz Brown--afterwards Governor of

Missouri and in 1872 Vice-Presidential candidate--was in

command.  Some of his troops were ninety days' men and their

time had expired some time before.  The men had no clothing but

what they had volunteered in, and much of this was so worn that

it would hardly stay on.  General Hardee--the author of the

tactics I did not study--was at Greenville some twenty-five

miles further south, it was said, with five thousand Confederate

troops.  Under these circumstances Colonel Brown's command was

very much demoralized.  A squadron of cavalry could have ridden

into the valley and captured the entire force.  Brown himself

was gladder to see me on that occasion than he ever has been

since.  I relieved him and sent all his men home within a day or

two, to be mustered out of service.



Within ten days after reading Ironton I was prepared to take the

offensive against the enemy at Greenville.  I sent a column east

out of the valley we were in, with orders to swing around to the

south and west and come into the Greenville road ten miles south

of Ironton.  Another column marched on the direct road and went

into camp at the point designated for the two columns to meet. I

was to ride out the next morning and take personal command of the

movement.  My experience against Harris, in northern Missouri,

had inspired me with confidence.  But when the evening train

came in, it brought General B. M. Prentiss with orders to take

command of the district.  His orders did not relieve me, but I

knew that by law I was senior, and at that time even the

President did not have the authority to assign a junior to

command a senior of the same grade.  I therefore gave General

Prentiss the situation of the troops and the general condition

of affairs, and started for St. Louis the same day.  The

movement against the rebels at Greenville went no further.



From St. Louis I was ordered to Jefferson City, the capital of

the State, to take command.  General Sterling Price, of the

Confederate army, was thought to be threatening the capital,

Lexington, Chillicothe and other comparatively large towns in

the central part of Missouri.  I found a good many troops in

Jefferson City, but in the greatest confusion, and no one person

knew where they all were.  Colonel Mulligan, a gallant man, was

in command, but he had not been educated as yet to his new

profession and did not know how to maintain discipline.  I found

that volunteers had obtained permission from the department

commander, or claimed they had, to raise, some of them,

regiments; some battalions; some companies--the officers to be

commissioned according to the number of men they brought into

the service.  There were recruiting stations all over town, with

notices, rudely lettered on boards over the doors, announcing the

arm of service and length of time for which recruits at that

station would be received.  The law required all volunteers to

serve for three years or the war.  But in Jefferson City in

August, 1861, they were recruited for different periods and on

different conditions; some were enlisted for six months, some

for a year, some without any condition as to where they were to

serve, others were not to be sent out of the State.  The

recruits were principally men from regiments stationed there and

already in the service, bound for three years if the war lasted

that long.



The city was filled with Union fugitives who had been driven by

guerilla bands to take refuge with the National troops.  They

were in a deplorable condition and must have starved but for the

support the government gave them.  They had generally made their

escape with a team or two, sometimes a yoke of oxen with a mule

or a horse in the lead.  A little bedding besides their clothing

and some food had been thrown into the wagon.  All else of their

worldly goods were abandoned and appropriated by their former

neighbors; for the Union man in Missouri who staid at home

during the rebellion, if he was not immediately under the

protection of the National troops, was at perpetual war with his

neighbors.  I stopped the recruiting service, and disposed the

troops about the outskirts of the city so as to guard all

approaches.  Order was soon restored.



I had been at Jefferson City but a few days when I was directed

from department headquarters to fit out an expedition to

Lexington, Booneville and Chillicothe, in order to take from the

banks in those cities all the funds they had and send them to St.

Louis.  The western army had not yet been supplied with

transportation.  It became necessary therefore to press into the

service teams belonging to sympathizers with the rebellion or to

hire those of Union men.  This afforded an opportunity of giving

employment to such of the refugees within our lines as had teams

suitable for our purposes.  They accepted the service with

alacrity.  As fast as troops could be got off they were moved

west some twenty miles or more.  In seven or eight days from my

assuming command at Jefferson City, I had all the troops, except

a small garrison, at an advanced position and expected to join

them myself the next day.



But my campaigns had not yet begun, for while seated at my

office door, with nothing further to do until it was time to

start for the front, I saw an officer of rank approaching, who

proved to be Colonel Jefferson C. Davis.  I had never met him

before, but he introduced himself by handing me an order for him

to proceed to Jefferson City and relieve me of the command.  The

orders directed that I should report at department headquarters

at St. Louis without delay, to receive important special

instructions.  It was about an hour before the only regular

train of the day would start.  I therefore turned over to

Colonel Davis my orders, and hurriedly stated to him the

progress that had been made to carry out the department

instructions already described.  I had at that time but one

staff officer, doing myself all the detail work usually

performed by an adjutant-general.  In an hour after being

relieved from the command I was on my way to St. Louis, leaving

my single staff officer(*6) to follow the next day with our

horses and baggage.



The "important special instructions" which I received the next

day, assigned me to the command of the district of south-east

Missouri, embracing all the territory south of St. Louis, in

Missouri, as well as all southern Illinois.  At first I was to

take personal command of a combined expedition that had been

ordered for the capture of Colonel Jeff. Thompson, a sort of

independent or partisan commander who was disputing with us the

possession of south-east Missouri.  Troops had been ordered to

move from Ironton to Cape Girardeau, sixty or seventy miles to

the south-east, on the Mississippi River; while the forces at

Cape Girardeau had been ordered to move to Jacksonville, ten

miles out towards Ironton; and troops at Cairo and Bird's Point,

at the junction of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, were to hold

themselves in readiness to go down the Mississippi to Belmont,

eighteen miles below, to be moved west from there when an

officer should come to command them.  I was the officer who had

been selected for this purpose.  Cairo was to become my

headquarters when the expedition terminated.



In pursuance of my orders I established my temporary

headquarters at Cape Girardeau and sent instructions to the

commanding officer at Jackson, to inform me of the approach of

General Prentiss from Ironton.  Hired wagons were kept moving

night and day to take additional rations to Jackson, to supply

the troops when they started from there.  Neither General

Prentiss nor Colonel Marsh, who commanded at Jackson, knew their

destination.  I drew up all the instructions for the contemplated

move, and kept them in my pocket until I should hear of the

junction of our troops at Jackson.  Two or three days after my

arrival at Cape Girardeau, word came that General Prentiss was

approaching that place (Jackson).  I started at once to meet him

there and to give him his orders.  As I turned the first corner

of a street after starting, I saw a column of cavalry passing

the next street in front of me.  I turned and rode around the

block the other way, so as to meet the head of the column.  I

found there General Prentiss himself, with a large escort.  He

had halted his troops at Jackson for the night, and had come on

himself to Cape Girardeau, leaving orders for his command to

follow him in the morning.  I gave the General his orders--which

stopped him at Jackson--but he was very much aggrieved at being

placed under another brigadier-general, particularly as he

believed himself to be the senior.  He had been a brigadier, in

command at Cairo, while I was mustering officer at Springfield

without any rank.  But we were nominated at the same time for

the United States service, and both our commissions bore date

May 17th, 1861.  By virtue of my former army rank I was, by law,

the senior.  General Prentiss failed to get orders to his troops

to remain at Jackson, and the next morning early they were

reported as approaching Cape Girardeau.  I then ordered the

General very peremptorily to countermarch his command and take

it back to Jackson.  He obeyed the order, but bade his command

adieu when he got them to Jackson, and went to St. Louis and

reported himself.  This broke up the expedition.  But little

harm was done, as Jeff. Thompson moved light and had no fixed

place for even nominal headquarters.  He was as much at home in

Arkansas as he was in Missouri and would keep out of the way of

a superior force.  Prentiss was sent to another part of the

State.



General Prentiss made a great mistake on the above occasion, one

that he would not have committed later in the war.  When I came

to know him better, I regretted it much.  In consequence of this

occurrence he was off duty in the field when the principal

campaign at the West was going on, and his juniors received

promotion while he was where none could be obtained.  He would

have been next to myself in rank in the district of south-east

Missouri, by virtue of his services in the Mexican war.  He was

a brave and very earnest soldier.  No man in the service was

more sincere in his devotion to the cause for which we were

battling; none more ready to make sacrifices or risk life in it.



On the 4th of September I removed my headquarters to Cairo and

found Colonel Richard Oglesby in command of the post.  We had

never met, at least not to my knowledge.  After my promotion I

had ordered my brigadier-general's uniform from New York, but it

had not yet arrived, so that I was in citizen's dress.  The

Colonel had his office full of people, mostly from the

neighboring States of Missouri and Kentucky, making complaints

or asking favors.  He evidently did not catch my name when I was

presented, for on my taking a piece of paper from the table where

he was seated and writing the order assuming command of the

district of south-east Missouri, Colonel Richard J. Oglesby to

command the post at Bird's Point, and handing it to him, he put

on an expression of surprise that looked a little as if he would

like to have some one identify me.  But he surrendered the office

without question.



The day after I assumed command at Cairo a man came to me who

said he was a scout of General Fremont.  He reported that he had

just come from Columbus, a point on the Mississippi twenty miles

below on the Kentucky side, and that troops had started from

there, or were about to start, to seize Paducah, at the mouth of

the Tennessee.  There was no time for delay; I reported by

telegraph to the department commander the information I had

received, and added that I was taking steps to get off that

night to be in advance of the enemy in securing that important

point.  There was a large number of steamers Iying at Cairo and

a good many boatmen were staying in the town.  It was the work

of only a few hours to get the boats manned, with coal aboard

and steam up.  Troops were also designated to go aboard.  The

distance from Cairo to Paducah is about forty-five miles.  I did

not wish to get there before daylight of the 6th, and directed

therefore that the boats should lie at anchor out in the stream

until the time to start.  Not having received an answer to my

first dispatch, I again telegraphed to department headquarters

that I should start for Paducah that night unless I received

further orders.  Hearing nothing, we started before midnight and

arrived early the following morning, anticipating the enemy by

probably not over six or eight hours.  It proved very fortunate

that the expedition against Jeff. Thompson had been broken up. 

Had it not been, the enemy would have seized Paducah and

fortified it, to our very great annoyance.



When the National troops entered the town the citizens were

taken by surprise.  I never after saw such consternation

depicted on the faces of the people.  Men, women and children

came out of their doors looking pale and frightened at the

presence of the invader.  They were expecting rebel troops that

day.  In fact, nearly four thousand men from Columbus were at

that time within ten or fifteen miles of Paducah on their way to

occupy the place.  I had but two regiments and one battery with

me, but the enemy did not know this and returned to Columbus.  I

stationed my troops at the best points to guard the roads leading

into the city, left gunboats to guard the river fronts and by

noon was ready to start on my return to Cairo.  Before leaving,

however, I addressed a short printed proclamation to the

citizens of Paducah assuring them of our peaceful intentions,

that we had come among them to protect them against the enemies

of our country, and that all who chose could continue their

usual avocations with assurance of the protection of the

government.  This was evidently a relief to them; but the

majority would have much preferred the presence of the other

army.  I reinforced Paducah rapidly from the troops at Cape

Girardeau; and a day or two later General C. F. Smith, a most

accomplished soldier, reported at Cairo and was assigned to the

command of the post at the mouth of the Tennessee.  In a short

time it was well fortified and a detachment was sent to occupy

Smithland, at the mouth of the Cumberland.



The State government of Kentucky at that time was rebel in

sentiment, but wanted to preserve an armed neutrality between

the North and the South, and the governor really seemed to think

the State had a perfect right to maintain a neutral position. The

rebels already occupied two towns in the State, Columbus and

Hickman, on the Mississippi; and at the very moment the National

troops were entering Paducah from the Ohio front, General Lloyd

Tilghman--a Confederate--with his staff and a small detachment

of men, were getting out in the other direction, while, as I

have already said, nearly four thousand Confederate troops were

on Kentucky soil on their way to take possession of the town.

But, in the estimation of the governor and of those who thought

with him, this did not justify the National authorities in

invading the soil of Kentucky.  I informed the legislature of

the State of what I was doing, and my action was approved by the

majority of that body.  On my return to Cairo I found authority

from department headquarters for me to take Paducah "if I felt

strong enough," but very soon after I was reprimanded from the

same quarters for my correspondence with the legislature and

warned against a repetition of the offence.



Soon after I took command at Cairo, General Fremont entered into

arrangements for the exchange of the prisoners captured at Camp

Jackson in the month of May.  I received orders to pass them

through my lines to Columbus as they presented themselves with

proper credentials.  Quite a number of these prisoners I had

been personally acquainted with before the war.  Such of them as

I had so known were received at my headquarters as old

acquaintances, and ordinary routine business was not disturbed

by their presence.  On one occasion when several were present in

my office my intention to visit Cape Girardeau the next day, to

inspect the troops at that point, was mentioned.  Something

transpired which postponed my trip; but a steamer employed by

the government was passing a point some twenty or more miles

above Cairo, the next day, when a section of rebel artillery

with proper escort brought her to.  A major, one of those who

had been at my headquarters the day before, came at once aboard

and after some search made a direct demand for my delivery.  It

was hard to persuade him that I was not there.  This officer was

Major Barrett, of St. Louis.  I had been acquainted with his

family before the war.
