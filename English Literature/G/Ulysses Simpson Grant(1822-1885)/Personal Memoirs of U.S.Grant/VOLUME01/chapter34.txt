CAPTURE OF PORT GIBSON--GRIERSON'S RAID--OCCUPATION OF GRAND

GULF--MOVEMENT UP THE BIG BLACK--BATTLE OF RAYMOND.



We started next morning for Port Gibson as soon as it was light

enough to see the road.  We were soon in the town, and I was

delighted to find that the enemy had not stopped to contest our

crossing further at the bridge, which he had burned.  The troops

were set to work at once to construct a bridge across the South

Fork of the Bayou Pierre.  At this time the water was high and

the current rapid.  What might be called a raft-bridge was soon

constructed from material obtained from wooden buildings,

stables, fences, etc., which sufficed for carrying the whole

army over safely.  Colonel J. H. Wilson, a member of my staff,

planned and superintended the construction of this bridge, going

into the water and working as hard as any one engaged.  Officers

and men generally joined in this work.  When it was finished the

army crossed and marched eight miles beyond to the North Fork

that day.  One brigade of Logan's division was sent down the

stream to occupy the attention of a rebel battery, which had

been left behind with infantry supports to prevent our repairing

the burnt railroad bridge.  Two of his brigades were sent up the

bayou to find a crossing and reach the North Fork to repair the

bridge there.  The enemy soon left when he found we were

building a bridge elsewhere.  Before leaving Port Gibson we were

reinforced by Crocker's division, McPherson's corps, which had

crossed the Mississippi at Bruinsburg and come up without

stopping except to get two days' rations.  McPherson still had

one division west of the Mississippi River, guarding the road

from Milliken's Bend to the river below until Sherman's command

should relieve it.



On leaving Bruinsburg for the front I left my son Frederick, who

had joined me a few weeks before, on board one of the gunboats

asleep, and hoped to get away without him until after Grand Gulf

should fall into our hands; but on waking up he learned that I

had gone, and being guided by the sound of the battle raging at

Thompson's Hill--called the Battle of Port Gibson--found his way

to where I was.  He had no horse to ride at the time, and I had

no facilities for even preparing a meal.  He, therefore, foraged

around the best he could until we reached Grand Gulf.  Mr. C. A.

Dana, then an officer of the War Department, accompanied me on

the Vicksburg campaign and through a portion of the siege.  He

was in the same situation as Fred so far as transportation and

mess arrangements were concerned.  The first time I call to mind

seeing either of them, after the battle, they were mounted on two

enormous horses, grown white from age, each equipped with

dilapidated saddles and bridles.



Our trains arrived a few days later, after which we were all

perfectly equipped.



My son accompanied me throughout the campaign and siege, and

caused no anxiety either to me or to his mother, who was at

home.  He looked out for himself and was in every battle of the

campaign.  His age, then not quite thirteen, enabled him to take

in all he saw, and to retain a recollection of it that would not

be possible in more mature years.



When the movement from Bruinsburg commenced we were without a

wagon train.  The train still west of the Mississippi was

carried around with proper escort, by a circuitous route from

Milliken's Bend to Hard Times seventy or more miles below, and

did not get up for some days after the battle of Port Gibson. My

own horses, headquarters' transportation, servants, mess chest,

and everything except what I had on, was with this train. 

General A. J. Smith happened to have an extra horse at

Bruinsburg which I borrowed, with a saddle-tree without

upholstering further than stirrups.  I had no other for nearly a

week.



It was necessary to have transportation for ammunition.

Provisions could be taken from the country; but all the

ammunition that can be carried on the person is soon exhausted

when there is much fighting.  I directed, therefore, immediately

on landing that all the vehicles and draft animals, whether

horses, mules, or oxen, in the vicinity should be collected and

loaded to their capacity with ammunition.  Quite a train was

collected during the 30th, and a motley train it was.  In it

could be found fine carriages, loaded nearly to the top with

boxes of cartridges that had been pitched in promiscuously,

drawn by mules with plough, harness, straw collars, rope-lines,

etc.; long-coupled wagons, with racks for carrying cotton bales,

drawn by oxen, and everything that could be found in the way of

transportation on a plantation, either for use or pleasure.  The

making out of provision returns was stopped for the time.  No

formalities were to retard our progress until a position was

secured when the time could be spared to observe them.



It was at Port Gibson I first heard through a Southern paper of

the complete success of Colonel Grierson, who was making a raid

through central Mississippi.  He had started from La Grange

April 17th with three regiments of about 1,700 men.  On the 21st

he had detached Colonel Hatch with one regiment to destroy the

railroad between Columbus and Macon and then return to La

Grange.  Hatch had a sharp fight with the enemy at Columbus and

retreated along the railroad, destroying it at Okalona and

Tupelo, and arriving in La Grange April 26.  Grierson continued

his movement with about 1,000 men, breaking the Vicksburg and

Meridian railroad and the New Orleans and Jackson railroad,

arriving at Baton Rouge May 2d.  This raid was of great

importance, for Grierson had attracted the attention of the

enemy from the main movement against Vicksburg.



During the night of the 2d of May the bridge over the North Fork

was repaired, and the troops commenced crossing at five the next

morning.  Before the leading brigade was over it was fired upon

by the enemy from a commanding position; but they were soon

driven off.  It was evident that the enemy was covering a

retreat from Grand Gulf to Vicksburg.  Every commanding position

from this (Grindstone) crossing to Hankinson's ferry over the Big

Black was occupied by the retreating foe to delay our progress.

McPherson, however, reached Hankinson's ferry before night,

seized the ferry boat, and sent a detachment of his command

across and several miles north on the road to Vicksburg.  When

the junction of the road going to Vicksburg with the road from

Grand Gulf to Raymond and Jackson was reached, Logan with his

division was turned to the left towards Grand Gulf.  I went with

him a short distance from this junction.  McPherson had

encountered the largest force yet met since the battle of Port

Gibson and had a skirmish nearly approaching a battle; but the

road Logan had taken enabled him to come up on the enemy's right

flank, and they soon gave way.  McPherson was ordered to hold

Hankinson's ferry and the road back to Willow Springs with one

division; McClernand, who was now in the rear, was to join in

this as well as to guard the line back down the bayou.  I did

not want to take the chances of having an enemy lurking in our

rear.



On the way from the junction to Grand Gulf, where the road comes

into the one from Vicksburg to the same place six or seven miles

out, I learned that the last of the enemy had retreated past

that place on their way to Vicksburg.  I left Logan to make the

proper disposition of his troops for the night, while I rode

into the town with an escort of about twenty cavalry.  Admiral

Porter had already arrived with his fleet.  The enemy had

abandoned his heavy guns and evacuated the place.



When I reached Grand Gulf May 3d I had not been with my baggage

since the 27th of April and consequently had had no change of

underclothing, no meal except such as I could pick up sometimes

at other headquarters, and no tent to cover me.  The first thing

I did was to get a bath, borrow some fresh underclothing from one

of the naval officers and get a good meal on the flag-ship.  Then

I wrote letters to the general-in-chief informing him of our

present position, dispatches to be telegraphed from Cairo,

orders to General Sullivan commanding above Vicksburg, and gave

orders to all my corps commanders.  About twelve o'clock at

night I was through my work and started for Hankinson's ferry,

arriving there before daylight.  While at Grand Gulf I heard

from Banks, who was on the Red River, and who said that he could

not be at Port Hudson before the 10th of May and then with only

15,000 men.  Up to this time my intention had been to secure

Grand Gulf, as a base of supplies, detach McClernand's corps to

Banks and co-operate with him in the reduction of Port Hudson.



The news from Banks forced upon me a different plan of campaign

from the one intended.  To wait for his co-operation would have

detained me at least a month.  The reinforcements would not have

reached ten thousand men after deducting casualties and necessary

river guards at all high points close to the river for over three

hundred miles.  The enemy would have strengthened his position

and been reinforced by more men than Banks could have brought. I

therefore determined to move independently of Banks, cut loose

from my base, destroy the rebel force in rear of Vicksburg and

invest or capture the city.



Grand Gulf was accordingly given up as a base and the

authorities at Washington were notified.  I knew well that

Halleck's caution would lead him to disapprove of this course;

but it was the only one that gave any chance of success.  The

time it would take to communicate with Washington and get a

reply would be so great that I could not be interfered with

until it was demonstrated whether my plan was practicable.  Even

Sherman, who afterwards ignored bases of supplies other than what

were afforded by the country while marching through four States

of the Confederacy with an army more than twice as large as mine

at this time, wrote me from Hankinson's ferry, advising me of the

impossibility of supplying our army over a single road.  He urged

me to "stop all troops till your army is partially supplied with

wagons, and then act as quick as possible; for this road will be

jammed, as sure as life."  To this I replied:  "I do not

calculate upon the possibility of supplying the army with full

rations from Grand Gulf.  I know it will be impossible without

constructing additional roads.  What I do expect is to get up

what rations of hard bread, coffee and salt we can, and make the

country furnish the balance."  We started from Bruinsburg with an

average of about two days' rations, and received no more from our

own supplies for some days; abundance was found in the mean

time.  A delay would give the enemy time to reinforce and

fortify.



McClernand's and McPherson's commands were kept substantially as

they were on the night of the 2d, awaiting supplies sufficient to

give them three days' rations in haversacks.  Beef, mutton,

poultry and forage were found in abundance.  Quite a quantity of

bacon and molasses was also secured from the country, but bread

and coffee could not be obtained in quantity sufficient for all

the men.  Every plantation, however, had a run of stone,

propelled by mule power, to grind corn for the owners and their

slaves.  All these were kept running while we were stopping, day

and night, and when we were marching, during the night, at all

plantations covered by the troops.  But the product was taken by

the troops nearest by, so that the majority of the command was

destined to go without bread until a new base was established on

the Yazoo above Vicksburg.



While the troops were awaiting the arrival of rations I ordered

reconnoissances made by McClernand and McPherson, with the view

of leading the enemy to believe that we intended to cross the

Big Black and attack the city at once.



On the 6th Sherman arrived at Grand Gulf and crossed his command

that night and the next day.  Three days' rations had been

brought up from Grand Gulf for the advanced troops and were

issued.  Orders were given for a forward movement the next

day.  Sherman was directed to order up Blair, who had been left

behind to guard the road from Milliken's Bend to Hard Times with

two brigades.



The quartermaster at Young's Point was ordered to send two

hundred wagons with Blair, and the commissary was to load them

with hard bread, coffee, sugar, salt and one hundred thousand

pounds of salt meat.



On the 3d Hurlbut, who had been left at Memphis, was ordered to

send four regiments from his command to Milliken's Bend to

relieve Blair's division, and on the 5th he was ordered to send

Lauman's division in addition, the latter to join the army in

the field.  The four regiments were to be taken from troops near

the river so that there would be no delay.



During the night of the 6th McPherson drew in his troops north

of the Big Black and was off at an early hour on the road to

Jackson, via Rocky Springs, Utica and Raymond.  That night he

and McClernand were both at Rocky Springs ten miles from

Hankinson's ferry.  McPherson remained there during the 8th,

while McClernand moved to Big Sandy and Sherman marched from

Grand Gulf to Hankinson's ferry.  The 9th, McPherson moved to a

point within a few miles west of Utica; McClernand and Sherman

remained where they were.  On the 10th McPherson moved to Utica,

Sherman to Big Sandy; McClernand was still at Big Sandy.  The

11th, McClernand was at Five Mile Creek; Sherman at Auburn;

McPherson five miles advanced from Utica. May 12th, McClernand

was at Fourteen Mile Creek; Sherman at Fourteen Mile Creek;

McPherson at Raymond after a battle.



After McPherson crossed the Big Black at Hankinson's ferry

Vicksburg could have been approached and besieged by the south

side.  It is not probable, however, that Pemberton would have

permitted a close besiegement.  The broken nature of the ground

would have enabled him to hold a strong defensible line from the

river south of the city to the Big Black, retaining possession of

the railroad back to that point.  It was my plan, therefore, to

get to the railroad east of Vicksburg, and approach from that

direction.  Accordingly, McPherson's troops that had crossed the

Big Black were withdrawn and the movement east to Jackson

commenced.



As has been stated before, the country is very much broken and

the roads generally confined to the tops of the hills.  The

troops were moved one (sometimes two) corps at a time to reach

designated points out parallel to the railroad and only from six

to ten miles from it.  McClernand's corps was kept with its left

flank on the Big Black guarding all the crossings.  Fourteen

Mile Creek, a stream substantially parallel with the railroad,

was reached and crossings effected by McClernand and Sherman

with slight loss.  McPherson was to the right of Sherman,

extending to Raymond.  The cavalry was used in this advance in

reconnoitring to find the roads:  to cover our advances and to

find the most practicable routes from one command to another so

they could support each other in case of an attack.  In making

this move I estimated Pemberton's movable force at Vicksburg at

about eighteen thousand men, with smaller forces at Haines'

Bluff and Jackson.  It would not be possible for Pemberton to

attack me with all his troops at one place, and I determined to

throw my army between his and fight him in detail.  This was

done with success, but I found afterwards that I had entirely

under-estimated Pemberton's strength.



Up to this point our movements had been made without serious

opposition.  My line was now nearly parallel with the Jackson

and Vicksburg railroad and about seven miles south of it.  The

right was at Raymond eighteen miles from Jackson, McPherson

commanding; Sherman in the centre on Fourteen Mile Creek, his

advance thrown across; McClernand to the left, also on Fourteen

Mile Creek, advance across, and his pickets within two miles of

Edward's station, where the enemy had concentrated a

considerable force and where they undoubtedly expected us to

attack.  McClernand's left was on the Big Black.  In all our

moves, up to this time, the left had hugged the Big Black

closely, and all the ferries had been guarded to prevent the

enemy throwing a force on our rear.



McPherson encountered the enemy, five thousand strong with two

batteries under General Gregg, about two miles out of Raymond.

This was about two P.M.  Logan was in advance with one of his

brigades.  He deployed and moved up to engage the enemy.

McPherson ordered the road in rear to be cleared of wagons, and

the balance of Logan's division, and Crocker's, which was still

farther in rear, to come forward with all dispatch.  The order

was obeyed with alacrity.  Logan got his division in position

for assault before Crocker could get up, and attacked with

vigor, carrying the enemy's position easily, sending Gregg

flying from the field not to appear against our front again

until we met at Jackson.



In this battle McPherson lost 66 killed, 339 wounded, and 37

missing--nearly or quite all from Logan's division.  The enemy's

loss was 100 killed, 305 wounded, besides 415 taken prisoners.



I regarded Logan and Crocker as being as competent division

commanders as could be found in or out of the army and both

equal to a much higher command.  Crocker, however, was dying of

consumption when he volunteered.  His weak condition never put

him on the sick report when there was a battle in prospect, as

long as he could keep on his feet.  He died not long after the

close of the rebellion.
