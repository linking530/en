INVESTMENT OF FORT DONELSON--THE NAVAL OPERATIONS--ATTACK OF THE

ENEMY--ASSAULTING THE WORKS--SURRENDER OF THE FORT.



I informed the department commander of our success at Fort Henry

and that on the 8th I would take Fort Donelson.  But the rain

continued to fall so heavily that the roads became impassable

for artillery and wagon trains.  Then, too, it would not have

been prudent to proceed without the gunboats.  At least it would

have been leaving behind a valuable part of our available force.



On the 7th, the day after the fall of Fort Henry, I took my

staff and the cavalry--a part of one regiment--and made a

reconnoissance to within about a mile of the outer line of works

at Donelson.  I had known General Pillow in Mexico, and judged

that with any force, no matter how small, I could march up to

within gunshot of any intrenchments he was given to hold.  I

said this to the officers of my staff at the time.  I knew that

Floyd was in command, but he was no soldier, and I judged that

he would yield to Pillow's pretensions.  I met, as I expected,

no opposition in making the reconnoissance and, besides learning

the topography of the country on the way and around Fort

Donelson, found that there were two roads available for

marching; one leading to the village of Dover, the other to

Donelson.



Fort Donelson is two miles north, or down the river, from

Dover.  The fort, as it stood in 1861, embraced about one

hundred acres of land.  On the east it fronted the Cumberland;

to the north it faced Hickman's creek, a small stream which at

that time was deep and wide because of the back-water from the

river; on the south was another small stream, or rather a

ravine, opening into the Cumberland.  This also was filled with

back-water from the river.  The fort stood on high ground, some

of it as much as a hundred feet above the Cumberland.  Strong

protection to the heavy guns in the water batteries had been

obtained by cutting away places for them in the bluff.  To the

west there was a line of rifle pits some two miles back from the

river at the farthest point.  This line ran generally along the

crest of high ground, but in one place crossed a ravine which

opens into the river between the village and the fort.  The

ground inside and outside of this intrenched line was very

broken and generally wooded.  The trees outside of the

rifle-pits had been cut down for a considerable way out, and had

been felled so that their tops lay outwards from the

intrenchments.  The limbs had been trimmed and pointed, and thus

formed an abatis in front of the greater part of the line.

Outside of this intrenched line, and extending about half the

entire length of it, is a ravine running north and south and

opening into Hickman creek at a point north of the fort.  The

entire side of this ravine next to the works was one long abatis.



General Halleck commenced his efforts in all quarters to get

reinforcements to forward to me immediately on my departure from

Cairo.  General Hunter sent men freely from Kansas, and a large

division under General Nelson, from Buell's army, was also

dispatched.  Orders went out from the War Department to

consolidate fragments of companies that were being recruited in

the Western States so as to make full companies, and to

consolidate companies into regiments.  General Halleck did not

approve or disapprove of my going to Fort Donelson.  He said

nothing whatever to me on the subject.  He informed Buell on the

7th that I would march against Fort Donelson the next day; but on

the 10th he directed me to fortify Fort Henry strongly,

particularly to the land side, saying that he forwarded me

intrenching tools for that purpose.  I received this dispatch in

front of Fort Donelson.



I was very impatient to get to Fort Donelson because I knew the

importance of the place to the enemy and supposed he would

reinforce it rapidly.  I felt that 15,000 men on the 8th would

be more effective than 50,000 a month later.  I asked

Flag-officer Foote, therefore, to order his gunboats still about

Cairo to proceed up the Cumberland River and not to wait for

those gone to Eastport and  Florence; but the others got back in

time and we started on the 12th.  I had moved McClernand out a

few miles the night before so as to leave the road as free as

possible.



Just as we were about to start the first reinforcement reached

me on transports.  It was a brigade composed of six full

regiments commanded by Colonel Thayer, of Nebraska.  As the

gunboats were going around to Donelson by the Tennessee, Ohio

and Cumberland rivers, I directed Thayer to turn about and go

under their convoy.



I started from Fort Henry with 15,000 men, including eight

batteries and part of a regiment of cavalry, and, meeting with

no obstruction to detain us, the advance arrived in front of the

enemy by noon.  That afternoon and the next day were spent in

taking up ground to make the investment as complete as

possible.  General Smith had been directed to leave a portion of

his division behind to guard forts Henry and Heiman.  He left

General Lew. Wallace with 2,500 men.  With the remainder of his

division he occupied our left, extending to Hickman creek.

McClernand was on the right and covered the roads running south

and south-west from Dover.  His right extended to the back-water

up the ravine opening into the Cumberland south of the village.

The troops were not intrenched, but the nature of the ground was

such that they were just as well protected from the fire of the

enemy as if rifle-pits had been thrown up.  Our line was

generally along the crest of ridges.  The artillery was

protected by being sunk in the ground.  The men who were not

serving the guns were perfectly covered from fire on taking

position a little back from the crest.  The greatest suffering

was from want of shelter.  It was midwinter and during the siege

we had rain and snow, thawing and freezing alternately.  It would

not do to allow camp-fires except far down the hill out of sight

of the enemy, and it would not do to allow many of the troops to

remain there at the same time.  In the march over from Fort Henry

numbers of the men had thrown away their blankets and

overcoats.  There was therefore much discomfort and absolute

suffering.



During the 12th and 13th, and until the arrival of Wallace and

Thayer on the 14th, the National forces, composed of but 15,000

men, without intrenchments, confronted an intrenched army of

21,000, without conflict further than what was brought on by

ourselves.  Only one gunboat had arrived.  There was a little

skirmishing each day, brought on by the movement of our troops

in securing commanding positions; but there was no actual

fighting during this time except once, on the 13th, in front of

McClernand's command.  That general had undertaken to capture a

battery of the enemy which was annoying his men.  Without orders

or authority he sent three regiments to make the assault.  The

battery was in the main line of the enemy, which was defended by

his whole army present.  Of course the assault was a failure, and

of course the loss on our side was great for the number of men

engaged.  In this assault Colonel William Morrison fell badly

wounded.  Up to this time the surgeons with the army had no

difficulty in finding room in the houses near our line for all

the sick and wounded; but now hospitals were overcrowded. Owing,

however, to the energy and skill of the surgeons the suffering

was not so great as it might have been.  The hospital

arrangements at Fort Donelson were as complete as it was

possible to make them, considering the inclemency of the weather

and the lack of tents, in a sparsely settled country where the

houses were generally of but one or two rooms.



On the return of Captain Walke to Fort Henry on the 10th, I had

requested him to take the vessels that had accompanied him on

his expedition up the Tennessee, and get possession of the

Cumberland as far up towards Donelson as possible.  He started

without delay, taking, however, only his own gunboat, the

Carondelet, towed by the steamer Alps.  Captain Walke arrived a

few miles below Donelson on the 12th, a little after noon. About

the time the advance of troops reached a point within gunshot of

the fort on the land side, he engaged the water batteries at

long range.  On the 13th I informed him of my arrival the day

before and of the establishment of most of our batteries,

requesting him at the same time to attack again that day so that

I might take advantage of any diversion.  The attack was made and

many shots fell within the fort, creating some consternation, as

we now know.  The investment on the land side was made as

complete as the number of troops engaged would admit of.



During the night of the 13th Flag-officer Foote arrived with the

iron-clads St. Louis, Louisville and Pittsburg and the wooden

gunboats Tyler and Conestoga, convoying Thayer's brigade.  On

the morning of the 14th Thayer was landed.  Wallace, whom I had

ordered over from Fort Henry, also arrived about the same

time.  Up to this time he had been commanding a brigade

belonging to the division of General C. F. Smith.  These troops

were now restored to the division they belonged to, and General

Lew. Wallace was assigned to the command of a division composed

of the brigade of Colonel Thayer and other reinforcements that

arrived the same day.  This new division was assigned to the

centre, giving the two flanking divisions an opportunity to

close up and form a stronger line.



The plan was for the troops to hold the enemy within his lines,

while the gunboats should attack the water batteries at close

quarters and silence his guns if possible.  Some of the gunboats

were to run the batteries, get above the fort and above the

village of Dover.  I had ordered a reconnoissance made with the

view of getting troops to the river above Dover in case they

should be needed there.  That position attained by the gunboats

it would have been but a question of time--and a very short

time, too--when the garrison would have been compelled to

surrender.



By three in the afternoon of the 14th Flag-officer Foote was

ready, and advanced upon the water batteries with his entire

fleet.  After coming in range of the batteries of the enemy the

advance was slow, but a constant fire was delivered from every

gun that could be brought to bear upon the fort.  I occupied a

position on shore from which I could see the advancing navy. The

leading boat got within a very short distance of the water

battery, not further off I think than two hundred yards, and I

soon saw one and then another of them dropping down the river,

visibly disabled.  Then the whole fleet followed and the

engagement closed for the day.  The gunboat which Flag-officer

Foote was on, besides having been hit about sixty times, several

of the shots passing through near the waterline, had a shot enter

the pilot-house which killed the pilot, carried away the wheel

and wounded the flag-officer himself.  The tiller-ropes of

another vessel were carried away and she, too, dropped

helplessly back.  Two others had their pilot-houses so injured

that they scarcely formed a protection to the men at the wheel.



The enemy had evidently been much demoralized by the assault,

but they were jubilant when they saw the disabled vessels

dropping down the river entirely out of the control of the men

on board.  Of course I only witnessed the falling back of our

gunboats and felt sad enough at the time over the repulse.

Subsequent reports, now published, show that the enemy

telegraphed a great victory to Richmond.  The sun went down on

the night of the 14th of February, 1862, leaving the army

confronting Fort Donelson anything but comforted over the

prospects.  The weather had turned intensely cold; the men were

without tents and could not keep up fires where most of them had

to stay, and, as previously stated, many had thrown away their

overcoats and blankets.  Two of the strongest of our gunboats

had been disabled, presumably beyond the possibility of

rendering any present assistance.  I retired this night not

knowing but that I would have to intrench my position, and bring

up tents for the men or build huts under the cover of the hills.



On the morning of the 15th, before it was yet broad day, a

messenger from Flag-officer Foote handed me a note, expressing a

desire to see me on the flag-ship and saying that he had been

injured the day before so much that he could not come himself to

me.  I at once made my preparations for starting.  I directed my

adjutant-general to notify each of the division commanders of my

absence and instruct them to do nothing to bring on an engagement

until they received further orders, but to hold their

positions.  From the heavy rains that had fallen for days and

weeks preceding and from the constant use of the roads between

the troops and the landing four to seven miles below, these

roads had become cut up so as to be hardly passable.  The

intense cold of the night of the 14th-15th had frozen the ground

solid.  This made travel on horseback even slower than through

the mud; but I went as fast as the roads would allow.



When I reached the fleet I found the flag-ship was anchored out

in the stream.  A small boat, however, awaited my arrival and I

was soon on board with the flag-officer.  He explained to me in

short the condition in which he was left by the engagement of

the evening before, and suggested that I should intrench while

he returned to Mound City with his disabled boats, expressing at

the time the belief that he could have the necessary repairs made

and be back in ten days.  I saw the absolute necessity of his

gunboats going into hospital and did not know but I should be

forced to the alternative of going through a siege.  But the

enemy relieved me from this necessity.



When I left the National line to visit Flag-officer Foote I had

no idea that there would be any engagement on land unless I

brought it on myself.  The conditions for battle were much more

favorable to us than they had been for the first two days of the

investment.  From the 12th to the 14th we had but 15,000 men of

all arms and no gunboats.  Now we had been reinforced by a fleet

of six naval vessels, a large division of troops under General L.

Wallace and 2,500 men brought over from Fort Henry belonging to

the division of C. F. Smith.  The enemy, however, had taken the

initiative.  Just as I landed I met Captain Hillyer of my staff,

white with fear, not for his personal safety, but for the safety

of the National troops.  He said the enemy had come out of his

lines in full force and attacked and scattered McClernand's

division, which was in full retreat.  The roads, as I have said,

were unfit for making fast time, but I got to my command as soon

as possible.  The attack had been made on the National right.  I

was some four or five miles north of our left.  The line was

about three miles long.  In reaching the point where the

disaster had occurred I had to pass the divisions of Smith and

Wallace.  I saw no sign of excitement on the portion of the line

held by Smith; Wallace was nearer the scene of conflict and had

taken part in it.  He had, at an opportune time, sent Thayer's

brigade to the support of McClernand and thereby contributed to

hold the enemy within his lines.



I saw everything favorable for us along the line of our left and

centre.  When I came to the right appearances were different. The

enemy had come out in full force to cut his way out and make his

escape.  McClernand's division had to bear the brunt of the

attack from this combined force.  His men had stood up gallantly

until the ammunition in their cartridge-boxes gave out.  There

was abundance of ammunition near by lying on the ground in

boxes, but at that stage of the war it was not all of our

commanders of regiments, brigades, or even divisions, who had

been educated up to the point of seeing that their men were

constantly supplied with ammunition during an engagement.  When

the men found themselves without ammunition they could not stand

up against troops who seemed to have plenty of it.  The division

broke and a portion fled, but most of the men, as they were not

pursued, only fell back out of range of the fire of the enemy.

It must have been about this time that Thayer pushed his brigade

in between the enemy and those of our troops that were without

ammunition.  At all events the enemy fell back within his

intrenchments and was there when I got on the field.



I saw the men standing in knots talking in the most excited

manner.  No officer seemed to be giving any directions.  The

soldiers had their muskets, but no ammunition, while there were

tons of it close at hand.  I heard some of the men say that the

enemy had come out with knapsacks, and haversacks filled with

rations.  They seemed to think this indicated a determination on

his part to stay out and fight just as long as the provisions

held out.  I turned to Colonel J. D. Webster, of my staff, who

was with me, and said:  "Some of our men are pretty badly

demoralized, but the enemy must be more so, for he has attempted

to force his way out, but has fallen back:  the one who attacks

first now will be victorious and the enemy will have to be in a

hurry if he gets ahead of me."  I determined to make the assault

at once on our left.  It was clear to my mind that the enemy had

started to march out with his entire force, except a few

pickets, and if our attack could be made on the left before the

enemy could redistribute his forces along the line, we would

find but little opposition except from the intervening abatis. 

I directed Colonel Webster to ride with me and call out to the

men as we passed:  "Fill your cartridge-boxes, quick, and get

into line; the enemy is trying to escape and he must not be

permitted to do so."  This acted like a charm.  The men only

wanted some one to give them a command.  We rode rapidly to

Smith's quarters, when I explained the situation to him and

directed him to charge the enemy's works in his front with his

whole division, saying at the same time that he would find

nothing but a very thin line to contend with.  The general was

off in an incredibly short time, going in advance himself to

keep his men from firing while they were working their way

through the abatis intervening between them and the enemy.  The

outer line of rifle-pits was passed, and the night of the 15th

General Smith, with much of his division, bivouacked within the

lines of the enemy.  There was now no doubt but that the

Confederates must surrender or be captured the next day.



There seems from subsequent accounts to have been much

consternation, particularly among the officers of high rank, in

Dover during the night of the 15th.  General Floyd, the

commanding officer, who was a man of talent enough for any civil

position, was no soldier and, possibly, did not possess the

elements of one.  He was further unfitted for command, for the

reason that his conscience must have troubled him and made him

afraid.  As Secretary of War he had taken a solemn oath to

maintain the Constitution of the United States and to uphold the

same against all its enemies.  He had betrayed that trust.  As

Secretary of War he was reported through the northern press to

have scattered the little army the country had so that the most

of it could be picked up in detail when secession occurred.

About a year before leaving the Cabinet he had removed arms from

northern to southern arsenals.  He continued in the Cabinet of

President Buchanan until about the 1st of January, 1861, while

he was working vigilantly for the establishment of a confederacy

made out of United States territory.  Well may he have been

afraid to fall into the hands of National troops.  He would no

doubt have been tried for misappropriating public property, if

not for treason, had he been captured.  General Pillow, next in

command, was conceited, and prided himself much on his services

in the Mexican war.  He telegraphed to General Johnston, at

Nashville, after our men were within the rebel rifle-pits, and

almost on the eve of his making his escape, that the Southern

troops had had great success all day.  Johnston forwarded the

dispatch to Richmond.  While the authorities at the capital were

reading it Floyd and Pillow were fugitives.



A council of war was held by the enemy at which all agreed that

it would be impossible to hold out longer.  General Buckner, who

was third in rank in the garrison but much the most capable

soldier, seems to have regarded it a duty to hold the fort until

the general commanding the department, A. S. Johnston, should get

back to his headquarters at Nashville.  Buckner's report shows,

however, that he considered Donelson lost and that any attempt

to hold the place longer would be at the sacrifice of the

command.  Being assured that Johnston was already in Nashville,

Buckner too agreed that surrender was the proper thing.  Floyd

turned over the command to Pillow, who declined it.  It then

devolved upon Buckner, who accepted the responsibility of the

position.  Floyd and Pillow took possession of all the river

transports at Dover and before morning both were on their way to

Nashville, with the brigade formerly commanded by Floyd and some

other troops, in all about 3,000.  Some marched up the east bank

of the Cumberland; others went on the steamers.  During the night

Forrest also, with his cavalry and some other troops about a

thousand in all, made their way out, passing between our right

and the river.  They had to ford or swim over the back-water in

the little creek just south of Dover.



Before daylight General Smith brought to me the following letter

from General Buckner:





HEADQUARTERS, FORT DONELSON,

February 16, 1862.



SIR:--In consideration of all the circumstances governing the

present situation of affairs at this station, I propose to the

Commanding Officer of the Federal forces the appointment of

Commissioners to agree upon terms of capitulation of the forces

and fort under my command, and in that view suggest an armistice

until 12 o'clock to-day.



I am, sir, very respectfully,

Your ob't se'v't,

S. B. BUCKNER,

Brig. Gen. C. S. A.



To Brigadier-General U. S. Grant,

Com'ding U. S. Forces,

Near Fort Donelson.





To this I responded as follows:





HEADQUARTERS ARMY IN THE FIELD,

Camp near Donelson,

February 16, 1862.



General S. B. BUCKNER,

Confederate Army.



SIR:--Yours of this date, proposing armistice and appointment of

Commissioners to settle terms of capitulation, is just

received.  No terms except an unconditional and immediate

surrender can be accepted.  I propose to move immediately upon

your works.



I am, sir, very respectfully,

Your ob't se'v't,

U. S. GRANT,

Brig. Gen.





To this I received the following reply:





HEADQUARTERS, DOVER, TENNESSEE,

February 16, 1862.



To Brig. Gen'I U. S. GRANT,

U. S. Army.



SIR:--The distribution of the forces under my command, incident

to an unexpected change of commanders, and the overwhelming

force under your command, compel me, notwithstanding the

brilliant success of the Confederate arms yesterday, to accept

the ungenerous and unchivalrous terms which you propose.



I am, sir,

Your very ob't se'v't,

S. B. BUCKNER,

Brig. Gen. C. S. A.





General Buckner, as soon as he had dispatched the first of the

above letters, sent word to his different commanders on the line

of rifle-pits, notifying them that he had made a proposition

looking to the surrender of the garrison, and directing them to

notify National troops in their front so that all fighting might

be prevented.  White flags were stuck at intervals along the line

of rifle-pits, but none over the fort.  As soon as the last

letter from Buckner was received I mounted my horse and rode to

Dover.  General Wallace, I found, had preceded me an hour or

more.  I presume that, seeing white flags exposed in his front,

he rode up to see what they meant and, not being fired upon or

halted, he kept on until he found himself at the headquarters of

General Buckner.



I had been at West Point three years with Buckner and afterwards

served with him in the army, so that we were quite well

acquainted.  In the course of our conversation, which was very

friendly, he said to me that if he had been in command I would

not have got up to Donelson as easily as I did.  I told him that

if he had been in command I should not have tried in the way I

did:  I had invested their lines with a smaller force than they

had to defend them, and at the same time had sent a brigade full

5,000 strong, around by water; I had relied very much upon their

commander to allow me to come safely up to the outside of their

works.  I asked General Buckner about what force he had to

surrender.  He replied that he could not tell with any degree of

accuracy; that all the sick and weak had been sent to Nashville

while we were about Fort Henry; that Floyd and Pillow had left

during the night, taking many men with them; and that Forrest,

and probably others, had also escaped during the preceding

night:  the number of casualties he could not tell; but he said

I would not find fewer than 12,000, nor more than 15,000.



He asked permission to send parties outside of the lines to bury

his dead, who had fallen on the 15th when they tried to get

out.  I gave directions that his permit to pass our limits

should be recognized.  I have no reason to believe that this

privilege was abused, but it familiarized our guards so much

with the sight of Confederates passing to and fro that I have no

doubt many got beyond our pickets unobserved and went on.  The

most of the men who went in that way no doubt thought they had

had war enough, and left with the intention of remaining out of

the army.  Some came to me and asked permission to go, saying

that they were tired of the war and would not be caught in the

ranks again, and I bade them go.



The actual number of Confederates at Fort Donelson can never be

given with entire accuracy.  The largest number admitted by any

writer on the Southern side, is by Colonel Preston Johnston.  He

gives the number at 17,000.  But this must be an underestimate.

The commissary general of prisoners reported having issued

rations to 14,623 Fort Donelson prisoners at Cairo, as they

passed that point.  General Pillow reported the killed and

wounded at 2,000; but he had less opportunity of knowing the

actual numbers than the officers of McClernand's division, for

most of the killed and wounded fell outside their works, in

front of that division, and were buried or cared for by Buckner

after the surrender and when Pillow was a fugitive.  It is known

that Floyd and Pillow escaped during the night of the 15th,

taking with them not less than 3,000 men.  Forrest escaped with

about 1,000 and others were leaving singly and in squads all

night.  It is probable that the Confederate force at Donelson,

on the 15th of February, 1862, was 21,000 in round numbers.



On the day Fort Donelson fell I had 27,000 men to confront the

Confederate lines and guard the road four or five miles to the

left, over which all our supplies had to be drawn on wagons.

During the 16th, after the surrender, additional reinforcements

arrived.



During the siege General Sherman had been sent to Smithland, at

the mouth of the Cumberland River, to forward reinforcements and

supplies to me.  At that time he was my senior in rank and there

was no authority of law to assign a junior to command a senior

of the same grade.  But every boat that came up with supplies or

reinforcements brought a note of encouragement from Sherman,

asking me to call upon him for any assistance he could render

and saying that if he could be of service at the front I might

send for him and he would waive rank.
