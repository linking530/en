MARCH TO JALAPA--BATTLE OF CERRO GORDO--PEROTE--PUEBLA --SCOTT

AND TAYLOR.



General Scott had less than twelve thousand men at Vera Cruz. He

had been promised by the administration a very much larger force,

or claimed that he had, and he was a man of veracity. Twelve

thousand was a very small army with which to penetrate two

hundred and sixty miles into an enemy's country, and to besiege

the capital; a city, at that time, of largely over one hundred

thousand inhabitants.  Then, too, any line of march that could

be selected led through mountain passes easily defended. In

fact, there were at that time but two roads from Vera Cruz to

the City of Mexico that could be taken by an army; one by Jalapa

and Perote, the other by Cordova and Orizaba, the two coming

together on the great plain which extends to the City of Mexico

after the range of mountains is passed.



It was very important to get the army away from Vera Cruz as

soon as possible, in order to avoid the yellow fever, or vomito,

which usually visits that city early in the year, and is very

fatal to persons not acclimated; but transportation, which was

expected from the North, was arriving very slowly.  It was

absolutely necessary to have enough to supply the army to

Jalapa, sixty-five miles in the interior and above the fevers of

the coast.  At that point the country is fertile, and an army of

the size of General Scott's could subsist there for an

indefinite period.  Not counting the sick, the weak and the

garrisons for the captured city and fort, the moving column was

now less than ten thousand strong.  This force was composed of

three divisions, under Generals Twiggs, Patterson, and Worth.

The importance of escaping the vomito was so great that as soon

as transportation enough could be got together to move a

division the advance was commenced.  On the 8th of April,

Twiggs's division started for Jalapa.  He was followed very soon

by Patterson, with his division.  General Worth was to bring up

the rear with his command as soon as transportation enough was

assembled to carry six days' rations for his troops with the

necessary ammunition and camp and garrison equipage.  It was the

13th of April before this division left Vera Cruz.



The leading division ran against the enemy at Cerro Gordo, some

fifty miles west, on the road to Jalapa, and went into camp at

Plan del Rio, about three miles from the fortifications. General

Patterson reached Plan del Rio with his division soon after

Twiggs arrived.  The two were then secure against an attack from

Santa Anna, who commanded the Mexican forces.  At all events they

confronted the enemy without reinforcements and without

molestation, until the 18th of April.  General Scott had

remained at Vera Cruz to hasten preparations for the field; but

on the 12th, learning the situation at the front, he hastened on

to take personal supervision.  He at once commenced his

preparations for the capture of the position held by Santa Anna

and of the troops holding it.



Cerro Gordo is one of the higher spurs of the mountains some

twelve to fifteen miles east of Jalapa, and Santa Anna had

selected this point as the easiest to defend against an invading

army.  The road, said to have been built by Cortez, zigzags

around the mountain-side and was defended at every turn by

artillery.  On either side were deep chasms or mountain walls. A

direct attack along the road was an impossibility.  A flank

movement seemed equally impossible.  After the arrival of the

commanding-general upon the scene, reconnoissances were sent out

to find, or to make, a road by which the rear of the enemy's

works might be reached without a front attack.  These

reconnoissances were made under the supervision of Captain

Robert E. Lee, assisted by Lieutenants P. G. T. Beauregard,

Isaac I. Stevens, Z. B. Tower, G. W. Smith, George B. McClellan,

and J. G. Foster, of the corps of engineers, all officers who

attained rank and fame, on one side or the other, in the great

conflict for the preservation of the unity of the nation.  The

reconnoissance was completed, and the labor of cutting out and

making roads by the flank of the enemy was effected by the 17th

of the month.  This was accomplished without the knowledge of

Santa Anna or his army, and over ground where he supposed it

impossible.  On the same day General Scott issued his order for

the attack on the 18th.



The attack was made as ordered, and perhaps there was not a

battle of the Mexican war, or of any other, where orders issued

before an engagement were nearer being a correct report of what

afterwards took place.  Under the supervision of the engineers,

roadways had been opened over chasms to the right where the

walls were so steep that men could barely climb them.  Animals

could not.  These had been opened under cover of night, without

attracting the notice of the enemy.  The engineers, who had

directed the opening, led the way and the troops followed.

Artillery was let down the steep slopes by hand, the men engaged

attaching a strong rope to the rear axle and letting the guns

down, a piece at a time, while the men at the ropes kept their

ground on top, paying out gradually, while a few at the front

directed the course of the piece.  In like manner the guns were

drawn by hand up the opposite slopes.  In this way Scott's

troops reached their assigned position in rear of most of the

intrenchments of the enemy, unobserved.  The attack was made,

the Mexican reserves behind the works beat a hasty retreat, and

those occupying them surrendered.  On the left General Pillow's

command made a formidable demonstration, which doubtless held a

part of the enemy in his front and contributed to the victory. I

am not pretending to give full details of all the battles fought,

but of the portion that I saw.  There were troops engaged on both

sides at other points in which both sustained losses; but the

battle was won as here narrated.



The surprise of the enemy was complete, the victory

overwhelming; some three thousand prisoners fell into Scott's

hands, also a large amount of ordnance and ordnance stores.  The

prisoners were paroled, the artillery parked and the small arms

and ammunition destroyed.  The battle of Buena Vista was

probably very important to the success of General Scott at Cerro

Gordo and in his entire campaign from Vera Cruz to the great

plains reaching to the City of Mexico.  The only army Santa Anna

had to protect his capital and the mountain passes west of Vera

Cruz, was the one he had with him confronting General Taylor. It

is not likely that he would have gone as far north as Monterey to

attack the United States troops when he knew his country was

threatened with invasion further south.  When Taylor moved to

Saltillo and then advanced on to Buena Vista, Santa Anna crossed

the desert confronting the invading army, hoping no doubt to

crush it and get back in time to meet General Scott in the

mountain passes west of Vera Cruz.  His attack on Taylor was

disastrous to the Mexican army, but, notwithstanding this, he

marched his army to Cerro Gordo, a distance not much short of

one thousand miles by the line he had to travel, in time to

intrench himself well before Scott got there.  If he had been

successful at Buena Vista his troops would no doubt have made a

more stubborn resistance at Cerro Gordo.  Had the battle of

Buena Vista not been fought Santa Anna would have had time to

move leisurely to meet the invader further south and with an

army not demoralized nor depleted by defeat.



After the battle the victorious army moved on to Jalapa, where

it was in a beautiful, productive and healthy country, far above

the fevers of the coast.  Jalapa, however, is still in the

mountains, and between there and the great plain the whole line

of the road is easy of defence.  It was important, therefore, to

get possession of the great highway between the sea-coast and the

capital up to the point where it leaves the mountains, before the

enemy could have time to re-organize and fortify in our front.

Worth's division was selected to go forward to secure this

result.  The division marched to Perote on the great plain, not

far from where the road debouches from the mountains.  There is

a low, strong fort on the plain in front of the town, known as

the Castle of Perote.  This, however, offered no resistance and

fell into our hands, with its armament.



General Scott having now only nine or ten thousand men west of

Vera Cruz, and the time of some four thousand of them being

about to expire, a long delay was the consequence.  The troops

were in a healthy climate, and where they could subsist for an

indefinite period even if their line back to Vera Cruz should be

cut off.  It being ascertained that the men whose time would

expire before the City of Mexico could possibly fall into the

hands of the American army, would not remain beyond the term for

which they had volunteered, the commanding-general determined to

discharge them at once, for a delay until the expiration of

their time would have compelled them to pass through Vera Cruz

during the season of the vomito.  This reduced Scott's force in

the field to about five thousand men.



Early in May, Worth, with his division, left Perote and marched

on to Puebla.  The roads were wide and the country open except

through one pass in a spur of mountains coming up from the

south, through which the road runs.  Notwithstanding this the

small column was divided into two bodies, moving a day apart.

Nothing occurred on the march of special note, except that while

lying at the town of Amozoque--an easy day's march east of

Puebla--a body of the enemy's cavalry, two or three thousand

strong, was seen to our right, not more than a mile away.  A

battery or two, with two or three infantry regiments, was sent

against them and they soon disappeared.  On the 15th of May we

entered the city of Puebla.



General Worth was in command at Puebla until the latter end of

May, when General Scott arrived.  Here, as well as on the march

up, his restlessness, particularly under responsibilities,

showed itself.  During his brief command he had the enemy

hovering around near the city, in vastly superior numbers to his

own.  The brigade to which I was attached changed quarters three

different times in about a week, occupying at first quarters

near the plaza, in the heart of the city; then at the western

entrance; then at the extreme east.  On one occasion General

Worth had the troops in line, under arms, all day, with three

days' cooked rations in their haversacks.  He galloped from one

command to another proclaiming the near proximity of Santa Anna

with an army vastly superior to his own.  General Scott arrived

upon the scene the latter part of the month, and nothing more

was heard of Santa Anna and his myriads.  There were, of course,

bodies of mounted Mexicans hovering around to watch our movements

and to pick up stragglers, or small bodies of troops, if they

ventured too far out.  These always withdrew on the approach of

any considerable number of our soldiers.  After the arrival of

General Scott I was sent, as quartermaster, with a large train

of wagons, back two days' march at least, to procure forage.  We

had less than a thousand men as escort, and never thought of

danger.  We procured full loads for our entire train at two

plantations, which could easily have furnished as much more.



There had been great delay in obtaining the authority of

Congress for the raising of the troops asked for by the

administration.  A bill was before the National Legislature from

early in the session of 1846-7, authorizing the creation of ten

additional regiments for the war to be attached to the regular

army, but it was the middle of February before it became a

law.  Appointments of commissioned officers had then to be made;

men had to be enlisted, the regiments equipped and the whole

transported to Mexico.  It was August before General Scott

received reinforcement sufficient to warrant an advance.  His

moving column, not even now more than ten thousand strong, was

in four divisions, commanded by Generals Twiggs, Worth, Pillow

and Quitman.  There was also a cavalry corps under General

Harney, composed of detachments of the 1st, 2d, and 3d

dragoons.  The advance commenced on the 7th of August with

Twiggs's division in front.  The remaining three divisions

followed, with an interval of a day between.  The marches were

short, to make concentration easier in case of attack.



I had now been in battle with the two leading commanders

conducting armies in a foreign land.  The contrast between the

two was very marked.  General Taylor never wore uniform, but

dressed himself entirely for comfort.  He moved about the field

in which he was operating to see through his own eyes the

situation.  Often he would be without staff officers, and when

he was accompanied by them there was no prescribed order in

which they followed.  He was very much given to sit his horse

side-ways--with both feet on one side--particularly on the

battlefield.  General Scott was the reverse in all these

particulars.  He always wore all the uniform prescribed or

allowed by law when he inspected his lines; word would be sent

to all division and brigade commanders in advance, notifying

them of the hour when the commanding general might be

expected.  This was done so that all the army might be under

arms to salute their chief as he passed.  On these occasions he

wore his dress uniform, cocked hat, aiguillettes, sabre and

spurs.  His staff proper, besides all officers constructively on

his staff--engineers, inspectors, quartermasters, etc., that

could be spared--followed, also in uniform and in prescribed

order.  Orders were prepared with great care and evidently with

the view that they should be a history of what followed.



In their modes of expressing thought, these two generals

contrasted quite as strongly as in their other

characteristics.  General Scott was precise in language,

cultivated a style peculiarly his own; was proud of his

rhetoric; not averse to speaking of himself, often in the third

person, and he could bestow praise upon the person he was

talking about without the least embarrassment.  Taylor was not a

conversationalist, but on paper he could put his meaning so

plainly that there could be no mistaking it.  He knew how to

express what he wanted to say in the fewest well-chosen words,

but would not sacrifice meaning to the construction of

high-sounding sentences.  But with their opposite

characteristics both were great and successful soldiers; both

were true, patriotic and upright in all their dealings.  Both

were pleasant to serve under--Taylor was pleasant to serve

with.  Scott saw more through the eyes of his staff officers

than through his own.  His plans were deliberately prepared, and

fully expressed in orders.  Taylor saw for himself, and gave

orders to meet the emergency without reference to how they would

read in history.
