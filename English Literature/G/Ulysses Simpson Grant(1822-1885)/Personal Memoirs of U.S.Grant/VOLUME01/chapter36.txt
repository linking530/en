BATTLE OF BLACK RIVER BRIDGE--CROSSING THE BIG BLACK--INVESTMENT

OF VICKSBURG--ASSAULTING THE WORKS.



We were now assured of our position between Johnston and

Pemberton, without a possibility of a junction of their

forces.  Pemberton might have made a night march to the Big

Black, crossed the bridge there and, by moving north on the west

side, have eluded us and finally returned to Johnston.  But this

would have given us Vicksburg.  It would have been his proper

move, however, and the one Johnston would have made had he been

in Pemberton's place.  In fact it would have been in conformity

with Johnston's orders to Pemberton.



Sherman left Jackson with the last of his troops about noon on

the 16th and reached Bolton, twenty miles west, before

halting.  His rear guard did not get in until two A.M. the 17th,

but renewed their march by daylight.  He paroled his prisoners at

Jackson, and was forced to leave his own wounded in care of

surgeons and attendants.  At Bolton he was informed of our

victory.  He was directed to commence the march early next day,

and to diverge from the road he was on to Bridgeport on the Big

Black River, some eleven miles above the point where we expected

to find the enemy.  Blair was ordered to join him there with the

pontoon train as early as possible.



This movement brought Sherman's corps together, and at a point

where I hoped a crossing of the Big Black might be effected and

Sherman's corps used to flank the enemy out of his position in

our front, thus opening a crossing for the remainder of the

army.  I informed him that I would endeavor to hold the enemy in

my front while he crossed the river.



The advance division, Carr's (McClernand's corps), resumed the

pursuit at half-past three A.M. on the 17th, followed closely by

Osterhaus, McPherson bringing up the rear with his corps.  As I

expected, the enemy was found in position on the Big Black.  The

point was only six miles from that where my advance had rested

for the night, and was reached at an early hour.  Here the river

makes a turn to the west, and has washed close up to the high

land; the east side is a low bottom, sometimes overflowed at

very high water, but was cleared and in cultivation.  A bayou

runs irregularly across this low land, the bottom of which,

however, is above the surface of the Big Black at ordinary

stages.  When the river is full water runs through it,

converting the point of land into an island.  The bayou was

grown up with timber, which the enemy had felled into the

ditch.  At this time there was a foot or two of water in it. The

rebels had constructed a parapet along the inner bank of this

bayou by using cotton bales from the plantation close by and

throwing dirt over them.  The whole was thoroughly commanded

from the height west of the river.  At the upper end of the

bayou there was a strip of uncleared land which afforded a cover

for a portion of our men.  Carr's division was deployed on our

right, Lawler's brigade forming his extreme right and reaching

through these woods to the river above.  Osterhaus' division was

deployed to the left of Carr and covered the enemy's entire

front.  McPherson was in column on the road, the head close by,

ready to come in wherever he could be of assistance.



While the troops were standing as here described an officer from

Banks' staff came up and presented me with a letter from General

Halleck, dated the 11th of May.  It had been sent by the way of

New Orleans to Banks to be forwarded to me.  It ordered me to

return to Grand Gulf and to co-operate from there with Banks

against Port Hudson, and then to return with our combined forces

to besiege Vicksburg.  I told the officer that the order came too

late, and that Halleck would not give it now if he knew our

position.  The bearer of the dispatch insisted that I ought to

obey the order, and was giving arguments to support his position

when I heard great cheering to the right of our line and, looking

in that direction, saw Lawler in his shirt sleeves leading a

charge upon the enemy.  I immediately mounted my horse and rode

in the direction of the charge, and saw no more of the officer

who delivered the dispatch; I think not even to this day.



The assault was successful.  But little resistance was made. The

enemy fled from the west bank of the river, burning the bridge

behind him and leaving the men and guns on the east side to fall

into our hands.  Many tried to escape by swimming the river. 

Some succeeded and some were drowned in the attempt. Eighteen

guns were captured and 1,751 prisoners.  Our loss was 39 killed,

237 wounded and 3 missing.  The enemy probably lost but few men

except those captured and drowned.  But for the successful and

complete destruction of the bridge, I have but little doubt that

we should have followed the enemy so closely as to prevent his

occupying his defences around Vicksburg.



As the bridge was destroyed and the river was high, new bridges

had to be built.  It was but little after nine o'clock A.M. when

the capture took place.  As soon as work could be commenced,

orders were given for the construction of three bridges.  One

was taken charge of by Lieutenant Hains, of the Engineer Corps,

one by General McPherson himself and one by General Ransom, a

most gallant and intelligent volunteer officer.  My recollection

is that Hains built a raft bridge; McPherson a pontoon, using

cotton bales in large numbers, for pontoons; and that Ransom

felled trees on opposite banks of the river, cutting only on one

side of the tree, so that they would fall with their tops

interlacing in the river, without the trees being entirely

severed from their stumps.  A bridge was then made with these

trees to support the roadway.  Lumber was taken from buildings,

cotton gins and wherever found, for this purpose.  By eight

o'clock in the morning of the 18th all three bridges were

complete and the troops were crossing.



Sherman reached Bridgeport about noon of the 17th and found

Blair with the pontoon train already there.  A few of the enemy

were intrenched on the west bank, but they made little

resistance and soon surrendered.  Two divisions were crossed

that night and the third the following morning.



On the 18th I moved along the Vicksburg road in advance of the

troops and as soon as possible joined Sherman.  My first anxiety

was to secure a base of supplies on the Yazoo River above

Vicksburg.  Sherman's line of march led him to the very point on

Walnut Hills occupied by the enemy the December before when he

was repulsed.  Sherman was equally anxious with myself.  Our

impatience led us to move in advance of the column and well up

with the advanced skirmishers.  There were some detached works

along the crest of the hill.  These were still occupied by the

enemy, or else the garrison from Haines' Bluff had not all got

past on their way to Vicksburg.  At all events the bullets of

the enemy whistled by thick and fast for a short time.  In a few

minutes Sherman had the pleasure of looking down from the spot

coveted so much by him the December before on the ground where

his command had lain so helpless for offensive action.  He

turned to me, saying that up to this minute he had felt no

positive assurance of success.  This, however, he said was the

end of one of the greatest campaigns in history and I ought to

make a report of it at once.  Vicksburg was not yet captured,

and there was no telling what might happen before it was taken;

but whether captured or not, this was a complete and successful

campaign.  I do not claim to quote Sherman's language; but the

substance only.  My reason for mentioning this incident will

appear further on.



McPherson, after crossing the Big Black, came into the Jackson

and Vicksburg road which Sherman was on, but to his rear.  He

arrived at night near the lines of the enemy, and went into

camp.  McClernand moved by the direct road near the railroad to

Mount Albans, and then turned to the left and put his troops on

the road from Baldwin's ferry to Vicksburg.  This brought him

south of McPherson.  I now had my three corps up the works built

for the defence of Vicksburg, on three roads--one to the north,

one to the east and one to the south-east of the city.  By the

morning of the 19th the investment was as complete as my limited

number of troops would allow.  Sherman was on the right, and

covered the high ground from where it overlooked the Yazoo as

far south-east as his troops would extend.  McPherson joined on

to his left, and occupied ground on both sides of the Jackson

road.  McClernand took up the ground to his left and extended as

far towards Warrenton as he could, keeping a continuous line.



On the 19th there was constant skirmishing with the enemy while

we were getting into better position.  The enemy had been much

demoralized by his defeats at Champion's Hill and the Big Black,

and I believed he would not make much effort to hold Vicksburg.

Accordingly, at two o'clock I ordered an assault.  It resulted

in securing more advanced positions for all our troops where

they were fully covered from the fire of the enemy.



The 20th and 21st were spent in strengthening our position and

in making roads in rear of the army, from Yazoo River or

Chickasaw Bayou.  Most of the army had now been for three weeks

with only five days' rations issued by the commissary.  They had

an abundance of food, however, but began to feel the want of

bread.  I remember that in passing around to the left of the

line on the 21st, a soldier, recognizing me, said in rather a

low voice, but yet so that I heard him, "Hard tack."  In a

moment the cry was taken up all along the line, "Hard tack! Hard

tack!" I told the men nearest to me that we had been engaged ever

since the arrival of the troops in building a road over which to

supply them with everything they needed.  The cry was instantly

changed to cheers.  By the night of the 21st all the troops had

full rations issued to them.  The bread and coffee were highly

appreciated.



I now determined on a second assault.  Johnston was in my rear,

only fifty miles away, with an army not much inferior in numbers

to the one I had with me, and I knew he was being reinforced.

There was danger of his coming to the assistance of Pemberton,

and after all he might defeat my anticipations of capturing the

garrison if, indeed, he did not prevent the capture of the

city.  The immediate capture of Vicksburg would save sending me

the reinforcements which were so much wanted elsewhere, and

would set free the army under me to drive Johnston from the

State.  But the first consideration of all was--the troops

believed they could carry the works in their front, and would

not have worked so patiently in the trenches if they had not

been allowed to try.



The attack was ordered to commence on all parts of the line at

ten o'clock A.M. on the 22d with a furious cannonade from every

battery in position.  All the corps commanders set their time by

mine so that all might open the engagement at the same minute.

The attack was gallant, and portions of each of the three corps

succeeded in getting up to the very parapets of the enemy and in

planting their battle flags upon them; but at no place were we

able to enter.  General McClernand reported that he had gained

the enemy's intrenchments at several points, and wanted

reinforcements.  I occupied a position from which I believed I

could see as well as he what took place in his front, and I did

not see the success he reported.  But his request for

reinforcements being repeated I could not ignore it, and sent

him Quinby's division of the 17th corps.  Sherman and McPherson

were both ordered to renew their assaults as a diversion in

favor of McClernand.  This last attack only served to increase

our casualties without giving any benefit whatever.  As soon as

it was dark our troops that had reached the enemy's line and

been obliged to remain there for security all day, were

withdrawn; and thus ended the last assault upon Vicksburg.
