My position at Corinth, with a nominal command and yet no

command, became so unbearable that I asked permission of Halleck

to remove my headquarters to Memphis.  I had repeatedly asked,

between the fall of Donelson and the evacuation of Corinth, to

be relieved from duty under Halleck; but all my applications

were refused until the occupation of the town.  I then obtained

permission to leave the department, but General Sherman happened

to call on me as I was about starting and urged me so strongly

not to think of going, that I concluded to remain.  My

application to be permitted to remove my headquarters to Memphis

was, however, approved, and on the 21st of June I started for

that point with my staff and a cavalry escort of only a part of

one company.  There was a detachment of two or three companies

going some twenty-five miles west to be stationed as a guard to

the railroad.  I went under cover of this escort to the end of

their march, and the next morning proceeded to La Grange with no

convoy but the few cavalry men I had with me.



From La Grange to Memphis the distance is forty-seven miles.

There were no troops stationed between these two points, except

a small force guarding a working party which was engaged in

repairing the railroad.  Not knowing where this party would be

found I halted at La Grange.  General Hurlbut was in command

there at the time and had his headquarters tents pitched on the

lawn of a very commodious country house.  The proprietor was at

home and, learning of my arrival, he invited General Hurlbut and

me to dine with him.  I accepted the invitation and spent a very

pleasant afternoon with my host, who was a thorough Southern

gentleman fully convinced of the justice of secession.  After

dinner, seated in the capacious porch, he entertained me with a

recital of the services he was rendering the cause.  He was too

old to be in the ranks himself--he must have been quite seventy

then--but his means enabled him to be useful in other ways.  In

ordinary times the homestead where he was now living produced

the bread and meat to supply the slaves on his main plantation,

in the low-lands of Mississippi.  Now he raised food and forage

on both places, and thought he would have that year a surplus

sufficient to feed three hundred families of poor men who had

gone into the war and left their families dependent upon the

"patriotism" of those better off.  The crops around me looked

fine, and I had at the moment an idea that about the time they

were ready to be gathered the "Yankee" troops would be in the

neighborhood and harvest them for the benefit of those engaged

in the suppression of the rebellion instead of its support.  I

felt, however, the greatest respect for the candor of my host

and for his zeal in a cause he thoroughly believed in, though

our views were as wide apart as it is possible to conceive.



The 23d of June, 1862, on the road from La Grange to Memphis was

very warm, even for that latitude and season.  With my staff and

small escort I started at an early hour, and before noon we

arrived within twenty miles of Memphis.  At this point I saw a

very comfortable-looking white-haired gentleman seated at the

front of his house, a little distance from the road.  I let my

staff and escort ride ahead while I halted and, for an excuse,

asked for a glass of water.  I was invited at once to dismount

and come in.  I found my host very genial and communicative, and

staid longer than I had intended, until the lady of the house

announced dinner and asked me to join them.  The host, however,

was not pressing, so that I declined the invitation and,

mounting my horse, rode on.



About a mile west from where I had been stopping a road comes up

from the southeast, joining that from La Grange to Memphis.  A

mile west of this junction I found my staff and escort halted

and enjoying the shade of forest trees on the lawn of a house

located several hundred feet back from the road, their horses

hitched to the fence along the line of the road.  I, too,

stopped and we remained there until the cool of the afternoon,

and then rode into Memphis.



The gentleman with whom I had stopped twenty miles from Memphis

was a Mr. De Loche, a man loyal to the Union.  He had not

pressed me to tarry longer with him because in the early part of

my visit a neighbor, a Dr. Smith, had called and, on being

presented to me, backed off the porch as if something had hit

him.  Mr. De Loche knew that the rebel General Jackson was in

that neighborhood with a detachment of cavalry.  His neighbor

was as earnest in the southern cause as was Mr. De Loche in that

of the Union.  The exact location of Jackson was entirely unknown

to Mr. De Loche; but he was sure that his neighbor would know it

and would give information of my presence, and this made my stay

unpleasant to him after the call of Dr. Smith.



I have stated that a detachment of troops was engaged in

guarding workmen who were repairing the railroad east of

Memphis.  On the day I entered Memphis, Jackson captured a small

herd of beef cattle which had been sent east for the troops so

engaged.  The drovers were not enlisted men and he released

them.  A day or two after one of these drovers came to my

headquarters and, relating the circumstances of his capture,

said Jackson was very much disappointed that he had not captured

me; that he was six or seven miles south of the Memphis and

Charleston railroad when he learned that I was stopping at the

house of Mr. De Loche, and had ridden with his command to the

junction of the road he was on with that from La Grange and

Memphis, where he learned that I had passed three-quarters of an

hour before.  He thought it would be useless to pursue with jaded

horses a well-mounted party with so much of a start.  Had he gone

three-quarters of a mile farther he would have found me with my

party quietly resting under the shade of trees and without even

arms in our hands with which to defend ourselves.



General Jackson of course did not communicate his disappointment

at not capturing me to a prisoner, a young drover; but from the

talk among the soldiers the facts related were learned.  A day

or two later Mr. De Loche called on me in Memphis to apologize

for his apparent incivility in not insisting on my staying for

dinner.  He said that his wife accused him of marked

discourtesy, but that, after the call of his neighbor, he had

felt restless until I got away.  I never met General Jackson

before the war, nor during it, but have met him since at his

very comfortable summer home at Manitou Springs, Colorado.  I

reminded him of the above incident, and this drew from him the

response that he was thankful now he had not captured me.  I

certainly was very thankful too.



My occupation of Memphis as district headquarters did not last

long.  The period, however, was marked by a few incidents which

were novel to me.  Up to that time I had not occupied any place

in the South where the citizens were at home in any great

numbers.  Dover was within the fortifications at Fort Donelson,

and, as far as I remember, every citizen was gone.  There were

no people living at Pittsburg landing, and but very few at

Corinth.  Memphis, however, was a populous city, and there were

many of the citizens remaining there who were not only

thoroughly impressed with the justice of their cause, but who

thought that even the "Yankee soldiery" must entertain the same

views if they could only be induced to make an honest

confession.  It took hours of my time every day to listen to

complaints and requests.  The latter were generally reasonable,

and if so they were granted; but the complaints were not always,

or even often, well founded.  Two instances will mark the general

character.  First:  the officer who commanded at Memphis

immediately after the city fell into the hands of the National

troops had ordered one of the churches of the city to be opened

to the soldiers.  Army chaplains were authorized to occupy the

pulpit.  Second:  at the beginning of the war the Confederate

Congress had passed a law confiscating all property of "alien

enemies" at the South, including the debts of Southerners to

Northern men.  In consequence of this law, when Memphis was

occupied the provost-marshal had forcibly collected all the

evidences he could obtain of such debts.



Almost the first complaints made to me were these two

outrages.  The gentleman who made the complaints informed me

first of his own high standing as a lawyer, a citizen and a

Christian.  He was a deacon in the church which had been defiled

by the occupation of Union troops, and by a Union chaplain

filling the pulpit.  He did not use the word "defile," but he

expressed the idea very clearly.  He asked that the church be

restored to the former congregation.  I told him that no order

had been issued prohibiting the congregation attending the

church.  He said of course the congregation could not hear a

Northern clergyman who differed so radically with them on

questions of government.  I told him the troops would continue

to occupy that church for the present, and that they would not

be called upon to hear disloyal sentiments proclaimed from the

pulpit.  This closed the argument on the first point.



Then came the second.  The complainant said that he wanted the

papers restored to him which had been surrendered to the

provost-marshal under protest; he was a lawyer, and before the

establishment of the "Confederate States Government" had been

the attorney for a number of large business houses at the North;

that "his government" had confiscated all debts due "alien

enemies," and appointed commissioners, or officers, to collect

such debts and pay them over to the "government":  but in his

case, owing to his high standing, he had been permitted to hold

these claims for collection, the responsible officials knowing

that he would account to the "government" for every dollar

received. He said that his "government," when it came in

possession of all its territory, would hold him personally

responsible for the claims he had surrendered to the provost-

marshal.  His impudence was so sublime that I was rather amused

than indignant.  I told him, however, that if he would remain in

Memphis I did not believe the Confederate government would ever

molest him.  He left, no doubt, as much amazed at my assurance

as I was at the brazenness of his request.



On the 11th of July General Halleck received telegraphic orders

appointing him to the command of all the armies, with

headquarters in Washington.  His instructions pressed him to

proceed to his new field of duty with as little delay as was

consistent with the safety and interests of his previous

command.  I was next in rank, and he telegraphed me the same day

to report at department headquarters at Corinth.  I was not

informed by the dispatch that my chief had been ordered to a

different field and did not know whether to move my headquarters

or not.  I telegraphed asking if I was to take my staff with me,

and received word in reply:  "This place will be your

headquarters.  You can judge for yourself."  I left Memphis for

my new field without delay, and reached Corinth on the 15th of

the month.  General Halleck remained until the 17th of July; but

he was very uncommunicative, and gave me no information as to

what I had been called to Corinth for.



When General Halleck left to assume the duties of

general-in-chief I remained in command of the district of West

Tennessee.  Practically I became a department commander, because

no one was assigned to that position over me and I made my

reports direct to the general-in-chief; but I was not assigned

to the position of department commander until the 25th of

October.  General Halleck while commanding the Department of the

Mississippi had had control as far east as a line drawn from

Chattanooga north.  My district only embraced West Tennessee and

Kentucky west of the Cumberland River.  Buell, with the Army of

the Ohio, had, as previously stated, been ordered east towards

Chattanooga, with instructions to repair the Memphis and

Charleston railroad as he advanced.  Troops had been sent north

by Halleck along the line of the Mobile and Ohio railroad to put

it in repair as far as Columbus.  Other troops were stationed on

the railroad from Jackson, Tennessee, to Grand Junction, and

still others on the road west to Memphis.



The remainder of the magnificent army of 120,000 men which

entered Corinth on the 30th of May had now become so scattered

that I was put entirely on the defensive in a territory whose

population was hostile to the Union.  One of the first things I

had to do was to construct fortifications at Corinth better

suited to the garrison that could be spared to man them.  The

structures that had been built during the months of May and June

were left as monuments to the skill of the engineer, and others

were constructed in a few days, plainer in design but suited to

the command available to defend them.



I disposed the troops belonging to the district in conformity

with the situation as rapidly as possible.  The forces at

Donelson, Clarksville and Nashville, with those at Corinth and

along the railroad eastward, I regarded as sufficient for

protection against any attack from the west.  The Mobile and

Ohio railroad was guarded from Rienzi, south of Corinth, to

Columbus; and the Mississippi Central railroad from Jackson,

Tennessee, to Bolivar.  Grand Junction and La Grange on the

Memphis railroad were abandoned.



South of the Army of the Tennessee, and confronting it, was Van

Dorn, with a sufficient force to organize a movable army of

thirty-five to forty thousand men, after being reinforced by

Price from Missouri.  This movable force could be thrown against

either Corinth, Bolivar or Memphis; and the best that could be

done in such event would be to weaken the points not threatened

in order to reinforce the one that was.  Nothing could be gained

on the National side by attacking elsewhere, because the

territory already occupied was as much as the force present

could guard.  The most anxious period of the war, to me, was

during the time the Army of the Tennessee was guarding the

territory acquired by the fall of Corinth and Memphis and before

I was sufficiently reinforced to take the offensive.  The enemy

also had cavalry operating in our rear, making it necessary to

guard every point of the railroad back to Columbus, on the

security of which we were dependent for all our supplies.

Headquarters were connected by telegraph with all points of the

command except Memphis and the Mississippi below Columbus.  With

these points communication was had by the railroad to Columbus,

then down the river by boat.  To reinforce Memphis would take

three or four days, and to get an order there for troops to move

elsewhere would have taken at least two days.  Memphis therefore

was practically isolated from the balance of the command.  But

it was in Sherman's hands.  Then too the troops were well

intrenched and the gunboats made a valuable auxiliary.



During the two months after the departure of General Halleck

there was much fighting between small bodies of the contending

armies, but these encounters were dwarfed by the magnitude of

the main battles so as to be now almost forgotten except by

those engaged in them.  Some of them, however, estimated by the

losses on both sides in killed and wounded, were equal in hard

fighting to most of the battles of the Mexican war which

attracted so much of the attention of the public when they

occurred.  About the 23d of July Colonel Ross, commanding at

Bolivar, was threatened by a large force of the enemy so that he

had to be reinforced from Jackson and Corinth.  On the 27th there

was skirmishing on the Hatchie River, eight miles from Bolivar.

On the 30th I learned from Colonel P. H. Sheridan, who had been

far to the south, that Bragg in person was at Rome, Georgia,

with his troops moving by rail (by way of Mobile) to Chattanooga

and his wagon train marching overland to join him at Rome.  Price

was at this time at Holly Springs, Mississippi, with a large

force, and occupied Grand Junction as an outpost.  I proposed to

the general-in-chief to be permitted to drive him away, but was

informed that, while I had to judge for myself, the best use to

make of my troops WAS NOT TO SCATTER THEM, but hold them ready

to reinforce Buell.



The movement of Bragg himself with his wagon trains to

Chattanooga across country, while his troops were transported

over a long round-about road to the same destination, without

need of guards except when in my immediate front, demonstrates

the advantage which troops enjoy while acting in a country where

the people are friendly.  Buell was marching through a hostile

region and had to have his communications thoroughly guarded

back to a base of supplies.  More men were required the farther

the National troops penetrated into the enemy's country.  I,

with an army sufficiently powerful to have destroyed Bragg, was

purely on the defensive and accomplishing no more than to hold a

force far inferior to my own.



On the 2d of August I was ordered from Washington to live upon

the country, on the resources of citizens hostile to the

government, so far as practicable.  I was also directed to

"handle rebels within our lines without gloves," to imprison

them, or to expel them from their homes and from our lines.  I

do not recollect having arrested and confined a citizen (not a

soldier) during the entire rebellion.  I am aware that a great

many were sent to northern prisons, particularly to Joliet,

Illinois, by some of my subordinates with the statement that it

was my order.  I had all such released the moment I learned of

their arrest; and finally sent a staff officer north to release

every prisoner who was said to be confined by my order.  There

were many citizens at home who deserved punishment because they

were soldiers when an opportunity was afforded to inflict an

injury to the National cause.  This class was not of the kind

that were apt to get arrested, and I deemed it better that a few

guilty men should escape than that a great many innocent ones

should suffer.



On the 14th of August I was ordered to send two more divisions

to Buell.  They were sent the same day by way of Decatur.  On

the 22d Colonel Rodney Mason surrendered Clarksville with six

companies of his regiment.



Colonel Mason was one of the officers who had led their

regiments off the field at almost the first fire of the rebels

at Shiloh.  He was by nature and education a gentleman, and was

terribly mortified at his action when the battle was over.  He

came to me with tears in his eyes and begged to be allowed to

have another trial.  I felt great sympathy for him and sent him,

with his regiment, to garrison Clarksville and Donelson.  He

selected Clarksville for his headquarters, no doubt because he

regarded it as the post of danger, it being nearer the enemy.

But when he was summoned to surrender by a band of guerillas,

his constitutional weakness overcame him.  He inquired the

number of men the enemy had, and receiving a response indicating

a force greater than his own he said if he could be satisfied of

that fact he would surrender.  Arrangements were made for him to

count the guerillas, and having satisfied himself that the enemy

had the greater force he surrendered and informed his

subordinate at Donelson of the fact, advising him to do the

same.  The guerillas paroled their prisoners and moved upon

Donelson, but the officer in command at that point marched out

to meet them and drove them away.



Among other embarrassments, at the time of which I now write,

was the fact that the government wanted to get out all the

cotton possible from the South and directed me to give every

facility toward that end.  Pay in gold was authorized, and

stations on the Mississippi River and on the railroad in our

possession had to be designated where cotton would be

received.  This opened to the enemy not only the means of

converting cotton into money, which had a value all over the

world and which they so much needed, but it afforded them means

of obtaining accurate and intelligent information in regard to

our position and strength.  It was also demoralizing to the

troops.  Citizens obtaining permits from the treasury department

had to be protected within our lines and given facilities to get

out cotton by which they realized enormous profits.  Men who had

enlisted to fight the battles of their country did not like to be

engaged in protecting a traffic which went to the support of an

enemy they had to fight, and the profits of which went to men

who shared none of their dangers.



On the 30th of August Colonel M. D. Leggett, near Bolivar, with

the 20th and 29th Ohio volunteer infantry, was attacked by a

force supposed to be about 4,000 strong.  The enemy was driven

away with a loss of more than one hundred men.  On the 1st of

September the bridge guard at Medon was attacked by guerillas.

The guard held the position until reinforced, when the enemy

were routed leaving about fifty of their number on the field

dead or wounded, our loss being only two killed and fifteen

wounded.  On the same day Colonel Dennis, with a force of less

than 500 infantry and two pieces of artillery, met the cavalry

of the enemy in strong force, a few miles west of Medon, and

drove them away with great loss.  Our troops buried 179 of the

enemy's dead, left upon the field.  Afterwards it was found that

all the houses in the vicinity of the battlefield were turned

into hospitals for the wounded.  Our loss, as reported at the

time, was forty-five killed and wounded.  On the 2d of September

I was ordered to send more reinforcements to Buell.  Jackson and

Bolivar were yet threatened, but I sent the reinforcements.  On

the 4th I received direct orders to send Granger's division also

to Louisville, Kentucky.



General Buell had left Corinth about the 10th of June to march

upon Chattanooga; Bragg, who had superseded Beauregard in

command, sent one division from Tupelo on the 27th of June for

the same place.  This gave Buell about seventeen days' start. If

he had not been required to repair the railroad as he advanced,

the march could have been made in eighteen days at the outside,

and Chattanooga must have been reached by the National forces

before the rebels could have possibly got there.  The road

between Nashville and Chattanooga could easily have been put in

repair by other troops, so that communication with the North

would have been opened in a short time after the occupation of

the place by the National troops.  If Buell had been permitted

to move in the first instance, with the whole of the Army of the

Ohio and that portion of the Army of the Mississippi afterwards

sent to him, he could have thrown four divisions from his own

command along the line of road to repair and guard it.



Granger's division was promptly sent on the 4th of September.  I

was at the station at Corinth when the troops reached that point,

and found General P. H. Sheridan with them.  I expressed surprise

at seeing him and said that I had not expected him to go.  He

showed decided disappointment at the prospect of being

detained.  I felt a little nettled at his desire to get away and

did not detain him.



Sheridan was a first lieutenant in the regiment in which I had

served eleven years, the 4th infantry, and stationed on the

Pacific coast when the war broke out.  He was promoted to a

captaincy in May, 1861, and before the close of the year managed

in some way, I do not know how, to get East.  He went to

Missouri.  Halleck had known him as a very successful young

officer in managing campaigns against the Indians on the Pacific

coast, and appointed him acting-quartermaster in south-west

Missouri.  There was no difficulty in getting supplies forward

while Sheridan served in that capacity; but he got into

difficulty with his immediate superiors because of his stringent

rules for preventing the use of public transportation for private

purposes.  He asked to be relieved from further duty in the

capacity in which he was engaged and his request was granted.

When General Halleck took the field in April, 1862, Sheridan was

assigned to duty on his staff.  During the advance on Corinth a

vacancy occurred in the colonelcy of the 2d Michigan cavalry.

Governor Blair, of Michigan, telegraphed General Halleck asking

him to suggest the name of a professional soldier for the

vacancy, saying he would appoint a good man without reference to

his State.  Sheridan was named; and was so conspicuously

efficient that when Corinth was reached he was assigned to

command a cavalry brigade in the Army of the Mississippi.  He

was in command at Booneville on the 1st of July with two small

regiments, when he was attacked by a force full three times as

numerous as his own.  By very skilful manoeuvres and boldness of

attack he completely routed the enemy.  For this he was made a

brigadier-general and became a conspicuous figure in the army

about Corinth.  On this account I was sorry to see him leaving

me.  His departure was probably fortunate, for he rendered

distinguished services in his new field.



Granger and Sheridan reached Louisville before Buell got there,

and on the night of their arrival Sheridan with his command

threw up works around the railroad station for the defence of

troops as they came from the front.
