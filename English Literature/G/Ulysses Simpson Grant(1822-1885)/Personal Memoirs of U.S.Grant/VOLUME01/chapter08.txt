ADVANCE ON MONTEREY--THE BLACK FORT--THE BATTLE OF

MONTEREY--SURRENDER OF THE CITY.



The advance from Camargo was commenced on the 5th of September.

The army was divided into four columns, separated from each

other by one day's march.  The advance reached Cerralvo in four

days and halted for the remainder of the troops to come up.  By

the 13th the rear-guard had arrived, and the same day the

advance resumed its march, followed as before, a day separating

the divisions.  The forward division halted again at Marin,

twenty-four miles from Monterey.  Both this place and Cerralvo

were nearly deserted, and men, women and children were seen

running and scattered over the hills as we approached; but when

the people returned they found all their abandoned property

safe, which must have given them a favorable opinion of Los

Grengos--"the Yankees."  From Marin the movement was in mass. 

On the 19th General Taylor, with is army, was encamped at Walnut

Springs, within three miles of Monterey.



The town is on a small stream coming out of the mountain-pass,

and is backed by a range of hills of moderate elevation.  To the

north, between the city and Walnut Springs, stretches an

extensive plain.  On this plain, and entirely outside of the

last houses of the city, stood a strong fort, enclosed on all

sides, to which our army gave the name of "Black Fort."  Its

guns commanded the approaches to the city to the full extent of

their range.  There were two detached spurs of hills or

mountains to the north and northwest of the city, which were

also fortified.  On one of these stood the Bishop's Palace.  The

road to Saltillo leaves the upper or western end of the city

under the fire of the guns from these heights.  The lower or

eastern end was defended by two or three small detached works,

armed with artillery and infantry.  To the south was the

mountain stream before mentioned, and back of that the range of

foot-hills.  The plaza in the centre of the city was the

citadel, properly speaking.  All the streets leading from it

were swept by artillery, cannon being intrenched behind

temporary parapets. The house-tops near the plaza were converted

into infantry fortifications by the use of sand-bags for

parapets.  Such were the defences of Monterey in September,

1847.  General Ampudia, with a force of certainly ten thousand

men, was in command.



General Taylor's force was about six thousand five hundred

strong, in three divisions, under Generals Butler, Twiggs and

Worth.  The troops went into camp at Walnut Springs, while the

engineer officers, under Major Mansfield--a General in the late

war--commenced their reconnoissance.  Major Mansfield found that

it would be practicable to get troops around, out of range of the

Black Fort and the works on the detached hills to the north-west

of the city, to the Saltillo road.  With this road in our

possession, the enemy would be cut off from receiving further

supplies, if not from all communication with the interior.

General Worth, with his division somewhat reinforced, was given

the task of gaining possession of the Saltillo road, and of

carrying the detached works outside the city, in that quarter.

He started on his march early in the afternoon of the 20th.  The

divisions under Generals Butler and Twiggs were drawn up to

threaten the east and north sides of the city and the works on

those fronts, in support of the movement under General Worth.

Worth's was regarded as the main attack on Monterey, and all

other operations were in support of it.  His march this day was

uninterrupted; but the enemy was seen to reinforce heavily about

the Bishop's Palace and the other outside fortifications on their

left.  General Worth reached a defensible position just out of

range of the enemy's guns on the heights north-west of the city,

and bivouacked for the night.  The engineer officers with

him--Captain Sanders and Lieutenant George G. Meade, afterwards

the commander of the victorious National army at the battle of

Gettysburg--made a reconnoissance to the Saltillo road under

cover of night.



During the night of the 20th General Taylor had established a

battery, consisting of two twenty-four-pounder howitzers and a

ten inch mortar, at a point from which they could play upon

Black Fort.  A natural depression in the plain, sufficiently

deep to protect men standing in it from the fire from the fort,

was selected and the battery established on the crest nearest

the enemy.  The 4th infantry, then consisting of but six reduced

companies, was ordered to support the artillerists while they

were intrenching themselves and their guns.  I was regimental

quartermaster at the time and was ordered to remain in charge of

camp and the public property at Walnut Springs.  It was supposed

that the regiment would return to its camp in the morning.



The point for establishing the siege battery was reached and the

work performed without attracting the attention of the enemy.  At

daylight the next morning fire was opened on both sides and

continued with, what seemed to me at that day, great fury.  My

curiosity got the better of my judgment, and I mounted a horse

and rode to the front to see what was going on.  I had been

there but a short time when an order to charge was given, and

lacking the moral courage to return to camp--where I had been

ordered to stay--I charged with the regiment As soon as the

troops were out of the depression they came under the fire of

Black Fort.  As they advanced they got under fire from batteries

guarding the cast, or lower, end of the city, and of musketry.

About one-third of the men engaged in the charge were killed or

wounded in the space of a few minutes.  We retreated to get out

of fire, not backward, but eastward and perpendicular to the

direct road running into the city from Walnut Springs.  I was, I

believe, the only person in the 4th infantry in the charge who

was on horseback.  When we got to a lace of safety the regiment

halted and drew itself together--what was left of it.  The

adjutant of the regiment, Lieutenant Hoskins, who was not in

robust health, found himself very much fatigued from running on

foot in the charge and retreat, and, seeing me on horseback,

expressed a wish that he could be mounted also.  I offered him

my horse and he accepted the offer.  A few minutes later I saw a

soldier, a quartermaster's man, mounted, not far away.  I ran to

him, took his horse and was back with the regiment in a few

minutes.  In a short time we were off again; and the next place

of safety from the shots of the enemy that I recollect of being

in, was a field of cane or corn to the north-east of the lower

batteries.  The adjutant to whom I had loaned my horse was

killed, and I was designated to act in his place.



This charge was ill-conceived, or badly executed.  We belonged

to the brigade commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Garland, and he

had received orders to charge the lower batteries of the city,

and carry them if he could without too much loss, for the

purpose of creating a diversion in favor of Worth, who was

conducting the movement which it was intended should be

decisive.  By a movement by the left flank Garland could have

led his men beyond the range of the fire from Black Fort and

advanced towards the northeast angle of the city, as well

covered from fire as could be expected.  There was no undue loss

of life in reaching the lower end of Monterey, except that

sustained by Garland's command.



Meanwhile Quitman's brigade, conducted by an officer of

engineers, had reached the eastern end of the city, and was

placed under cover of the houses without much loss.  Colonel

Garland's brigade also arrived at the suburbs, and, by the

assistance of some of our troops that had reached house-tops

from which they could fire into a little battery covering the

approaches to the lower end of the city, the battery was

speedily captured and its guns were turned upon another work of

the enemy.  An entrance into the cast end of the city was now

secured, and the houses protected our troops so long as they

were inactive.  On the west General Worth had reached the

Saltillo road after some fighting but without heavy loss.  He

turned from his new position and captured the forts on both

heights in that quarter.  This gave him possession of the upper

or west end of Monterey.  Troops from both Twiggs's and Butler's

divisions were in possession of the east end of the town, but the

Black Fort to the north of the town and the plaza in the centre

were still in the possession of the enemy.  Our camps at Walnut

Springs, three miles away, were guarded by a company from each

regiment.  A regiment of Kentucky volunteers guarded the mortars

and howitzers engaged against Black Fort.  Practically Monterey

was invested.



There was nothing done on the 22d by the United States troops;

but the enemy kept up a harmless fire upon us from Black Fort

and the batteries still in their possession at the east end of

the city.  During the night they evacuated these; so that on the

morning of the 23d we held undisputed possession of the east end

of Monterey.



Twiggs's division was at the lower end of the city, and well

covered from the fire of the enemy.  But the streets leading to

the plaza--all Spanish or Spanish-American towns have near their

centres a square called a plaza--were commanded from all

directions by artillery.  The houses were flat-roofed and but

one or two stories high, and about the plaza the roofs were

manned with infantry, the troops being protected from our fire

by parapets made of sand-bags.  All advances into the city were

thus attended with much danger.  While moving along streets

which did not lead to the plaza, our men were protected from the

fire, and from the view, of the enemy except at the crossings;

but at these a volley of musketry and a discharge of grape-shot

were invariably encountered.  The 3d and 4th regiments of

infantry made an advance nearly to the plaza in this way and

with heavy loss.  The loss of the 3d infantry in commissioned

officers was especially severe.  There were only five companies

of the regiment and not over twelve officers present, and five

of these officers were killed.  When within a square of the

plaza this small command, ten companies in all, was brought to a

halt.  Placing themselves under cover from the shots of the

enemy, the men would watch to detect a head above the sand-bags

on the neighboring houses.  The exposure of a single head would

bring a volley from our soldiers.



We had not occupied this position long when it was discovered

that our ammunition was growing low.  I volunteered to go back

(*2) to the point we had started from, report our position to

General Twiggs, and ask for ammunition to be forwarded.  We were

at this time occupying ground off from the street, in rear of the

houses.  My ride back was an exposed one.  Before starting I

adjusted myself on the side of my horse furthest from the enemy,

and with only one foot holding to the cantle of the saddle, and

an arm over the neck of the horse exposed, I started at full

run.  It was only at street crossings that my horse was under

fire, but these I crossed at such a flying rate that generally I

was past and under cover of the next block of houses before the

enemy fired.  I got out safely without a scratch.



At one place on my ride, I saw a sentry walking in front of a

house, and stopped to inquire what he was doing there.  Finding

that the house was full of wounded American officers and

soldiers, I dismounted and went in.  I found there Captain

Williams, of the Engineer Corps, wounded in the head, probably

fatally, and Lieutenant Territt, also badly wounded his bowels

protruding from his wound.  There were quite a number of

soldiers also.  Promising them to report their situation, I

left, readjusted myself to my horse, recommenced the run, and

was soon with the troops at the east end.  Before ammunition

could be collected, the two regiments I had been with were seen

returning, running the same gauntlet in getting out that they

had passed in going in, but with comparatively little loss.  The

movement was countermanded and the troops were withdrawn.  The

poor wounded officers and men I had found, fell into the hands

of the enemy during the night, and died.



While this was going on at the east, General Worth, with a small

division of troops, was advancing towards the plaza from the

opposite end of the city.  He resorted to a better expedient for

getting to the plaza--the citadel--than we did on the east.

Instead of moving by the open streets, he advanced through the

houses, cutting passageways from one to another.  Without much

loss of life, he got so near the plaza during the night that

before morning, Ampudia, the Mexican commander, made overtures

for the surrender of the city and garrison.  This stopped all

further hostilities.  The terms of surrender were soon agreed

upon.  The prisoners were paroled and permitted to take their

horses and personal property with them.



My pity was aroused by the sight of the Mexican garrison of

Monterey marching out of town as prisoners, and no doubt the

same feeling was experienced by most of our army who witnessed

it.  Many of the prisoners were cavalry, armed with lances, and

mounted on miserable little half-starved horses that did not

look as if they could carry their riders out of town.  The men

looked in but little better condition.  I thought how little

interest the men before me had in the results of the war, and

how little knowledge they had of "what it was all about."



After the surrender of the garrison of Monterey a quiet camp

life was led until midwinter.  As had been the case on the Rio

Grande, the people who remained at their homes fraternized with

the "Yankees" in the pleasantest manner.  In fact, under the

humane policy of our commander, I question whether the great

majority of the Mexican people did not regret our departure as

much as they had regretted our coming.  Property and person were

thoroughly protected, and a market was afforded for all the

products of the country such as the people had never enjoyed

before.  The educated and wealthy portion of the population

here, as elsewhere, abandoned their homes and remained away from

them as long as they were in the possession of the invaders; but

this class formed a very small percentage of the whole

population.
