GENERAL FREMONT IN COMMAND--MOVEMENT AGAINST BELMONT-- BATTLE OF

BELMONT--A NARROW ESCAPE--AFTER THE BATTLE.



From the occupation of Paducah up to the early part of November

nothing important occurred with the troops under my command.  I

was reinforced from time to time and the men were drilled and

disciplined preparatory for the service which was sure to

come.  By the 1st of November I had not fewer than 20,000 men,

most of them under good drill and ready to meet any equal body

of men who, like themselves, had not yet been in an

engagement.  They were growing impatient at lying idle so long,

almost in hearing of the guns of the enemy they had volunteered

to fight against.  I asked on one or two occasions to be allowed

to move against Columbus.  It could have been taken soon after

the occupation of Paducah; but before November it was so

strongly fortified that it would have required a large force and

a long siege to capture it.



In the latter part of October General Fremont took the field in

person and moved from Jefferson City against General Sterling

Price, who was then in the State of Missouri with a considerable

command.  About the first of November I was directed from

department headquarters to make a demonstration on both sides of

the Mississippi River with the view of detaining the rebels at

Columbus within their lines.  Before my troops could be got off,

I was notified from the same quarter that there were some 3,000

of the enemy on the St. Francis River about fifty miles west, or

south-west, from Cairo, and was ordered to send another force

against them.  I dispatched Colonel Oglesby at once with troops

sufficient to compete with the reported number of the enemy.  On

the 5th word came from the same source that the rebels were about

to detach a large force from Columbus to be moved by boats down

the Mississippi and up the White River, in Arkansas, in order to

reinforce Price, and I was directed to prevent this movement if

possible.  I accordingly sent a regiment from Bird's Point under

Colonel W. H. L. Wallace to overtake and reinforce Oglesby, with

orders to march to New Madrid, a point some distance below

Columbus, on the Missouri side.  At the same time I directed

General C. F. Smith to move all the troops he could spare from

Paducah directly against Columbus, halting them, however, a few

miles from the town to await further orders from me.  Then I

gathered up all the troops at Cairo and Fort Holt, except

suitable guards, and moved them down the river on steamers

convoyed by two gunboats, accompanying them myself.  My force

consisted of a little over 3,000 men and embraced five regiments

of infantry, two guns and two companies of cavalry.  We dropped

down the river on the 6th to within about six miles of Columbus,

debarked a few men on the Kentucky side and established pickets

to connect with the troops from Paducah.



I had no orders which contemplated an attack by the National

troops, nor did I intend anything of the kind when I started out

from Cairo; but after we started I saw that the officers and men

were elated at the prospect of at last having the opportunity of

doing what they had volunteered to do--fight the enemies of their

country.  I did not see how I could maintain discipline, or

retain the confidence of my command, if we should return to

Cairo without an effort to do something.  Columbus, besides

being strongly fortified, contained a garrison much more

numerous than the force I had with me.  It would not do,

therefore, to attack that point.  About two o'clock on the

morning of the 7th, I learned that the enemy was crossing troops

from Columbus to the west bank to be dispatched, presumably,

after Oglesby.  I knew there was a small camp of Confederates at

Belmont, immediately opposite Columbus, and I speedily resolved

to push down the river, land on the Missouri side, capture

Belmont, break up the camp and return.  Accordingly, the pickets

above Columbus were drawn in at once, and about daylight the

boats moved out from shore.  In an hour we were debarking on the

west bank of the Mississippi, just out of range of the batteries

at Columbus.



The ground on the west shore of the river, opposite Columbus, is

low and in places marshy and cut up with sloughs.  The soil is

rich and the timber large and heavy.  There were some small

clearings between Belmont and the point where we landed, but

most of the country was covered with the native forests.  We

landed in front of a cornfield.  When the debarkation commenced,

I took a regiment down the river to post it as a guard against

surprise.  At that time I had no staff officer who could be

trusted with that duty.  In the woods, at a short distance below

the clearing, I found a depression, dry at the time, but which at

high water became a slough or bayou.  I placed the men in the

hollow, gave them their instructions and ordered them to remain

there until they were properly relieved.  These troops, with the

gunboats, were to protect our transports.



Up to this time the enemy had evidently failed to divine our

intentions.  From Columbus they could, of course, see our

gunboats and transports loaded with troops.  But the force from

Paducah was threatening them from the land side, and it was

hardly to be expected that if Columbus was our object we would

separate our troops by a wide river.  They doubtless thought we

meant to draw a large force from the east bank, then embark

ourselves, land on the east bank and make a sudden assault on

Columbus before their divided command could be united.



About eight o'clock we started from the point of debarkation,

marching by the flank.  After moving in this way for a mile or a

mile and a half, I halted where there was marshy ground covered

with a heavy growth of timber in our front, and deployed a large

part of my force as skirmishers.  By this time the enemy

discovered that we were moving upon Belmont and sent out troops

to meet us.  Soon after we had started in line, his skirmishers

were encountered and fighting commenced.  This continued,

growing fiercer and fiercer, for about four hours, the enemy

being forced back gradually until he was driven into his camp.

Early in this engagement my horse was shot under me, but I got

another from one of my staff and kept well up with the advance

until the river was reached.



The officers and men engaged at Belmont were then under fire for

the first time.  Veterans could not have behaved better than they

did up to the moment of reaching the rebel camp.  At this point

they became demoralized from their victory and failed to reap

its full reward.  The enemy had been followed so closely that

when he reached the clear ground on which his camp was pitched

he beat a hasty retreat over the river bank, which protected him

from our shots and from view.  This precipitate retreat at the

last moment enabled the National forces to pick their way

without hinderance through the abatis--the only artificial

defence the enemy had.  The moment the camp was reached our men

laid down their arms and commenced rummaging the tents to pick

up trophies.  Some of the higher officers were little better

than the privates.  They galloped about from one cluster of men

to another and at every halt delivered a short eulogy upon the

Union cause and the achievements of the command.



All this time the troops we had been engaged with for four

hours, lay crouched under cover of the river bank, ready to come

up and surrender if summoned to do so; but finding that they were

not pursued, they worked their way up the river and came up on

the bank between us and our transports.  I saw at the same time

two steamers coming from the Columbus side towards the west

shore, above us, black--or gray--with soldiers from boiler-deck

to roof.  Some of my men were engaged in firing from captured

guns at empty steamers down the river, out of range, cheering at

every shot.  I tried to get them to turn their guns upon the

loaded steamers above and not so far away.  My efforts were in

vain.  At last I directed my staff officers to set fire to the

camps.  This drew the fire of the enemy's guns located on the

heights of Columbus.  They had abstained from firing before,

probably because they were afraid of hitting their own men; or

they may have supposed, until the camp was on fire, that it was

still in the possession of their friends.  About this time, too,

the men we had driven over the bank were seen in line up the

river between us and our transports.  The alarm "surrounded" was

given.  The guns of the enemy and the report of being surrounded,

brought officers and men completely under control.  At first some

of the officers seemed to think that to be surrounded was to be

placed in a hopeless position, where there was nothing to do but

surrender.  But when I announced that we had cut our way in and

could cut our way out just as well, it seemed a new revelation

to officers and soldiers.  They formed line rapidly and we

started back to our boats, with the men deployed as skirmishers

as they had been on entering camp.  The enemy was soon

encountered, but his resistance this time was feeble.  Again the

Confederates sought shelter under the river banks.  We could not

stop, however, to pick them up, because the troops we had seen

crossing the river had debarked by this time and were nearer our

transports than we were.  It would be prudent to get them behind

us; but we were not again molested on our way to the boats.



From the beginning of the fighting our wounded had been carried

to the houses at the rear, near the place of debarkation.  I now

set the troops to bringing their wounded to the boats.  After

this had gone on for some little time I rode down the road,

without even a staff officer, to visit the guard I had stationed

over the approach to our transports.  I knew the enemy had

crossed over from Columbus in considerable numbers and might be

expected to attack us as we were embarking.  This guard would be

encountered first and, as they were in a natural intrenchment,

would be able to hold the enemy for a considerable time.  My

surprise was great to find there was not a single man in the

trench.  Riding back to the boat I found the officer who had

commanded the guard and learned that he had withdrawn his force

when the main body fell back.  At first I ordered the guard to

return, but finding that it would take some time to get the men

together and march them back to their position, I countermanded

the order.  Then fearing that the enemy we had seen crossing the

river below might be coming upon us unawares, I rode out in the

field to our front, still entirely alone, to observe whether the

enemy was passing.  The field was grown up with corn so tall and

thick as to cut off the view of even a person on horseback,

except directly along the rows.  Even in that direction, owing

to the overhanging blades of corn, the view was not extensive. I

had not gone more than a few hundred yards when I saw a body of

troops marching past me not fifty yards away.  I looked at them

for a moment and then turned my horse towards the river and

started back, first in a walk, and when I thought myself

concealed from the view of the enemy, as fast as my horse could

carry me.  When at the river bank I still had to ride a few

hundred yards to the point where the nearest transport lay.



The cornfield in front of our transports terminated at the edge

of a dense forest.  Before I got back the enemy had entered this

forest and had opened a brisk fire upon the boats.  Our men, with

the exception of details that had gone to the front after the

wounded, were now either aboard the transports or very near

them.  Those who were not aboard soon got there, and the boats

pushed off.  I was the only man of the National army between the

rebels and our transports.  The captain of a boat that had just

pushed out but had not started, recognized me and ordered the

engineer not to start the engine; he then had a plank run out

for me.  My horse seemed to take in the situation.  There was no

path down the bank and every one acquainted with the Mississippi

River knows that its banks, in a natural state, do not vary at

any great angle from the perpendicular.  My horse put his fore

feet over the bank without hesitation or urging, and with his

hind feet well under him, slid down the bank and trotted aboard

the boat, twelve or fifteen feet away, over a single gang

plank.  I dismounted and went at once to the upper deck.



The Mississippi River was low on the 7th of November, 1861, so

that the banks were higher than the heads of men standing on the

upper decks of the steamers.  The rebels were some distance back

from the river, so that their fire was high and did us but

little harm.  Our smoke-stack was riddled with bullets, but

there were only three men wounded on the boats, two of whom were

soldiers.  When I first went on deck I entered the captain's room

adjoining the pilot-house, and threw myself on a sofa.  I did not

keep that position a moment, but rose to go out on the deck to

observe what was going on.  I had scarcely left when a musket

ball entered the room, struck the head of the sofa, passed

through it and lodged in the foot.



When the enemy opened fire on the transports our gunboats

returned it with vigor.  They were well out in the stream and

some distance down, so that they had to give but very little

elevation to their guns to clear the banks of the river.  Their

position very nearly enfiladed the line of the enemy while he

was marching through the cornfield.  The execution was very

great, as we could see at the time and as I afterwards learned

more positively.  We were very soon out of range and went

peacefully on our way to Cairo, every man feeling that Belmont

was a great victory and that he had contributed his share to it.



Our loss at Belmont was 485 in killed, wounded and missing.

About 125 of our wounded fell into the hands of the enemy.  We

returned with 175 prisoners and two guns, and spiked four other

pieces.  The loss of the enemy, as officially reported, was 642

men, killed, wounded and missing.  We had engaged about 2,500

men, exclusive of the guard left with the transports.  The enemy

had about 7,000; but this includes the troops brought over from

Columbus who were not engaged in the first defence of Belmont.



The two objects for which the battle of Belmont was fought were

fully accomplished.  The enemy gave up all idea of detaching

troops from Columbus.  His losses were very heavy for that

period of the war.  Columbus was beset by people looking for

their wounded or dead kin, to take them home for medical

treatment or burial.  I learned later, when I had moved further

south, that Belmont had caused more mourning than almost any

other battle up to that time.  The National troops acquired a

confidence in themselves at Belmont that did not desert them

through the war.



The day after the battle I met some officers from General Polk's

command, arranged for permission to bury our dead at Belmont and

also commenced negotiations for the exchange of prisoners.  When

our men went to bury their dead, before they were allowed to land

they were conducted below the point where the enemy had engaged

our transports.  Some of the officers expressed a desire to see

the field; but the request was refused with the statement that

we had no dead there.



While on the truce-boat I mentioned to an officer, whom I had

known both at West Point and in the Mexican war, that I was in

the cornfield near their troops when they passed; that I had

been on horseback and had worn a soldier's overcoat at the

time.  This officer was on General Polk's staff.  He said both

he and the general had seen me and that Polk had said to his

men, "There is a Yankee; you may try your marksmanship on him if

you wish," but nobody fired at me.



Belmont was severely criticised in the North as a wholly

unnecessary battle, barren of results, or the possibility of

them from the beginning.  If it had not been fought, Colonel

Oglesby would probably have been captured or destroyed with his

three thousand men.  Then I should have been culpable indeed.
