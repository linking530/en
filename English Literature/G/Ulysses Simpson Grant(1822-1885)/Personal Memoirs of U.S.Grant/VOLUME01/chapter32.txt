THE BAYOUS WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI--CRITICISMS OF THE  NORTHERN

PRESS--RUNNING THE BATTERIES--LOSS OF THE INDIANOLA--DISPOSITION

OF THE TROOPS.



The original canal scheme was also abandoned on the 27th of

March.  The effort to make a waterway through Lake Providence

and the connecting bayous was abandoned as wholly impracticable

about the same time.



At Milliken's Bend, and also at Young's Point, bayous or

channels start, which connecting with other bayous passing

Richmond, Louisiana, enter the Mississippi at Carthage

twenty-five or thirty miles above Grand Gulf.  The Mississippi

levee cuts the supply of water off from these bayous or

channels, but all the rainfall behind the levee, at these

points, is carried through these same channels to the river

below.  In case of a crevasse in this vicinity, the water

escaping would find its outlet through the same channels.  The

dredges and laborers from the canal having been driven out by

overflow and the enemy's batteries, I determined to open these

other channels, if possible.  If successful the effort would

afford a route, away from the enemy's batteries, for our

transports.  There was a good road back of the levees, along

these bayous, to carry the troops, artillery and wagon trains

over whenever the water receded a little, and after a few days

of dry weather.  Accordingly, with the abandonment of all the

other plans for reaching a base heretofore described, this new

one was undertaken.



As early as the 4th of February I had written to Halleck about

this route, stating that I thought it much more practicable than

the other undertaking (the Lake Providence route), and that it

would have been accomplished with much less labor if commenced

before the water had got all over the country.



The upper end of these bayous being cut off from a water supply,

further than the rainfall back of the levees, was grown up with

dense timber for a distance of several miles from their

source.  It was necessary, therefore, to clear this out before

letting in the water from the river.  This work was continued

until the waters of the river began to recede and the road to

Richmond, Louisiana, emerged from the water.  One small steamer

and some barges were got through this channel, but no further

use could be made of it because of the fall in the river. Beyond

this it was no more successful than the other experiments with

which the winter was whiled away.  All these failures would have

been very discouraging if I had expected much from the efforts;

but I had not.  From the first the most I hoped to accomplish

was the passage of transports, to be used below Vicksburg,

without exposure to the long line of batteries defending that

city.



This long, dreary and, for heavy and continuous rains and high

water, unprecedented winter was one of great hardship to all

engaged about Vicksburg.  The river was higher than its natural

banks from December, 1862, to the following April.  The war had

suspended peaceful pursuits in the South, further than the

production of army supplies, and in consequence the levees were

neglected and broken in many places and the whole country was

covered with water.  Troops could scarcely find dry ground on

which to pitch their tents.  Malarial fevers broke out among the

men.  Measles and small-pox also attacked them.  The hospital

arrangements and medical attendance were so perfect, however,

that the loss of life was much less than might have been

expected.  Visitors to the camps went home with dismal stories

to relate; Northern papers came back to the soldiers with these

stories exaggerated.  Because I would not divulge my ultimate

plans to visitors, they pronounced me idle, incompetent and

unfit to command men in an emergency, and clamored for my

removal.  They were not to be satisfied, many of them, with my

simple removal, but named who my successor should be.

McClernand, Fremont, Hunter and McClellan were all mentioned in

this connection.  I took no steps to answer these complaints,

but continued to do my duty, as I understood it, to the best of

my ability.  Every one has his superstitions.  One of mine is

that in positions of great responsibility every one should do

his duty to the best of his ability where assigned by competent

authority, without application or the use of influence to change

his position.  While at Cairo I had watched with very great

interest the operations of the Army of the Potomac, looking upon

that as the main field of the war.  I had no idea, myself, of

ever having any large command, nor did I suppose that I was

equal to one; but I had the vanity to think that as a cavalry

officer I might succeed very well in the command of a brigade.

On one occasion, in talking about this to my staff officers, all

of whom were civilians without any military education whatever, I

said that I would give anything if I were commanding a brigade of

cavalry in the Army of the Potomac and I believed I could do some

good.  Captain Hillyer spoke up and suggested that I make

application to be transferred there to command the cavalry.  I

then told him that I would cut my right arm off first, and

mentioned this superstition.



In time of war the President, being by the Constitution

Commander-in-chief of the Army and Navy, is responsible for the

selection of commanders.  He should not be embarrassed in making

his selections.  I having been selected, my responsibility ended

with my doing the best I knew how.  If I had sought the place,

or obtained it through personal or political influence, my

belief is that I would have feared to undertake any plan of my

own conception, and would probably have awaited direct orders

from my distant superiors.  Persons obtaining important commands

by application or political influence are apt to keep a written

record of complaints and predictions of defeat, which are shown

in case of disaster.  Somebody must be responsible for their

failures.



With all the pressure brought to bear upon them, both President

Lincoln and General Halleck stood by me to the end of the

campaign.  I had never met Mr.  Lincoln, but his support was

constant.



At last the waters began to recede; the roads crossing the

peninsula behind the levees of the bayous, were emerging from

the waters; the troops were all concentrated from distant points

at Milliken's Bend preparatory to a final move which was to crown

the long, tedious and discouraging labors with success.



I had had in contemplation the whole winter the movement by land

to a point below Vicksburg from which to operate, subject only to

the possible but not expected success of some one of the

expedients resorted to for the purpose of giving us a different

base.  This could not be undertaken until the waters receded.  I

did not therefore communicate this plan, even to an officer of my

staff, until it was necessary to make preparations for the

start.  My recollection is that Admiral Porter was the first one

to whom I mentioned it.  The co-operation of the navy was

absolutely essential to the success (even to the contemplation)

of such an enterprise.  I had no more authority to command

Porter than he had to command me.  It was necessary to have part

of his fleet below Vicksburg if the troops went there.  Steamers

to use as ferries were also essential.  The navy was the only

escort and protection for these steamers, all of which in

getting below had to run about fourteen miles of batteries.

Porter fell into the plan at once, and suggested that he had

better superintend the preparation of the steamers selected to

run the batteries, as sailors would probably understand the work

better than soldiers.  I was glad to accept his proposition, not

only because I admitted his argument, but because it would

enable me to keep from the enemy a little longer our designs.

Porter's fleet was on the east side of the river above the mouth

of the Yazoo, entirely concealed from the enemy by the dense

forests that intervened.  Even spies could not get near him, on

account of the undergrowth and overflowed lands.  Suspicions of

some mysterious movements were aroused.  Our river guards

discovered one day a small skiff moving quietly and mysteriously

up the river near the east shore, from the direction of

Vicksburg, towards the fleet.  On overhauling the boat they

found a small white flag, not much larger than a handkerchief,

set up in the stern, no doubt intended as a flag of truce in

case of discovery.  The boat, crew and passengers were brought

ashore to me.  The chief personage aboard proved to be Jacob

Thompson, Secretary of the Interior under the administration of

President Buchanan.  After a pleasant conversation of half an

hour or more I allowed the boat and crew, passengers and all, to

return to Vicksburg, without creating a suspicion that there was

a doubt in my mind as to the good faith of Mr. Thompson and his

flag.



Admiral Porter proceeded with the preparation of the steamers

for their hazardous passage of the enemy's batteries.  The great

essential was to protect the boilers from the enemy's shot, and

to conceal the fires under the boilers from view.  This he

accomplished by loading the steamers, between the guards and

boilers on the boiler deck up to the deck above, with bales of

hay and cotton, and the deck in front of the boilers in the same

way, adding sacks of grain.  The hay and grain would be wanted

below, and could not be transported in sufficient quantity by

the muddy roads over which we expected to march.



Before this I had been collecting, from St. Louis and Chicago,

yawls and barges to be used as ferries when we got below.  By

the 16th of April Porter was ready to start on his perilous

trip.  The advance, flagship Benton, Porter commanding, started

at ten o'clock at night, followed at intervals of a few minutes

by the Lafayette with a captured steamer, the Price, lashed to

her side, the Louisville, Mound City, Pittsburgh and

Carondelet--all of these being naval vessels.  Next came the

transports--Forest Queen, Silver Wave and Henry Clay, each

towing barges loaded with coal to be used as fuel by the naval

and transport steamers when below the batteries.  The gunboat

Tuscumbia brought up the rear.  Soon after the start a battery

between Vicksburg and Warrenton opened fire across the

intervening peninsula, followed by the upper batteries, and then

by batteries all along the line.  The gunboats ran up close under

the bluffs, delivering their fire in return at short distances,

probably without much effect.  They were under fire for more

than two hours and every vessel was struck many times, but with

little damage to the gunboats.  The transports did not fare so

well.  The Henry Clay was disabled and deserted by her crew.

Soon after a shell burst in the cotton packed about the boilers,

set the vessel on fire and burned her to the water's edge.  The

burning mass, however, floated down to Carthage before

grounding, as did also one of the barges in tow.



The enemy were evidently expecting our fleet, for they were

ready to light up the river by means of bonfires on the east

side and by firing houses on the point of land opposite the city

on the Louisiana side.  The sight was magnificent, but

terrible.  I witnessed it from the deck of a river transport,

run out into the middle of the river and as low down as it was

prudent to go.  My mind was much relieved when I learned that no

one on the transports had been killed and but few, if any,

wounded.  During the running of the batteries men were stationed

in the holds of the transports to partially stop with cotton

shot-holes that might be made in the hulls.  All damage was

afterwards soon repaired under the direction of Admiral Porter.



The experiment of passing batteries had been tried before this,

however, during the war.  Admiral Farragut had run the batteries

at Port Hudson with the flagship Hartford and one iron-clad and

visited me from below Vicksburg.  The 13th of February Admiral

Porter had sent the gunboat Indianola, Lieutenant-Commander

George Brown commanding, below.  She met Colonel Ellet of the

Marine brigade below Natchez on a captured steamer.  Two of the

Colonel's fleet had previously run the batteries, producing the

greatest consternation among the people along the Mississippi

from Vicksburg (*10) to the Red River.



The Indianola remained about the mouth of the Red River some

days, and then started up the Mississippi.  The Confederates

soon raised the Queen of the West, (*11) and repaired her.  With

this vessel and the ram Webb, which they had had for some time in

the Red River, and two other steamers, they followed the

Indianola. The latter was encumbered with barges of coal in tow,

and consequently could make but little speed against the rapid

current of the Mississippi.  The Confederate fleet overtook her

just above Grand Gulf, and attacked her after dark on the 24th

of February.  The Indianola was superior to all the others in

armament, and probably would have destroyed them or driven them

away, but for her encumbrance.  As it was she fought them for an

hour and a half, but, in the dark, was struck seven or eight

times by the ram and other vessels, and was finally disabled and

reduced to a sinking condition.  The armament was thrown

overboard and the vessel run ashore.  Officers and crew then

surrendered.



I had started McClernand with his corps of four divisions on the

29th of March, by way of Richmond, Louisiana, to New Carthage,

hoping that he might capture Grand Gulf before the balance of

the troops could get there; but the roads were very bad,

scarcely above water yet.  Some miles from New Carthage the

levee to Bayou Vidal was broken in several places, overflowing

the roads for the distance of two miles.  Boats were collected

from the surrounding bayous, and some constructed on the spot

from such material as could be collected, to transport the

troops across the overflowed interval.  By the 6th of April

McClernand had reached New Carthage with one division and its

artillery, the latter ferried through the woods by these

boats.  On the 17th I visited New Carthage in person, and saw

that the process of getting troops through in the way we were

doing was so tedious that a better method must be devised.  The

water was falling, and in a few days there would not be depth

enough to use boats; nor would the land be dry enough to march

over.  McClernand had already found a new route from Smith's

plantation where the crevasse occurred, to Perkins' plantation,

eight to twelve miles below New Carthage.  This increased the

march from Milliken's Bend from twenty-seven to nearly forty

miles.  Four bridges had to be built across bayous, two of them

each over six hundred feet long, making about two thousand feet

of bridging in all.  The river falling made the current in these

bayous very rapid, increasing the difficulty of building and

permanently fastening these bridges; but the ingenuity of the

"Yankee soldier" was equal to any emergency.  The bridges were

soon built of such material as could be found near by, and so

substantial were they that not a single mishap occurred in

crossing all the army with artillery, cavalry and wagon trains,

except the loss of one siege gun (a thirty-two pounder).  This,

if my memory serves me correctly, broke through the only pontoon

bridge we had in all our march across the peninsula. These

bridges were all built by McClernand's command, under the

supervision of Lieutenant Hains of the Engineer Corps.



I returned to Milliken's Bend on the 18th or 19th, and on the

20th issued the following final order for the movement of troops:





HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE, MILLIKEN'S BEND,

LOUISIANA,

April 20, 1863.



Special Orders, No. 110.

         *         *         *         *         *        

*         * VIII.  The following orders are published for the

information and guidance of the "Army in the Field," in its

present movement to obtain a foothold on the east bank of the

Mississippi River, from which Vicksburg can be approached by

practicable roads.



First.--The Thirteenth army corps, Major-General John A.

McClernand commanding, will constitute the right wing.



Second.--The Fifteenth army corps, Major-General W. T. Sherman

commanding, will constitute the left wing.



Third.--The Seventeenth army corps, Major-General James B.

McPherson commanding, will constitute the centre.



Fourth.--The order of march to New Carthage will be from right

to left.



Fifth.--Reserves will be formed by divisions from each army

corps; or, an entire army corps will be held as a reserve, as

necessity may require.  When the reserve is formed by divisions,

each division will remain under the immediate command of its

respective corps commander, unless otherwise specially ordered

for a particular emergency.



Sixth.--Troops will be required to bivouac, until proper

facilities can be afforded for the transportation of camp

equipage.



Seventh.--In the present movement, one tent will be allowed to

each company for the protection of rations from rain; one wall

tent for each regimental headquarters; one wall tent for each

brigade headquarters; and one wall tent for each division

headquarters; corps commanders having the books and blanks of

their respective commands to provide for, are authorized to take

such tents as are absolutely necessary, but not to exceed the

number allowed by General Orders No. 160, A. G. O., series of

1862.



Eighth.--All the teams of the three army corps, under the

immediate charge of the quartermasters bearing them on their

returns, will constitute a train for carrying supplies and

ordnance and the authorized camp equipage of the army.



Ninth.--As fast as the Thirteenth army corps advances, the

Seventeenth army corps will take its place; and it, in turn,

will be followed in like manner by the Fifteenth army corps.



Tenth.--Two regiments from each army corps will be detailed by

corps commanders, to guard the lines from Richmond to New

Carthage.




Eleventh.--General hospitals will be established by the medical

director between Duckport and Milliken's Bend.  All sick and

disabled soldiers will be left in these hospitals.  Surgeons in

charge of hospitals will report convalescents as fast as they

become fit for duty.  Each corps commander will detail an

intelligent and good drill officer, to remain behind and take

charge of the convalescents of their respective corps; officers

so detailed will organize the men under their charge into squads

and companies, without regard to the regiments they belong to;

and in the absence of convalescent commissioned officers to

command them, will appoint non-commissioned officers or

privates.  The force so organized will constitute the guard of

the line from Duckport to Milliken's Bend.  They will furnish

all the guards and details required for general hospitals, and

with the contrabands that may be about the camps, will furnish

all the details for loading and unloading boats.



Twelfth.--The movement of troops from Milliken's Bend to New

Carthage will be so conducted as to allow the transportation of

ten days' supply of rations, and one-half the allowance of

ordnance, required by previous orders.



Thirteenth.--Commanders are authorized and enjoined to collect

all the beef cattle, corn and other necessary supplies on the

line of march; but wanton destruction of property, taking of

articles useless for military purposes, insulting citizens,

going into and searching houses without proper orders from

division commanders, are positively prohibited.  All such

irregularities must be summarily punished.



Fourteenth.--Brigadier-General J. C.  Sullivan is appointed to

the command of all the forces detailed for the protection of the

line from here to New Carthage.  His particular attention is

called to General Orders, No. 69, from Adjutant-General's

Office, Washington, of date March 20, 1863.



By order of

MAJOR-GENERAL U. S.  GRANT.





McClernand was already below on the Mississippi.  Two of

McPherson's divisions were put upon the march immediately.  The

third had not yet arrived from Lake Providence; it was on its

way to Milliken's Bend and was to follow on arrival.



Sherman was to follow McPherson.  Two of his divisions were at

Duckport and Young's Point, and the third under Steele was under

orders to return from Greenville, Mississippi, where it had been

sent to expel a rebel battery that had been annoying our

transports.



It had now become evident that the army could not be rationed by

a wagon train over the single narrow and almost impassable road

between Milliken's Bend and Perkins' plantation.  Accordingly

six more steamers were protected as before, to run the

batteries, and were loaded with supplies.  They took twelve

barges in tow, loaded also with rations.  On the night of the

22d of April they ran the batteries, five getting through more

or less disabled while one was sunk.  About half the barges got

through with their needed freight.



When it was first proposed to run the blockade at Vicksburg with

river steamers there were but two captains or masters who were

willing to accompany their vessels, and but one crew. Volunteers

were called for from the army, men who had had experience in any

capacity in navigating the western rivers. Captains, pilots,

mates, engineers and deck-hands enough presented themselves to

take five times the number of vessels we were moving through

this dangerous ordeal.  Most of them were from Logan's division,

composed generally of men from the southern part of Illinois and

from Missouri.  All but two of the steamers were commanded by

volunteers from the army, and all but one so manned.  In this

instance, as in all others during the war, I found that

volunteers could be found in the ranks and among the

commissioned officers to meet every call for aid whether

mechanical or professional.  Colonel W. S. Oliver was master of

transportation on this occasion by special detail.
