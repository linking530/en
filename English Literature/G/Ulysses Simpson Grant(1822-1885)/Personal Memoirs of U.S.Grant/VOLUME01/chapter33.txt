ATTACK ON GRAND GULF--OPERATIONS BELOW VICKSBURG.



On the 24th my headquarters were with the advance at Perkins'

plantation.  Reconnoissances were made in boats to ascertain

whether there was high land on the east shore of the river where

we might land above Grand Gulf.  There was none practicable.

Accordingly the troops were set in motion for Hard Times,

twenty-two miles farther down the river and nearly opposite

Grand Gulf.  The loss of two steamers and six barges reduced our

transportation so that only 10,000 men could be moved by water.

Some of the steamers that had got below were injured in their

machinery, so that they were only useful as barges towed by

those less severely injured.  All the troops, therefore, except

what could be transported in one trip, had to march.  The road

lay west of Lake St. Joseph.  Three large bayous had to be

crossed.  They were rapidly bridged in the same manner as those

previously encountered. (*12)



On the 27th McClernand's corps was all at Hard Times, and

McPherson's was following closely.  I had determined to make the

attempt to effect a landing on the east side of the river as soon

as possible.  Accordingly, on the morning of the 29th, McClernand

was directed to embark all the troops from his corps that our

transports and barges could carry.  About 10,000 men were so

embarked.  The plan was to have the navy silence the guns at

Grand Gulf, and to have as many men as possible ready to debark

in the shortest possible time under cover of the fire of the

navy and carry the works by storm.  The following order was

issued: 



PERKINS PLANTATION, LA.,

April 27,1863.



MAJOR-GENERAL J. A. MCCLERNAND,

Commanding 13th A. C.



Commence immediately the embarkation of your corps, or so much

of it as there is transportation for.  Have put aboard the

artillery and every article authorized in orders limiting

baggage, except the men, and hold them in readiness, with their

places assigned, to be moved at a moment's warning.



All the troops you may have, except those ordered to remain

behind, send to a point nearly opposite Grand Gulf, where you

see, by special orders of this date, General McPherson is

ordered to send one division.



The plan of the attack will be for the navy to attack and

silence all the batteries commanding the river.  Your corps will

be on the river, ready to run to and debark on the nearest

eligible land below the promontory first brought to view passing

down the river.  Once on shore, have each commander instructed

beforehand to form his men the best the ground will admit of,

and take possession of the most commanding points, but avoid

separating your command so that it cannot support itself.  The

first object is to get a foothold where our troops can maintain

themselves until such time as preparations can be made and

troops collected for a forward movement.



Admiral Porter has proposed to place his boats in the position

indicated to you a few days ago, and to bring over with them

such troops as may be below the city after the guns of the enemy

are silenced.



It may be that the enemy will occupy positions back from the

city, out of range of the gunboats, so as to make it desirable

to run past Grand Gulf and land at Rodney.  In case this should

prove the plan, a signal will be arranged and you duly informed,

when the transports are to start with this view.  Or, it may be

expedient for the boats to run past, but not the men.  In this

case, then, the transports would have to be brought back to

where the men could land and move by forced marches to below

Grand Gulf, re-embark rapidly and proceed to the latter place.

There will be required, then, three signals; one, to indicate

that the transports can run down and debark the troops at Grand

Gulf; one, that the transports can run by without the troops;

and the last, that the transports can run by with the troops on

board.



Should the men have to march, all baggage and artillery will be

left to run the blockade.



If not already directed, require your men to keep three days'

rations in their haversacks, not to be touched until a movement

commences.



U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.





At 8 o'clock A.M., 29th, Porter made the attack with his entire

strength present, eight gunboats.  For nearly five and a half

hours the attack was kept up without silencing a single gun of

the enemy.  All this time McClernand's 10,000 men were huddled

together on the transports in the stream ready to attempt a

landing if signalled.  I occupied a tug from which I could see

the effect of the battle on both sides, within range of the

enemy's guns; but a small tug, without armament, was not

calculated to attract the fire of batteries while they were

being assailed themselves.  About half-past one the fleet

withdrew, seeing their efforts were entirely unavailing.  The

enemy ceased firing as soon as we withdrew.  I immediately

signalled the Admiral and went aboard his ship.  The navy lost

in this engagement eighteen killed and fifty-six wounded.  A

large proportion of these were of the crew of the flagship, and

most of those from a single shell which penetrated the ship's

side and exploded between decks where the men were working their

guns.  The sight of the mangled and dying men which met my eye as

I boarded the ship was sickening.



Grand Gulf is on a high bluff where the river runs at the very

foot of it.  It is as defensible upon its front as Vicksburg

and, at that time, would have been just as impossible to capture

by a front attack.  I therefore requested Porter to run the

batteries with his fleet that night, and to take charge of the

transports, all of which would be wanted below.



There is a long tongue of land from the Louisiana side extending

towards Grand Gulf, made by the river running nearly east from

about three miles above and nearly in the opposite direction

from that point for about the same distance below.  The land was

so low and wet that it would not have been practicable to march

an army across but for a levee.  I had had this explored before,

as well as the east bank below to ascertain if there was a

possible point of debarkation north of Rodney.  It was found

that the top of the levee afforded a good road to march upon.



Porter, as was always the case with him, not only acquiesced in

the plan, but volunteered to use his entire fleet as

transports.  I had intended to make this request, but he

anticipated me.  At dusk, when concealed from the view of the

enemy at Grand Gulf, McClernand landed his command on the west

bank.  The navy and transports ran the batteries successfully.

The troops marched across the point of land under cover of

night, unobserved.  By the time it was light the enemy saw our

whole fleet, ironclads, gunboats, river steamers and barges,

quietly moving down the river three miles below them, black, or

rather blue, with National troops.



When the troops debarked, the evening of the 29th, it was

expected that we would have to go to Rodney, about nine miles

below, to find a landing; but that night a colored man came in

who informed me that a good landing would be found at

Bruinsburg, a few miles above Rodney, from which point there was

a good road leading to Port Gibson some twelve miles in the

interior.  The information was found correct, and our landing

was effected without opposition.



Sherman had not left his position above Vicksburg yet.  On the

morning of the 27th I ordered him to create a diversion by

moving his corps up the Yazoo and threatening an attack on

Haines' Bluff.



My object was to compel Pemberton to keep as much force about

Vicksburg as I could, until I could secure a good footing on

high land east of the river.  The move was eminently successful

and, as we afterwards learned, created great confusion about

Vicksburg and doubts about our real design.  Sherman moved the

day of our attack on Grand Gulf, the 29th, with ten regiments of

his command and eight gunboats which Porter had left above

Vicksburg.



He debarked his troops and apparently made every preparation to

attack the enemy while the navy bombarded the main forts at

Haines' Bluff.  This move was made without a single casualty in

either branch of the service.  On the first of May Sherman

received orders from me (sent from Hard Times the evening of the

29th of April) to withdraw from the front of Haines' Bluff and

follow McPherson with two divisions as fast as he could.



I had established a depot of supplies at Perkins' plantation.

Now that all our gunboats were below Grand Gulf it was possible

that the enemy might fit out boats in the Big Black with

improvised armament and attempt to destroy these supplies.

McPherson was at Hard Times with a portion of his corps, and the

depot was protected by a part of his command.  The night of the

29th I directed him to arm one of the transports with artillery

and send it up to Perkins' plantation as a guard; and also to

have the siege guns we had brought along moved there and put in

position.



The embarkation below Grand Gulf took place at De Shroon's,

Louisiana, six miles above Bruinsburg, Mississippi.  Early on

the morning of 30th of April McClernand's corps and one division

of McPherson's corps were speedily landed.



When this was effected I felt a degree of relief scarcely ever

equalled since.  Vicksburg was not yet taken it is true, nor

were its defenders demoralized by any of our previous moves.  I

was now in the enemy's country, with a vast river and the

stronghold of Vicksburg between me and my base of supplies.  But

I was on dry ground on the same side of the river with the

enemy.  All the campaigns, labors, hardships and exposures from

the month of December previous to this time that had been made

and endured, were for the accomplishment of this one object.



I had with me the 13th corps, General McClernand commanding, and

two brigades of Logan's division of the 17th corps, General

McPherson commanding--in all not more than twenty thousand men

to commence the campaign with.  These were soon reinforced by

the remaining brigade of Logan's division and Crocker's division

of the 17th corps.  On the 7th of May I was further reinforced by

Sherman with two divisions of his, the 15th corps.  My total

force was then about thirty-three thousand men.



The enemy occupied Grand Gulf, Haines' Bluff and Jackson with a

force of nearly sixty thousand men.  Jackson is fifty miles east

of Vicksburg and is connected with it by a railroad.  My first

problem was to capture Grand Gulf to use as a base.



Bruinsburg is two miles from high ground.  The bottom at that

point is higher than most of the low land in the valley of the

Mississippi, and a good road leads to the bluff.  It was natural

to expect the garrison from Grand Gulf to come out to meet us and

prevent, if they could, our reaching this solid base.  Bayou

Pierre enters the Mississippi just above Bruinsburg and, as it

is a navigable stream and was high at the time, in order to

intercept us they had to go by Port Gibson, the nearest point

where there was a bridge to cross upon.  This more than doubled

the distance from Grand Gulf to the high land back of

Bruinsburg.  No time was to be lost in securing this foothold.

Our transportation was not sufficient to move all the army

across the river at one trip, or even two; but the landing of

the 13th corps and one division of the 17th was effected during

the day, April 30th, and early evening.  McClernand was advanced

as soon as ammunition and two days' rations (to last five) could

be issued to his men.  The bluffs were reached an hour before

sunset and McClernand was pushed on, hoping to reach Port Gibson

and save the bridge spanning the Bayou Pierre before the enemy

could get there; for crossing a stream in the presence of an

enemy is always difficult.  Port Gibson, too, is the starting

point of roads to Grand Gulf, Vicksburg and Jackson.



McClernand's advance met the enemy about five miles west of Port

Gibson at Thompson's plantation.  There was some firing during

the night, but nothing rising to the dignity of a battle until

daylight.  The enemy had taken a strong natural position with

most of the Grand Gulf garrison, numbering about seven or eight

thousand men, under General Bowen.  His hope was to hold me in

check until reinforcements under Loring could reach him from

Vicksburg; but Loring did not come in time to render much

assistance south of Port Gibson.  Two brigades of McPherson's

corps followed McClernand as fast as rations and ammunition

could be issued, and were ready to take position upon the

battlefield whenever the 13th corps could be got out of the way.



The country in this part of Mississippi stands on edge, as it

were, the roads running along the ridges except when they

occasionally pass from one ridge to another.  Where there are no

clearings the sides of the hills are covered with a very heavy

growth of timber and with undergrowth, and the ravines are

filled with vines and canebrakes, almost impenetrable.  This

makes it easy for an inferior force to delay, if not defeat, a

far superior one.



Near the point selected by Bowen to defend, the road to Port

Gibson divides, taking two ridges which do not diverge more than

a mile or two at the widest point.  These roads unite just

outside the town.  This made it necessary for McClernand to

divide his force.  It was not only divided, but it was separated

by a deep ravine of the character above described.  One flank

could not reinforce the other except by marching back to the

junction of the roads.  McClernand put the divisions of Hovey,

Carr and A. J. Smith upon the right-hand branch and Osterhaus on

the left.  I was on the field by ten A.M., and inspected both

flanks in person.  On the right the enemy, if not being pressed

back, was at least not repulsing our advance.  On the left,

however, Osterhaus was not faring so well.  He had been repulsed

with some loss.  As soon as the road could be cleared of

McClernand's troops I ordered up McPherson, who was close upon

the rear of the 13th corps, with two brigades of Logan's

division.  This was about noon.  I ordered him to send one

brigade (General John E. Smith's was selected) to support

Osterhaus, and to move to the left and flank the enemy out of

his position.  This movement carried the brigade over a deep

ravine to a third ridge and, when Smith's troops were seen well

through the ravine, Osterhaus was directed to renew his front

attack.  It was successful and unattended by heavy loss.  The

enemy was sent in full retreat on their right, and their left

followed before sunset.  While the movement to our left was

going on, McClernand, who was with his right flank, sent me

frequent requests for reinforcements, although the force with

him was not being pressed.  I had been upon the ground and knew

it did not admit of his engaging all the men he had.  We

followed up our victory until night overtook us about two miles

from Port Gibson; then the troops went into bivouac for the

night.
