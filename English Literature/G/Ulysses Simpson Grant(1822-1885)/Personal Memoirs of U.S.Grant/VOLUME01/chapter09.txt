POLITICAL INTRIGUE--BUENA VISTA--MOVEMENT AGAINST VERA

CRUZ--SIEGE AND CAPTURE OF VERA CRUZ.



The Mexican war was a political war, and the administration

conducting it desired to make party capital out of it.  General

Scott was at the head of the army, and, being a soldier of

acknowledged professional capacity, his claim to the command of

the forces in the field was almost indisputable and does not

seem to have been denied by President Polk, or Marcy, his

Secretary of War.  Scott was a Whig and the administration was

democratic.  General Scott was also known to have political

aspirations, and nothing so popularizes a candidate for high

civil positions as military victories.  It would not do

therefore to give him command of the "army of conquest."  The

plans submitted by Scott for a campaign in Mexico were

disapproved by the administration, and he replied, in a tone

possibly a little disrespectful, to the effect that, if a

soldier's plans were not to be supported by the administration,

success could not be expected.  This was on the 27th of May,

1846.  Four days later General Scott was notified that he need

not go to Mexico.  General Gaines was next in rank, but he was

too old and feeble to take the field.  Colonel Zachary Taylor--a

brigadier-general by brevet--was therefore left in command.  He,

too, was a Whig, but was not supposed to entertain any political

ambitions; nor did he; but after the fall of Monterey, his third

battle and third complete victory, the Whig papers at home began

to speak of him as the candidate of their party for the

Presidency.  Something had to be done to neutralize his growing

popularity.  He could not be relieved from duty in the field

where all his battles had been victories:  the design would have

been too transparent.  It was finally decided to send General

Scott to Mexico in chief command, and to authorize him to carry

out his own original plan:  that is, capture Vera Cruz and march

upon the capital of the country.  It was no doubt supposed that

Scott's ambition would lead him to slaughter Taylor or destroy

his chances for the Presidency, and yet it was hoped that he

would not make sufficient capital himself to secure the prize.



The administration had indeed a most embarrassing problem to

solve.  It was engaged in a war of conquest which must be

carried to a successful issue, or the political object would be

unattained.  Yet all the capable officers of the requisite rank

belonged to the opposition, and the man selected for his lack of

political ambition had himself become a prominent candidate for

the Presidency.  It was necessary to destroy his chances

promptly.  The problem was to do this without the loss of

conquest and without permitting another general of the same

political party to acquire like popularity.  The fact is, the

administration of Mr. Polk made every preparation to disgrace

Scott, or, to speak more correctly, to drive him to such

desperation that he would disgrace himself.



General Scott had opposed conquest by the way of the Rio Grande,

Matamoras and Saltillo from the first.  Now that he was in

command of all the forces in Mexico, he withdrew from Taylor

most of his regular troops and left him only enough volunteers,

as he thought, to hold the line then in possession of the

invading army.  Indeed Scott did not deem it important to hold

anything beyond the Rio Grande, and authorized Taylor to fall

back to that line if he chose.  General Taylor protested against

the depletion of his army, and his subsequent movement upon Buena

Vista would indicate that he did not share the views of his chief

in regard to the unimportance of conquest beyond the Rio Grande.



Scott had estimated the men and material that would be required

to capture Vera Cruz and to march on the capital of the country,

two hundred and sixty miles in the interior.  He was promised all

he asked and seemed to have not only the confidence of the

President, but his sincere good wishes.  The promises were all

broken.  Only about half the troops were furnished that had been

pledged, other war material was withheld and Scott had scarcely

started for Mexico before the President undertook to supersede

him by the appointment of Senator Thomas H. Benton as

lieutenant-general.  This being refused by Congress, the

President asked legislative authority to place a junior over a

senior of the same grade, with the view of appointing Benton to

the rank of major-general and then placing him in command of the

army, but Congress failed to accede to this proposition as well,

and Scott remained in command:  but every general appointed to

serve under him was politically opposed to the chief, and

several were personally hostile.



General Scott reached Brazos Santiago or Point Isabel, at the

mouth of the Rio Grande, late in December, 1846, and proceeded

at once up the river to Camargo, where he had written General

Taylor to meet him.  Taylor, however, had gone to, or towards

Tampico, for the purpose of establishing a post there.  He had

started on this march before he was aware of General Scott being

in the country.  Under these circumstances Scott had to issue his

orders designating the troops to be withdrawn from Taylor,

without the personal consultation he had expected to hold with

his subordinate.



General Taylor's victory at Buena Vista, February 22d, 23d, and

24th, 1847, with an army composed almost entirely of volunteers

who had not been in battle before, and over a vastly superior

force numerically, made his nomination for the Presidency by the

Whigs a foregone conclusion.  He was nominated and elected in

1848.  I believe that he sincerely regretted this turn in his

fortunes, preferring the peace afforded by a quiet life free

from abuse to the honor of filling the highest office in the

gift of any people, the Presidency of the United States.



When General Scott assumed command of the army of invasion, I

was in the division of General David Twiggs, in Taylor's

command; but under the new orders my regiment was transferred to

the division of General William Worth, in which I served to the

close of the war.  The troops withdrawn from Taylor to form part

of the forces to operate against Vera Cruz, were assembled at the

mouth of the Rio Grande preparatory to embarkation for their

destination.  I found General Worth a different man from any I

had before served directly under.  He was nervous, impatient and

restless on the march, or when important or responsible duty

confronted him.  There was not the least reason for haste on the

march, for it was known that it would take weeks to assemble

shipping enough at the point of our embarkation to carry the

army, but General Worth moved his division with a rapidity that

would have been commendable had he been going to the relief of a

beleaguered garrison.  The length of the marches was regulated by

the distances between places affording a supply of water for the

troops, and these distances were sometimes long and sometimes

short.  General Worth on one occasion at least, after having

made the full distance intended for the day, and after the

troops were in camp and preparing their food, ordered tents

struck and made the march that night which had been intended for

the next day.  Some commanders can move troops so as to get the

maximum distance out of them without fatigue, while others can

wear them out in a few days without accomplishing so much.

General Worth belonged to this latter class.  He enjoyed,

however, a fine reputation for his fighting qualities, and thus

attached his officers and men to him.



The army lay in camp upon the sand-beach in the neighborhood of

the mouth of the Rio Grande for several weeks, awaiting the

arrival of transports to carry it to its new field of

operations.  The transports were all sailing vessels.  The

passage was a tedious one, and many of the troops were on

shipboard over thirty days from the embarkation at the mouth of

the Rio Grande to the time of debarkation south of Vera Cruz.

The trip was a comfortless one for officers and men.  The

transports used were built for carrying freight and possessed

but limited accommodations for passengers, and the climate added

to the discomfort of all.



The transports with troops were assembled in the harbor of Anton

Lizardo, some sixteen miles south of Vera Cruz, as they arrived,

and there awaited the remainder of the fleet, bringing

artillery, ammunition and supplies of all kinds from the

North.  With the fleet there was a little steam propeller

dispatch-boat--the first vessel of the kind I had ever seen, and

probably the first of its kind ever seen by any one then with the

army.  At that day ocean steamers were rare, and what there were

were sidewheelers.  This little vessel, going through the fleet

so fast, so noiselessly and with its propeller under water out

of view, attracted a great deal of attention.  I recollect that

Lieutenant Sidney Smith, of the 4th infantry, by whom I happened

to be standing on the deck of a vessel when this propeller was

passing, exclaimed, "Why, the thing looks as if it was propelled

by the force of circumstances."



Finally on the 7th of March, 1847, the little army of ten or

twelve thousand men, given Scott to invade a country with a

population of seven or eight millions, a mountainous country

affording the greatest possible natural advantages for defence,

was all assembled and ready to commence the perilous task of

landing from vessels lying in the open sea.



The debarkation took place inside of the little island of

Sacrificios, some three miles south of Vera Cruz.  The vessels

could not get anywhere near shore, so that everything had to be

landed in lighters or surf-boats; General Scott had provided

these before leaving the North.  The breakers were sometimes

high, so that the landing was tedious.  The men were got ashore

rapidly, because they could wade when they came to shallow

water; but the camp and garrison equipage, provisions,

ammunition and all stores had to be protected from the salt

water, and therefore their landing took several days.  The

Mexicans were very kind to us, however, and threw no obstacles

in the way of our landing except an occasional shot from their

nearest fort.  During the debarkation one shot took off the head

of Major Albertis.  No other, I believe, reached anywhere near

the same distance.  On the 9th of March the troops were landed

and the investment of Vera Cruz, from the Gulf of Mexico south

of the city to the Gulf again on the north, was soon and easily

effected.  The landing of stores was continued until everything

was got ashore.



Vera Cruz, at the time of which I write and up to 1880, was a

walled city.  The wall extended from the water's edge south of

the town to the water again on the north.  There were

fortifications at intervals along the line and at the angles. In

front of the city, and on an island half a mile out in the Gulf,

stands San Juan de Ulloa, an enclosed fortification of large

dimensions and great strength for that period.  Against

artillery of the present day the land forts and walls would

prove elements of weakness rather than strength.  After the

invading army had established their camps out of range of the

fire from the city, batteries were established, under cover of

night, far to the front of the line where the troops lay.  These

batteries were intrenched and the approaches sufficiently

protected.  If a sortie had been made at any time by the

Mexicans, the men serving the batteries could have been quickly

reinforced without great exposure to the fire from the enemy's

main line.  No serious attempt was made to capture the batteries

or to drive our troops away.



The siege continued with brisk firing on our side till the 27th

of March, by which time a considerable breach had been made in

the wall surrounding the city.  Upon this General Morales, who

was Governor of both the city and of San Juan de Ulloa,

commenced a correspondence with General Scott looking to the

surrender of the town, forts and garrison.  On the 29th Vera

Cruz and San Juan de Ulloa were occupied by Scott's army.  About

five thousand prisoners and four hundred pieces of artillery,

besides large amounts of small arms and ammunition, fell into

the hands of the victorious force.  The casualties on our side

during the siege amounted to sixty-four officers and men, killed

and wounded.
