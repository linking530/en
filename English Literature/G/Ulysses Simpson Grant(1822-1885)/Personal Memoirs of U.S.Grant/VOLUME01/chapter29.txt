VAN DORN'S MOVEMENTS--BATTLE OF CORINTH--COMMAND OF THE

DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE.



On the 19th of September General Geo. H. Thomas was ordered east

to reinforce Buell.  This threw the army at my command still more

on the defensive.  The Memphis and Charleston railroad was

abandoned, except at Corinth, and small forces were left at

Chewalla and Grand Junction.  Soon afterwards the latter of

these two places was given up and Bolivar became our most

advanced position on the Mississippi Central railroad.  Our

cavalry was kept well to the front and frequent expeditions were

sent out to watch the movements of the enemy.  We were in a

country where nearly all the people, except the negroes, were

hostile to us and friendly to the cause we were trying to

suppress.  It was easy, therefore, for the enemy to get early

information of our every move.  We, on the contrary, had to go

after our information in force, and then often returned without

it.



On the 22d Bolivar was threatened by a large force from south of

Grand Junction, supposed to be twenty regiments of infantry with

cavalry and artillery.  I reinforced Bolivar, and went to

Jackson in person to superintend the movement of troops to

whatever point the attack might be made upon.  The troops from

Corinth were brought up in time to repel the threatened movement

without a battle.  Our cavalry followed the enemy south of Davis'

mills in Mississippi.



On the 30th I found that Van Dorn was apparently endeavoring to

strike the Mississippi River above Memphis.  At the same time

other points within my command were so threatened that it was

impossible to concentrate a force to drive him away.  There was

at this juncture a large Union force at Helena, Arkansas, which,

had it been within my command, I could have ordered across the

river to attack and break up the Mississippi Central railroad

far to the south.  This would not only have called Van Dorn

back, but would have compelled the retention of a large rebel

force far to the south to prevent a repetition of such raids on

the enemy's line of supplies.  Geographical lines between the

commands during the rebellion were not always well chosen, or

they were too rigidly adhered to.



Van Dorn did not attempt to get upon the line above Memphis, as

had apparently been his intention.  He was simply covering a

deeper design; one much more important to his cause.  By the 1st

of October it was fully apparent that Corinth was to be attacked

with great force and determination, and that Van Dorn, Lovell,

Price, Villepigue and Rust had joined their strength for this

purpose.  There was some skirmishing outside of Corinth with the

advance of the enemy on the 3d.  The rebels massed in the

north-west angle of the Memphis and Charleston and the Mobile

and Ohio railroads, and were thus between the troops at Corinth

and all possible reinforcements.  Any fresh troops for us must

come by a circuitous route.



On the night of the 3d, accordingly, I ordered General

McPherson, who was at Jackson, to join Rosecrans at Corinth with

reinforcements picked up along the line of the railroad equal to

a brigade.  Hurlbut had been ordered from Bolivar to march for

the same destination; and as Van Dorn was coming upon Corinth

from the north-west some of his men fell in with the advance of

Hurlbut's and some skirmishing ensued on the evening of the

3d.  On the 4th Van Dorn made a dashing attack, hoping, no

doubt, to capture Rosecrans before his reinforcements could come

up.  In that case the enemy himself could have occupied the

defences of Corinth and held at bay all the Union troops that

arrived.  In fact he could have taken the offensive against the

reinforcements with three or four times their number and still

left a sufficient garrison in the works about Corinth to hold

them.  He came near success, some of his troops penetrating the

National lines at least once, but the works that were built

after Halleck's departure enabled Rosecrans to hold his position

until the troops of both McPherson and Hurlbut approached towards

the rebel front and rear.  The enemy was finally driven back with

great slaughter:  all their charges, made with great gallantry,

were repulsed.  The loss on our side was heavy, but nothing to

compare with Van Dorn's.  McPherson came up with the train of

cars bearing his command as close to the enemy as was prudent,

debarked on the rebel flank and got in to the support of

Rosecrans just after the repulse.  His approach, as well as that

of Hurlbut, was known to the enemy and had a moral effect.

General Rosecrans, however, failed to follow up the victory,

although I had given specific orders in advance of the battle

for him to pursue the moment the enemy was repelled.  He did not

do so, and I repeated the order after the battle.  In the first

order he was notified that the force of 4,000 men which was

going to his assistance would be in great peril if the enemy was

not pursued.



General Ord had joined Hurlbut on the 4th and being senior took

command of his troops.  This force encountered the head of Van

Dorn's retreating column just as it was crossing the Hatchie by

a bridge some ten miles out from Corinth.  The bottom land here

was swampy and bad for the operations of troops, making a good

place to get an enemy into.  Ord attacked the troops that had

crossed the bridge and drove them back in a panic.  Many were

killed, and others were drowned by being pushed off the bridge

in their hurried retreat.  Ord followed and met the main

force.  He was too weak in numbers to assault, but he held the

bridge and compelled the enemy to resume his retreat by another

bridge higher up the stream.  Ord was wounded in this engagement

and the command devolved on Hurlbut.



Rosecrans did not start in pursuit till the morning of the 5th

and then took the wrong road.  Moving in the enemy's country he

travelled with a wagon train to carry his provisions and

munitions of war.  His march was therefore slower than that of

the enemy, who was moving towards his supplies.  Two or three

hours of pursuit on the day of battle, without anything except

what the men carried on their persons, would have been worth

more than any pursuit commenced the next day could have possibly

been.  Even when he did start, if Rosecrans had followed the

route taken by the enemy, he would have come upon Van Dorn in a

swamp with a stream in front and Ord holding the only bridge;

but he took the road leading north and towards Chewalla instead

of west, and, after having marched as far as the enemy had moved

to get to the Hatchie, he was as far from battle as when he

started.  Hurlbut had not the numbers to meet any such force as

Van Dorn's if they had been in any mood for fighting, and he

might have been in great peril.



I now regarded the time to accomplish anything by pursuit as

past and, after Rosecrans reached Jonesboro, I ordered him to

return.  He kept on to Ripley, however, and was persistent in

wanting to go farther.  I thereupon ordered him to halt and

submitted the matter to the general-in-chief, who allowed me to

exercise my judgment in the matter, but inquired "why not

pursue?"  Upon this I ordered Rosecrans back.  Had he gone much

farther he would have met a greater force than Van Dorn had at

Corinth and behind intrenchments or on chosen ground, and the

probabilities are he would have lost his army.



The battle of Corinth was bloody, our loss being 315 killed,

1,812 wounded and 232 missing.  The enemy lost many more.

Rosecrans reported 1,423 dead and 2,225 prisoners.  We fought

behind breastworks, which accounts in some degree for the

disparity.  Among the killed on our side was General

Hackelman.  General Oglesby was badly, it was for some time

supposed mortally, wounded.  I received a congratulatory letter

from the President, which expressed also his sorrow for the

losses.



This battle was recognized by me as being a decided victory,

though not so complete as I had hoped for, nor nearly so

complete as I now think was within the easy grasp of the

commanding officer at Corinth.  Since the war it is known that

the result, as it was, was a crushing blow to the enemy, and

felt by him much more than it was appreciated at the North.  The

battle relieved me from any further anxiety for the safety of the

territory within my jurisdiction, and soon after receiving

reinforcements I suggested to the general-in-chief a forward

movement against Vicksburg.



On the 23d of October I learned of Pemberton's being in command

at Holly Springs and much reinforced by conscripts and troops

from Alabama and Texas.  The same day General Rosecrans was

relieved from duty with my command, and shortly after he

succeeded Buell in the command of the army in Middle

Tennessee.  I was delighted at the promotion of General

Rosecrans to a separate command, because I still believed that

when independent of an immediate superior the qualities which I,

at that time, credited him with possessing, would show

themselves.  As a subordinate I found that I could not make him

do as I wished, and had determined to relieve him from duty that

very day.



At the close of the operations just described my force, in round

numbers, was 48,500.  Of these 4,800 were in Kentucky and

Illinois, 7,000 in Memphis, 19,200 from Mound City south, and

17,500 at Corinth.  General McClernand had been authorized from

Washington to go north and organize troops to be used in opening

the Mississippi.  These new levies with other reinforcements now

began to come in.



On the 25th of October I was placed in command of the Department

of the Tennessee.  Reinforcements continued to come from the

north and by the 2d of November I was prepared to take the

initiative.  This was a great relief after the two and a half

months of continued defence over a large district of country,

and where nearly every citizen was an enemy ready to give

information of our every move.  I have described very

imperfectly a few of the battles and skirmishes that took place

during this time.  To describe all would take more space than I

can allot to the purpose; to make special mention of all the

officers and troops who distinguished themselves, would take a

volume. (*9)
