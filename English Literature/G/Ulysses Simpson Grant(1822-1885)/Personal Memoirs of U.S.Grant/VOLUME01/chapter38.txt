On the 22d of June positive information was received that

Johnston had crossed the Big Black River for the purpose of

attacking our rear, to raise the siege and release Pemberton.

The correspondence between Johnston and Pemberton shows that all

expectation of holding Vicksburg had by this time passed from

Johnston's mind.  I immediately ordered Sherman to the command

of all the forces from Haines' Bluff to the Big Black River.

This amounted now to quite half the troops about Vicksburg.

Besides these, Herron and A. J. Smith's divisions were ordered

to hold themselves in readiness to reinforce Sherman.  Haines'

Bluff had been strongly fortified on the land side, and on all

commanding points from there to the Big Black at the railroad

crossing batteries had been constructed.  The work of connecting

by rifle-pits where this was not already done, was an easy task

for the troops that were to defend them.



We were now looking west, besieging Pemberton, while we were

also looking east to defend ourselves against an expected siege

by Johnston.  But as against the garrison of Vicksburg we were

as substantially protected as they were against us.  Where we

were looking east and north we were strongly fortified, and on

the defensive.  Johnston evidently took in the situation and

wisely, I think, abstained from making an assault on us because

it would simply have inflicted loss on both sides without

accomplishing any result.  We were strong enough to have taken

the offensive against him; but I did not feel disposed to take

any risk of losing our hold upon Pemberton's army, while I would

have rejoiced at the opportunity of defending ourselves against

an attack by Johnston.



From the 23d of May the work of fortifying and pushing forward

our position nearer to the enemy had been steadily

progressing.  At three points on the Jackson road, in front of

Leggett's brigade, a sap was run up to the enemy's parapet, and

by the 25th of June we had it undermined and the mine charged.

The enemy had countermined, but did not succeed in reaching our

mine.  At this particular point the hill on which the rebel work

stands rises abruptly.  Our sap ran close up to the outside of

the enemy's parapet.  In fact this parapet was also our

protection.  The soldiers of the two sides occasionally

conversed pleasantly across this barrier; sometimes they

exchanged the hard bread of the Union soldiers for the tobacco

of the Confederates; at other times the enemy threw over

hand-grenades, and often our men, catching them in their hands,

returned them.



Our mine had been started some distance back down the hill;

consequently when it had extended as far as the parapet it was

many feet below it.  This caused the failure of the enemy in his

search to find and destroy it.  On the 25th of June at three

o'clock, all being ready, the mine was exploded.  A heavy

artillery fire all along the line had been ordered to open with

the explosion.  The effect was to blow the top of the hill off

and make a crater where it stood.  The breach was not sufficient

to enable us to pass a column of attack through.  In fact, the

enemy having failed to reach our mine had thrown up a line

farther back, where most of the men guarding that point were

placed.  There were a few men, however, left at the advance

line, and others working in the countermine, which was still

being pushed to find ours.  All that were there were thrown into

the air, some of them coming down on our side, still alive.  I

remember one colored man, who had been under ground at work when

the explosion took place, who was thrown to our side.  He was not

much hurt, but terribly frightened.  Some one asked him how high

he had gone up.  "Dun no, massa, but t'ink 'bout t'ree mile,"

was his reply.  General Logan commanded at this point and took

this colored man to his quarters, where he did service to the

end of the siege.



As soon as the explosion took place the crater was seized by two

regiments of our troops who were near by, under cover, where they

had been placed for the express purpose.  The enemy made a

desperate effort to expel them, but failed, and soon retired

behind the new line.  From here, however, they threw

hand-grenades, which did some execution.  The compliment was

returned by our men, but not with so much effect.  The enemy

could lay their grenades on the parapet, which alone divided the

contestants, and roll them down upon us; while from our side they

had to be thrown over the parapet, which was at considerable

elevation.  During the night we made efforts to secure our

position in the crater against the missiles of the enemy, so as

to run trenches along the outer base of their parapet, right and

left; but the enemy continued throwing their grenades, and

brought boxes of field ammunition (shells), the fuses of which

they would light with portfires, and throw them by hand into our

ranks.  We found it impossible to continue this work.  Another

mine was consequently started which was exploded on the 1st of

July, destroying an entire rebel redan, killing and wounding a

considerable number of its occupants and leaving an immense

chasm where it stood.  No attempt to charge was made this time,

the experience of the 25th admonishing us.  Our loss in the

first affair was about thirty killed and wounded.  The enemy

must have lost more in the two explosions than we did in the

first.  We lost none in the second.



From this time forward the work of mining and pushing our

position nearer to the enemy was prosecuted with vigor, and I

determined to explode no more mines until we were ready to

explode a number at different points and assault immediately

after.  We were up now at three different points, one in front

of each corps, to where only the parapet of the enemy divided us.



At this time an intercepted dispatch from Johnston to Pemberton

informed me that Johnston intended to make a determined attack

upon us in order to relieve the garrison at Vicksburg.  I knew

the garrison would make no formidable effort to relieve

itself.  The picket lines were so close to each other--where

there was space enough between the lines to post pickets--that

the men could converse.  On the 21st of June I was informed,

through this means, that Pemberton was preparing to escape, by

crossing to the Louisiana side under cover of night; that he had

employed workmen in making boats for that purpose; that the men

had been canvassed to ascertain if they would make an assault on

the "Yankees" to cut their way out; that they had refused, and

almost mutinied, because their commander would not surrender and

relieve their sufferings, and had only been pacified by the

assurance that boats enough would be finished in a week to carry

them all over.  The rebel pickets also said that houses in the

city had been pulled down to get material to build these boats

with.  Afterwards this story was verified:  on entering the city

we found a large number of very rudely constructed boats.



All necessary steps were at once taken to render such an attempt

abortive.  Our pickets were doubled; Admiral Porter was notified,

so that the river might be more closely watched; material was

collected on the west bank of the river to be set on fire and

light up the river if the attempt was made; and batteries were

established along the levee crossing the peninsula on the

Louisiana side.  Had the attempt been made the garrison of

Vicksburg would have been drowned, or made prisoners on the

Louisiana side.  General Richard Taylor was expected on the west

bank to co-operate in this movement, I believe, but he did not

come, nor could he have done so with a force sufficient to be of

service.  The Mississippi was now in our possession from its

source to its mouth, except in the immediate front of Vicksburg

and of Port Hudson.  We had nearly exhausted the country, along

a line drawn from Lake Providence to opposite Bruinsburg.  The

roads west were not of a character to draw supplies over for any

considerable force.



By the 1st of July our approaches had reached the enemy's ditch

at a number of places.  At ten points we could move under cover

to within from five to one hundred yards of the enemy.  Orders

were given to make all preparations for assault on the 6th of

July.  The debouches were ordered widened to afford easy egress,

while the approaches were also to be widened to admit the troops

to pass through four abreast.  Plank, and bags filled with

cotton packed in tightly, were ordered prepared, to enable the

troops to cross the ditches.



On the night of the 1st of July Johnston was between Brownsville

and the Big Black, and wrote Pemberton from there that about the

7th of the month an attempt would be made to create a diversion

to enable him to cut his way out.  Pemberton was a prisoner

before this message reached him.



On July 1st Pemberton, seeing no hope of outside relief,

addressed the following letter to each of his four division

commanders:



"Unless the siege of Vicksburg is raised, or supplies are thrown

in, it will become necessary very shortly to evacuate the

place.  I see no prospect of the former, and there are many

great, if not insuperable obstacles in the way of the latter.

You are, therefore, requested to inform me with as little delay

as possible, as to the condition of your troops and their

ability to make the marches and undergo the fatigues necessary

to accomplish a successful evacuation."



Two of his generals suggested surrender, and the other two

practically did the same.  They expressed the opinion that an

attempt to evacuate would fail.  Pemberton had previously got a

message to Johnston suggesting that he should try to negotiate

with me for a release of the garrison with their arms.  Johnston

replied that it would be a confession of weakness for him to do

so; but he authorized Pemberton to use his name in making such

an arrangement.



On the 3d about ten o'clock A.M. white flags appeared on a

portion of the rebel works.  Hostilities along that part of the

line ceased at once.  Soon two persons were seen coming towards

our lines bearing a white flag.  They proved to be General

Bowen, a division commander, and Colonel Montgomery,

aide-de-camp to Pemberton, bearing the following letter to me:



"I have the honor to propose an armistice for--hours, with the

view to arranging terms for the capitulation of Vicksburg.  To

this end, if agreeable to you, I will appoint three

commissioners, to meet a like number to be named by yourself at

such place and hour to-day as you may find convenient.  I make

this proposition to save the further effusion of blood, which

must otherwise be shed to a frightful extent, feeling myself

fully able to maintain my position for a yet indefinite

period.  This communication will be handed you under a flag of

truce, by Major-General John S. Bowen."



It was a glorious sight to officers and soldiers on the line

where these white flags were visible, and the news soon spread

to all parts of the command.  The troops felt that their long

and weary marches, hard fighting, ceaseless watching by night

and day, in a hot climate, exposure to all sorts of weather, to

diseases and, worst of all, to the gibes of many Northern papers

that came to them saying all their suffering was in vain, that

Vicksburg would never be taken, were at last at an end and the

Union sure to be saved.



Bowen was received by General A. J. Smith, and asked to see

me.  I had been a neighbor of Bowen's in Missouri, and knew him

well and favorably before the war; but his request was

refused.  He then suggested that I should meet Pemberton.  To

this I sent a verbal message saying that, if Pemberton desired

it, I would meet him in front of McPherson's corps at three

o'clock that afternoon.  I also sent the following written reply

to Pemberton's letter:



"Your note of this date is just received, proposing an armistice

for several hours, for the purpose of arranging terms of

capitulation through commissioners, to be appointed, etc.  The

useless effusion of blood you propose stopping by this course

can be ended at any time you may choose, by the unconditional

surrender of the city and garrison.  Men who have shown so much

endurance and courage as those now in Vicksburg, will always

challenge the respect of an adversary, and I can assure you will

be treated with all the respect due to prisoners of war.  I do

not favor the proposition of appointing commissioners to arrange

the terms of capitulation, because I have no terms other than

those indicated above."



At three o'clock Pemberton appeared at the point suggested in my

verbal message, accompanied by the same officers who had borne

his letter of the morning.  Generals Ord, McPherson, Logan and

A. J. Smith, and several officers of my staff, accompanied me.

Our place of meeting was on a hillside within a few hundred feet

of the rebel lines.  Near by stood a stunted oak-tree, which was

made historical by the event.  It was but a short time before

the last vestige of its body, root and limb had disappeared, the

fragments taken as trophies.  Since then the same tree has

furnished as many cords of wood, in the shape of trophies, as

"The True Cross."



Pemberton and I had served in the same division during part of

the Mexican War.  I knew him very well therefore, and greeted

him as an old acquaintance.  He soon asked what terms I proposed

to give his army if it surrendered.  My answer was the same as

proposed in my reply to his letter.  Pemberton then said, rather

snappishly, "The conference might as well end," and turned

abruptly as if to leave.  I said, "Very well."  General Bowen, I

saw, was very anxious that the surrender should be consummated. 

His manner and remarks while Pemberton and I were talking,

showed this.  He now proposed that he and one of our generals

should have a conference.  I had no objection to this, as

nothing could be made binding upon me that they might propose. 

Smith and Bowen accordingly had a conference, during which

Pemberton and I, moving a short distance away towards the

enemy's lines were in conversation.  After a while Bowen

suggested that the Confederate army should be allowed to march

out with the honors of war, carrying their small arms and field

artillery.  This was promptly and unceremoniously rejected.  The

interview here ended, I agreeing, however, to send a letter

giving final terms by ten o'clock that night.



Word was sent to Admiral Porter soon after the correspondence

with Pemberton commenced, so that hostilities might be stopped

on the part of both army and navy.  It was agreed on my paging

with Pemberton that they should not be renewed until our

correspondence ceased.



When I returned to my headquarters I sent for all the corps and

division commanders with the army immediately confronting

Vicksburg.  Half the army was from eight to twelve miles off,

waiting for Johnston.  I informed them of the contents of

Pemberton's letters, of my reply and the substance of the

interview, and that I was ready to hear any suggestion; but

would hold the power of deciding entirely in my own hands.  This

was the nearest approach to a "council of war" I ever held.

Against the general, and almost unanimous judgment of the

council I sent the following letter:



"In conformity with agreement of this afternoon, I will submit

the following proposition for the surrender of the City of

Vicksburg, public stores, etc.  On your accepting the terms

proposed, I will march in one division as a guard, and take

possession at eight A.M. to-morrow.  As soon as rolls can be

made out, and paroles be signed by officers and men, you will be

allowed to march out of our lines, the officers taking with them

their side-arms and clothing, and the field, staff and cavalry

officers one horse each.  The rank and file will be allowed all

their clothing, but no other property.  If these conditions are

accepted, any amount of rations you may deem necessary can be

taken from the stores you now have, and also the necessary

cooking utensils for preparing them.  Thirty wagons also,

counting two two-horse or mule teams as one, will be allowed to

transport such articles as cannot be carried along.  The same

conditions will be allowed to all sick and wounded officers and

soldiers as fast as they become able to travel.  The paroles for

these latter must be signed, however, whilst officers present are

authorized to sign the roll of prisoners."



By the terms of the cartel then in force, prisoners captured by

either army were required to be forwarded as soon as possible to

either Aiken's landing below Dutch Gap on the James River, or to

Vicksburg, there to be exchanged, or paroled until they could be

exchanged.  There was a Confederate commissioner at Vicksburg,

authorized to make the exchange.  I did not propose to take him

a prisoner, but to leave him free to perform the functions of

his office.  Had I insisted upon an unconditional surrender

there would have been over thirty thousand men to transport to

Cairo, very much to the inconvenience of the army on the

Mississippi.  Thence the prisoners would have had to be

transported by rail to Washington or Baltimore; thence again by

steamer to Aiken's--all at very great expense.  At Aiken's they

would have had to be paroled, because the Confederates did not

have Union prisoners to give in exchange.  Then again

Pemberton's army was largely composed of men whose homes were in

the South-west; I knew many of them were tired of the war and

would get home just as soon as they could.  A large number of

them had voluntarily come into our lines during the siege, and

requested to be sent north where they could get employment until

the war was over and they could go to their homes.



Late at night I received the following reply to my last letter:



"I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your

communication of this date, proposing terms of capitulation for

this garrison and post.  In the main your terms are accepted;

but, in justice both to the honor and spirit of my troops

manifested in the defence of Vicksburg, I have to submit the

following amendments, which, if acceded to by you, will perfect

the agreement between us.  At ten o'clock A.M. to-morrow, I

propose to evacuate the works in and around Vicksburg, and to

surrender the city and garrison under my command, by marching

out with my colors and arms, stacking them in front of my

present lines.  After which you will take possession.  Officers

to retain their side-arms and personal property, and the rights

and property of citizens to be respected."



This was received after midnight.  My reply was as follows:



"I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your

communication of 3d July.  The amendment proposed by you cannot

be acceded to in full.  It will be necessary to furnish every

officer and man with a parole signed by himself, which, with the

completion of the roll of prisoners, will necessarily take some

time.  Again, I can make no stipulations with regard to the

treatment of citizens and their private property.  While I do

not propose to cause them any undue annoyance or loss, I cannot

consent to leave myself under any restraint by stipulations. The

property which officers will be allowed to take with them will be

as stated in my proposition of last evening; that is, officers

will be allowed their private baggage and side-arms, and mounted

officers one horse each.  If you mean by your proposition for

each brigade to march to the front of the lines now occupied by

it, and stack arms at ten o'clock A.M., and then return to the

inside and there remain as prisoners until properly paroled, I

will make no objection to it.  Should no notification be

received of your acceptance of my terms by nine o'clock A.M. I

shall regard them as having been rejected, and shall act

accordingly.  Should these terms be accepted, white flags should

be displayed along your lines to prevent such of my troops as may

not have been notified, from firing upon your men."



Pemberton promptly accepted these terms.



During the siege there had been a good deal of friendly sparring

between the soldiers of the two armies, on picket and where the

lines were close together.  All rebels were known as "Johnnies,"

all Union troops as "Yanks."  Often "Johnny" would call:  "Well,

Yank, when are you coming into town?"  The reply was sometimes:

"We propose to celebrate the 4th of July there."  Sometimes it

would be:  "We always treat our prisoners with kindness and do

not want to hurt them;" or, "We are holding you as prisoners of

war while you are feeding yourselves."  The garrison, from the

commanding general down, undoubtedly expected an assault on the

fourth.  They knew from the temper of their men it would be

successful when made; and that would be a greater humiliation

than to surrender.  Besides it would be attended with severe

loss to them.



The Vicksburg paper, which we received regularly through the

courtesy of the rebel pickets, said prior to the fourth, in

speaking of the "Yankee" boast that they would take dinner in

Vicksburg that day, that the best receipt for cooking a rabbit

was "First ketch your rabbit."  The paper at this time and for

some time previous was printed on the plain side of wall

paper.  The last number was issued on the fourth and announced

that we had "caught our rabbit."



I have no doubt that Pemberton commenced his correspondence on

the third with a two-fold purpose:  first, to avoid an assault,

which he knew would be successful, and second, to prevent the

capture taking place on the great national holiday, the

anniversary of the Declaration of American Independence. Holding

out for better terms as he did he defeated his aim in the latter

particular.



At the appointed hour the garrison of Vicksburg marched out of

their works and formed line in front, stacked arms and marched

back in good order.  Our whole army present witnessed this scene

without cheering.  Logan's division, which had approached nearest

the rebel works, was the first to march in; and the flag of one

of the regiments of his division was soon floating over the

court-house.  Our soldiers were no sooner inside the lines than

the two armies began to fraternize.  Our men had had full

rations from the time the siege commenced, to the close.  The

enemy had been suffering, particularly towards the last.  I

myself saw our men taking bread from their haversacks and giving

it to the enemy they had so recently been engaged in starving

out.  It was accepted with avidity and with thanks.



Pemberton says in his report:



"If it should be asked why the 4th of July was selected as the

day for surrender, the answer is obvious.  I believed that upon

that day I should obtain better terms.  Well aware of the vanity

of our foe, I knew they would attach vast importance to the

entrance on the 4th of July into the stronghold of the great

river, and that, to gratify their national vanity, they would

yield then what could not be extorted from them at any other

time."



This does not support my view of his reasons for selecting the

day he did for surrendering.  But it must be recollected that

his first letter asking terms was received about 10 o'clock

A.M., July 3d.  It then could hardly be expected that it would

take twenty-four hours to effect a surrender.  He knew that

Johnston was in our rear for the purpose of raising the siege,

and he naturally would want to hold out as long as he could.  He

knew his men would not resist an assault, and one was expected on

the fourth.  In our interview he told me he had rations enough to

hold out for some time--my recollection is two weeks.  It was

this statement that induced me to insert in the terms that he

was to draw rations for his men from his own supplies.



On the 4th of July General Holmes, with an army of eight or nine

thousand men belonging to the trans-Mississippi department, made

an attack upon Helena, Arkansas.  He was totally defeated by

General Prentiss, who was holding Helena with less than

forty-two hundred soldiers.  Holmes reported his loss at 1,636,

of which 173 were killed; but as Prentiss buried 400, Holmes

evidently understated his losses.  The Union loss was 57 killed,

127 wounded, and between 30 and 40 missing.  This was the last

effort on the part of the Confederacy to raise the siege of

Vicksburg.



On the third, as soon as negotiations were commenced, I notified

Sherman and directed him to be ready to take the offensive

against Johnston, drive him out of the State and destroy his

army if he could.  Steele and Ord were directed at the same time

to be in readiness to join Sherman as soon as the surrender took

place.  Of this Sherman was notified.



I rode into Vicksburg with the troops, and went to the river to

exchange congratulations with the navy upon our joint victory.

At that time I found that many of the citizens had been living

under ground.  The ridges upon which Vicksburg is built, and

those back to the Big Black, are composed of a deep yellow clay

of great tenacity.  Where roads and streets are cut through,

perpendicular banks are left and stand as well as if composed of

stone.  The magazines of the enemy were made by running

passage-ways into this clay at places where there were deep

cuts.  Many citizens secured places of safety for their families

by carving out rooms in these embankments.  A door-way in these

cases would be cut in a high bank, starting from the level of

the road or street, and after running in a few feet a room of

the size required was carved out of the clay, the dirt being

removed by the door-way.  In some instances I saw where two

rooms were cut out, for a single family, with a door-way in the

clay wall separating them.  Some of these were carpeted and

furnished with considerable elaboration.  In these the occupants

were fully secure from the shells of the navy, which were dropped

into the city night and dav without intermission.



I returned to my old headquarters outside in the afternoon, and

did not move into the town until the sixth.  On the afternoon of

the fourth I sent Captain Wm. M. Dunn of my staff to Cairo, the

nearest point where the telegraph could be reached, with a

dispatch to the general-in-chief.  It was as follows:



"The enemy surrendered this morning.  The only terms allowed is

their parole as prisoners of war.  This I regard as a great

advantage to us at this moment.  It saves, probably, several

days in the capture, and leaves troops and transports ready for

immediate service.  Sherman, with a large force, moves

immediately on Johnston, to drive him from the State.  I will

send troops to the relief of Banks, and return the 9th army

corps to Burnside."



This news, with the victory at Gettysburg won the same day,

lifted a great load of anxiety from the minds of the President,

his Cabinet and the loyal people all over the North.  The fate

of the Confederacy was sealed when Vicksburg fell.  Much hard

fighting was to be done afterwards and many precious lives were

to be sacrificed; but the MORALE was with the supporters of the

Union ever after.



I at the same time wrote to General Banks informing him of the

fall and sending him a copy of the terms; also saying I would

send him all the troops he wanted to insure the capture of the

only foothold the enemy now had on the Mississippi River.

General Banks had a number of copies of this letter printed, or

at least a synopsis of it, and very soon a copy fell into the

hands of General Gardner, who was then in command of Port

Hudson.  Gardner at once sent a letter to the commander of the

National forces saying that he had been informed of the

surrender of Vicksburg and telling how the information reached

him.  He added that if this was true, it was useless for him to

hold out longer.  General Banks gave him assurances that

Vicksburg had been surrendered, and General Gardner surrendered

unconditionally on the 9th of July.  Port Hudson with nearly

6,000 prisoners, 51 guns, 5,000 small-arms and other stores fell

into the hands of the Union forces:  from that day to the close

of the rebellion the Mississippi River, from its source to its

mouth, remained in the control of the National troops.



Pemberton and his army were kept in Vicksburg until the whole

could be paroled.  The paroles were in duplicate, by

organization (one copy for each, Federals and Confederates), and

signed by the commanding officers of the companies or

regiments.  Duplicates were also made for each soldier and

signed by each individually, one to be retained by the soldier

signing and one to be retained by us.  Several hundred refused

to sign their paroles, preferring to be sent to the North as

prisoners to being sent back to fight again.  Others again kept

out of the way, hoping to escape either alternative.



Pemberton appealed to me in person to compel these men to sign

their paroles, but I declined.  It also leaked out that many of

the men who had signed their paroles, intended to desert and go

to their homes as soon as they got out of our lines.  Pemberton

hearing this, again appealed to me to assist him.  He wanted

arms for a battalion, to act as guards in keeping his men

together while being marched to a camp of instruction, where he

expected to keep them until exchanged.  This request was also

declined.  It was precisely what I expected and hoped that they

would do.  I told him, however, that I would see that they

marched beyond our lines in good order.  By the eleventh, just

one week after the surrender, the paroles were completed and the

Confederate garrison marched out.  Many deserted, and fewer of

them were ever returned to the ranks to fight again than would

have been the case had the surrender been unconditional and the

prisoners sent to the James River to be paroled.



As soon as our troops took possession of the city guards were

established along the whole line of parapet, from the river

above to the river below.  The prisoners were allowed to occupy

their old camps behind the intrenchments.  No restraint was put

upon them, except by their own commanders.  They were rationed

about as our own men, and from our supplies.  The men of the two

armies fraternized as if they had been fighting for the same

cause.  When they passed out of the works they had so long and

so gallantly defended, between lines of their late antagonists,

not a cheer went up, not a remark was made that would give

pain.  Really, I believe there was a feeling of sadness just

then in the breasts of most of the Union soldiers at seeing the

dejection of their late antagonists.



The day before the departure the following order was issued:



"Paroled prisoners will be sent out of here to-morrow.  They

will be authorized to cross at the railroad bridge, and move

from there to Edward's Ferry, (*14) and on by way of Raymond.

Instruct the commands to be orderly and quiet as these prisoners

pass, to make no offensive remarks, and not to harbor any who

fall out of ranks after they have passed."
