STRUCK BY A BULLET--PRECIPITATE RETREAT OF THE

CONFEDERATES--INTRENCHMENTS AT SHILOH--GENERAL BUELL--GENERAL

JOHNSTON--REMARKS ON SHILOH.



During this second day of the battle I had been moving from

right to left and back, to see for myself the progress made.  In

the early part of the afternoon, while riding with Colonel

McPherson and Major Hawkins, then my chief commissary, we got

beyond the left of our troops.  We were moving along the

northern edge of a clearing, very leisurely, toward the river

above the landing.  There did not appear to be an enemy to our

right, until suddenly a battery with musketry opened upon us

from the edge of the woods on the other side of the clearing.

The shells and balls whistled about our ears very fast for about

a minute.  I do not think it took us longer than that to get out

of range and out of sight.  In the sudden start we made, Major

Hawkins lost his hat.  He did not stop to pick it up.  When we

arrived at a perfectly safe position we halted to take an

account of damages.  McPherson's horse was panting as if ready

to drop.  On examination it was found that a ball had struck him

forward of the flank just back of the saddle, and had gone

entirely through.  In a few minutes the poor beast dropped dead;

he had given no sign of injury until we came to a stop.  A ball

had struck the metal scabbard of my sword, just below the hilt,

and broken it nearly off; before the battle was over it had

broken off entirely.  There were three of us:  one had lost a

horse, killed; one a hat and one a sword-scabbard.  All were

thankful that it was no worse.



After the rain of the night before and the frequent and heavy

rains for some days previous, the roads were almost

impassable.  The enemy carrying his artillery and supply trains

over them in his retreat, made them still worse for troops

following.  I wanted to pursue, but had not the heart to order

the men who had fought desperately for two days, lying in the

mud and rain whenever not fighting, and I did (*8) not feel

disposed to positively order Buell, or any part of his command,

to pursue.  Although the senior in rank at the time I had been

so only a few weeks.  Buell was, and had been for some time

past, a department commander, while I commanded only a

district.  I did not meet Buell in person until too late to get

troops ready and pursue with effect; but had I seen him at the

moment of the last charge I should have at least requested him

to follow.



I rode forward several miles the day after the battle, and found

that the enemy had dropped much, if not all, of their provisions,

some ammunition and the extra wheels of their caissons,

lightening their loads to enable them to get off their guns.

About five miles out we found their field hospital abandoned. An

immediate pursuit must have resulted in the capture of a

considerable number of prisoners and probably some guns.



Shiloh was the severest battle fought at the West during the

war, and but few in the East equalled it for hard, determined

fighting.  I saw an open field, in our possession on the second

day, over which the Confederates had made repeated charges the

day before, so covered with dead that it would have been

possible to walk across the clearing, in any direction, stepping

on dead bodies, without a foot touching the ground.  On our side

National and Confederate troops were mingled together in about

equal proportions; but on the remainder of the field nearly all

were Confederates.  On one part, which had evidently not been

ploughed for several years, probably because the land was poor,

bushes had grown up, some to the height of eight or ten feet.

There was not one of these left standing unpierced by bullets.

The smaller ones were all cut down.



Contrary to all my experience up to that time, and to the

experience of the army I was then commanding, we were on the

defensive.  We were without intrenchments or defensive

advantages of any sort, and more than half the army engaged the

first day was without experience or even drill as soldiers.  The

officers with them, except the division commanders and possibly

two or three of the brigade commanders, were equally

inexperienced in war.  The result was a Union victory that gave

the men who achieved it great confidence in themselves ever

after.



The enemy fought bravely, but they had started out to defeat and

destroy an army and capture a position.  They failed in both,

with very heavy loss in killed and wounded, and must have gone

back discouraged and convinced that the "Yankee" was not an

enemy to be despised.



After the battle I gave verbal instructions to division

commanders to let the regiments send out parties to bury their

own dead, and to detail parties, under commissioned officers

from each division, to bury the Confederate dead in their

respective fronts and to report the numbers so buried.  The

latter part of these instructions was not carried out by all;

but they were by those sent from Sherman's division, and by some

of the parties sent out by McClernand.  The heaviest loss

sustained by the enemy was in front of these two divisions.



The criticism has often been made that the Union troops should

have been intrenched at Shiloh.  Up to that time the pick and

spade had been but little resorted to at the West.  I had,

however, taken this subject under consideration soon after

re-assuming command in the field, and, as already stated, my

only military engineer reported unfavorably.  Besides this, the

troops with me, officers and men, needed discipline and drill

more than they did experience with the pick, shovel and axe.

Reinforcements were arriving almost daily, composed of troops

that had been hastily thrown together into companies and

regiments--fragments of incomplete organizations, the men and

officers strangers to each other.  Under all these circumstances

I concluded that drill and discipline were worth more to our men

than fortifications.



General Buell was a brave, intelligent officer, with as much

professional pride and ambition of a commendable sort as I ever

knew.  I had been two years at West Point with him, and had

served with him afterwards, in garrison and in the Mexican war,

several years more.  He was not given in early life or in mature

years to forming intimate acquaintances.  He was studious by

habit, and commanded the confidence and respect of all who knew

him.  He was a strict disciplinarian, and perhaps did not

distinguish sufficiently between the volunteer who "enlisted for

the war" and the soldier who serves in time of peace.  One system

embraced men who risked life for a principle, and often men of

social standing, competence, or wealth and independence of

character.  The other includes, as a rule, only men who could

not do as well in any other occupation.  General Buell became an

object of harsh criticism later, some going so far as to

challenge his loyalty.  No one who knew him ever believed him

capable of a dishonorable act, and nothing could be more

dishonorable than to accept high rank and command in war and

then betray the trust.  When I came into command of the army in

1864, I requested the Secretary of War to restore General Buell

to duty.



After the war, during the summer of 1865, I travelled

considerably through the North, and was everywhere met by large

numbers of people.  Every one had his opinion about the manner

in which the war had been conducted:  who among the generals had

failed, how, and why.  Correspondents of the press were ever on

hand to hear every word dropped, and were not always disposed to

report correctly what did not confirm their preconceived notions,

either about the conduct of the war or the individuals concerned

in it.  The opportunity frequently occurred for me to defend

General Buell against what I believed to be most unjust

charges.  On one occasion a correspondent put in my mouth the

very charge I had so often refuted--of disloyalty.  This brought

from General Buell a very severe retort, which I saw in the New

York World some time before I received the letter itself.  I

could very well understand his grievance at seeing untrue and

disgraceful charges apparently sustained by an officer who, at

the time, was at the head of the army.  I replied to him, but

not through the press.  I kept no copy of my letter, nor did I

ever see it in print; neither did I receive an answer.



General Albert Sidney Johnston, who commanded the Confederate

forces at the beginning of the battle, was disabled by a wound

on the afternoon of the first day.  This wound, as I understood

afterwards, was not necessarily fatal, or even dangerous.  But

he was a man who would not abandon what he deemed an important

trust in the face of danger and consequently continued in the

saddle, commanding, until so exhausted by the loss of blood that

he had to be taken from his horse, and soon after died.  The news

was not long in reaching our side and I suppose was quite an

encouragement to the National soldiers.



I had known Johnston slightly in the Mexican war and later as an

officer in the regular army.  He was a man of high character and

ability.  His contemporaries at West Point, and officers

generally who came to know him personally later and who remained

on our side, expected him to prove the most formidable man to

meet that the Confederacy would produce.



I once wrote that nothing occurred in his brief command of an

army to prove or disprove the high estimate that had been placed

upon his military ability; but after studying the orders and

dispatches of Johnston I am compelled to materially modify my

views of that officer's qualifications as a soldier.  My

judgment now is that he was vacillating and undecided in his

actions.



All the disasters in Kentucky and Tennessee were so discouraging

to the authorities in Richmond that Jefferson Davis wrote an

unofficial letter to Johnston expressing his own anxiety and

that of the public, and saying that he had made such defence as

was dictated by long friendship, but that in the absence of a

report he needed facts.  The letter was not a reprimand in

direct terms, but it was evidently as much felt as though it had

been one.  General Johnston raised another army as rapidly as he

could, and fortified or strongly intrenched at Corinth.  He knew

the National troops were preparing to attack him in his chosen

position.  But he had evidently become so disturbed at the

results of his operations that he resolved to strike out in an

offensive campaign which would restore all that was lost, and if

successful accomplish still more.  We have the authority of his

son and biographer for saying that his plan was to attack the

forces at Shiloh and crush them; then to cross the Tennessee and

destroy the army of Buell, and push the war across the Ohio

River.  The design was a bold one; but we have the same

authority for saying that in the execution Johnston showed

vacillation and indecision.  He left Corinth on the 2d of April

and was not ready to attack until the 6th.  The distance his

army had to march was less than twenty miles.  Beauregard, his

second in command, was opposed to the attack for two reasons:

first, he thought, if let alone the National troops would attack

the Confederates in their intrenchments; second, we were in

ground of our own choosing and would necessarily be

intrenched.  Johnston not only listened to the objection of

Beauregard to an attack, but held a council of war on the

subject on the morning of the 5th.  On the evening of the same

day he was in consultation with some of his generals on the same

subject, and still again on the morning of the 6th.  During this

last consultation, and before a decision had been reached, the

battle began by the National troops opening fire on the enemy.

This seemed to settle the question as to whether there was to be

any battle of Shiloh.  It also seems to me to settle the question

as to whether there was a surprise.



I do not question the personal courage of General Johnston, or

his ability.  But he did not win the distinction predicted for

him by many of his friends.  He did prove that as a general he

was over-estimated.



General Beauregard was next in rank to Johnston and succeeded to

the command, which he retained to the close of the battle and

during the subsequent retreat on Corinth, as well as in the

siege of that place.  His tactics have been severely criticised

by Confederate writers, but I do not believe his fallen chief

could have done any better under the circumstances.  Some of

these critics claim that Shiloh was won when Johnston fell, and

that if he had not fallen the army under me would have been

annihilated or captured.  IFS defeated the Confederates at

Shiloh.  There is little doubt that we would have been

disgracefully beaten IF all the shells and bullets fired by us

had passed harmlessly over the enemy and IF all of theirs had

taken effect.  Commanding generals are liable to be killed

during engagements; and the fact that when he was shot Johnston

was leading a brigade to induce it to make a charge which had

been repeatedly ordered, is evidence that there was neither the

universal demoralization on our side nor the unbounded

confidence on theirs which has been claimed.  There was, in

fact, no hour during the day when I doubted the eventual defeat

of the enemy, although I was disappointed that reinforcements so

near at hand did not arrive at an earlier hour.



The description of the battle of Shiloh given by Colonel Wm.

Preston Johnston is very graphic and well told.  The reader will

imagine that he can see each blow struck, a demoralized and

broken mob of Union soldiers, each blow sending the enemy more

demoralized than ever towards the Tennessee River, which was a

little more than two miles away at the beginning of the onset.

If the reader does not stop to inquire why, with such

Confederate success for more than twelve hours of hard fighting,

the National troops were not all killed, captured or driven into

the river, he will regard the pen picture as perfect.  But I

witnessed the fight from the National side from eight o'clock in

the morning until night closed the contest.  I see but little in

the description that I can recognize.  The Confederate troops

fought well and deserve commendation enough for their bravery

and endurance on the 6th of April, without detracting from their

antagonists or claiming anything more than their just dues.



The reports of the enemy show that their condition at the end of

the first day was deplorable; their losses in killed and wounded

had been very heavy, and their stragglers had been quite as

numerous as on the National side, with the difference that those

of the enemy left the field entirely and were not brought back to

their respective commands for many days.  On the Union side but

few of the stragglers fell back further than the landing on the

river, and many of these were in line for duty on the second

day.  The admissions of the highest Confederate officers engaged

at Shiloh make the claim of a victory for them absurd.  The

victory was not to either party until the battle was over.  It

was then a Union victory, in which the Armies of the Tennessee

and the Ohio both participated.  But the Army of the Tennessee

fought the entire rebel army on the 6th and held it at bay until

near night; and night alone closed the conflict and not the three

regiments of Nelson's division.



The Confederates fought with courage at Shiloh, but the

particular skill claimed I could not and still cannot see;

though there is nothing to criticise except the claims put

forward for it since.  But the Confederate claimants for

superiority in strategy, superiority in generalship and

superiority in dash and prowess are not so unjust to the Union

troops engaged at Shiloh as are many Northern writers.  The

troops on both sides were American, and united they need not

fear any foreign foe.  It is possible that the Southern man

started in with a little more dash than his Northern brother;

but he was correspondingly less enduring.



The endeavor of the enemy on the first day was simply to hurl

their men against ours--first at one point, then at another,

sometimes at several points at once.  This they did with daring

and energy, until at night the rebel troops were worn out.  Our

effort during the same time was to be prepared to resist

assaults wherever made.  The object of the Confederates on the

second day was to get away with as much of their army and

material as possible.  Ours then was to drive them from our

front, and to capture or destroy as great a part as possible of

their men and material.  We were successful in driving them

back, but not so successful in captures as if farther pursuit

could have been made.  As it was, we captured or recaptured on

the second day about as much artillery as we lost on the first;

and, leaving out the one great capture of Prentiss, we took more

prisoners on Monday than the enemy gained from us on Sunday.  On

the 6th Sherman lost seven pieces of artillery, McClernand six,

Prentiss eight, and Hurlbut two batteries.  On the 7th Sherman

captured seven guns, McClernand three and the Army of the Ohio

twenty.



At Shiloh the effective strength of the Union forces on the

morning of the 6th was 33,000 men.  Lew. Wallace brought 5,000

more after nightfall.  Beauregard reported the enemy's strength

at 40,955.  According to the custom of enumeration in the South,

this number probably excluded every man enlisted as musician or

detailed as guard or nurse, and all commissioned officers--

everybody who did not carry a musket or serve a cannon. With us

everybody in the field receiving pay from the government is

counted.  Excluding the troops who fled, panic-stricken, before

they had fired a shot, there was not a time during the 6th when

we had more than 25,000 men in line. On the 7th Buell brought

20,000 more.  Of his remaining two divisions, Thomas's did not

reach the field during the engagement; Wood's arrived before

firing had ceased, but not in time to be of much service.



Our loss in the two days' fight was 1,754 killed, 8,408 wounded

and 2,885 missing.  Of these, 2,103 were in the Army of the

Ohio.  Beauregard reported a total loss of 10,699, of whom 1,728

were killed, 8,012 wounded and 957 missing.  This estimate must

be incorrect.  We buried, by actual count, more of the enemy's

dead in front of the divisions of McClernand and Sherman alone

than here reported, and 4,000 was the estimate of the burial

parties of the whole field.  Beauregard reports the Confederate

force on the 6th at over 40,000, and their total loss during the

two days at 10,699; and at the same time declares that he could

put only 20,000 men in battle on the morning of the 7th.



The navy gave a hearty support to the army at Shiloh, as indeed

it always did both before and subsequently when I was in

command.  The nature of the ground was such, however, that on

this occasion it could do nothing in aid of the troops until

sundown on the first day.  The country was broken and heavily

timbered, cutting off all view of the battle from the river, so

that friends would be as much in danger from fire from the

gunboats as the foe.  But about sundown, when the National

troops were back in their last position, the right of the enemy

was near the river and exposed to the fire of the two gun-boats,

which was delivered with vigor and effect.  After nightfall, when

firing had entirely ceased on land, the commander of the fleet

informed himself, approximately, of the position of our troops

and suggested the idea of dropping a shell within the lines of

the enemy every fifteen minutes during the night.  This was done

with effect, as is proved by the Confederate reports.



Up to the battle of Shiloh I, as well as thousands of other

citizens, believed that the rebellion against the Government

would collapse suddenly and soon, if a decisive victory could be

gained over any of its armies.  Donelson and Henry were such

victories.  An army of more than 21,000 men was captured or

destroyed.  Bowling Green, Columbus and Hickman, Kentucky, fell

in consequence, and Clarksville and Nashville, Tennessee, the

last two with an immense amount of stores, also fell into our

hands.  The Tennessee and Cumberland rivers, from their mouths

to the head of navigation, were secured.  But when Confederate

armies were collected which not only attempted to hold a line

farther south, from Memphis to Chattanooga, Knoxville and on to

the Atlantic, but assumed the offensive and made such a gallant

effort to regain what had been lost, then, indeed, I gave up all

idea of saving the Union except by complete conquest.  Up to that

time it had been the policy of our army, certainly of that

portion commanded by me, to protect the property of the citizens

whose territory was invaded, without regard to their sentiments,

whether Union or Secession.  After this, however, I regarded it

as humane to both sides to protect the persons of those found at

their homes, but to consume everything that could be used to

support or supply armies.  Protection was still continued over

such supplies as were within lines held by us and which we

expected to continue to hold; but such supplies within the reach

of Confederate armies I regarded as much contraband as arms or

ordnance stores.  Their destruction was accomplished without

bloodshed and tended to the same result as the destruction of

armies.  I continued this policy to the close of the war.

Promiscuous pillaging, however, was discouraged and punished.

Instructions were always given to take provisions and forage

under the direction of commissioned officers who should give

receipts to owners, if at home, and turn the property over to

officers of the quartermaster or commissary departments to be

issued as if furnished from our Northern depots.  But much was

destroyed without receipts to owners, when it could not be

brought within our lines and would otherwise have gone to the

support of secession and rebellion.



This policy I believe exercised a material influence in

hastening the end.



The battle of Shiloh, or Pittsburg landing, has been perhaps

less understood, or, to state the case more accurately, more

persistently misunderstood, than any other engagement between

National and Confederate troops during the entire rebellion.

Correct reports of the battle have been published, notably by

Sherman, Badeau and, in a speech before a meeting of veterans,

by General Prentiss; but all of these appeared long subsequent

to the close of the rebellion and after public opinion had been

most erroneously formed.



I myself made no report to General Halleck, further than was

contained in a letter, written immediately after the battle

informing him that an engagement had been fought and announcing

the result.  A few days afterwards General Halleck moved his

headquarters to Pittsburg landing and assumed command of the

troops in the field.  Although next to him in rank, and

nominally in command of my old district and army, I was ignored

as much as if I had been at the most distant point of territory

within my jurisdiction; and although I was in command of all the

troops engaged at Shiloh I was not permitted to see one of the

reports of General Buell or his subordinates in that battle,

until they were published by the War Department long after the

event.  For this reason I never made a full official report of

this engagement.
