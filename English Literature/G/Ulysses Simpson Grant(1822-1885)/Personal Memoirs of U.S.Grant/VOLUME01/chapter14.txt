RETURN OF THE ARMY--MARRIAGE--ORDERED TO THE PACIFIC

COAST--CROSSING THE ISTHMUS--ARRIVAL AT SAN FRANCISCO.



My experience in the Mexican war was of great advantage to me

afterwards.  Besides the many practical lessons it taught, the

war brought nearly all the officers of the regular army together

so as to make them personally acquainted.  It also brought them

in contact with volunteers, many of whom served in the war of

the rebellion afterwards.  Then, in my particular case, I had

been at West Point at about the right time to meet most of the

graduates who were of a suitable age at the breaking out of the

rebellion to be trusted with large commands.  Graduating in

1843, I was at the military academy from one to four years with

all cadets who graduated between 1840 and 1846--seven classes.

These classes embraced more than fifty officers who afterwards

became generals on one side or the other in the rebellion, many

of them holding high commands.  All the older officers, who

became conspicuous in the rebellion, I had also served with and

known in Mexico:  Lee, J. E. Johnston, A. S. Johnston, Holmes,

Hebert and a number of others on the Confederate side; McCall,

Mansfield, Phil. Kearney and others on the National side.  The

acquaintance thus formed was of immense service to me in the war

of the rebellion--I mean what I learned of the characters of

those to whom I was afterwards opposed.  I do not pretend to say

that all movements, or even many of them, were made with special

reference to the characteristics of the commander against whom

they were directed.  But my appreciation of my enemies was

certainly affected by this knowledge.  The natural disposition

of most people is to clothe a commander of a large army whom

they do not know, with almost superhuman abilities.  A large

part of the National army, for instance, and most of the press

of the country, clothed General Lee with just such qualities,

but I had known him personally, and knew that he was mortal; and

it was just as well that I felt this.



The treaty of peace was at last ratified, and the evacuation of

Mexico by United States troops was ordered.  Early in June the

troops in the City of Mexico began to move out.  Many of them,

including the brigade to which I belonged, were assembled at

Jalapa, above the vomito, to await the arrival of transports at

Vera Cruz:  but with all this precaution my regiment and others

were in camp on the sand beach in a July sun, for about a week

before embarking, while the fever raged with great virulence in

Vera Cruz, not two miles away.  I can call to mind only one

person, an officer, who died of the disease.  My regiment was

sent to Pascagoula, Mississippi, to spend the summer.  As soon

as it was settled in camp I obtained a leave of absence for four

months and proceeded to St. Louis.  On the 22d of August, 1848, I

was married to Miss Julia Dent, the lady of whom I have before

spoken.  We visited my parents and relations in Ohio, and, at

the end of my leave, proceeded to my post at Sackett's Harbor,

New York.  In April following I was ordered to Detroit,

Michigan, where two years were spent with but few important

incidents.



The present constitution of the State of Michigan was ratified

during this time.  By the terms of one of its provisions, all

citizens of the United States residing within the State at the

time of the ratification became citizens of Michigan also.

During my stay in Detroit there was an election for city

officers.  Mr. Zachariah Chandler was the candidate of the Whigs

for the office of Mayor, and was elected, although the city was

then reckoned democratic.  All the officers stationed there at

the time who offered their votes were permitted to cast them.  I

did not offer mine, however, as I did not wish to consider myself

a citizen of Michigan.  This was Mr. Chandler's first entry into

politics, a career he followed ever after with great success,

and in which he died enjoying the friendship, esteem and love of

his countrymen.



In the spring of 1851 the garrison at Detroit was transferred to

Sackett's Harbor, and in the following spring the entire 4th

infantry was ordered to the Pacific Coast.  It was decided that

Mrs. Grant should visit my parents at first for a few months,

and then remain with her own family at their St. Louis home

until an opportunity offered of sending for her.  In the month

of April the regiment was assembled at Governor's Island, New

York Harbor, and on the 5th of July eight companies sailed for

Aspinwall.  We numbered a little over seven hundred persons,

including the families of officers and soldiers.  Passage was

secured for us on the old steamer Ohio, commanded at the time by

Captain Schenck, of the navy.  It had not been determined, until

a day or two before starting, that the 4th infantry should go by

the Ohio; consequently, a complement of passengers had already

been secured.  The addition of over seven hundred to this list

crowded the steamer most uncomfortably, especially for the

tropics in July.



In eight days Aspinwall was reached.  At that time the streets

of the town were eight or ten inches under water, and foot

passengers passed from place to place on raised foot-walks. July

is at the height of the wet season, on the Isthmus.  At intervals

the rain would pour down in streams, followed in not many minutes

by a blazing, tropical summer's sun.  These alternate changes,

from rain to sunshine, were continuous in the afternoons.  I

wondered how any person could live many months in Aspinwall, and

wondered still more why any one tried.



In the summer of 1852 the Panama railroad was completed only to

the point where it now crosses the Chagres River.  From there

passengers were carried by boats to Gorgona, at which place they

took mules for Panama, some twenty-five miles further.  Those who

travelled over the Isthmus in those days will remember that boats

on the Chagres River were propelled by natives not inconveniently

burdened with clothing.  These boats carried thirty to forty

passengers each.  The crews consisted of six men to a boat,

armed with long poles.  There were planks wide enough for a man

to walk on conveniently, running along the sides of each boat

from end to end.  The men would start from the bow, place one

end of their poles against the river bottom, brace their

shoulders against the other end, and then walk to the stern as

rapidly as they could.  In this way from a mile to a mile and a

half an hour could be made, against the current of the river.



I, as regimental quartermaster, had charge of the public

property and had also to look after the transportation.  A

contract had been entered into with the steamship company in New

York for the transportation of the regiment to California,

including the Isthmus transit.  A certain amount of baggage was

allowed per man, and saddle animals were to be furnished to

commissioned officers and to all disabled persons.  The

regiment, with the exception of one company left as guards to

the public property--camp and garrison equipage principally--and

the soldiers with families, took boats, propelled as above

described, for Gorgona.  From this place they marched to Panama,

and were soon comfortably on the steamer anchored in the bay,

some three or four miles from the town.  I, with one company of

troops and all the soldiers with families, all the tents, mess

chests and camp kettles, was sent to Cruces, a town a few miles

higher up the Chagres River than Gorgona.  There I found an

impecunious American who had taken the contract to furnish

transportation for the regiment at a stipulated price per

hundred pounds for the freight and so much for each saddle

animal.  But when we reached Cruces there was not a mule, either

for pack or saddle, in the place.  The contractor promised that

the animals should be on hand in the morning.  In the morning he

said that they were on the way from some imaginary place, and

would arrive in the course of the day.  This went on until I saw

that he could not procure the animals at all at the price he had

promised to furnish them for.  The unusual number of passengers

that had come over on the steamer, and the large amount of

freight to pack, had created an unprecedented demand for

mules.  Some of the passengers paid as high as forty dollars for

the use of a mule to ride twenty-five miles, when the mule would

not have sold for ten dollars in that market at other times.

Meanwhile the cholera had broken out, and men were dying every

hour.  To diminish the food for the disease, I permitted the

company detailed with me to proceed to Panama.  The captain and

the doctors accompanied the men, and I was left alone with the

sick and the soldiers who had families.  The regiment at Panama

was also affected with the disease; but there were better

accommodations for the well on the steamer, and a hospital, for

those taken with the disease, on an old hulk anchored a mile

off.  There were also hospital tents on shore on the island of

Flamingo, which stands in the bay.



I was about a week at Cruces before transportation began to come

in.  About one-third of the people with me died, either at Cruces

or on the way to Panama.  There was no agent of the

transportation company at Cruces to consult, or to take the

responsibility of procuring transportation at a price which

would secure it.  I therefore myself dismissed the contractor

and made a new contract with a native, at more than double the

original price.  Thus we finally reached Panama.  The steamer,

however, could not proceed until the cholera abated, and the

regiment was detained still longer.  Altogether, on the Isthmus

and on the Pacific side, we were delayed six weeks.  About

one-seventh of those who left New York harbor with the 4th

infantry on the 5th of July, now lie buried on the Isthmus of

Panama or on Flamingo island in Panama Bay.



One amusing circumstance occurred while we were Iying at anchor

in Panama Bay.  In the regiment there was a Lieutenant Slaughter

who was very liable to sea-sickness.  It almost made him sick to

see the wave of a table-cloth when the servants were spreading

it.  Soon after his graduation, Slaughter was ordered to

California and took passage by a sailing vessel going around

Cape Horn.  The vessel was seven months making the voyage, and

Slaughter was sick every moment of the time, never more so than

while Iying at anchor after reaching his place of destination.

On landing in California he found orders which had come by the

Isthmus, notifying him of a mistake in his assignment; he should

have been ordered to the northern lakes.  He started back by the

Isthmus route and was sick all the way.  But when he arrived at

the East he was again ordered to California, this time

definitely, and at this date was making his third trip.  He was

as sick as ever, and had been so for more than a month while

lying at anchor in the bay.  I remember him well, seated with

his elbows on the table in front of him, his chin between his

hands, and looking the picture of despair.  At last he broke

out, "I wish I had taken my father's advice; he wanted me to go

into the navy; if I had done so, I should not have had to go to

sea so much."  Poor Slaughter! it was his last sea voyage.  He

was killed by Indians in Oregon.



By the last of August the cholera had so abated that it was

deemed safe to start.  The disease did not break out again on

the way to California, and we reached San Francisco early in

September.
