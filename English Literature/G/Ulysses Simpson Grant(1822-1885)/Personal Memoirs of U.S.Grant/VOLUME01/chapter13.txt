TREATY OF PEACE--MEXICAN BULL FIGHTS--REGIMENTAL

QUARTERMASTER--TRIP TO POPOCATAPETL--TRIP TO THE CAVES OF MEXICO.



The treaty of peace between the two countries was signed by the

commissioners of each side early in February, 1848.  It took a

considerable time for it to reach Washington, receive the

approval of the administration, and be finally ratified by the

Senate.  It was naturally supposed by the army that there would

be no more fighting, and officers and men were of course anxious

to get home, but knowing there must be delay they contented

themselves as best they could.  Every Sunday there was a bull

fight for the amusement of those who would pay their fifty

cents.  I attended one of them--just one--not wishing to leave

the country without having witnessed the national sport.  The

sight to me was sickening.  I could not see how human beings

could enjoy the sufferings of beasts, and often of men, as they

seemed to do on these occasions.



At these sports there are usually from four to six bulls

sacrificed.  The audience occupies seats around the ring in

which the exhibition is given, each seat but the foremost rising

higher than the one in front, so that every one can get a full

view of the sport.  When all is ready a bull is turned into the

ring.  Three or four men come in, mounted on the merest

skeletons of horses blind or blind-folded and so weak that they

could not make a sudden turn with their riders without danger of

falling down.  The men are armed with spears having a point as

sharp as a needle.  Other men enter the arena on foot, armed

with red flags and explosives about the size of a musket

cartridge.  To each of these explosives is fastened a barbed

needle which serves the purpose of attaching them to the bull by

running the needle into the skin.  Before the animal is turned

loose a lot of these explosives are attached to him.  The pain

from the pricking of the skin by the needles is exasperating;

but when the explosions of the cartridges commence the animal

becomes frantic.  As he makes a lunge towards one horseman,

another runs a spear into him.  He turns towards his last

tormentor when a man on foot holds out a red flag; the bull

rushes for this and is allowed to take it on his horns.  The

flag drops and covers the eyes of the animal so that he is at a

loss what to do; it is jerked from him and the torment is

renewed.  When the animal is worked into an uncontrollable

frenzy, the horsemen withdraw, and the matadores--literally

murderers--enter, armed with knives having blades twelve or

eighteen inches long, and sharp.  The trick is to dodge an

attack from the animal and stab him to the heart as he passes.

If these efforts fail the bull is finally lassoed, held fast and

killed by driving a knife blade into the spinal column just back

of the horns.  He is then dragged out by horses or mules,

another is let into the ring, and the same performance is

renewed.



On the occasion when I was present one of the bulls was not

turned aside by the attacks in the rear, the presentations of

the red flag, etc., etc., but kept right on, and placing his

horns under the flanks of a horse threw him and his rider to the

ground with great force.  The horse was killed and the rider lay

prostrate as if dead.  The bull was then lassoed and killed in

the manner above described.  Men came in and carried the dead

man off in a litter.  When the slaughtered bull and horse were

dragged out, a fresh bull was turned into the ring.  Conspicuous

among the spectators was the man who had been carried out on a

litter but a few minutes before.  He was only dead so far as

that performance went; but the corpse was so lively that it

could not forego the chance of witnessing the discomfiture of

some of his brethren who might not be so fortunate.  There was a

feeling of disgust manifested by the audience to find that he had

come to life again.  I confess that I felt sorry to see the

cruelty to the bull and the horse.  I did not stay for the

conclusion of the performance; but while I did stay, there was

not a bull killed in the prescribed way.



Bull fights are now prohibited in the Federal District--

embracing a territory around the City of Mexico, somewhat larger

than the District of Columbia--and they are not an institution in

any part of the country.  During one of my recent visits to

Mexico, bull fights were got up in my honor at Puebla and at

Pachuca.  I was not notified in advance so as to be able to

decline and thus prevent the performance; but in both cases I

civilly declined to attend.



Another amusement of the people of Mexico of that day, and one

which nearly all indulged in, male and female, old and young,

priest and layman, was Monte playing.  Regular feast weeks were

held every year at what was then known as St. Augustin Tlalpam,

eleven miles out of town.  There were dealers to suit every

class and condition of people.  In many of the booths

tlackos--the copper coin of the country, four of them making six

and a quarter cents of our money--were piled up in great

quantities, with some silver, to accommodate the people who

could not bet more than a few pennies at a time.  In other

booths silver formed the bulk of the capital of the bank, with a

few doubloons to be changed if there should be a run of luck

against the bank.  In some there was no coin except gold.  Here

the rich were said to bet away their entire estates in a single

day.  All this is stopped now.



For myself, I was kept somewhat busy during the winter of

1847-8.  My regiment was stationed in Tacubaya.  I was

regimental quartermaster and commissary.  General Scott had been

unable to get clothing for the troops from the North.  The men

were becoming--well, they needed clothing.  Material had to be

purchased, such as could be obtained, and people employed to

make it up into "Yankee uniforms."  A quartermaster in the city

was designated to attend to this special duty; but clothing was

so much needed that it was seized as fast as made up.  A

regiment was glad to get a dozen suits at a time.  I had to look

after this matter for the 4th infantry.  Then our regimental fund

had run down and some of the musicians in the band had been

without their extra pay for a number of months.



The regimental bands at that day were kept up partly by pay from

the government, and partly by pay from the regimental fund. There

was authority of law for enlisting a certain number of men as

musicians.  So many could receive the pay of non-commissioned

officers of the various grades, and the remainder the pay of

privates.  This would not secure a band leader, nor good players

on certain instruments.  In garrison there are various ways of

keeping up a regimental fund sufficient to give extra pay to

musicians, establish libraries and ten-pin alleys, subscribe to

magazines and furnish many extra comforts to the men.  The best

device for supplying the fund is to issue bread to the soldiers

instead of flour.  The ration used to be eighteen ounces per day

of either flour or bread; and one hundred pounds of flour will

make one hundred and forty pounds of bread.  This saving was

purchased by the commissary for the benefit of the fund.  In the

emergency the 4th infantry was laboring under, I rented a bakery

in the city, hired bakers--Mexicans--bought fuel and whatever

was necessary, and I also got a contract from the chief

commissary of the army for baking a large amount of hard

bread.  In two months I made more money for the fund than my pay

amounted to during the entire war.  While stationed at Monterey I

had relieved the post fund in the same way.  There, however, was

no profit except in the saving of flour by converting it into

bread.



In the spring of 1848 a party of officers obtained leave to

visit Popocatapetl, the highest volcano in America, and to take

an escort.  I went with the party, many of whom afterwards

occupied conspicuous positions before the country.  Of those who

"went south," and attained high rank, there was Lieutenant

Richard Anderson, who commanded a corps at Spottsylvania;

Captain Sibley, a major-general, and, after the war, for a

number of years in the employ of the Khedive of Egypt; Captain

George Crittenden, a rebel general; S. B. Buckner, who

surrendered Fort Donelson; and Mansfield Lovell, who commanded

at New Orleans before that city fell into the hands of the

National troops.  Of those who remained on our side there were

Captain Andrew Porter, Lieutenant C. P. Stone and Lieutenant Z.

B. Tower.  There were quite a number of other officers, whose

names I cannot recollect.



At a little village (Ozumba) near the base of Popocatapetl,

where we purposed to commence the ascent, we procured guides and

two pack mules with forage for our horses.  High up on the

mountain there was a deserted house of one room, called the

Vaqueria, which had been occupied years before by men in charge

of cattle ranging on the mountain.  The pasturage up there was

very fine when we saw it, and there were still some cattle,

descendants of the former domestic herd, which had now become

wild.  It was possible to go on horseback as far as the

Vaqueria, though the road was somewhat hazardous in places.

Sometimes it was very narrow with a yawning precipice on one

side, hundreds of feet down to a roaring mountain torrent below,

and almost perpendicular walls on the other side.  At one of

these places one of our mules loaded with two sacks of barley,

one on each side, the two about as big as he was, struck his

load against the mountain-side and was precipitated to the

bottom.  The descent was steep but not perpendicular.  The mule

rolled over and over until the bottom was reached, and we

supposed of course the poor animal was dashed to pieces.  What

was our surprise, not long after we had gone into bivouac, to

see the lost mule, cargo and owner coming up the ascent.  The

load had protected the animal from serious injury; and his owner

had gone after him and found a way back to the path leading up to

the hut where we were to stay.




The night at the Vaqueria was one of the most unpleasant I ever

knew.  It was very cold and the rain fell in torrents.  A little

higher up the rain ceased and snow began.  The wind blew with

great velocity.  The log-cabin we were in had lost the roof

entirely on one side, and on the other it was hardly better then

a sieve.  There was little or no sleep that night.  As soon as it

was light the next morning, we started to make the ascent to the

summit.  The wind continued to blow with violence and the

weather was still cloudy, but there was neither rain nor snow.

The clouds, however, concealed from our view the country below

us, except at times a momentary glimpse could be got through a

clear space between them.  The wind carried the loose snow

around the mountain-sides in such volumes as to make it almost

impossible to stand up against it.  We labored on and on, until

it became evident that the top could not be reached before

night, if at all in such a storm, and we concluded to return.

The descent was easy and rapid, though dangerous, until we got

below the snow line.  At the cabin we mounted our horses, and by

night were at Ozumba.



The fatigues of the day and the loss of sleep the night before

drove us to bed early.  Our beds consisted of a place on the

dirt-floor with a blanket under us.  Soon all were asleep; but

long before morning first one and then another of our party

began to cry out with excruciating pain in the eyes.  Not one

escaped it.  By morning the eyes of half the party were so

swollen that they were entirely closed.  The others suffered

pain equally.  The feeling was about what might be expected from

the prick of a sharp needle at a white heat.  We remained in

quarters until the afternoon bathing our eyes in cold water.

This relieved us very much, and before night the pain had

entirely left.  The swelling, however, continued, and about half

the party still had their eyes entirely closed; but we concluded

to make a start back, those who could see a little leading the

horses of those who could not see at all.  We moved back to the

village of Ameca Ameca, some six miles, and stopped again for

the night.  The next morning all were entirely well and free

from pain.  The weather was clear and Popocatapetl stood out in

all its beauty, the top looking as if not a mile away, and

inviting us to return.  About half the party were anxious to try

the ascent again, and concluded to do so.  The remainder--I was

with the remainder--concluded that we had got all the pleasure

there was to be had out of mountain climbing, and that we would

visit the great caves of Mexico, some ninety miles from where we

then were, on the road to Acapulco.



The party that ascended the mountain the second time succeeded

in reaching the crater at the top, with but little of the labor

they encountered in their first attempt.  Three of them--

Anderson, Stone and Buckner--wrote accounts of their journey,

which were published at the time.  I made no notes of this

excursion, and have read nothing about it since, but it seems to

me that I can see the whole of it as vividly as if it were but

yesterday.  I have been back at Ameca Ameca, and the village

beyond, twice in the last five years.  The scene had not changed

materially from my recollection of it.



The party which I was with moved south down the valley to the

town of Cuantla, some forty miles from Ameca Ameca.  The latter

stands on the plain at the foot of Popocatapetl, at an elevation

of about eight thousand feet above tide water.  The slope down is

gradual as the traveller moves south, but one would not judge

that, in going to Cuantla, descent enough had been made to

occasion a material change in the climate and productions of the

soil; but such is the case.  In the morning we left a temperate

climate where the cereals and fruits are those common to the

United States, we halted in the evening in a tropical climate

where the orange and banana, the coffee and the sugar-cane were

flourishing.  We had been travelling, apparently, on a plain all

day, but in the direction of the flow of water.



Soon after the capture of the City of Mexico an armistice had

been agreed to, designating the limits beyond which troops of

the respective armies were not to go during its continuance. Our

party knew nothing about these limits.  As we approached Cuantla

bugles sounded the assembly, and soldiers rushed from the

guard-house in the edge of the town towards us.  Our party

halted, and I tied a white pocket handkerchief to a stick and,

using it as a flag of truce, proceeded on to the town.  Captains

Sibley and Porter followed a few hundred yards behind.  I was

detained at the guard-house until a messenger could be

dispatched to the quarters of the commanding general, who

authorized that I should be conducted to him.  I had been with

the general but a few minutes when the two officers following

announced themselves.  The Mexican general reminded us that it

was a violation of the truce for us to be there.  However, as we

had no special authority from our own commanding general, and as

we knew nothing about the terms of the truce, we were permitted

to occupy a vacant house outside the guard for the night, with

the promise of a guide to put us on the road to Cuernavaca the

next morning.



Cuernavaca is a town west of Guantla.  The country through which

we passed, between these two towns, is tropical in climate and

productions and rich in scenery.  At one point, about half-way

between the two places, the road goes over a low pass in the

mountains in which there is a very quaint old town, the

inhabitants of which at that day were nearly all full-blooded

Indians.  Very few of them even spoke Spanish.  The houses were

built of stone and generally only one story high.  The streets

were narrow, and had probably been paved before Cortez visited

the country.  They had not been graded, but the paving had been

done on the natural surface.  We had with us one vehicle, a

cart, which was probably the first wheeled vehicle that had ever

passed through that town.



On a hill overlooking this town stands the tomb of an ancient

king; and it was understood that the inhabitants venerated this

tomb very highly, as well as the memory of the ruler who was

supposed to be buried in it.  We ascended the mountain and

surveyed the tomb; but it showed no particular marks of

architectural taste, mechanical skill or advanced

civilization.  The next day we went into Cuernavaca.



After a day's rest at Cuernavaca our party set out again on the

journey to the great caves of Mexico.  We had proceeded but a

few miles when we were stopped, as before, by a guard and

notified that the terms of the existing armistice did not permit

us to go further in that direction.  Upon convincing the guard

that we were a mere party of pleasure seekers desirous of

visiting the great natural curiosities of the country which we

expected soon to leave, we were conducted to a large hacienda

near by, and directed to remain there until the commanding

general of that department could be communicated with and his

decision obtained as to whether we should be permitted to pursue

our journey.  The guard promised to send a messenger at once, and

expected a reply by night.  At night there was no response from

the commanding general, but the captain of the guard was sure he

would have a reply by morning.  Again in the morning there was no

reply.  The second evening the same thing happened, and finally

we learned that the guard had sent no message or messenger to

the department commander.  We determined therefore to go on

unless stopped by a force sufficient to compel obedience.



After a few hours' travel we came to a town where a scene

similar to the one at Cuantia occurred.  The commanding officer

sent a guide to conduct our party around the village and to put

us upon our road again.  This was the last interruption:  that

night we rested at a large coffee plantation, some eight miles

from the cave we were on the way to visit.  It must have been a

Saturday night; the peons had been paid off, and spent part of

the night in gambling away their scanty week's earnings.  Their

coin was principally copper, and I do not believe there was a

man among them who had received as much as twenty-five cents in

money.  They were as much excited, however, as if they had been

staking thousands.  I recollect one poor fellow, who had lost

his last tlacko, pulled off his shirt and, in the most excited

manner, put that up on the turn of a card.  Monte was the game

played, the place out of doors, near the window of the room

occupied by the officers of our party.



The next morning we were at the mouth of the cave at an early

hour, provided with guides, candles and rockets.  We explored to

a distance of about three miles from the entrance, and found a

succession of chambers of great dimensions and of great beauty

when lit up with our rockets.  Stalactites and stalagmites of

all sizes were discovered.  Some of the former were many feet in

diameter and extended from ceiling to floor; some of the latter

were but a few feet high from the floor; but the formation is

going on constantly, and many centuries hence these stalagmites

will extend to the ceiling and become complete columns.  The

stalagmites were all a little concave, and the cavities were

filled with water.  The water percolates through the roof, a

drop at a time--often the drops several minutes apart--and more

or less charged with mineral matter.  Evaporation goes on

slowly, leaving the mineral behind.  This in time makes the

immense columns, many of them thousands of tons in weight, which

serve to support the roofs over the vast chambers.  I recollect

that at one point in the cave one of these columns is of such

huge proportions that there is only a narrow passage left on

either side of it.  Some of our party became satisfied with

their explorations before we had reached the point to which the

guides were accustomed to take explorers, and started back

without guides.  Coming to the large column spoken of, they

followed it entirely around, and commenced retracing their steps

into the bowels of the mountain, without being aware of the

fact.  When the rest of us had completed our explorations, we

started out with our guides, but had not gone far before we saw

the torches of an approaching party.  We could not conceive who

these could be, for all of us had come in together, and there

were none but ourselves at the entrance when we started in. Very

soon we found it was our friends.  It took them some time to

conceive how they had got where they were.  They were sure they

had kept straight on for the mouth of the cave, and had gone

about far enough to have reached it.
