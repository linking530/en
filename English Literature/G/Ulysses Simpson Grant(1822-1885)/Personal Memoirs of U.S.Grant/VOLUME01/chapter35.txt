MOVEMENT AGAINST JACKSON--FALL OF JACKSON--INTERCEPTING THE

ENEMY--BATTLE OF CHAMPION'S HILL.



When the news reached me of McPherson's victory at Raymond about

sundown my position was with Sherman.  I decided at once to turn

the whole column towards Jackson and capture that place without

delay.



Pemberton was now on my left, with, as I supposed, about 18,000

men; in fact, as I learned afterwards, with nearly 50,000.  A

force was also collecting on my right, at Jackson, the point

where all the railroads communicating with Vicksburg connect.

All the enemy's supplies of men and stores would come by that

point.  As I hoped in the end to besiege Vicksburg I must first

destroy all possibility of aid.  I therefore determined to move

swiftly towards Jackson, destroy or drive any force in that

direction and then turn upon Pemberton.  But by moving against

Jackson, I uncovered my own communication.  So I finally decided

to have none--to cut loose altogether from my base and move my

whole force eastward.  I then had no fears for my

communications, and if I moved quickly enough could turn upon

Pemberton before he could attack me in the rear.



Accordingly, all previous orders given during the day for

movements on the 13th were annulled by new ones.  McPherson was

ordered at daylight to move on Clinton, ten miles from Jackson;

Sherman was notified of my determination to capture Jackson and

work from there westward.  He was ordered to start at four in

the morning and march to Raymond.  McClernand was ordered to

march with three divisions by Dillon's to Raymond.  One was left

to guard the crossing of the Big Black.



On the 10th I had received a letter from Banks, on the Red

River, asking reinforcements.  Porter had gone to his assistance

with a part of his fleet on the 3d, and I now wrote to him

describing my position and declining to send any troops.  I

looked upon side movements as long as the enemy held Port Hudson

and Vicksburg as a waste of time and material.



General Joseph E. Johnston arrived at Jackson in the night of

the 13th from Tennessee, and immediately assumed command of all

the Confederate troops in Mississippi.  I knew he was expecting

reinforcements from the south and east. On the 6th I had written

to General Halleck:  "Information from the other side leaves me

to believe the enemy are bringing forces from Tullahoma."



Up to this time my troops had been kept in supporting distances

of each other, as far as the nature of the country would

admit.  Reconnoissances were constantly made from each corps to

enable them to acquaint themselves with the most practicable

routes from one to another in case a union became necessary.



McPherson reached Clinton with the advance early on the 13th and

immediately set to work destroying the railroad.  Sherman's

advance reached Raymond before the last of McPherson's command

had got out of the town.  McClernand withdrew from the front of

the enemy, at Edward's station, with much skill and without

loss, and reached his position for the night in good order.  On

the night of the 13th, McPherson was ordered to march at early

dawn upon Jackson, only fifteen miles away.  Sherman was given

the same order; but he was to move by the direct road from

Raymond to Jackson, which is south of the road McPherson was on

and does not approach within two miles of it at the point where

it crossed the line of intrenchments which, at that time,

defended the city.  McClernand was ordered to move one division

of his command to Clinton, one division a few miles beyond

Mississippi Springs following Sherman's line, and a third to

Raymond.  He was also directed to send his siege guns, four in

number with the troops going by Mississippi Springs.

McClernand's position was an advantageous one in any event. With

one division at Clinton he was in position to reinforce

McPherson, at Jackson, rapidly if it became necessary; the

division beyond Mississippi Springs was equally available to

reinforce Sherman; the one at Raymond could take either road. He

still had two other divisions farther back now that Blair had

come up, available within a day at Jackson.  If this last

command should not be wanted at Jackson, they were already one

day's march from there on their way to Vicksburg and on three

different roads leading to the latter city.  But the most

important consideration in my mind was to have a force

confronting Pemberton if he should come out to attack my rear.

This I expected him to do; as shown further on, he was directed

by Johnston to make this very move.



I notified General Halleck that I should attack the State

capital on the 14th.  A courier carried the dispatch to Grand

Gulf through an unprotected country.



Sherman and McPherson communicated with each other during the

night and arranged to reach Jackson at about the same hour.  It

rained in torrents during the night of the 13th and the fore

part of the day of the 14th.  The roads were intolerable, and in

some places on Sherman's line, where the land was low, they were

covered more than a foot deep with water.  But the troops never

murmured.  By nine o'clock Crocker, of McPherson's corps, who

was now in advance, came upon the enemy's pickets and speedily

drove them in upon the main body.  They were outside of the

intrenchments in a strong position, and proved to be the troops

that had been driven out of Raymond.  Johnston had been

reinforced; during the night by Georgia and South Carolina

regiments, so that his force amounted to eleven thousand men,

and he was expecting still more.



Sherman also came upon the rebel pickets some distance out from

the town, but speedily drove them in.  He was now on the south

and south-west of Jackson confronting the Confederates behind

their breastworks, while McPherson's right was nearly two miles

north, occupying a line running north and south across the

Vicksburg railroad.  Artillery was brought up and

reconnoissances made preparatory to an assault.  McPherson

brought up Logan's division while he deployed Crocker's for the

assault.  Sherman made similar dispositions on the right.  By

eleven A.M. both were ready to attack.  Crocker moved his

division forward, preceded by a strong skirmish line.  These

troops at once encountered the enemy's advance and drove it back

on the main body, when they returned to their proper regiment and

the whole division charged, routing the enemy completely and

driving him into this main line.  This stand by the enemy was

made more than two miles outside of his main fortifications.

McPherson followed up with his command until within range of the

guns of the enemy from their intrenchments, when he halted to

bring his troops into line and reconnoitre to determine the next

move.  It was now about noon.



While this was going on Sherman was confronting a rebel battery

which enfiladed the road on which he was marching--the

Mississippi Springs road--and commanded a bridge spanning a

stream over which he had to pass.  By detaching right and left

the stream was forced and the enemy flanked and speedily driven

within the main line.  This brought our whole line in front of

the enemy's line of works, which was continuous on the north,

west and south sides from the Pearl River north of the city to

the same river south.  I was with Sherman.  He was confronted by

a force sufficient to hold us back.  Appearances did not justify

an assault where we were.  I had directed Sherman to send a

force to the right, and to reconnoitre as far as to the Pearl

River.  This force, Tuttle's division, not returning I rode to

the right with my staff, and soon found that the enemy had left

that part of the line.  Tuttle's movement or McPherson's

pressure had no doubt led Johnston to order a retreat, leaving

only the men at the guns to retard us while he was getting

away.  Tuttle had seen this and, passing through the lines

without resistance, came up in the rear of the artillerists

confronting Sherman and captured them with ten pieces of

artillery.  I rode immediately to the State House, where I was

soon followed by Sherman.  About the same time McPherson

discovered that the enemy was leaving his front, and advanced

Crocker, who was so close upon the enemy that they could not

move their guns or destroy them.  He captured seven guns and,

moving on, hoisted the National flag over the rebel capital of

Mississippi.  Stevenson's brigade was sent to cut off the rebel

retreat, but was too late or not expeditious enough.



Our loss in this engagement was:  McPherson, 37 killed, 228

wounded; Sherman, 4 killed and 21 wounded and missing.  The

enemy lost 845 killed, wounded and captured.  Seventeen guns

fell into our hands, and the enemy destroyed by fire their

store-houses, containing a large amount of commissary stores.



On this day Blair reached New Auburn and joined McClernand's 4th

division.  He had with him two hundred wagons loaded with

rations, the only commissary supplies received during the entire

campaign.



I slept that night in the room that Johnston was said to have

occupied the night before.



About four in the afternoon I sent for the corps commanders and

directed the dispositions to be made of their troops.  Sherman

was to remain in Jackson until he destroyed that place as a

railroad centre, and manufacturing city of military supplies. He

did the work most effectually.  Sherman and I went together into

a manufactory which had not ceased work on account of the battle

nor for the entrance of Yankee troops.  Our presence did not seem

to attract the attention of either the manager or the operatives,

most of whom were girls.  We looked on for a while to see the

tent cloth which they were making roll out of the looms, with

"C. S. A."  woven in each bolt.  There was an immense amount of

cotton, in bales, stacked outside.  Finally I told Sherman I

thought they had done work enough.  The operatives were told

they could leave and take with them what cloth they could

carry.  In a few minutes cotton and factory were in a blaze. 

The proprietor visited Washington while I was President to get

his pay for this property, claiming that it was private.  He

asked me to give him a statement of the fact that his property

had been destroyed by National troops, so that he might use it

with Congress where he was pressing, or proposed to press, his

claim.  I declined.



On the night of the 13th Johnston sent the following dispatch to

Pemberton at Edward's station:  "I have lately arrived, and learn

that Major-General Sherman is between us with four divisions at

Clinton.  It is important to establish communication, that you

may be reinforced.  If practicable, come up in his rear at

once.  To beat such a detachment would be of immense value.  All

the troops you can quickly assemble should be brought.  Time is

all-important."  This dispatch was sent in triplicate, by

different messengers.  One of the messengers happened to be a

loyal man who had been expelled from Memphis some months before

by Hurlbut for uttering disloyal and threatening sentiments.

There was a good deal of parade about his expulsion, ostensibly

as a warning to those who entertained the sentiments he

expressed; but Hurlbut and the expelled man understood each

other.  He delivered his copy of Johnston's dispatch to

McPherson who forwarded it to me.



Receiving this dispatch on the 14th I ordered McPherson to move

promptly in the morning back to Bolton, the nearest point where

Johnston could reach the road.  Bolton is about twenty miles

west of Jackson.  I also informed McClernand of the capture of

Jackson and sent him the following order:  "It is evidently the

design of the enemy to get north of us and cross the Big Black,

and beat us into Vicksburg.  We must not allow them to do

this.  Turn all your forces towards Bolton station, and make all

dispatch in getting there.  Move troops by the most direct road

from wherever they may be on the receipt of this order."



And to Blair I wrote:  "Their design is evidently to cross the

Big Black and pass down the peninsula between the Big Black and

Yazoo rivers.  We must beat them.  Turn your troops immediately

to Bolton; take all the trains with you.  Smith's division, and

any other troops now with you, will go to the same place.  If

practicable, take parallel roads, so as to divide your troops

and train."



Johnston stopped on the Canton road only six miles north of

Jackson, the night of the 14th.  He sent from there to Pemberton

dispatches announcing the loss of Jackson, and the following

order:



"As soon as the reinforcements are all up, they must be united

to the rest of the army.  I am anxious to see a force assembled

that may be able to inflict a heavy blow upon the enemy.  Can

Grant supply himself from the Mississippi?  Can you not cut him

off from it, and above all, should he be compelled to fall back

for want of supplies, beat him."



The concentration of my troops was easy, considering the

character of the country.  McPherson moved along the road

parallel with and near the railroad.  McClernand's command was,

one division (Hovey's) on the road McPherson had to take, but

with a start of four miles.  One (Osterhaus) was at Raymond, on

a converging road that intersected the other near Champion's

Hill; one (Carr's) had to pass over the same road with

Osterhaus, but being back at Mississippi Springs, would not be

detained by it; the fourth (Smith's) with Blair's division, was

near Auburn with a different road to pass over.  McClernand

faced about and moved promptly.  His cavalry from Raymond seized

Bolton by half-past nine in the morning, driving out the enemy's

pickets and capturing several men.



The night of the 15th Hovey was at Bolton; Carr and Osterhaus

were about three miles south, but abreast, facing west; Smith

was north of Raymond with Blair in his rear.



McPherson's command, with Logan in front, had marched at seven

o'clock, and by four reached Hovey and went into camp; Crocker

bivouacked just in Hovey's rear on the Clinton road.  Sherman

with two divisions, was in Jackson, completing the destruction

of roads, bridges and military factories.  I rode in person out

to Clinton.  On my arrival I ordered McClernand to move early in

the morning on Edward's station, cautioning him to watch for the

enemy and not bring on an engagement unless he felt very certain

of success.



I naturally expected that Pemberton would endeavor to obey the

orders of his superior, which I have shown were to attack us at

Clinton.  This, indeed, I knew he could not do; but I felt sure

he would make the attempt to reach that point.  It turned out,

however, that he had decided his superior's plans were

impracticable, and consequently determined to move south from

Edward's station and get between me and my base.  I, however,

had no base, having abandoned it more than a week before.  On

the 15th Pemberton had actually marched south from Edward's

station, but the rains had swollen Baker's Creek, which he had

to cross so much that he could not ford it, and the bridges were

washed away.  This brought him back to the Jackson road, on which

there was a good bridge over Baker's Creek.  Some of his troops

were marching until midnight to get there.  Receiving here early

on the 16th a repetition of his order to join Johnston at

Clinton, he concluded to obey, and sent a dispatch to his chief,

informing him of the route by which he might be expected.



About five o'clock in the morning (16th) two men, who had been

employed on the Jackson and Vicksburg railroad, were brought to

me.  They reported that they had passed through Pemberton's army

in the night, and that it was still marching east. They reported

him to have eighty regiments of infantry and ten batteries; in

all, about twenty-five thousand men.



I had expected to leave Sherman at Jackson another day in order

to complete his work; but getting the above information I sent

him orders to move with all dispatch to Bolton, and to put one

division with an ammunition train on the road at once, with

directions to its commander to march with all possible speed

until he came up to our rear.  Within an hour after receiving

this order Steele's division was on the road.  At the same time

I dispatched to Blair, who was near Auburn, to move with all

speed to Edward's station.  McClernand was directed to embrace

Blair in his command for the present.  Blair's division was a

part of the 15th army corps (Sherman's); but as it was on its

way to join its corps, it naturally struck our left first, now

that we had faced about and were moving west. The 15th corps,

when it got up, would be on our extreme right.  McPherson was

directed to get his trains out of the way of the troops, and to

follow Hovey's division as closely as possible.  McClernand had

two roads about three miles apart, converging at Edward's

station, over which to march his troops.  Hovey's division of

his corps had the advance on a third road (the Clinton) still

farther north.  McClernand was directed to move Blair's and A.

J. Smith's divisions by the southernmost of these roads, and

Osterhaus and Carr by the middle road.  Orders were to move

cautiously with skirmishers to the front to feel for the enemy.



Smith's division on the most southern road was the first to

encounter the enemy's pickets, who were speedily driven in.

Osterhaus, on the middle road, hearing the firing, pushed his

skirmishers forward, found the enemy's pickets and forced them

back to the main line.  About the same time Hovey encountered

the enemy on the northern or direct wagon road from Jackson to

Vicksburg.  McPherson was hastening up to join Hovey, but was

embarrassed by Hovey's trains occupying the roads.  I was still

back at Clinton.  McPherson sent me word of the situation, and

expressed the wish that I was up.  By half-past seven I was on

the road and proceeded rapidly to the front, ordering all trains

that were in front of troops off the road.  When I arrived

Hovey's skirmishing amounted almost to a battle.



McClernand was in person on the middle road and had a shorter

distance to march to reach the enemy's position than

McPherson.  I sent him word by a staff officer to push forward

and attack.  These orders were repeated several times without

apparently expediting McClernand's advance.



Champion's Hill, where Pemberton had chosen his position to

receive us, whether taken by accident or design, was well

selected.  It is one of the highest points in that section, and

commanded all the ground in range.  On the east side of the

ridge, which is quite precipitous, is a ravine running first

north, then westerly, terminating at Baker's Creek.  It was

grown up thickly with large trees and undergrowth, making it

difficult to penetrate with troops, even when not defended.  The

ridge occupied by the enemy terminated abruptly where the ravine

turns westerly.  The left of the enemy occupied the north end of

this ridge.  The Bolton and Edward's station wagon-road turns

almost due south at this point and ascends the ridge, which it

follows for about a mile; then turning west, descends by a

gentle declivity to Baker's Creek, nearly a mile away.  On the

west side the slope of the ridge is gradual and is cultivated

from near the summit to the creek.  There was, when we were

there, a narrow belt of timber near the summit west of the road.



From Raymond there is a direct road to Edward's station, some

three miles west of Champion's Hill.  There is one also to

Bolton.  From this latter road there is still another, leaving

it about three and a half miles before reaching Bolton and leads

direct to the same station.  It was along these two roads that

three divisions of McClernand's corps, and Blair of Sherman's,

temporarily under McClernand, were moving.  Hovey of

McClernand's command was with McPherson, farther north on the

road from Bolton direct to Edward's station.  The middle road

comes into the northern road at the point where the latter turns

to the west and descends to Baker's Creek; the southern road is

still several miles south and does not intersect the others

until it reaches Edward's station.  Pemberton's lines covered

all these roads, and faced east. Hovey's line, when it first

drove in the enemy's pickets, was formed parallel to that of the

enemy and confronted his left.



By eleven o'clock the skirmishing had grown into a

hard-contested battle.  Hovey alone, before other troops could

be got to assist him, had captured a battery of the enemy.  But

he was not able to hold his position and had to abandon the

artillery.  McPherson brought up his troops as fast as possible,

Logan in front, and posted them on the right of Hovey and across

the flank of the enemy.  Logan reinforced Hovey with one brigade

from his division; with his other two he moved farther west to

make room for Crocker, who was coming up as rapidly as the roads

would admit.  Hovey was still being heavily pressed, and was

calling on me for more reinforcements.  I ordered Crocker, who

was now coming up, to send one brigade from his division.

McPherson ordered two batteries to be stationed where they

nearly enfiladed the enemy's line, and they did good execution.



From Logan's position now a direct forward movement carried him

over open fields, in rear of the enemy and in a line parallel

with them.  He did make exactly this move, attacking, however,

the enemy through the belt of woods covering the west slope of

the hill for a short distance.  Up to this time I had kept my

position near Hovey where we were the most heavily pressed; but

about noon I moved with a part of my staff by our right around,

until I came up with Logan himself.  I found him near the road

leading down to Baker's Creek.  He was actually in command of

the only road over which the enemy could retreat; Hovey,

reinforced by two brigades from McPherson's command, confronted

the enemy's left; Crocker, with two brigades, covered their left

flank; McClernand two hours before, had been within two miles and

a half of their centre with two divisions, and the two divisions,

Blair's and A. J. Smith's, were confronting the rebel right;

Ransom, with a brigade of McArthur's division of the 17th corps

(McPherson's), had crossed the river at Grand Gulf a few days

before, and was coming up on their right flank.  Neither Logan

nor I knew that we had cut off the retreat of the enemy.  Just

at this juncture a messenger came from Hovey, asking for more

reinforcements.  There were none to spare.  I then gave an order

to move McPherson's command by the left flank around to Hovey.

This uncovered the rebel line of retreat, which was soon taken

advantage of by the enemy.



During all this time, Hovey, reinforced as he was by a brigade

from Logan and another from Crocker, and by Crocker gallantly

coming up with two other brigades on his right, had made several

assaults, the last one about the time the road was opened to the

rear.  The enemy fled precipitately.  This was between three and

four o'clock.  I rode forward, or rather back, to where the

middle road intersects the north road, and found the skirmishers

of Carr's division just coming in.  Osterhaus was farther south

and soon after came up with skirmishers advanced in like

manner.  Hovey's division, and McPherson's two divisions with

him, had marched and fought from early dawn, and were not in the

best condition to follow the retreating foe.  I sent orders to

Osterhaus to pursue the enemy, and to Carr, whom I saw

personally, I explained the situation and directed him to pursue

vigorously as far as the Big Black, and to cross it if he could;

Osterhaus to follow him.  The pursuit was continued until after

dark.



The battle of Champion's Hill lasted about four hours, hard

fighting, preceded by two or three hours of skirmishing, some of

which almost rose to the dignity of battle.  Every man of Hovey's

division and of McPherson's two divisions was engaged during the

battle.  No other part of my command was engaged at all, except

that as described before.  Osterhaus's and A. J. Smith's

divisions had encountered the rebel advanced pickets as early as

half-past seven.  Their positions were admirable for advancing

upon the enemy's line.  McClernand, with two divisions, was

within a few miles of the battle-field long before noon and in

easy hearing.  I sent him repeated orders by staff officers

fully competent to explain to him the situation.  These

traversed the wood separating us, without escort, and directed

him to push forward; but he did not come.  It is true, in front

of McClernand there was a small force of the enemy and posted in

a good position behind a ravine obstructing his advance; but if

he had moved to the right by the road my staff officers had

followed the enemy must either have fallen back or been cut

off.  Instead of this he sent orders to Hovey, who belonged to

his corps, to join on to his right flank.  Hovey was bearing the

brunt of the battle at the time.  To obey the order he would have

had to pull out from the front of the enemy and march back as far

as McClernand had to advance to get into battle and substantially

over the same ground.  Of course I did not permit Hovey to obey

the order of his intermediate superior.



We had in this battle about 15,000 men absolutely engaged.  This

excludes those that did not get up, all of McClernand's command

except Hovey.  Our loss was 410 killed, 1,844 wounded and 187

missing.  Hovey alone lost 1,200 killed, wounded and

missing--more than one-third of his division.



Had McClernand come up with reasonable promptness, or had I

known the ground as I did afterwards, I cannot see how Pemberton

could have escaped with any organized force.  As it was he lost

over three thousand killed and wounded and about three thousand

captured in battle and in pursuit.  Loring's division, which was

the right of Pemberton's line, was cut off from the retreating

army and never got back into Vicksburg.  Pemberton himself fell

back that night to the Big Black River.  His troops did not stop

before midnight and many of them left before the general retreat

commenced, and no doubt a good part of them returned to their

homes.  Logan alone captured 1,300 prisoners and eleven guns.

Hovey captured 300 under fire and about 700 in all, exclusive of

500 sick and wounded whom he paroled, thus making 1,200.



McPherson joined in the advance as soon as his men could fill

their cartridge-boxes, leaving one brigade to guard our

wounded.  The pursuit was continued as long as it was light

enough to see the road.  The night of the 16th of May found

McPherson's command bivouacked from two to six miles west of the

battlefield, along the line of the road to Vicksburg.  Carr and

Osterhaus were at Edward's station, and Blair was about three

miles south-east; Hovey remained on the field where his troops

had fought so bravely and bled so freely.  Much war material

abandoned by the enemy was picked up on the battle-field, among

it thirty pieces of artillery.  I pushed through the advancing

column with my staff and kept in advance until after night.

Finding ourselves alone we stopped and took possession of a

vacant house.  As no troops came up we moved back a mile or more

until we met the head of the column just going into bivouac on

the road.  We had no tents, so we occupied the porch of a house

which had been taken for a rebel hospital and which was filled

with wounded and dying who had been brought from the

battle-field we had just left.



While a battle is raging one can see his enemy mowed down by the

thousand, or the ten thousand, with great composure; but after

the battle these scenes are distressing, and one is naturally

disposed to do as much to alleviate the suffering of an enemy as

a friend.
