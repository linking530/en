ADVANCE OF VAN DORN AND PRICE--PRICE ENTERS IUKA--BATTLE OF IUKA.



At this time, September 4th, I had two divisions of the Army of

the Mississippi stationed at Corinth, Rienzi, Jacinto and

Danville.  There were at Corinth also Davies' division and two

brigades of McArthur's, besides cavalry and artillery.  This

force constituted my left wing, of which Rosecrans was in

command.  General Ord commanded the centre, from Bethel to

Humboldt on the Mobile and Ohio railroad and from Jackson to

Bolivar where the Mississippi Central is crossed by the Hatchie

River.  General Sherman commanded on the right at Memphis with

two of his brigades back at Brownsville, at the crossing of the

Hatchie River by the Memphis and Ohio railroad.  This made the

most convenient arrangement I could devise for concentrating all

my spare forces upon any threatened point.  All the troops of the

command were within telegraphic communication of each other,

except those under Sherman.  By bringing a portion of his

command to Brownsville, from which point there was a railroad

and telegraph back to Memphis, communication could be had with

that part of my command within a few hours by the use of

couriers.  In case it became necessary to reinforce Corinth, by

this arrangement all the troops at Bolivar, except a small

guard, could be sent by rail by the way of Jackson in less than

twenty-four hours; while the troops from Brownsville could march

up to Bolivar to take their place.



On the 7th of September I learned of the advance of Van Dorn and

Price, apparently upon Corinth.  One division was brought from

Memphis to Bolivar to meet any emergency that might arise from

this move of the enemy.  I was much concerned because my first

duty, after holding the territory acquired within my command,

was to prevent further reinforcing of Bragg in Middle

Tennessee.  Already the Army of Northern Virginia had defeated

the army under General Pope and was invading Maryland.  In the

Centre General Buell was on his way to Louisville and Bragg

marching parallel to him with a large Confederate force for the

Ohio River.



I had been constantly called upon to reinforce Buell until at

this time my entire force numbered less than 50,000 men, of all

arms.  This included everything from Cairo south within my

jurisdiction.  If I too should be driven back, the Ohio River

would become the line dividing the belligerents west of the

Alleghanies, while at the East the line was already farther

north than when hostilities commenced at the opening of the

war.  It is true Nashville was never given up after its first

capture, but it would have been isolated and the garrison there

would have been obliged to beat a hasty retreat if the troops in

West Tennessee had been compelled to fall back.  To say at the

end of the second year of the war the line dividing the

contestants at the East was pushed north of Maryland, a State

that had not seceded, and at the West beyond Kentucky, another

State which had been always loyal, would have been discouraging

indeed.  As it was, many loyal people despaired in the fall of

1862 of ever saving the Union.  The administration at Washington

was much concerned for the safety of the cause it held so dear.

But I believe there was never a day when the President did not

think that, in some way or other, a cause so just as ours would

come out triumphant.



Up to the 11th of September Rosecrans still had troops on the

railroad east of Corinth, but they had all been ordered in.  By

the 12th all were in except a small force under Colonel Murphy

of the 8th Wisconsin.  He had been detained to guard the

remainder of the stores which had not yet been brought in to

Corinth.



On the 13th of September General Sterling Price entered Iuka, a

town about twenty miles east of Corinth on the Memphis and

Charleston railroad.  Colonel Murphy with a few men was guarding

the place.  He made no resistance, but evacuated the town on the

approach of the enemy.  I was apprehensive lest the object of

the rebels might be to get troops into Tennessee to reinforce

Bragg, as it was afterwards ascertained to be.  The authorities

at Washington, including the general-in-chief of the army, were

very anxious, as I have said, about affairs both in East and

Middle Tennessee; and my anxiety was quite as great on their

account as for any danger threatening my command.  I had not

force enough at Corinth to attack Price even by stripping

everything; and there was danger that before troops could be got

from other points he might be far on his way across the

Tennessee.  To prevent this all spare forces at Bolivar and

Jackson were ordered to Corinth, and cars were concentrated at

Jackson for their transportation.  Within twenty-four hours from

the transmission of the order the troops were at their

destination, although there had been a delay of four hours

resulting from the forward train getting off the track and

stopping all the others.  This gave a reinforcement of near

8,000 men, General Ord in command.  General Rosecrans commanded

the district of Corinth with a movable force of about 9,000

independent of the garrison deemed necessary to be left

behind.  It was known that General Van Dorn was about a four

days' march south of us, with a large force.  It might have been

part of his plan to attack at Corinth, Price coming from the east

while he came up from the south.  My desire was to attack Price

before Van Dorn could reach Corinth or go to his relief.



General Rosecrans had previously had his headquarters at Iuka,

where his command was spread out along the Memphis and

Charleston railroad eastward.  While there he had a most

excellent map prepared showing all the roads and streams in the

surrounding country.  He was also personally familiar with the

ground, so that I deferred very much to him in my plans for the

approach.  We had cars enough to transport all of General Ord's

command, which was to go by rail to Burnsville, a point on the

road about seven miles west of Iuka.  From there his troops were

to march by the north side of the railroad and attack Price from

the north-west, while Rosecrans was to move eastward from his

position south of Corinth by way of the Jacinto road.  A small

force was to hold the Jacinto road where it turns to the

north-east, while the main force moved on the Fulton road which

comes into Iuka further east.  This plan was suggested by

Rosecrans.



Bear Creek, a few miles to the east of the Fulton road, is a

formidable obstacle to the movement of troops in the absence of

bridges, all of which, in September, 1862, had been destroyed in

that vicinity.  The Tennessee, to the north-east, not many miles

away, was also a formidable obstacle for an army followed by a

pursuing force.  Ord was on the north-west, and even if a rebel

movement had been possible in that direction it could have

brought only temporary relief, for it would have carried Price's

army to the rear of the National forces and isolated it from all

support.  It looked to me that, if Price would remain in Iuka

until we could get there, his annihilation was inevitable.



On the morning of the 18th of September General Ord moved by

rail to Burnsville, and there left the cars and moved out to

perform his part of the programme.  He was to get as near the

enemy as possible during the day and intrench himself so as to

hold his position until the next morning.  Rosecrans was to be

up by the morning of the 19th on the two roads before described,

and the attack was to be from all three quarters

simultaneously.  Troops enough were left at Jacinto and Rienzi

to detain any cavalry that Van Dorn might send out to make a

sudden dash into Corinth until I could be notified.  There was a

telegraph wire along the railroad, so there would be no delay in

communication.  I detained cars and locomotives enough at

Burnsville to transport the whole of Ord's command at once, and

if Van Dorn had moved against Corinth instead of Iuka I could

have thrown in reinforcements to the number of 7,000 or 8,000

before he could have arrived.  I remained at Burnsville with a

detachment of about 900 men from Ord's command and communicated

with my two wings by courier.  Ord met the advance of the enemy

soon after leaving Burnsville.  Quite a sharp engagement ensued,

but he drove the rebels back with considerable loss, including

one general officer killed.  He maintained his position and was

ready to attack by daylight the next morning.  I was very much

disappointed at receiving a dispatch from Rosecrans after

midnight from Jacinto, twenty-two miles from Iuka, saying that

some of his command had been delayed, and that the rear of his

column was not yet up as far as Jacinto.  He said, however, that

he would still be at Iuka by two o'clock the next day.  I did not

believe this possible because of the distance and the condition

of the roads, which was bad; besides, troops after a forced

march of twenty miles are not in a good condition for fighting

the moment they get through.  It might do in marching to relieve

a beleaguered garrison, but not to make an assault.  I

immediately sent Ord a copy of Rosecrans' dispatch and ordered

him to be in readiness to attack the moment he heard the sound

of guns to the south or south-east.  He was instructed to notify

his officers to be on the alert for any indications of battle.

During the 19th the wind blew in the wrong direction to transmit

sound either towards the point where Ord was, or to Burnsville

where I had remained.



A couple of hours before dark on the 19th Rosecrans arrived with

the head of his column at garnets, the point where the Jacinto

road to Iuka leaves the road going east.  He here turned north

without sending any troops to the Fulton road.  While still

moving in column up the Jacinto road he met a force of the enemy

and had his advance badly beaten and driven back upon the main

road.  In this short engagement his loss was considerable for

the number engaged, and one battery was taken from him.  The

wind was still blowing hard and in the wrong direction to

transmit sounds towards either Ord or me.  Neither he nor I nor

any one in either command heard a gun that was fired upon the

battle-field.  After the engagement Rosecrans sent me a dispatch

announcing the result.  This was brought by a courier.  There was

no road between Burnsville and the position then occupied by

Rosecrans and the country was impassable for a man on

horseback.  The courier bearing the message was compelled to

move west nearly to Jacinto before he found a road leading to

Burnsville.  This made it a late hour of the night before I

learned of the battle that had taken place during the

afternoon.  I at once notified Ord of the fact and ordered him

to attack early in the morning.  The next morning Rosecrans

himself renewed the attack and went into Iuka with but little

resistance.  Ord also went in according to orders, without

hearing a gun from the south of town but supposing the troops

coming from the south-west must be up by that time.  Rosecrans,

however, had put no troops upon the Fulton road, and the enemy

had taken advantage of this neglect and retreated by that road

during the night.  Word was soon brought to me that our troops

were in Iuka.  I immediately rode into town and found that the

enemy was not being pursued even by the cavalry.  I ordered

pursuit by the whole of Rosecrans' command and went on with him

a few miles in person.  He followed only a few miles after I

left him and then went into camp, and the pursuit was continued

no further.  I was disappointed at the result of the battle of

Iuka--but I had so high an opinion of General Rosecrans that I

found no fault at the time.
