<DD>
It was not merely that Margaret was known to Mr. Thornton to have spoken
falsely,--though she imagined that for this reason only was she so turned
in his opinion,--but that this falsehood of hers bore a distinct reference
in his mind to some other lover. He could not forget the fond and earnest
look that had passed between her and some other man--the attitude of familiar
confidence, if not of positive endearment. The thought of this perpetually
stung him; it was a picture before his eyes, wherever he went and whatever
he was doing. In addition to this (and he ground his teeth as he remembered
it), was the hour, dusky twilight; the place, so far away from home, and
comparatively unfrequented. His nobler self had said at first, that all
this last might be accidental, innocent, justifiable; but once allow her
right to love and be beloved (and had he any reason to deny her right?--had
not her words been severely explicit when she cast his love away from her?),
she might easily have been beguiled into a longer walk, on to a later hour
than she had anticipated. But that falsehood! which showed a fatal consciousness
of something wrong, and to be concealed, which was unlike her. He did her
that justice, though all the time it would have been a relief to believe
her utterly unworthy of his esteem. It was this that made the misery--that
he passionately loved her, and thought her, even with all her faults, more
lovely and more excellent than any other woman; yet he deemed her so attached
to some other man, so led away by her affection for him as to violate her
truthful nature. The very falsehood that stained her, was a proof how blindly
she loved another--this dark, slight, elegant, handsome man--while he himself
was rough, and stern, and strongly made. He lashed himself into an agony
of fierce jealousy. He thought of that look, that attitude!--how he would
have laid his life at her feet for such tender glances, such fond detention!
He mocked at himself, for having valued the mechanical way in which she
had protected him from the fury of the mob; now he had seen how soft and
bewitching she looked when with a man she really loved. He remembered,
point by point, the sharpness of her words--'There was not a man in all
that crowd for whom she would not have done as much, far more readily than
for him.' He shared with the mob, in her desire of averting bloodshed from
them; but this man, this hidden lover, shared with nobody; he had looks,
words, hand-cleavings, lies, concealment, all to himself.</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Thornton was conscious that he had never been so irritable as he was
now, m all his life long; he felt inclined to give a short abrupt answer,
more like a bark than a speech, to every one that asked him a question;
and this consciousness hurt his pride he had always piqued himself on his
self-control, and control himself he would. So the manner was subdued to
a quiet deliberation, but the matter was even harder and sterner than common.
He was more than usually silent at home; employing his evenings in a continual
pace backwards and forwards, which would have annoyed his mother exceedingly
if it had been practised by any one else; and did not tend to promote any
forbearance on her part even to this beloved son.</DD>

<DD>
'Can you stop--can you sit down for a moment? I have something to say to
you, if you would give up that everlasting walk, walk, walk.'</DD>

<DD>
He sat down instantly, on a chair against the wall.</DD>

<DD>
'I want to speak to you about Betsy. She says she must leave us; that her
lover's death has so affected her spirits she can't give her heart to her
work.'</DD>

<DD>
'Very well. I suppose other cooks are to be met with.'</DD>

<DD>
'That's so like a man. It's not merely the cooking, it is that she knows
all the ways of the house. Besides, she tells me something about your friend
Miss Hale.'</DD>

<DD>
'Miss Hale is no friend of mine. Mr. Hale is my friend.'</DD>

<DD>
'I am glad to hear you say so, for if she had been your friend, what Betsy
says would have annoyed you.'</DD>

<DD>
'Let me hear it,' said he, with the extreme quietness of manner he had
been assuming for the last few days.</DD>

<DD>
'Betsy says, that the night on which her lover--I forget his name--for
she always calls him "he"----'</DD>

<DD>
'Leonards.'</DD>

<DD>
'The night on which Leonards was last seen at the station--when he was
last seen on duty, in fact--Miss Hale was there, walking about with a young
man who, Betsy believes, killed Leonards by some blow or push.'</DD>

<DD>
'Leonards was not killed by any blow or push.'</DD>

<DD>
'How do you know?'</DD>

<DD>
'Because I distinctly put the question to the surgeon of the Infirmary.
He told me there was an internal disease of long standing, caused by Leonards'
habit of drinking to excess; that the fact of his becoming rapidly worse
while in a state of intoxication, settled the question as to whether the
last fatal attack was caused by excess of drinking, or the fall.'</DD>

<DD>
'The fall! What fall?'</DD>

<DD>
'Caused by the blow or push of which Betsy speaks.'</DD>

<DD>
'Then there was a blow or push?'</DD>

<DD>
'I believe so.'</DD>

<DD>
'And who did it?'</DD>

<DD>
'As there was no inquest, in consequence of the doctor's opinion, I cannot
tell you.'</DD>

<DD>
'But Miss Hale was there?'</DD>

<DD>
No answer.</DD>

<DD>
'And with a young man?'</DD>

<DD>
Still no answer. At last he said: 'I tell you, mother, that there was no
inquest--no inquiry. No judicial inquiry, I mean.'</DD>

<DD>
'Betsy says that Woolmer (some man she knows, who is in a grocer's shop
out at Crampton) can swear that Miss Hale was at the station at that hour,
walking backwards and forwards with a young man.'</DD>

<DD>
'I don't see what we have to do with that. Miss Hale is at liberty to please
herself.'</DD>

<DD>
'I'm glad to hear you say so,' said Mrs. Thornton, eagerly. 'It certainly
signifies very little to us--not at all to you, after what has passed!
but I--I made a promise to Mrs. Hale, that I would not allow her daughter
to go wrong without advising and remonstrating with her. I shall certainly
let her know my opinion of such conduct.'</DD>

<DD>
'I do not see any harm in what she did that evening,' said Mr. Thornton,
getting up, and coming near to his mother; he stood by the chimney-piece
with his face turned away from the room.</DD>

<DD>
'You would not have approved of Fanny's being seen out, after dark, in
rather a lonely place, walking about with a young man. I say nothing of
the taste which could choose the time, when her mother lay unburied, for
such a promenade. Should you have liked your sister to have been noticed
by a grocer's assistant for doing so?'</DD>

<DD>
'In the first place, as it is not many years since I myself was a draper's
assistant, the mere circumstance of a grocer's assistant noticing any act
does not alter the character of the act to me. And in the next place, I
see a great deal of difference between Miss Hale and Fanny. I can imagine
that the one may have weighty reasons, which may and ought to make her
overlook any seeming Impropriety in her conduct. I never knew Fanny have
weighty reasons for anything. Other people must guard her. I believe Miss
Hale is a guardian to herself'</DD>

<DD>
'A pretty character of your sister, indeed! Really, John, one would have
thought Miss Hale had done enough to make you clear-sighted. She drew you
on to an offer, by a bold display of pretended regard for you,--to play
you off against this very young man, I've no doubt. Her whole conduct is
clear to me now. You believe he is her lover, I suppose--you agree to that.'</DD>

<DD>
He turned round to his mother; his face was very gray and grim. 'Yes, mother.
I do believe he is her lover.' When he had spoken, he turned round again;
he writhed himself about, like one in bodily pain. He leant his face against
his hand. Then before she could speak, he turned sharp again:</DD>

<DD>
'Mother. He is her lover, whoever he is; but she may need help and womanly
counsel;--there may be difficulties or temptations which I don't know.
I fear there are. I don't want to know what they are; but as you have ever
been a good--ay! and a tender mother to me, go to her, and gain her confidence,
and tell her what is best to be done. I know that something is wrong; some
dread, must be a terrible torture to her.'</DD>

<DD>
'For God's sake, John!' said his mother, now really shocked, 'what do you
mean? What do you mean? What do you know?'</DD>

<DD>
He did not reply to her.</DD>

<DD>
'John! I don't know what I shan't think unless you speak. You have no right
to say what you have done against her.'</DD>

<DD>
'Not against her, mother! I could not speak against her.'</DD>

<DD>
'Well! you have no right to say what you have done, unless you say more.
These half-expressions are what ruin a woman's character.'</DD>

<DD>
'Her character! Mother, you do not dare--' he faced about, and looked into
her face with his flaming eyes. Then, drawing himself up into determined
composure and dignity, he said, 'I will not say any more than this, which
is neither more nor less than the simple truth, and I am sure you believe
me,--I have good reason to believe, that Miss Hale is in some strait and
difficulty connected with an attachment which, of itself, from my knowledge
of Miss Hale's character, is perfectly innocent and right. What my reason
is, I refuse to tell. But never let me hear any one say a word against
her, implying any more serious imputation than that she now needs the counsel
of some kind and gentle woman. You promised Mrs. Hale to be that woman!'</DD>

<DD>
No!' said Mrs. Thornton. 'I am happy to say, I did not promise kindness
and gentleness, for I felt at the time that it might be out of my power
to render these to one of Miss Hale's character and disposition. I promised
counsel and advice, such as I would give to my own daughter; I shall speak
to her as I would do to Fanny, if she had gone gallivanting with a young
man in the dusk. I shall speak with relation to the circumstances I know,
without being influenced either one way or another by the "strong reasons"
which you will not confide to me. Then I shall have fulfilled my promise,
and done my duty.'</DD>

<DD>
'She will never bear it,' said he passionately.</DD>

<DD>
'She will have to bear it, if I speak in her dead mother's name.'</DD>

<DD>
'Well!' said he, breaking away, 'don't tell me any more about it. I cannot
endure to think of it. It will be better that you should speak to her any
way, than that she should not be spoken to at all.--Oh! that look of love!'
continued he, between his teeth, as he bolted himself into his own private
room. 'And that cursed lie; which showed some terrible shame in the background,
to be kept from the light in which I thought she lived perpetually! Oh,
Margaret, Margaret! Mother, how you have tortured me! Oh! Margaret, could
you not have loved me? I am but uncouth and hard, but I would never have
led you into any falsehood for me.'</DD>

<DD>
The more Mrs. Thornton thought over what her son had said, in pleading
for a merciful judgment for Margaret's indiscretion, the more bitterly
she felt inclined towards her. She took a savage pleasure in the idea of
'speaking her mind' to her, in the guise of fulfilment of a duty. She enjoyed
the thought of showing herself untouched by the 'glamour,' which she was
well aware Margaret had the power of throwing over many people. She snorted
scornfully over the picture of the beauty of her victim; her jet black
hair, her clear smooth skin, her lucid eyes would not help to save her
one word of the just and stern reproach which Mrs. Thornton spent half
the night in preparing to her mind.</DD>

<DD>
'Is Miss Hale within?' She knew she was, for she had seen her at the window,
and she had her feet inside the little hall before Martha had half answered
her question.</DD>

<DD>
Margaret was sitting alone, writing to Edith, and giving her many particulars
of her mother's last days. It was a softening employment, and she had to
brush away the unbidden tears as Mrs. Thornton was announced.</DD>

<DD>
She was so gentle and ladylike in her mode of reception that her visitor
was somewhat daunted; and it became impossible to utter the speech, so
easy of arrangement with no one to address it to. Margaret's low rich voice
was softer than usual; her manner more gracious, because in her heart she
was feeling very grateful to Mrs. Thornton for the courteous attention
of her call. She exerted herself to find subjects of interest for conversation;
praised Martha, the servant whom Mrs. Thornton had found for them; had
asked Edith for a little Greek air, about which she had spoken to Miss
Thornton. Mrs. Thornton was fairly discomfited. Her sharp Damascus blade
seemed out of place, and useless among rose-leaves. She was silent, because
she was trying to task herself up to her duty At last, she stung herself
into its performance by a suspicion which, in spite of all probability,
she allowed to cross her mind, that all this sweetness was put on with
a view of propitiating Mr. Thornton; that, somehow, the other attachment
had fallen through, and that it suited Miss Hale's purpose to recall her
rejected lover. Poor Margaret! there was perhaps so much truth in the suspicion
as this: that Mrs. Thornton was the mother of one whose regard she valued,
and feared to have lost; and this thought unconsciously added to her natural
desire of pleasing one who was showing her kindness by her visit. Mrs.
Thornton stood up to go, but yet she seemed to have something more to say.
She cleared her throat and began:</DD>

<DD>
'Miss Hale, I have a duty to perform. I promised your poor mother that,
as far as my poor judgment went, I would not allow you to act in any way
wrongly, or (she softened her speech down a little here) inadvertently,
without remonstrating; at least, without offering advice, whether you took
it or not.'</DD>

<DD>
Margaret stood before her, blushing like any culprit, with her eyes dilating
as she gazed at Mrs. Thornton. She thought she had come to speak to her
about the falsehood she had told--that Mr. Thornton had employed her to
explain the danger she had exposed herself to, of being confuted in full
court! and although her heart sank to think he had not rather chosen to
come himself, and upbraid her, and receive her penitence, and restore her
again to his good opinion, yet she was too much humbled not to bear any
blame on this subject patiently and meekly.</DD>

<DD>
Mrs. Thornton went on:</DD>

<DD>
'At first, when I heard from one of my servants, that you had been seen
walking about with a gentleman, so far from home as the Outwood station,
at such a time of the evening, I could hardly believe it. But my son, I
am sorry to say, confirmed her story. It was indiscreet, to say the least;
many a young woman has lost her character before now----'</DD>

<DD>
Margaret's eyes flashed fire. This was a new idea--this was too insulting.
If Mrs. Thornton had spoken to her about the lie she had told, well and
good--she would have owned it, and humiliated herself But to interfere
with her conduct--to speak of her character! she--Mrs. Thornton, a mere
stranger--it was too impertinent! She would not answer her--not one word.
Mrs. Thornton saw the battle-spirit in Margaret's eyes, and it called.
up her combativeness also.</DD>

<DD>
'For your mother's sake, I have thought it right to warn you against such
improprieties; they must degrade you in the long run in the estimation
of the world, even if in fact they do not lead you to positive harm.'</DD>

<DD>
'For my mother's sake,' said Margaret, in a tearful voice, 'I will bear
much; but I cannot bear everything. She never meant me to be exposed to
insult, I am sure.'</DD>

<DD>
'Insult, Miss Hale!'</DD>

<DD>
'Yes, madam,' said Margaret more steadily, 'it is insult. What do you know
of me that should lead you to suspect--Oh!' said she, breaking down, and
covering her face with her hands--'I know now, Mr. Thornton has told you----'</DD>

<DD>
'No, Miss Hale,' said Mrs. Thornton, her truthfulness causing her to arrest
the confession Margaret was on the point of making, though her curiosity
was itching to hear it. 'Stop. Mr. Thornton has told me nothing. You do
not know my son. You are not worthy to know him. He said this. Listen,
young lady, that you may understand, if you can, what sort of a man you
rejected. This Milton manufacturer, his great tender heart scorned as it
was scorned, said to me only last night, "Go to her. I have good reason
to know that she is in some strait, arising out of some attachment; and
she needs womanly counsel." I believe those were his very words. Farther
than that--beyond admitting the fact of your being at the Outwood station
with a gentleman, on the evening of the twenty-sixth--he has said nothing--not
one word against you. If he has knowledge of anything which should make
you sob so, he keeps it to himself.'</DD>

<DD>
Margaret's face was still hidden in her hands, the fingers of which were
wet with tears. Mrs. Thornton was a little mollified.</DD>

<DD>
'Come, Miss Hale. There may be circumstances, I'll allow, that, if explained,
may take off from the seeming impropriety.'</DD>

<DD>
Still no answer. Margaret was considering what to say; she wished to stand
well with Mrs. Thornton; and yet she could not, might not, give any explanation.
Mrs. Thornton grew impatient.</DD>

<DD>
'I shall be sorry to break off an acquaintance; but for Fanny's sake--as
I told my son, if Fanny had done so we should consider it a great disgrace--and
Fanny might be led away----'</DD>

<DD>
'I can give you no explanation,' said Margaret, in a low voice. 'I have
done wrong, but not in the way you think or know about. I think Mr. Thornton
judges me more mercifully than you;'--she had hard work to keep herself
from choking with her tears--'but, I believe, madam, you mean to do rightly.'</DD>

<DD>
'Thank you,' said Mrs. Thornton, drawing herself up; 'I was not aware that
my meaning was doubted. It is the last time I shall interfere. I was unwilling
to consent to do it, when your mother asked me. I had not approved of my
son's attachment to you, while I only suspected it. You did not appear
to me worthy of him. But when you compromised yourself as you did at the
time of the riot, and exposed yourself to the comments of servants and
workpeople, I felt it was no longer right to set myself against my son's
wish of proposing to you--a wish, by the way, which he had always denied
entertaining until the day of the riot.' Margaret winced, and drew in her
breath with a long, hissing sound; of which, however, Mrs. Thornton took
no notice. 'He came; you had apparently changed your mind. I told my son
yesterday, that I thought it possible, short as was the interval, you might
have heard or learnt something of this other lover----'</DD>

<DD>
'What must you think of me, madam?' asked Margaret, throwing her head back
with proud disdain, till her throat curved outwards like a swan's. 'You
can say nothing more, Mrs. Thornton. I decline every attempt to justify
myself for anything. You must allow me to leave the room.'</DD>

<DD>
And she swept out of it with the noiseless grace of an offended princess.
Mrs. Thornton had quite enough of natural humour to make her feel the ludicrousness
of the position in which she was left. There was nothing for it but to
show herself out. She was not particularly annoyed at Margaret's way of
behaving. She did not care enough for her for that. She had taken Mrs.
Thornton's remonstrance to the full as keenly to heart as that lady expected;
and Margaret's passion at once mollified her visitor, far more than any
silence or reserve could have done. It showed the effect of her words.
'My young lady,' thought Mrs. Thornton to herself; 'you've a pretty good
temper of your own. If John and you had come together, he would have had
to keep a tight hand over you, to make you know your place. But I don't
think you will go a-walking again with your beau, at such an hour of the
day, in a hurry. You've too much pride and spirit in you for that. I like
to see a girl fly out at the notion of being talked about. It shows they're
neither giddy, nor hold by nature. As for that girl, she might be hold,
but she'd never be giddy. I'll do her that justice. Now as to Fanny, she'd
be giddy, and not bold. She's no courage in her, poor thing!'</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Thornton was not spending the morning so satisfactorily as his mother.
She, at any rate, was fulfilling her determined purpose. He was trying
to understand where he stood; what damage the strike had done him. A good
deal of his capital was locked up in new and expensive machinery; and he
had also bought cotton largely, with a view to some great orders which
he had in hand. The strike had thrown him terribly behindhand, as to the
completion of these orders. Even with his own accustomed and skilled workpeople,
he would have had some difficulty in fulfilling his engagements; as it
was, the incompetence of the Irish hands, who had to be trained to their
work, at a time requiring unusual activity, was a daily annoyance.</DD>

<DD>
It was not a favourable hour for Higgins to make his request. But he had
promised Margaret to do it at any cost. So, though every moment added to
his repugnance, his pride, and his sullenness of temper, he stood leaning
against the dead wall, hour after hour, first on one leg, then on the other.
At last the latch was sharply lifted, and out came Mr. Thornton.</DD>

<DD>
'I want for to speak to yo', sir.'</DD>

<DD>
'Can't stay now, my man. I'm too late as it is.'</DD>

<DD>
'Well, sir, I reckon I can wait till yo' come back.'</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Thornton was half way down the street. Higgins sighed. But it was no
use. To catch him in the street was his only chance of seeing 'the measter;'
if he had rung the lodge bell, or even gone up to the house to ask for
him, he would have been referred to the overlooker. So he stood still again,
vouchsafing no answer, but a short nod of recognition to the few men who
knew and spoke to him, as the crowd drove out of the millyard at dinner-time,
and scowling with all his might at the Irish 'knobsticks' who had just
been imported. At last Mr. Thornton returned.</DD>

<DD>
'What! you there still!'</DD>

<DD>
'Ay, sir. I mun speak to yo'.'</DD>

<DD>
'Come in here, then. Stay, we'll go across the yard; the men are not come
back, and we shall have it to ourselves. These good people, I see, are
at dinner;' said he, closing the door of the porter's lodge.</DD>

<DD>
He stopped to speak to the overlooker. The latter said in a low tone:</DD>

<DD>
'I suppose you know, sir, that that man is Higgins, one of the leaders
of the Union; he that made that speech in Hurstfield.'</DD>

<DD>
'No, I didn't,' said Mr. Thornton, looking round sharply at his follower.
Higgins was known to him by name as a turbulent spirit.</DD>

<DD>
'Come along,' said he, and his tone was rougher than before. 'It is men
such as this,' thought he, 'who interrupt commerce and injure the very
town they live in: mere demagogues, lovers of power, at whatever cost to
others.'</DD>

<DD>
'Well, sir! what do you want with me?' said Mr. Thornton, facing round
at him, as soon as they were in the counting-house of the mill.</DD>

<DD>
'My name is Higgins'--</DD>

<DD>
'I know that,' broke in Mr. Thornton. 'What do you want, Mr. Higgins? That's
the question.'</DD>

<DD>
'I want work.'</DD>

<DD>
'Work! You're a pretty chap to come asking me for work. You don't want
impudence, that's very clear.'</DD>

<DD>
'I've getten enemies and backbiters, like my betters; but I ne'er heerd
o' ony of them calling me o'er-modest,' said Higgins. His blood was a little
roused by Mr. Thornton's manner, more than by his words.</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Thornton saw a letter addressed to himself on the table. He took it
up and read it through. At the end, he looked up and said, 'What are you
waiting for?'</DD>

<DD>
'An answer to the question I axed.'</DD>

<DD>
'I gave it you before. Don't waste any more of your time.'</DD>

<DD>
'Yo' made a remark, sir, on my impudence: but I were taught that it was
manners to say either "yes" or "no," when I were axed a civil question.
I should be thankfu' to yo' if yo'd give me work. Hamper will speak to
my being a good hand.'</DD>

<DD>
'I've a notion you'd better not send me to Hamper to ask for a character,
my man. I might hear more than you'd like.'</DD>

<DD>
'I'd take th' risk. Worst they could say of me is, that I did what I thought
best, even to my own wrong.'</DD>

<DD>
'You'd better go and try them, then, and see whether they'll give you work.
I've turned off upwards of a hundred of my best hands, for no other fault
than following you and such as you; and d'ye think I'll take you on? I
might as well put a firebrand into the midst of the cotton-waste.'</DD>

<DD>
Higgins turned away; then the recollection of Boucher came over him, and
he faced round with the greatest concession he could persuade himself to
make.</DD>

<DD>
'I'd promise yo', measter, I'd not speak a word as could do harm, if so
be yo' did right by us; and I'd promise more: I'd promise that when I seed
yo' going wrong, and acting unfair, I'd speak to yo' in private first;
and that would be a fair warning. If yo' and I did na agree in our opinion
o' your conduct, yo' might turn me off at an hour's notice.'</DD>

'Upon my word, you don't think small beer of yourself! Hamper has had a
loss of you. How came he to let you and your wisdom go?'</DD>

<DD>
'Well, we parted wi' mutual dissatisfaction. I wouldn't gi'e the pledge
they were asking; and they wouldn't have me at no rate. So I'm free to
make another engagement; and as I said before, though I should na' say
it, I'm a good hand, measter, and a steady man--specially when I can keep
fro' drink; and that I shall do now, if I ne'er did afore.'</DD>

<DD>
'That you may have more money laid up for another strike, I suppose?'</DD>

<DD>
'No! I'd be thankful if I was free to do that; it's for to keep th' widow
and childer of a man who was drove mad by them knobsticks o' yourn; put
out of his place by a Paddy that did na know weft fro' warp.'</DD>

<DD>
'Well! you'd better turn to something else, if you've any such good intention
in your head. I shouldn't advise you to stay in Milton: you're too well
known here.'</DD>

<DD>
'If it were summer,' said Higgins, 'I'd take to Paddy's work, and go as
a navvy, or haymaking, or summut, and ne'er see Milton again. But it's
winter, and th' childer will clem.'</DD>

<DD>
'A pretty navvy you'd make! why, you couldn't do half a day's work at digging
against an Irishman.'</DD>

<DD>
'I'd only charge half-a-day for th' twelve hours, if I could only do half-a-day's
work in th' time. Yo're not knowing of any place, where they could gi'
me a trial, away fro' the mills, if I'm such a firebrand? I'd take any
wage they thought I was worth, for the sake of those childer.'</DD>

<DD>
'Don't you see what you would be? You'd be a knobstick. You'd be taking
less wages than the other labourers--all for the sake of another man's
children. Think how you'd abuse any poor fellow who was willing to take
what he could get to keep his own children. You and your Union would soon
be down upon him. No! no! if it's only for the recollection of the way
in which you've used the poor knobsticks before now, I say No! to your
question. I'll not give you work. I won't say, I don't believe your pretext
for coming and asking for work; I know nothing about it. It may be true,
or it may not. It's a very unlikely story, at any rate. Let me pass. I'll
not give you work. There's your answer.'</DD>

<DD>
'I hear, sir. I would na ha' troubled yo', but that I were bid to come,
by one as seemed to think yo'd getten some soft place in, yo'r heart. Hoo
were mistook, and I were misled. But I'm not the first man as is misled
by a woman.'</DD>

<DD>
'Tell her to mind her own business the next time, instead of taking up
your time and mine too. I believe women are at the bottom of every plague
in this world. Be off with you.'</DD>

<DD>
'I'm obleeged to yo' for a' yo'r kindness, measter, and most of a' for
yo'r civil way o' saying good-bye.'</DD>

Mr. Thornton did not deign a reply. But, looking out of the window a minute
after, he was struck with the lean, bent figure going out of the yard:
the heavy walk was in strange contrast with the resolute, clear determination
of the man to speak to him. He crossed to the porter's lodge:</DD>

<DD>
'How long has that man Higgins been waiting to speak to me?'</DD>

<DD>
'He was outside the gate before eight o'clock, sir. I think he's been there
ever since.'</DD>

<DD>
'And it is now--?'</DD>

<DD>
'Just one, sir.'</DD>

<DD>
'Five hours,' thought Mr. Thornton; 'it's a long time for a man to wait,
doing nothing but first hoping and then fearing.'</DD>
