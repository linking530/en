<DD>
For some days after the ball Cynthia seemed languid, and was very silent.
Molly, who had promised herself fully as much enjoyment in talking over
the past gaiety with Cynthia as in the evening itself, was disappointed
when she found that all conversation on the subject was rather evaded than
encouraged. Mrs Gibson, it is true, was ready to go over the ground as
many times as any one liked; but her words were always like ready-made
clothes, and never fitted individual thoughts. Anybody might have used
them, and, with a change of proper names, they might have served to describe
any ball. She repeatedly used the same language in speaking about it, till
Molly knew the sentences and their sequence even to irritation.</DD>

<DD>
'Ah! Mr Osborne, you should have been there! I said to myself many a time
how you really should have been there - you and, your brother of course.'</DD>

<DD>
'I thought of you very often during the evening!'</DD>

<DD>
'Did you? Now that I call very kind of you. Cynthia, darling! Do you hear
what Mr Osborne Hamley was saying?' as Cynthia came into the room just
then. 'He thought of us all on the evening of the ball.'</DD>

<DD>
'He did better than merely remember us then,' said Cynthia, with her soft
slow smile. 'We owe him thanks for those beautiful flowers, mamma.'</DD>

<DD>
'Oh!' said Osborne, 'you must not thank me exclusively. I believe it was
my thought, but Roger took all the trouble of it.'</DD>

<DD>
'I consider the thought as everything,' said Mrs Gibson. 'Thought is spiritual,
while action is merely material.'</DD>

<DD>
This fine sentence took the speaker herself by surprise; and in such conversation
as was then going on, it is not necessary to accurately define the meaning
of everything that is said.</DD>

<DD>
'I'm afraid the flowers were too late to be of much use though,' continued
Osborne. 'I met Preston the next morning, and of course we talked about
the ball. I was sorry to find he had been beforehand with us,'</DD>

<DD>
'He only sent one nosegay, and that was for Cynthia,' said Molly, looking
up from her work. 'And it did not come till after we had received the flowers
from Hamley.' Molly caught a sight of Cynthia's face before she bent down
again to her sewing. It was scarlet in colour, and there was a flash of
anger in her eyes. Both she and her mother hastened to speak as soon as
Molly had finished, but Cynthia's voice was choked with passion, and Mrs
Gibson had the word.</DD>

<DD>
'Mr Preston's bouquet was just one of those formal affairs any one can
buy at a nursery-garden, which always strike me as having no sentiment
in them. I would far rather have two or three lilies of the valley gathered
for me by a person I like, than the most expensive bouquet that could be
bought!'</DD>

<DD>
'Mr Preston had no business to speak as if he had forestalled you,' said
Cynthia. 'It came just as we were ready to go, and I put it into the fire
directly.'</DD>

<DD>
'Cynthia, my dear love!' said Mrs Gibson (who had never heard of the fate
of the flowers until now), 'what an idea of yourself you will give to Mr
Osborne Hamley; but to be sure, I can quite understand it. You inherit
my feeling - my prejudice - sentimental I grant, against bought flowers.'</DD>

<DD>
Cynthia was silent for a moment; then she said, 'I used some of your flowers,
Mr Hamley, to dress Molly's hair. It was a great temptation, for the colour
so exactly matched her coral ornaments; but I believe she thought it treacherous
to disturb the arrangement, so I ought to take all the blame on myself.'</DD>

<DD>
'The arrangement was my brother's, as I told you; but I am sure he would
have preferred seeing them in Miss Gibson's hair rather than in the blazing
fire. Mr Preston comes far the worst off.' Osborne was rather amused at
the whole affair, and would have liked to probe Cynthia's motives a little
farther. He did not hear Molly saying in as soft a voice as if she were
talking to herself, 'I wore mine just as they were sent,' for Mrs Gibson
came in with a total change of subject.</DD>

<DD>
'Speaking of lilies of the valley, is it true that they grow wild in Hurst
Wood? It is not the season for them to be in flower yet; but when it is,
I think we must take a walk there - with our luncheon in a basket - a little
picnic in fact. You'll join us, won't you?' turning to Osborne. 'I think
it's a charming plan! You could ride to Hollingford and put up your horse
here, and we would have a long day in the woods and all come home to dinner
- dinner with a basket of lilies in the middle of the table!'</DD>

<DD>
'I should like it very much,' said Osborne; 'but I may not be at home.
Roger is more likely to be here, I believe, at that time - a month hence.'
He was thinking of the visit to London to sell his poems, and the run down
to Winchester which he anticipated afterwards - the end of May had been
the period fixed for this pleasure for some time, not merely in his own
mind, but in writing to his wife.</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, but you must be with us! We must wait for Mr Osborne Hamley, must
not we, Cynthia?'</DD>

<DD>
'I'm afraid the lilies won't wait,' replied Cynthia.</DD>

<DD>
'Well, then, we must put it off till dog-rose and honeysuckle time. You
will be at home then, won't you? or does the London season present too
many attractions?'</DD>

<DD>
'I don't exactly know when dog-roses are in flower!'</DD>

<DD>
'Not know, and you a poet? Don't you remember the lines -</DD>

<DD>
It was the time of roses,</DD>

<DD>
We plucked them as we passed?"</DD>

<DD>
'Yes; but that doesn't specify the time of year that is the time of roses;
and I believe my movements are guided more by the lunar calendar than the
floral. You had better take my brother for your companion; he is practical
in his love of flowers, I am only theoretical.'</DD>

<DD>
'Does that fine word "theoretical" imply that you are ignorant?' asked
Cynthia.</DD>

<DD>
'Of course we shall be happy to see your brother; but why can't we have
you too? I confess to a little timidity in the presence of one so deep
and learned as your brother is from all accounts. Give me a little charming
ignorance, if we must call it by that hard word.'</DD>

<DD>
Osborne bowed. It was very pleasant to him to be petted and flattered,
even though he knew all the time that it was only flattery. It was an agreeable
contrast to the home that was so dismal to him, to come to this house where
the society of two agreeable girls, and the soothing syrup of their mother's
speeches, awaited him whenever he liked to come. To say nothing of the
difference that struck upon his senses, poetical though he might esteem
himself, of a sitting-room full of flowers and tokens of women's presence,
where all the chairs were easy, and all the tables well covered with pretty
things, to the great drawing-room at home, where the draperies were threadbare,
and the seats uncomfortable, and no sign of feminine presence ever now
lent a grace to the stiff arrangement of the furniture. Then the meals,
light and well cooked, suited his taste and delicate appetite so much better
than the rich and heavy viands prepared by the servants at the Hall. Osborne
was becoming a little afraid of falling into the habit of paying too frequent
visits to the Gibsons (and that, not because he feared the consequences
of his intercourse with the two young ladies; for he never thought of them
excepting as friends; - the fact of his marriage was constantly present
to his mind, and Aim&eacute;e too securely enthroned in his heart, for
him to remember that he might be looked upon by others in the light of
a possible husband); but the reflection forced itself upon him occasionally,
whether he was not trespassing too often on hospitality which he had at
present no means of returning.</DD>

<DD>
But Mrs Gibson, in her ignorance of the true state of affairs, was secretly
exultant in the attraction which made him come so often and lounge away
the hours in their house and garden. She had no doubt that it was Cynthia
who drew him to the house; and if the latter had been a little more amenable
to reason, her mother would have made more frequent allusions than she
did to the crisis which she thought was approaching. But she was restrained
by the intuitive conviction that if her daughter became conscious of what
was impending, and was made aware of Mrs Gibson's cautious and quiet efforts
to forward the catastrophe, the wilful girl would oppose herself to it
with all her skill and power. As it was, Mrs Gibson trusted that Cynthia's
affections would become engaged before she knew where she was, and that
in that case she would not attempt to frustrate her mother's delicate scheming,
even though she did perceive it. But Cynthia had come across too many varieties
of flirtation, admiration, and even passionate love, to be for a moment
at fault as to the quiet friendly nature of Osborne's attentions. She received
him always as a sister might a brother. It was different when Roger returned
from his election as Fellow of Trinity. The trembling diffidence, the hardly
suppressed ardour of his manner, made Cynthia understand before long with
what kind of love she had now to deal. She did not put it into so many
words - no, not even in her secret heart - but she recognized the difference
between Roger's relation to her and Osborne's, long before Mrs Gibson found
it out. Molly was, however, the first to discover the nature of Roger's
attraction. The first time they saw him after the ball, it came out to
her observant eyes. Cynthia had not been looking well since that evening;
she went slowly about the house, pale and heavy-eyed; and, fond as she
usually was of exercise and the free fresh air, there was hardly any persuading
her now to go out for a walk. Molly watched this fading with tender anxiety,
but to all her questions as to whether she had felt over-fatigued with
her dancing, whether anything had occurred to annoy her, and all such inquiries,
she replied in languid negatives. Once Molly touched on Mr Preston's name,
and found that this was a subject on which Cynthia was raw; now, Cynthia's
face lighted up with spirit, and her whole body showed her ill-repressed
agitation, but she only said a few sharp words, expressive of anything
but kindly feeling towards the gentleman, and then bade Molly never name
his name to her again. Still, the latter could not imagine that he was
more than intensely distasteful to her friend, as well as to herself, he
could not be the cause of Cynthia's present indisposition. But this indisposition
lasted so many days without change or modification, that even Mrs Gibson
noticed it, and Molly became positively uneasy. Mrs Gibson considered Cynthia's
quietness and languor as the natural consequence of 'dancing with everybody
who asked her' at the ball. Partners whose names were in the 'Red Book'
would not have produced half the amount of fatigue, according to Mrs Gibson's
judgment apparently, and if Cynthia had been quite well, very probably
she would have hit the blot in her mother's speech with one of her touches
of sarcasm. Then, again, when Cynthia did not rally, Mrs Gibson grew impatient,
and accused her of being fanciful and lazy; at length, and partly at Molly's
instance, there came an appeal to Mr Gibson, and a professional examination
of the supposed invalid, which Cynthia hated more than anything, especially
when the verdict was, that there was nothing very much the matter, only
a general lowness of tone, and depression of health and spirits, which
would soon be remedied by tonics, and, meanwhile, she was not to be urged
to exertion.</DD>

<DD>
'If there is one thing I dislike,' said Cynthia to Mr Gibson, after he
had pronounced tonics to be the cure for her present state, 'it is the
way doctors have of giving tablespoonfuls of nauseous mixtures as a certain
remedy for sorrows and cares.' She laughed up in his face as she spoke;
she had always a pretty word and smile for him, even in the midst of her
loss of spirits.</DD>

<DD>
'Come! you acknowledge you have "sorrows" by that speech; we'll make a
bargain: if you'll tell me your sorrows and cares, I'll try and find some
other remedy for them than giving you what you are pleased to term my nauseous
mixtures.'</DD>

<DD>
'No,' said Cynthia, colouring; 'I never said I had sorrows and cares; I
spoke generally. What should I have a sorrow about - you and Molly are
only too kind to me,' her eyes filling with tears.</DD>

<DD>
'Well, well, we'll not talk of such gloomy things, and you shall have some
sweet emulsion to disguise the taste of the bitters I shall be obliged
to fall back upon.'</DD>

<DD>
'Please, don't. If you but knew how I dislike emulsions and disguises!
I do want bitters - and if I sometimes - if I'm obliged to - if I'm not
truthful myself, I do like truth in others - at least, sometimes.' She
ended her sentence with another smile, bus it was rather faint and watery.</DD>

<DD>
Now the first person out of the house to notice Cynthia's change of look
and manner was Roger Hamley - and yet he did not see her until, under the
influence of the nauseous mixture, she was beginning to recover. But his
eyes were scarcely off her during the first five minutes he was in the
room. All the time he was trying to talk to Mrs Gibson in reply to her
civil platitudes, he was studying Cynthia; and at the first convenient
pause he came and stood before Molly, so as to interpose his person between
her and the rest of the room; for some visitors had come in subsequent
to his entrance.</DD>

<DD>
'Molly, how ill your sister is looking! What is it? Has she had advice?
You must forgive me, but so often those who live together in the same house
don't observe the first approaches of illness.'</DD>

<DD>
Now Molly's love for Cynthia was fast and unwavering, but if anything tried
it, it was the habit Roger had fallen into of always calling Cynthia Molly's
sister in speaking to the latter. From any one else it would have been
a matter of indifference to her, and hardly to be noticed; it vexed both
ear and heart when Roger used the expression; and there was a curtness
of manner as well as of words in her reply.</DD>

<DD>
'Oh! she was over-tired by the ball. Papa has seen her, and says she will
be all right very soon.'</DD>

<DD>
'I wonder if she wants change of air?' said Roger, meditatively. 'I wish
- I do wish we could have her at the Hall; you and your mother too, of
course. But I don't see how it would be possible - or else how charming
it would be!'</DD>

<DD>
Molly felt as if a visit to the Hall under such circumstances would be
altogether so different an affair to all her former ones, that she could
hardly tell if she should like it or not.</DD>

<DD>
Roger went on, -</DD>

<DD>
'You got our flowers in time, did you not? Ah! you don't know how often
I thought of you that evening! And you enjoyed it too, didn't you? - you
had plenty of agreeable partners, and all that makes a first ball delightful?
I heard that your sister danced every dance.'</DD>

<DD>
'It was very pleasant,' said Molly, quietly. 'But, after all, I'm not sure
if I want to go to another just yet; there seems to be so much trouble
connected with a ball.'</DD>

<DD>
'Ah! you are thinking of your sister, and her not being well?'</DD>

<DD>
'No, I was not,' said Molly, rather bluntly. 'I was thinking of the dress,
and the dressing, and the weariness the next day.'</DD>

<DD>
He might think her unfeeling if he liked; she felt as if she had only too
much feeling just then, for it was bringing on her a strange contraction
of heart. But he was too inherently good himself to put any harsh construction
on her speech. Just before he went away, while he was ostensibly holding
her hand and wishing her good-by, he said to her in a voice too low to
be generally heard, -</DD>

<DD>
'Is there anything I could do for your sister? We have plenty of books,
as you know, if she cares for reading.' Then, receiving no affirmative
look or word from Molly in reply to this suggestion, he went on, - 'Or
flowers? she likes flowers. Oh! and our forced strawberries are just ready
- I will bring some over to-morrow.'</DD>

<DD>
'I am sure she will like them,' said Molly.</DD>

<DD>
For some reason or other, unknown to the Gibsons, a longer interval than
usual occurred between Osborne's visits, while Roger came almost every
day, always with some fresh offering by which he openly sought to relieve
Cynthia's indisposition as far as it lay in his power. Her manner to him
was so gentle and gracious that Mrs Gibson became alarmed, lest, in spite
of his 'uncouthness' (as she was pleased to term it), he might come to
be preferred to Osborne, who was so strangely neglecting his own interests,
in Mrs Gibson's opinion. In her quiet way, she contrived to pass many slights
upon Roger; but the darts rebounded from his generous nature that could
not have imagined her motives, and fastened themselves on Molly. She had
often been called naughty and passionate when she was a child; and she
thought now that she began to understand that she really had a violent
temper. What seemed neither to hurt Roger nor annoy Cynthia made Molly's
blood boil; and now she had once discovered Mrs Gibson's wish to make Roger's
visits shorter and less frequent, she was always on the watch for indications
of this desire. She read her stepmother's heart when the latter made allusions
to the squire's loneliness, now that Osborne was absent from the Hall,
and that Roger was so often away amongst his friends during the day, -</DD>

<DD>
'Mr Gibson and I should be so delighted if you could have stopped to dinner;
but, of course, we cannot be so selfish as to ask you to stay when we remember
how your father would be left alone. We were saying yesterday we wondered
how he bore his solitude, poor old gentleman!'</DD>

<DD>
Or, as soon as Roger came with his bunch of early roses, it was desirable
for Cynthia to go and rest in her own room, while Molly had to accompany
Mrs Gibson on some improvised errand or call. Still Roger, whose object
was to give pleasure to Cynthia, and who had, from his boyhood, been always
certain of Mr Gibson's friendly regard, was slow to perceive that he was
not wanted. If he did not see Cynthia, that was his loss; at any rate,
he heard how she was, and left her some little thing which he believed
she would like, and was willing to risk the chance of his own gratification
by calling four or five times in the hope of seeing her once. At last there
came a day when Mrs Gibson went beyond her usual negative snubbiness, and
when, in some unwonted fit of crossness, for she was a very placid-tempered
person in general, she was guilty of positive rudeness,</DD>

<DD>
Cynthia was very much better. Tonics had ministered to a mind diseased,
though she hated to acknowledge it; her pretty bloom and much of her light-heartedness
had come back, and there was no cause remaining for anxiety. Mrs Gibson
was sitting at her embroidery in the drawing-room, and the two girls were
at the window, Cynthia laughing at Molly's earnest endeavours to imitate
the French accent in which the former had been reading a page of Voltaire.
For the duty, or the farce, of settling to 'improving reading' in the mornings
was still kept up, although Lord Hollingford, the unconscious suggestor
of the idea, had gone back to town without making any of the efforts to
see Molly again that Mrs Gibson had anticipated on the night of the ball.
That Alnaschar vision had fallen to the ground. It was as yet early morning;
a delicious, fresh, lovely June day, the air redolent with the scents of
flower-growth and bloom; and half the time the girls had been ostensibly
employed in the French reading they had been leaning out of the open window
trying to reach a cluster of climbing roses. They had secured them at last,
and the bunch lay on Cynthia's lap, but many of the petals had fallen off,
so, though the perfume lingered about the window-seat, the full beauty
of the flowers had passed away. Mrs Gibson had once or twice reproved them
for the merry noise they had been making, which hindered her in the business
of counting the stitches in her pattern; and she had set herself a certain
quantity to do that morning before going out, and was of that nature which
attaches infinite importance to fulfilling small resolutions, made about
indifferent trifles without any reason whatever.</DD>

<DD>
'Mr Roger Hamley,' was announced. 'So tiresome!' said Mrs Gibson, almost
in his hearing, as she pushed away her embroidery frame. She put out her
cold, motionless hand to him, with a half-murmured word of welcome, still
eyeing her lost embroidery. He took no apparent notice, and passed on to
the window.</DD>

<DD>
'How delicious!' said he. 'No need for any more Hamley roses now yours
are out,'</DD>

<DD>
'I agree with you,' said Mrs Gibson, replying to him before either Cynthia
or Molly could speak, though he addressed his words to them. 'You have
been very kind in bringing us flowers so long; but now our own are out
we need not trouble you any more.'</DD>

<DD>
He looked at her with a little surprise clouding his honest face; it was
perhaps more at the tone than the words. Mrs Gibson, however, had been
bold enough to strike the first blow, and she determined to go on as opportunity
offered. Molly would perhaps have been more pained if she had not seen
Cynthia's colour rise. She waited for her to speak, if need were; for she
knew that Roger's defence, if defence were needed, might be safely entrusted
to Cynthia's ready wit.</DD>

<DD>
He put out his hand for the shattered cluster of roses that lay in Cynthia's
lap.</DD>

<DD>
'At any rate,' said he, 'my trouble - if Mrs Gibson considers it has been
a trouble to me - will be over-paid, if I may have this.'</DD>

<DD>
'Old lamps for new,' said Cynthia, smiling as she gave it to him. 'I wish
one could always buy nosegays such as you have brought us, as cheaply.'</DD>

<DD>
'You forget the waste of time that, I think, we must reckon as part of
the payment,' said her mother. 'Really, Mr Hamley, we must learn to shut
our doors on you if you come so often, and at such early hours! I settle
myself to my own employment regularly after breakfast till lunch-time;
and it is my wish to keep Cynthia and Molly to a course of improving reading
and study - so desirable for young people of their age, if they are ever
to become intelligent, companionable women; but with early visitors it
is quite impossible to observe any regularity of habits.'</DD>

<DD>
All this was said in that sweet, false tone which of late had gone through
Molly like the scraping of a slate-pencil on a slate. Roger's face changed.
His ruddy colour grew paler for a moment, and he looked grave and not pleased.
In another moment the wonted frankness of expression returned. Why should
not he, he asked himself, believe her? it was early to call; it did interrupt
regular occupation. So he spoke, and said, -</DD>

<DD>
'I believe I have been very thoughtless - I'll not come so early again;
but I had some excuse to-day: my brother told me you had made a plan for
going to see Hurst Wood when the roses were out, and they are earlier than
usual this year - I've been round to see. He spoke of a long day there,
going before lunch -- '</DD>

<DD>
'The plan was made with Mr Osborne Hamley. I could not think of going without
him!' said Mrs Gibson, coldly.</DD>

<DD>
'I had a letter from him this morning, in which he named your wish, and
he says he fears he cannot be at home till they are out of flower. I daresay
they are not much to see in reality, but the day is so lovely I thought
that the plan of going to Hurst Wood would be a charming excuse for being
out of doors.'</DD>

<DD>
'Thank you. How kind you are! and so good, too, in sacrificing your natural
desire to be with your father as much as possible.'</DD>

<DD>
'I am glad to say my father is so much better than he was in the winter
that he spends much of his time out of doors in his fields. He has been
accustomed to go about alone, and I - we think that as great a return to
his former habits as he can be induced to make, is the best for him.'</DD>

<DD>
'And when do you return to Cambridge?'</DD>

<DD>
There was some hesitation in Roger's manner as he replied, -</DD>

<DD>
'It is uncertain. You probably know that I am a Fellow of Trinity now.
I hardly yet know what my future plans may be; I am thinking of going up
to London soon.'</DD>

<DD>
'Ah! London is the true place for a young man,' said Mrs Gibson, with decision,
as if she had reflected a good deal on the question. 'If it were not that
we really are so busy this morning, I should have been tempted to make
an exception to our general rule; one more exception, for your early visits
have made us make too many already. Perhaps, however, we may see you again
before you go?'</DD>

<DD>
'Certainly I shall come,' replied he, rising to take his leave, and still
holding the demolished roses in his hand. Then, addressing himself more
especially to Cynthia, he added, 'My stay in London will not exceed a fortnight
or so - is there anything I can do for you - or you?' turning a little
to Molly.</DD>

<DD>
'No, thank you very much,' said Cynthia, very sweetly, and then, acting
on a sudden impulse, she leant out of the window, and gathered him some
half-opened roses. 'You deserve these; do throw that poor shabby bunch
away.'</DD>

<DD>
His eyes brightened, his cheeks glowed. He took the offered buds, but did
not throw away the other bunch.</DD>

<DD>
'At any rate, I may come after lunch is over, and the afternoons and the
evenings will be the most delicious time of day a month hence.' He said
this to both Molly and Cynthia, but in his heart he addressed it to the
latter.</DD>

<DD>
Mrs Gibson affected not to hear what he was saying, but held out her limp
hand once more to him.</DD>

<DD>
'I suppose we shall see you when you return; and pray tell your brother
how we are longing to have a visit from him again.'</DD>

<DD>
When he had left the room, Molly's heart was quite full. She had watched
his face, and read something of his feelings: his disappointment at their
non-acquiescence in his plan of a day's pleasure in Hurst Wood, the delayed
conviction that his presence was not welcome to the wife of his old friend,
which had come so slowly upon him - perhaps, after all, these things touched
Molly more keenly than they did him. His bright look when Cynthia gave
him the rosebuds indicated a gush of sudden delight more vivid than the
pain he had shown by his previous increase of gravity.</DD>

<DD>
'I can't think why he will come at such untimely hours,' said Mrs Gibson,
as soon as she heard him fairly out of the house. 'It's different from
Osborne; we are so much more intimate with him: he came and made friends
with us all the time this stupid brother of his was muddling his brains
with mathematics at Cambridge. Fellow of Trinity, indeed! I wish he would
learn to stay there, and not come intruding here, and assuming that because
I asked Osborne to join in a picnic it was all the same to me which brother
came.'</DD>

<DD>
'In short, mamma, one man may steal a horse, but another must not look
over the hedge,' said Cynthia, pouting a little.</DD>

<DD>
'And the two brothers have always been treated so exactly alike by their
friends, and there has been such a strong friendship between them, that
it is no wonder Roger thinks he may be welcome where Osborne is allowed
to come at all hours,' continued Molly, in high dudgeon. 'Roger's "muddled
brains," indeed! Roger, "stupid!"'</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, very well, my dears! When I was young it wouldn't have been thought
becoming for girls of your age to fly out because a little restraint was
exercised as to the hours at which they should receive the young men's
calls. And they would have supposed that there might be good reasons why
their parents disapproved of the visits of certain gentlemen, even while
they were proud and pleased to see some members of the same family.'</DD>

<DD>
'But that was what I said, mamma,' said Cynthia, looking at her mother
with an expression of innocent bewilderment on her face. 'One man may --

'Be quiet, child! All proverbs are vulgar, and I do believe that is the
vulgarest of all. You are really catching Roger Hamley's coarseness, Cynthia!'</DD>

'Mamma,' said Cynthia, roused to anger, 'I don't mind your abusing me,
but Mr Roger Hamley has been very kind to me while I've not been well:
I can't bear to hear him disparaged. If he's coarse, I've no objection
to be coarse as well, for it seems to me it must mean kindliness and pleasantness,
and the bringing of pretty flowers and presents.'</DD>

Molly's tears were brimming over at these words; she could have kissed
Cynthia for her warm partisanship, but, afraid of betraying emotion, and
'making a scene,' as Mrs Gibson called any signs of warm feeling, she laid
down her book hastily, and ran upstairs to her room, and locked the door
in order to breathe freely. There were traces of tears upon her face when
she returned into the drawing-room half-an-hour afterwards, walking straight
and demurely up to her former place, where Cynthia still sate and gazed
idly out of the window, pouting and displeased; Mrs Gibson, meanwhile,
counting her stitches aloud with great distinctness and vigour.</DD>
