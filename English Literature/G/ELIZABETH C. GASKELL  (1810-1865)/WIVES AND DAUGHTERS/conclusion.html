<P>Here the story is broken off, and it can never be finished. What promised
to be the crowning work of a life is a memorial of death. A few days longer,
and it would have been a triumphal column, crowned with a capital of festal
leaves and flowers: now it is another sort of column - one of those sad
white pillars which stand broken in the churchyard.

<P>But if the work is not quite complete, little remains to be added to
it, and that little has been distinctly reflected into our minds. We know
that Roger Hamley will marry Molly, and that is what we are most concerned
about. Indeed, there was little else to tell. Had the writer lived, she
would have sent her hero back to Africa forthwith; and those scientific
parts of Africa are a long way from Hamley; and there is not much to choose
between a long distance and a long time. How many hours are there in twenty-four
when you are all alone in a desert place, a thousand miles from the happiness
which might be yours to take - if you were there to take it? How many,
when from the sources of the Topinambo your heart flies back ten times
a day, like a carrier-pigeon, to the one only source of future good for
you, and ten times a day returns with its message undelivered? Many more
than are counted on the calendar. So Roger found. The days were weeks that
separated him from the time when Molly gave him a certain little flower,
and months from the time which divorced him from Cynthia, whom he had begun
to doubt before he knew for certain that she was never much worth hoping
for. And if such were his days, what was the slow procession of actual
weeks and months in those remote and solitary places? They were like years
of a stay-at-home life, with liberty and leisure to see that nobody was
courting Molly meanwhile. The effect of this was, that long before the
term of his engagement was ended all that Cynthia had been to him was departed
from Roger's mind, and all that Molly was and might be to him filled it
full.

<P>He returned; but when he saw Molly again he remembered that to her the
time of his absence might not have seemed so long, and was oppressed with
the old dread that she would think him fickle. Therefore this young gentleman,
so self-reliant and so lucid in scientific matters, found it difficult
after all to tell Molly how much he hoped she loved him; and might have
blundered if he had not thought of beginning by showing her the flower
that was plucked from the nosegay. How charmingly that scene would have
been drawn, had Mrs Gaskell lived to depict it, we can only imagine: that
it <I>would</I> have been charming - especially in what Molly did, and
looked, and said - we know.

<P>Roger and Molly are married; and if one of them is happier than the
other, it is Molly. Her husband has no need to draw upon the little fortune
which is to go to poor Osborne's boy, for he becomes professor at some
grey scientific institution, and wins his way in the world handsomely.
The squire is almost as happy in this marriage as his son. If any one suffers
for it, it is Mr Gibson. But he takes a partner, so as to get a chance
of running up to London to stay with Molly for a few days now and then,
and 'to get a little rest from Mrs Gibson.' Of what was to happen to Cynthia
after her marriage the author was not heard to say much, and, indeed, it
does not seem that anything needs to be added. One little anecdote, however,
was told of her by Mrs Gaskell, which is very characteristic. One day,
when Cynthia and her husband were on a visit to Hollingford, Mr Henderson
learned for the first time, through an innocent casual remark of Mr Gibson's,
that the famous traveller, Roger Hamley, was known to the family. Cynthia
had never happened to mention it. How well that little incident, too, would
have been described!

<P>But it is useless to speculate upon what would have been done by the
delicate strong hand which can create no more Molly Gibsons - no more Roger
Hamleys. We have repeated, in this brief note, all that is known of her
designs for the story, which would have been completed in another chapter.
There is not so much to regret, then, so far as this novel is concerned;
indeed, the regrets of those who knew her are less for the loss of the
novelist than of the woman - one of the kindest and wisest of her time.
But yet, for her own sake <I>as</I> a novelist alone, her untimely death
is a matter for deep regret. It is clear in this novel of <I>Wives and
Daughters</I>, in the exquisite little story that preceded it, <I>Cousin
Phillis</I>, and in <I>Sylvia's Lovers</I>, that Mrs Gaskell had within
these five years started upon a new career with all the freshness of youth,
and with a mind which seemed to have put off its clay and to have been
born again. But that 'put off its clay' must be taken in a very narrow
sense. All minds are tinctured more or less with the 'muddy vesture' in
which they are contained; but few minds ever showed less of base earth
than Mrs Gaskell's. It was so at all times; but lately even the original
slight tincture seemed to disappear. While you read any one of the last
three books we have named, you feel yourself caught out of an abominable
wicked world, crawling with selfishness and reeking with base passions,
into one where there is much weakness, many mistakes, sufferings long and
bitter, but where it is possible for people to live calm and wholesome
lives. and, what is more, you feel that this is at least as real a world
as the other. The kindly spirit which thinks no ill looks out of her pages
irradiate; and while we read them, we breathe the purer intelligence which
prefers to deal with emotions and passions which have a living root in
minds within the pale of salvation, and not with those which rot without
it. This spirit is more especially declared in <I>Cousin Phillis</I> and
<I>Wives and Daughters</I> - their author's latest works; they seem to
show that for her the end of life was not descent amongst the clods of
the valley, but ascent into the purer air of the heaven-aspiring hills.

<P>We are saying nothing now of the merely intellectual qualities displayed
in these later works. Twenty years to come, that may be thought the more
important question of the two; in the presence of her grave we cannot think
so; but it is true, all the same, that as mere works of art and observation,
these later novels of Mrs Gaskell's are among the finest of our time. There
is a scene in <I>Cousin Phillis</I> - where Holman, making hay with his
men, ends the day with a psalm - which is not excelled as a picture in
all modern fiction; and the same may be said of that chapter of this last
story in which Roger smokes a pipe with the Squire after the quarrel with
Osborne. There is little in either of these scenes, or in a score of others
which succeed each other like gems in a cabinet, which the ordinary novel-maker
could 'seize.' There is no 'material' for <I>him</I> in half-a-dozen farming
men singing hymns in a field, or a discontented old gentleman smoking tobacco
with his son. Still less could he avail himself of the miseries of a little
girl sent to be happy in a fine house full of fine people: but it is just
in such things as these that true genius appears brightest and most unapproachable.
It is the same with the personages. in Mrs Gaskell's works. Cynthia is
one of the most difficult characters which have ever been attempted in
our time. Perfect art always obscures the difficulties it overcomes; and
it is not till we try to follow the processes by which such a character
as the Tito of <I>Romola</I> is created, for instance, that we begin to
understand what a marvellous piece of work it is. To be sure, Cynthia was
not so difficult, nor is it nearly so great a creation as that splendid
achievement of art and thought - of the rarest art, of the profoundest
thought. But she also belongs to the kind of characters which are conceived
only in minds large, clear, harmonious and just, and which can be portrayed
fully and without flaw only by hands obedient to the finest motions of
the mind. Viewed in this light, Cynthia is a more important piece of work
even than Molly, delicately as she is drawn, and true and harmonious as
that picture is also. And what we have said of Cynthia may be said with
equal truth of Osborne Hamley. The true delineation of a character like
that is as fine a test of art as the painting of a foot or a hand, which
also seems so easy, and in which perfection is most rare. In this case
the work is perfect. Mrs Gaskell had drawn a dozen characters more striking
than Osborne since she wrote <I>Mary Barton</I> but not one which shows
more exquisite finish.

<P>Another thing we may be permitted to notice, because it has a great
and general significance. It may be true that this is not exactly the place
for criticism, but since we are writing of Osborne Hamley, we cannot resist
pointing out a peculiar instance of the subtler conceptions which underlie
all really considerable works. Here are Osborne and Roger, two men who,
in every particular that can be seized for <I>description</I>, are totally
different creatures. Body and mind they are quite unlike. They have different
tastes; they take different ways: they are men of two sorts which, in the
society sense, never 'know' each other; and yet, never did brotherly blood
run more manifest than in the veins of those two. To make that manifest
without allowing the effort to peep out for a single moment, would be a
triumph of art; but it is a 'touch beyond the reach of art' to make their
likeness in unlikeness so natural a thing that we no more wonder about
it than we wonder at seeing the fruit and the bloom on the same bramble:
we have always seen them there together in blackberry season, and do not
wonder about it nor think about it at all. Inferior writers, even some
writers who are highly accounted, would have revelled in the 'contrast.'
persuaded that they were doing a fine anatomical dramatic thing by bringing
it out at every opportunity. To the author of <I>Wives and Daughters</I>
this sort of anatomy was mere dislocation. She began by having the people
of her story born in the usual way, and not built up like the Frankenstein
monster; and thus when Squire Hamley took a wife, it was then provided
that his two boys should be as naturally one and diverse as the fruit and
the bloom on the bramble. 'It goes without speaking.' These differences
are precisely what might have been expected from the union of Squire Hamley
with the town-bred, refined, delicate-minded woman whom he married; and
the affection of the young men, their kind-ness (to use the word in its
old and new meanings at once) is nothing but a reproduction of those impalpable
threads of love which bound the equally diverse father and mother in bonds
faster than the ties of blood.

<P>But we will not permit ourselves to write any more in this vein. It
is unnecessary to demonstrate to those who know what is and what is not
true literature that Mrs Gaskell was gifted with some of the choicest faculties
bestowed upon mankind; that these grew into greater strength and ripened
into greater beauty in the decline of her days; and that she has gifted
us with some the truest, purest works of fiction in the language. And she
was herself what her works show her to have been - a wise, good woman.
