<DD>
Molly grew up among these quiet people in calm monotony of life, without
any greater event than that which has been recorded, - the being left behind
at the Towers, until she was nearly seventeen. She had become a visitor
at the school, but she had never gone again to the annual festival at the
great house; it was easy to find some excuse for keeping away, and the
recollection of that day was not a pleasant one on the whole, though she
often thought how much she should like to see the gardens again.</DD>

<DD>
Lady Agnes was married; there was only Lady Harriet remaining at home;
Lord Hollingford, the eldest son, had lost his wife, and was a good deal
more at the Towers since he had become a widower. He was a tall ungainly
man, considered to be as proud as his mother, the countess; but, in fact,
he was only shy, and slow at making commonplace speeches. He did not know
what to say to people whose daily habits and interests were not the same
as his; he would have been very thankful for a handbook of small-talk,
and would have learnt off his sentences with good-humoured diligence. He
often envied the fluency of his garrulous father, who delighted in talking
to everybody, and was perfectly unconscious of the incoherence of his conversation.
But, owing to his constitutional reserve and shyness, Lord Hollingford
was not a popular man, although his kindness of heart was very great, his
simplicity of character extreme, and his scientific acquirements considerable
enough to entitle him to much reputation in the European republic of learned
men. In this respect Hollingford was proud of him. The inhabitants knew
that the great, grave, clumsy heir to its fealty was highly esteemed for
his wisdom; and that he had made one or two discoveries, though in what
direction they were not quite sure. But it was safe to point him out to
strangers visiting the little town, as 'That's Lord Hollingford - the famous
Lord Hollingford, you know; you must have heard of him, he is so scientific.'
If the strangers knew his name, they also knew his claims to fame; if they
did not, ten to one but they would make as if they did, and so conceal
not only their own ignorance, but that of their companions, is to the exact
nature of the sources of his reputation.</DD>

<DD>
He was left a widower, with two or three boys. They were at a public school;
so that their companionship could make the house in which he had passed
his married life but little of a home to him, and he consequently spent
much of his time at the Towers; where his mother was proud of him, and
his father very fond, but ever so little afraid of him. His friends were
always welcomed by Lord and Lady Cumnor; the former, indeed, was in the
habit of welcoming everybody everywhere; but it was a proof of Lady Cumnor's
real affection for her distinguished son, that she allowed him to ask what
she called 'all sorts of people' to the Towers. 'All sorts of people' meant
really those who were distinguished for science and learning, without regard
to rank; and, it must be confessed, without much regard to polished manners
likewise.</DD>

<DD>
Mr Hall, Mr Gibson's predecessor, had always been received with friendly
condescension by my lady, who had found him established as the family medical
man, when first she came to the Towers on her marriage; but she never thought
of interfering with his custom of taking his meals, if he needed refreshment,
in the housekeeper's room, not <I>with</I> the housekeeper, <I>bien entendu</I>.
The comfortable, clever, stout, and red-faced doctor would very much have
preferred this, even if he had had the choice given him (which he never
had) of taking his 'snack,' as he called it, with my lord and my lady,
in the grand dining-room. Of course, if some great surgical gun (like Sir
Astley) was brought down from London to bear on the family's health, it
was due to him, as well as to the local medical attendant, to ask Mr Hall
to dinner, in a formal and ceremonious manner, on which occasions Mr Hall
buried his chin in voluminous folds of white muslin, put on his black knee-breeches,
with bunches of ribbon at the sides, his silk stockings and buckled shoes,
and otherwise made himself excessively uncomfortable in his attire, and
went forth in state in a post-chaise from the 'George,' consoling himself
in the private corner of his heart for the discomfort he was enduring with
the idea of how well it would sound the next day in the cars of the squires
whom he was in the habit of attending. 'Yesterday at dinner the earl said,'
or 'the countess remarked,' or 'I was surprised to hear when I was dining
at the Towers yesterday.' But somehow things had changed since Mr Gibson
had become 'the doctor' <I>par excellence</I> at Hollingford. The Miss
Brownings thought that it was because he had such an elegant figure, and
'such a distinguished manner;' Mrs Goodenough, 'because of his aristocratic
connections' - 'the son of a Scotch duke, my dear, never mind on which
side of the blanket' - but the fact was certain; although he might frequently
ask Mrs Brown to give him something to cat in the housekeeper's room -
he had no time for all the fuss and ceremony of luncheon with my lady -
he was always welcome to the grandest circle of visitors in the house.
He might lunch with a duke any day that he chose; given that a duke was
forthcoming at the Towers. His accent was Scotch, not provincial. He had
not an ounce of superfluous flesh on his bones; and leanness goes a great
way to gentility. His complexion was sallow, and his hair black; in those
days, the decade after the conclusion of the great continental war, to
be sallow and black-a-vised was of itself a distinction;' he was not jovial
(as my lord remarked with a sigh, but it was my lady who endorsed the invitations),
sparing of his words, intelligent, and slightly sarcastic. Therefore he
was perfectly presentable.</DD>

<DD>
His Scotch blood (for that he was of Scotch descent there could be no manner
of doubt) gave him just the kind of thistly dignity which made every one
feel that they must treat him with respect; so on that head he was assured.
The grandeur of being an invited guest to dinner at the Towers from time
to time, gave him but little pleasure for many years, but it was a form
to be gone through in the way of his profession, without any idea of social
gratification.</DD>

<DD>
But when Lord Hollingford returned to make the Towers his home, affairs
were altered. Mr Gibson really heard and learnt things that interested
him seriously, and that gave a fresh flavour to his reading. From time
to time he met the leaders of the scientific world; odd-looking, simple-hearted
men, very much in earnest about their own particular subjects, and not
having much to say on any other. Mr Gibson found himself capable of appreciating
such persons, and also perceived that they valued his appreciation, as
it was honestly and intelligently given. Indeed, by-and-by, he began to
send contributions of his own to the more scientific of the medical journals,
and thus partly in receiving, partly in giving out information and accurate
thought, a new zest was added to his life. There was not much intercourse
between Lord Hollingford and himself; the one was too silent and shy, the
other too busy, to seek each other's society with the perseverance required
to do away with the social distinction of rank that prevented their frequent
meetings. But each was thoroughly pleased to come into contact with the
other. Each could rely on the other's respect and sympathy with a security
unknown to many who call themselves friends; and this was a source of happiness
to both; to Mr Gibson the most so, of course; for his range of intelligent
and cultivated society was the smaller. Indeed, there was no one equal
to himself among the men with whom he associated, and this he had felt
as a depressing influence, although he had never recognized the cause of
his depression. There was Mr Ashton, the vicar, who had succeeded Mr Browning,
a thoroughly good and kind-hearted man, but one without an original thought
in him; whose habitual courtesy and indolent mind led him to agree to every
opinion, not palpably heterodox, and to utter platitudes in the most gentlemanly
manner. Mr Gibson had once or twice amused himself, by leading the vicar
on in his agreeable admissions of arguments 'as perfectly convincing,'
and of statements as 'curious but undoubted,' till he had planted the poor
clergyman in a bog of heretical bewilderment. But then Mr Ashton's pain
and suffering at suddenly finding out into what a theological predicament
he had been brought, his real self-reproach at his previous admissions,
were so great that Mr Gibson lost all sense of fun, and hastened back to
the Thirty-nine Articles with all the good-will in life, as the only means
of soothing the vicar's conscience. On any other subject, except that of
orthodoxy, Mr Gibson could lead him any lengths; but then his ignorance
on most of them prevented bland acquiescence from arriving at any results
which could startle him. He had some private fortune, and was not married,
and lived the life of an indolent and refined bachelor; but though he himself
was no very active visitor among his poorer parishioners, he was always
willing to relieve their wants in the most liberal, and, considering his
habits, occasionally in the most self-denying manner, whenever Mr Gibson,
or any one else, made them clearly known to him. 'Use my purse as freely
as if it was your own, Gibson,' he was wont to say. 'I'm such a bad one
at going about and making talk to poor folk - I dare say I don't do enough
in that way - but I am most willing to give you anything for any one you
may consider in want.'</DD>

<DD>
'Thank you; I come upon you pretty often, I believe, and make very little
scruple about it; but if you'll allow me to suggest, it is, that you should
not try to make talk when you go into the cottages; but just talk.'</DD>

<DD>
'I don't see the difference,' said the vicar, a little querulously; 'but
I dare say there is a difference, and I have no doubt what you say is quite
true. I should not make talk, but talk; and as both are equally difficult
to me, you must let me purchase the privilege of silence by this ten-pound
note.'</DD>

<DD>
'Thank you. It is not so satisfactory to me; and, I should think, not to
yourself. But probably the Joneses and Greens will prefer it.'</DD>

<DD>
Mr Ashton would look with plaintive inquiry into Mr Gibson's face after
some such speech, as if asking if a sarcasm was intended. On the whole
they went on in the most amicable way; only beyond the gregarious feeling
common to most men, they had very little actual pleasure in each other's
society. Perhaps the man of all others to whom Mr Gibson took the most
kindly - at least, until Lord Hollingford came into the neighbourhood -
was a certain Squire Hamley. He and his ancestors had been called squire
as long back as local tradition extended. But there was many a greater
landowner in the county, for Squire Hamley's estate was not more than eight
hundred acres or so. But his family had been in possession of it long before
the Earls of Cumnor had been heard of; before the Hely-Harrisons had bought
Coldstone Park; no one in Hollingford knew the time when the Hamleys had
not lived at Hamley. 'Ever since the Heptarchy,' said the vicar. 'Nay,'
said Miss Browning, 'I have heard that there were Hamleys of Hamley before
the Romans.' The vicar was preparing a polite assent, when Mrs Goodenough
came in with a still more startling assertion. 'I have always heerd,' said
she, with all the slow authority of an oldest inhabitant, 'that there was
Hamleys of Hamley afore the time of the pagans.' Mr Ashton could only bow,
and say, 'Possibly, very possibly, madam.' But he said it in so courteous
a manner that Mrs Goodenough looked round in a gratified manner, as much
as to say, 'The Church confirms my words; who now will dare dispute them?'
At any rate, the Hamleys were a very old family, if not aborigines. They
had not increased their estate for centuries; they had held their own,
if even with an effort, and had not sold a rood of it for the last hundred
years or so. But they were not an adventurous race. They never traded,
or speculated, or tried agricultural improvements of any kind. They had
no capital in any bank; nor what perhaps would have been more in character,
hoards of gold in any stocking. Their mode of life was simple, and more
like that of yeomen than squires. Indeed Squire Hamley, by continuing the
primitive manners and customs of his forefathers, the squires of the eighteenth
century, did live more as a yeoman, when such a class existed, than as
a squire of this generation. There was a dignity in this quiet conservatism
that gained him an immense amount of respect both from high and low; and
he might have visited at every house in the county had he so chosen. But
he was very indifferent to the charms of society; and perhaps this was
owing to the fact that the squire, Roger Hamley, who at present lived and
reigned at Hamley, had not received so good an education as he ought to
have done. His father, Squire Stephen, had been plucked at Oxford, and,
with stubborn pride, he had refused to go up again. Nay, more! he had sworn
a great oath, as men did in those days, that none of his children to come
should ever know either university by becoming a member of it. He had only
one child, the present squire, and he was brought up according to his father's
word; he was sent to a petty provincial school, where he saw much that
he hated, and then turned loose upon the estate as its heir. Such a bringing
up did not do him all the harm that might have been anticipated. He was
imperfectly educated, and ignorant on many points; but he was aware of
his deficiency, and regretted it in theory. He was awkward and ungainly
in society, and so kept out of it as much as possible; and he was obstinate,
violent-tempered, and dictatorial in his own immediate circle. On the other
side, he was generous, and true as steel; the very soul of honour in fact.
He had so much natural shrewdness, that his conversation was always worth
listening to, although he was apt to start by assuming entirely false premisses,
which he considered as incontrovertible as if they had been mathematically
proved; but, given the correctness of his premisses, nobody could bring
more natural wit and sense to bear upon the arguments based upon them.</DD>

<DD>
He had married a delicate fine London lady; it was one of those perplexing
marriages of which one cannot understand the reasons. Yet they were very
happy, though possibly Mrs Hamley would not have sunk into the condition
of a chronic invalid, if her husband had cared a little more for her various
tastes, or allowed her the companionship of those who did. After his marriage
he was wont to say he had got all that was worth having out of that crowd
of houses they called London. It was a compliment to his wife which he
repeated until the year of her death; it charmed her at first, it pleased
her up to the last time of her hearing it; but, for all that, she used
sometimes to wish that he would recognize the fact that there might still
be something worth hearing and seeing in the great city. But he never went
there again, and though he did not prohibit her going, yet he showed so
little sympathy with her when she came back full of what she had done on
her visit that she ceased caring to go. Not but what he was kind and willing
in giving his consent, and in furnishing her amply with money. 'There,
there, my little woman, take that! Dress yourself up as fine as any on
'em, and buy what you like, for the credit of Hamley of Hamley; and go
to the park and the play, and show off with the best on 'em. I shall be
glad to see thee back again, I know; but have thy fling while thou art
about it.' Then when she came back it was, 'Well, well, it has pleased
thee, I suppose, so that's all right. But the very talking about it tires
me, I know, and I can't think how you have stood it all. Come out and see
how pretty the flowers are looking in the south garden. I've made them
sow all the seeds you like; and I went over to Hollingford nursery to buy
the cuttings of the plants you admired last year. A breath of fresh air
will clear my brain after listening to all this talk about the whirl of
London, which is like to have turned me giddy.'</DD>

<DD>
Mrs Hamley was a great reader, and had considerable literary taste. She
was gentle and sentimental; tender and good. She gave up her visits to
London; she gave up her sociable pleasure in the company of her fellows
in education and position. Her husband, owing to the deficiencies of his
early years, disliked associating with those to whom he ought to have been
an equal; he was too proud to mingle with his inferiors. He loved his wife
all the more dearly for her sacrifices for him; but, deprived of all her
strong interests, she sank into ill-health; nothing definite; only she
never was well. Perhaps if she had had a daughter it would have been better
for her; but her two children were boys, and their father, anxious to give
them the advantages of which he himself had suffered the deprivation, sent
the lads very early to a preparatory school. They were to go on to Rugby
and Cambridge; the idea of Oxford was hereditarily distasteful in the Hamley
family. Osborne, the eldest - so called after his mother's maiden name
- was full of tastes, and had some talent. His appearance had all the grace
and refinement of his mother's. He was sweet-tempered and affectionate,
almost as demonstrative as a girl. He did well at school, carrying away
many prizes; and was, in a word, the pride and delight of both father and
mother; the confidential friend of the latter, in default of any other.
Roger was two years younger than Osborne; clumsy and heavily built, like
his father; his face was square, and the expression grave, and rather immobile.
He was good, but dull, his schoolmasters said. He won no prizes, but brought
home a favourable report of his conduct. When he caressed his mother, she
used laughingly to allude to the fable of the lap-dog and the donkey; so
thereafter he left off all personal demonstration of affection. It was
a great question as to whether he was to follow his brother to college
after he left Rugby. Mrs Hamley thought it would be rather a throwing away
of money, as he was so little likely to distinguish himself in intellectual
pursuits; anything practical - such as a civil engineer - would be more
the line of life for him. She thought that it would be too mortifying for
him to go to the same college and university as his brother, who was sure
to distinguish himself - and, to be repeatedly plucked, to come away wooden-spoon
at last. But his father persevered doggedly, as was his wont, in his intention
of giving both his sons the same education; they should both have the advantages
of which he had been deprived. If Roger did not do well at Cambridge it
would be his own fault. If his father did not send him thither, some day
or other he might be regretting the omission, as Squire Roger had done
himself for many a year. So Roger followed his brother Osborne to Trinity,'
and Mrs Hamley was again left alone, after the year of indecision as to
Roger's destination, which had been brought on by her urgency. She had
not been able for many years to walk beyond her garden; the greater part
of her life was spent on a sofa, wheeled to the window in summer, to the
fireside in winter. The room which she inhabited was large and pleasant;
four tall windows looked out upon a lawn dotted over with flower-beds,
and melting away into a small wood, in the centre of which there was a
pond, filled with water-lilies. About this unseen pond in the deep shade
Mrs Hamley had written many a pretty four-versed poem since she lay on
her sofa, alternately reading and composing poetry. She had a small table
by her side on which there were the newest works of poetry and fiction;
a pencil and blotting-book, with loose sheets of blank paper; a vase of
flowers always of her husband's gathering; winter and summer, she had a
sweet fresh nosegay every day. Her maid brought her a draught of medicine
every three hours, with a glass of clear water and a biscuit; her husband
came to her as often as his love for the open air and his labours out-of-doors
permitted; but the event of her day, when her boys were absent, was Mr
Gibson's frequent professional visits.</DD>

<DD>
He knew there was real secret harm going on all this time that people spoke
of her as a merely fanciful invalid; and that one or two accused him of
humouring her fancies. But he only smiled at such accusations. He felt
that his visits were a real pleasure and lightening of her growing and
indescribable discomfort; he knew that Squire Hamley would have been only
too glad if he had come every day; and he was conscious that by careful
watching of her symptoms he might mitigate her bodily pain. Besides all
these reasons, he took great pleasure in the squire's society. Mr Gibson
enjoyed the other's unreasonableness; his quaintness; his strong conservatism
in religion, politics, and morals. Mrs Hamley tried sometimes to apologize
for, or to soften away, opinions which she fancied were offensive to the
doctor, or contradictions which she thought too abrupt; but at such times
her husband would lay his great hand almost caressingly on Mr Gibson's
shoulder, and soothe his wife's anxiety, by saying, 'Let us alone, little
woman. We understand each other, don't we, doctor? Why, bless your life,
he gives me better than he gets many a time; only, you see, he sugars it
over, and says a sharp thing, and pretends it's all civility and humility;
but I can tell when he's giving me a pill.'</DD>

<DD>
One of Mrs Hamley's often-expressed wishes had been, that Molly might come
and pay her a visit. Mr Gibson always refused this request of hers, though
he could hardly have given his reasons for these refusals. He did not want
to lose the companionship of his child, in fact; but he put it to himself
in quite a different way. He thought her lessons and her regular course
of employment would be interrupted. The life in Mrs Hamley's heated and
scented room would not be good for the girl; Osborne and Roger Hamley would
be at home, and he did not wish Molly to be thrown too exclusively upon
them for young society; or they would not be at home, and it would be rather
dull and depressing for his girl to be all the day long with a nervous
invalid.</DD>

<DD>
But at length the day came when Mr Gibson rode over, and volunteered a
visit from Molly; an offer which Mrs Hamley received with the 'open arms
of her heart,' as she expressed it; and of which the duration was unspecified.
And the cause for this change in Mr Gibson's wishes was as follows: - It
has been mentioned that he took pupils, rather against his inclination,
it is true; but there they were, a Mr Wynne and Mr Coxe, 'the young gentlemen,'
as they were called in the household; 'Mr Gibson's young gentlemen,' as
they were termed in the town. Mr Wynne was the elder, the more experienced
one, who could occasionally take his master's place, and who gained experience
by visiting the poor, and the 'chronic cases.' Mr Gibson used to talk over
his practice with Mr Wynne, and try and elicit his opinions in the vain
hope that, some day or another, Mr Wynne might start an original thought.
The young man was cautious and slow; he would never do any harm by his
rashness, but at the same time he would always be a little behind his day.
Still Mr Gibson remembered that he had had far worse 'young gentlemen'
to deal with; and was content with, if not thankful for, such an elder
pupil as Mr Wynne. Mr Coxe was a boy of nineteen or so, with brilliant
red hair, and a tolerably red face, of both of which he was very conscious
and much ashamed. He was the son of an Indian officer, an old acquaintance
of Mr Gibson's. Major Coxe was at some unpronounceable station in the Punjaub,
at the present time; but the year before he had been in England, and had
repeatedly expressed his great satisfaction at having placed his only child
as a pupil to his old friend, and had in fact almost charged Mr Gibson
with the guardianship as well as the instruction of his boy, giving him
many injunctions which he thought were special in this case; but which
Mr Gibson with a touch of annoyance assured the major were always attended
to in every case, with every pupil. But when the poor major ventured to
beg that his boy might be considered as one of the family, and that he
might spend his evenings in the drawing-room instead of the surgery, Mr
Gibson turned upon him with a direct refusal.</DD>

<DD>
'He must live like the others. I can't have the pestle and mortar carried
into the drawing-room, and the place smelling of aloes.'</DD>

<DD>
'Must my boy make pills himself, then?' asked the major, ruefully.</DD>

<DD>
'To be sure. The youngest apprentice always does. It's not hard work. He'll
have the comfort of thinking he won't have to swallow them himself. And
he'll have the run of the pomfret cakes, and the conserve of hips, and
on Sundays he shall have a taste of tamarinds to reward him for his weekly
labour at pill-making.'</DD>

<DD>
Major Coxe was not quite sure whether Mr Gibson was not laughing at him
in his sleeve; but things were so far arranged, and the real advantages
were so great that he thought it was best to take no notice, but even to
submit to the indignity of pill-making. He was consoled for all these rubs
by Mr Gibson's manner at last when the supreme moment of final parting
arrived. The doctor did not say much; but there was something of real sympathy
in his manner that spoke straight to the father's heart, and an implied
'you have trusted me with your boy, and I have accepted the trust in full,'
in each of the last few words.</DD>

<DD>
Mr Gibson knew his business and human nature too well to distinguish young
Coxe by any overt marks of favouritism; but he could not help showing the
lad occasionally that he regarded him with especial interest as the son
of a friend. Besides this claim upon his regard, there was something about
the young man himself that pleased Mr Gibson. He was rash and impulsive,
apt to speak, hitting the nail on the head sometimes with unconscious cleverness,
at other times making gross and startling blunders. Mr Gibson used to tell
him that his motto would always be 'kill or cure,' and to this Mr Coxe
once made answer that he thought it was the best motto a doctor could have;
for if he could not cure the patient, it was surely best to get him out
of his misery quietly, and at once. Mr Wynne looked up in surprise, and
observed that he should be afraid that such putting out of misery might
be looked upon as homicide by some people. Mr Gibson said in a dry tone,
that for his part he should not mind the imputation of homicide, but that
it would not do to make away with profitable patients in so speedy a manner;
and that he thought that as long as they were willing and able to pay two-and-sixpence
for the doctor's visit, it was his duty to keep them alive; of course,
when they became paupers the case was different. Mr Wynne pondered over
this speech; Mr Coxe only laughed. At last Mr Wynne said, -</DD>

<DD>
'But you go every morning, sir, before breakfast to see old Nancy Grant,
and you've ordered her this medicine, sir, which is about the most costly
in Corbyn's bill?'</DD>

<DD>
'Have you not found out how difficult it is for men to live up to their
precepts? You've a great deal to learn yet, Mr Wynne!' said Mr Gibson,
leaving the surgery as he spoke.</DD>

<DD>
'I never can make the governor out,' said Mr Wynne, in a tone of utter
despair. 'What are you laughing at, Coxey?'</DD>

<DD>
'Oh! I'm thinking how blest you are in having parents who have instilled
moral principles into your youthful bosom. You'd go and be poisoning all
the paupers off, if you hadn't been told that murder was a crime by your
mother; you'd be thinking you were doing as you were bid, and quote old
Gibson's words when you came to be tried. "Please, my lord judge, they
were not able to pay for my visits, and so I followed the rules of the
profession as taught me by Mr Gibson, the great surgeon at Hollingford,
and poisoned the paupers." '</DD>

<DD>
'I can't bear that scoffing way of his.'</DD>

<DD>
'And I like it. If it wasn't for the governor's fun, and the tamarinds,
and something else that I know of, I would run off to India. I hate stifling
rooms, and sick people, and the smell of drugs, and the stink of pills
on my hands; - faugh!'</DD>
