MAKING FRIENDSHIP</H4></CENTER>

<DL>
<DD>
Mr Gibson believed that Cynthia Kirkpatrick was to return to England to
be present at her mother's wedding; but Mrs Kirkpatrick had no such intention.
She was not what is commonly called a woman of determination; but somehow
what she disliked she avoided, and what she liked she tried to do, or to
have. So although in the conversation, which she had already led to, as
to the when and the how she was to be married, she had listened quietly
to Mr Gibson's proposal that Molly and Cynthia should be the two bridesmaids,
she had felt how disagreeable it would be to her to have her young daughter
flashing out her beauty by the side of the faded bride, her mother; and
as the further arrangements for the wedding became more definite, she saw
further reasons in her own mind for Cynthia's remaining quietly at her
school at Boulogne.</DD>

<DD>
Mrs Kirkpatrick had gone to bed that first night of her engagement to Mr
Gibson, fully anticipating a speedy marriage. She looked to it as a release
from the thraldom of keeping school; keeping an unprofitable school, with
barely enough of pupils to pay for house-rent and taxes, food, washing,
and the requisite masters. She saw no reason for ever going back to Ashcombe,
except to wind up her affairs, and to pack up her clothes. She hoped that
Mr Gibson's ardour would be such that he would press on the marriage, and
urge her never to resume her school drudgery, but to relinquish it now
and for ever. She even made up a very pretty, very passionate speech for
him in her own mind; quite sufficiently strong to prevail upon her, and
to overthrow the scruples which she felt that she ought to have, at telling
the parents of her pupils that she did not intend to resume school, and
that they must find another place of education for their daughters, in
the last week but one of the midsummer holidays.</DD>

<DD>
It was rather like a douche of cold water on Mrs Kirkpatrick's plans, when
the next morning at breakfast Lady Cumnor began to decide upon the arrangements
and duties of the two middle-aged lovers.</DD>

<DD>
'Of course you can't give up your school all at once, Clare. The wedding
can't be before Christmas, but that will do very well. We shall all be
down at the Towers; and it will be a nice amusement for the children to
go over to Ashcombe, and see you married.'</DD>

<DD>
'I think - I am afraid - I don't believe Mr Gibson will like waiting so
long; men are so impatient under these circumstances.'</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, nonsense! Lord Cumnor has recommended you to his tenants, and I'm
sure he wouldn't like them to be put to any inconvenience. Mr Gibson will
see that in a moment. He's a man of sense, or else he wouldn't be our family
doctor. Now, what are you going to do about your little girl? Have you
fixed yet?'</DD>

<DD>
'No. Yesterday there seemed so little time, and when one is agitated it
is so difficult to think of everything. Cynthia is nearly eighteen, old
enough to go out as a governess, if he wishes it, but I don't think he
will. He is so generous and kind.'</DD>

<DD>
'Well! I must give you time to settle some of your affairs to-day. Don't
waste it in sentiment, you're too old for that. Come to a clear understanding
with each other; it will be for your happiness in the long run.'</DD>

<DD>
So they did come to a clear understanding about one or two things. To Mrs
Kirkpatrick's dismay, she found that Mr Gibson had no more idea than Lady
Cumnor of her breaking faith with the parents of her pupils. Though he
really was at a serious loss as to what was to become of Molly until she
could be under the protection of his new wife at her own home, and though
his domestic worries teased him more and more every day, he was too honourable
to think of persuading Mrs Kirkpatrick to give up school a week sooner
than was right for his sake. He did not even perceive how easy the task
of persuasion would be; with all her winning wiles she could scarcely lead
him to feel impatience for the wedding to take place at Michaelmas.</DD>

<DD>
'I can hardly tell you what a comfort and relief it will be to me, Hyacinth,
when you are once my wife - the mistress of my home - poor little Molly's
mother and protector; but I wouldn't interfere with your previous engagements
for the world. It wouldn't be right.'</DD>

<DD>
'Thank you, my own love. How good you are! So many men would think only
of their own wishes and interests! I'm sure the parents of my dear pupils
will admire you - will be quite surprised at your consideration for their
interests.'</DD>

<DD>
'Don't tell them, then. I hate being admired. Why shouldn't you say it
is your wish to keep on your school till they've had time to look out for
another?'</DD>

<DD>
'Because it isn't,' said she, daring all. 'I long to be making you happy;
I want to make your home a place of rest and comfort to you; and I do so
wish to cherish your sweet Molly, as I hope to do, when I come to be her
mother. I can't take virtue to myself which doesn't belong to me. If I
have to speak for myself, I shall say, "Good people, find a school for
your daughters by Michaelmas, - for after that time I must go and make
the happiness of others." I can't bear to think of your long rides in November
- coming home wet at night with no one to take care of you. Oh! if you
leave it to me, I shall advise the parents to take their daughters away
from the care of one whose heart will be absent. Though I couldn't consent
to any time before Michaelmas - that wouldn't be fair or right, and I'm
sure you wouldn't urge me - you are too good.'</DD>

<DD>
'Well, if you think that they will consider we have acted uprightly by
them, let it be Michaelmas with all my heart. What does Lady Cumnor say?'</DD>

<DD>
'Oh! I told her I was afraid you wouldn't like waiting, because of your
difficulties with your servants, and because of Molly - it would be so
desirable to enter on the new relationship with her as soon as possible.'</DD>

<DD>
'To be sure; so it would. Poor child! I'm afraid the intelligence of my
engagement has rather startled her.'</DD>

<DD>
'Cynthia will feel it deeply, too,' said Mrs Kirkpatrick, unwilling to
let her daughter be behind Mr Gibson's in sensibility and affection.</DD>

<DD>
'We will have her over to the wedding! She and Molly shall be bridesmaids,'
said Mr Gibson, in the unguarded warmth of his heart.</DD>

<DD>
This plan did not quite suit Mrs Kirkpatrick; but she thought it best not
to oppose it, until she had a presentable excuse to give, and perhaps also
some reason would naturally arise out of future circumstances; so at this
time she only smiled, and softly pressed the hand she held in hers.</DD>

<DD>
It is a question whether Mrs Kirkpatrick or Molly wished the most for the
day to be over which they were to spend together at the Towers. Mrs Kirkpatrick
was rather weary of girls as a class. All the trials of her life were connected
with girls in some way. She was very young when she first became a governess,
and had been worsted in her struggles with her pupils, in the first place
she ever went to. Her elegance of appearance and manner, and her accomplishments,
more than her character and acquirements, had rendered it more easy for
her than for most to obtain good 'situations;' and she had been absolutely
petted in some; but still she was constantly encountering naughty or stubborn,
or over-conscientious, or severe-judging, or curious and observant girls.
And again, before Cynthia was born, she had longed for a boy, thinking
it possible that if some three or four intervening relations died, he might
come to be a baronet; and instead of a son, lo and behold it was a daughter!
Nevertheless, with all her dislike to girls in the abstract as 'the plagues
of her life' (and her aversion was not diminished by the fact of her having
kept a school for 'young ladies' at Ashcombe), she really meant to be as
kind as she could be to her new step-daughter, whom she remembered principally
as a black-haired, sleepy child, in whose eyes she had read admiration
of herself. Mrs Kirkpatrick accepted Mr Gibson principally because she
was tired of the struggle of earning her own livelihood; but she liked
him personally - nay, she even loved him in her torpid way, and she intended
to be good to his daughter, though she felt as if it would have been easier
for her to have been good to his son.</DD>

<DD>
Molly was bracing herself up in her way too. 'I will be like Harriet. I
will think of others. I won't think of myself,' she kept repeating all
the way to the Towers. But there was no selfishness in wishing that the
day was come to an end, and that she did very heartily. Mrs Hamley sent
her thither in the carriage, which was to wait and bring her back at night.
Mrs Hamley wanted Molly to make a favourable impression, and she sent for
her to come and show herself before she set out.</DD>

<DD>
'Don't put on your silk gown - your white muslin will look the nicest,
my dear.'</DD>

<DD>
'Not my silk? it is quite new! I had it to come here.'</DD>

<DD>
'Still, I think your white muslin suits you the best.' 'Anything but that
horrid plaid silk' was the thought in Mrs Hamley's mind; and, thanks to
her, Molly set off for the Towers, looking a little quaint, it is true,
but thoroughly ladylike, if she was old-fashioned. Her father was to meet
her there; but he had been detained, and she had to face Mrs Kirkpatrick
by herself, the recollection of her last day of misery at the Towers fresh
in her mind as if it had been yesterday. Mrs Kirkpatrick was as caressing
as could be. She held Molly's hand in hers, as they sate together in the
library, after the first salutations were over. She kept stroking it from
time to time, and purring out inarticulate sounds of loving satisfaction,
as she gazed in the blushing face.</DD>

<DD>
'What eyes! so like your dear father's! How we shall love each other -
shan't we, darling? For his sake!'</DD>

<DD>
'I'll try,' said Molly, bravely; and then she could not finish her sentence.</DD>

<DD>
'And you've just got the same beautiful black curling hair!' said Mrs Kirkpatrick,
softly lifting one of Molly's curls from off her white temple.</DD>

<DD>
'Papa's hair is growing grey,' said Molly.</DD>

<DD>
'Is it? I never see it. I never shall see it. He will always be to me the
handsomest of men.'</DD>

<DD>
Mr Gibson was really a very handsome man, and Molly was pleased with the
compliment; but she could not help saying, -</DD>

<DD>
'Still he will grow old, and his hair will grow grey. I think he will be
just as handsome, but it won't be as a young man.'</DD>

<DD>
'Ah! that's just it, love. He'll always be handsome; some people always
are. And he is so fond of you, dear.' Molly's colour flashed into her face.
She did not want an assurance of her own father's love from this strange
woman. She could not help being angry; all she could do was to keep silent.
'You don't know how he speaks of you; "his little treasure," as he calls
you. I'm almost jealous sometimes.'</DD>

<DD>
Molly took her hand away, and her heart began to harden; these speeches
were so discordant to her. But she set her teeth together, and 'tried to
be good.'</DD>

<DD>
'We must make him so happy. I'm afraid he has had a great deal to annoy
him at home; but we will do away with all that now. You must tell me,'
seeing the cloud in Molly's eyes, 'what he likes and dislikes, for of course
you will know.'</DD>

<DD>
Molly's face cleared a little; of course she did know. She had not watched
and loved him so long without believing that she understood him better
than any one else; though how he had come to like Mrs Kirkpatrick enough
to wish to marry her, was an unsolved problem that she unconsciously put
aside as inexplicable. Mrs Kirkpatrick went on, - 'All men have their fancies
and antipathies, even the wisest. I have known some gentlemen annoyed beyond
measure by the merest trifles; leaving a door open, or spilling tea in
their saucers, or a shawl crookedly put on. Why,' continued she, lowering
her voice, 'I know of a house to which Lord Hollingford will never be asked
again because he didn't wipe his shoes on both the mats in the hall! Now
you must tell me what your dear father dislikes most in these fanciful
ways, and I shall take care to avoid it. You must be my little friend and
helper in pleasing him. It will be such a pleasure to me to attend to his
slightest fancies. About my dress, too - what colours does he like best?
I want to do everything in my power with a view to his approval.'</DD>

<DD>
Molly was gratified by all this, and began to think that really, after
all, perhaps her father had done well for himself; and that if she could
help towards his new happiness, she ought to do it. So she tried very conscientiously
to think over Mr Gibson's wishes and ways; to ponder over what annoyed
him the most in his household.</DD>

<DD>
'I think,' said she, 'papa isn't particular about many things; but I think
our not having the dinner quite punctual - quite ready for him when he
comes in, fidgets him more than anything. You see, he has often had a long
ride, and there is another long ride to come, and he has only half-an -
hour - sometimes only a quarter - to cat his dinner in.'</DD>

<DD>
'Thank you, my own love. Punctuality! Yes; it's a great thing in a household.
It's what I've had to enforce with my young ladies at Ashcombe. No wonder
poor dear Mr Gibson has been displeased at his dinner not being ready,
and he so hard-worked!'</DD>

<DD>
'Papa doesn't care what he has, if it's only ready. He would take bread-and-cheese,
if cook would only send it in instead of dinner.'</DD>

<DD>
'Bread-and-cheese! Does Mr Gibson eat cheese?'</DD>

<DD>
'Yes; he's very fond of it,' said Molly, innocently. 'I've known him cat
toasted cheese when he has been too tired to fancy anything else.'</DD>

<DD>
'Oh! but, my dear, we must change all that. I shouldn't like to think of
your father eating cheese; it's such a strong-smelling, coarse kind of
thing. We must get him a cook who can toss him up an omelette, or something
elegant. Cheese is only fit for the kitchen.'</DD>

<DD>
'Papa is very fond of it,' persevered Molly.</DD>

<DD>
'Oh! but we will cure him of that. I couldn't bear the smell of cheese;
and I'm sure he would be sorry to annoy me.'</DD>

<DD>
Molly was silent; it did not do, she found, to be too minute in telling
about her father's likes or dislikes. She had better leave them for Mrs
Kirkpatrick to find out for herself. It was an awkward pause; each was
trying to find something agreeable to say. Molly spoke at length. 'Please!
I should so like to know something about Cynthia - your daughter.'</DD>

<DD>
'Yes, call her Cynthia. It's a pretty name, isn't it? Cynthia Kirkpatrick.
Not so pretty, though, as my old name, Hyacinth Clare. People used to say
it suited me so well. I must show you an acrostic a gentleman - he was
a lieutenant in the 53rd - made upon it. Oh! we shall have a great deal
to say to each other, I foresee!'</DD>

<DD>
'But about Cynthia?'</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, yes! about dear Cynthia. What do you want to know, my dear?'</DD>

<DD>
'Papa said she was to live with us! When will she come?'</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, was it not sweet of your kind father? I thought of nothing else but
Cynthia's going out as a governess when she had completed her education;
she has been brought up for it, and has had great advantages. But good
dear Mr Gibson wouldn't hear of it. He said yesterday that she must come
and live with us when she left school.'</DD>

<DD>
'When will she leave school?'</DD>

<DD>
'She went for two years. I don't think I must let her leave before next
summer. She teaches English as well as learning French. Next summer she
shall come home, and then shan't we be a happy little quartette?'</DD>

<DD>
'I hope so,' said Molly. 'But she is to come to the wedding, isn't she?'
she went on timidly, now knowing how far Mrs Kirkpatrick would like the
allusion to her marriage.</DD>

<DD>
'Your father has begged for her to come; but we must think about it a little
more before quite fixing it. The journey is a great expense!'</DD>

<DD>
'Is she like you? I do so want to see her.'</DD>

<DD>
'She is very handsome, people say. In the bright-coloured style, - perhaps
something like what I was. But I like the dark-haired foreign kind of beauty
best - just now,' touching Molly's hair, and looking at her with an expression
of sentimental remembrance.</DD>

<DD>
'Does Cynthia - is she very clever and accomplished?' asked Molly, a little
afraid lest the answer should remove Miss Kirkpatrick at too great a distance
from her.</DD>

<DD>
'She ought to be; I've paid ever so much money to have her taught by the
best masters. But you will see her before long, and I'm afraid we must
go now to Lady Cumnor. It has been very charming having you all to myself,
but I know Lady Cumnor will be expecting us now, and she was very curious
to see you, - my future daughter, as she calls you.'</DD>

<DD>
Molly followed Mrs Kirkpatrick into the morning-room, where Lady Cumnor
was sitting - a little annoyed, because, having completed her <I>toilette</I>
earlier than usual, Clare had not been aware by instinct of the fact, and
so had not brought Molly Gibson for inspection a quarter of an hour before.
Every small occurrence is an event in the day of a convalescent invalid,
and a little while ago Molly would have met with patronizing appreciation,
where now she had to encounter criticism. Of Lady Cumnor's character as
an individual she knew nothing; she only knew she was going to see and
be seen by a live countess; nay, more, by '<I>the</I> countess' of Hollingford.</DD>

<DD>
Mrs Kirkpatrick led her into Lady Cumnor's presence by the hand, and in
presenting her, said, - 'My dear little daughter, Lady Cumnor!'</DD>

<DD>
'Now, Clare, don't let me have nonsense. She is not your daughter yet,
and may never be, - I believe that one-third of the engagements I have
heard of, have never come to marriages. Miss Gibson, I am very glad to
see you, for your father's sake; when I know you better, I hope it will
be for your own.'</DD>

<DD>
Molly very heartily hoped that she might never be known any better by the
stern-looking lady who sate so uprightly in the easy chair, prepared for
lounging, and which therefore gave all the more effect to the stiff attitude.
Lady Cumnor luckily took Molly's silence for acquiescent humility, and
went on speaking after a further little pause of inspection.</DD>

<DD>
'Yes, yes, I like her looks, Clare. You may make something of her. It will
be a great advantage to you, my dear, to have a lady who has trained up
several young people of quality always about you just at the time when
you are growing up. I'll tell you what, Clare!' - a sudden thought striking
her, - 'you and she must become better acquainted - you know nothing of
each other at present; you are not to be married till Christmas, and what
could be better than that she should go back with you to Ashcombe! She
would be with you constantly, and have the advantage of the companionship
of your young people, which would be a good thing for an only child! It's
a capital plan; I'm very glad I thought of it!'</DD>

<DD>
Now it would be difficult to say which of Lady Cumnor's two hearers was
the most dismayed at the idea which had taken possession of her. Mrs Kirkpatrick
had no fancy for being encumbered with a step-daughter before her time.
If Molly came to be an inmate of her house, farewell to many little background
economies, and a still more serious farewell to many little indulgences,
that were innocent enough in themselves, but which Mrs Kirkpatrick's former
life had caused her to look upon as sins to be concealed: the dirty dog's-eared
delightful novel from the Ashcombe circulating library, the leaves of which
she turned over with a pair of scissors. the lounging-chair which she had
for use at her own home, straight and upright as she sate now in Lady Cumnor's
presence; the dainty morsel, savoury and small, to which she treated herself
for her own solitary supper, - all these and many other similarly pleasant
things would have to be foregone if Molly came to be her pupil, parlour-boarder,
or visitor, as Lady Cumnor was planning. One - two things Clare was instinctively
resolved upon: to be married at Michaelmas, and not to have Molly at Ashcombe.
But she smiled as sweetly as if the plan proposed was the most charming
project in the world, while all the time her poor brains were beating about
in every bush for the reasons or excuses of which she should make use at
some future time. Molly, however, saved her all this trouble. It was a
question which of the three was the most surprised by the words which burst
out of her lips. She did not mean to speak, but her heart was very full,
and almost before she was aware of her thought she heard herself saying,
-</DD>

<DD>
'I don't think it would be nice at all. I mean, my lady, that I should
dislike it very much; it would be taking me away from papa just these very
few last months. I will like you,' she went on, her eyes full of tears;
and, turning to Mrs Kirkpatrick, she put her hand into her future stepmother's
with the prettiest and most trustful action. 'I will try hard to love you,
and to do all I can to make you happy. but you must not take me away from
papa just this very last bit of time that I shall have him.'</DD>

<DD>
Mrs Kirkpatrick fondled the hand thus placed in hers, and was grateful
to the girl for her outspoken opposition to Lady Cumnor's plan. Clare was,
however, exceedingly unwilling to back up Molly by any words of her own
until Lady Cumnor had spoken and given the cue. But there was something
in Molly's little speech, or in her straightforward manner, that amused
instead of irritating Lady Cumnor in her present mood. Perhaps she was
tired of the silkiness with which she had been shut up for so many days.</DD>

<DD>
She put up her glasses, and looked at them both before speaking. Then she
said, - 'Upon my word, young lady! Why, Clare, you've got your work before
you! Not but what there is a good deal of truth in what she says. It must
be very disagreeable to a girl of her age to have a stepmother coming in
between her father and herself, whatever may be the advantages to her in
the long run.'</DD>

<DD>
Molly almost felt as if she could make a friend of the stiff old countess,
for her clearness of sight as to the plan proposed being a trial; but she
was afraid, in her new-born desire of thinking for others, of Mrs Kirkpatrick
being hurt. She need not have feared as far as outward signs went, for
the smile was still on that lady's pretty rosy lips, and the soft fondling
of her hand never stopped. Lady Cumnor was more interested in Molly the
more she looked at her; and her gaze was pretty steady through her gold-rimmed
eye-glasses. She began a sort of catechism; a string of very straightforward
questions, such as any lady under the rank of countess might have scrupled
to ask, but which were not unkindly meant.</DD>

<DD>
'You are sixteen, are you not?'</DD>

<DD>
'No; I am seventeen. My birthday was three weeks ago.'</DD>

<DD>
'Very much the same thing, I should think. Have you ever been to school?'</DD>

<DD>
'No, never! Miss Eyre has taught me everything I know.'</DD>

<DD>
'Umph! Miss Eyre was your governess, I suppose? I should not have thought
your father could have afforded to keep a governess. But of course he must
know his own affairs best.'</DD>

<DD>
'Certainly, my lady,' replied Molly, a little touchy as to any reflections
on her father's wisdom.</DD>

<DD>
'You say "certainly!" as if it was a matter of course that every one should
know their own affairs best. You are very young, Miss Gibson - very. You'll
know better before you come to my age. And I suppose you've been taught
music, and the use of the globes, and French, and all the usual accomplishments,
since you have had a governess? I never heard of such nonsense!' she went
on, lashing herself up. 'An only daughter! If there had been half-a-dozen
girls, there might have been some sense in it.'</DD>

<DD>
Molly did not speak but it was by a strong effort that she kept silence.
Mrs Kirkpatrick fondled her hand more perseveringly than ever, hoping thus
to express a sufficient amount of sympathy to prevent her from saying anything
injudicious. But the caress had become wearisome to Molly, and only irritated
her nerves. She took her hand out of Mrs Kirkpatrick's, with a slight manifestation
of impatience.</DD>

<DD>
It was, perhaps, fortunate for the general peace that just at this moment
Mr Gibson was announced. It is odd enough to see how the entrance of a
person of the opposite sex into an assemblage of either men or women calms
down the little discordances and the disturbance of mood. It was the case
now; at Mr Gibson's entrance my lady took off her glasses, and smoothed
her brow; Mrs Kirkpatrick managed to get up a very becoming blush, and
as for Molly, her face glowed with delight, and the white teeth and pretty
dimples came out like sunlight on a landscape.</DD>

<DD>
Of course, after the first greeting, my lady had to have a private interview
with her doctor; and Molly and her future stepmother wandered about in
the gardens with their arms round each other's waists, or hand in hand,
like the babes in the wood; Mrs Kirkpatrick active in such endearments,
Molly passive, and feeling within herself very shy and strange; for she
had that particular kind of shy modesty which makes any one uncomfortable
at receiving caresses from a person towards whom the heart does not go
forth with an impulsive welcome.</DD>

<DD>
Then came the early dinner; Lady Cumnor having hers in the quiet of her
own room, to which she was still a prisoner. Once or twice during the meal,
the idea crossed Molly's mind that her father disliked his position as
a middle-aged lover being made so evident to the men in waiting as it was
by Mrs Kirkpatrick's affectionate speeches and innuendos. He tried to banish
every tint of pink sentimentalism from the conversation, and to confine
it to matter of fact; and when Mrs Kirkpatrick would persevere in dwelling
upon such facts as had a bearing upon the future relationship of the parties,
he insisted upon viewing them in the most matter-of-fact way; and this
continued even after the men had left the room. An old rhyme Molly had
heard Betty use, would keep running in her head and making her uneasy,
-</DD>

<DD>
Two is company,</DD>

<DD>
Three is trumpery.</DD>

<DD>
But where could she go to in that strange house? What ought she to do?
She was roused from this fit of wonder and abstraction by her father's
saying, - 'What do you think of this plan of Lady Cumnor's? She says she
was advising you to have Molly as a visitor at Ashcombe until we are married.'</DD>

<DD>
Mrs Kirkpatrick's countenance fell. If only Molly would be so good as to
testify again, as she had done before Lady Cumnor! But if the proposal
was made by her father, it would come to his daughter from a different
quarter than it had done from a strange lady, be she ever so great. Molly
did not say anything; she only looked pale, and wistful, and anxious. Mrs
Kirkpatrick had to speak for herself.</DD>

'It would be a charming plan, only - Well! we know why we would rather
not have it, don't we, love? And we won't tell papa, for fear of making
him vain. No! I think I must leave her with you, dear Mr Gibson, for a
<I>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</I> for these last few weeks. It would
be cruel to take her away.'</DD>

<DD>
'But you know, my dear, I told you of the reason why it does not do to
have Molly at home just at present,' said Mr Gibson, eagerly. For the more
he knew of his future wife, the more he felt it necessary to remember that,
with all her foibles, she would be able to stand between Molly and any
such adventures as that which had occurred lately with Mr Coxe; so that
one of the good reasons for the step he had taken was always present to
him, while it had slipped off the smooth surface of Mrs Kirkpatrick's mirror-like
mind without leaving any impression. She now recalled it, on seeing Mr
Gibson's anxious face.</DD>

<DD>
But what were Molly's feelings at these last words of her father's? She
had been sent from home for some reason, kept a secret from her, but told
to this strange woman. Was there to be perfect confidence between these
two, and she to be for ever shut out? Was she, and what concerned her -
though how, she did not know - to be discussed between them for the future,
and she to be kept in the dark? A bitter pang of jealousy made her heart-sick.
She might as well go to Ashcombe, or anywhere else, now. Thinking more
of others' happiness than of her own was very fine; but did it not mean
giving up her very individuality, quenching all the warm love, the keen
desires, that made her herself? Yet in this deadness lay her only comfort;
or so it seemed. Wandering in such mazes, she hardly knew how the conversation
went on; a third was indeed 'trumpery,' where there was entire confidence
between the two who were company, from which the other was shut out. She
was positively unhappy, and her father did not appear to see it; he was
absorbed with his new plans and his new wife that was to be. But he did
notice it; and was keenly sorry for his little girl; only he thought that
there was a greater chance for the future harmony of the household, if
he did not lead Molly to define her present feelings by putting them into
words. It was his general plan to repress emotion by not showing the sympathy
he felt. Yet, when he had to leave, he took Molly's hand in his, and held
it there, in such a different manner to that in which Mrs Kirkpatrick had
done; and his voice softened to his child as he bade her good-by, and added
the words (most unusual to him), 'God bless you, child!'</DD>

<DD>
Molly had held up all the day bravely; she had not shown anger, or repugnance,
or annoyance, or regret; but when once more by herself in the Hamley carriage,
she burst into a passion of tears, and cried her fill till she reached
the village of Hamley. Then she tried in vain to smooth her face into smiles,
and do away with the other signs of her grief. She only hoped she could
run upstairs to her own room without notice, and bathe her eyes in cold
water before she was seen. But at the hall-door she was caught by the squire
and Roger coming in from an after-dinner stroll in the garden, and hospitably
anxious to help her to alight. Roger saw the state of things in an instant,
and saying, -</DD>

<DD>
'My mother has been looking for you to come back for this last hour,' he
led the way to the drawing-room. But Mrs Hamley was not there; the squire
had stopped to speak to the coachman about one of the horses; they two
were alone. Roger said, -</DD>

<DD>
'I am afraid you have had a very trying day. I have thought of you several
times, for I know how awkward these new relations are.'</DD>

<DD>
'Thank you,' said she, her lips trembling, and on the point of crying again.
'I did try to remember what you said, and to think more of others, but
it is so difficult sometimes; you know it is, don't you?'</DD>

<DD>
'Yes,' said he, gravely. He was gratified by her simple confession of having
borne his words of advice in mind, and tried to act up to them. He was
but a very young man, and he was honestly flattered; perhaps this led him
on to offer more advice, and this time it was evidently mingled with sympathy.
He did not want to draw out her confidence, which he felt might very easily
be done with such a simple girl; but he wished to help her by giving her
a few of the principles on which he had learnt to rely. 'It is difficult,'
he went on, 'but by-and-by you will be so much happier for it.'</DD>

<DD>
'No, I shan't!' said Molly, shaking her head. 'It will be very dull when
I shall have killed myself, as it were, and live only in trying to do,
and to be, as other people like. I don't see any end to it. I might as
well never have lived. And as for the happiness you speak of, I shall never
be happy again.'</DD>

<DD>
There was an unconscious depth in what she said, that Roger did not know
how to answer at the moment; it was easier to address himself to the assertion
of the girl of seventeen, that she should never be happy again.</DD>

<DD>
'Nonsense: perhaps in ten years' time you will be looking back on this
trial as a very light one - who knows?'</DD>

<DD>
'I daresay it seems foolish; perhaps all our earthly trials will appear
foolish to us after a while. perhaps they seem so now to angels. But we
are ourselves, you know, and this is now, not some time to come, a long,
long way off. And we are not angels, to be comforted by seeing the ends
for which everything is sent.'</DD>

<DD>
She had never spoken so long a sentence to him before; and when she had
said it, though she did not take her eyes away from his, as they stood
steadily looking at each other, she blushed a little; she could not have
told why. Nor did he tell himself why a sudden pleasure came over him as
he gazed at her simple expressive face - and for a moment lost the sense
of what she was saying, in the sensation of pity for her sad earnestness.
In an instant more he was himself again. Only it is pleasant to the wisest,
most reasonable youth of one or two and twenty to find himself looked up
to as a Mentor by a girl of seventeen.</DD>

<DD>
'I know, I understand. Yes: it is <I>now</I> we have to do with. Don't
let us go into metaphysics.' Molly opened her eyes wide at this. Had she
been talking metaphysics without knowing it? 'One looks forward to a mass
of trials, which will only have to be encountered one by one, little by
little. Oh, here is my mother! she will tell you better than I can.'</DD>

<DD>
And the <I>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</I> was merged in a trio. Mrs
Hamley lay down; she had not been well all day - she had missed Molly,
she said, - and now she wanted to hear of all the adventures that had occurred
to the girl at the Towers. Molly sate on a stool close to the head of the
sofa, and Roger, though at first he took up a book and tried to read that
he might be no restraint, soon found his reading all a pretence: it was
so interesting to listen to Molly's little narrative, and, besides, if
he could give her any help in her time of need, was it not his duty to
make himself acquainted with all the circumstances of her case?</DD>

<DD>
And so they went on during all the remaining time of Molly's stay at Hamley.
Mrs Hamley sympathized, and liked to hear details, as the French say, her
sympathy was given <I>en d&eacute;tail</I>, the squire's <I>en gros</I>.
He was very sorry for her evident grief, and almost felt guilty, as if
he had had a share in bringing it about, by the mention he had made of
the possibility of Mr Gibson's marrying again, when first Molly had come
on her visit to them. He said to his wife more than once, -</DD>

<DD>
''Pon my word, now, I wish I'd never spoken those unlucky words that first
day at dinner. Do you remember how she took them up? It was like a prophecy
of what was to come, now, wasn't it? And she looked pale from that day,
and I don't think she has ever fairly enjoyed her food since. I must take
more care what I say for the future. Not but what Gibson is doing the very
best thing, both for himself and her, that he can do. I told him so only
yesterday. But I'm very sorry for the little girl, though. I wish I'd never
spoken about it, that I do! but it was like a prophecy, wasn't it?'</DD>

<DD>
Roger tried hard to find out a reasonable and right method of comfort,
for he, too, in his way, was sorry for the girl, who bravely struggled
to be cheerful, in spite of her own private grief, for his mother's sake.
He felt as if high principle and noble precept ought to perform an immediate
work. But they do not, for there is always the unknown quantity of individual
experience and feeling, which offer a tacit resistance, the amount incalculable
by another, to all good counsel and high decree. But the bond between the
Mentor and his Telemachus strengthened every day. He endeavoured to lead
her out of morbid thought into interest in other than personal things;
and, naturally enough, his own objects of interest came readiest to hand.
She felt that he did her good, she did not know why or how; but after a
talk with him, she always fancied that she had got the clue to goodness
and peace, whatever befell.</DD>
