Osborne had his solitary cup of coffee in the drawing-room. He was very
unhappy too, after his fashion. He stood on the hearth-rug pondering over
his situation. He was not exactly aware how hardly his father was pressed
for ready-money; the squire had never spoken to him on the subject without
being angry; and many of his loose contradictory statements - all of which,
however contradictory they might appear, had their basis in truth - were
set down by his son to the exaggeration of passion. But it was uncomfortable
enough to a young man of Osborne's age to feel himself continually hampered
for want of a five-pound note. The principal supplies for the liberal -
almost luxurious table at the Hall, came off the estate; so that there
was no appearance of poverty as far as the household went; and as long
as Osborne was content at home, he had everything he could wish for; but
he had a wife elsewhere - he wanted to see her continually - and that necessitated
journeys. She, poor thing! had to be supported: where was the money for
the journeys and for Aim&eacute;e's modest wants to come from? That was
the puzzle in Osborne's mind just now. While he had been at college his
allowance - heir of the Hamleys - had been three hundred, while Roger had
to be content with a hundred less. The payment of these annual sums had
given the squire a good deal of trouble; but he thought of it as a merely
temporary inconvenience, perhaps unreasonably thought so. Osborne was to
do great things; take high honours, get a fellowship, marry a long-descended
heiress, live in some of the many uninhabited rooms at the Hall, and help
the squire in the management of the estate that would some time be his.
Roger was to be a clergyman; steady, slow Roger was just fitted for that,
and when he declined entering the Church, preferring a life of more activity
and adventure, Roger was to be - anything; he was useful and practical,
and fit for all the employments from which Osborne was shut out by his
fastidiousness, and his (pseudo) genius; so it was well he was an eldest
son, for he would never have done to struggle through the world; and as
for his settling down to a profession, it would be like cutting blocks
with a razor! And now here was Osborne, living at home, but longing to
be elsewhere; his allowance stopped in reality; indeed the punctual payment
of it during the last year or two had been owing to his mother's exertions;
but nothing had been said about its present cessation by either father
or son: money matters were too sore a subject between them. Every now and
then the squire threw him a ten-pound note or so; but the sort of suppressed
growl with which they were given, and the entire uncertainty as to when
he might receive them, rendered any calculation based upon their receipt
exceedingly vague and uncertain.</DD>

<DD>
'What in the world can I do to secure an income?' thought Osborne, as he
stood on the hearth-rug, his back to a blazing fire, his cup of coffee
sent up in the rare old china that had belonged to the Hall for generations;
his dress finished, as dress of Osborne's could hardly fail to be. One
could hardly have thought that this elegant young man, standing there in
the midst of comfort that verged on luxury, should have been turning over
that one great problem in his mind; but so it was. 'What can I do to be
sure of a present income? Things cannot go on as they are. I should need
support for two or three years, even if I entered myself at the Temple,
or Lincoln's Inn.' It would be impossible for live on my pay in the army;
besides, I should hate that profession. In fact, there are evils attending
all professions - I couldn't bring myself to become a member of any I've
ever heard of. Perhaps I'm more fitted to take orders than anything else,
but to be compelled to write weekly sermons whether one had anything to
say or not, and, probably, doomed only to associate with people below one
in refinement and education! Yet poor Aim&eacute;e must have money. I can't
bear to compare our dinners here, overloaded with joints and game and sweets,
as Morgan will persist in sending them up, with Aim&eacute;e's two little
mutton-chops. Yet what would my father say if he knew I'd married a Frenchwoman?
In his present mood he'd disinherit me, if that is possible; and he'd speak
about her in a way I couldn't stand. A Roman Catholic, too! Well, I don't
repent it. I'd do it again. Only if my mother had been in good health,
if she could have heard my story, and known Aim&eacute;e! As it is, I must
keep it secret; but where to get money? Where to get money?'</DD>

<DD>
Then he bethought him of his poems - would they sell, and bring him in
money? In spite of Milton, he thought they might; and he went to fetch
his MSS. out of his room. He sate down near the fire, trying to study them
with a critical eye, to represent public opinion as far as he could. He
had changed his style since the Mrs Hemans' days. He was essentially imitative
in his poetic faculty; and of late he had followed the lead of a popular
writer of sonnets.' He turned his poems over: they were almost equivalent
to an autobiographical passage in his life. Arranging them in their order,
they came as follows: -</DD>

<DD>
'To Aim&eacute;e, Walking with a Little Child.'</DD>

<DD>
'To Aim&eacute;e, Singing at her Work.'</DD>

<DD>
'To Aim&eacute;e, turning away from me while I told my Love.'</DD>

<DD>
'Aim&eacute;e's Confession.'</DD>

<DD>
'Aim&eacute;e in Despair.'</DD>

<DD>
'The Foreign Land in which my Aim&eacute;e dwells.'</DD>

<DD>
'The Wedding Ring.'</DD>

<DD>
'The Wife.'</DD>

<DD>
When he came to this last sonnet he put down his bundle of papers and began
to think. 'The wife.' Yes, and a French wife. and a Roman Catholic wife
- and a wife who might be said to have been in service! And his father's
hatred of the French, both collectively and individually - collectively,
as tumultuous brutal ruffians, who murdered their king, and committed all
kinds of bloody atrocities: individually, as represented by 'Boney,' and
the various caricatures of 'Johnny Crapaud' that had been in full circulation
about five-and-twenty years before this time - when the squire had been
young and capable of receiving impressions. As for the form of religion
in which Mrs Osborne Hamley had been brought up, it is enough to say that
Catholic emancipation had begun to be talked about by some politicians,
and that the sullen roar of the majority of Englishmen, at the bare idea
of it, was surging in the distance with ominous threatenings; the very
mention of such a measure before the squire was, as Osborne well knew,
like shaking a red flag before a bull.</DD>

<DD>
And then he considered that if Aim&eacute;e had had the unspeakable, the
incomparable blessing of being born of English parents, in the very heart
of England - Warwickshire, for instance - and had never heard of priests,
or mass, or confession, or the Pope, or Guy Fawkes, but had been born,
baptized, and bred in the Church of England, without having ever seen the
outside of a dissenting meeting-house, or a papist chapel - even with all
these advantages, her having been a (what was the equivalent for 'bonne'
in English? 'nursery governess' was a term hardly invented) nursery-maid,
with wages paid down once a quarter, liable to be dismissed at a month's
warning, and having her tea and sugar doled out to her, would be a shock
to his father's old ancestral pride that he would hardly ever get over.</DD>

<DD>
'If he saw her!' thought Osborne. 'If he could but see her!' But if the
squire were to see Aim&eacute;e, he would also hear her speak her pretty
broken English - precious to her husband, as it was in it that she had
confessed brokenly with her English tongue, that she loved him soundly
with her French heart - and Squire Hamley piqued himself on being a good
hater of the French. 'She would make such a loving, sweet, docile little
daughter to my father - she would go as near as any one could towards filling
up the blank void in this house, if he would but have her; but he won't;
he never would; and he shan't have the opportunity of scouting her. Yet
if I called her "Lucy" in these sonnets; and if they made a great effect
- were praised in <I>Blackwood</I> and the <I>Quarterly</I> - and all the
world was agog to find out the author; and I told him my secret - I could
if I were successful - I think then he would ask who Lucy was, and I could
tell him all then. If - how I hate "ifs." "If me no ifs." My life has been
based on "whens;" and first they have turned to "ifs," and then they have
vanished away. It was "when Osborne gets honours," and then "if Osborne,"
and then a failure altogether. I said to Aim&eacute;e, "When my mother
sees you," and now it is "If my father saw her," with a very faint prospect
of its ever coming to pass.' So he let the evening hours flow on and disappear
in reveries like these; winding up with a sudden determination to try the
fate of his poems with a publisher, with the direct expectation of getting
money for them, and an ulterior fancy that, if successful, they might work
wonders with this father.</DD>

<DD>
When Roger came home Osborne did not let a day pass before telling his
brother of his plans. He never did conceal anything long from Roger; the
feminine part of his character made him always desirous of a confidant,
and as sweet sympathy as he could extract. But Roger's opinion had no effect
on Osborne's actions; and Roger knew this full well. So when Osborne began
with - 'I want your advice on a plan I have got in my head,' Roger replied:
'Some one told me that the Duke of Wellington's maxim was never to give
advice unless he could enforce its being carried into effect. now I can't
do that; and you know, old boy, you don't follow out my advice when you've
got it.'</DD>

<DD>
'Not always, I know. Not when it does not agree with my own opinion. You
are thinking about this concealment of my marriage. but you're not up in
all the circumstances. You know how fully I meant to have done it, if there
had not been that row about my debts; and then my mother's illness and
death. And now you've no conception how my father is changed - how irritable
he has become! Wait till you've been at home a week! Robinson, Morgan -
it's the same with them all; but worst of all with me!'</DD>

<DD>
'Poor fellow!' said Roger; 'I thought he looked terribly changed; shrunken,
and his ruddiness of complexion altered.'</DD>

<DD>
'Why, he hardly takes half the exercise he used to do, so it's no wonder.
He has turned away all the men off the new works, which used to be such
an interest to him; and because the roan cob stumbled with him one day,
and nearly threw him, he won't ride it; and yet he won't sell it and buy
another, which would be the sensible plan; so there are two old horses
eating their heads off, while he is constantly talking about money and
expense. And that brings me to what I was going to say. I'm desperately
hard up for money, and so I've been collecting my poems - weeding them
well, you know - going over them quite critically, in fact; and I want
to know if you think Deighton would publish them. You've a name in Cambridge,
you know; and I daresay he would look at them if you offered them to him.'</DD>

<DD>
'I can but try,' said Roger; 'but I'm afraid you won't get much by them.'</DD>

<DD>
'I don't expect much. I'm a new man, and must make my name. I should be
content with a hundred. If I'd a hundred pounds I'd set myself to do something.
I might keep myself and Aim&eacute;e by my writings while I studied for
the bar; or, if the worst came to the worst, a hundred pounds would take
us to Australia.'</DD>

<DD>
'Australia! Why, Osborne, what could you do there? And leave my father!
I hope you'll never get your hundred pounds, if that's the use you're to
make of it! Why, you'd break the squire's heart.'</DD>

<DD>
'It might have done once,' said Osborne, gloomily, 'but it would not now.
He looks at me askance, and shies away from conversation with me. Let me
alone for noticing and feeling this kind of thing. It's this very susceptibility
to outward things that gives me what faculty I have; and it seems to me
as if my bread, and my wife's too, were to depend upon it. You'll soon
see for yourself the terms which I am on with my father!'</DD>

<DD>
Roger did soon see. His father had slipped into a habit of silence at meal
times - a habit which Osborne, who was troubled and anxious enough for
his own part, had not striven to break. Father and son sate together, and
exchanged all the necessary speeches connected with the occasion civilly
enough; but it was a relief to them when their intercourse was over, and
they separated - the father to brood over his sorrow and his disappointment,
which were real and deep enough, and the injury he had received from his
boy, which was exaggerated in his mind by his ignorance of the actual steps
Osborne had taken to raise money. If the money-lenders had calculated the
chances of his father's life or death in making their bargain, Osborne
himself had thought only of how soon and how easily lie could get the money
requisite for clearing him from all imperious claims at Cambridge, and
for enabling him to follow Aim&eacute;e to her home in Alsace, and for
the subsequent marriage. As yet, Roger had never seen his brother's wife;
indeed, he had only been taken into Osborne's full confidence after all
was decided in which his advice could have been useful. And now, in the
enforced separation, Osborne's whole thought, both the poetical and practical
sides of his mind, ran upon the little wife who was passing her lonely
days in farmhouse lodgings, wondering when her bridegroom husband would
come to her next. With such an engrossing subject it was, perhaps, no wonder
that he unconsciously neglected his father; but it was none the less sad
at the time, and to be regretted in its consequences.</DD>

<DD>
'I may come in and have a pipe with you, sir, mayn't I?' said Roger, that
first evening, pushing gently against the study-door, which his father
held only half open.</DD>

<DD>
'You'll not like it,' said the squire, still holding the door against him,
but speaking in a relenting tone. 'The tobacco I use isn't what young men
like. Better go and have a cigar with Osborne.'</DD>

<DD>
'No. I want to sit with you, and I can stand pretty strong tobacco.'</DD>

<DD>
Roger pushed in, the resistance slowly giving way before him.</DD>

<DD>
'It will make your clothes smell. You'll have to borrow Osborne's scents
to sweeten yourself,' said the squire, grimly, at the same time pushing
a short smart amber-mouthed pipe to his son.</DD>

<DD>
'No; I'll have a churchwarden. Why, father, do you think I'm a baby to
put up with a doll's head like this?' looking at the carving upon it.</DD>

<DD>
The squire was pleased in his heart, though he did not choose to show it.
He only said, 'Osborne brought it me when he came back from Germany. That's
three years ago.' And then for some time they smoked in silence. But the
voluntary companionship of his son was very soothing to the squire, though
not a word might be said. The next speech he made showed the direction
of his thoughts; indeed his words were always a transparent medium through
which the current might be seen.</DD>

<DD>
'A deal of a man's life comes and goes in three years - I've found that
out.' And he puffed away at his pipe again. While Roger was turning over
in his mind what answer to make to this truism, the squire again stopped
his smoking and spoke.</DD>

<DD>
'I remember when there was all that fuss about the Prince of Wales being
made Regent, I read somewhere - I daresay it was in a newspaper - that
kings and their heirs-apparent were always on bad terms. Osborne was quite
a little chap then: he used to go out riding with me on White Surrey; you
won't remember the pony we called White Surrey?'</DD>

<DD>
'I remember it; but I thought it a tall horse in those days.'</DD>

<DD>
'Ah! that was because you were such a small lad, you know. I had seven
horses in the stable then - not counting the farm-horses. I don't recollect
having a care then, except - <I>she</I> was always delicate, you know.
But what a beautiful boy Osborne was! He was always dressed in black velvet
- it was a foppery, but it wasn't my doing, and it was all right, I'm sure.
He's a handsome fellow now, but the sunshine has gone out of his face.'</DD>

<DD>
'He's a good deal troubled about this money, and the anxiety he has given
you,' said Roger, rather taking his brother's feelings for granted.</DD>

<DD>
'Not he,' said the squire, taking the pipe out of his mouth, and hitting
the bowl so sharply against the hob that it broke in pieces. 'There! But
never mind! I say, not he, Roger! He's none troubled about the money. It's
easy getting money from Jews if you're the eldest son, and the heir. They
just ask, "How old is your father, and has he had a stroke, or a fit?"
and it's settled out of hand, and then they come prowling about a place,
and running down the timber and land -- Don't let us speak of him; it's
no good, Roger. He and I are out of tune, and it seems to me as if only
God Almighty could put us to rights. It's thinking of how he grieved her
at last that makes me so bitter with him. And yet there's a deal of good
in him! and he's so quick and clever, if only he'd give his mind to things.
Now, you were always slow, Roger - all your masters used to say so.'</DD>

<DD>
Roger laughed a little, -</DD>

<DD>
'Yes; I'd many a nickname at school for my slowness,' said he.</DD>

<DD>
'Never mind!' said the squire, consolingly. 'I'm sure I don't. If you were
a clever fellow like Osborne yonder, you'd be all for caring for books
and writing, and you'd perhaps find it as dull as he does to keep company
with a bumpkin-Squire Jones like me. Yet I daresay they think a deal of
you at Cambridge,' said he, after a pause, 'since you've got this fine
wranglership; I'd nearly forgotten that - the news came at such a miserable
time.'</DD>

<DD>
'Well, yes! They're always proud of the senior wrangler of the year up
at Cambridge. Next year I must abdicate.'</DD>

<DD>
The squire sate and gazed into the embers, still holding his useless pipe-stem.
At last he said, in a low voice, as if scarcely aware he had got a listener,
- 'I used to write to her when she was away in London, and tell her the
home news. But no letter will reach her now! Nothing reaches her!'</DD>

<DD>
Roger started up.</DD>

<DD>
'Where's the tobacco-box, father? Let me fill you another pipe!' and when
he had done so, he stooped over his father and stroked his cheek. The squire
shook his head.</DD>

<DD>
'You've only just come home, lad. You don't know me, as I am now-a-days!
Ask Robinson - I won't have you asking Osborne, he ought to keep it to
himself - but any of the servants will tell you I'm not like the same man
for getting into passions with them. I used to be reckoned a good master,
but that is past now! Osborne was once a little boy, and she was once alive
- and I was once a good master - a good master - yes! It is all past now.'</DD>

<DD>
He took up his pipe, and began to smoke afresh, and Roger, after a silence
of some minutes, began a long story about some Cambridge man's misadventure
on the hunting-field, telling it with such humour that the squire was beguiled
into hearty laughing. When they rose to go to bed, his father said to Roger,
-</DD>

<DD>
'Well, we've had a pleasant evening - at least, I have. But perhaps you
have not; for I'm but poor company now, know.'</DD>

<DD>
'I don't know when I've passed a happier evening, father,' said Roger.
And he spoke truly, though he did not trouble himself to find out the cause
of his happiness.</DD>
