<DD>
The conversation ended there for the time. Wedding-cake and wine were brought
in, and it was Molly's duty to serve them out. But those last words of
Mrs Goodenough's tingled in her ears, and she tried to interpret them to
her own satisfaction in any way but the obvious one. And that, too, was
destined to be confirmed; for directly after Mrs Goodenough took her leave,
Mrs Gibson desired Molly to carry away the tray to a table close to an
open corner window, where the things might be placed in readiness for any
future callers; and underneath this open window went the path from the
house-door to the road. Molly heard Mrs Goodenough saying to her grand-daughter,
-</DD>

<DD>
'That Mrs Gibson is a deep un. There's Mr Roger Hamley as like as not to
have the Hall estate, and she sends Molly a-visiting - ' and then she passed
out of hearing. Molly could have burst out crying, with a full sudden conviction
of what Mrs Goodenough had been alluding to: her sense of the impropriety
of Molly's going to visit at the Hall when Roger was at home. To be sure
Mrs Goodenough was a commonplace, unrefined woman. Mrs Gibson did not seem
to have even noticed the allusion. Mr Gibson took it all as a matter of
course that Molly should go to the Hall as simply now, as she had done
before. Roger had spoken of it in so straightforward a manner as showed
he had no conception of its being an impropriety, - this visit, - this
visit until now so happy a subject of anticipation. Molly felt as if she
could never speak to any one of the idea to which Mrs Goodenough's words
had given rise; as if she could never be the first to suggest the notion
of impropriety, which presupposed what she blushed to think of. Then she
tried to comfort herself by reasoning. If it had been wrong, forward, or
indelicate, really improper in the slightest degree, who would have been
so ready as her father to put his veto upon it? But reasoning was of no
use after Mrs Goodenough's words had put fancies into Molly's head. The
more she bade these fancies begone the more they answered her (as Daniel
O'Rourke did the man in the moon, when he bade Dan get off his seat on
the sickle, and go into empty space), 'The more ye ask us the more we won't
stir.' One may smile at a young girl's miseries of this description; but
they are very real and stinging miseries to her. All that Molly could do
was to resolve on a single eye to the dear old squire, and his mental and
bodily comforts; to try and heal up any breaches which might have occurred
between him and Aim&eacute;e; and to ignore Roger as much as possible.
Good Roger! Kind Roger! Dear Roger! It would be very hard to avoid him
as much as was consistent with common politeness; but it would be right
to do it; and when she was with him she must be as natural as possible,
or he might observe some difference; but what was natural? How much ought
she avoid being with him? Would he ever notice if she was more chary of
her company, more calculating of her words? Alas! the simplicity of their
intercourse was spoilt henceforwards! She made laws for herself; she resolved
to devote herself to the squire and to Aim&eacute;e, and to forget Mrs
Goodenough's foolish speeches; but her perfect freedom was gone; and with
it half her chance, that is to say, half her chance would have been lost
over any strangers who had not known her before: they would probably have
thought her stiff and awkward, and apt to say things and then retract them.
But she was so different from her usual self that Roger noticed the change
in her as soon as she arrived at the Hall. She had carefully measured out
the days of her visit; they were to be exactly the same number as she had
spent at the Towers. She feared lest if she stayed at the Hall a shorter
time the squire might be annoyed. Yet how charming the place looked in
its early autumnal glow as she drove up! And there was Roger at the hall-door
waiting to receive her, watching for her coming. And now he retreated,
apparently to summon his sister-in-law, who came now timidly forwards in
her deep widow's mourning, holding her boy in her arms as if to protect
her shyness; but he struggled down, and ran towards the carriage, eager
to greet his friend the coachman, and to obtain a promised ride. Roger
did not say much himself: he wanted to make Aim&eacute;e feel her place
as daughter of the house; but she was too timid to speak much, And she
only took Molly by the hand and led her into the drawing-room, where, as
if by a sudden impulse of gratitude for all the tender nursing she had
received during her illness, she put her arms round Molly and kissed her
long and well. And after that they came to be friends.</DD>

<DD>
It was nearly lunch-time, and the squire always made his appearance at
that meal, more for the pleasure of seeing his grandson eat his dinner,
than for any hunger of his own. To-day Molly quickly saw the whole state
of the family affairs. She thought that even had Roger said nothing about
them at the Towers, she should have found out that neither the father nor
the daughter-in-law had as yet found the clue to each other's characters,
although they had now been living for several months in the same house.
Aim&eacute;e seemed to forget her English in her nervousness; and to watch
with the jealous eyes of a dissatisfied mother all the proceedings of the
squire towards her little boy. They were not of the wisest kind it must
be owned; the child sipped the strong ale with evident relish, and clamoured
for everything which he saw the others enjoying. Aim&eacute;e could hardly
attend to Molly for her anxiety as to what her boy was doing and eating;
yet she said nothing. Roger took the end of the table opposite to that
at which sate grandfather and grandchild. After the boy's first wants were
gratified the squire addressed himself to Molly.</DD>

<DD>
'Well! and so you can come here a-visiting though you have been among the
grand folks. I thought you were going to cut us, Miss Molly, when I heard
you was gone to the Towers - could not find any other place to stay at
while father and mother were away, but an earl's, eh?'</DD>

<DD>
'They asked me, and I went,' said Molly; 'now you've asked me, and I've
come here.'</DD>

<DD>
'I think you might ha' known you'd be always welcome here, without waiting
for asking. Why, Molly! I look upon you as a kind of a daughter more than
Madam there!' dropping his voice a little, and perhaps supposing that the
child's babble would drown the signification of his words. - 'Nay, you
need not look at me so pitifully - she does not follow English readily.'</DD>

<DD>
'I think she does!' said Molly, in a low voice, not looking up, however,
for fear of catching another glimpse at Aim&eacute;e's sudden forlornness
of expression and deepened colour. She felt grateful, as if for a personal
favour, when she heard Roger speaking to Aim&eacute;e the moment afterwards
in the tender tones of brotherly friendliness; and presently these two
were sufficiently engaged in a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te conversation
to allow Molly and the squire to go on talking.</DD>

<DD>
'He's sturdy chap, is not he?' said the squire, stroking the little Roger's
curly head. 'And he can puff four puffs at grandpapa's pipe without being
sick, can't he?'</DD>

<DD>
'I s'ant puff any more puffs,' said the boy, resolutely. 'Mamma says no.
I s'ant.'</DD>

<DD>
'That's just like her!' said the squire, dropping his voice this time however.
'As if it could do the child any harm!'</DD>

<DD>
Molly made a point of turning the conversation from all personal subjects
after this, and kept the squire talking about the progress of his drainage
during the rest of lunch. He offered to take her to see it; and she acceded
to the proposal, thinking, meantime, how little she need have anticipated
the being thrown too intimately with Roger, who seemed to devote himself
to his sister-in-law. But, in the evening, when Aim&eacute;e had gone upstairs
to put her boy to bed, and the squire was asleep in his easy chair, a sudden
flush of memory brought Mrs Goodenough's words again to her mind. She was
virtually t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te with Roger, as she had been dozens
of times before, but now she could not help assuming an air of constraint:
her eyes did not meet his in the old frank way; she took up a book at a
pause in the conversation, and left him puzzled and annoyed at the change
in her manner. And so it went on during all the time of her visit. If sometimes
she forgot and let herself go into all her old naturalness, by-and-by she
checked herself, and became comparatively cold and reserved. Roger was
pained at all this - more pained day after day; more anxious to discover
the cause. Aim&eacute;e, too, silently noticed how different Molly became
in Roger's presence. One day she could not help saying to Molly, -</DD>

<DD>
'Don't you like Roger? You would if you only knew how good he was! He is
learned, but that is nothing: it is his goodness that one admires and loves.'</DD>

<DD>
'He is very good,' said Molly. 'I have known him long enough to know that.'</DD>

<DD>
'But you don't think him agreeable? He is not like my poor husband, to
be sure; and you knew him well, too. Ah! tell me about him once again.
When you first knew him? When his mother was alive?'</DD>

<DD>
Molly had grown very fond of Aim&eacute;e: when the latter was at her case
she had very charming and attaching ways; but feeling uneasy in her position
in the squire's house, she was almost repellent to him; and he, too, put
on his worst side to her. Roger was most anxious to bring them together,
and had several consultations with Molly as to the best means of accomplishing
this end. As long as they talked upon this subject she spoke to him in
the quiet sensible manner which she inherited from her father; but when
their discussions on this point were ended, she fell back into her piquant
assumption of dignified reserve. It was very difficult to her to maintain
this strange manner, especially when once or twice she fancied that it
gave him pain; and she would go into her own room and suddenly burst into
tears on these occasions, and wish that her visit was ended, and that she
was once again in the eventless tranquillity of her own home. Yet presently
her fancy changed, and she clung to the swiftly passing hours, as if she
would still retain the happiness of each. For, unknown to her, Roger was
exerting himself to make her visit pleasant. He was not willing to appear
as the instigator of all the little plans for each day, for he felt as
if somehow he did not hold the same place in her regard as formerly. Still,
one day Aim&eacute;e suggested a nutting expedition - another day they
gave little Roger the unheard-of pleasure of tea out-of-doors - there was
something else agreeable for a third; and it was Roger who arranged all
these simple pleasures - such as he knew Molly would enjoy. But to her
he only appeared as the ready forwarder of Aim&eacute;e's devices. The
week was nearly gone, when one morning the squire found Roger sitting in
the old library - with a book before him, it is true, but so deep in thought
that he was evidently startled by his father's unexpected entrance.</DD>

<DD>
'I thought I should find thee here, my lad! We'll have the old room done
up again before winter; it smells musty enough, and yet I see it's the
place for thee! I want thee to go with me round the five-acre. I'm thinking
of laying it down in grass. It's time for you to be getting into the fresh
air, you look quite woebegone over books, books, books; there never was
a thing like 'em for stealing a man's health out of him!'</DD>

<DD>
So Roger went out with his father, without saying many words till they
were at some distance from the house. Then he brought out a sentence with
such abruptness that he repaid his father for the start the latter had
given him a quarter of an hour before.</DD>

<DD>
'Father, you remember I'm going out again to the Cape next month! You spoke
of doing up the library. If it is for me, I shall be away all the winter.'</DD>

<DD>
'Can't you get off it?' pleaded his father. 'I thought maybe you'd forgotten
all about it - '</DD>

<DD>
'Not likely!' said Roger, half-smiling.</DD>

<DD>
'Well, but they might have found another man to finish up your work.'</DD>

<DD>
'No one can finish it but myself. Besides, an engagement is an engagement.
When I wrote to Lord Hollingford to tell him I must come home, I promised
to go out again for another six months.'</DD>

<DD>
'Ay. I know. And perhaps it will put it out of thy mind. It will always
be hard on me to part from thee. But I daresay it's best for you.'</DD>

<DD>
Roger's colour deepened. 'You are alluding to - to Miss Kirkpatrick - Mrs
Henderson, I mean. Father, let me tell you once for all I think that was
rather a hasty affair. I am pretty sure now that we were not suited to
each other. I was wretched when I got her letter - at the Cape I mean -
but I believe it was for the best.'</DD>

<DD>
'That's right. That's my own boy,' said the squire, turning round and shaking
hands with his son with vehemence. 'And now I'll tell you what I heard
the other day, when I was at the magistrates' meeting. They were all saying
she had jilted Preston.'</DD>

<DD>
'I don't want to hear anything against her: she may have her faults, but
I can never forget how I once loved her.'</DD>

<DD>
'Well, well! Perhaps it's right. I was not so bad about it, was I, Roger?
Poor Osborne need not ha' been so secret with me. I asked your Miss Cynthia
out here - and her mother and all - my bark is worse than my bite. For
if I had a wish on earth it was to see Osborne married as befitted one
of an old stock, and he went and chose out this French girl, of no family
at all, only a -- '</DD>

<DD>
'Never mind what she was; look at what she is! I wonder you are not more
taken with her humility and sweetness, father!'</DD>

<DD>
'I don't even call her pretty,' said the squire, uneasily, for he dreaded
a repetition of the arguments which Roger had often used to make him give
Aim&eacute;e her proper due of affection and position. 'Now your Miss Cynthia
was pretty, I will say that for her, the baggage! and to think that when
you two lads flew right in your father's face, and picked out girls below
you in rank and family, you should neither of you have set your fancies
on my little Molly there. I daresay I should ha' been angry enough at the
time, but the lassie would ha' found her way to my heart, as never this
French lady, nor t' other one, could ha' done.'</DD>

<DD>
Roger did not answer.</DD>

<DD>
'I don't see why you might not put up for her still. I'm humble enough
now, and you're not heir as Osborne was who married a servant-maid. Don't
you think you could turn your thoughts upon Molly Gibson, Roger.'</DD>

<DD>
'No!' said Roger, shortly. 'It's too late - too late. Don't let us talk
any more of my marrying. Is not this the five-acre field?' And soon he
was discussing the relative values of meadow, arable and pasture land with
his father, as heartily as if he had never known Molly, or loved Cynthia.
But the squire was not in such good spirits, and went but heavily into
the discussion. At the end of it he said <I>&agrave;propos de bottes</I>,
-</DD>

<DD>
'But don't you think you could like her if you tried, Roger?'</DD>

<DD>
Roger knew perfectly well to what his father was alluding, but for an instant
he was on the point of pretending to misunderstand. At length, however,
he said, in a low voice, -</DD>

<DD>
'I shall never try, father. Don't let us talk any more about it. As I said
before, it is too late.'</DD>

<DD>
The squire was like a child to whom some toy has been refused; from time
to time the thought of his disappointment in this matter recurred to his
mind; and then he took to blaming Cynthia as the primary cause of Roger's
present indifference to womankind.</DD>

<DD>
It so happened that on Molly's last morning at the Hall, she received her
first letter from Cynthia - Mrs Henderson. It was just before breakfast-time:
Roger was out of doors, Aim&eacute;e had not as yet come down; Molly was
alone in the dining-room, where the table was already laid. She had just
finished reading her letter when the squire came in, and she immediately
and joyfully told him what the morning had brought to her. But when she
saw the squire's face she could have bitten her tongue out for having named
Cynthia's name to him. He looked vexed and depressed.</DD>

<DD>
'I wish I might never hear of her again. I do. She's been the bane of my
Roger, that's what she has. I have not slept half the night, and it's all
her fault. Why, there's my boy saying now that he has no heart for ever
marrying, poor lad! I wish it had been you, Molly, my lads had taken a
fancy for. I told Roger so t'other day, and I said that for all you were
beneath what I ever thought to see them marry, - well - it's of no use
- it's too late, now, as he said. Only never let me hear that baggage's
name again, that's all. And no offence to you, either, lassie. I know you
love the wench; but if you'll take an old man's word, you're worth a score
of her. I wish young men would think so too,' he muttered as he went to
the side-table to carve the ham, while Molly poured out the tea - her heart
very hot all the time, and effectually silenced for a space. It was with
the greatest difficulty that she could keep tears of mortification from
falling. She felt altogether in a wrong position in that house, which had
been like a home to her until this last visit. What with Mrs Goodenough's
remarks, and now this speech of the squire's, implying - at least to her
susceptible imagination - that his father had proposed her as a wife to
Roger, and that she had been rejected, she was more glad than she could
express, or even think, that she was going home this very morning. Roger
came in from his walk while she was in this state of feeling. He saw in
an instant that something had distressed Molly; and he longed to have the
old friendly right of asking her what it was. But she had effectually kept
him at too great a distance during the last few days for him to feel at
liberty to speak to her in the old straightforward brotherly way; especially
now, when he perceived her efforts to conceal her feelings, and the way
in which she drank her tea in feverish haste, and accepted bread only to
crumble it about her plate, untouched. It was all that he could do to make
talk under these circumstances; but he backed up her efforts as well as
he could until Aim&eacute;e came down, grave and anxious; her boy had not
had a good night, and did not seem well; he had fallen into a feverish
sleep now, or she could not have left him. Immediately the whole table
was in a ferment. The squire pushed away his plate, and could cat no more;
Roger was trying to extract a detail or a fact out of Aim&eacute;e, who
began to give way to tears. Molly quickly proposed that the carriage, which
had been ordered to take her home at eleven, should come round immediately
- she had everything ready packed up, she said, - and bring back her father
at once. By leaving directly, she said it was probable they might catch
him after he had returned from his morning visits in the town, and before
he had set off on his more distant round. Her proposal was agreed to, and
she went upstairs to put on her things. She came down all ready into the
drawing-room, expecting to find Aim&eacute;e and the squire there; but
during her absence word had been brought to the anxious mother and grandfather
that the child had wakened up in a panic, and both had rushed up to their
darling. But Roger was in the drawing-room awaiting Molly, with a large
bunch of the choicest flowers.</DD>

<DD>
'Look, Molly!' said he, as she was on the point of leaving the room again,
on finding him there alone. 'I gathered these flowers for you before breakfast.'
He came to meet her reluctant advance.</DD>

<DD>
'Thank you!' said she. 'You are very kind. I am very much obliged to you.'</DD>

<DD>
'Then you must do something for me,' said he, determined not to notice
the restraint of her manner, and making the rearrangement of the flowers
which she held a sort of link between them, so that she could not follow
her impulse, and leave the room. - 'Tell me, - honestly as I know you will
if you speak at all, - have not I done something to vex you since we were
so happy at the Towers together?'</DD>

<DD>
His voice was so kind and true, - his manner so winning yet wistful, that
Molly would have been thankful to tell him all; she believed that he could
have helped her more than any one to understand how she ought to behave
rightly; he would have disentangled her fancies, - if only he himself had
not lain at the very core and centre of all her perplexity and dismay.
How could she tell him of Mrs Goodenough's words troubling her maiden modesty?
How could she ever repeat what his father had said that morning, and assure
him that she, no more than he, wished that their old friendliness should
be troubled by the thought of a nearer relationship?</DD>

<DD>
'No, you never vexed me in my whole life, Roger,' said she, looking straight
at him for the first time for many days.</DD>

<DD>
'I believe you, because you say so. I have no right to ask further. Molly,
will you give me back one of those flowers, as a pledge of what you have
said?'</DD>

<DD>
'Take whichever you like,' said she, eagerly offering him the whole nosegay
to choose from.</DD>

<DD>
'No; you must choose, and you must give it me.'</DD>

<DD>
Just then the squire came in. Roger would have been glad if Molly had not
gone on so eagerly to ransack the bunch for the choicest flower in his
father's presence; but she exclaimed, -</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, please, Mr Hamley, do you know which is Roger's favourite flower?'</DD>

<DD>
'No. A rose, I daresay. The carriage is at the door, and, Molly my dear,
I don't want to hurry you, but -- '</DD>

<DD>
'I know. Here, Roger, - here is a rose!</DD>

<CENTER>
<DD>
('And red as a rose was she.')</DD></CENTER>

<DD>
I will find papa as soon as ever I get home. How is the little boy?'</DD>

<DD>
'I'm afraid he's beginning of some kind of a fever.'</DD>

<DD>
And the squire took her to the carriage, talking all the way of the little
boy; Roger following, and hardly heeding what he was doing in the answer
to the question he kept asking himself: 'Too late - or not? Can she ever
forget that my first foolish love was given to one so different?'</DD>

<DD>
While she, as the carriage rolled away, kept saying to herself, - 'We are
friends again. I don't believe he will remember what the dear squire took
it into his head to suggest, for many days. It is so pleasant to be on
the old terms again; and what lovely flowers!'</DD>
