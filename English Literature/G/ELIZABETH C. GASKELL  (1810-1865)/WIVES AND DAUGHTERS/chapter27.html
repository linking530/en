<DD>
Things were not going on any better at Hamley Hall. Nothing had occurred
to change the state of dissatisfied feeling into which the squire and his
eldest son had respectively fallen; and the long continuance merely of
dissatisfaction is sure of itself to deepen the feeling, Roger did all
in his power to bring the father and son together; but sometimes wondered
if it would not have been better to leave them alone; for they were falling
into the habit of respectively making him their confidant, and so defining
emotions and opinions which would have had less distinctness if they had
been unexpressed. There was little enough relief in the daily life at the
Hall to help them all to shake off the gloom; and it even told on the health
of both the squire and Osborne. The squire became thinner, his skin as
well as his clothes began to hang loose about him, and the freshness of
his colour turned to red streaks, till his cheeks looked like Eardiston
pippins, instead of resembling 'a Katherine pear on the side that's next
the sun.' Roger thought that his father sate indoors and smoked in his
study more than was good for him, but it had become difficult to get him
far afield; he was too much afraid of coming across some sign of the discontinued
drainage works, or being irritated afresh by the sight of his depreciated
timber. Osborne was wrapt up in the idea of arranging his poems for the
press, and so working out his wish for independence. What with daily writing
to his wife - taking his letters himself to a distant post-office, and
receiving hers there - touching up his sonnets, &amp;c., with fastidious
care; and occasionally giving himself the pleasure of a visit to the Gibsons,
and enjoying the society of the two pleasant girls there, he found little
time for being with his father. Indeed Osborne was too self-indulgent or
'sensitive,' as he termed it, to bear well with the squire's gloomy fits,
or too frequent querulousness. The consciousness of his secret, too, made
Osborne uncomfortable in his father's presence. It was very well for all
parties that Roger was not 'sensitive.' for, if he had been, there were
times when it would have been hard to bear little spurts of domestic tyranny,
by which his father strove to assert his power over both his sons. One
of these occurred very soon after the night of the Hollingford charity-ball.</DD>

<DD>
Roger had induced his father to come out with him; and the squire had,
on his son's suggestion, taken with him his long unused spud. The two had
wandered far afield; perhaps the elder man had found the unwonted length
of exercise too much for him, for, as he approached the house, on his return,
he became what nurses call in children 'fractious,' and ready to turn on
his companion for every remark he made. Roger understood the case by instinct,
as it were, and bore it all with his usual sweetness of temper. They entered
the house by the front door; it lay straight on their line of march. On
the old cracked yellow-marble slab, there lay a card with Lord Hollingford's
name on it, which Robinson, evidently on the watch for their return, hastened
out of his pantry to deliver to Roger.</DD>

<DD>
'His lordship was very sorry not to see you, Mr Roger, and his lordship
left a note for you. Mr Osborne took it, I think, when he passed through,
I asked his lordship if he would like to see Mr Osborne, who was indoors,
as I thought. But his lordship said he was pressed for time, and told me
to make his excuses.'</DD>

<DD>
'Didn't he ask for me?' growled the squire.</DD>

<DD>
'No, sir; I can't say as his lordship did. He would never have thought
of Mr Osborne, sir, if I hadn't named him. It was Mr Roger he seemed so
keen after.'</DD>

<DD>
'Very odd,' said the squire. Roger said nothing, although he naturally
felt some curiosity. He went into the drawing-room, not quite aware that
his father was following him. Osborne sate at a table near the fire, pen
in hand, looking over one of his poems, and dotting the <I>i's</I>, crossing
the <I>t's</I>, and now and then pausing over the alteration of a word.</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, Roger!' he said, as his brother came in, 'here's been Lord Hollingford
wanting to see you.'</DD>

<DD>
'I know,' replied Roger.</DD>

<DD>
'And he's left a note for you. Robinson tried to persuade him it was for
my father, so he's added a "junior" (Roger Hamley, Esq., junior) in pencil.'
The squire was in the room by this time, and what he had overheard rubbed
him up still more the wrong way. Roger took his unopened note and read
it.</DD>

<DD>
'What does he say?' asked the squire.</DD>

<DD>
Roger handed him the note. It contained an invitation to dinner to meet
M. Geoffroi St H - ,' whose views on certain subjects Roger had been advocating
in the article Lord Hollingford had spoken about to Molly, when he danced
with her at the Hollingford ball. M. Geoffroi St H - was in England now,
and was expected to pay a visit at the Towers in the course of the following
week. He had expressed a wish to meet the author of the paper which had
already attracted the attention of the French comparative anatomists; and
Lord Hollingford added a few words as to his own desire to make the acquaintance
of a neighbour whose tastes were so similar to his own; and then followed
a civil message from Lord and Lady Cumnor.</DD>

<DD>
Lord Hollingford's hand was cramped and rather illegible. The squire could
not read it all at once, and was enough put out to decline any assistance
in deciphering it. At last he made it out.</DD>

<DD>
'So my lord lieutenant is taking some notice of the Hamleys at last. The
election is coming on, is it? But I can tell him we're not to be got so
easily. I suppose this trap is set for you, Osborne? What's this you've
been writing that the French <I>mounseer</I> is so taken with?'</DD>

<DD>
'It is not me, sir!' said Osborne. 'Both note and call are for Roger.'</DD>

<DD>
'I don't understand it,' said the squire. 'These Whig fellows have never
done their duty by me; not that I want it of them. The Duke of Debenham
used to pay the Hamleys a respect due to 'em - the oldest landowners in
the county - but since he died, and this shabby Whig lord has succeeded
him, I've never dined at the lord lieutenant's once - no, not once.'</DD>

<DD>
'But I think, sir, I've heard you say Lord Cumnor used to invite you, -
only you did not choose to go,' said Roger.</DD>

<DD>
'Yes. What d'ye mean by that? Do you suppose I was going to desert the
principles of my family, and curry favour of the Whigs? No! leave that
to them. They can ask the heir of the Hamleys fast enough when a county
election is coming on.'</DD>

<DD>
'I tell you, sir,' said Osborne, in the irritable tone he sometimes used
when his father was particularly unreasonable, 'it is not me Lord Hollingford
is inviting; it is Roger. Roger is making himself known for what he is,
a first-rate fellow,' continued Osborne - a sting of self-reproach mingling
with his generous pride in his brother - 'and he is getting himself a name;
he's been writing about these new French theories and discoveries, and
this foreign savant very naturally wants to make his acquaintance, and
so Lord Hollingford asks him to dine. It's as clear as can be,' lowering
his tone, and addressing himself to Roger, 'it has nothing to do with politics,
if my father would but see it.'</DD>

<DD>
Of course the squire heard this little aside with the unlucky uncertainty
of hearing which is a characteristic of the beginning of deafness; and
its effect on him was perceptible in the increased acrimony of his next
speech.</DD>

<DD>
'You young men think you know everything. I tell you it's a palpable Whig
trick. And what business has Roger - if it is Roger the man wants - to
go currying favour with the French? In my day we were content to hate 'em
and to lick 'em. But it's just like your conceit, Osborne, setting yourself
up to say it's your younger brother they're asking, and not you; I tell
you it's you. They think the eldest son was sure to be called after his
father, Roger - Roger Hamley, junior. It's as plain as a pike-staff. They
know they can't catch me with chaff, but they've got up this French dodge.
What business had you to go writing about the French, Roger? I should have
thought you were too sensible to take any notice of their fancies and theories;
but if it is you they've asked, I'll not have you going and meeting these
foreigners at a Whig house. They ought to have asked Osborne. He's the
representative of the Hamleys, if I'm not; and they can't get me, let them
try ever so. Besides, Osborne has got a bit of the <I>mounseer</I> about
him, which he caught with being so fond of going off to the Continent,
instead of coming back to his good old English home.'</DD>

<DD>
He went on, repeating much of what he had said before, till he left the
room. Osborne had kept on replying to his unreasonable grumblings, which
had only added to his anger; and as soon as the squire had fairly gone,
Osborne turned to Roger, and said, -</DD>

<DD>
'Of course you'll go, Roger? ten to one he'll be in another mind to-morrow.'</DD>

<DD>
'No,' said Roger, bluntly enough - for he was extremely disappointed; 'I
won't run the chance of vexing him. I shall refuse.'</DD>

<DD>
'Don't be such a fool!' exclaimed Osborne. 'Really, my father is too unreasonable.
You heard how he kept contradicting himself; and such a man as you to be
kept under like a child by -- '</DD>

<DD>
'Don't let us talk any more about it, Osborne,' said Roger, writing away
fast. When the note was written, and sent off, he came and put his hand
caressingly on Osborne's shoulder, as he sate pretending to read, but in
reality vexed with both his father and his brother, though on very different
grounds.</DD>

<DD>
'How go the poems, old fellow? I hope they're nearly ready to bring out.'</DD>

<DD>
'No, they're not; and if it were not for the money, I shouldn't care if
they were never published. What's the use of fame, if one mayn't reap the
fruits of it?'</DD>

<DD>
'Come, now, we'll have no more of that; let's talk about the money. I shall
be going up for my fellowship examination next week, and then we'll have
a purse in common, for they'll never think of not giving me a fellowship
now I'm senior wrangler. I'm short enough myself at present, and I don't
like to bother my father; but when I'm Fellow, you shall take me down to
Winchester, and introduce me to the little wife.'</DD>

<DD>
'It will be a month next Monday since I left her,' said Osborne, laying
down his papers and gazing into the fire, as if by so doing he could call
up her image. 'In her letter this morning she bids me give you such a pretty
message. It won't bear translating into English; you must read it for yourself,'
continued he, pointing out a line or two in a letter he drew out of his
pocket.</DD>

<DD>
Roger suspected that one or two of the words were wrongly spelt; but their
purport was so gentle and loving, and had such a touch of simple, respectful
gratitude in them, that he could not help being drawn afresh to the little
unseen sister-in-law, whose acquaintance Osborne had made by helping her
to look for some missing article of the children's, whom she was taking
for their daily walk in Hyde Park. For Mrs Osborne Hamley had been nothing
more than a French <I>bonne</I>, very pretty, very graceful, and very much
tyrannized over by the rough little boys and girls she had in charge. She
was a little orphan-girl, who had charmed the heads of a travelling English
family, as she had brought <I>madame</I> some articles of <I>lingerie</I>
at an hotel; and she had been hastily engaged by them as bonne to their
children, partly as a pet and plaything herself, partly because it would
be so good for the children to learn French from a native (of Alsace!).
By and by her mistress ceased to take any particular notice of Aim&eacute;e
in the bustle of London and London gaiety; but though feeling more and
more forlorn in a strange land every day, the French girl strove hard to
do her duty. One touch of kindness, however, was enough to set the fountain
gushing; and she and Osborne naturally fell into an ideal state of love,
to be rudely disturbed by the indignation of the mother, when accident
discovered to her the attachment existing between her children's <I>bonne</I>
and a young man of an entirely different class. Aim&eacute;e answered truly
to all her mistress's questions; but no worldly wisdom, nor any lesson
to be learnt from another's experience, could in the least disturb her
entire faith in her lover. Perhaps Mrs Townshend did no more than her duty
in immediately sending Aim&eacute;e back to Metz, where she had first met
with her, and where such relations as remained to the girl might be supposed
to be residing. But, altogether, she knew so little of the kind of people
or life to which she was consigning her deposed protegee that Osborne,
after listening with impatient indignation to the lecture which Mrs Townshend
gave him when he insisted on seeing her in order to learn what had become
of his love, that the young man set off straight for Metz in hot haste,
and did not let the grass grow under his feet until he had made Aim&eacute;e
his wife. All this had occurred the previous autumn, and Roger did not
know of the step his brother had taken until it was irrevocable. Then came
the mother's death, which, besides the simplicity of its own overwhelming
sorrow, brought with it the loss of the kind, tender mediatrix, who could
always soften and turn his father's heart. It is doubtful, however, if
even she could have succeeded in this, for the squire looked high, and
over high, for the wife of his heir; he detested all foreigners, and moreover
held all Roman Catholics in dread and abomination something akin to our
ancestors' hatred of witchcraft. All these prejudices were strengthened
by his grief. Argument would always have glanced harmless away off his
shield of utter unreason; but a loving impulse, in a happy moment, might
have softened his heart to what he most detested in the former days. But
the happy moments came not now, and the loving impulses were trodden down
by the bitterness of his frequent remorse, not less than by his growing
irritability; so Aim&eacute;e lived solitary in the little cottage near
Winchester in which Osborne had installed her when she first came to England
as his wife, and in the dainty furnishing of which he had run himself so
deeply into debt. For Osborne consulted his own fastidious taste in his
purchases rather than her simple childlike wishes and wants, and looked
upon the little Frenchwoman rather as the future mistress of Hamley Hall
than as the wife of a man who was wholly dependent on others at present.
He had chosen a southern county as being far removed from those midland
shires where the name of Hamley of Hamley was well and widely known; for
he did not wish his wife to assume, if only for a time, a name which was
not justly and legally her own. In all these arrangements he had willingly
striven to do his full duty by her; and she repaid him with passionate
devotion and admiring reverence. If his vanity had met with a check, or
his worthy desires for college honours had been disappointed, he knew where
to go for a comforter; one who poured out praise till her words were choked
in her throat by the rapidity of her thoughts, and who poured out the small
vials of her indignation on every one who did not acknowledge and bow down
to her husband's merits. If she ever wished to go to the <I>ch&acirc;teau</I>
- that was his home - and to be introduced to his family, Aim&eacute;e
never hinted a word of it to him. Only she did yearn, and she did plead,
for a little more of her husband's company; and the good reasons which
had convinced her of the necessity of his being so much away when he was
present to urge them, failed in their efficacy when she tried to reproduce
them to herself in his absence.</DD>

<DD>
The afternoon of the day on which Lord Hollingford had called, Roger was
going upstairs, three steps at a time, when, at a turn on the landing,
he encountered his father. It was the first time he had seen him since
their conversation about the Towers' invitation to dinner. The squire stopped
his son by standing right in the middle of the passage.</DD>

<DD>
'Thou'rt going to meet the <I>mounseer</I>, my lad?' said he, half as affirmation,
half as question.</DD>

<DD>
'No, sir; I sent off James almost immediately with a note declining it.
I don't care about it - that's to say, not to signify.'</DD>

<DD>
'Why did you take me up so sharp, Roger?' said his father pettishly. 'You
all take me up so hastily now-a-days. I think it's hard when a man mustn't
be allowed a bit of crossness when he's tired and heavy at heart - that
I do.'</DD>

<DD>
'But, father, I should never like to go to a house where they had slighted
you.'</DD>

<DD>
'Nay, nay, lad,' said the squire, brightening up a little; 'I think I slighted
them. They asked me to dinner after my lord was made lieutenant time after
time, but I never would go near 'em. I call that my slighting them.'</DD>

<DD>
And no more was said at the time; but the next day the squire again stopped
Roger.</DD>

<DD>
'I've been making Jem try on his livery-coat that he hasn't worn this three
or four years, - he's got too stout for it now.'</DD>

<DD>
'Well, he needn't wear it, need he? and Morgan's lad will be glad enough
of it, - he's sadly in want of clothes.'</DD>

<DD>
'Ay, ay; but who's to go with you when you call at the Towers? It's but
polite to call after Lord What's-his-name has taken the trouble to come
here; and I shouldn't like you to go without a groom.'</DD>

<DD>
'My dear father! I shouldn't know what to do with a man riding at my back.
I can find my way to the stable-yard for myself, or there'll be some man
about to take my horse. Don't trouble yourself about that.'</DD>

<DD>
'Well, you're not Osborne, to be sure. Perhaps it won't strike 'em as strange
for you. But you must look up, and hold your own, and remember you're one
of the Hamleys, who've been on the same land for hundreds of years, while
they're but trumpery Whig folk who only came into the county in Queen Anne's
time.'</DD>
