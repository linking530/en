<DD>
Robinson opened the door for Molly almost before the carriage had fairly
drawn up at the Hall, and told her that the squire had been very anxious
for her return, and had more than once sent him to an upstairs window,
from which a glimpse of the hill-road between Hollingford and Hamley could
be perceived, to know if the carriage was not yet in sight. Molly went
into the drawing-room. The squire was standing in the middle of the floor,
awaiting her; in fact, longing to go out and meet her, but restrained by
a feeling of solemn etiquette, which prevented his moving about as usual
in that house of mourning. He held a paper in his hands, which were trembling
with excitement and emotion; and four or five open letters were strewed
on a table near him.</DD>

<DD>
'It's all true,' he began; 'she's his wife, and he's her husband - was
her husband - that's the word for it - was! Poor lad! poor lad! it's cost
him a deal. Pray God, it was not my fault. Read this, my dear. It's a certificate.
It's all regular - Osborne Hamley to Marie-Aim&eacute;e Scherer, - parish-church
and all, and witnessed. Oh, dear!' He sate down in the nearest chair and
groaned. Molly took a seat by him, and read the legal paper, the perusal
of which was not needed to convince her of the fact of the marriage. She
held it in her hand after she had finished reading it, waiting for the
squire's next coherent words; for he kept talking to himself in broken
sentences. 'Ay, ay! that comes o' temper, and crabbedness. She was the
only one as could - and I've been worse since she was gone. Worse! worse!
and see what it has come to. He was afraid of me - ay - afraid. That's
the truth of it - afraid. And it made him keep all to himself, and care
killed him. They may call it heart-disease - O my lad, my lad, I know better
now; but it's too late - that's the sting of it - too late, too late!'
He covered his face, and moved himself backwards and forwards till Molly
could bear it no longer.</DD>

<DD>
'There are some letters,' said she: 'may I read any of them?' At another
time she would not have asked; but she was driven to it now by her impatience
of the speechless grief of the old man.</DD>

<DD>
'Ay, read 'em, read 'em,' said he. 'Maybe you can. I can only pick out
a word here and there. I put 'em there for you to look at; and tell me
what is in 'em.'</DD>

<DD>
Molly's knowledge of written French of the present day was not so great
as her knowledge of the French of the <I>M&eacute;moires de Sully</I>,
and neither the spelling nor the writing of the letters was of the best;
but she managed to translate into good enough colloquial English some innocent
sentences of love, and submission to Osborne's will - as if his judgment
was infallible, - and faith in his purposes; - little sentences in 'little
language' that went home to the squire's heart. Perhaps if Molly had read
French more easily she might not have translated them into such touching,
homely, broken words. Here and there, there were expressions in English;
these the hungry-hearted squire had read while waiting for Molly's return.
Every time she stopped, he said, 'Go on.' He kept his face shaded, and
only repeated those two words at every pause. She got up to find some more
of Aim&eacute;e's letters. In examining the papers, she came upon one in
particular. 'Have you seen this, sir? This certificate of baptism' (reading
aloud) 'of Roger Stephen Osborne Hamley, born June 21, 183-, child of Osborne
Hamley and Marie-Aim&eacute;e his wife - '</DD>

<DD>
'Give it me,' said the squire, his voice breaking now, and stretching forth
his eager hand. '"Roger," that's me, "Stephen," that's my poor old father:
he died when he was not so old as I am; but I've always thought on him
as very old. He was main and fond of Osborne, when he was quite a little
one. It's good of the lad to have thought on my father Stephen. Ay! that
was his name. And Osborne - Osborne Hamley! One Osborne Hamley lies dead
on his bed - and t'other - t'other I have never seen, and never heard on
till to-day. He must be called Osborne: Molly. There is a Roger - there's
two for that matter; but one is a good-for-nothing old man; and there's
never an Osborne any more, unless this little thing is called Osborne:
we'll take him here, and get a nurse for him; and make his mother comfortable
for life in her own country. I'll keep this, Molly. You're a good lass
for finding it. Osborne Hamley! And if God will give me grace, he shall
never hear a cross word from me - never. He shan't be afeard of me. Oh,
<I>my</I> Osborne, <I>my</I> Osborne' (he burst out), 'do you know now
how bitter and sore is my heart for every hard word as I ever spoke to
you? Do you know now how I loved you - my boy - my boy?'</DD>

<DD>
From the general tone of the letters Molly doubted if the mother would
consent, so easily as the squire seemed to expect, to be parted from her
child; the letters were not very wise, perhaps (though of this Molly never
thought), but a heart full of love spoke tender words in every line. Still,
it was not for Molly to talk of this doubt of hers just then; rather to
dwell on the probable graces and charms of the little Roger Stephen Osborne
Hamley. She let the squire exhaust himself in wondering as to the particulars
of every event, helping him out in conjectures; and both of them, from
their imperfect knowledge of possibilities, made the most curious, fantastic,
and improbable guesses at the truth. And so that day passed over, and the
night came.</DD>

<DD>
There were not many people who had any right to be invited to the funeral,
and of these Mr Gibson and the squire's hereditary man of business had
taken charge. But when Mr Gibson came, early on the following morning,
Molly referred the question to him, which had suggested itself to her mind,
though apparently not to the squire's. What intimation of her loss should
be sent to the widow, living solitary near Winchester, watching and waiting,
if not for his coming who lay dead in his distant home, at least for his
letters? A letter had already come in her foreign handwriting to the post-office
to which all her communications were usually sent, but of course they at
the Hall knew nothing of this.</DD>

<DD>
'She must be told!' said Mr Gibson, musing.</DD>

<DD>
'Yes, she must,' replied her daughter. 'But how?'</DD>

<DD>
'A day or two of waiting will do no harm,' said he, almost as if he was
anxious to delay the solution of the problem. 'It will make her anxious,
poor thing, and all sorts of gloomy possibilities will suggest themselves
to her mind - amongst them the truth; it will be a kind of preparation.'</DD>

<DD>
'For what? Something must be done at last,' said Molly.</DD>

<DD>
'Yes; true. Suppose you write, and say he is very ill; write to-morrow.
I daresay they have indulged themselves in daily postage, and then she'll
have had three days' silence. You say how you come to know all how and
about it; I think she ought to know he is very ill - in great danger, if
you like: and you can follow it up next day with the full truth. I would
not worry the squire about it. After the funeral we will have a talk about
the child.'</DD>

<DD>
'She will never part with it,' said Molly.</DD>

<DD>
'Whew! Till I see the woman I can't tell,' said her father; (some women
would. It will be well provided for, according to what you say. And she
is a foreigner, and may very likely wish to go back to her own people and
kindred. There's much to be said on both sides.'</DD>

<DD>
'So you always say, papa. But in this case I think you'll find I'm right.
I judge from her letters; but I think I'm right.'</DD>

<DD>
'So you always say, daughter. Time will show. So the child is a boy? Mrs
Gibson told me particularly to ask. It will go far to reconciling her to
Cynthia's dismissal of Roger. But indeed it is quite as well for both of
them, though of course he will be a long time before he thinks so. They
were not suited to each other. Poor Roger! It was hard work writing to
him yesterday; and who knows what may have become of him! Well, well! one
has to get through the world somehow. I'm glad, however, this little lad
has turned up to be the heir. I should not have liked the property to go
to the Irish Hamleys, who are the next heirs, as Osborne once told me.
Now write that letter, Molly, to the poor little Frenchwoman out yonder.
It will prepare her for it; and we must think a bit how to spare her the
shock, for Osborne's sake.'</DD>

<DD>
The writing this letter was rather difficult work for Molly, and she tore
up two or three copies before she could manage it to her satisfaction;
and at last, in despair of ever doing it better, she sent it off without
re-reading it. The next day was easier; the fact of Osborne's death was
told briefly and tenderly. But when this second letter was sent off, Molly's
heart began to bleed for the poor creature, bereft of her husband, in a
foreign land, and he at a distance from her, dead and buried without her
ever having had the chance of printing his dear features on her memory
by one last long lingering look. With her thoughts full of the unknown
Aim&eacute;e, Molly talked much about her that day to the squire. He would
listen for ever to any conjecture, however wild, about the grandchild,
but perpetually winced away from all discourse about 'the Frenchwoman,'
as he called her; not unkindly, but to his mind she was simply the Frenchwoman
- chattering, dark-eyed, demonstrative, and possibly even rouged. He would
treat her with respect as his son's widow, and would try even not to think
upon the female inveiglement in which he believed. He would make her an
allowance to the extent of his duty; but he hoped and trusted he might
never be called upon to see her. His solicitor, Gibson, anybody and everybody,
should be called upon to form a phalanx of defence against that danger.</DD>

<DD>
And all this time a little, young, grey-eyed woman was making her way;
not towards him, but towards the dead son, whom as yet she believed to
be her living husband. She knew she was acting in defiance of his expressed
wish; but he had never dismayed her with any expression of his own fears
about his health; and she, bright with life, had never contemplated death
coming to fetch away one so beloved. He was ill - very ill, the letter
from the strange girl said that; but Aim&eacute;e had nursed her parents,
and knew what illness was. The French doctor had praised her skill and
neat-handedness as a nurse, and even if she had been the clumsiest of women,
was he not her husband - her all? And was she not his wife, whose place
was by his pillow? So without even as much reasoning as has been here given,
Aim&eacute;e made her preparations, swallowing down the tears that would
overflow her eyes, and drop into the little trunk she was packing so neatly.
And by her side, on the ground, sate the child, now nearly two years old;
and for him Aim&eacute;e had always a smile and a cheerful word. Her servant
loved her and trusted her; and the woman was of an age to have had experience
of humankind. Aim&eacute;e had told her that her husband was ill, and the
servant had known enough of the household history to know that as yet Aim&eacute;e
was not his acknowledged wife. But she sympathized with the prompt decision
of her mistress to go to him directly, wherever he was, Caution comes from
education of one kind or another, and Aim&eacute;e was not dismayed by
warnings; only the woman pleaded hard for the child to be left. 'He was
such company,' she said; 'and he would so tire his mother in her journeying;
and maybe his father would be too ill to see him.' To which Aim&eacute;e
replied, 'Good company for you, but better for me. A woman is never tired
with carrying her own child' (which was not true; but there was sufficient
truth in it to make it be believed by both mistress and servant), 'and
if <I>Monsieur</I> could care for anything, he would rejoice to hear the
babble of his little son.' So Aim&eacute;e caught the evening coach to
London at the nearest cross-road, Martha standing by as chaperon and friend
to see her off, and handing her in the large lusty child, already crowing
with delight at the sight of the horses. There was a '<I>lingerie</I>'
shop, kept by a Frenchwoman, whose acquaintance Aim&eacute;e had made in
the days when she was a London nursemaid, and thither she betook herself,
rather than to an hotel, to spend the few night-hours that intervened before
the Birmingham coach started at early morning. She slept or watched on
a sofa in the parlour, for spare-bed there was none; but Madame Pauline
came in betimes with a good cup of coffee for the mother, and of '<I>soupe
blanche</I>' for the boy; and they went off again into the wide world,
only thinking of, only seeking the 'him,' who was everything human to both.
Aim&eacute;e remembered the sound of the name of the village where Osborne
had often told her that he alighted from the coach to walk home; and though
she could never have spelt the strange uncouth word, yet she spoke it with
pretty slow distinctness to the guard, asking him in her broken English
when they should arrive there? Not till four o'clock. Alas! and what might
happen before then! Once with him she should have no fear; she was sure
that she could bring him round; but what might not happen before he was
in her tender care? She was a very capable person in many ways, though
so childish and innocent in others. She made up her mind to the course
she should pursue when the coach set her down at Feversham. She asked for
a man to carry her trunk, and show her the way to Hamley Hall.</DD>

<DD>
'Hamley Hall!' said the innkeeper. 'Eh! there's a deal of trouble there
just now.'</DD>

<DD>
'I know, I know,' said she, hastening off after the wheelbarrow in which
her trunk was going, and breathlessly struggling to keep up with it, her
heavy child asleep in her arms. Her pulses beat all over her body; she
could hardly see out of her eyes. To her, a foreigner, the drawn blinds
of the house, when she came in sight of it, had no significance; she hurried,
stumbled on.</DD>

<DD>
'Back door or front, missus?' asked the boots from the inn.</DD>

<DD>
'The most nearest,' said she. And the front door was 'the most nearest.'
Molly was sitting with the squire in the darkened drawing-room, reading
out her translations of Aim&eacute;e's letters to her husband. The squire
was never weary of hearing them; the very sound of Molly's voice soothed
and comforted him, it was so sweet and low. And he pulled her up, much
as a child does, if on a second reading of the same letter she substituted
one word for another. The house was very still this afternoon, still as
it had been now for several days; every servant in it, however needless,
moving about on tiptoe, speaking below the breath, and shutting doors as
softly as might be The nearest noise or stir of active life was that of
the rooks in the trees, who were beginning their spring chatter of business.
Suddenly, through this quiet, there came a ring at the front-door bell
that sounded, and went on sounding, through the house, pulled by an ignorant
vigorous hand. Molly stopped reading; she and the squire looked at each
other in surprised dismay. Perhaps a thought of Roger's sudden (and impossible)
return was in the mind of each; but neither spoke. They heard Robinson
hurrying to answer the unwonted summons. They listened; but they heard
no more. There was little more to hear. When the old servant opened the
door, a lady with a child in her arms stood there. She gasped out her ready-prepared
English sentence, -</DD>

<DD>
'Can I see Mr Osborne Hamley? He is ill, I know; but I am his wife.'</DD>

<DD>
Robinson had been aware that there was some mystery, long suspected by
the servants, and come to light at last to the master, - he had guessed
that there was a young woman in the case; but when she stood there before
him, asking for her dead husband as if he were living, any presence of
mind Robinson might have had forsook him; he could not tell her the truth,
- he could only leave the door open, and say to her, 'Wait awhile, I'll
come back,' and betake himself to the drawing-room where Molly was, he
knew. He went up to her in a flutter and a hurry, and whispered something
to her which turned her white with dismay.</DD>

<DD>
'What is it? What is it?' said the squire, trembling with excitement. 'Don't
keep it from me. I can bear it. Roger -- ' They both thought he was going
to faint; he had risen up and come close to Molly; suspense would be worse
than anything.</DD>

<DD>
'Mrs Osborne Hamley is here,' said Molly. 'I wrote to tell her her husband
was very ill, and she has come.'</DD>

<DD>
'She does not know what has happened, seemingly,' said Robinson.</DD>

<DD>
'I can't see her - I can't see her,' said the squire, shrinking away into
a corner. 'You will go, Molly, won't you? You'll go.'</DD>

<DD>
Molly stood for a moment or two, irresolute. She, too, shrank from the
interview. Robinson put in his word, - 'She looks but a weakly thing, and
has carried a big baby, choose how far, I did not stop to ask.'</DD>

<DD>
At this instant the door softly opened, and right into the midst of them
came the little figure in grey, looking ready to fall with the weight of
her child.</DD>

<DD>
'You are Molly,' said she, not seeing the squire at once. 'The lady who
wrote the letter; he spoke of you sometimes. You will let me go to him.'</DD>

<DD>
Molly did not answer, except that at such moments the eyes speak solemnly
and comprehensively. Aim&eacute;e read their meaning. All she said was,
- 'He is not - oh, my husband - my husband!' Her arms relaxed, her figure
swayed, the child screamed and held out his arms for help. That help was
given him by his grandfather, just before Aim&eacute;e fell senseless on
the floor.</DD>

<DD>
'Maman, maman!' cried the little fellow, now striving and fighting to get
back to her, where she lay; he fought so lustily that the squire had to
put him down, and he crawled to the poor inanimate body, behind which sate
Molly, holding the head; whilst Robinson rushed away for water, wine, and
more womankind.</DD>

<DD>
'Poor thing, poor thing!' said the squire, bending over her, and crying
afresh over her suffering. 'She is but young, Molly, and she must ha' loved
him dearly.'</DD>

<DD>
'To be sure!' said Molly, quickly. She was untying the bonnet, and taking
off the worn, but neatly mended gloves; there was the soft luxuriant black
hair, shading the pale, innocent face, - the little notable-looking brown
hands, with the wedding-ring for sole ornament. The child clustered his
fingers round one of hers, and nestled up against her with his plaintive
cry, getting more and more into a burst of wailing: 'Maman, maman!' At
the growing acuteness of his imploring, her hand moved, her lips quivered,
consciousness came partially back. She did not open her eyes, but great
heavy tears stole out from beneath her eyelashes. Molly held her head against
her own breast; and they tried to give her wine, - which she shrank from
- water, which she did not reject; that was all. At last she tried to speak.
'Take me away,' she said, 'into the dark. Leave me alone.'</DD>

<DD>
So Molly and the woman lifted her up and carried her away, and laid her
on the bed, in the best bed-chamber in the house, and darkened the already
shaded light. She was like an unconscious corpse herself, in that she offered
neither assistance nor resistance to all that they were doing. But just
before Molly was leaving the room to take up her watch outside the door,
she felt rather than heard that Aim&eacute;e spoke to her.</DD>

<DD>
'Food - bread and milk for baby.' But when they brought her food herself,
she only shrank away and turned her face to the wall without a word. In
the hurry the child had been left with Robinson and the squire. For some
unknown, but most fortunate reason, he took a dislike to Robinson's red
face and hoarse voice, and showed a most decided preference for his grandfather.
When Molly came down she found the squire feeding the child, with more
of peace upon his face than there had been for all these days. The boy
was every now and then leaving off taking his bread and milk to show his
dislike to Robinson by word and gesture: a proceeding which only amused
the old servant, while it highly delighted the more favoured squire.</DD>

<DD>
'She is lying very still, but she will neither speak nor eat. I don't even
think she is crying,' said Molly, volunteering this account, for the squire
was for the moment too much absorbed in his grandson to ask many questions.</DD>

<DD>
Robinson put in his word, - 'Dick Hayward, he's Boots at the Hamley Arms,
says the coach she come by started at five this morning from London, and
the passengers said she'd been crying a deal on the road, when she thought
folks were not noticing; and she never came in to meals with the rest,
but stopped feeding her child.'</DD>

<DD>
'She'll be tired out; we must let her rest,' said the squire. 'And I do
believe this little chap is going to sleep in my arms. God bless him.'</DD>

<DD>
But Molly stole out, and sent off a lad to Hollingford with a note to her
father. Her heart had warmed towards the poor stranger, and she felt uncertain
as to what ought to be the course pursued in her case.</DD>

<DD>
She went up from time to time to look at the girl, scarce older than herself,
who lay there with her eyes open, but as motionless as death. She softly
covered her over, and let her feel the sympathetic presence from time to
time; and that was all she was allowed to do. The squire was curiously
absorbed in the child; but Molly's supreme tenderness was for the mother.
Not but what she admired the sturdy, gallant, healthy little fellow, whose
every limb, and square inch of clothing, showed the tender and thrifty
care that had been taken of him. By-and-by the squire said in a whisper,
-</DD>

<DD>
'She is not like a Frenchwoman, is she, Molly?'</DD>

<DD>
'I don't know. I don't know what Frenchwomen are like. People say Cynthia
is French.'</DD>

<DD>
'And she did not look like a servant? We won't speak of Cynthia since she's
served my Roger so. Why, I began to think, as soon as I could think after
<I>that</I>, how I would make Roger and her happy, and have them married
at once; and then came that letter! I never wanted her for a daughter-in-law,
not I. But he did, it seems; and he was not one for wanting many things
for himself. But it's all over now; only we won't talk of her; and maybe,
as you say, she was more French than English. The poor thing looks like
a gentlewoman, I think. I hope she's got friends who'll take care of her,
- she can't be above twenty. I thought she must be older than my poor lad!'</DD>

<DD>
'She's a gentle, pretty creature,' said Molly. 'But - but I sometimes think
it has killed her; she lies like one dead.' And Molly could not keep from
crying softly at the thought.</DD>

<DD>
'Nay, nay!' said the squire. 'It's not so easy to break one's heart. Sometimes
I've wished it were. But one has to go on living - all the appointed days,
as it says in the Bible.' But we'll do our best for her. We'll not think
of letting her go away till she's fit to travel.'</DD>

<DD>
Molly wondered in her heart about this going away, on which the squire
seemed fully resolved. She was sure that he intended to keep the child;
perhaps he had a legal right to do so; - but would the mother ever part
from it? Her father, however, would solve the difficulty, - her father,
whom she always looked to as so clear-seeing and experienced. She watched
and waited for his coming. The February evening drew on; the child lay
asleep in the squire's arms till his grandfather grew tired, and laid him
down on the sofa: the large square-cornered yellow sofa upon which Mrs
Hamley used to sit, supported by pillows in a half-reclining position.
Since her time it had been placed against the wall, and had served merely
as a piece of furniture to fill up the room. But once again a human figure
was lying upon it; a little human creature, like a cherub in some old Italian
picture. The squire, remembered his wife as he put the child down. He thought
of her as he said to Molly, -</DD>

<DD>
'How pleased she would have been!' But Molly thought of the young widow
upstairs. Aim&eacute;e was her 'she' at the first moment. Presently, -
but it seemed a long long time first, - she heard the quick prompt sounds,
which told of her father's arrival. In he came - to the room as yet only
lighted by the fitful blaze of the fire.</DD>
