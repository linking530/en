<P>It seemed curious enough, after the storms of the night, to meet in
smooth tranquillity at breakfast. Cynthia was pale; but she talked as quietly
as usual about all manner of indifferent things, while Molly sate silent,
watching and wondering, and becoming convinced that Cynthia must have gone
through a long experience of concealing her real thoughts and secret troubles
before she could have been able to put on such a semblance of composure.
Among the letters that came in that morning was one from the London Kirkpatricks;
but not from Helen, Cynthia's own particular correspondent. Her sister
wrote to apologize for Helen, who was not well, she said: had had the influenza,
which had left her very weak and poorly.

<P>'Let her come down here for change of air,' said Mr Gibson. 'The country
at this time of the year is better than London, excepting when the place
is surrounded by trees. Now our house is well drained, high up, gravel
soil, and I'll undertake to doctor her for nothing.'

<P>'It would be charming,' said Mrs Gibson, rapidly revolving in her mind
the changes necessary in her household economy before receiving a young
lady accustomed to such a household as Mr Kirkpatrick's, and calculating
the consequent inconveniences in her own mind, weighing them against the
probable advantages even while she spoke.

<P>'Should not you like it, Cynthia? and Molly too. You too, dear, would
become acquainted with one of the girls, and I have no doubt you would
be asked back again, which would be so very nice!'

<P>'And I should not let her go,' said Mr Gibson, who had acquired an unfortunate
facility of reading his wife's thoughts.

<P>'Dear Helen!' went on Mrs Gibson, 'I should so like to nurse her, we
would make your consulting-room into her own private sitting-room, my dear.'
- (It is hardly necessary to say that the scales had been weighed down
by the inconveniences of having a person behind the scenes for several
weeks). 'For with an invalid so much depends on tranquillity. In the drawing-room,
for instance, she might constantly be disturbed by callers; and the dining-room
is so - so what shall I call it? so dinnery, - the smell of meals never
seems to leave it; it would have been different if dear papa had allowed
me to throw out that window -- '

<P>'Why can't she have the dressing-room for her bed-room, and the little
room opening out of the drawing-room for her sitting-room?' asked Mr Gibson.

<P>'The library,' for by this name Mrs Gibson chose to dignify what had
formerly been called the book-closet, - 'why, it would hardly hold a sofa,
besides the books and the writing-table, and there are draughts everywhere.
No, my dear, we had better not ask her at all, her own home is comfortable
at any rate!'

<P>'Well, well!' said Mr Gibson, seeing that he was to be worsted, and
not caring enough about the matter to show fight. 'Perhaps you are right.
It's a case of luxury versus fresh air. Some people suffer more from the
want of one than from want of the other. You know I shall be glad to see
her if she likes to come, and take us as we are, but I can't give up the
consulting-room. It's a necessity; our daily bread!'

<P>'I'll write and tell them how kind Mr Gibson is,' said his wife in high
contentment, as her husband left the room. 'They'll be just as much obliged
to him as if she had come!'

<P>Whether it was Helen's illness, or from some other cause, after breakfast
Cynthia became very flat and absent, and this lasted all day long; Molly
understood now why her moods had been so changeable for many months, and
was tender and forbearing with her accordingly. Towards evening when the
two girls were left alone, Cynthia came and stood over Molly, so that her
face could not be seen.

<P>'Molly,' said she, 'will you do it? Will you do what you said last night?
I have been thinking of it all day, and sometimes I believe he would give
you back the letters if you asked him; he might fancy - at any rate it's
worth trying, if you don't very much dislike it.'

<P>Now it so happened that with every thought she had given to it, Molly
disliked the idea of the proposed interview with Mr !Preston more and more;
but it was after all her own offer, and she neither could nor would draw
back from it; it might do good; she did not see how it could possibly do
harm. So she gave her consent, and tried to conceal her distaste, which
grew upon her more and more as Cynthia hastily arranged the details.

<P>'You shall meet him in the avenue leading from the park lodge up to
the Towers. He can come in one way, from the Towers, where he has often
business - he has pass-keys everywhere - you can go in as we have often
done by the lodge - you need not go far.'

<P>It did strike Molly that Cynthia must have had some experience in making
all these arrangements; and she did venture to ask how he was to be informed
of all this? Cynthia only reddened, and replied, 'Oh! never mind! He will
only be too glad to come; you heard him say he wished to discuss the affair
more; it is the first time the appointment has come from my side. If I
can but once be free - oh, Molly, I will love you, and be grateful to you
all my life!'

<P>Molly thought of Roger, and that thought prompted her next speech.

<P>'It must be horrible - I think I'm very brave - but I don't think I
could have - could have accepted even Roger, with a half-cancelled engagement
hanging over me.' She blushed as she spoke.

<P>'You forget how I detest Mr Preston!' said Cynthia. 'It was that, more
than any excess of love for Roger, that made me thankful to be at least
as securely pledged to some one else. He did not want to call it an engagement,
but I did; because it gave me the feeling of assurance that I was free
from Mr Preston. And so I am! all but these letters. Oh! if you can but
make him take back his abominable money, and get me my letters. Then we
would bury it all in oblivion, and he could marry somebody else, and I
would marry Roger, and no one would be the wiser. After all it was only
what people call "youthful folly." And you may tell Mr Preston that as
soon as he makes my letters public, shows them to your father or anything,
I'll go away from Hollingford, and never come back -- '

<P>Loaded with many such messages, which she felt that she should never
deliver, not really knowing what she should say, hating the errand, not
satisfied with Cynthia's manner of speaking about her relations to Roger,
oppressed with shame and complicity in conduct which appeared to her deceitful,
yet willing to bear all and brave all, if she could once set Cynthia in
a straight path - in a clear space, and almost more pitiful to her friend's
great distress and possible disgrace, than able to give her that love which
involves perfect sympathy, Molly set out on her walk towards the appointed
place. It was a cloudy blustering day, and the noise of the blowing wind
among the nearly leafless branches of the great trees filled her ears,
as she passed through the park-gates and entered the avenue. She walked
quickly, instinctively wishing to get her blood up, and have no time for
thought. But there was a bend in the avenue about a quarter of a mile from
the lodge; after that bend it was a straight line up to the great house,
now emptied of its inhabitants. Molly did not like going quite out of sight
of the lodge, and she stood facing it, close by the trunk of one of the
trees. Presently she heard a step coming over the grass. It was Mr Preston.
He saw a woman's figure, half-behind the trunk of a tree, and made no doubt
that it was Cynthia. But when he came nearer, almost close, the figure
turned round, and, instead of the brilliantly coloured face of Cynthia,
he met the pale resolved look of Molly. She did not speak to greet him,
but though he felt sure from the general aspect of pallor and timidity
that she was afraid of him, her steady grey eyes met his with courageous
innocence.

<P>'Is Cynthia unable to come?' asked he, perceiving that she expected
him.

<P>'I did not know you thought that you should meet her,' said Molly, a
little surprised. In her simplicity she had believed that Cynthia had named
that it was she, Molly Gibson, who would meet Mr Preston at a given time
and place; but Cynthia had been too worldly-wise for that, and had decoyed
him thither by a vaguely worded note, which, while avoiding actual falsehood,
had led him to believe that she herself would give him the meeting.

<P>'She said she should be here,' said Mr Preston, extremely annoyed at
being entrapped as he now felt that he had been, into an interview with
Miss Gibson. Molly hesitated a little before she spoke. He was determined
not to break the silence; as she had intruded herself into the affair,
she should find her situation as awkward as possible.

<P>'At any rate she sent me here to meet you,' said Molly. 'She has told
me exactly how matters stand between you and her.'

<P>'Has she?' sneered he. 'She is not always the most open or reliable
person in the world!'

<P>Molly reddened. She perceived the impertinence of the tone; and her
temper was none of the coolest. But she mastered herself and gained courage
by so doing.

<P>'You should not speak so of the person you profess to wish to have for
your wife. But putting all that aside, you have some letters of hers that
she wishes to have back again.'

<P>'I dare say.'

<P>'And that you have no right to keep.'

<P>'No legal, or no moral right? which do you mean?'

<P>'I do not know; simply you have no right at all, as a gentleman, to
keep a girl's letters when she asks for them back again, much less to hold
them over her as a threat.'

<P>'I see you do know all, Miss Gibson,' said he, changing his manner to
one of more respect. 'At least she has told you her story from her point
of view, her side; now you must hear mine. She promised me as solemnly
as ever woman -- '

<P>'She was not a woman, she was only a girl, barely sixteen.'

<P>'Old enough to know what she was doing; but I'll call her a girl if
you like. She promised me solemnly to be my wife, making the one stipulation
of secrecy, and a certain period of waiting; she wrote me letters repeating
this promise, and confidential enough to prove that she considered herself
bound to me by such an implied relation. I don't give in to humbug - I
don't set myself up as a saint - and in most ways I can look after my own
interests pretty keenly; you know enough of her position as a penniless
girl, and at that time, with no influential connections to take the place
of wealth, and help me on in the world, it was as sincere and unworldly
a passion as ever man felt; she must say so herself. I might have married
two or three girls with plenty of money; one of them was handsome enough,
and not at all reluctant.'

<P>Molly interrupted him; she was chafed at the conceit of his manner.
'I beg your pardon, but I do not want to hear accounts of young ladies
whom you might have married; I come here simply on behalf of Cynthia, who
does not like you, and who does not wish to marry you.'

<P>'Well, then I must make her "like" me, as you call it. She did "like"
me once, and made promises which she will find it requires the consent
of two people to break. I don't despair of making her love me as much as
ever she did, according to her letters, at least, when we are married.'

<P>'She will never marry you,' said Molly, firmly.

<P>'Then if she ever honours any one else with her preference, he shall
be allowed the perusal of her letters to me.'

<P>Molly almost could have laughed; she was so secure and certain that
Roger would never read letters offered to him under these circumstances;
but then she thought that he would feel such pain at the whole affair,
and at the contact with Mr Preston, especially if he had not heard of it
from Cynthia first, and if she, Molly, could save him pain she would. Before
she could settle what to say, Mr Preston spoke again.

<P>'You said the other day that Cynthia was engaged. May I ask whom to?'

<P>'No,' said Molly, 'you may not. You heard her say it was not an engagement.
It is not exactly; and if it were a full engagement, do you think, after
what you last said, I should tell you to whom? But you may be sure of this,
he would never read a line of your letters. He is too - No! I won't speak
of him before you. You could never understand him.'

<P>'It seems to me that this mysterious "he" is a very fortunate person
to have such a warm defender in Miss Gibson, to whom he is not at all engaged,'
said Mr Preston, with so disagreeable a look on his face that Molly suddenly
found herself on the point of bursting into tears. But she rallied herself,
and worked on - for Cynthia first, and for Roger as well.

<P>'No honourable man or woman will read your letters, and if any people
do read them, they will be so much ashamed of it that they won't dare to
speak of them. What use can they be of to you?'

<P>'They contain Cynthia's reiterated promises of marriage,' replied he.

<P>'She says she would rather leave Hollingford for ever, and go out to
earn her bread, than marry you.'

<P>His face fell a little. He looked so bitterly mortified that Molly was
almost sorry for him.

<P>'Does she say that to you in cold blood? Do you know you are telling
me very hard truths, Miss Gibson? - if they are truths, that is to say,'
he continued, recovering himself a little. 'Young ladies are very fond
of the words "hate" and "detest." I have known many who have applied them
to men whom they were all the time hoping to marry.'

<P>'I cannot tell about other people,' said Molly, 'I only know that Cynthia
does - ' Here she hesitated for a moment; she fell for his pain, and so
she hesitated; but then she brought it out, - 'does as nearly hate you
as anybody like her ever does hate.'

<P>'Like her?' said he, repeating the words almost unconsciously, seizing
on anything to try and hide his mortification.

<P>'I mean, I should hate worse,' said Molly in a low voice.

<P>But he did not attend much to her answer. He was working the point of
his stick into the turf, and his eyes were bent on it.

<P>'So now would you mind sending her back the letters by me? I do assure
you that you cannot make her marry you.'

<P>'You are very simple, Miss Gibson,' said he, suddenly lifting up his
head. 'I suppose that you don't know that there is any other feeling that
can be gratified, excepting love. Have you never heard of revenge? Cynthia
had cajoled me with promises, and little as you or she may believe me -
well, it's of no use speaking of that. I don't mean to let her go unpunished.
You may tell her that. I shall keep the letters, and make use of them as
I see fit when the occasion arises.'

<P>Molly was miserably angry with herself for her mismanagement of the
affair. She had hoped to succeed: she had only made matters worse. What
new argument could she use? Meanwhile he went on, lashing himself up as
he thought how the two girls must have talked him over, bringing in wounded
vanity to add to the rage of disappointed love.

<P>'Mr Osborne Hamley may hear of their contents, though he may be too
honourable to read them. Nay, even your father may hear whispers; and if
I remember them rightly, Miss Cynthia Kirkpatrick does not always speak
in the most respectful terms of the lady who is now Mrs Gibson. There are
-- '

<P>'Stop,' said Molly. 'I won't hear anything out of these letters, written,
when she was almost without friends, to you whom she looked upon as a friend!
But I have thought of what I will do next. I give you fair warning. If
I had not been foolish I should have told my father, but Cynthia made me
promise that I would not. So I will tell it all, from beginning to end,
to Lady Harriet, and ask her to speak to her father. I feel sure that she
will do it; and I don't think you will dare to refuse Lord Cumnor.'

<P>He felt at once that he should not dare; that, clever land-agent as
he was, and high up in the earl's favour on that account, yet that the
conduct of which he had been guilty about these letters, and the threats
which he had held out about them, were just what no gentleman, no honourable
man, no manly man, could put up with in any one about him. He knew that
much, and he wondered how she, the girl standing before him, had been clever
enough to find it out. He forgot himself for an instant in admiration of
her. There she stood, frightened, yet brave, not letting go her hold on
what she meant to do, even when things seemed most against her; and besides,
there was something that struck him most of all perhaps, and which shows
the kind of man he was - he perceived that Molly was as unconscious that
he was a young man, and she a young woman, as if she had been a pure angel
of heaven. Though he felt that he would have to yield, and give up the
letters, he was not going to do it at once; and while he was thinking what
to say so as still to evade making any concession till he had had time
to think over it, he, with his quick senses all about him, heard the trotting
of a horse cranching quickly along over the gravel of the drive. A moment
afterwards, Molly's perception overtook his. He could see the startled
look overspread her face; and in an instant she would have run away, but
before the first rush was made, Mr Preston laid his hand firmly on her
arm.

<P>'Keep quiet. You must be seen. You, at any rate, have done nothing to
be ashamed of.'

<P>As he spoke Mr Sheepshanks came round the bend of the road and was close
upon them. Mr Preston saw, if Molly did not, the sudden look of intelligence
that dawned upon the shrewd ruddy face of the old gentleman - saw, but
did not much heed. He went forwards and spoke to Mr Sheepshanks, who made
a halt right before them.

<P>'Miss Gibson! your servant! Rather a blustering day for a young lady
to be out, and cold, I should say, for standing still too long; eh, Preston?'
poking his whip at the latter in a knowing manner.

<P>'Yes,' said Mr Preston; 'and I'm afraid I have kept Miss Gibson too
long standing.'

<P>Molly did not know what to say or do; so she only bowed a silent farewell,
and turned away to go home, feeling very heavy at heart at the non-success
of her undertaking. For she did not know how she had conquered, in fact,
although Mr Preston might not as yet acknowledge it even to himself. Before
she was out of hearing, she heard Mr Sheepshanks say, -

<P>'Sorry to have disturbed your t&ecirc;te-?t&ecirc;te, Preston,' but
though she heard the words, their implied sense did not sink into her mind;
she was only feeling how she had gone out glorious and confident, and was
coming back to Cynthia defeated. Pr

<P>Cynthia was on the watch for her return, and, rushing downstairs, dragged
Molly into the dining-room.

<P>'Well, Molly? Oh! I see you have not got them. After all, I never expected
it.' She sate down, as if she could get over her disappointment better
in that position, and Molly stood like a guilty person before her.

<P>'I am so sorry; I did all I could; we were interrupted at last - Mr
Sheepshanks rode up.'

<P>'Provoking old man! Do you think you should have persuaded him to give
up the letters if you had had more time?'

<P>'I don't know. I wish Mr Sheepshanks had not come just then. I did not
like his finding me standing talking to Mr Preston.'

<P>'Oh! I daresay he would never think anything about it. What did he -
Mr Preston - say?'

<P>'He seemed to think you were fully engaged to him, and that these letters
were the only proof he had. I think he loves you in his way.'

<P>'His way, indeed!' said Cynthia, scornfully.

<P>'The more I think of it, the more I see it would be better for papa
to speak to him. I did say I would tell it all to Lady Harriet, and get
Lord Cumnor to make him give up the letters. But it would be very awkward.'

<P>'Very!' said Cynthia, gloomily. 'But he would see it was only a threat.'

<P>'But I will do it in a moment, if you like. I meant what I said; only
I feel that papa would manage it best of all, and more privately.'

<P>'I'll tell you what, Molly; you're bound by a promise, you know, and
cannot tell Mr Gibson without breaking your solemn word; but it's just
this. I'll leave Hollingford and never come back again, if ever your father
hears of this affair; there!' Cynthia stood up now, and began to fold up
Molly's shawl, in her nervous excitement.

<P>'Oh, Cynthia - Roger!' was all that Molly said.

<P>'Yes, I know! you need not remind me of him. But I'm not going to live
in the house with any one who may be always casting up in his mind the
things he had heard against me - things - faults, perhaps - which sound
so much worse than they really are. I was so happy when I first came here:
you all liked me, and admired me, and thought well of me, and now -- Why,
Molly, I can see the difference in you already. You carry your thoughts
in your face - I have read them there these two days - you've been thinking,
"How Cynthia must have deceived me; keeping up a correspondence all this
time - having half-engagements to two men." You've been more full of that
than of pity for me as a girl who has always been obliged to manage for
herself, without any friend to help her and protect her.'

<P>Molly was silent. There was a great deal of truth in what Cynthia was
saying; and yet a great deal of falsehood. For, through all this long forty-eight
hours, Molly had loved Cynthia dearly; and had been more weighed down by
the position the latter was in than Cynthia herself. She also knew - but
this was a second thought following on the other - that she had suffered
much pain in trying to do her best in this interview with Mr Preston. She
had been tried beyond her strength; and the great tears welled up into
her eyes, and fell slowly down her cheeks.

<P>'Oh! what a brute I am,' said Cynthia, kissing them away. 'I see - I
know it is the truth, and I deserve it - but I need not reproach you.'

<P>'You did not reproach me!' said Molly, trying to smile. 'I have thought
some of what you said - but I do love you dearly - dearly, Cynthia - I
should have done just the same as you did.'

<P>'No, you would not. Your grain is different, somehow.'
