It appeared as if Mrs Gibson's predictions were likely to be verified;
for Osborne Hamley found his way to her drawing-room pretty frequently.
To be sure, sometimes prophets can help on the fulfilment of their own
prophecies; and Mrs Gibson was not passive.</DD>

<DD>
Molly was altogether puzzled by his manners and ways. He spoke of occasional
absences from the Hall, without exactly saying where he had been. But that
was not her idea of the conduct of a married man, who, she imagined, ought
to have a house and servants, and pay rent and taxes, and live with his
wife. Who this mysterious wife might be, faded into insignificance before
the wonder of where she was. London, Cambridge, Dover, nay even France,
were mentioned by him as places to which he had been on these different
little journeys. These facts came out quite casually, almost as if he was
unaware of what he was betraying; sometimes he dropped out such sentences
as these: - 'Ah, that would be the day I was crossing! It was stormy, indeed!
Instead of our being only two hours, we were nearly five.' Or, 'I met Lord
Hollingford at Dover last week, and he said,' &amp;c. 'The cold now is
nothing to what it was in London on Thursday - the thermometer was down
at 15*.' Perhaps, in the rapid flow of conversation, these small revelations
were noticed by no one but Molly; whose interest and curiosity were always
hovering over the secret she had become possessed of, in spite of all her
self-reproach for allowing her thoughts to dwell on what was still to be
kept as a mystery.</DD>

<DD>
It was also evident to her that Osborne was not too happy at home. He had
lost the slight touch of cynicism which he had affected when he was expected
to do wonders at college; and that was one good result of his failure.
If he did not give himself the trouble of appreciating other people, and
their performances, at any rate his conversation was not so amply sprinkled
with critical pepper. He was more absent, not so agreeable, Mrs Gibson
thought, but did not say. He looked ill in health; but that might be the
consequence of the real depression of spirits which Molly occasionally
saw peeping out through all his pleasant surface-talk. Now and then, he
referred to 'the happy days that are gone,' or, 'to the time when my mother
was alive,' when talking directly to her; and then his voice sank, and
a gloom came over his countenance, and Molly longed to express her own
deep sympathy. He did not often mention his father; and Molly thought she
could read in his manner, when he did, that something of the painful restraint
she had noticed when she was last at the Hall still existed between them.
Nearly all that she knew of the family interior she had heard from Mrs
Hamley, and she was uncertain as to how far her father was acquainted with
them; so she did not like to question him too closely; nor was he a man
to be so questioned as to the domestic affairs of his patients. Sometimes
she wondered if it was a dream - that short half hour in the library at
Hamley Hall - when she had learnt a fact which seemed so all-important
to Osborne, yet which made so little difference in his way of life - either
in speech or action. During the twelve or fourteen hours or so that she
had remained at the Hall afterwards, no further allusion had been made
to his marriage, either by himself or by Roger. It was, indeed, very like
a dream. Probably Molly would have been rendered much more uncomfortable
in the possession of her secret if Osborne had struck her as particularly
attentive in his devotion to Cynthia. She evidently amused and attracted
him, but not in any lively or passionate kind of manner. He admired her
beauty, and seemed to feel her charm; but he would leave her side, and
come to sit near Molly, if anything reminded him of his mother, about which
he could talk to her, and to her alone. Yet he came so often to the Gibsons',
that Mrs Gibson might be excused for the fancy she had taken into her head,
that it was for Cynthia's sake. He liked the lounge, the friendliness,
the company of two intelligent girls of beauty and manners above the average;
one of whom stood in a peculiar relation to him, as having been especially
beloved by the mother whose memory he cherished so fondly. Knowing himself
to be out of the category of bachelors, he was, perhaps, too indifferent
as to other people's ignorance, and its possible consequences.</DD>

<DD>
Somehow, Molly did not like to be the first to introduce Roger's name into
the conversation, so she lost many an opportunity of hearing intelligence
about him. Osborne was often so languid or so absent that he only followed
the lead of talk; and as an awkward fellow, who had paid her no particular
attention, and as a second son, Roger was not pre-eminent in Mrs Gibson's
thoughts; Cynthia had never seen him, and the freak did not take her often
to speak about him. He had not come home since he had obtained his high
place in the mathematical lists: that Molly knew; and she knew, too, that
he was working hard for something - she supposed a fellowship - and that
was all. Osborne's tone in speaking of him was always the same: every word,
every inflexion of the voice breathed out affection and respect - nay,
even admiration! And this from the <I>nil admirari</I> brother, who seldom
carried his exertions so far.</DD>

<DD>
'Ah, Roger!' he said one day. Molly caught the name in an instant, though
she had not heard what had gone before. 'He is a fellow in a thousand -
in a thousand, indeed! I don't believe there is his match anywhere for
goodness and real solid power combined.'</DD>

<DD>
'Molly,' said Cynthia, after Mr Osborne Hamley had gone, 'what sort of
a man is this Roger Hamley? One can't tell how much to believe of his brother's
praises; for it is the one subject on which Osborne Hamley becomes enthusiastic.
I've noticed it once or twice before.'</DD>

<DD>
While Molly hesitated on which point of the large round to begin her description,
Mrs Gibson struck in, -</DD>

<DD>
'It just shows what a sweet disposition Osborne Hamley is of - that he
should praise his brother as he does. I daresay he is senior wrangler,
and much good may it do him! I don't deny that; but as for conversation,
he's as heavy as heavy can be. A great awkward fellow to boot, who looks
as if he did not know two and two made four, for all he is such a mathematical
genius. You would hardly believe he was Osborne Hamley's brother to see
him! I should not think he had a profile at all.'</DD>

<DD>
'What do you think of him, Molly?' said the persevering Cynthia.</DD>

<DD>
'I like him,' said Molly. 'He has been very kind to me. I know he isn't
handsome like Osborne.'</DD>

<DD>
It was rather difficult to say all this quietly, but Molly managed to do
it, quite aware that Cynthia would not rest till she had extracted some
kind of an opinion out of her.</DD>

<DD>
'I suppose he will come home at Easter,' said Cynthia, 'and then I shall
see him for myself.'</DD>

<DD>
'It's a great pity that their being in mourning will prevent their going
to the Easter charity ball,' said Mrs Gibson, plaintively. 'I shan't like
to take you two girls, if you are not to have any partners. It will put
me in such an awkward position. I wish we could join on to the Towers party.
That would secure you partners, for they always bring a number of dancing
men, who might dance with you after they had done their duty by the ladies
of the house. But really everything is so changed since dear Lady Cumnor
has been an invalid that perhaps they won't go at all.'</DD>

<DD>
This Easter ball was a great subject of conversation with Mrs Gibson. She
sometimes spoke of it as her first appearance in society as a bride, though
she had been visiting once or twice a week all winter long. Then she shifted
her ground, and said she felt so much interest in it, because she would
then have the responsibility of introducing both her own and Mr Gibson's
daughter to public notice, though the fact was that pretty nearly every
one who was going to this ball had seen the two young ladies - though not
their ball dresses - before. But, aping the manners of the aristocracy
as far as she knew them, she intended to 'bring out' Molly and Cynthia
on this occasion, which she regarded in something of the light of a presentation
at Court. 'They are not out yet,' was her favourite excuse when either
of them was invited to any house to which she did not wish them to go,
or invited without her. She even made a difficulty about their 'not being
out' when Miss Browning - that old friend of the Gibson family - came in
one morning to ask the two girls to come to a very friendly tea and a round
game afterwards; this mild piece of gaiety being designed as an attention
to three of Mrs Goodenough's grandchildren - two young ladies and their
school-boy brother - who were staying on a visit to their grandmamma.</DD>

<DD>
'You are very kind, Miss Browning, but you see I hardly like to let them
go - they are not out, you know, till after the Easter ball.'</DD>

<DD>
'Till when we are invisible,' said Cynthia, always ready with her mockery
to exaggerate any pretension of her mother's. 'We are so high in rank that
our sovereign must give us her sanction before we can play a round game
at your house.'</DD>

<DD>
Cynthia enjoyed the idea of her own full-grown size and stately gait, as
contrasted with that of a meek, half-fledged girl in the nursery; but Miss
Browning was half puzzled and half affronted.</DD>

<DD>
'I don't understand it at all. In my days girls went wherever it pleased
people to ask them, without this farce of bursting out in all their new
fine clothes at some public place. I don't mean but what the gentry took
their daughters<!--wive--> to York, or Matlock, or Bath to give them a
taste of gay society when they were growing up; and the quality went up
to London, and their young ladies were presented to Queen Charlotte, and
went to a birthday ball, perhaps. But for us little Hollingford people,
why we knew every child amongst us from the day of its birth; and many
a girl of twelve or fourteen have I seen go out to a card-party, and sit
quiet at her work, and know how to behave as well as any lady there. There
was no talk of "coming out" in those days for any one under the daughter
of a squire.'</DD>

<DD>
'After Easter, Molly and I shall know how to behave at a card-party, but
not before,' said Cynthia, demurely.</DD>

<DD>
'You're always fond of your quips and your cranks,' my dear,' said Miss
Browning, 'and I wouldn't quite answer for your behaviour: you sometimes
let your spirits carry you away. But I'm quite sure Molly will be a little
lady as she always is, and always was, and I have known her from a babe.'</DD>

<DD>
Mrs Gibson took up arms on behalf of her own daughter, or rather, she took
up arms against Molly's praises.</DD>

<DD>
'I don't think you would have called Molly a lady the other day, Miss Browning,
if you had found her where I did: sitting up in a cherry-tree, six feet
from the ground at least, I do assure you.'</DD>

<DD>
'Oh! but that wasn't pretty,' said Miss Browning, shaking her head at Molly.
'I thought you'd left off those tomboy ways.'</DD>

<DD>
'She wants the refinement which good society gives in several ways', said
Mrs Gibson, returning to the attack on poor Molly. 'She's very apt to come
upstairs two steps at a time.'</DD>

<DD>
'Only two, Molly!' said Cynthia. 'Why, to-day I found I could manage four
of these broad shallow steps.'</DD>

<DD>
'My dear child, what are you saying?'</DD>

<DD>
'Only confessing that I, like Molly, want the refinements which good society
gives; therefore, please do let us go to Miss Brownings' this evening.
I will pledge myself for Molly that she shan't sit in a cherry-tree; and
Molly shall see that I don't go upstairs in an unladylike way. I will go
upstairs as meekly as if I were a come-out young lady, and had been to
the Easter ball.'</DD>

<DD>
So it was agreed that they should go. If Mr Osborne Hamley had been named
as one of the probable visitors, there would have been none of this difficulty
about the affair.</DD>

<DD>
But though he was not there his brother Roger was. Molly saw him in a minute
when she entered the little drawing-room; but Cynthia did not.</DD>

<DD>
'And see, my dears,' said Miss Phoebe Browning, turning them round to the
side where Roger stood waiting for his turn of speaking to Molly. 'We've
got a gentleman for you after all! Wasn't it fortunate? - just as sister
said that you might find it dull - you, Cynthia, she meant, because you
know you come from France; and then, just as if he had been sent from heaven,
Mr Roger came in to call; and I won't say we laid violent hands on him,
because he was too good for that; but really we should have been near it,
if he had not stayed of his own accord.'</DD>

<DD>
The moment Roger had done his cordial greeting to Molly, he asked her to
introduce him to Cynthia.</DD>

<DD>
'I want to know her - your new sister,' he added, with the kind smile Molly
remembered so well since the very first day she had seen it directed towards
her, as she sate crying under the weeping ash. Cynthia was standing a little
behind Molly when Roger asked for this introduction. She was generally
dressed with careless grace. Molly, who was delicate neatness itself, used
sometimes to wonder how Cynthia's tumbled gowns, tossed away so untidily,
had the art of looking so well and falling in such graceful folds. For
instance, the pale lilac muslin gown she wore this evening had been worn
many times before, and had looked unfit to wear again until Cynthia put
it on. Then the limpness became softness, and the very creases took the
lines of beauty. Molly, in a daintily clean pink muslin, did not look half
so elegantly dressed as Cynthia. The grave eyes that the latter raised
when she had to be presented to Roger had a sort of child-like innocence
and wonder about them, which did not quite belong to Cynthia's character.
She put on her armour of magic that evening - involuntarily as she always
did; but, on the other side, she could not help trying her power on strangers.
Molly had always felt that she should have a right to a good long talk
with Roger when she next saw him; and that he would tell her, or she should
gather from him, all the details she so longed to hear about the squire
- about the Hall - about Osborne - about himself. He was just as cordial
and friendly as ever with her. If Cynthia had not been there all would
have gone on as she had anticipated; but of all the victims to Cynthia's
charms he fell most prone and abject. Molly saw it all, as she was sitting
next to Miss Phoebe at the tea-table, acting right-hand, and passing cake,
cream, sugar, with such busy assiduity that every one besides herself thought
that her mind, as well as her hands, was fully occupied. She tried to talk
to the two shy girls, as in virtue of her two years' seniority she thought
herself bound to do; and the consequence was, she went upstairs with the
twain clinging to her arms, and willing to swear an eternal friendship.
Nothing would satisfy them but that she must sit between them at <I>vingt-un</I>;
and they were so desirous of her advice in the important point of fixing
the price of the counters that she could not even have joined in in the
animated t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te going on between Roger and Cynthia.
Or rather, it would be more correct to say that Roger was talking in a
most animated manner to Cynthia, whose sweet eyes were fixed upon his face
with a look of great interest in all he was saying, while it was only now
and then she made her low replies. Molly caught a few words occasionally
in intervals of business.</DD>

<DD>
'At my uncle's, we always gave a silver threepence for three dozen. You
know what a silver threepence is, don't you, dear Miss Gibson?'</DD>

<DD>
'The three classes are published in the Senate House at nine o'clock on
the Friday morning, and you can't imagine - '</DD>

<DD>
'I think it will be thought rather shabby to play at anything less than
sixpence. That gentleman' (this in a whisper) 'is at Cambridge, and you
know they always play very high there, and sometimes ruin themselves, don't
they, dear Miss Gibson?'</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, on this occasion the Master of Arts who precedes the candidates for
honours when they go into the Senate House is called the Father of the
College to which he belongs. I think I mentioned that before, didn't I?'</DD>

<DD>
So Cynthia was hearing all about Cambridge, and the very examination about
which Molly had felt such keen interest, without having ever been able
to have her questions answered by a competent person; and Roger, to whom
she had always looked as the final and most satisfactory answerer, was
telling all she wanted to know, and she could not listen. It took all her
patience to make up little packets of counters, and settle, as the arbiter
of the game, whether it would be better for the round or the oblong counters
to be reckoned as six. And when all was done, and every one sate in their
places round the table, Roger and Cynthia had to be called twice before
they came. They stood up, it is true, at the first sound of their names;
but they did not move: Roger went on talking, Cynthia listening, till the
second call - when they hurried to the table and tried to appear all on
a sudden quite interested in the great questions of the game, namely, the
price of three dozen counters, and whether, all things considered, it would
be better to call the round counters or the oblong half-a-dozen each. Miss
Browning, drumming the pack of cards on the table, and quite ready to begin
dealing, decided the matter by saying, 'Rounds are sixes, and three dozen
counters cost sixpence. Pay up, if you please, and let us begin at once.'
Cynthia sate between Roger and William Osborne, the young schoolboy, who
bitterly resented on this occasion his sisters' habit of calling him 'Willie,'
as he thought that it was this boyish sobriquet which prevented Cynthia
from attending as much to him as to Mr Roger Hamley; he also was charmed
by the charmer, who found leisure to give him one or two of her sweet smiles.
On his return home to his grandmamma's he gave out one or two very decided
and rather original opinions, quite opposed - as was natural - to his sisters'.
One was, -</DD>

<DD>
'That, after all, a senior wrangler was no great shakes. Any man might
be one if he liked, but there were a lot of fellows that he knew who would
be very sorry to go in for anything so slow.'</DD>

<DD>
Molly thought the game would never end. She had no particular turn for
gambling in her; and whatever her card might be, she regularly put on two
counters, indifferent as to whether she won or lost. Cynthia, on the contrary,
staked high, and was at one time very rich, but ended by being in debt
to Molly something like six shillings. She had forgotten her purse, she
said, and was obliged to borrow from the more provident Molly, who was
aware that the round game of which Miss Browning had spoken to her was
likely to require money. If it was not a very merry affair for all the
individuals concerned, it was a very noisy one on the whole. Molly thought
it was going to last till midnight; but punctually as the clock struck
nine, the little maid-servant staggered in under the weight of a tray loaded
with sandwiches, cakes, and jelly. This brought on a general move; and
Roger, who appeared to have been on the watch for something of the kind,
came and took a chair by Molly.</DD>

<DD>
'I am so glad to see you again - it seems such a long time since Christmas,'
said he, dropping his voice, and not alluding more exactly to the day when
she had left the Hall.</DD>

<DD>
'It is a long time,' she replied; 'we are close to Easter now. I have so
wanted to tell you how glad I was to hear about your honours at Cambridge.
I once thought of sending you a message through your brother, but then
I thought it might be making too much fuss, because I know nothing of mathematics,
or of the value of a senior-wranglership; and you were sure to have so
many congratulations from people who did know.'</DD>

<DD>
'I missed yours though, Molly,' said he, kindly. 'But I felt sure you were
glad for me.'</DD>

<DD>
'Glad and proud too,' said she. 'I should so like to hear something more
about it. I heard you telling Cynthia -- '</DD>

<DD>
'Yes. What a charming person she is! I should think you must be happier
than we expected long ago.'</DD>

<DD>
'But tell me something about the senior-wranglership, please,' said Molly.</DD>

<DD>
'It's a long story, and I ought to be helping the Miss Brownings to hand
sandwiches - besides, you wouldn't find it very interesting, it's so full
of technical details.'</DD>

<DD>
'Cynthia looked very much interested,' said Molly.</DD>

<DD>
'Well! then I refer you to her, for I must go now. I can't for shame go
on sitting here, and letting those good ladies have all the trouble. But
I shall come and call on Mrs Gibson soon. Are you walking home to-night?'</DD>

<DD>
'Yes, I think so,' replied Molly, eagerly foreseeing what was to come.</DD>

<DD>
'Then I shall walk home with you. I left my horse at the "George," and
that's half-way. I suppose old Betty will allow me to accompany you and
your sister? You used to describe her as something of a dragon.'</DD>

<DD>
'Betty has left us,' said Molly, sadly. 'She's gone to live at a place
at Ashcombe.'</DD>

<DD>
He made a face of dismay, and then went off to his duties. The short conversation
had been very pleasant, and his manner had had just the brotherly kindness
of old times; but it was not quite the manner he had to Cynthia; and Molly
half thought she would have preferred the latter. He was now hovering about
Cynthia, who had declined the offer of refreshments from Willie Osborne.
Roger was tempting her, and with playful entreaties urging her to take
something from him. Every word they said could be heard by the whole room;
yet every word was said, on Roger's part at least, as if he could not have
spoken it in that peculiar manner to any one else. At length, and rather
more because she was weary of being entreated, than because it was his
wish, Cynthia took a macaroon, and Roger seemed as happy as though she
had crowned him with flowers. The whole affair was as trifling and commonplace
as could be in itself. hardly worth noticing: and yet Molly did notice
it, and felt uneasy; she could not tell why. As it turned out, it was a
rainy night, and Mrs Gibson sent a fly for the two girls instead of old
Betty's substitute. Both Cynthia and Molly thought of the possibility of
their taking the two Osborne girls back to their grandmother's, and so
saving them a wet walk; but Cynthia got the start in speaking about it;
and the thanks and the implied praise for thoughtfulness were hers.</DD>

<DD>
When they got home Mr and Mrs Gibson were sitting in the drawing-room,
quite ready to be amused by any details of the evening.</DD>

<DD>
Cynthia began, -</DD>

<DD>
'Oh! it wasn't very entertaining. One didn't expect that,' and she yawned
wearily.</DD>

<DD>
'Who were there?' asked Mr Gibson. 'Quite a young party - wasn't it?'</DD>

<DD>
'They'd only asked Lizzie and Fanny Osborne, and their brother; but Mr
Roger Hamley had ridden over and called on the Miss Brownings, and they
had kept him to tea. No one else.'</DD>

<DD>
'Roger Hamley there!' said Mr Gibson. 'He's come home then. I must make
time to ride over and see him.'</DD>

<DD>
'You'd much better ask him here,' said Mrs Gibson. 'Suppose you invite
him and his brother to dine here on Friday, my dear? It would be a very
pretty attention, I think.'</DD>

<DD>
'My dear! these young Cambridge men have a very good taste in wine, and
don't spare it. My cellar won't stand many of their attacks.'</DD>

<DD>
'I didn't think you were so inhospitable, Mr Gibson.'</DD>

<DD>
'I'm not inhospitable, I'm sure. If you'll put "bitter beer" in the corner
of your notes of invitation, just as the smart people put "quadrilles"
as a sign of entertainment offered, we'll have Osborne and Roger to dinner
any day you like. And what did you think of my favourite, Cynthia? You
hadn't seen him before, I think?'</DD>

<DD>
'Oh! he's nothing like so handsome as his brother; nor so polished; nor
so easy to talk to. He entertained me for more than an hour with a long
account of some examination or other; but there's something one likes about
him.'</DD>

<DD>
'Well - and Molly - ' said Mrs Gibson, who piqued herself on being an impartial
stepmother; and who always tried hard to make Molly talk as much as Cynthia
- 'what sort of an evening have you had?'</DD>

<DD>
'Very pleasant, thank you.' Her heart a little belied her as she said this.
She had not cared for the round game; and she would have cared for Roger's
conversation. She had had what she was indifferent to, and not had what
she would have liked.</DD>

<DD>
'We've had our unexpected visitor, too,' said Mr Gibson. 'Just after dinner
who should come in but Mr Preston. I fancy he's having more of the management
of the Hollingford property than formerly. Sheepshanks is getting an old
man. And if so, I suspect we shall see a good deal of Preston. He's "no
blate," as they used to say in Scotland, and made himself quite at home
to-night. If I'd asked him to stay, or, indeed, if I'd done anything but
yawn, he'd have been here now. But I defy any man to stay when I have a
fit of yawning.'</DD>

<DD>
'Do you like Mr Preston, papa?' asked Molly.</DD>

<DD>
'About as much as I do half the men I meet. He talks well, and has seen
a good deal. I know very little of him, though, except that he's my lord's
steward, which is a guarantee for a good deal.'</DD>

<DD>
'Lady Harriet spoke pretty strongly against him that day I was with her
at the Manor-house.'</DD>

<DD>
'Lady Harriet's always full of fancies: she likes persons to-day, and dislikes
them to-morrow,' said Mrs Gibson, who was touched on her sore point whenever
Molly quoted Lady Harriet, or said anything to imply ever so transitory
an intimacy with her.</DD>

<DD>
'You must know a good deal about Mr Preston, my dear? I suppose you saw
a good deal of him at Ashcombe?'</DD>

<DD>
Mrs Gibson coloured, and looked at Cynthia before she replied. Cynthia's
face was set into a determination not to speak, however much she might
be referred to.</DD>

<DD>
'Yes; we saw a good deal of him - at one time, I mean. He's changeable,
I think. But he always sent us game, and sometimes fruit. There were some
stories against him, but I never believed them.'</DD>

<DD>
'What kind of stories?' said Mr Gibson, quickly.</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, vague stories, you know: scandal, I daresay. No one ever believed
them. He could be so agreeable if he chose; and my lord, who is so very
particular, would never have kept him as agent if they were true; not that
I ever knew what they were, for I consider all scandal as abominable gossip.'</DD>

<DD>
'I'm very glad I yawned in his face,' said Mr Gibson. 'I hope he'll take
the hint.'</DD>

<DD>
'If it was one of your giant-gapes, papa, I should call it more than a
hint,' said Molly. 'And if you want a yawning chorus the next time he comes,
I'll join in; won't you, Cynthia?'</DD>

<DD>
'I don't know,' replied the latter, shortly, as she lighted her bed-candle.
The two girls had usually some nightly conversation in one or other of
their bed-rooms; but to-night Cynthia said something or other about being
terribly tired, and hastily shut her door.</DD>

<DD>
The very next day, Roger came to pay his promised call. Molly was out in
the garden with Williams, planning the arrangement of some new flower-beds,
and deep in her employment of placing pegs upon the lawn to mark out the
different situations, when, standing up to mark the effect, her eye was
caught by the figure of a gentleman, sitting with his back to the light,
leaning forwards, and talking, or listening, eagerly. Molly knew the shape
of the head perfectly, and hastily began to put off her brown-holland gardening
apron, emptying the pockets as she spoke to Williams.</DD>

<DD>
'You can finish it now, I think,' said she. 'You know about the bright-coloured
flowers being against the privet-hedge, and where the new rose-bed it to
be?'</DD>

<DD>
'I can't justly say as I do,' said he. 'Mebbe, you'll just go o'er it all
once again, Miss Molly. I'm not so young as I oncst was, and my head is
not so clear now-a-days, and I'd be loth to make mistakes when you're so
set upon your plans.'</DD>

<DD>
Molly gave up her impulse in a moment. She saw that the old gardener was
really perplexed, yet that he was as anxious as he could be to do his best.
So she went over the ground again, pegging and explaining till the wrinkled
brow was smooth again, and he kept saying, 'I see, miss. All right, Miss
Molly, I'se gotten it in my head as clear as patch-work now.'</DD>

<DD>
So she could leave him, and go in. But just as she was close to the garden
door, Roger came out. It really was for once a case of virtue its own reward,
for it was far pleasanter to her to have him in a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te,
however short, than in the restraint of Mrs Gibson's and Cynthia's presence.</DD>

<DD>
'I only just found out where you were, Molly. Mrs Gibson said you had gone
out, but she didn't know where; and it was the greatest chance that I turned
round and saw you.'</DD>

<DD>
'I saw you some time ago, but I couldn't leave Williams. I think he was
unusually slow to-day; and he seemed as if he couldn't understand my plan
for the new flower-beds.'</DD>

<DD>
'Is that the paper you've got in your hand? Let me look at it, will you?
Ah, I see! you've borrowed some of your ideas from our garden at home,
haven't you? This bed of scarlet geraniums, with the border of young oaks,
pegged down! That was a fancy of my dear mother's.'</DD>

<DD>
They were both silent for a minute or two. Then Molly said, -</DD>

<DD>
'How is the squire? I've never seen him since.'</DD>

<DD>
'No, he told me how much he wanted to see you, but he couldn't make up
his mind to come and call. I suppose it would never do now for you to come
and stay at the Hall, would it? It would give my father so much pleasure:
he looks upon you as a daughter, and I'm sure both Osborne and I shall
always consider you are like a sister to us, after all my mother's love
for you, and your tender care of her at last. But I suppose it wouldn't
do.'</DD>

<DD>
'No! certainly not,' said Molly, hastily.</DD>

<DD>
'I fancy if you could come it would put us a little to rights. You know,
as I think I once told you, Osborne has behaved differently to what I should
have done, though not wrongly, - only what I call an error of judgment.
But my father, I'm sure, has taken up some notion of - never mind; only
the end of it is that he holds Osborne still in tacit disgrace, and is
miserable himself all the time. Osborne, too, is sore and unhappy, and
estranged from my father. It is just what my mother would have put right
very soon, and perhaps you could have done it - unconsciously, I mean -
for this wretched mystery that Osborne preserves about his affairs is at
the root of it all. But there's no use talking about it; I don't know why
I began.' Then, with a wrench, changing the subject, while Molly still
thought of what he had been telling her, he broke out, - 'I can't tell
you how much I like Miss Kirkpatrick, Molly. It must be a great pleasure
to you having such a companion!'</DD>

<DD>
'Yes,' said Molly, half smiling. 'I'm very fond of her; and I think I like
her better every day I know her. But how quickly you have found out her
virtues!'</DD>

<DD>
'I didn't say "virtues," did I?' asked he, reddening, but putting the question
in all good faith. 'Yet I don't think one could be deceived in that face.
And Mrs Gibson appears to be a very friendly person, - she has asked Osborne
and me to dine here on Friday.'</DD>

<DD>
'Bitter beer' came into Molly's mind; but what she said was, 'And are you
coming?'</DD>

<DD>
'Certainly, I am, unless my father wants me; and I've given Mrs Gibson
a conditional promise for Osborne too. So I shall see you all very soon
again. But I must go now. I have to keep an appointment seven miles from
here in half an hour's time. Good luck to your flower-garden, Molly.'</DD>
