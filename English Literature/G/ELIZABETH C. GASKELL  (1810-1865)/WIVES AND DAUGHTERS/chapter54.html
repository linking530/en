Mr Gibson came in rubbing his hands after his frosty ride. Molly judged
from the look in his eye that he had been fully informed of the present
state of things at the Hall by some one. But he simply went up to and greeted
the squire, and waited to hear what was said to him. The squire was fumbling
at the taper on the writing-table, and before he answered much he lighted
it, and signing to his friend to follow him, he went softly to the sofa
and showed him the sleeping child, taking the utmost care not to arouse
it by flare or sound.</DD>

<DD>
'Well! this is a fine young gentleman,' said Mr Gibson, returning to the
fire rather sooner than the squire expected. 'And you've got the mother
here, I understand. Mrs Osborne Hamley, as we must call her, poor thing!
It's a sad coming home to her. for I hear she knew nothing of his death.'
He spoke without exactly addressing any one, so that either Molly or the
squire might answer as they liked. The squire said, -</DD>

<DD>
'Yes! She has felt it a terrible shock. She's upstairs in the best bedroom.
I should like you to see her, Gibson, if she'll let you. We must do our
duty by her, for my poor lad's sake. I wish he could have seen his boy
lying there; I do. I daresay it preyed on him to have to keep it all to
himself. He might ha' known me, though. He might ha' known my bark was
waur than my bite. It's all over now, though; and God forgive me if I was
too sharp. I'm punished now.'</DD>

<DD>
Molly grew impatient on the mother's behalf.</DD>

<DD>
'Papa, I feel as if she was very ill; perhaps worse than we think. Will
you go and see her at once?'</DD>

<DD>
Mr Gibson followed her upstairs, and the squire came too, thinking that
he would do his duty now, and even feeling some self-satisfaction at conquering
his desire to stay with the child. They went into the room where she had
been taken. She lay quite still in the same position as at first. Her eyes
were open and tearless, fixed on the wall. Mr Gibson spoke to her, but
she did not answer; he lifted her hand to feel her pulse; she never noticed.</DD>

<DD>
'Bring me some wine at once, and order some beef-tea,' he said to Molly.</DD>

<DD>
But when he tried to put the wine into her mouth as she lay there on her
side, she made no effort to receive or swallow it, and it ran out upon
the pillow. Mr Gibson left the room abruptly; Molly chafed the little inanimate
hand; the squire stood by in dumb dismay, touched in spite of himself by
the death-in-life of one so young, and who must have been so much beloved.</DD>

<DD>
Mr Gibson came back two steps at a time; he was carrying the half-awakened
child in his arms. He did not scruple to rouse him into yet further wakefulness
- did not grieve to hear him begin to wail and cry. His eyes were on the
figure upon the bed, which at that sound quivered all through; and when
her child was laid at her back, and began caressingly to scramble yet closer,
Aim&eacute;e turned round, and took him to her arms, and lulled him and
soothed him with the soft wont of mother's love.</DD>

<DD>
Before she lost this faint consciousness, which was habit or instinct rather
than thought, Mr Gibson spoke to her in French. The child's one word of
'maman' had given him this clue. It was the language sure to be most intelligible
to her dulled brain; and as it happened, - only Mr Gibson did not think
of that - it was the language in which she had been commanded, and had
learnt to obey.</DD>

<DD>
Mr Gibson's tongue was a little stiff at first, but by-and-by he spoke
it with all his old readiness. He extorted from her short answers at first,
then longer ones, and from time to time he plied her with little drops
of wine, until some further nourishment should be at hand. Molly was struck
by her father's low tones of comfort and sympathy, although she could not
follow what was said quickly enough to catch the meaning of what passed.</DD>

<DD>
By-and-by, however, when her father had done all that he could, and they
were once more downstairs, he told them more about her journey than they
yet knew. The hurry, the sense of acting in defiance of a prohibition,
the over-mastering anxiety, the broken night, and fatigue of the journey,
had ill prepared her for the shock at last, and Mr Gibson was seriously
alarmed for the consequences. She had wandered strangely in her replies
to him; had perceived that she was wandering, and had made great efforts
to recall her senses; but Mr Gibson foresaw that some bodily illness was
coming on, and stopped late that night, arranging many things with Molly
and the squire. One - the only - comfort arising from her state was, the
probability that she would be entirely unconscious by the morrow - the
day of the funeral. Worn out by the contending emotions of the day, the
squire seemed now unable to look beyond the wrench and trial of the next
twelve hours. He sate with his head in his hands, declining to go to bed,
refusing to dwell on the thought of his grandchild - not three hours ago
such a darling in his eyes. Mr Gibson gave some instructions to one of
the maid-servants as to the watch she was to keep by Mrs Osborne Hamley,
and insisted on Molly's going to bed. When she pleaded the apparent necessity
of her staying up, he said, -</DD>

<DD>
'Now, Molly, look how much less trouble the dear old squire would give
if he would obey orders. He is only adding to anxiety by indulging himself.
One pardons everything to extreme grief, however. But you will have enough
to do to occupy all your strength for days to come; and go to bed you must
now. I only wish I saw my way as clearly through other things as I do to
your nearest duty. I wish I'd never let Roger go wandering off; he'll wish
it too, poor fellow! Did I tell you Cynthia is going off in hot haste to
her uncle Kirkpatrick's? I suspect a visit to him will stand in lieu of
going out to Russia as a governess.'</DD>

<DD>
'I am sure she was quite serious in wishing for that.'</DD>

<DD>
'Yes, yes! at the time. I've no doubt she thought she was sincere in intending
to go. But the great thing was to get out of the unpleasantness of the
present time and place; and uncle Kirkpatrick's will do this as effectually,
and more pleasantly, than a situation at Nishni-Novgorod in an ice-palace.'</DD>

<DD>
He had given Molly's thoughts a turn, which was what he wanted to do. Molly
could not help remembering Mr Henderson; and his offer, and all the consequent
hints; and wondering, and wishing - what did she wish? or had she been
falling asleep? Before she had quite ascertained this point she was asleep
in reality.</DD>

<DD>
After this, long days passed over in a monotonous round of care; for no
one seemed to think of Molly's leaving the Hall during the woeful illness
that befell Mrs Osborne Hamley. It was not that her father allowed her
to take much active part in the nursing; the squire gave him <I>carte-blanche</I>,
and he engaged two efficient hospital nurses to watch over the unconscious
Aim&eacute;e; but Molly was needed to receive the finer directions as to
her treatment and diet. It was not that she was wanted for the care of
the little boy; the squire was too jealous of the child's exclusive love
for that, and one of the housemaids was employed in the actual physical
charge of him; but he needed some one to listen to his incontinence of
language, both when his passionate regret for his dead son came uppermost,
and also when he had discovered some extraordinary charm in that son's
child; and again when he was oppressed with the uncertainty of Aim&eacute;e's
long-continued illness. Molly was not so good or so bewitching a listener
to ordinary conversation as Cynthia; but where her heart was interested
her sympathy was deep and unfailing. In this case she only wished that
the squire could really feel that Aim&eacute;e was not the encumbrance
which he evidently considered her to be. Not that he would have acknowledged
the fact, if it had been put before him in plain words. He fought against
the dim consciousness of what was in his mind; he spoke repeatedly of patience
when no one but himself was impatient; he would often say that when she
grew better she must not be allowed to leave the Hall until she was perfectly
strong, when no one was even contemplating the remotest chance of her leaving
her child, excepting only himself. Molly once or twice asked her father
if she might not speak to the squire, and represent the hardship of sending
her away - the improbability that she would consent to quit her boy, and
so on; but Mr Gibson only replied, -</DD>

<DD>
'Wait quietly. Time enough when nature and circumstance have had their
chance, and have failed.'</DD>

<DD>
It was well that Molly was such a favourite with the old servants; for
she had frequently to restrain and to control. To be sure, she had her
father's authority to back her. and they were aware that where her own
comfort, case, or pleasure was concerned she never interfered, but submitted
to their will. If the squire had known of the want of attendance to which
she submitted with the most perfect meekness, as far as she herself was
the only sufferer, he would have gone into a towering rage. But Molly hardly
thought of it, so anxious was she to do all she could for others and to
remember the various charges which her father gave her in his daily visits.
Perhaps he did not spare her enough. she was willing and uncomplaining;
but one day after Mrs Osborne Hamley had 'taken the turn,' as the nurses
called it, when she was lying weak as a new-born baby, but with her faculties
all restored, and her fever gone, when spring buds were blooming out, and
spring birds sang merrily, Molly answered to her father's sudden questioning
that she felt unaccountably weary; that her head ached heavily, and that
she was aware of a sluggishness of thought which it required a painful
effort to overcome.</DD>

<DD>
'Don't go on,' said Mr Gibson, with a quick pang of anxiety, almost of
remorse. 'Lie down here - with your back to the light. I'll come back and
see you before I go.' And off he went in search of the squire. He had a
good long walk before he came upon Mr Hamley in a field of spring wheat,
where the women were weeding, his little grandson holding to his finger
in the intervals of short walks of inquiry into the dirtiest places, which
was all his sturdy little limbs could manage.</DD>

<DD>
'Well, Gibson, and how goes the patient? Better! I wish we could get her
out of doors, such a fine day as it is. It would make her strong as soon
as anything. I used to beg my poor lad to come out more. Maybe, I worried
him; but the air is the finest thing for strengthening that I know of,
Though, perhaps, she'll not thrive in English air as if she'd been born
here; and she'll not be quite right till she gets back to her native place,
wherever that is.'</DD>

<DD>
'I don't know. I begin to think we shall get her quite round here; and
I don't know that she could be in a better place. But it is not about her.
May I order the carriage for my Molly?' Mr Gibson's voice sounded as if
he was choking a little as he said these last words.</DD>

<DD>
'To be sure,' said the squire, setting the child down. He had been holding
him in his arms the last few minutes; but now he wanted all his eyes to
look into Mr Gibson's face. 'I say,' said he, catching hold of Mr Gibson's
arm, 'what's the matter, man? Don't twitch up your face like that, but
speak!'</DD>

<DD>
'Nothing's the matter,' said Mr Gibson, hastily. 'Only I want her at home,
under my own eye;' and he turned away to go to the house, But the squire
left his field and his weeders, and kept at Mr Gibson's side. He wanted
to speak, but his heart was so full he did not know what to say. 'I say,
Gibson,' he got out at last, 'your Molly is liker a child of mine than
a stranger; and I reckon we've all on us been coming too hard upon her.
You don't think there's much amiss, do you?'</DD>

<DD>
'How can I tell?' said Mr Gibson, almost savagely. But any hastiness of
temper was instinctively understood by the squire; and he was not offended,
though he did not speak again till they reached the house. Then he went
to order the carriage, and stood by sorrowful enough while the horses were
being put in. He felt as if he should not know what to do without Molly;
he had never known her value, he thought, till now. But he kept silence
on this view of the case; which was a praiseworthy effort on the part of
one who usually let by-standers see and hear as much of his passing feelings
as if he had had a window in his breast. He stood by while Mr Gibson helped
the faintly-smiling, tearful Molly into the carriage. Then the squire mounted
on the step and kissed her hand; but when he tried to thank her and bless
her, he broke down; and as soon as he was once more safely on the ground
Mr Gibson cried out to the coachman to drive on. And so Molly left Hamley
Hall. From time to time her father rode up to the window, and made some
little cheerful and apparently careless remark. When they came within two
miles of Hollingford he put spurs to his horse, and rode briskly past the
carriage windows, kissing his hand to the occupant as he did so. He went
on to prepare her home for Molly: when she arrived Mrs Gibson was ready
to greet her. Mr Gibson had given one or two of his bright, imperative
orders, and Mrs Gibson was feeling rather lonely without either of her
two dear girls at home, as she phrased it, to herself as well as to others.</DD>

<DD>
'Why, my sweet Molly, this is an unexpected pleasure. Only this morning
I said to papa, "When do you think we shall see our Molly back?" He did
not say much - he never does, you know; but I am sure he thought directly
of giving me this surprise, this pleasure. You're looking a little - what
shall I call it? I remember such a pretty line of poetry, "Oh, call her
fair, not pale!" - so we'll call you fair.'</DD>

<DD>
'You'd better not call her anything, but let her get to her own room and
have a good rest as soon as possible. Haven't you got a trashy novel or
two in the house? That's the literature to send her to sleep.'</DD>

<DD>
He did not leave her till he had seen her laid on a sofa in a darkened
room, with some slight pretence of reading in her hand. Then he came away,
leading his wife, who turned round at the door to kiss her hand to Molly,
and make a little face of unwillingness to be dragged away.</DD>

<DD>
'Now, Hyacinth,' said he, as he took his wife into the drawing-room, 'she
will need much care. She has been overworked, and I've been a fool. That's
all. We must keep her from all worry and care, - but I won't answer for
it that she'll not have an illness, for all that!'</DD>

<DD>
'Poor thing! she does look worn out. She is something like me, her feelings
are too much for her. But now she is come home she shall find us as cheerful
as possible. I can answer for myself; and you really must brighten up your
doleful face, my dear - nothing so bad for invalids as the appearance of
depression in those around them. I have had such a pleasant letter from
Cynthia to-day. Uncle Kirkpatrick really seems to make so much of her,
he treats her just like a daughter; he has given her a ticket to the Concerts
of Ancient Music; and Mr Henderson has been to call on her, in spite of
all that has gone before.'</DD>

<DD>
For an instant, Mr Gibson thought that it was easy enough for his wife
to be cheerful, with the pleasant thoughts and evident anticipations she
had in her mind, but a little more difficult for him to put off his doleful
looks while his own child lay in a state of suffering and illness which
might be the precursor of a still worse malady. But he was always a man
for immediate action as soon as he had resolved on the course to be taken;
and he knew that 'some must watch, while some must sleep; so runs the world
away.'</DD>

<DD>
The illness which he apprehended came upon Molly; not violently or acutely,
so that there was any immediate danger to be dreaded; but making a long
pull upon her strength, which seemed to lessen day by day, until at last
her father feared that she might become a permanent invalid. There was
nothing very decided or alarming to tell Cynthia, and Mrs Gibson kept the
dark side from her in her letters. 'Molly was feeling the spring weather;'
or 'Molly had been a good deal overdone with her stay at the Hall, and
was resting;' such little sentences told nothing of Molly's real state.
But then, as Mrs Gibson said to herself, it would be a pity to disturb
Cynthia's pleasure by telling her much about Molly; indeed there was not
much to tell, one day was so like another. But it so happened that Lady
Harriet, - who came whenever she could to sit awhile with Molly, at first
against Mrs Gibson's will, and afterwards with her full consent, for reasons
of her own - Lady Harriet wrote a letter to Cynthia, to which she was urged
by Mrs Gibson. It fell out in this manner: - One day, when Lady Harriet
was sitting in the drawing-room for a few minutes after she had been with
Molly, she said, -</DD>

<DD>
'Really, Clare, I spend so much time in your house that I am going to establish
a work-basket here. Mary has infected me with her notability, and I am
going to work mamma a footstool. It is to be a surprise; and so if I do
it here she will know nothing about it. Only I cannot match the gold beads
I want for the pansies in this dear little town; and Hollingford, who could
send me down stars and planets if I asked him, I make no doubt, could no
more match beads than -- '</DD>

<DD>
'My dear Lady Harriet! you forget Cynthia! Think what a pleasure it would
be to her to do anything for you.'</DD>

<DD>
'Would it? Then she shall have plenty of it; but, mind, it is you who have
answered for her. She shall get me some wool too; how good I am to confer
so much pleasure on a fellow-creature. But seriously, do you think I might
write and give her a few commissions? Neither Agnes nor Mary are in town
-- '</DD>

<DD>
'I am sure she would be delighted,' said Mrs Gibson, who also took into
consideration the reflection of aristocratic honour that would fall upon
Cynthia if she had a letter from a Lady Harriet while at Mr Kirkpatrick's.
So she gave the address, and Lady Harriet wrote. All the first part of
the letter was taken up with apology and commissions; but then, never doubting
but that Cynthia was aware of Molly's state, she went on to say, -</DD>

<DD>
'I saw Molly this morning. Twice I have been forbidden admittance, as she
was too ill to see any one out of her own family. I wish we could begin
to perceive a change for the better; but she looks more fading every time,
and I fear Mr Gibson considers it a very anxious case.'</DD>

<DD>
The day but one after this letter was despatched, Cynthia walked into the
drawing-room at home with as much apparent composure as if she had left
it not an hour before. Mrs Gibson was dozing, but believing herself to
be reading; she had been with Molly the greater part of the morning, and
now after her lunch, and the invalid's pretence of early dinner, she considered
herself entitled to some repose. She started up as Cynthia came in.</DD>

<DD>
'Cynthia! Dear child, where have you come from? Why in the world have you
come? My poor nerves! My heart is quite fluttering; but, to be sure, it's
no wonder with all this anxiety I have to undergo. Why have you come back?'</DD>

<DD>
'Because of the anxiety you speak of, mamma. I never knew, - you never
told me how ill Molly was.'</DD>

<DD>
'Nonsense. I beg your pardon, my dear, but it's really nonsense. Molly's
illness is only nervous, Mr Gibson says. A nervous fever; but you must
remember nerves are mere fancy, and she's getting better. Such a pity for
you to have left your uncle's. Who told you about Molly?'</DD>

<DD>
'Lady Harriet. She wrote about some wool -- '</DD>

<DD>
'I know, - I know. But you might have known she always exaggerates things,
Not but what I have been almost worn out with nursing. Perhaps after all
it is a very good thing you have come, my dear; and now you shall come
down into the dining-room and have some lunch, and tell me all the Hyde
Park Street news - into my room, - don't go into yours yet - Molly is so
sensitive to noise!'</DD>

<DD>
While Cynthia ate her lunch, Mrs Gibson went on questioning. 'And your
aunt, how is her cold? And Helen, quite strong again? Margaretta as pretty
as ever? The boys are at Harrow, I suppose? And my old favourite, Mr Henderson?'
She could not manage to slip in this last inquiry naturally; in spite of
herself there was a change of tone, an accent of eagerness. Cynthia did
not reply on the instant; she poured herself out some water with great
deliberation, and then said, -</DD>

<DD>
'My aunt is quite well; Helen is as strong as she ever is, and Margaretta
very pretty. The boys are at Harrow, and I conclude that Mr Henderson is
enjoying his usual health, for he was to dine at my uncle's to-day.'</DD>

<DD>
'Take care, Cynthia. Look how you are cutting that gooseberry tart,' said
Mrs Gibson, with sharp annoyance; not provoked by Cynthia's present action,
although it gave excuse for a little vent of temper. 'I can't think how
you could come off in this sudden kind of way; I am sure it must have annoyed
your uncle and aunt. I daresay they'll never ask you again.'</DD>

<DD>
'On the contrary, I am to go back there as soon as ever I can be easy to
leave Molly.'</DD>

<DD>
'"Easy to leave Molly." Now that really is nonsense, and rather uncomplimentary
to me, I must say: nursing her as I have been doing, daily, and almost
nightly; for I have been wakened times out of number by Mr Gibson getting
up, and going to see if she had had her medicine properly.'</DD>

<DD>
'I am afraid she has been very ill?' asked Cynthia.</DD>

<DD>
'Yes, she has, in one way; but not in another. It was what I call more
a tedious, than an interesting illness. There was no immediate danger,
but she lay much in the same state from day to day.'</DD>

<DD>
'I wish I had known!' sighed Cynthia. 'Do you think I might go and see
her now?'</DD>

<DD>
'I'll go and prepare her. You'll find her a good deal better than she has
been. Ah! here's Mr Gibson!' He came into the dining-room, hearing voices.
Cynthia thought that he looked much older.</DD>

<DD>
'You here!' said he, coming forward to shake hands. 'Why, how did you come?'</DD>

<DD>
'By the "Umpire." I never knew Molly had been so ill, or I would have come
directly.' Her eyes were full of tears. Mr Gibson was touched; he shook
her hand again, and murmured, 'You're a good girl, Cynthia.'</DD>

<DD>
'She's heard one of dear Lady Harriet's exaggerated accounts,' said Mrs
Gibson, 'and come straight off. I tell her it's very foolish, for really
Molly is a great deal better now.'</DD>

<DD>
'Very foolish,' said Mr Gibson, echoing his wife's words, but smiling at
Cynthia. 'But sometimes one likes foolish people for their folly, better
than wise people for their wisdom.'</DD>

<DD>
'I am afraid folly always annoys me,' said his wife. 'However, Cynthia
is here, and what is done, is done.'</DD>

<DD>
'Very true, my dear. And now I'll run up and see my little girl, and tell
her the good news. You'd better follow me in a couple of minutes.' This
to Cynthia.</DD>

<DD>
Molly's delight at seeing her showed itself first in a few happy tears;
and then in soft caresses and inarticulate sounds of love. Once or twice
she began, 'It is such a pleasure,' and there she stopped short. But the
eloquence of these five words sank deep into Cynthia's heart. She had returned
just at the right time, when Molly wanted the gentle fillip of the society
of a fresh and yet a familiar person. Cynthia's tact made her talkative
or silent, gay or grave, as the varying humour of Molly required. She listened,
too, with the semblance, if not the reality, of unwearied interest, to
Molly's continual recurrence to all the time of distress and sorrow at
Hamley Hall, and to the scenes which had then so deeply impressed themselves
upon her susceptible nature. Cynthia instinctively knew that the repetition
of all these painful recollections would case the oppressed memory, which
refused to dwell on anything but what had occurred at a time of feverish
disturbance of health. So she never interrupted Molly, as Mrs Gibson had
so frequently done, with, - 'You told me all that before, my dear. Let
us talk of something else;' or, 'Really I cannot allow you to be always
dwelling on painful thoughts. Try and be a little more cheerful. Youth
is gay. You are young, and therefore you ought to be gay. That is put in
a famous form of speech; I forget exactly what it is called.'</DD>

<DD>
So Molly's health and spirits improved rapidly after Cynthia's return;
and although she was likely to retain many of her invalid habits during
the summer, she was able to take drives, and enjoy the fine weather; it
was only her as yet tender spirits that required a little management. All
the Hollingford people forgot that they had ever thought of her except
as the darling of the town; and each in his or her way showed kind interest
in her father's child. Miss Browning and Miss Phoebe considered it quite
a privilege that they were allowed to see her a fortnight or three weeks
before any one else; Mrs Goodenough, spectacles on nose, stirred dainty
messes in a silver saucepan for Molly's benefit; the Towers sent books
and forced fruit, and new caricatures, and strange and delicate poultry;
humble patients of 'the doctor,' as Mr Gibson was usually termed, left
the earliest cauliflowers they could grow in their cottage gardens, with
'their duty for Miss.'</DD>

<DD>
And last of all, though strongest in regard, most piteously eager in interest,
came Squire Hamley himself. When she was at the worst, he rode over every
day to hear the smallest detail, facing even Mrs Gibson (his abomination)
if her husband was not at home, to ask and hear, and ask and hear, till
the tears were unconsciously stealing down his cheeks. Every resource of
his heart, or his house, or his lands was searched and tried, if it could
bring a moment's pleasure to her; and whatever it might be that came from
him, at her very worst time, it brought out a dim smile upon her face.</DD>
