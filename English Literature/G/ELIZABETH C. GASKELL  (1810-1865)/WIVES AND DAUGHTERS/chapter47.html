<P>When Mr Gibson returned to Hollingford, he found an accumulation of
business waiting for him, and he was much inclined to complain of the consequences
of the two days' comparative holiday, which had resulted in over-work for
the week to come. He had hardly time to speak to his family, he had so
immediately to rush off to pressing cases of illness. But Molly managed
to arrest him in the hall, standing there with his great coat held out
ready for him to put on, but whispering as she did so, -

<P>'Papa! Mr Osborne Hamley was here to see you yesterday. He looks very
ill, and he's evidently frightened about himself.'

<P>Mr Gibson faced about, and looked at her for a moment; but all he said
was, -

<P>'I'll go and see him; don't tell your mother where I'm gone: you've
not mentioned this to her, I hope?'

<P>'No,' said Molly, for she had only told Mrs Gibson of Osborne's call,
not of the occasion for it.

<P>'Don't say anything about it: there's no need. Now I think of it, I
can't possibly go to-day, - but I will go.'

<P>Something in her father's manner disheartened Molly, who had persuaded
herself that Osborne's evident illness was partly 'nervous,' by which she
meant imaginary. She had dwelt upon his looks of enjoyment at Miss Phoebe's
perplexity, and thought that no one really believing himself to be in danger
could have given the merry glances which he had done; but after seeing
the seriousness of her father's face, she recurred to the shock she had
experienced on first seeing Osborne's changed appearance. All this time
Mrs Gibson was busy reading a letter from Cynthia which Mr Gibson had brought
from London; for every opportunity of private conveyance was seized upon
when postage was so high; and Cynthia had forgotten so many things in her
hurried packing, that she now sent a list of the clothes which she required.
Molly almost wondered that it had not come to her; but she did not understand
the sort of reserve that was springing up in Cynthia's mind towards her.
Cynthia herself struggled with the feeling, and tried to fight against
it by calling herself 'ungrateful,' but the truth was she believed that
she no longer held her former high place in Molly's estimation and she
could not help turning away from one who knew things to her discredit.
She was fully aware of Molly's prompt decision and willing action, where
action was especially disagreeable, on her behalf; she knew that Molly
would never bring up the past errors and difficulties; but still the consciousness
that the good, straightforward girl had learnt that Cynthia had been guilty
of so much underhand work cooled her regard, and restrained her willingness
of intercourse. Reproach herself with ingratitude as she would, she could
not help feeling glad to be away from Molly; it was awkward to speak to
her as if nothing had happened; it was awkward to write to her about forgotten
ribbons and laces, when their last conversation had been on such different
subjects, and had called out such vehement expressions of feeling. So Mrs
Gibson held the list in her hand, and read out the small fragments of news
that were intermixed with notices of Cynthia's requirements.

<P>'Helen cannot be so very ill,' said Molly at length, 'or Cynthia would
not want her pink muslin and daisy wreath.'

<P>'I don't see that that follows, I'm sure,' replied Mrs Gibson rather
sharply. 'Helen would never be so selfish as to tie Cynthia to her side,
however ill she was. Indeed, I should not have felt that it was my duty
to let Cynthia go to London at all, if I had thought she was to be perpetually
exposed to the depressing atmosphere of a sick-room. Besides, it must be
so good for Helen to have Cynthia coming in with bright pleasant accounts
of the parties she has been to - even if Cynthia disliked gaiety I should
desire her to sacrifice herself and go out as much as she could, for Helen's
sake. My idea of nursing is that one should not be always thinking of one's
own feelings and wishes, but doing those things which will most serve to
beguile the weary hours of an invalid. But then so few people have had
to consider the subject so deeply as I have done!' Mrs Gibson here thought
fit to sigh before going on with Cynthia's letter. As far as Molly could
make any sense out of this rather incoherent epistle, very incoherently
read aloud to her, Cynthia was really pleased and glad to be of use and
comfort to Helen, but at the same time very ready to be easily persuaded
into the perpetual small gaieties which abounded in her uncle's house in
London, even at this dead season of the year. Mrs Gibson came upon Mr Henderson's
name once, and then went on with a running um-um-um to herself, which sounded
very mysterious, but which might as well have been omitted, as all that
Cynthia really said about him was, 'Mr Henderson's mother has advised my
aunt to consult a certain Dr Donaldson, who is said to be very clever in
such cases as Helen's, but my uncle is not sufficiently sure of the professional
etiquette, &amp;c.' Then there came a very affectionate, carefully worded
message to Molly, - implying a good deal more than was said of loving gratitude
for the trouble she had taken on Cynthia's behalf. And that was all; and
Molly went away a little depressed; she knew not why.

<P>The operation on Lady Cumnor had been successfully performed, and in
a few days they hoped to bring her down to the Towers to recruit her strength
in the fresh country air; the case was one which interested Mr Gibson extremely,
and in which his opinion had been proved to be right, in opposition to
that of one or two great names in London. The consequence was that he was
frequently consulted and referred to during the progress of her recovery;
and, as he had much to do in the immediate circle of his Hollingford practice,
as well as to write thoughtful letters to his medical brethren in London,
he found it difficult to spare the three or four hours necessary to go
over to Hamley to see Osborne. He wrote to him, however, begging him to
reply immediately and detail his symptoms; and from the answer he received
he did not imagine that the case was immediately pressing. Osborne, too,
deprecated his coming over to Hamley for the express purpose of seeing
him. So the visit was deferred to that more convenient season which is
so often too late.

<P>All these days the buzzing gossip about Molly's meetings with Mr Preston,
her clandestine correspondence, the t&ecirc;te-?t&ecirc;te interviews in
lonot ely places, had been gathering strength, and assuming the positive
form of scandal. The simple innocent girl, who walked through the quiet
streets without a thought of being the object of mysterious implications,
became for a time the unconscious black sheep of the town. Servants heard
part of what was said in their mistresses' drawing-rooms, and exaggerated
the sayings amongst themselves with the coarse strengthening of expression
common amongst uneducated people. Mr Preston himself became aware that
her name was being coupled with his, though hardly to the extent to which
the love of excitement and gossip had carried people's speeches; he chuckled
over the mistake, but took no pains to correct it. 'It serves her right,'
said he to himself, 'for meddling with other folk's business,' and he felt
himself avenged for the discomfiture which her menace of appealing to Lady
Harriet had caused him, and the mortification he had experienced in learning
from her plain-speaking lips, how he had been talked over by Cynthia and
herself, with personal dislike on the one side, and evident contempt on
the other. Besides, if any denial of Mr Preston's stirred up an examination
as to the real truth, more might come out of his baffled endeavours to
compel Cynthia to keep to her engagement to him than he cared to have known.
He was angry with himself for still loving Cynthia; loving her in his own
fashion, be it understood. He told himself that many a woman of more position
and wealth would be glad enough to have him; some of them pretty women
too. And he asked himself why he was such a confounded fool as to go on
hankering after a penniless girl, who was as fickle as the wind? The answer
was silly enough, logically; but forcible in fact. Cynthia was Cynthia,
and not Venus herself could have been her substitute. In this one thing
Mr Preston was more really true than many worthy men; who, seeking to be
married, turn with careless facility from the unattainable to the attainable,
and keep their feelings and fancy tolerably loose till they find a woman
who consents to be their wife. But no one would ever be to Mr Preston what
Cynthia had been, and was; and yet he could have stabbed her in certain
of his moods. So, Molly, who had come between him and the object of his
desire, was not likely to find favour in his sight, or to obtain friendly
actions from him.

<P>There came a time - not very distant from the evening at Mrs Dawes'
- when Molly felt that people looked askance at her. Mrs Goodenough openly
pulled her grand-daughter away, when the young girl stopped to speak to
Molly in the street, and an engagement which the two had made for a long
walk together was cut very short by a very trumpery excuse. Mrs Goodenough
explained her conduct in the following manner to some of her friends, -

<P>'You see, I don't think the worse of a girl for meeting her sweetheart
here and there and everywhere, till she gets talked about; but then when
she does - and Molly Gibson's name is in everybody's mouth - I think it's
only fair to Bessy, who has trusted me with Annabella, not to let her daughter
be seen with a lass who has managed her matters so badly, as to set folk
talking about her. My maxim is this, - and it's a very good working one,
you may depend on't - women should mind what they're about, and never be
talked of; and if a woman's talked of, the less her friends have to do
with her till the talk has died away, the better. So Annabella is not to
have anything to do with Molly Gibson, this visit at any rate.'

<P>For a good while the Miss Brownings were kept in ignorance of the evil
tongues that whispered hard words about Molly. Miss Browning was known
to 'have a temper,' and by instinct every one who came in contact with
her shrank from irritating that temper by uttering the slightest syllable
against the smallest of those creatures over whom she spread the &aelig;gis
of her love. She would and did reproach them herself; she used to boast
that she never spared them: but no one else might touch them with the slightest
slur of a passing word. But Misse Phoebe inspired no such terror; the great
reason why she did not hear of the gossip against Molly as early as any
one, was that, although she was not the rose, she lived near the rose.
Besides, she was of so tender a nature that even thick-skinned Mrs Goodenough
was unwilling to say what would give Miss Phoebe pain; and it was the new-comer
Mrs Dawes, who in all ignorance alluded to the town's talk, as to something
of which Miss Phoebe must be aware. Then Miss Phoebe poured down her questions,
although she protested, even with tears, her total disbelief in all the
answers she received. It was a small act of heroism on her part to keep
all that she there learnt a secret from her sister Sally, as she did for
four or five days; till Miss Browning attacked her one evening with the
following speech, -

<P>'Phoebe! either you've some reason for puffing yourself out with sighs,
or you've not. If you have a reason, it's your duty to tell it me directly;
and if you've no reason, you must break yourself of a bad habit that is
growing upon you.'

<P>'Oh, sister! do you think it is really my duty to tell you? it would
be such a comfort; but then I thought I ought not; it will distress you
so.'

<P>'Nonsense. I am so well prepared for misfortune by the frequent contemplation
of its possibility that I believe I can receive any ill news with apparent
equanimity and real resignation. Besides, when you said yesterday at breakfast-time
that you meant to give up the day to making your drawers tidy, I was aware
that some misfortune was impending, though of course I could not judge
of its magnitude. Is the Highchester Bank broken?'

<P>'Oh no, sister!' said Miss Phoebe, moving to a seat close to her sister's
on the sofa. 'Have you really been thinking that! I wish I had told you
what I heard at the very first, if you've been fancying that!'

<P>'Take warning, Phoebe, and learn to have no concealments from me. I
did think we must be ruined, from your ways of going on; eating no meat
at dinner, and sighing continually. And now what is it?'

<P>'I hardly know how to tell you, Sally. I really don't.'

<P>Miss Phoebe began to cry; Miss Browning took hold of her arm, and gave
her a little sharp shake.

<P>'Cry as much as you like when you've told me; but don't cry now, child,
when you're keeping me on the tenterhooks.'

<P>'Molly Gibson has lost her character, sister. That's it.'

<P>'Molly Gibson has done no such thing!' said Miss Browning indignantly.
'How dare you repeat such stories about poor Mary's child! Never let me
hear you say such things again!'

<P>'I can't help it. Mrs Dawes told me; and she says it's all over the
town. I told her I did not believe a word of it. And I kept it from you;
and I think I should have been really ill if I'd kept it to myself any
longer. Oh, sister! what are you going to do?'

<P>For Miss Browning had risen without speaking a word, and was leaving
the room in a stately and determined fashion.

<P>'I am going to put on my bonnet and things, and then I shall call upon
Mrs Dawes, and confront her with her lies.'

<P>'Oh, don't call them "lies," sister; it's such a strong, ugly word.
Please call them "tallydiddles," for I don't believe she meant any harm.
Besides - besides - if they should turn out to be truth! Really, sister,
that's the weight on my mind; so many things sounded as if they might be
true.'

<P>'What things?' said Miss Browning, still standing with judicial erectness
of position in the middle of the floor.

<P>'Why - one story was that Molly had given him a letter.'

<P>'Who's him? How am I to understand a story told in that silly way?'
Miss Browning sate down on the nearest chair, and made up her mind to be
patient if she could.

<P>'Him is Mr Preston. And that must be true; because I missed her from
my side when I wanted to ask her if she thought blue would look green by
candlelight, as the young man said it would, and she had run across the
street, and Mrs Goodenough was just going into the shop, just as she said
she was.'

<P>Miss Browning's distress was overcoming her anger; so she only said,
'Phoebe, I think you'll drive me mad. Do tell me what you heard from Mrs
Dawes in a sensible and coherent manner, for once in your life.'

<P>'I'm sure I'm trying with all my might to tell you everything just as
it happened.'

<P>'What did you hear from Mrs Dawes?'

<P>'Why, that Molly and Mr Preston were keeping company just as if she
was a maid-servant and he was a gardener; meeting at all sorts of improper
times and places, and fainting away in his arms, and out at night together,
and writing to each other, and slipping their letters into each other's
hands; and that was what I was talking about, sister, for I next door to
saw that done once. I saw her with my own eyes run across the street to
Grinstead's, where he was, for we had just left him there; with a letter
in her hand, too, which was not there when she came back all fluttered
and blushing. But I never thought anything of it at the time; but now all
the town is talking about it, and crying shame, and saying they ought to
be married.' Miss Phoebe sank, into sobbing again; but was suddenly roused
by a good box on her car. Miss Browning was standing over her almost trembling
with passion.

<P>'Phoebe, if ever I hear you say such things again, I'll turn you out
of the house that minute.'

<P>'I only said what Mrs Dawes said, and you asked me what it was,' replied
Miss Phoebe, humbly and meekly. 'Sally, you should not have done that.'

<P>'Never mind whether I should or I shouldn't. That's not the matter in
hand. What I've got to decide is how to put a stop to all these lies.'

<P>'But, Sally, they are not all lies - if you will call them so; I'm afraid
some things are true; though I stuck to their being false when Mrs Dawes
told me of them.'

<P>'If I go to Mrs Dawes, and she repeats them to me, I shall slap her
face or box her ears I'm afraid, for I couldn't stand tales being told
of poor Mary's daughter, as if they were just a, stirring piece of news
like James Horrocks' pig with two heads,' said Miss Browning, meditating
aloud. 'That would do harm instead of good. Phoebe, I'm really sorry I
boxed your ears, only I should do it again if you said the same things.'
Phoebe sate down by her sister, and took hold of one of her withered hands,
and began caressing it, which was her way of accepting her sister's expression
of regret. 'If I speak to Molly, the child will deny it, if she's half
as good-for-nothing as they say; and if she's not, she'll only worry herself
to death. No, that won't do. Mrs Goodenough - but she's a donkey; and if
I convinced her, she could never convince any one else. No; Mrs Dawes,
who told you, shall tell me, and I'll tie my hands together inside my muff,
and bind myself over to keep the peace. And when I've heard what is to
be heard, I'll put the matter into Mr Gibson's hands. That's what I'll
do. So it's no use your saying anything against it, Phoebe, for I shan't
attend to you.'

<P>Miss Browning went to Mrs Dawes', and began civilly enough to make inquiries
about the reports current in Hollingford about Molly and Mr Preston; and
Mrs Dawes fell into the snare, and told all the real and fictitious circumstances
of the story in circulation, quite unaware of the storm that was gathering
and ready to fall upon her as soon as she stopped speaking. But she had
not the long habit of reverence for Miss Browning which would have kept
so many Hollingford ladies from justifying themselves if she found fault.
Mrs Dawes stood up for herself and her own veracity, bringing out fresh
scandal, which she said she did not believe, but that many did; and adducing
so much evidence as to the truth of what she had said and did believe,
that Miss Browning was almost quelled, and sate silent and miserable at
the end of Mrs Dawes' justification of herself.

<P>'Well!' she said at length, rising up from her chair as she spoke, 'I'm
very sorry I've lived till this day; it's a blow to me just as if I had
heard of such goings-on in my own flesh and blood. I suppose I ought to
apologize to you, Mrs Dawes, for what I said; but I've no heart to do it
to-day. I ought not to have spoken as I did; but that's nothing to this
affair, you see.'

<P>'I hope you do me the justice to perceive that I only repeated what
I had heard on good authority, Miss Browning,' said Mrs Dawes in reply.

<P>'My dear, don't repeat evil on any authority unless you can do some
good by speaking about it,' said Miss Browning, laying her hand on Mrs
Dawes' shoulder. 'I'm not a good woman, but I know what is good, and that
advice is. And now I think I can tell you that I beg your pardon for flying
out upon you so; but God knows what pain you were putting me to. You'll
forgive me, won't you, my dear?' Mrs Dawes felt the hand trembling on her
shoulder, and saw the real distress of Miss Browning's mind, so it was
not difficult to her to grant the requested forgiveness. Then Miss Browning
went home, and said but few words to Phoebe, who indeed saw well enough
that her sister had heard the reports confirmed, and needed no further
explanation of the cause of scarcely-tasted dinner, and short replies,
and saddened looks. Presently Miss Browning sate down and wrote a short
note. Then she rang the bell, and told the little maiden who answered it
to take it to Mr Gibson, and if he was out to see that it was given to
him as soon as ever he came home. And then she went and put on her Sunday
cap; and Miss Phoebe knew that her sister had written to ask Mr Gibson
to come and be told of the rumours affecting his daughter. Miss Browning
was sadly disturbed at the information she had received, and the task that
lay before her; she was miserably uncomfortable to herself and irritable
to Miss Phoebe, and the netting-cotton she was using kept continually snapping
and breaking from the jerks of her nervous hands. When the knock at the
door was heard, - the well-known doctor's knock, - Miss Browning took off
her spectacles, and dropped them on the carpet, breaking them as she did
so; and then she bade Miss Phoebe leave the room, as if her presence had
cast the evil-eye, and caused the misfortune. She wanted to look natural,
and was distressed at forgetting whether she usually received him sitting
or standing.

<P>'Well!' said he, coming in cheerfully, and rubbing his cold hands as
he went straight to the fire, 'and what is the matter with us? It's Phoebe,
I suppose. I hope none of those old spasms? But, after all, a dose or two
will set that to rights.'

<P>'Oh! Mr Gibson, I wish it was Phoebe, or me either!' said Miss Browning,
trembling more and more.

<P>He sate down by her patiently, when he saw her agitation, and took her
hand in a kind, friendly manner.

<P>'Don't hurry yourself, - take your time. I daresay it's not so bad as
you fancy; but we'll see about it. There's a great deal of help in the
world, much as we abuse it.'

<P>'Mr Gibson,' said she, 'it's your Molly I'm so grieved about. It's out
now, and God help us both, and the poor child too, for I'm sure she's been
led astray, and not gone wrong by her own free will!'

<P>'Molly!' said he, fighting against her words. 'What's my little Molly
been doing or saying?'

<P>'Oh! Mr Gibson, I don't know how to tell you. I never would have named
it, if I had not been convinced, sorely, sorely against my will.'

<P>'At any rate, you can let me hear what you have heard,' said he, putting
his elbow on the table, and screening his eyes with his hand. 'Not that
I am a bit afraid of anything you can hear about my girl,' continued he.
'Only in this little nest of gossip it's as well to know what people are
talking about.'

<P>'They say - oh! how shall I tell you?'

<P>'Go on, can't you?' said he, removing his hand from his blazing eyes.
'I'm not going to believe it, so don't be afraid!'

<P>'But I fear you must believe it. I would not if I could help it. She's
been carrying on a clandestine correspondence with Mr Preston! -- '

<P>'Mr Preston!' exclaimed he.

<P>'And meeting him at all sorts of unseemly places and hours out of doors,
- in the dark, - fainting away in his - his arms, if I must speak out.
All the town is talking of it.' Mr Gibson's hand was over his eyes again,
and he made no sign; so Miss Browning went on, adding touch to touch. 'Mr
Sheepshanks saw them together. They have exchanged notes in Grinstead's
shop; she ran after him there.'

<P>'Be quiet, can't you?' said Mr Gibson, taking his hand away, and showing
his grim set face. 'I have heard enough. Don't go on. I said I shouldn't
believe it, and I don't. I suppose I must thank you for telling me; but
I can't yet.'

<P>'I don't want your thanks,' said Miss Browning, almost crying. 'I thought
you ought to know; for though you're married again, I can't forget you
were dear Mary's husband once upon a time; and Molly's her child.'

<P>'I'd rather not speak any more about it just at present,' said he, not
at all replying to Miss Browning's last speech. 'I may not control myself
as I ought. I only wish I could meet Preston, and horsewhip him within
an inch of his life. I wish I'd the doctoring of these slanderous gossips.
I'd make their tongues lie still for a while. My little girl! What harm
has she done them all, that they should go and foul her fair name.'

<P>'Indeed, Mr Gibson, I'm afraid it's all true. I would not have sent
for you if I hadn't examined into it. Do ascertain the truth before you
do anything violent, such as horsewhipping or poisoning.'

<P>With all the incons&eacute;quence of a man in a passion, Mr Gibson laughed
out, 'What have I said about horsewhipping or poisoning? Do you think I'd
have Molly's name dragged about the stree ts in connection with any act
of violence on my part. Let the report die away as it arose. Time will
prove its falsehood.'

<P>'But I don't think it will, and that's the pity of it,' said Miss Browning.
'You must do something, but I don't know what.'

<P>'I shall go home and ask Molly herself what's the meaning of it all;
that's all I shall do. It's too ridiculous - knowing Molly as I do, it's
perfectly ridiculous.' He got up and walked about the room with hasty steps,
laughing short unnatural laughs from time to time. 'Really what will they
say next? "Satan finds some mischief still for idle tongues to do."'

<P>'Don't talk of Satan, please, in this house. No one knows what may happen,
if he's lightly spoken about,' pleaded Miss Browning.

<P>He went on, without noticing her, talking to himself, - 'I've a great
mind to leave the place; - and what food for scandal that piece of folly
would give rise to!' Then he was silent for a time; his hands in his pockets,
his eyes on the ground, as he continued his quarter-deck march. Suddenly
he stopped close to Miss Browning's chair. 'I'm thoroughly ungrateful to
you, for as true a mark of friendship as you've ever shown to me. True
or false, it was right I should know the wretched scandal that was being
circulated; and it could not have been pleasant for you to tell it me.
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.'

<P>'Indeed, Mr Gibson, if it was false I would never have named it, but
let it die away.'

<P>'It's not true though!' said he, doggedly, letting drop the hand he
had taken in his effusion of gratitude.

<P>She shook her head. 'I shall always love Molly for her mother's sake,'
she said. And it was a great concession from the correct Miss Browning.
But her father did not understand it as such.

<P>'You ought to love her for her own. She has done nothing to disgrace
herself. I shall go straight home, and probe into the truth.'

<P>'As if the poor girl who has been led away into deceit already would
scruple much at going on in falsehood,' was Miss Browning's remark on this
last speech of Mr Gibson's; but she had discretion enough not to make it
until he was well out of hearing.
