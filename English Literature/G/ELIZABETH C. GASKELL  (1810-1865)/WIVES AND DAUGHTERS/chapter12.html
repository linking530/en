<DD>
Meanwhile the love-affairs between the middle-aged couple were prospering
well, after a fashion; after the fashion that they liked best, although
it might probably have appeared dull and prosaic to younger people. Lord
Cumnor had come down in great glee at the news he had heard from his wife
at the Towers. He, too, seemed to think he had taken an active part in
bringing about the match by only speaking about it. His first words on
the subject to Lady Cumnor were, -</DD>

<DD>
'I told you so. Now didn't I say what a good, suitable thing this affair
between Gibson and Clare would be! I don't know when I have been so much
pleased. You may despise the trade of match-maker, my lady, but I am very
proud of it. After this, I shall go on looking out for suitable cases among
the middle-aged people of my acquaintance. I shan't meddle with young folks,
they are so apt to be fanciful; but I have been so successful in this,
that I do think it is a good encouragement to go on.'</DD>

<DD>
'Go on - with what?' asked Lady Cumnor, drily.</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, planning - You can't deny that I planned this match.'</DD>

<DD>
'I don't think you are likely to do either much good or harm by planning,'
she replied, with cool, good sense.</DD>

<DD>
'It puts it into people's heads, my dear.'</DD>

<DD>
'Yes, if you speak about your plans to them, of course it does. But in
this case you never spoke to either Mr Gibson, or Clare, did you?'</DD>

<DD>
All at once the recollection of how Clare had come upon the passage in
Lord Cumnor's letter flashed on his lady, but she did not say anything
about it, but left her husband to flounder about as best he might.</DD>

<DD>
'No! I never spoke to them; of course not.'</DD>

<DD>
'Then you must be strongly mesmeric, and your will acted upon theirs, if
you are to take credit for any part in the affair,' continued his pitiless
wife.</DD>

<DD>
'I really can't say. It's no use looking back to what I said or did. I'm
very well satisfied with it, and that's enough, and I mean to show them
how much I'm pleased. I shall give Clare something towards her rigging
out, and they shall have a breakfast at Ashcombe Manor-house. I'll write
to Preston about it. When did you say they were to be married?'</DD>

<DD>
'I think they'd better wait till Christmas, and I have told them so. It
would amuse the children, going over to Ashcombe for the wedding; and if
it's bad weather during the holidays I'm always afraid of their finding
it dull at the Towers. It's very different if it's a good frost, and they
can go out skating and sledging in the park. But these last two years it
has been so wet for them, poor dears!'</DD>

<DD>
'And will the other poor dears be content to wait to make a holiday for
your grandchildren? "To make a Roman holiday." Pope, or somebody else,
had a line of poetry like that. "To make a Roman holiday,"' - he repeated,
pleased with his unusual aptitude at quotation.</DD>

<DD>
'It's Byron, and it's nothing to do with the subject in hand. I'm surprised
at your lordship's quoting Byron, - he was a very immoral poet.'</DD>

<DD>
'I saw him take his oaths in the House of Lords,' said Lord Cumnor, apologetically.</DD>

<DD>
'Well! the less said about him the better,' said Lady Cumnor. 'I have told
Clare that she had better not think of being married before Christmas;
and it won't do for her to give up her school in a hurry either.'</DD>

<DD>
But Clare did not intend to wait till Christmas; and for this once she
carried her point against the will of the countess, and without many words,
or any open opposition. She had a harder task in setting aside Mr Gibson's
desire to have Cynthia over for the wedding, even if she went back to her
school at Boulogne directly after the ceremony. At first she had said that
it would be delightful, a charming plan; only she feared that she must
give up her own wishes to have her child near her at such a time, on account
of the expense of the double journey.</DD>

<DD>
But Mr Gibson, economical as he was in his habitual expenditure, had a
really generous heart. He had already shown it, in entirely relinquishing
his future wife's life-interest in the very small property the late Mr
Kirkpatrick had left, in favour of Cynthia; while he arranged that she
should come to his home as a daughter as soon as she left the school she
was at. The life-interest was about thirty pounds a year. Now he gave Mrs
Kirkpatrick three five-pound notes, saying that he hoped they would do
away with the objections to Cynthia's coming over to the wedding; and at
the time Mrs Kirkpatrick felt as if they would, and caught the reflection
of his strong wish, and fancied it was her own. If the letter could have
been written and the money sent off that day while the reflected glow of
affection lasted, Cynthia would have been bridesmaid to her mother. But
a hundred little interruptions came in the way of letter-writing; and by
the next day maternal love had diminished; and the value affixed to the
money had increased: money had been so much needed, so hardly earned in
Mrs Kirkpatrick's life; while the perhaps necessary separation of mother
and child had lessened the amount of affection the former had to bestow.
So she persuaded herself, afresh, that it would be unwise to disturb Cynthia
at her studies; to interrupt the fulfilment of her duties just after the
<I>semestre</I> had begun afresh; and she wrote a letter to Madame Lefevre
so well imbued with this persuasion, that an answer which was almost an
echo of her words was returned, the sense of which being conveyed to Mr
Gibson, who was no great French scholar, settled the vexed question, to
his moderate but unfeigned regret. But the fifteen pounds were not returned.
Indeed, not merely that sum, but a great part of the hundred which Lord
Cumnor had given her for her trousseau, was required to pay off debts at
Ashcombe; for the school had been anything but flourishing since Mrs Kirkpatrick
had had it. It was really very much to her credit that she preferred clearing
herself from debt to purchasing wedding finery. But it was one of the few
points to be respected in Mrs Kirkpatrick that she had always been careful
in payment to the shops where she dealt; it was a little sense of duty
cropping out. Whatever other faults might arise from her superficial and
flimsy character, she was always uneasy till she was out of debt. Yet she
had no scruple in appropriating her future husband's money to her own use,
when it was decided that it was not to be employed as he intended. What
new articles she bought for herself, were all such as would make a show,
and an impression upon the ladies of Hollingford. She argued with herself
that linen, and all underclothing, would never be seen, while she knew
that every gown she had, would give rise to much discussion and would be
counted up in the little town.</DD>

<DD>
So her stock of 'underclothing was very small, and scarcely any of it new;
but it was made of dainty material, and was finely mended up by her deft
fingers, many a night long after her pupils were in bed; inwardly resolving
all the time she sewed, that hereafter some one else should do her plain-work.
Indeed, many a little circumstance of former subjection to the will of
others rose up before her during these quiet hours, as an endurance or
a suffering never to occur again. So apt are people to look forward to
a different kind of life from that to which they have been accustomed,
as being free from care and trial! She recollected how, one time during
this very summer at the Towers, after she was engaged to Mr Gibson, when
she had taken above an hour to arrange her hair in some new mode carefully
studied from Mrs Bradley's fashion-book - after all, when she came down,
looking her very best, as she thought, and ready for her lover, Lady Cumnor
had sent her back again to her room, just as if she had been a little child,
to do her hair over again, and not to make such a figure of fun of herself!
Another time she had been sent to change her gown for one in her opinion
far less becoming, but which suited Lady Cumnor's taste better. These were
little things; but they were late samples of what in different shapes she
had had to endure for many years; and her liking for Mr Gibson grew in
proportion to her sense of the evils from which he was going to serve as
a means of escape. After all, that interval of hope and plain-sewing, intermixed
though it was by tuition, was not disagreeable. Her wedding-dress was secure.
Her former pupils at the Towers were going to present her with that; they
were to dress her from head to foot on the auspicious day. Lord Cumnor,
as has been said, had given her a hundred pounds for her trousseau, and
had sent Mr Preston a <I>carte-blanche</I> order for the wedding-breakfast
in the old hall in Ashcombe Manor-house. Lady Cumnor - a little put out
by the marriage not being deferred till her grandchildren's Christmas holidays
- had nevertheless given Mrs Kirkpatrick an excellent English-made watch
and chain; more clumsy but more serviceable than the little foreign elegance
that had hung at her side so long, and misled her so often.</DD>

<DD>
Her preparations were thus in a very considerable state of forwardness,
while Mr Gibson had done nothing as yet towards any new arrangement or
decoration of his house for his intended bride. He knew he ought to do
something. But what? Where to begin, when so much was out of order, and
he had so little time for superintendence? At length he came to the wise
decision of asking one of the Miss Brownings to take the trouble of preparing
all that was immediately requisite in his house, for old friendship's sake;
and resolved to leave all the more ornamental decorations that he proposed,
to the taste of his future wife. But before making his request to the Miss
Brownings he had to tell them of his engagement, which had hitherto been
kept a secret from the townspeople, who had set down his frequent visits
at the Towers to the score of the countess's health. He felt how he should
have laughed in his sleeve at any middle-aged widower who came to him with
a confession of the kind he had now to make to the Miss Brownings, and
disliked the idea of the necessary call: but it was to be done, so one
evening he went in (promiscuous,' as they called it, and told them his
story. At the end of the first chapter - that is to say, at the end of
the story of Mr Coxe's calf-love, Miss Browning held up her hands in surprise.</DD>

<DD>
'To think of Molly, as I have held in long-clothes, coming to have a lover!
Well, to be sure! Sister Phoebe - ' (she was just coming into the room),
'here's a piece of news! Molly Gibson has got a lover! One may almost say
she's had an offer! Mr Gibson, may not one? - and she's but sixteen!'</DD>

<DD>
'Seventeen, sister,' said Miss Phoebe, who piqued herself on knowing all
about dear Mr Gibson's domestic affairs. 'Seventeen, the 22nd of last June.'</DD>

<DD>
'Well, have it your own way. Seventeen, if you like to call her so!' said
Miss Browning, impatiently. 'The fact is still the same - she's got a lover;
and it seems to me she was in long-clothes only yesterday.'</DD>

<DD>
'I'm sure I hope her course of true love will run smooth,' said Miss Phoebe.</DD>

<DD>
Now Mr Gibson came in; for his story was not half told, and he did not
want them to run away too far with the idea of Molly's love-affair.</DD>

<DD>
'Molly knows nothing about it. I haven't even named it to any one but you
two, and to one other friend. I trounced Coxe well, and did my best to
keep his attachment - as he calls it - in bounds. But I was sadly puzzled
what to do about Molly. Miss Eyre was away, and I couldn't leave them in
the house together without any older woman.'</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, Mr Gibson! why did you not send her to us?' broke in Miss Browning.
'We would have done anything in our power for you; for your sake, as well
as her poor dear mother's.'</DD>

<DD>
'Thank you. I know you would, but it wouldn't have done to have had her
in Hollingford, just at the time of Coxe's effervescence. He's better now.
His appetite has come back with double force, after the fasting he thought
it right to exhibit. He had three helpings of blackcurrant dumpling yesterday.'</DD>

<DD>
'I am sure you are most liberal, Mr Gibson. Three helpings! And, I daresay,
butcher's meat in proportion?'</DD>

<DD>
'Oh! I only named it because, with such very young men, it's generally
see-saw between appetite and love, and I thought the third helping a very
good sign. But still, you know, what has happened once, may happen again.'</DD>

<DD>
'I don't know. Phoebe had an offer of marriage once -- ' said Miss Browning.</DD>

<DD>
'Hush! sister. It might hurt his feelings to have it spoken about.'</DD>

<DD>
'Nonsense, child! It's five-and-twenty years ago; and his eldest daughter
is married herself.'</DD>

<DD>
'I own he has not been constant,' pleaded Miss Phoebe, in her tender, piping
voice. 'All men are not - like you, Mr Gibson - faithful to the memory
of their first love.'</DD>

<DD>
Mr Gibson winced. Jeanie was his first love; but her name had never been
breathed in Hollingford. His wife - good, pretty, sensible, and beloved
as she had been - was not his second; no, nor his third love. And now he
was come to make a confidence about his second marriage.</DD>

<DD>
'Well, well,' said he; 'at any rate, I thought I must do something to protect
Molly from such affairs while she was so young, and before I had given
my sanction. Miss Eyre's little nephew fell ill of scarlet fever -- '</DD>

<DD>
'Ah! by-the-by, how careless of me not to inquire. How is the poor little
fellow?'</DD>

<DD>
'Worse - better. It doesn't signify to what I've got to say now; the fact
was, Miss Eyre couldn't come back to my house for some time, and I cannot
leave Molly altogether at Hamley.'</DD>

<DD>
'Ah! I see now, why there was that sudden visit to Hamley. Upon my word,
it's quite a romance.'</DD>

<DD>
'I do like hearing of a love-affair,' murmured Miss Phoebe.</DD>

<DD>
'Then if you'll let me get on with my story, you shall hear of mine,' said
Mr Gibson, quite beyond his patience with their constant interruptions.</DD>

<DD>
'Yours!' said Miss Phoebe, faintly.</DD>

<DD>
'Bless us and save us!' said Miss Browning, with less sentiment in her
tone; 'what next?'</DD>

<DD>
'My marriage, I hope,' said Mr Gibson, choosing to take her expression
of intense surprise literally. 'And that's what I came to speak to you
about.'</DD>

<DD>
A little hope darted up in Miss Phoebe's breast. She had often said to
her sister, in the confidence of curling-time (ladies wore curls in those
days), 'that the only man who could ever bring her to think of matrimony
was Mr Gibson; but that if he ever proposed, she should feel bound to accept
him, for poor dear Mary's sake;' never explaining what exact style of satisfaction
she imagined she should give to her dead friend by marrying her late husband.
Phoebe played nervously with the strings of her black silk apron. Like
the Caliph in the Eastern story, a whole lifetime of possibilities passed
through her mind in an instant, of which possibilities the question of
questions was, Could she leave her sister? Attend, Phoebe, to the present
moment, and listen to what is being said before you distress yourself with
a perplexity which will never arise.</DD>

<DD>
'Of course it has been an anxious thing for me to decide who I should ask
to be the mistress of my family, the mother of my girl; but I think I've
decided rightly at last. The lady I have chosen -- '</DD>

<DD>
'Tell us at once who she is, there's a good man,' said straightforward
Miss Browning.</DD>

<DD>
'Mrs Kirkpatrick,' said the bridegroom elect.</DD>

<DD>
'What! the governess at the Towers, that the countess makes so much of?'</DD>

<DD>
'Yes; she is much valued by them - and deservedly so. She keeps a school
now at Ashcombe, and is accustomed to housekeeping. She has brought up
the young ladies at the Towers, and has a daughter of her own, therefore
it is probable she will have a kind, motherly feeling towards Molly.'</DD>

<DD>
'She's a very elegant-looking woman,' said Miss Phoebe, feeling it incumbent
upon her to say something laudatory, by way of concealing the thoughts
that had just been passing through her mind. 'I've seen her in the carriage,
riding backwards with the countess; a very pretty woman, I should say.'</DD>

<DD>
'Nonsense, sister,' said Miss Browning. 'What has her elegance or prettiness
to do with the affair? Did you ever know a widower marry again for such
trifles as those? It's always from a sense of duty of one kind or another
- isn't it, Mr Gibson? They want a housekeeper; or they want a mother for
their children; or they think their last wife would have liked it.'</DD>

<DD>
Perhaps the thought had passed through the elder sister's mind that Phoebe
might have been chosen for there was a sharp acrimony in her tone; not
unfamiliar to Mr Gibson, but with which he did not choose to cope at this
present moment.</DD>

<DD>
'You must have it your own way, Miss Browning. Settle my motives for me.
I don't pretend to be quite clear about them myself. But I am clear in
wishing heartily to keep my old friends, and for them to love my future
wife for my sake. I don't know any two women in the world, except Molly
and Mrs Kirkpatrick, I regard as much as I do you. Besides, I want to ask
you if you will let Molly come and stay with you till after my marriage?'</DD>

<DD>
'You might have asked us before you asked Madam Hamley,' said Miss Browning,
only half mollified. 'We are your old friends; and we were her mother's
friends, too; though we are not county folk.'</DD>

<DD>
'That's unjust,' said Mr Gibson. 'And you know it is.'</DD>

<DD>
'I don't know. You are always with Lord Hollingford, when you can get at
him, much more than you ever are with Mr Goodenough, or Mr Smith. And you
are always going over to Hamley.'</DD>

<DD>
Miss Browning was not one to give in all at once.</DD>

<DD>
'I seek Lord Hollingford as I should seek such a man, whatever his rank
or position might be: usher to a school, carpenter, shoemaker, if it were
possible for them to have had a similar character of mind developed by
similar advantages. Mr Goodenough is a very clever attorney, with strong
local interests and not a thought beyond.'</DD>

<DD>
'Well, well, don't go on arguing, it always gives me a headache, as Phoebe
knows. I didn't mean what I said, that's enough, isn't it? I'll retract
anything sooner than be reasoned with. Where were we before you began your
arguments?'</DD>

<DD>
'About dear little Molly coming to pay us a visit,' said Miss Phoebe.</DD>

<DD>
'I should have asked you at first, only Coxe was so rampant with his love.
I didn't know what he might do, or how troublesome he might be both to
Molly and you. But he has cooled down now. Absence has had a very tranquillizing
effect, and I think Molly may be in the same town with him, without any
consequences beyond a few sighs every time she's brought to his mind by
meeting her. And I've got another favour to ask of you, so you see it would
never do for me to argue with you, Miss Browning, when I ought to be a
humble suppliant. Something must be done to the house to make it all ready
for the future Mrs Gibson. It wants painting and papering shamefully, and
I should think some new furniture, but I'm sure I don't know what. Would
you be so very kind as to look over the place, and see how far a hundred
pounds will go? The dining-room walls must be painted; we'll keep the drawing-room
paper for her choice, and I've a little spare money for that room for her
to lay out; but all the rest of the house I'll leave to you, if you'll
only be kind enough to help an old friend.'</DD>

<DD>
This was a commission which exactly gratified Miss Browning's love of power.
The disposal of money involved patronage of tradespeople, such as she had
exercised in her father's lifetime, but had had very little chance of showing
since his death. Her usual good-humour was quite restored by this proof
of confidence in her taste and economy, while Miss Phoebe's imagination
dwelt rather on the pleasure of a visit from Molly.</DD>
