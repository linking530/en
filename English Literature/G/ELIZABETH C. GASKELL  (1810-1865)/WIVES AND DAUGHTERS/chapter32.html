<DD>
Roger had turned over many plans in his mind, by which he thought that
he could obtain sufficient money for the purpose he desired to accomplish.
His careful grandfather, who had been a merchant in the city, had so tied
up the few thousands he had left to his daughter, that although, in case
of her death before her husband's, the latter might enjoy the life interest
thereof, yet in case of both their deaths, their second son did not succeed
to the property until he was five-and-twenty. and if he died before that
age the money that would then have been his went to one of his cousins
on the maternal side. In short, the old merchant had taken as many precautions
about his legacy as if it had been for tens, instead of units of thousands.
Of course Roger might have slipped through all these meshes by insuring
his life until the specified age; and probably if he had consulted any
lawyer this course would have been suggested to him. But he disliked taking
any one into his confidence on the subject of his father's want of ready
money. He had obtained a copy of his grandfather's will at Doctors' Commons,
and he imagined that all the contingencies involved in it would be patent
to the light of nature and common sense. He was a little mistaken in this,
but not the less resolved that money in some way he would have in order
to fulfil his promise to his father, and for the ulterior purpose of giving
the squire some daily interest to distract his thoughts from the regrets
and cares that were almost weakening his mind. It was 'Roger Hamley, Senior
Wrangler and Fellow of Trinity, to the highest bidder, no matter what honest
employment,' and presently it came down to 'any bidder at all.'</DD>

<DD>
Another perplexity and distress at this time weighed upon Roger. Osborne,
heir to the estate, was going to have a child. The Hamley property was
entailed on 'heirs male born in lawful wedlock.' Was the 'wedlock' lawful?
Osborne never seemed to doubt that it was - never seemed, in fact, to think
twice about it. And if he, the husband, did not, how much less did Aim&eacute;e,
the trustful wife? Yet who could tell how much misery any shadows of illegality
might cast into the future? One evening Roger, sitting by the languid,
careless, dilettante Osborne, began to question him as to the details of
the marriage. Osborne knew instinctively at what Roger was aiming. It was
not that he did not desire perfect legality in justice to his wife; it
was that he was so indisposed at the time that he hated to be bothered.
It was something like the refrain of Gray's Scandinavian Prophetess: 'Leave
me, leave me to repose.'</DD>

<DD>
'But do try and tell me how you managed it.'</DD>

<DD>
'How tiresome you are, Roger,' put in Osborne.</DD>

<DD>
'Well, I dare say I am. Go on!'</DD>

<DD>
'I've told you Morrison married us. You remember old Morrison at Trinity?'</DD>

<DD>
'Yes; as good and blunder-headed a fellow as ever lived.'</DD>

<DD>
'Well, he's taken orders; and the examination for priest's orders fatigued
him so much that he got his father to give him a hundred or two for a tour
on the Continent. He meant to get to Rome, because he heard that there
were such pleasant winters there. So he turned up at Metz in August.'</DD>

<DD>
'I don't see why.'</DD>

<DD>
'No more did he. He never was great in geography, you know; and somehow
he thought that Metz, pronounced French fashion, must be on the road to
Rome. Some one had told him so in fun. However, it was very well for me
that I met with him there for I was determined to be married, and that
without loss of time.'</DD>

<DD>
'But Aim&eacute;e is a Catholic?'</DD>

<DD>
'That's true! but you see I am not. You don't suppose I would do her any
wrong, Roger?' asked Osborne, sitting up in his lounging-chair, and speaking
rather indignantly to Roger, his face suddenly flushing red.</DD>

<DD>
'No! I'm sure you would not mean it; but you see there's a child coming,
and this estate is entailed on "heirs male." Now, I want to know if the
marriage is legal or not? and it seems to me it's a ticklish question.'</DD>

<DD>
'Oh!' said Osborne, falling back into repose, 'if that's all, I suppose
you're next heir male, and I can trust you as I can myself. You know my
marriage is <I>bon&acirc; fide</I> in intention, and I believe it to be
legal in fact. We went over to Strasbourg; Aim&eacute;e picked up a friend
- a good middle-aged Frenchwoman - who served half as bridesmaid, half
as chaperone, and then we went before the mayor - <I>pr&eacute;fet</I>
- what do you call them? I think Morrison rather enjoyed the spree. I signed
all manner of papers in the prefecture; I did not read them over, for fear
lest I could not sign them conscientiously. It was the safest plan. Aim&eacute;e
kept trembling so I thought she would faint, and then we went off to the
nearest English chaplaincy, Carlsruhe, and the chaplain was away, so Morrison
easily got the loan of the chapel, and we were married the next day.'</DD>

<DD>
'But surely some registration or certificate was necessary?'</DD>

<DD>
'Morrison said he would undertake all those forms; and he ought to know
his own business.' I know I tipped him pretty well for the job.'</DD>

<DD>
'You must be married again,' said Roger, after a pause, 'and that before
the child is born. Have you got a certificate of the marriage?'</DD>

<DD>
'I dare say Morrison has got it somewhere. But I believe I'm legally married
according to the laws both of England and France; I really do, old fellow.
I've got the <I>pr&eacute;fet</I>'s papers somewhere.'</DD>

<DD>
'Never mind! you shall be married again in England. Aim&eacute;e goes to
the Roman Catholic chapel at Prestham, does not she?'</DD>

<DD>
'Yes. She is so good I would not disturb her in her religion for the world.'</DD>

<DD>
'Then you shall be married both there and at the church of the parish in
which she lives as well,' said Roger, decidedly.</DD>

<DD>
'It's a great deal of trouble, unnecessary trouble, and unnecessary expense,
I should say,' said Osborne. 'Why can't you leave well alone? Neither Aim&eacute;e
nor I are of the sort of stuff to turn scoundrels and deny the legality
of our marriage, and if the child is a boy and my father dies, and I die,
why I'm. sure you'll do him justice, as sure as I am of myself, old fellow!'</DD>

<DD>
'But if I die into the bargain? Make a hecatomb of the present Hamleys
all at once, while you are about it. Who succeeds as heir male?'</DD>

<DD>
Osborne thought for a moment. 'One of the Irish Hamleys, I suppose. I fancy
they are needy chaps. Perhaps you're right. But what need to have such
gloomy forebodings?'</DD>

<DD>
'The law makes one have foresight in such affairs,' said Roger. 'So I'll
go down to Aim&eacute;e next week when I'm in town, and I'll make all necessary
arrangements before you come. I think you'll be happier if it is all done.'</DD>

<DD>
'I shall be happier if I've a chance of seeing the little woman, that I
grant you. But what is taking you up to town? I wish I'd money to run about
like you, instead of being shut up for ever in this dull old house.'</DD>

<DD>
Osborne was apt occasionally to contrast his position with Roger's in a
tone of complaint, forgetting that both were the results of character,
and also that out of his income Roger gave up so large a portion for the
maintenance of his brother's wife. But if this ungenerous thought of Osborne's
had been set clearly before his conscience, he would have smote his breast
and cried '<I>Mea culpa</I>' with the best of them; it was only that he
was too indolent to keep an unassisted conscience.</DD>

<DD>
'I should not have thought of going up,' said Roger, reddening as if he
had been accused of spending another's money instead of his own, 'if I
had not had to go up on business. Lord Hollingford has written for me;
he knows my great wish for employment, and has heard of something which
he considers suitable; there's his letter if you care to read it. But it
does not tell anything definitely.'</DD>

<DD>
Osborne read the letter and returned it to Roger. After a moment or two
of silence he said, - 'Why do you want money? Are we taking too much from
you? It's a great shame of me; but what can I do? Only suggest a career
for me, and I'll follow it to-morrow.' He spoke as if Roger had been reproaching
him.</DD>

<DD>
'My dear fellow, don't get those notions into your head! I must do something
for myself sometimes, and I have been on the look-out. Besides, I want
my father to go on with his drainage, it would do good both to his health
and his spirits. If I can advance any part of the money requisite, he and
you shall pay me interest until you can return the capital.'</DD>

<DD>
'Roger, you're the providence of the family,' exclaimed Osborne, suddenly
struck by admiration at his brother's conduct, and forgetting to contrast
it with his own.</DD>

<DD>
So Roger went up to London and Osborne followed him, and for two or three
weeks the Gibsons saw nothing of the brothers. But as wave succeeds to
wave, so interest succeeds to interest. 'The family,' as they were called,
came down for their autumn sojourn at the Towers; and again the house was
full of visitors, and the Towers' servants, and carriages, and liveries
were seen in the two streets of Hollingford, just as they might have been
seen for scores of autumns past.</DD>

<DD>
So runs the round of life from day to day. Mrs Gibson found the chances
of intercourse with the Towers rather more personally exciting than Roger's
visits, or the rarer calls of Osborne Hamley. Cynthia had an old antipathy
to the great family who had made so much of her mother and so little of
her; and whom she considered as in some measure the cause why she had seen
so little of her mother in the days when the little girl had craved for
love and found none. Moreover, Cynthia missed her slave, although she did
not care for Roger one thousandth part of what he did for her; yet she
had found it not unpleasant to have a man whom she thoroughly respected,
and whom men in general respected, the subject of her eye, the glad ministrant
to each scarce spoken wish, a person in whose sight all her words were
pearls or diamonds, all her actions heavenly graciousness, and in whose
thoughts she reigned supreme. She had no modest unconsciousness about her;
and yet she was not vain. She knew of all this worship; and when from circumstances
she no longer received it she missed it. The Earl and the Countess, Lord
Hollingford and Lady Harriet, lords and ladies in general, liveries, dresses,
bags of game, and rumours of riding parties were as nothing to her as compared
to Roger's absence. And yet she did not love him. No, she did not love
him. Molly knew that Cynthia did not love him. Molly grew angry with her
many and many a time as the conviction of this fact was forced upon her.
Molly did not know her own feelings; Roger had no overwhelming interest
in what they might be; while his very life-breath seemed to depend on what
Cynthia felt and thought. Therefore Molly had keen insight into her 'sister's'
heart; and she knew that Cynthia did not love Roger, Molly could have cried
with passionate regret at the thought of the unvalued treasure lying at
Cynthia's feet; and it would have been a merely unselfish regret. It was
the old fervid tenderness. 'Do not wish for the moon, O my darling, for
I cannot give it thee.' Cynthia's love was the moon Roger yearned for;
and Molly saw that it was far away and out of reach, else would she have
strained her heart-chords to give it to Roger.</DD>

<DD>
'I am his sister,' she would say to herself. 'That old bond is not done
away with, though he is too much absorbed by Cynthia to speak about it
just now. His mother called me "Fanny;" it was almost like an adoption.
I must wait and watch, and see if I can do anything for my brother.'</DD>

<DD>
One day Lady Harriet came to call on the Gibsons, or rather on Mrs Gibson,
for the latter retained her old jealousy if any one else in Hollingford
was supposed to be on intimate terms at the great house, or in the least
acquainted with their plans. Mr Gibson might possibly know as much, but
then he was professionally bound to secrecy. Out of the house she considered
Mr Preston as her rival, and he was aware that she did so, and delighted
in teasing her by affecting a knowledge of family plans and details of
affairs of which she was not aware. Indoors she was jealous of the fancy
Lady Harriet had evidently taken for her stepdaughter, and she contrived
to place quiet obstacles in the way of a too frequent intercourse between
the two. These obstacles were not unlike the shield of the knight in the
old story; only instead of the two sides presented to the two travellers
approaching it from opposite quarters, one of which was silver, and one
of which was gold, Lady Harriet saw the smooth and shining yellow radiance,
while poor Molly only perceived a dull and heavy lead. To Lady Harriet
it was 'Molly is gone out; she will be so sorry to miss you, but she was
obliged to go to see some old friends of her mother's whom she ought not
to neglect: as I said to her, constancy is everything. It is Sterne, I
think, who says, "Thine own and thy mother's friends forsake not." But,
dear Lady Harriet, you'll stop till she comes home, won't you? I know how
fond you are of her. in fact' (with a little surface playfulness) 'I sometimes
say you come more to see her than your poor old Clare.'</DD>

<DD>
To Molly it had previously been, -</DD>

<DD>
'Lady Harriet is coming here this morning. I can't have any one else coming
in. Tell Maria to say I'm not at home. Lady Harriet has always so much
to tell me. Dear Lady Harriet! I've known all her secrets since she was
twelve years old. You two girls must keep out of the way. Of course she'll
ask for you, out of common civility; but you would only interrupt us if
you came in, as you did the other day;' - now addressing Molly - 'l hardly
like to say so, but I thought it was very forward.'</DD>

<DD>
'Maria told me she had asked for me,' put in Molly, simply.</DD>

<DD>
'Very forward indeed!' continued Mrs Gibson, taking no further notice of
the interruption, except to strengthen the words to which Molly's little
speech had been intended as a correction.</DD>

<DD>
'I think this time I must secure her ladyship from the chances of such
an intrusion, by taking care that you are out of the house, Molly. You
had better go to the Holly Farm, and speak about those damsons I ordered,
and which have never been sent.'</DD>

<DD>
'I'll go,' said Cynthia. 'It's far too long a walk for Molly; she's had
a bad cold, and is not as strong as she was a fortnight ago. I delight
in long walks. If you want Molly out of the way, mamma, send her to the
Miss Brownings' - they are always glad to see her.'</DD>

<DD>
'I never said I wanted Molly out of the way, Cynthia,' replied Mrs Gibson.
'You always put things in such an exaggerated - I should almost say, so
coarse a manner. I am sure, Molly, my love, you could never have so misunderstood
me; it is only on Lady Harriet's account.'</DD>

<DD>
'I don't think I can walk as far as the Holly Farm; papa would take the
message; Cynthia need not go.'</DD>

<DD>
'Well! I'm the last person in the world to tax any one's strength; I'd
sooner never see damson preserve again. Suppose you do go and see Miss
Browning; you can pay her a nice long call - you know she likes that -
and ask after Miss Phoebe's cold from me, you know. They were friends of
your mother's, my dear, and I would not have you break off old friendships
for the world. "Constancy above everything" is my motto, as you know, and
the memory of the dead ought always to be cherished.'</DD>

<DD>
'Now, mamma, where am I to go?' asked Cynthia. 'Though Lady Harriet does
not care for me as much as she does for Molly - indeed, quite the contrary
I should say - yet she might ask after me, and I had better be safely out
of the way.'</DD>

<DD>
'True!' said Mrs Gibson, meditatively, yet unconscious of any satire in
Cynthia's speech. - 'She is much less likely to ask for you, my dear: I
almost think you might remain in the house, or you might go to the Holly
Farm; I really do want the damsons; or you might stay here in the dining-room,
you know, so as to be ready to arrange lunch prettily, if she does take
a fancy to stay for it. She is very fanciful, is dear Lady Harriet! I would
not like her to think we made any difference in our meals because she stayed.
"Simple elegance," as I tell her, "always is what we aim at." But still
you could put out the best service, and arrange some flowers, and ask cook
what there is for dinner that she could send us for lunch, and make it
all look pretty, and impromptu, and natural. I think you had better stay
at home, Cynthia, and then you could fetch Molly from Miss Brownings' in
the afternoon, you know, and you two could take a walk together.'</DD>

<DD>
'After Lady Harriet was fairly gone! I understand, mamma. Off with you,
Molly. Make haste, or Lady Harriet may come and ask for you as well as
mamma. I'll take care and forget where you are going to, so that no one
shall learn from me where you are, and I'll answer for mamma's loss of
memory.'</DD>

<DD>
'Child! what nonsense you talk; you quite confuse me with being so silly,'
said Mrs Gibson, fluttered and annoyed as she usually was with the Lilliputian
darts' Cynthia flung at her. She had recourse to her accustomed feckless
piece of retaliation - bestowing some favour on Molly; and this did not
hurt Cynthia one whit.</DD>

<DD>
'Molly, darling, there's a very cold wind, though it looks so fine. You
had better put on my Indian shawl; and it will look so pretty, too, on
your grey gown - scarlet and grey - it's not everybody I would lend it
to, but you're so careful.'</DD>

<DD>
'Thank you,' said Molly: and she left Mrs Gibson in careless uncertainty
as to whether her otter would be accepted or not.</DD>

<DD>
Lady Harriet was sorry to miss Molly, as she was fond of the girl; but
as she perfectly agreed with Mrs Gibson's truisms about 'constancy' and
'old friends,' she saw no occasion for saying any more about the affair,
but sate down in a little low chair with her feet on the fender. This said
fender was made of bright, bright steel, and was strictly tabooed to all
household and plebeian feet; indeed the position, if they assumed it, was
considered low-bred and vulgar.</DD>

<DD>
'That's right, dear Lady Harriet! you can't think what a pleasure it is
to me to welcome you at my own fireside, into my humble home.'</DD>

<DD>
'Humble! now, Clare, that's a little bit of nonsense, begging your pardon.
I don't call this pretty little drawing-room a bit of a "humble home."
It is as full of comforts, and of pretty things too, as any room of its
size can be.'</DD>

<DD>
'Ah! how small you must feel it! even I had to reconcile myself to it at
first.'</DD>

<DD>
'Well! perhaps your school-room was larger, but remember how bare it was,
how empty of anything but deal tables, and forms, and mats. Oh, indeed,
Clare, I quite agree with mamma, who always says you have done very well
for yourself; and Mr Gibson too! What an agreeable, well-informed man!'</DD>

<DD>
'Yes, he is,' said his wife, slowly, as if she did not like to relinquish
her <I>r&ocirc;le</I> of a victim to circumstances quite immediately. 'He
is very agreeable, very; only we see so little of him; and of course he
comes home tired and hungry, and not inclined to talk to his own family,
and apt to go to sleep.'</DD>

<DD>
'Come, come!' said Lady Harriet, 'I'm going to have my turn now. We've
had the complaint of a doctor's wife, now hear the moans of a peer's daughter.
Our house is so overrun with visitors; and literally to-day I have come
to you for a little solitude.'</DD>

<DD>
'Solitude!' exclaimed Mrs Gibson. 'Would you rather be alone?' slightly
aggrieved.</DD>

<DD>
'No, you dear silly woman; my solitude requires a listener, to whom I may
say, "How sweet is solitude." But I am tired of the responsibility of entertaining.
Papa is so open-hearted, he asks every friend he meets with to come and
pay us a visit. Mamma is really a great invalid, but she does not choose
to give up her reputation for good health, having always considered illness
a want of self-control. So she gets wearied and worried by a crowd of people
who are all of them open-mouthed for amusement of some kind; just like
a brood of fledglings in a nest; so I have to be parent-bird, and pop morsels
into their yellow leathery bills, to find them swallowed down before I
can think of where to find the next. Oh, it's "entertaining" in the largest,
literalest, dreariest sense of the word. So I have told a few lies this
morning, and come off here for quietness and the comfort of complaining!'</DD>

<DD>
Lady Harriet threw herself back in her chair, and yawned; Mrs Gibson took
one of her ladyship's hands in a soft sympathizing manner, and murmured,
'Poor Lady Harriet!' and then she purred affectionately.</DD>

<DD>
After a pause Lady Harriet started up and said, - 'I used to take you as
my arbiter of morals when I was a little girl. Tell me, do you think it
wrong to tell lies?'</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, my dear! how can you ask such questions? - of course it is very wrong,
- very wicked indeed, I think I may say. But I know you were only joking
when you said you had told lies.'</DD>

<DD>
'No, indeed, I was not. I told as plump fat lies as you would wish to hear.
I said I "was obliged to go into Hollingford on business," when the truth
was there was no obligation in the matter, only an insupportable desire
of being free from my visitors for an hour or two, and my only business
was to come here, and yawn, and complain, and lounge at my leisure. I really
think I'm unhappy at having told a story, as children express it.'</DD>

<DD>
'But, my dear Lady Harriet,' said Mrs Gibson, a little puzzled as to the
exact meaning of the words that were trembling on her tongue, 'I am sure
you thought that you meant what you said, when you said it.'</DD>

<DD>
'No, I didn't,' put in Lady Harriet.</DD>

<DD>
'And besides, if you didn't, it was the fault of the tiresome people who
drove you into such straits - yes, it was certainly their fault, not yours
- and then you know the conventions of society - ah, what trammels they
are!'</DD>

<DD>
Lady Harriet was silent for a minute or two; then she said, - 'Tell me,
Clare; you've told lies sometimes, haven't you?'</DD>

<DD>
'Lady Harriet! r think you might have known me better; but I know you don't
mean it, dear.'</DD>

<DD>
'Yes, I do. You must have told white lies, at any rate. How did you feel
after them?'</DD>

<DD>
'I should have been miserable if I ever had. I should have died of self-reproach.
"The truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth," has always seemed
to me such a fine passage. But then I have so much that is unbending in
my nature, and in our sphere of life there are so few temptations. If we
are humble, we are also simple, and unshackled by etiquette.'</DD>

<DD>
'Then you blame me very much? If somebody else will blame me, I shan't
be so unhappy at what I said this morning.'</DD>

<DD>
'I am sure I never blamed you, not in my innermost heart, dear Lady Harriet.
Blame you, indeed! That would be presumption in me.'</DD>

<DD>
'I think I shall set up a confessor! and it shan't be you, Clare, for you
have always been only too indulgent to me.'</DD>

<DD>
After a pause she said, - 'Can you give me some lunch, Clare? I don't mean
to go home till three. My "business" will take me till then, as the people
at the Towers are duly informed.'</DD>

<DD>
'Certainly. I shall be delighted! but you know we are very simple in our
habits.'</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, I only want a little bread and butter, and perhaps a slice of cold
meat - you must not give yourself any trouble, Clare - perhaps you dine
now? let me sit down just like one of your family.'</DD>

<DD>
'Yes, you shall; I won't make any alteration; - it will be so pleasant
to have you sharing our family meal, dear Lady Harriet. But we dine late,
we only lunch now. How low the fire is getting; I really am forgetting
everything in the pleasure of this t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te!'</DD>

<DD>
So she rang twice; with great distinctness, and with a long pause between
the rings. Maria brought in coals.</DD>

<DD>
But the signal was as well understood by Cynthia as the 'Hall of Apollo'
was by the servants of Lucullus. The brace of partridges that were to have
been for the late dinner were instantly put down to the fire; and the prettiest
china put out, and the table decked with flowers and fruit, arranged with
all Cynthia's usual dexterity and taste. So that when the meal was announced,
and Lady Harriet entered the room, she could not but think her hostess's
apologies had been quite unnecessary; and be more and more convinced that
Clare had done very well for herself. Cynthia now joined the party, pretty
and elegant as she always was; but somehow she did not take Lady Harriet's
fancy; she only noticed her on account of her being her mother's daughter.
Her presence made the conversation more general, and Lady Harriet gave
out several pieces of news, none of them of any great importance to her,
but as what had been talked about by the circle of visitors assembled at
the Towers.</DD>

<DD>
'Lord Hollingford ought to have been with us,' she said, amongst other
things; 'but he is obliged, or fancies himself obliged, which is all the
same thing, to stay in town about this Crichton legacy!'</DD>

<DD>
'A legacy? To Lord Hollingford? I am so glad!'</DD>

<DD>
'Don't be in a hurry to be glad! It's nothing for him but trouble. Did
not you hear of that rich eccentric Mr Crichton, who died some time ago,
and - fired by the example of Lord Bridgewater, I suppose - left a sum
of money in the hands of trustees, of whom my brother is one, to send out
a man with a thousand fine qualifications, to make a scientific voyage,
with a view to bringing back specimens of the fauna of distant lands, and
so forming the nucleus of a museum which is to be called the Crichton Museum,
and so perpetuate the founder's name. Such various forms does man's vanity
take! Sometimes it stimulates philanthropy; sometimes a love of science!'</DD>

<DD>
'It seems to me a very laudable and useful object, I am sure,' said Mrs
Gibson, safely.</DD>

<DD>
'I daresay it is, taking it from the public-good view. But it is rather
tiresome to us privately, for it keeps Hollingford in town - or between
it and Cambridge - and each place as dull and empty as can be, just when
we want him down at the Towers. The thing ought to have been decided long
ago, and there's some danger of the legacy lapsing. The two other trustees
have run away to the Continent, feeling, as they say, the utmost confidence
in him, but in reality shirking their responsibilities. However, I believe
he likes it, so I ought not to grumble. He thinks he is going to be very
successful in the choice of his man - and he belongs to this county, too,
- young Hamley of Hamley, if he can only get his college to let him go,
for he's a Fellow of Trinity, Senior Wrangler or something; and they're
not so foolish as to send their crack man to be eaten up by lions and tigers!'</DD>

<DD>
'It must be Roger Hamley!' exclaimed Cynthia, her eyes brightening, and
her cheeks flushing.</DD>

<DD>
'He's not the eldest son; he can scarcely be called Hamley of Hamley!'
said Mrs Gibson.</DD>

<DD>
'Hollingford's man is a Fellow of Trinity, as I said before.'</DD>

<DD>
'Then it is Mr Roger Hamley,' said Cynthia; 'and he's up in London about
some business! What news for Molly when she comes home!'</DD>

<DD>
'Why, what has Molly to do with it?' asked Lady Harriet. 'Is -- ?' and
she looked into Mrs Gibson's face for an answer. Mrs Gibson in reply gave
an intelligent and very expressive glance at Cynthia, who however did not
perceive it.</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, no! not at all' - and Mrs Gibson nodded a little at her daughter,
as much as to say, 'If any one, that.'</DD>

<DD>
Lady Harriet began to look at the pretty Miss Kirkpatrick with fresh interest;
her brother had spoken in such a manner of this young Mr Hamley that every
one connected with the Phoenix was worthy of observation. Then, as if the
mention of Molly's name had brought her afresh into her mind, Lady Harriet
said, - 'And where is Molly all this time? I should like to see my little
mentor. I hear she is very much grown since those days.'</DD>

<DD>
'Oh! when she once gets gossipping with the Miss Brownings, she never knows
when to come home,' said Mrs Gibson.</DD>

<DD>
'The Miss Brownings? Oh! I am so glad you named them! I am very fond of
them. Pecksy and Flapsy; I may call them so in Molly's absence. I'll go
and see them before I go home, and then perhaps I shall see my dear little
Molly too. Do you know, Clare, I have quite taken a fancy to that girl!'</DD>

<DD>
So Mrs Gibson, after all her precautions, had to submit to Lady Harriet's
leaving her half-an-hour earlier than she otherwise would have done in
order to 'make herself common' (as Mrs Gibson expressed it) by calling
on the Miss Brownings.</DD>

<DD>
But Molly had left before Lady Harriet arrived.</DD>

<DD>
Molly went the long walk to the Holly Farm to order the damsons out of
a kind of penitence. She had felt conscious of anger at being sent out
of the house by such a palpable manoeuvre as that which her stepmother
had employed. Of course she did not meet Cynthia, so she went alone along
the pretty lanes, with grassy sides and high hedge-banks not at all in
the style of modern agriculture. At first she made herself uncomfortable
with questioning herself as to how far it was right to leave unnoticed
the small domestic failings - the webs, the distortions of truth which
had prevailed in their household ever since her father's second marriage.
She knew that very often she longed to protest, but did not do it, from
the desire of sparing her father any discord; and she saw by his face that
he, too, was occasionally aware of certain things that gave him pain, as
showing that his wife's standard of conduct was not as high as he would
have liked. It was a wonder to Molly if this silence was right or wrong.
With a girl's want of toleration, and want of experience to teach her the
force of circumstances, and of temptation, she had often been on the point
of telling her stepmother some forcible home truths. But possibly her father's
example of silence, and often some piece of kindness on Mrs Gibson's part
(for after her way, and when in a good temper, she was very kind to Molly),
made her hold her tongue.</DD>

<DD>
That night at dinner Mrs Gibson recounted the conversation between herself
and Lady Harriet, giving it a very strong individual colouring, as was
her wont, and telling nearly the whole of what had passed, although implying
that there was a great deal said that was so purely confidential, that
she was bound in honour not to repeat it. Her three auditors listened to
her without interrupting her much - indeed, without bestowing extreme attention
on what she was saying, until she came to the fact of Lord Hollingford's
absence in London, and the reason for it.</DD>

<DD>
'Roger Hamley going off on a scientific expedition!' exclaimed Mr Gibson,
suddenly awakened into vivacity.</DD>

<DD>
'Yes. At least it is not settled finally; but as Lord Hollingford is the
only trustee who takes any interest - and being Lord Cumnor's son - it
is next to certain.'</DD>

<DD>
'I think I must have a voice in the matter,' said Mr Gibson; and he relapsed
into silence, keeping his ears open, however, henceforward.</DD>

<DD>
'How long will he be away?' asked Cynthia. 'We shall miss him sadly.'</DD>

<DD>
Molly's lips formed an acquiescing 'yes' to this remark, but no sound was
heard. There was a buzzing in her ears as if the others were going on with
the conversation, but the words they uttered seemed indistinct and blurred;
they were merely conjectures, and did not interfere with the one great
piece of news. To the rest of the party she appeared to be eating her dinner
as usual, and, if she were silent, there was one listener the more to Mrs
Gibson's stream of prattle, and Mr Gibson's and Cynthia's remarks.</DD>
