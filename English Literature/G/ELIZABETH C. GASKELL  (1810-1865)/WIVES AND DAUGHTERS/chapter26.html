<DD>
At the present time there are few people at a public ball besides the dancers
and their chaperones, or relations in some degree interested in them. But
in the days when Molly and Cynthia were young - before railroads were,
and before their consequences, the excursion-trains, which take every one
up to London now-a-days, there to see their fill of gay crowds and fine
dresses - to go to an annual charity-ball, even though all thought of dancing
had passed by years ago, and without any of the responsibilities of a chaperone,
was a very allowable and favourite piece of dissipation to all the kindly
old maids who thronged the country towns of England. They aired their old
lace and their best dresses; they saw the aristocratic magnates of the
country side; they gossipped with their coevals, and speculated on the
romances of the young around them in a curious yet friendly spirit. The
Miss Brownings would have thought themselves sadly defrauded of the gayest
event of the year, if anything had prevented their attending the charity-ball,
and Miss Browning would have been indignant, Miss Phoebe aggrieved, had
they not been asked to Ashcombe and Coreham, by friends at each place,
who had, like them, gone through the dancing stage of life some five-and-twenty
years before, but who liked still to haunt the scenes of their former enjoyment,
and see a younger generation dance on 'regardless of their doom.' They
had come in one of the two sedan-chairs that yet lingered in use at Hollingford;
such a night as this brought a regular harvest of gains to the two old
men who, in what was called the 'town's livery,' trotted backwards and
forwards with their many loads of ladies and finery. There were some postchaises,
and some 'flys,' but after mature deliberation Miss Browning had decided
to keep to the more comfortable custom of the sedan-chair; 'which,' as
she said to Miss Piper, one of her visitors, 'came into the parlour, and
got full of the warm air, and nipped you up, and carried you tight and
cosy into another warm room, where you could walk out without having to
show your legs by going up steps, or down steps.' Of course only one could
go at a time; but here again a little of Miss Browning's good management
arranged everything so very nicely, as Miss Hornblower (their other visitor)
remarked. She went first, and remained in the warm cloak-room until her
hostess followed; and then the two ladies went arm-in-arm into the ball-room,
finding out convenient seats whence they could watch the arrivals and speak
to their passing friends, until Miss Phoebe and Miss Piper entered, and
came to take possession of the seats reserved for them by Miss Browning's
care. These two younger ladies came in, also arm-in-arm, but with a certain
timid flurry in look and movement very different from the composed dignity
of their seniors (by two or three years). When all four were once more
assembled together, they took breath, and began to converse.</DD>

<DD>
'Upon my word, I really do think this is a better room than our Ashcombe
Court-house!'</DD>

<DD>
'And how prettily it is decorated!' piped out Miss Piper. 'How well the
roses are made! But you all have such taste at Hollingford.'</DD>

<DD>
'There's Mrs Dempster,' cried Miss Hornblower; 'she said she and her two
daughters<!--wive--> were asked to stay at Mr Sheepshanks'. Mr Preston
was to be there, too; but I suppose they could not all come at once. Look!
and there is young Roscoe, our new doctor. I declare it seems as if all
Ashcombe were here. Mr Roscoe! Mr Roscoe! come here and let me introduce
you to the Miss Brownings, the friends we are staying with. We think very
highly of our young doctor, I can assure you, Miss Browning.'</DD>

<DD>
Mr Roscoe bowed, and simpered at hearing his own praises. But Miss Browning
had no notion of having any doctor praised, who had come to settle even
on the very verge of Mr Gibson's practice, so she said to Miss Hornblower,
-</DD>

<DD>
'You must be glad, I am sure, to have somebody you can call in, if you
are in any sudden hurry, or for things that are too trifling to trouble
Mr Gibson about; and I should think Mr Roscoe would feel it a great advantage
to profit, as he will naturally have the opportunity of doing, by witnessing
Mr Gibson's skill!'</DD>

<DD>
Probably Mr Roscoe would have felt more aggrieved by this speech than he
really was, if his attention had not been called off just then by the entrance
of the very Mr Gibson who was being spoken of. Almost before Miss Browning
had ended her severe and depreciatory remarks, he had asked his friend
Miss Hornblower, -</DD>

<DD>
'Who is that lovely girl in pink, just come in?'</DD>

<DD>
'Why, that's Cynthia Kirkpatrick!' said Miss Hornblower, taking up a ponderous
gold eyeglass to make sure of her fact. 'How she has grown! To be sure
it is two or three years since she left Ashcombe - she was very pretty
then - people did say Mr Preston admired her very much; but she was so
young!'</DD>

<DD>
'Can you introduce me?' asked the impatient young surgeon. 'I should like
to ask her to dance.' When Miss Hornblower returned from her greeting to
her former acquaintance, Mrs Gibson, and had accomplished the introduction
which Mr Roscoe had requested, she began her little confidences to Miss
Browning.</DD>

<DD>
'Well, to be sure! How condescending we are! I remember the time when Mrs
Kirkpatrick wore old black silks, and was thankful and civil as became
her place as a schoolmistress, and as having to earn her bread. And now
she is in a satin; and she speaks to me as if she just could recollect
who I was, if she tried very hard! It isn't so long ago since Mrs Dempster
came to consult me as to whether Mrs Kirkpatrick would be offended, if
she sent her a new breadth for her lilac silk-gown, in place of one that
had been spoilt by Mrs Dempster's servant spilling the coffee over it the
night before; and she took it and was thankful, for all she's dressed in
pearl-grey satin now! And she would have been glad enough to marry Mr Preston
in those days.'</DD>

<DD>
'I thought you said he admired her daughter,' put in Miss Browning to her
irritated friend.</DD>

<DD>
'Well! perhaps I did, and perhaps it was so; I am sure I can't tell; he
was a great deal at the house. Miss Dixon keeps a school in the same house
now, and I am sure she does it a great deal better.'</DD>

<DD>
'The earl and the countess are very fond of Mrs Gibson,' said Miss Browning.
'I know, for Lady Harriet told us when she came to drink tea with us last
autumn; and they desired Mr Preston to be very attentive to her when she
lived at Ashcombe.'</DD>

<DD>
'For goodness' sake don't go and repeat what I've been saying about Mr
Preston and Mrs Kirkpatrick to her ladyship. One may be mistaken, and you
know I only said "people talked about it."'</DD>

<DD>
Miss Hornblower was evidently alarmed lest her gossip should be repeated
to the Lady Harriet, who appeared to be on such an intimate footing with
her Hollingford friends. Nor did Miss Browning dissipate the illusion.
Lady Harriet had drunk tea with them, and might do it again; and, at any
rate, the little fright she had put her friend into was not a bad return
for that praise of Mr Roscoe, which had offended Miss Browning's loyalty
to Mr Gibson.</DD>

<DD>
Meanwhile Miss Piper and Miss Phoebe, who had not the character of <I>esprit-forts</I>
to maintain, talked of the dresses of the people present, beginning by
complimenting each other.</DD>

<DD>
'What a lovely turban you have got on, Miss Piper, if I may be allowed
to say so: so becoming to your complexion!'</DD>

<DD>
'Do you think so?' said Miss Piper, with ill-concealed gratification; it
was something to have a 'complexion' at forty-five. 'I got it at Brown's,
at Somerton, for this very ball. I thought I must have something to set
off my gown, which isn't quite so new as it once was; and I have no handsome
jewellery like you' - looking with admiring eyes at a large miniature set
round with pearls, which served as a shield to Miss Phoebe's breast.</DD>

<DD>
'It is handsome,' that lady replied. 'It is a likeness of my dear mother;
Sally has got my father on. The miniatures were both taken at the same
time; and just about then my uncle died and left us each a legacy of fifty
pounds, which we agreed to spend on the setting of our miniatures. But
because they are so valuable Sally always keeps them locked up with the
best silver, and hides the box somewhere; she never will tell me where,
because she says I've such weak nerves, and that if a burglar, with a loaded
pistol at my head, were to ask me where we kept our plate and jewels, I
should be sure to tell him; and she says, for her part, she would never
think of revealing under any circumstances. (I'm sure I hope she won't
be tried.) But that's the reason I don't wear it often; it's only the second
time I've had it on; and I can't even get at it, and look at it, which
I should like to do. I shouldn't have had it on to-night, but that Sally
gave it out to me, saying it was but a proper compliment to pay to the
Duchess of Menteith, who is to be here in all her diamonds.'</DD>

<DD>
'Dear-ah-me! Is she really! Do you know I never saw a duchess before.'
And Miss Piper drew herself up and craned her neck, as if resolved to 'behave
herself properly,' as she had been taught to do at boarding-school thirty
years before, in the presence of 'her grace.' By-and-by she said to Miss
Phoebe, with a sudden jerk out of position, - 'Look, look! that's our Mr
Cholmley, the magistrate' (he was the great man of Coreham), 'and that's
Mrs Cholmley in red satin, and Mr George and Mr Harry from Oxford, I do
declare; and Miss Cholmley, and pretty Miss Sophy. I should like to go
and speak to them, but then it's so formidable crossing. a room without
a gentleman. And there is Coxe the butcher and his wife! Why, all Coreham
seems to be here! And how Mrs Coxe can afford such a gown I can't make
out for one, for I know Coxe had some difficulty in paying for the last
sheep he bought of my brother.'</DD>

<DD>
Just at this moment the band, consisting of two violins, a harp, and an
occasional clarionet, having finished their tuning, and brought themselves
as nearly into accord as was possible, struck up a brisk country-dance,
and partners quickly took their places. Mrs Gibson was secretly a little
annoyed at Cynthia's being one of those to stand up in this early dance,
the performers in which were principally the punctual plebeians of Hollingford,
who, when a ball was fixed to begin at eight, had no notion of being later,
and so losing part of the amusement for which they had paid their money.
She imparted some of her feelings to Molly, sitting by her, longing to
dance, and beating time to the spirited music with one of her pretty little
feet.</DD>

<DD>
'Your dear papa is always so very punctual! To-night it seems almost a
pity, for we really are here before there is any one come that we know.'</DD>

<DD>
'Oh! I see so many people here that I know. There are Mr and Mrs Smeaton,
and that nice good-tempered daughter.'</DD>

<DD>
'Oh! booksellers and butchers if you will.'</DD>

<DD>
'Papa has found a great many friends to talk to.'</DD>

<DD>
'Patients, my dear - hardly friends. There are some nice-looking people
here,' catching her eye on the Cholmleys; 'but I daresay they have driven
over from the neighbourhood of Ashcombe or Coreham, and have hardly calculated
how soon they would get here. I wonder when the Towers' party will come.
Ah! there's Mr Ashton, and Mr Preston. Come, the room is beginning to fill.'</DD>

<DD>
So it was, for this was to be a very good ball, people said; and a large
party from the Towers was coming, and a duchess in diamonds among the number.
Every great house in the district was expected to be full of guests on
these occasions; but, at this early hour, the townspeople had the floor
almost entirely to themselves; the county magnates came dropping in later;
and chiefest among them all was the lord-lieutenant from the Towers. But
to-night they were unusually late, and the aristocratic ozone being absent
from the atmosphere, there was a flatness about the dancing of all those
who considered themselves above the plebeian ranks of the tradespeople.
They, however, enjoyed themselves thoroughly, and sprang and pounded till
their eyes sparkled and their cheeks glowed with exercise and excitement.
Some of the more prudent parents, mindful of the next day's duties, began
to consider at what hour they ought to go home; but with all there was
an expressed or unexpressed curiosity to see the duchess and her diamonds;
for the Menteith diamonds were famous in higher circles than that now assembled;
and their fame had trickled down to it through the medium of ladies'-maids
and housekeepers. Mr Gibson had had to leave the ball-room for a time,
as he had anticipated, but he was to return to his wife as soon as his
duties were accomplished; and, in his absence, Mrs Gibson kept herself
a little aloof from the Miss Brownings and those of her acquaintance who
would willingly have entered into conversation with her, with the view
of attaching herself to the skirts of the Towers' party, when they should
make their appearance. If Cynthia would not be so very ready in engaging
herself to every possible partner who asked her to dance, there were sure
to be young men staying at the Towers who would be on the look-out for
pretty girls: and who could tell to what a dance would lead? Molly, too,
though a less good dancer than Cynthia, and, from her timidity, less graceful
and easy, was becoming engaged pretty deeply; and, it must be confessed,
she was longing to dance every dance, no matter with whom. Even she might
not be available for the more aristocratic partners Mrs Gibson anticipated.
She was feeling very much annoyed with the whole proceedings of the evening
when she was aware of some one standing by her; and, turning a little to
one side, she saw Mr Preston keeping guard, as it were, over the seats
which Molly and Cynthia had just quitted. He was looking so black that,
if their eyes had not met, Mrs Gibson would have preferred not speaking
to him; as it was, she thought it unavoidable.</DD>

<DD>
'The rooms are not well-lighted to-night, are they, Mr Preston?'</DD>

<DD>
'No,' said he; 'but who could light such dingy old paint as this, loaded
with evergreens, too, which always darken a room.'</DD>

<DD>
'And the company, too! I always think that freshness and brilliancy of
dress go as far as anything to brighten up a room. Look what a set of people
are here: the greater part of the women are dressed in dark silks, really
only fit for a morning. The place will be quite different, by-and-by, when
the county families are in a little more force.'</DD>

<DD>
Mr Preston made no reply. He had put his glass in his eye, apparently for
the purpose of watching the dancers. If its exact direction could have
been ascertained, it would have been found that he was looking intently
and angrily at a flying figure in pink muslin: many a one was gazing at
Cynthia with intentness besides himself, but no one in anger. Mrs Gibson
was not so fine an observer as to read all this; but here was a gentlemanly
and handsome young man, to whom she could prattle, instead of either joining
herself on to objectionable people, or sitting all forlorn until the Towers'
party came. So she went on with her small remarks.</DD>

<DD>
'You are not dancing, Mr Preston!'</DD>

<DD>
'No! The partner I had engaged has made some mistake. I am waiting to have
an explanation with her.'</DD>

<DD>
Mrs Gibson was silent. An uncomfortable tide of recollections appeared
to come over her; she, like Mr Preston, watched Cynthia; the dance was
ended, and she was walking round the room in easy unconcern as to what
might await her. Presently her partner, Mr Harry Cholmley, brought her
back to her seat. She took that vacant next to Mr Preston, leaving that
by her mother for Molly's occupation. The latter returned a moment afterwards
to her place. Cynthia seemed entirely unconscious of Mr Preston's neighbourhood.
Mrs Gibson leaned forwards, and said to her daughter, -</DD>

<DD>
'Your last partner was a gentleman, my dear. You are improving in your
selection. I really was ashamed of you before, figuring away with that
attorney's clerk. Molly, do you know whom you have been dancing with? I
have found out he is the Coreham bookseller.'</DD>

<DD>
'That accounts for his being so well up in all the books I have been wanting
to hear about,' said Molly, eagerly, but with a spice of malice in her
mind. 'He really was very pleasant, mamma,' she added; 'and he looks quite
a gentleman, and dances beautifully!'</DD>

<DD>
'Very well. But remember if you go on this way you will have to shake hands
over the counter to-morrow morning with some of your partners of to-night,'
said Mrs Gibson, coldly.</DD>

<DD>
'But I really don't know how to refuse when people are introduced to me
and ask me, and I am longing to dance. You know to-night it is a charity-ball,
and papa said everybody danced with everybody,' said Molly, in a pleading
tone of voice; for she could not quite and entirely enjoy herself if she
was out of harmony with any one. What reply Mrs Gibson would have made
to this speech cannot now be ascertained, for, before she could make reply,
Mr Preston stepped a little forwards, and said, in a tone which he meant
to be icily indifferent, but which trembled with anger, -</DD>

<DD>
'If Miss Gibson finds any difficulty in refusing a partner, she has only
to apply to Miss Kirkpatrick for instructions.'</DD>

<DD>
Cynthia lifted up her beautiful eyes, and, fixing them on Mr Preston's
face, said, very quietly, as if only stating a matter of fact, -</DD>

<DD>
'You forget, I think, Mr Preston: Miss Gibson implied that she wished to
dance with the person who asked her - that makes all the difference. I
can't instruct her how to act in that difficulty.'</DD>

<DD>
And to the rest of this little conversation, Cynthia appeared to lend no
car; and she was almost directly claimed by her next partner. Mr Preston
took the seat now left empty much to Molly's annoyance. At first she feared
lest he should be going to ask her to dance; but, instead, he put out his
hand for Cynthia's nosegay, which she had left on rising, entrusted to
Molly. It had suffered considerably from the heat of the room, and was
no longer full and fresh; not so much so as Molly's, which had not, in
the first instance, been pulled to pieces in picking out the scarlet flowers
which now adorned Molly's hair, and which had since been cherished with
more care. Enough, however, remained of Cynthia's to show very distinctly
that it was not the one Mr Preston had sent; and it was perhaps to convince
himself of this, that he mutely asked to examine it. But Molly, faithful
to what she imagined would be Cynthia's wish, refused to allow him to touch
it; she only held it a little nearer.</DD>

<DD>
'Miss Kirkpatrick has not done me the honour of wearing the bouquet I sent
her, I see. She received it, I suppose, and my note?'</DD>

<DD>
'Yes,' said Molly, rather intimidated by the tone in which this was said.
'But we had already accepted these two nosegays.'</DD>

<DD>
Mrs Gibson was just the person to come to the rescue with her honeyed words
on such an occasion as 'the present. She evidently was rather afraid of
Mr Preston, and wished to keep at peace with him.</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, yes, we were so sorry! Of course, I don't mean to say we could be
sorry for any one's kindness; but two such lovely nosegays had been sent
from Hamley Hall - you may see how beautiful from what Molly holds in her
hand - and they had come before yours, Mr Preston.'</DD>

<DD>
'I should have felt honoured if you had accepted of mine, since the young
ladies were so well provided for. I was at some pains in selecting the
flowers at Green's; I think I may say it was rather more <I>recherch&eacute;</I>
than that of Miss Kirkpatrick's, which Miss Gibson holds so tenderly and
securely in her hand.'</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, because Cynthia would take out the most effective flowers to put in
my hair!' exclaimed Molly, eagerly.</DD>

<DD>
'Did she?' said Mr Preston' with a certain accent of pleasure in his voice,
as though he were glad she set so little store by the nosegay; and he walked
off to stand behind Cynthia in the quadrille that was being danced; and
Molly saw him making her reply to him - against her will, Molly was sure.
But, somehow, his face and manner implied power over her. She looked grave,
deaf, indifferent, indignant, defiant; but, after a half-whispered speech
to Cynthia, at the conclusion of the dance, she evidently threw him an
impatient consent to what he was asking, for he walked off with a disagreeable
smile of satisfaction on his handsome face.</DD>

<DD>
All this time the murmurs were spreading at the lateness of the party from
the Towers, and person after person came up to Mrs Gibson as if she were
the accredited authority as to the earl and countess's plans. In one sense
this was flattering; but then the acknowledgment of common ignorance and
wonder reduced her to the level of the inquirers. Mrs Goodenough felt herself
particularly aggrieved; she had had her spectacles on for the last hour
and a half, in order to be ready for the sight the very first minute any
one from the Towers appeared at the door.</DD>

<DD>
'I had a headache,' she complained, 'and I should have sent my money, and
never stirred out o' doors to-night; for I've seen a many of these here
balls, and my lord and my lady too, when they were better worth looking
at nor they are now; but every one was talking of the duchess, and the
duchess and her diamonds, and I thought I shouldn't like to be behindhand,
and never ha' seen neither the duchess nor her diamonds; so I'm here, and
coal and candlelight wasting away at home, for I told Sally to sit up for
me; and, above everything, I cannot abide waste. I took it from my mother,
who was such a one against waste as you never see now-a-days. She was a
manager, if ever there was a one, and brought up nine children on less
than any one else could do, I'll be bound. Why! She wouldn't let us be
extravagant - not even in the matter of colds. Whenever any on us had got
a pretty bad cold, she took the opportunity and cut our hair; for she said,
said she, it was of no use having two colds when one would do - and cutting
of our hair was sure to give us a cold. But, for all that, I wish the duchess
would come.'</DD>

<DD>
'Ah! but fancy what it is to me,' sighed out Mrs Gibson; 'so long as I
have been without seeing the dear family - and seeing so little of them
the other day when I was at the Towers (for the duchess would have my opinion
on Lady Alice's trousseau, and kept asking me so many questions it took
up all the time) - and Lady Harriet's last words were a happy anticipation
of our meeting to-night. It's nearly twelve o'clock.'</DD>

<DD>
Every one of any pretensions to gentility was painfully affected by the
absence of the family from the Towers; the very fiddlers seemed unwilling
to begin playing a dance that might be interrupted by the entrance of the
great folks. Miss Phoebe Browning had apologized for them - Miss Browning
had blamed them with calm dignity; it was only the butchers and bakers
and candlestick-makers who rather enjoyed the absence of restraint, and
were happy and hilarious.</DD>

<DD>
At last, there was a rumbling, and a rushing, and a whispering, and the
music stopped, so the dancers were obliged to do so too, and in came Lord
Cumnor in his state dress, with a fat, middle-aged woman on his arm; she
was dressed almost like a girl - in a sprigged muslin, with natural flowers
in her hair, but not a vestige of a jewel or a diamond. Yet it must be
the duchess; but what was a duchess without diamonds? - and in a dress
which farmer Hodson's daughter might have worn! Was it the duchess? Could
it be the duchess? The little crowd of inquirers around Mrs Gibson thickened,
to hear her confirm their disappointing surmise. After the duchess came
Lady Cumnor, looking like Lady Macbeth in black velvet - a cloud upon her
brow, made more conspicuous by the lines of age rapidly gathering on her
handsome face; and Lady Harriet, and other ladies, amongst whom there was
one dressed so like the duchess as to suggest the idea of a sister rather
than a daughter, as far as dress went. There was Lord Hollingford, plain
in face, awkward in person, gentlemanly in manner; and half-a-dozen younger
men, Lord Albert Monson, Captain James, and others of their age and standing,
who came in looking anything if not critical. This long-expected party
swept up to the seats reserved for them at the head of the room, apparently
regardless of the interruption they caused; for the dancers stood aside,
and almost dispersed back to their seats, and when 'Money-musk" struck
up again, not half the former set of people stood up to finish the dance.</DD>

<DD>
Lady Harriet, who was rather different to Miss Piper, and no more minded
crossing the room alone than if the lookers-on were so many cabbages, spied
the Gibson party pretty quickly out, and came across to them.</DD>

<DD>
'Here we are at last. How d'ye do, dear? Why, little one' (to Molly), 'how
nice you're looking! Aren't we shamefully late?'</DD>

<DD>
'Oh! it's only just past twelve,' said Mrs Gibson; 'and I daresay you dined
very late.'</DD>

<DD>
'It was not that; it was that ill-mannered woman, who went to her own room
after we came out from dinner, and she and Lady Alice stayed there invisible,
till we thought they were putting on some splendid attire - as they ought
to have done - and at half-past ten when mamma sent up to them to say the
carriages were at the door, the duchess sent down for some beef-tea, and
at last appeared <I>&agrave; l'enfant</I> as you see her. Mamma is so angry
with her, and some of the others are annoyed at not coming earlier, and
one or two are giving themselves airs about coming at all. Papa is the
only one who is not affected by it.' Then turning to Molly Lady Harriet
asked, -</DD>

<DD>
'Have you been dancing much, Miss Gibson?'</DD>

<DD>
'Yes; not every dance, but nearly all.'</DD>

<DD>
It was a simple question enough; but Lady Harriet's speaking at all to
Molly had become to Mrs Gibson almost like shaking a red rag at a bull;
it was the one thing sure to put her out of temper. But she would not have
shown this to Lady Harriet for the world; only she contrived to baffle
any endeavours at further conversation between the two, by placing herself
between Lady Harriet and Molly, whom the former asked to sit down in the
absent Cynthia's room.</DD>

<DD>
'I won't go back to those people, I am so mad with them; and, besides,
I hardly saw you the other day, and I must have some gossip with you.'
So she sat down by Mrs Gibson, and as Mrs Goodenough afterwards expressed
it, 'looked like anybody else.' Mrs Goodenough said this to excuse herself
for a little misadventure she fell into. She had taken a deliberate survey
of the grandees at the upper end of the room, spectacles on nose, and had
inquired, in no very measured voice, who everybody was, from Mr Sheepshanks,
my lord's agent, and her very good neighbour, who in vain tried to check
her loud ardour for information by replying to her in whispers. But she
was rather deaf as well as blind, so his low tones only brought upon him
fresh inquiries. Now, satisfied as far as she could be, and on her way
to departure, and the extinguishing of fire and candlelight, she stopped
opposite to Mrs Gibson, and thus addressed her by way of renewal of their
former subject of conversation, -</DD>

<DD>
'Such a shabby thing for a duchess I never saw; not a bit of a diamond
near her. They're none of them worth looking at except the countess, and
she's always a personable woman, and not so lusty as she was. But they're
not worth waiting up for till this time o' night.'</DD>

<DD>
There was a moment's pause. Then Lady Harriet put her hand out, and said,
-</DD>

<DD>
'You don't remember me, but I know you from having seen you at the Towers.
Lady Cumnor is a good deal thinner than she was, but we hope her health
is better for it.'</DD>

<DD>
'It's Lady Harriet,' said Mrs Gibson to Mrs Goodenough, in reproachful
dismay.</DD>

<DD>
'Deary me, your ladyship! I hope I've given no offence! But, you see -
that is to say, your ladyship sees, that it's late hours for such folks
as me, and I only stayed out of my bed to see the duchess, and I thought
she'd come in diamonds and a coronet; and it puts one out at my age, to
be disappointed in the only chance I'm like to have of so fine a sight.'</DD>

<DD>
'I'm put out too,' said Lady Harriet. 'I wanted to have come early, and
here we are as late as this. I'm so cross and ill-tempered, I should be
glad to hide myself in bed as soon as you will do.'</DD>

<DD>
She said this so sweetly that Mrs Goodenough relaxed into a smile, and
her crabbedness into a compliment.</DD>

<DD>
'I don't believe as ever your ladyship can be cross and ill-tempered with
that pretty face. I'm an old woman, so you must let me say so.' Lady Harriet
stood up, and made a low curtsey. Then holding out her hand, she said,
-</DD>

<DD>
'I won't keep you up any longer; but I'll promise one thing in return for
your pretty speech: if ever I am a duchess, I'll come and show myself to
you in all my robes and gewgaws. Good-night, madam!'</DD>

<DD>
'There! I knew how it would be!' said she, not resuming her seat. 'And
on the eve of a county election too.'</DD>

<DD>
'Oh! you must not take old Mrs Goodenough as a specimen, dear Lady Harriet.
She is always a grumbler! I am sure no one else would complain of your
all being as late as you liked,' said Mrs Gibson.</DD>

<DD>
'What do you say, Molly?' said Lady Harriet, suddenly turning her eyes
on Molly's face. 'Don't you think we've lost some of our popularity, -
which at this time means votes - by coming so late. Come, answer me! you
used to be a famous little truth-teller.'</DD>

<DD>
'I don't know about popularity or votes,' said Molly, rather unwillingly.
'But I think many people were sorry you did not come sooner; and isn't
that rather a proof of popularity?' she added.</DD>

<DD>
'That's a very neat and diplomatic answer,' said Lady Harriet, smiling,
and tapping Molly's cheek with her fan.'</DD>

<DD>
'Molly knows nothing about it,' said Mrs Gibson, a little off her guard.
'It would be very impertinent if she or any one else questioned Lady Cumnor's
perfect right to come when she chose.'</DD>

<DD>
'Well, all I know is, I must go back to mamma now, but I shall make another
raid into these regions by-and-by, and you must keep a place for me. Ah!
there are - the Miss Brownings; you see I don't forget my lesson, Miss
Gibson.'</DD>

<DD>
'Molly, I cannot have you speaking so to Lady Harriet,' said Mrs Gibson,
as soon as she was left alone with her step-daughter. 'You would never
have known her at all if it had not been for me, and don't be always putting
yourself into our conversation.'</DD>

<DD>
'But I must speak if she asks me questions,' pleaded Molly.</DD>

<DD>
'Well! if you must, you must, I acknowledge. I'm candid about that at any
rate. But there's no need for you to set up to have an opinion at your
age.'</DD>

<DD>
'I don't know how to help it,' said Molly.</DD>

<DD>
'She's such a whimsical person; look there, if she's not talking to Miss
Phoebe; and Miss Phoebe is so weak she'll be easily led away into fancying
she is hand and glove with Lady Harriet. If there is one thing I hate more
than another, it is the trying to make out an intimacy with great people.'</DD>

<DD>
Molly felt innocent enough, so she offered no justification of herself,
and made no reply. Indeed she was more occupied in watching Cynthia. She
could not understand the change that seemed to have come over the latter.
She was dancing, it was true, with the same lightness and grace as before,
but the smooth bounding motion as of a feather blown onwards by the wind
was gone. She was conversing with her partner, but without the soft animation
that usually shone out upon her countenance. And when she was brought back
to her seat Molly noticed her changed colour, and her dreamily abstracted
eyes.</DD>

<DD>
'What is the matter, Cynthia?' asked she, in a very low voice.</DD>

<DD>
'Nothing,' said Cynthia, suddenly looking up, and in an accent of what
was in her, sharpness. 'Why should there be?'</DD>

<DD>
'I don't know; but you look different to what you did - tired or something.'</DD>

<DD>
'There is nothing the matter, or, if there is, don't talk about it. It
is all your fancy.'</DD>

<DD>
This was a rather contradictory speech, to be interpreted by intuition
rather than by logic. Molly understood that Cynthia wished for quietness
and silence. But what was her surprise, after the speeches that had passed
before, and the implication of Cynthia's whole manner to Mr Preston, to
see him come up, and, without a word, offer his arm to Cynthia and lead
her off to dance. It appeared to strike Mrs Gibson as something remarkable,
for, forgetting her late passage at arms with Molly, she asked, wanderingly,
as if almost distrusting the evidence of her senses, -</DD>

<DD>
'Is Cynthia going to dance with Mr Preston?'</DD>

<DD>
Molly had scarcely time to answer before she herself was led off by her
partner. She could hardly attend to him or to the figures of the quadrille
for watching for Cynthia among the moving forms.</DD>

<DD>
Once she caught a glimpse of her standing still - downcast - listening
to Mr Preston's eager speech. Again she was walking languidly among the
dancers, almost as if she took no notice of those around her. When she
and Molly joined each other again, the shade on Cynthia's face had deepened
to gloom. But, at the same time, if a physiognomist had studied her expression,
he would have read in it defiance and anger, and perhaps also a little
perplexity. While this quadrille had been going on, Lady Harriet had been
speaking to her brother.</DD>

<DD>
'Hollingford!' she said, laying her hand on his arm, and drawing him a
little apart from the well-born crowd amid which he stood, silent and abstracted,
'you don't know how these good people here have been hurt and disappointed
with our being so late, and with the duchess's ridiculous simplicity of
dress.'</DD>

<DD>
'Why should they mind it?' asked he, taking advantage of her being out
of breath with eagerness.</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, don't be so wise and stupid; don't you see, we're a show and a spectacle
- it's like having a pantomime with harlequin and columbine in plain clothes."</DD>

<DD>
'I don't understand how -- ' he began.</DD>

<DD>
'Then take it upon trust. They really are a little disappointed, whether
they are logical or not in being so, and we must try and make it up to
them; for one thing, because I can't bear our vassals to look dissatisfied
and disloyal, and then there's the election in June.'</DD>

<DD>
'I really would as soon be out of the House as in it.'</DD>

<DD>
'Nonsense; it would grieve papa beyond measure - but there is no time to
talk about that now. You must go and dance with some of the townspeople,
and I'll ask Sheepshanks to introduce me to a respectable young farmer.
Can't you get Captain James to make himself useful? There he goes with
Lady Alice! If I don't get him introduced to the ugliest tailor's daughter
I can find for the next dance!' She put her arm in her brother's as she
spoke, as if to lead him to some partner. He resisted, however - resisted
piteously.</DD>

<DD>
'Pray don't, Harriet. You know I can't dance. I hate it; I always did.
I don't know how to get through a quadrille.'</DD>

<DD>
'It's a country dance!' said she, resolutely.</DD>

<DD>
'It's all the same. And what shall I say to my partner? I haven't a notion:
I shall have no subject in common. Speak of being disappointed, they'll
be ten times more disappointed when they find I can neither dance nor talk!'</DD>

<DD>
'I'll be merciful; don't be so cowardly. In their eyes a lord may dance
like a bear - as some lords not very far from me are - if he likes, and
they'll take it for grace. And you shall begin with Molly Gibson, your
friend the doctor's daughter. She's a good, simple, intelligent little
girl, which you'll think a great deal more of, I suppose, than of the frivolous
fact of her being very pretty, Clare! will you allow me to introduce my
brother to Miss Gibson? he hopes to engage her for this dance. Lord Hollingford,
Miss Gibson!'</DD>

<DD>
Poor Lord Hollingford! there was nothing for it but for him to follow his
sister's very explicit lead, and Molly and he walked off to their places,
each heartily wishing their dance together well over. Lady Harriet flew
off to Mr Sheepshanks to secure her respectable young farmer, and Mrs Gibson
remained alone, wishing that Lady Cumnor would send one of her attendant
gentlemen for her. It would be so much more agreeable to be sitting even
at the fag-end of nobility than here on a bench with everybody; hoping
that everybody would see Molly dancing away with a lord, yet vexed that
the chance had so befallen that Molly instead of Cynthia was the young
lady singled out; wondering if simplicity of dress was now become the highest
fashion, and pondering on the possibility of cleverly inducing Lady Harriet
to introduce Lord Albert Monson to her own beautiful daughter, Cynthia.</DD>

<DD>
Molly found Lord Hollingford, the wise and learned Lord Hollingford, strangely
stupid in understanding the mystery of 'Cross hands and back again, down
the middle and up again.' He was constantly getting hold of the wrong hands,
and as constantly stopping when he had returned to his place, quite unaware
that the duties of society and the laws of the dance required that he should
go on capering till he had arrived at the bottom of the room. He perceived
that he had performed his part very badly, and apologized to Molly when
once they had arrived at that haven of comparative peace, and he expressed
his regret so simply and heartily that she felt at her ease with him at
once, especially when he had confided to her his reluctance at having to
dance at all, and his only doing it under his sister's compulsion. To Molly
he was an elderly widower, almost as old as her father, and by-and-by they
got into very pleasant conversation. She learnt from him that Roger Hamley
had just been publishing a paper in some scientific periodical, which had
excited considerable attention, as it was intended to confute some theory
of a great French physiologist, and Roger's article proved the writer to
be possessed of a most unusual amount of knowledge on the subject. This
piece of news was of great interest to Molly, and, in her questions, she
herself evinced so much intelligence, and a mind so well prepared for the
reception of information, that Lord Hollingford at any rate would have
felt his quest of popularity a very easy affair indeed, if he might have
gone on talking quietly to Molly during the rest of the evening. When he
took her back to her place, he found Mr Gibson there, and fell into talk
with him, until Lady Harriet once more came to stir him up to his duties.
Before very long, however, he returned to Mr Gibson's side, and began telling
him of this paper of Roger Hamley's, of which Mr Gibson had not yet heard.
In the midst of their conversation, as they stood close by Mrs Gibson,
Lord Hollingford saw Molly in the distance, and interrupted himself to
say, 'What a charming little lady that daughter of yours is! Most girls
of her age are so difficult to talk to; but she is intelligent and full
of interest in all sorts of sensible things; well read, too - she was up
in <I>Le R&eacute;gne Animal</I> - and very pretty!'</DD>

<DD>
Mr Gibson bowed, much pleased at such a compliment from such a man, was
he lord or not. It is very likely that if Molly had been a stupid listener,
Lord Hollingford would not have discovered her beauty, or the converse
might be asserted - if she had not been young and pretty he would not have
exerted himself to talk on scientific subjects in a manner which she could
understand. But in whatever manner Molly had won his approbation and admiration,
there was no doubt that she had earned it somehow. And, when she next returned
to her place, Mrs Gibson greeted her with soft words and a gracious smile;
for it does not require much reasoning power to discover that if it is
a very fine thing to be mother-in-law to a very magnificent three-tailed
bashaw, it presupposes that the wife who makes the connection between the
two parties is in harmony with her mother. And so far had Mrs Gibson's
thoughts wandered into futurity. She only wished that the happy chance
had fallen to Cynthia's instead of to Molly's lot. But Molly was a docile,
sweet creature, very pretty, and remarkably intelligent, as my lord had
said. It was a pity that Cynthia preferred making millinery to reading;
but perhaps that could be rectified. And there was Lord Cumnor coming to
speak to her, and Lady Cumnor nodding to her, and indicating a place by
her side.</DD>

<DD>
It was not an unsatisfactory ball upon the whole to Mrs Gibson, although
she paid the usual penalty for sitting up beyond her usual hour in perpetual
glare and movement. The next morning she awoke irritable and fatigued;
and a little of the same feeling oppressed both Cynthia and Molly. The
former was lounging in the window-seat, holding a three-days-old newspaper
in her hand, which she was making a pretence of reading, when she was startled
by her mother's saying, -</DD>

<DD>
'Cynthia! can't you take up a book and improve yourself. I am sure your
conversation will never be worth listening to, unless you read something
better than newspapers. Why don't you keep up your French? There was some
French book that Molly was reading - <I>Le R&eacute;gne Animal</I>, I think.'</DD>

<DD>
'No! I never read it!' said Molly, blushing. 'Mr Roger Hamley sometimes
read pieces out of it when I was first at the Hall, and told me what it
was about.'</DD>

<DD>
'Oh! well. Then I suppose I was mistaken. But it comes to all the same
thing. Cynthia, you really must learn to settle yourself to some improving
reading every morning.'</DD>

<DD>
Rather to Molly's surprise, Cynthia did not reply a word; but dutifully
went and brought down from among her Boulogne school-books, <I>Le Si&egrave;cle
de Louis XIV</I>. But after a while Molly saw that this 'improving reading'
was just as much a mere excuse for Cynthia's thinking her own thoughts
as the newspaper had been.</DD>
