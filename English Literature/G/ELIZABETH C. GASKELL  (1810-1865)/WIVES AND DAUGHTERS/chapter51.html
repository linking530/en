'TROUBLES NEVER COME ALONE'</H4></CENTER>

<DL>
<DD>
Molly had her out-of-door things on, and she crept away as she was bidden;
she lifted her heavy weight of heart and body along till she came to a
field, not so very far off, - where she had sought the comfort of loneliness
ever since she was a child; and there, under the hedge-bank, she sate down,
burying her face in her hands, and quivering all over as she thought of
Cynthia's misery, that she might not try to touch or assuage. She never
knew how long she sate there, but it was long past lunch-time when once
again she stole up to her room. The door opposite was open wide, - Cynthia
had quitted the chamber. Molly arranged her dress and went down into the
drawing-room. Cynthia and her mother sate there in the stern repose of
an armed neutrality. Cynthia's face looked made of stone, for colour and
rigidity; but she was netting away as if nothing unusual had occurred.
Not so Mrs Gibson: her face bore evident marks of tears, and she looked
up and greeted Molly's entrance with a faint smiling notice. Cynthia went
on as though she had never heard the opening of the door, or felt the approaching
sweep of Molly's dress. Molly took up a book, - not to read, but to have
the semblance of some employment which should not necessitate conversation.</DD>

<DD>
There was no measuring the duration of the silence that ensued. Molly grew
to fancy it was some old enchantment that weighed upon their tongues and
kept them still. At length Cynthia spoke, but she had to begin again before
her words came clear, -</DD>

<DD>
'I wish you both to know that henceforward all is at an end between me
and Roger Hamley.'</DD>

<DD>
Molly's book went down upon her knees; with open eyes and lips she strove
to draw in Cynthia's meaning. Mrs Gibson spoke querulously, as if injured,
-</DD>

<DD>
'I could have understood this if it had happened three months ago, - when
you were in London; but now it's just nonsense, Cynthia, and you know you
don't mean it!'</DD>

<DD>
Cynthia did not reply; nor did the resolute look on her face change when
Molly spoke at last, -</DD>

<DD>
'Cynthia - think of him! It will break his heart!'</DD>

<DD>
'No!' said Cynthia, 'it will not. But even if it did, I cannot help it.'</DD>

<DD>
'All this talk will soon pass away!' said Molly; 'and when he knows the
truth from your own self -- '</DD>

<DD>
'From my own self he shall never hear it. I do not love him well enough
to go through the shame of having to excuse myself, - to plead that he
will reinstate me in his good opinion. Confession may be - well! I can
never believe it pleasant - but it may be an ease of mind if one makes
it to some people, - to some person, - and it may not be a mortification
to sue for forgiveness. I cannot tell. All I know is, - and I know it clearly,
and will act upon it inflexibly - that -- ' And there she stopped short.</DD>

<DD>
'I think you might finish your sentence,' said her mother, after a silence
of five seconds.</DD>

<DD>
'I cannot bear to exculpate myself to Roger Hamley. I will not submit to
his thinking less well of me than he has done, - however foolish his judgment
may have been. I would rather never see him again, for these two reasons.
And the truth is, I do not love him. I like him, I respect him; but I will
not marry him. I have written to tell him so. That was merely as a relief
to myself, for when or where the letter will reach him -- And I have written
to old Mr Hamley. The relief is the one good thing come out of it all.
It is such a comfort to feel free again. It wearied me so to think of straining
up to his goodness. "Extenuate my conduct!"' she concluded, quoting Mr
Gibson's words. Yet when Mr Gibson came home, after a silent dinner, she
asked to speak with him, alone, in his consulting-room; and there laid
bare the exculpation of herself which she had given to Molly many weeks
before. When she had ended, she said, -</DD>

<DD>
'And now, Mr Gibson, - I still treat you like a friend, - help me to find
some home far away, where all the evil talking and gossip mamma tells me
of cannot find me and follow me. It may be wrong to care for people's good
opinion, - but it is me, and I cannot alter myself. You, Molly, - all the
people in the town, - I have not the patience to live through the nine
days' wonder. I want to go away and be a governess.'</DD>

<DD>
'But, my dear Cynthia, - how soon Roger will be back, - a tower of strength.'</DD>

<DD>
'Has not mamma told you I have broken it all off with Roger? I wrote this
morning. I wrote to his father. That letter will reach to-morrow. I wrote
to Roger. If he ever receives that letter I hope to be far away by that
time; in Russia may be.'</DD>

<DD>
'Nonsense. An engagement like yours cannot be broken off, except by mutual
consent. You have only given others a great deal of pain, without freeing
yourself. Nor will you wish it in a month's time. When you come to think
calmly you will be glad to think of the stay and support of such a husband
as Roger. You have been in fault, and have acted foolishly at first, -
perhaps wrongly afterwards; but you don't want your husband to think you
faultless?'</DD>

<DD>
'Yes, I do,' said Cynthia. 'At any rate, my lover must think me so. And
it is just because I do not love him even as so light a thing as I could
love, that I feel that I could not bear to have to tell him I'm sorry,
and stand before him like a chidden child to be admonished and forgiven.'</DD>

<DD>
'But here you are, just in such a position before me, Cynthia!'</DD>

<DD>
'Yes! but I love you better than Roger; I have often told Molly so. And
I would have told you, if I had not expected and hoped to leave you all
before long. I could see if the recollection of it all came up before your
mind; I could see it in your eyes; I should know it by instinct. I have
a fine instinct for reading the thoughts of others when they refer to me.
I almost hate the idea of Roger judging me by his own standard, which was
not made for me, and graciously forgiving me at last.'</DD>

<DD>
'Then I do believe it is right for you to break it off,' said Mr Gibson,
almost as if he was thinking to himself. 'That poor lad! But it will be
best for him too. And he'll get over it. He has a good strong heart. Poor
old Roger!'</DD>

<DD>
For a moment Cynthia's wilful fancy stretched after the object passing
out of her grasp, - Roger's love became for the instant a treasure; but,
again, she knew that in its entirety of high undoubting esteem, as well
as of passionate regard, it would no longer be hers; and for the flaw which
she herself had made, she cast it away, and would none of it. Yet often
in after years, when it was too late, she wondered, and strove to penetrate
the inscrutable mystery of 'what would have been.'</DD>

<DD>
'Still take till to-morrow before you act upon your decision,' said Mr
Gibson, slowly. 'What faults you have fallen into have been mere girlish
faults at first, - leading you into much deceit, I grant.'</DD>

<DD>
'Don't give yourself the trouble to define the shades of blackness,' said
Cynthia, bitterly. 'I am not so obtuse but what I know them all better
than any one can tell me. And as for my decision I acted upon it at once.
It may be long before Roger gets my letter, - but I hope he is sure to
get it at last, - and, as I said, I have let his father know; it won't
hurt him! Oh, sir, I think if I had been differently brought up I should
not have had the sore angry heart I have. Now! No, don't! I don't want
reasoning comfort. I can't stand it. I should always have wanted admiration
and worship, and men's good opinion. Those unkind gossips! To visit Molly
with their hard words! Oh, dear! I think life is very dreary.'</DD>

<DD>
She put her head down on her hands; tired out mentally as well as bodily.
So Mr Gibson thought. He felt as if much speech from him would only add
to her excitement, and make her worse. He left the room, and called Molly,
from where she was sitting, dolefully. 'Go to Cynthia!' he whispered, and
Molly went. She took Cynthia into her arms with gentle power, and laid
her head against her own breast, as if the one had been a mother, and the
other a child.</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, my darling!' she murmured. 'I do so love you, dear, dear Cynthia!'
and she stroked her hair, and kissed her eyelids; Cynthia passive all the
while, till suddenly she started up stung with a new idea, and looking
Molly straight in the face, she said, -</DD>

<DD>
'Molly, Roger will marry you! See if it is not so! You two good -- '</DD>

<DD>
But Molly pushed her away with a sudden violence of repulsion. 'Don't!'
she said. She was crimson with shame and indignation. 'Your husband this
morning! Mine to-night! What do you take him for?'</DD>

<DD>
'A man!' smiled Cynthia. 'And therefore, if you won't let me call him changeable,
I'll coin a word and call him consolable!' But Molly gave her back no answering
smile. At this moment, the servant Maria entered the consulting-room, where
the two girls were. She had a scared look.</DD>

<DD>
'Is not master here?' asked she, as if she distrusted her eyes.</DD>

<DD>
'No!' said Cynthia. 'I heard him go out. I heard him shut the front door
not five minutes ago.'</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, dear!' said Maria. 'And there's a man come on horseback from Hamley
Hall, and he says Mr Osborne is dead, and that master must go off to the
squire straight away!'</DD>

<DD>
'Osborne Hamley dead?' said Cynthia, in awed surprise. Molly was out at
the front door, seeking the messenger through the dusk, round into the
stable-yard, where the groom sate motionless on his dark horse, flecked
with foam, made visible by the lantern placed on the steps near, where
it had been left by the servants, who were dismayed at this news of the
handsome young man who had frequented their master's house, so full of
sportive elegance and winsomeness. Molly went up to the man, whose thoughts
were lost in recollection of the scene he had left at the place he had
come from.</DD>

<DD>
She laid her hand on the hot damp skin of the horse's shoulder; the man
started.</DD>

<DD>
'Is the doctor coming, Miss?' For he saw who it was by the dim light.</DD>

<DD>
'He is dead, is he not?' asked Molly, in a low voice.</DD>

<DD>
'I'm afeard he is, - leastways there is no doubt according to what they
said. But I have ridden hard! there may be a chance. Is the doctor coming,
Miss?'</DD>

<DD>
'He is gone out. They are seeking him, I believe. I will go myself. Oh!
the poor old squire.' She went into the kitchen - went over the house with
swift rapidity to gain news of her father's whereabouts. The servants knew
no more than she did. Neither she nor they had heard what Cynthia, ever
quick of perception, had done. The shutting of the front door had fallen
on deaf cars, as far as others were concerned. Upstairs sped Molly to the
drawing-room, where Mrs Gibson stood at the door, listening to the unusual
stir in the house.</DD>

<DD>
'What is it, Molly? Why, how white you look, child!'</DD>

<DD>
'Where's papa?'</DD>

<DD>
'Gone out. What's the matter?'</DD>

<DD>
'Where?'</DD>

<DD>
'How should I know? I was asleep; Jenny came upstairs on her way to the
bedrooms; she's a girl who never keeps to her work, and Maria takes advantage
of her.'</DD>

<DD>
'Jenny, Jenny!' cried Molly, frantic at the delay.</DD>

<DD>
'Don't shout, dear, - ring the bell. What can be the matter?'</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, Jenny!' said Molly, half way up the stairs to meet her, 'who wanted
papa?'</DD>

<DD>
Cynthia came to join the group; she too had been looking for traces or
tidings of Mr Gibson.</DD>

<DD>
'What is the matter?' said Mrs Gibson. 'Can nobody speak and answer a question?'</DD>

<DD>
'Osborne Hamley is dead!' said Cynthia, gravely.</DD>

<DD>
'Dead! Osborne! Poor fellow! I knew it would be so, though, - I was sure
of it. But Mr Gibson can do nothing if he's dead. Poor young man! I wonder
where Roger is now? He ought to come home.'</DD>

<DD>
Jenny bad been blamed for coming into the drawing-room instead of Maria,
whose place it was, and so had lost the few wits she had. To Molly's hurried
questions her replies had been entirely unsatisfactory. A man had come
to the back door - she could not see who it was - she had not asked his
name: he wanted to speak to master, - master had seemed in a hurry, and
only stopped to get his hat.</DD>

<DD>
'He will not be long away,' thought Molly, 'or he would have left word
where he was going. But oh! the poor father all alone.' And then a thought
came into her head, which she acted upon straight. 'Go to James, tell him
to put the side-saddle I had in November on Nora Creina. Don't cry, Jenny.
There's no time for that. No one is angry with you. Run!'</DD>

<DD>
So down into the cluster of collected women Molly came, equipped in her
jacket and skirt; quick determination in her eyes; controlled quivering
about the corners of her mouth.</DD>

<DD>
'Why, what in the world,' said Mrs Gibson, - 'Molly, what are you thinking
about?' But Cynthia had understood it at a glance, and was arranging Molly's
hastily assumed dress, as she passed along.</DD>

<DD>
'I am going. I must go. I cannot bear to think of him alone. When papa
comes back he is sure to go to Hamley, and if I am not wanted, I can come
back with him.' She heard Mrs Gibson's voice following her in remonstrance,
but she did not stay for words. She had to wait in the stable-yard, and
she wondered how the messenger could bear to eat and drink the food and
beer brought out to him by the servants. Her coming out had evidently interrupted
the eager talk, - the questions and answers passing sharp to and fro; but
she caught the words, 'all amongst the tangled grass,' and 'the squire
would let none on us touch him: he took him up as if he was a baby; he
had to rest many a time, and once he sate him down on the ground; but still
he kept him in his arms; but we thought we should ne'er have gotten him
up again - him and the body.'</DD>

<DD>
'The body!'</DD>

<DD>
Molly had never felt that Osborne was really dead till she heard those
words. They rode quick under the shadows of the budding hedgerow trees,
but when they slackened speed, to go up a brow, or to give their horses
breath, Molly heard those two little words again in her cars; and said
them over again to herself, in hopes of forcing the sharp truth into her
unwilling sense. But when they came in sight of the square stillness of
the house, shining in the moonlight - the moon had risen by this time -
Molly caught at her breath, and for an instant she thought she never could
go in, and face the presence in that dwelling. One yellow light burnt steadily,
spotting the silver shining with its earthly coarseness. The man pointed
it out: it was almost the first word he had spoken since they had left
Hollingford.</DD>

<DD>
'It's the old nursery. They carried him there. The squire broke down at
the stair-foot, and they took him to the readiest place. I'll be bound
for it the squire is there hisself, and old Robin too. They fetched him,
as a knowledgable man among dumb beasts, till th' regular doctor came.'</DD>

<DD>
Molly dropped down from her seat before the man could dismount to help
her. She gathered up her skirts and did not stay again to think of what
was before her. She ran along the once familiar turns, and swiftly up the
stairs, and through the doors, till she came to the last; then she stopped
and listened. It was a deathly silence. She opened the door: the squire
was sitting alone at the side of the bed, holding the dead man's hand,
and looking straight before him at vacancy. He did not stir or move, even
so much as an eyelid, at Molly's entrance. The truth had entered his soul
before this, and he knew that no doctor, be he ever so cunning, could,
with all his striving, put the breath into that body again. Molly came
up to him with the softest steps, the most hushed breath that ever she
could. She did not speak, for she did not know what to say. She felt that
he had no more hope from earthly skill, so what was the use of speaking
of her father and the delay in his coming? After a moment's pause, standing
by the old man's side, she slipped down to the floor, and sate at his feet.
Possibly her presence might have some balm in it; but uttering of words
was as a vain thing. He must have been aware of her being there, but he
took no apparent notice. There they sate, silent and still, he in his chair,
she on the floor; the dead man, beneath the sheet, for a third. She fancied
that she must have disturbed the father in his contemplation of the quiet
face, now more than half, but not fully, covered up out of sight. Time
had never seemed so without measure, silence had never seemed so noiseless
as it did to Molly, sitting there. In the acuteness of her senses she heard
a step mounting a distant staircase, coming slowly, coming nearer. She
knew it not to be her father's, and that was all she cared about. Nearer
and nearer - close to the outside of the door - a pause, and a soft hesitating
tap. The great gaunt figure sitting by her side quivered at the sound.
Molly rose and went to the door: it was Robinson, the old butler, holding
in his hand a covered basin of soup.</DD>

<DD>
'God bless you, Miss,' said he; 'make him touch a drop o' this: he's gone
since breakfast without food, and it's past one in the morning now.'</DD>

<DD>
He softly removed the cover, and Molly took the basin back with her to
her place at the squire's side. She did not speak, for she did not well
know what to say, or how to present this homely want of nature before one
so rapt in grief. But she put a spoonful to his lips, and touched them
with the savoury food, as if he had been a sick child, and she the nurse;
and instinctively he took down the first spoonful of the soup. But in a
minute he said, with a sort of cry, and almost overturning the basin Molly
held, by his passionate gesture as he pointed to the bed, -</DD>

<DD>
'He will never eat again - never.'</DD>

<DD>
Then he threw himself across the corpse, and wept in such a terrible manner
that Molly trembled lest he also should die - should break his heart there
and then. He took no more notice of her words, of her tears, of her presence,
than he did of that of the moon, looking through the unclosed window, with
passionless stare, Her father stood by them both. before either of them
was aware.</DD>

<DD>
'Go downstairs, Molly,' said he gravely; but he stroked her head tenderly
as she rose. 'Go into the dining-room.' Now she felt the reaction from
all her self-control. She trembled with fear as she went along the moonlit
passages. It seemed to her as if she should meet Osborne, and hear it all
explained; how he came to die, - what he now felt and thought and wished
her to do. She did get down to the dining-room, - the last few steps with
a rush of terror, - senseless terror of what might be behind her; and there
she found supper laid out, and candles lit, and Robinson bustling about
decanting some wine. She wanted to cry; to get into some quiet place, and
weep away her over-excitement; but she could hardly do so there. She only
felt very much tired, and to care for nothing in this world any more. But
vividness of life came back when she found Robinson holding a glass to
her lips as she sate in the great leather easy-chair, to which she had
gone instinctively as to a place of rest.</DD>

<DD>
'Drink, Miss. It's good old Madeira. Your papa said as how you was to eat
a bit. Says he, "My daughter may have to stay here, Mr Robinson, and she's
young for the work. Persuade her to eat something, or she'll break down
utterly." Those was his very words.'</DD>

<DD>
Molly did not say anything. She had not energy enough for resistance. She
drank and she ate at the old servant's bidding; and then she asked him
to leave her alone, and went back to her easy-chair and let herself cry,
and so ease her heart.</DD>
