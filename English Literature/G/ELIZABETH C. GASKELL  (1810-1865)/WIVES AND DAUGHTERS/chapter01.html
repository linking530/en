THE DAWN OF A GALA DAY</H4></CENTER>

<DL>
<DD>
To begin with the old rigmarole of childhood. In a country there was a
shire, and in that shire there was a town, and in that town there was a
house, and in that house there was a room, and in that room there was a
bed, and in that bed there lay a little girl; wide awake and longing to
get up, but not daring to do so for fear of the unseen power in the next
room - a certain Betty, whose slumbers must not be disturbed until six
o'clock struck, when she wakened of herself 'as sure as clockwork', and
left the household very little peace afterwards. It was a June morning,
and early as it was, the room was full of sunny warmth and light.</DD>

<DD>
On the drawers opposite to the little white dimity bed in which Molly Gibson
lay, was a primitive kind of bonnet-stand on which was hung a bonnet, carefully
covered over from any chance of dust, with a large cotton handkerchief,
of so heavy and serviceable a texture that if the thing underneath it had
been a flimsy fabric of gauze and lace and flowers, it would have been
altogether 'scromfished' (again to quote from Betty's vocabulary). But
the bonnet was made of solid straw, and its only trimming was a plain white
ribbon put over the crown, and forming the strings. Still, there was a
neat little quilling inside, every plait of which Molly knew, for had she
not made it herself the evening before, with infinite pains? and was there
not a little blue bow in this quilling, the very first bit of such finery
Molly had ever had the prospect of wearing?</DD>

<DD>
Six o'clock now! the pleasant, brisk ringing of the church bells told that;
calling every one to their daily work, as they had done for hundreds of
years. Up jumped Molly, and ran with her bare little feet across the room,
and lifted off the handkerchief and saw once again the bonnet; the pledge
of the gay bright day to come. Then to the window, and after some tugging
she opened the casement, and let in the sweet morning air. The dew was
already off the flowers in the garden below, but still rising from the
long hay-grass in the meadows directly beyond. At one side lay the little
town of Hollingford, into a street of which Mr. Gibson's front door opened;
and delicate columns, and little puffs of smoke were already beginning
to rise from many a cottage chimney where some housewife was already up,
and preparing breakfast for the bread-winner of the family.</DD>

<DD>
Molly Gibson saw all this, but all she thought about it was, 'Oh! it will
be a fine day! I was afraid it never, never would come; or that, if it
ever came, it would be a rainy day!' Five-and-forty years ago, children's
pleasures in a country town were very simple, and Molly had lived for twelve
long years without the occurrence of any event so great as that which was
now impending. Poor child! it is true that she had lost her mother, which
was a jar to the whole tenour of her life; but that was hardly an event
in the sense referred to; and besides, she had been too young to be conscious
of it at the time. The pleasure she was looking forward to to-day was her
first share in a kind of annual festival in Hollingford.</DD>

<DD>
The little straggling town faded away into country on one side close to
the entrance-lodge of a great park, where lived my Lord and Lady Cumnor
'the earl' and 'the countess', as they were always called by the inhabitants
of the town; where a very pretty amount of feudal feeling still lingered,
and showed itself in a number of simple ways, droll enough to look back
upon, but serious matters of importance at the time. It was before the
passing of the Reform Bill, but a good deal of liberal talk took place
occasionally between two or three of the more enlightened freeholders living
in Hollingford; and there was a great Tory family in the county who, from
time to time, came forward and contested the election with the rival Whig
family of Cumnor. One would have thought that the above-mentioned liberal-talking
inhabitants would have, at least, admitted the possibility of their voting
for the Hely-Harrison, and thus trying to vindicate their independence
But no such thing. 'The earl' was lord of the manor, and owner of much
of the land on which Hollingford was built; he and his household were fed,
and doctored, and, to a certain measure, clothed by the good people of
the town; their fathers' grandfathers had always voted for the eldest son
of Cumnor Towers, and following in the ancestral track every man-jack in
the place gave his vote to the liege lord, totally irrespective of such
chimeras as political opinion.</DD>

<DD>
This was no unusual instance of the influence of the great landowners over
humbler neighbours in those days before railways, and it was well for a
place where the powerful family, who thus overshadowed it, were of so respectable
a character as the Cumnors. They expected to be submitted to, and obeyed;
the simple worship of the townspeople was accepted by the earl and countess
as a right; and they would have stood still in amazement, and with a horrid
memory of the French sansculottes who were the bugbears of their youth,
had any inhabitant of Hollingford ventured to set his will or opinions
in opposition to those of the earl. But, yielded all that obeisance, they
did a good deal for the town, and were generally condescending, and often
thoughtful and kind in their treatment of their vassals. Lord Cumnor was
a forbearing landlord; putting his steward a little on one side sometimes,
and taking the reins into his own hands now and then, much to the annoyance
of the agent, who was, in fact, too rich and independent to care greatly
for preserving a post where his decisions might any day be overturned by
my lord's taking a fancy to go 'pottering' (as the agent irreverently expressed
it in the sanctuary of his own home), which, being interpreted, meant that
occasionally the earl asked his own questions of his own tenants, and used
his own eyes and ears in the management of the smaller details of his property.
But his tenants liked my lord all the better for this habit of his. Lord
Cumnor had certainly a little time for gossip, which he contrived to combine
with the failing of personal intervention between the old land-steward
and the tenantry. But, then, the countess made up by her unapproachable
dignity for this weakness of the earl's. Once a year she was condescending.
She and the ladies, her daughters<!--daughters-->, had set up a school;
not a school after the manner of schools now-a-days, where far better intellectual
teaching is given to the boys and girls of labourers and workpeople than
often falls to the lot of their betters in worldly estate; but a school
of the kind we should call 'industrial', where girls are taught to sew
beautifully, to be capital housemaids, and pretty fair cooks, and, above
all, to dress neatly in a kind of charity uniform devised by the ladies
of Cumnor Towers; - white caps, white tippets, check aprons, blue gowns,
and ready curtseys, and 'please, ma'ams', being <I>de rigueur</I>.</DD>

<DD>
Now, as the countess was absent from the Towers for a considerable part
of the year, she was glad to enlist the sympathy of the Hollingford ladies
in this school, with a view to obtaining their aid as visitors during the
many months that she and her daughters<!--daughters--> were away. And the
various unoccupied gentlewomen of the town responded to the call of their
liege lady, and gave her their service as required; and along with it,
a great deal of whispered and fussy admiration. 'How good of the countess!
So like the dear countess - always thinking of others!' and so on; while
it was always supposed that no strangers had seen Hollingford properly,
unless they had been taken to the countess's school, and been duly impressed
by the neat little pupils, and the still neater needlework there to be
inspected. In return, there was a day of honour set apart every summer,
when with much gracious and stately hospitality, Lady Cumnor and her daughters<!--daughters-->
received all the school visitors at the Towers, the great family mansion
standing in aristocratic seclusion in the centre of the large park, of
which one of the lodges was close to the little town. The order of this
annual festivity was this. About ten o'clock one of the Towers' carriages
rolled through the lodge, and drove to different houses, wherein dwelt
a woman to be honoured; picking them up by ones or twos, till the loaded
carriage drove back again through the ready portals, bowled along the smooth
tree-shaded road, and deposited its covey of smartly-dressed ladies on
the great flight of steps leading to the ponderous doors of Cumnor Towers.
Back again to the town; another picking up of womankind in their best clothes,
and another return, and so on till the whole party were assembled either
in the house or in the really beautiful gardens. After the proper amount
of exhibition on the one part, and admiration on the other, had been done,
there was a collation for the visitors, and some more display and admiration
of the treasures inside the house. Towards four o'clock, coffee was brought
round; and this was a signal of the approaching carriage that was to take
them back to their own homes; whither they returned with the happy consciousness
of a well-spent day, but with some fatigue at the long-continued exertion
of behaving their best, and talking on stilts for so many hours. Nor were
Lady Cumnor and her daughters<!--daughters--> free from something of the
same self-approbation, and something, too, of the same fatigue; the fatigue
that always follows on conscious efforts to behave as will best please
the society you are in.</DD>

<DD>
For the first time in her life, Molly Gibson was to be included among the
guests at the Towers. She was much too young to be a visitor at the school,
so it was not on that account that she was to go; but it had so happened
that one day when Lord Cumnor was on a 'pottering' expedition, he had met
Mr. Gibson, <I>the</I> doctor of the neighbourhood, coming out of the farm-house
my lord was entering; and having some small question to ask the surgeon
(Lord Cumnor seldom passed any one of his acquaintance without asking a
question of some sort - not always attending to the answer; it was his
mode of conversation), he accompanied Mr. Gibson to the out-building, to
a ring in the wall of which the surgeon's horse was fastened. Molly was
there too, sitting square and quiet on her rough little pony, waiting for
her father. Her grave eyes opened large and wide at the close neighbourhood
and evident advance of 'the earl'; for to her little imagination the grey-haired,
red-faced, somewhat clumsy man, was a cross between an archangel and a
king.</DD>

<DD>
'Your daughter, eh, Gibson? - nice little girl, how old? Pony wants grooming
though,' patting it as he talked. 'What's your name, my dear? He's sadly
behindhand with his rent, as I was saying, but if he's really ill, I must
see after Sheepshanks, who is a hardish man of business. What's his complaint?
You'll come to our school-scrimmage on Thursday, little girl - what's-your-name?
Mind you send her, or bring her, Gibson; and just give a word to your groom,
for I'm sure that pony wasn't singed last year, now, was he? Don't forget
Thursday, little girl - what's your name? - it's a promise between us,
is it not?' And off the earl trotted, attracted by the sight of the farmer's
eldest son on the other side of the yard.</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Gibson mounted, and he and Molly rode off. They did not speak for some
time. Then she said, 'May I go, papa?' in rather an anxious little tone
of voice.</DD>

<DD>
'Where, my dear?' said he, wakening up out of his own professional thoughts.</DD>

<DD>
'To the Towers - on Thursday, you know. That gentleman' (she was shy of
calling him by his title) 'asked me.'</DD>

<DD>
'Would you like it, my dear? It has always seemed to me rather a tiresome
piece of gaiety - rather a tiring day, I mean - beginning so early - and
the heat, and all that.'</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, papa!' said Molly reproachfully.</DD>

<DD>
'You'd like to go then, would you?'</DD>

<DD>
'Yes if I may! - He asked me, you know. Don't you think I may? - he asked
me twice over.'</DD>

<DD>
'Well! we'll see - yes! I think we can manage it, if you wish it so much,
Molly.'</DD>

<DD>
Then they were silent again. By-and-by, Molly said:</DD>

<DD>
'Please, papa - I do wish to go - but I don't care about it.'</DD>

<DD>
'That's rather a puzzling speech. But I suppose you mean you don't care
to go, if it will be any trouble to get you there. I can easily manage
it, however, so you may consider it settled. You'll want a white frock,
remember; you'd better tell Betty you're going, and she'll see after making
you tidy.'</DD>

<DD>
Now, there were two or three things to be done by Mr. Gibson, before he
could feel quite comfortable about Molly's going to the festival at the
Towers, and each of them involved a little trouble on his part. But he
was very willing to gratify his little girl; so the next day he rode over
to the Towers, ostensibly to visit some sick housemaid, but, in reality,
to throw himself in my lady's way, and get her to ratify Lord Cumnor's
invitation to Molly. He chose his time, with a little natural diplomacy;
which, indeed, he had often to exercise in his intercourse with the great
family. He rode into the stable-yard about twelve o'clock, a little before
luncheon-time, and yet after the worry of opening the post-bag and discussing
its contents was over. After he had put up his horse, he went in by the
back-way to the house; the 'House' on this side, the 'Towers' at the front.
He saw his patient, gave his directions to the housekeeper, and then went
out, with a rare wild-flower in his hand, to find one of the ladies Tranmere
in the garden, where, according to his hope and calculation, he came upon
Lady Cumnor too - now talking to her daughter about the contents of an
open letter which she held in her hand, now directing a gardener about
certain bedding-out plants.</DD>

<DD>
'I was calling to see Nanny, and I took the opportunity of bringing Lady
Agnes the plant I was telling her about as growing on Cumnor Moss.'</DD>

<DD>
'Thank you so much, Mr. Gibson. Mamma, look! this is the <I>Drosera rotundifolia</I>
I have been wanting so long.'</DD>

<DD>
'Ah! yes; very pretty I daresay, only I am no botanist. Nanny is better,
I hope? We can't have any one laid up next week, for the house will be
quite full of people - and here are the Danbys waiting to offer themselves
as well. One comes down for a fortnight of quiet, at Whitsuntide, and leaves
half one's establishment in town, and as soon as people know of our being
here, we get letters without end, longing for a breath of country air,
or saying how lovely the Towers must look in spring; and I must own, Lord
Cumnor is a great deal to blame for it all, for as soon as ever we are
down here, he rides about to all the neighbours, and invites them to come
over and spend a few days.'</DD>

<DD>
'We shall go back to town on Friday the 18th,' said Lady Agnes, in a consolatory
tone.</DD>

<DD>
'Ah, yes! as soon as we have got over the school visitors' affair. But
it is a week to that happy day.'</DD>

<DD>
'By the way!' said Mr. Gibson, availing himself of the good opening thus
presented, 'I met my lord at the Cross-trees Farm yesterday, and he was
kind enough to ask my little daughter, who was with me, to be one of the
party here on Thursday; it would give the lassie great pleasure, I believe.'
He paused for Lady Cumnor to speak.</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, well! if my lord asked her, I suppose she must come, but I wish he
was not so amazingly hospitable! Not but what the little girl will be quite
welcome; only, you see, he met a younger Miss Browning the other day, of
whose existence I had never heard.'</DD>

<DD>
'She visits at the school, mamma,' said Lady Agnes.</DD>

<DD>
'Well, perhaps she does; I never said she did not. I knew there was one
visitor of the name of Browning; I never knew there were two, but, of course,
as soon as Lord Cumnor heard there was another, he must needs ask her;
so the carriage will have to go backwards and forwards four times now to
fetch them all. So your daughter can come quite easily, Mr. Gibson, and
I shall be very glad to see her for your sake. She can sit bodkin with
the Brownings, I suppose? You'll arrange it all with them; and mind you
get Nanny well up to her work next week.'</DD>

<DD>
Just as Mr. Gibson was going away, Lady Cumnor called after him, 'Oh! by-the-bye,
Clare is here; you remember Clare, don't you? She was a patient of yours,
long ago.'</DD>

<DD>
'Clare!' he repeated, in a bewildered tone.</DD>

<DD>
'Don't you recollect her? Miss Clare, our old governess,' said Lady Agnes.
'About twelve or fourteen years ago, before Lady Cuxhaven was married.'</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, yes!' said he. 'Miss Clare, who had the scarlet fever here; a very
pretty delicate girl. But I thought she was married!'</DD>

<DD>
'Yes!' said Lady Cumnor. 'She was a silly little thing, and did not know
when she was well off; we were all very fond of her, I'm sure. She went
and married a poor curate, and became a stupid Mrs. Kirkpatrick; but we
always kept on calling her 'Clare.' And now he's dead, and left her a widow,
and she is staying here; and we are racking our brains to find out some
way of helping her to a livelihood without parting her from her child.
She's somewhere about the grounds, if you like to renew your acquaintance
with her.'</DD>

<DD>
'Thank you, my lady. I'm afraid I cannot stop to-day. I have a long round
to go; I've stayed here too long as it is, I'm afraid.'</DD>

<DD>
Long as his ride had been that day, he called on the Miss Brownings in
the evening, to arrange about Molly's accompanying them to the Towers.
They were tall handsome women, past their first youth, and inclined to
be extremely complaisant to the widowed doctor.</DD>

<DD>
'Eh dear! Mr. Gibson, but we shall he delighted to have her with us. You
should never have thought of asking us such a thing,' said Miss Browning
the elder.</DD>

<DD>
'I'm sure I'm hardly sleeping at nights for thinking of it,' said Miss
Phoebe. 'You know I've never been there before. Sister has many a time;
but somehow, though my name has been down on the visitors' list these three
years, the countess has never named me in her note; and you know I could
not push myself into notice, and go to such a grand place without being
asked; how could I?'</DD>

<DD>
'I told Phoebe last year,' said her sister, 'that I was sure it was only
inadvertence, as one may call it, on the part of the countess, and that
her ladyship would be as hurt as any one when she didn't see Phoebe among
the school visitors; but Phoebe has got a delicate mind, you see Mr. Gibson,
and for all I could say she wouldn't go, but stopped here at home; and
it spoilt all my pleasure all that day, I do assure you, to think of Phoebe's
face, as I saw it over the window-blinds, as I rode away; her eyes were
full of tears, if you'll believe me.'</DD>

<DD>
'I had a good cry alter you was gone, Sally,' said Miss Phoebe; 'but for
all that, I think I was right in stopping away from where I was not asked.
Don't you, Mr. Gibson?'</DD>

<DD>
'Certainly,' said he. 'And you see you are going this year; and last year
it rained.'</DD>

<DD>
'Yes! I remember! I set myself to tidy my drawers, to string myself up,
as it were; and I was so taken up with what I was about that I was quite
startled when I heard the rain beating against the window-panes. 'Goodness
me!' said I to myself, 'whatever will become of sister's white satin shoes,
if she has to walk about on soppy grass after such rain as this?' for,
you see, I thought a deal about her having a pair of smart shoes; and this
year she has gone and got me a white satin pair just as smart as hers,
for a surprise.'</DD>

<DD>
'Molly will know she's to put on her best clothes,' said Miss Browning.
'We could perhaps lend her a few beads, or artificials, if she wants them.'</DD>

<DD>
'Molly must go in a clean white frock,' said Mr. Gibson, rather hastily;
for he did not admire the Miss Brownings' taste in dress, and was unwilling
to have his child decked up according to their fancy; he esteemed his old
servant Betty's as the more correct, because the more simple. Miss Browning
had just a shade of annoyance in her tone as she drew herself up, and said,
'Oh! very well. It's quite right, I'm sure.' But Miss Phoebe said, 'Molly
will look very nice in whatever she puts on, that's certain.'</DD>
