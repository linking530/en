<DD>
The wedding went off much as such affairs do. Lord Cumnor and Lady Harriet
drove over from the Towers, so the hour for the ceremony was as late as
possible. Lord Cumnor came over to officiate as the bride's father, and
was in more open glee than either bride or bridegroom, or any one else.
Lady Harriet came as a sort of amateur bridesmaid, to 'share Molly's duties,'
as she called it. They went from the Manor-house in two carriages to the
church in the park, Mr Preston and Mr Gibson in one, and Molly, to her
dismay, shut up with Lord Cumnor and Lady Harriet in the other. Lady Harriet's
gown of white muslin had seen one or two garden-parties, and was not in
the freshest order; it had been rather a freak of the young lady's at the
last moment. She was very merry, and very much inclined to talk to Molly,
by way of finding out what sort of a little personage Clare was to have
for her future daughter. She began, -</DD>

<DD>
'We mustn't crush this pretty muslin dress of yours. Put it over papa's
knee; he doesn't mind it in the least.'</DD>

<DD>
'What, my dear, a white dress! - no, to be sure not. I rather like it.
Besides, going to a wedding, who minds anything? It would be different
if we were going to a funeral.'</DD>

<DD>
Molly conscientiously strove to find out the meaning of this speech; but
before she had done so, Lady Harriet spoke again, going to the point, as
she always piqued herself on doing.</DD>

<DD>
'I daresay it's something of a trial to you, this second marriage of your
father's; but you'll find Clare the most amiable of women. She always let
me have my own way, and I've no doubt she'll let you have yours.'</DD>

<DD>
'I mean to try and like her,' said Molly, in a low voice, trying hard to
keep down the tears that would keep rising to her eyes this morning. 'I've
seen very little of her yet.'</DD>

<DD>
'Why, it's the very best thing for you that could have happened, my dear,'
said Lord Cumnor. 'You're growing up into a young lady - and a very pretty
young lady, too, if you'll allow an old man to say so - and who so proper
as your father's wife to bring you out, and show you off, and take you
to balls, and that kind of thing? I always said this match that is going
to come off to-day was the most suitable thing I ever knew; and it's even
a better thing for you than for the people themselves.'</DD>

<DD>
'Poor child!' said Lady Harriet, who had caught a sight of Molly's troubled
face, 'the thought of balls is too much for her just now; but you'll like
having Cynthia Kirkpatrick for a companion, shan't you, dear?'</DD>

<DD>
'Very much,' said Molly, cheering up a little. 'Do you know her?'</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, I've seen her over and over again when she was a little girl, and
once or twice since. She's the prettiest creature that you ever saw; and
with eyes that mean mischief, if I'm not mistaken. But Clare kept her spirit
under pretty well when she was staying with us, - afraid of her being troublesome,
I fancy.'</DD>

<DD>
Before Molly could shape her next question, they were at the church; and
she and Lady Harriet went into a pew near the door to wait for the bride,
in whose train they were to proceed to the altar. The earl drove on alone
to fetch her from her own house, not a quarter of a mile distant. It was
pleasant to her to be led to the hymeneal altar by a belted earl, and pleasant
to have his daughter as a volunteered bridesmaid. Mrs Kirkpatrick in this
flush of small gratifications, and on the brink of matrimony with a man
whom she liked, and who would be bound to support her without any exertion
of her own, looked beamingly happy and handsome. A little cloud came over
her face at the sight of Mr Preston, - the sweet perpetuity of her smile
was rather disturbed as he followed in Mr Gibson's wake. But his face never
changed; he bowed to her gravely, and then seemed absorbed in the service.
Ten minutes, and all was over. The bride and bridegroom were driving <I>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</I>
to the Manor-house, Mr Preston was walking thither by a short cut, and
Molly was again in the carriage with my lord, rubbing his hands and chuckling,
and Lady Harriet, trying to be kind and consolatory, when her silence would
have been the best comfort.</DD>

<DD>
Molly found out, to her dismay, that the plan was for her to return with
Lord Cumnor and Lady Harriet when they went back to the Towers in the evening.
In the meantime Lord Cumnor had business to do with Mr Preston, and after
the happy couple had driven off on their week's holiday tour, she was to
be left alone with the formidable Lady Harriet. When they were by themselves
after all the others had been thus disposed of, Lady Harriet sate still
over the drawing-room fire, holding a screen' between it and her face,
but gazing intently at Molly for a minute or two. Molly was fully conscious
of this prolonged look, and was trying to get up her courage to return
the stare, when Lady Harriet suddenly said, -</DD>

<DD>
'I like you; - you are a little wild creature, and I want to tame you.
Come here, and sit on this stool by me. What is your name? or what do they
call you? - as North-country people would express it.'</DD>

<DD>
'Molly Gibson. My real name is Mary.'</DD>

<DD>
'Molly is a nice, soft-sounding name. People in the last century weren't
afraid of homely names; now we are all so smart and fine: no more "Lady
Bettys" now. I almost wonder they haven't re-christened all the worsted
and knitting-cotton that bears her name. Fancy Lady Constantia's cotton,
or Lady Anna-Maria's worsted.'</DD>

<DD>
'I didn't know there was a Lady Betty's cotton,' said Molly.</DD>

<DD>
'That proves you don't do fancy-work! You'll find Clare will set you to
it, though. She used to set me at piece after piece: knights kneeling to
ladies; impossible flowers. But I must do her the justice to add that when
I got tired of them she finished them herself. I wonder how you'll get
on together?'</DD>

<DD>
'So do I!' sighed out Molly, under her breath.</DD>

<DD>
'I used to think I managed her, till one day an uncomfortable suspicion
arose that all the time she had been managing me. Still it's easy work
to let oneself be managed; at any rate till one wakens up to the consciousness
of the process, and then it may become amusing, if one takes it in that
light.'</DD>

<DD>
'I should hate to be managed,' said Molly, indignantly. 'I'll try and do
what she wishes for papa's sake, if she'll only tell me outright; but I
should dislike to be trapped into anything.'</DD>

<DD>
'Now I,' said Lady Harriet, 'am too lazy to avoid traps; and I rather like
to remark the cleverness with which they're set. But then of course I know
that, if I choose to exert myself, I can break through the withes of green
flax with which they try to bind me. Now, perhaps, you won't be able.'</DD>

<DD>
'I don't quite understand what you mean,' said Molly.</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, well - never mind; I daresay it's as well for you that you shouldn't.
The moral of all I have been saying is, "Be a good girl, and suffer yourself
to be led, and you'll find your new stepmother the sweetest creature imaginable."
You'll get on capitally with her, I make no doubt. How you'll get on with
her daughter is another affair; but I daresay very well. Now we'll ring
for tea; for I suppose that heavy breakfast is to stand for our lunch.'</DD>

<DD>
Mr Preston came into the room just at this time, and Molly was a little
surprised at Lady Harriet's cool manner of dismissing him, remembering
as she did how Mr Preston had implied his intimacy with her ladyship the
evening before at dinner-time.</DD>

<DD>
'I cannot bear that sort of person,' said Lady Harriet, almost before he
was out of hearing; 'giving himself airs of gallantry towards one to whom
his simple respect is all his duty. I can talk to one of my father's labourers
with pleasure, while with a man like that underbred fop I am all over thorns
and nettles. What is it the Irish call that style of creature? They've
got some capital word for it, I know. What is it?'</DD>

<DD>
'I don't know - I never heard it,' said Molly, a little ashamed of her
ignorance.</DD>

<DD>
'Oh! that shows you've never read Miss Edgeworth's tales; - now, have you?
If you had, you'd have recollected that there was such a word, even if
you didn't remember what it was. If you've never read those stories, they
would be just the thing to beguile your solitude - vastly improving and
moral, and yet quite sufficiently interesting. I'll lend them to you while
you're all alone.'</DD>

<DD>
'I'm not alone. I'm not at home, but on a visit to the Miss Brownings.'</DD>

<DD>
'Then I'll bring them to you. I know the Miss Brownings; they used to come
regularly on the school-day to the Towers. Pecksy and Flapsy I used to
call them. I like the Miss Brownings; one gets enough of respect from them
at any rate; and I've always wanted to see the kind of <I>m&eacute;nage</I>
of such people. I'll bring you a whole pile of Miss Edgeworth's stories,
my dear.'</DD>

<DD>
Molly sate quite silent for a minute or two; then she mustered up courage
to speak out what was in her mind.</DD>

<DD>
'Your ladyship' (the title was the firstfruits of the lesson, as Molly
took it, on paying due respect) - 'your ladyship keeps speaking of the
sort of - the class of people to which I belong as if it was a kind of
strange animal you were talking about; yet you talk so openly to me that
-- '</DD>

<DD>
'Well, go on - I like to hear you.'</DD>

<DD>
Still silence.</DD>

<DD>
'You think me in your heart a little impertinent - now, don't you?' said
Lady Harriet, almost kindly.</DD>

<DD>
Molly held her peace for two or three moments; then she lifted her beautiful,
honest eyes to Lady Harriet's face, and said, -</DD>

<DD>
'Yes! - a little. But I think you a great many other things.'</DD>

<DD>
'We'll leave the "other things" for the present. Don't you see, little
one, I talked after my kind, just as you talk after your kind. It's only
on the surface with both of us. Why, I daresay some of your good Hollingford
ladies talk of the poor people in a manner which they would consider as
impertinent in their turn, if they could hear it. But I ought to be more
considerate when I remember how often my blood has boiled at the modes
of speech and behaviour of one of my aunts, mamma's sister, Lady -- No!
I won't name names. Any one who earns his livelihood by an exercise of
head or hands, from professional people and rich merchants down to labourers,
she calls "persons." She would never in her most slip-slop talk accord
them even the conventional title of "gentlemen;" and the way in which she
takes possession of human beings, "my woman," "my people," - but, after
all, it is only a way of speaking. I ought not to have used it to you;
but somehow I separate you from all these Hollingford people.'</DD>

<DD>
'But why?' persevered Molly. 'I'm one of them.'</DD>

<DD>
'Yes, you I are. But - now don't reprove me again for impertinence - most
of them are so unnatural in their exaggerated respect and admiration when
they come up to the Towers, and put on so much pretence by way of fine
manners, that they only make themselves objects of ridicule. You at least
are simple and truthful, and that's why I separate you in my own mind from
them, and have talked unconsciously to you as I would -- Well! now here's
another piece of impertinence - as I would to my equal - in rank, I mean;
for I don't set myself up in solid things as any better than my neighbours.
Here's tea, however, come in time to stop me from growing too humble.'</DD>

<DD>
It was a very pleasant little tea in the fading September twilight. just
as it was ended, in came Mr Preston again.</DD>

<DD>
'Lady Harriet, will you allow me the pleasure of showing you some alterations
I have made in the flower-garden - in which I have tried to consult your
taste - before it grows dark?'</DD>

<DD>
'Thank you, Mr Preston. I will ride over with papa some day, and we will
see if we approve of them.'</DD>

<DD>
Mr Preston's brow flushed. But he affected not to perceive Lady Harriet's
haughtiness, and, turning to Molly, he said, -</DD>

<DD>
'Will not you come out, Miss Gibson, and see something of the gardens?
You haven't been out at all, I think, excepting to church.'</DD>

<DD>
Molly did not like the idea of going out for a <I>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</I>
walk with Mr Preston; yet she pined for a little fresh air, would have
liked to have seen the gardens, and have looked at the Manor-house from
different aspects; and, besides this, much as she recoiled from Mr Preston,
she felt sorry for him under the repulse he had just received. While she
was hesitating, and slowly tending towards consent, Lady Harriet spoke,
-</DD>

<DD>
'I cannot spare Miss Gibson. If she would like to see the place, I will
bring her over some day myself.'</DD>

<DD>
When he had left the room, Lady Harriet said, -</DD>

<DD>
'I daresay it's my own lazy selfishness has kept you indoors all day against
your will. But, at any rate, you are not to go out walking with that man.
I've an instinctive aversion to him; not entirely instinctive either; it
has some foundation in fact; and I desire you don't allow him ever to get
intimate with you. He's a very clever land-agent, and does his duty by
papa, and I don't choose to be taken up for libel; but remember what I
say!'</DD>

<DD>
Then the carriage came round, and after numberless last words from the
earl - who appeared to have put off every possible direction to the moment
when he stood, like an awkward Mercury, balancing himself on the step of
the carriage - they drove back to the Towers.</DD>

<DD>
'Would you rather come in and dine with us - we should send you home, of
course - or go home straight?' asked Lady Harriet of Molly. She and her
father had both been sleeping till they drew up at the bottom of the flight
of steps.</DD>

<DD>
'Tell the truth, now and evermore. Truth is generally amusing, if it's
nothing else!'</DD>

<DD>
'I would rather go back to Miss Brownings' at once, please,' said Molly,
with a nightmare-like recollection of the last, the only evening she had
spent at the Towers.</DD>

<DD>
Lord Cumnor was standing on the steps, waiting to hand his daughter out
of the carriage. Lady Harriet stopped to kiss Molly on the forehead, and
to say, -</DD>

<DD>
'I shall come some day soon, and bring you a load of Miss Edgeworth's tales,
and make further acquaintance with Pecksy and Flapsy.'</DD>

<DD>
'No, don't, please,' said Molly, taking hold of her, to detain her. 'You
must not come - indeed you must not.'</DD>

<DD>
'Why not?'</DD>

<DD>
'Because I would rather not - because I think that I ought not to have
any one coming to see me who laughs at the friends I am staying with, and
calls them names.' Molly's heart beat very fast, but she meant every word
that she said.</DD>

<DD>
'My dear little woman!' said Lady Harriet, bending over her and speaking
quite gravely. 'I'm very sorry to have called them names - very, very sorry
to have hurt you. If I promise you to be respectful to them in word and
deed - and in very thought, if I can - you'll let me then, won't you?'</DD>

<DD>
Molly hesitated. 'I'd better go home at once; I shall only say wrong things
- and there's Lord Cumnor waiting all this time.'</DD>

<DD>
'Let him alone; he's very well amused hearing all the news of the day from
Brown. Then I shall come - under promise?'</DD>

<DD>
So Molly drove off in solitary grandeur; and Miss Brownings' knocker was
loosened on its venerable hinges by the never-ending peal of Lord Cumnor's
footman.</DD>

<DD>
They were full of welcome, full of curiosity. All through the long day
they had been missing their bright young visitor, and three or four times
in every hour they had been wondering and settling what everybody was doing
at that exact minute. What had become of Molly during all the afternoon,
had been a great perplexity to them; and they were very much oppressed
with a sense of the great honour she had received in being allowed to spend
so many hours <I>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</I> with Lady Harriet.
They were, indeed, more excited by this one fact than by all the details
of the wedding, most of which they had known of beforehand, and talked
over with much perseverance during the day. Molly began to feel as if there
was some foundation for Lady Harriet's inclination to ridicule the worship
paid by the good people of Hollingford to their liege lords, and to wonder
with what tokens of reverence they would receive Lady Harriet if she came
to pay her promised visit. She had never thought of concealing the probability
of this call until this evening; but now she felt as if it would be better
not to speak of the chance, as she was not at all sure if the promise would
be fulfilled.</DD>

<DD>
Before Lady Harriet's call was paid, Molly received another visit. Roger
Hamley came riding over one day with a note from his mother, and a wasps'-nest
as a present from himself. Molly heard his powerful voice come sounding
up the little staircase, as he asked if Miss Gibson was at home from the
servant-maid at the door; and she was half amused and half annoyed as she
thought how this call of his would give colour to Miss Browning's fancies.
'I would rather never be married at all,' thought she, 'than marry an ugly
man, - and dear good Mr Roger is really ugly; I don't think one could even
call him plain.' Yet the Miss Brownings, who did not look upon young men
as if their natural costume was a helmet and a suit of armour, thought
Mr Roger Hamley a very personable young fellow, as he came into the room,
his face flushed with exercise, his white teeth showing pleasantly in the
courteous bow and smile he gave to all around. He knew the Miss Brownings
slightly, and talked pleasantly to them while Molly read Mrs Hamley's little
missive of sympathy and good wishes relating to the wedding; then he turned
to her, and though the Miss Brownings listened with all their ears, they
could not find out anything remarkable either in the words he said or the
tone in which they were spoken.</DD>

<DD>
'I've brought you the wasps'-nest I promised you, Miss Gibson. There has
been no lack of such things this year; we've taken seventy-four on my father's
land alone; and one of the labourers, a poor fellow who ekes out his wages
by bee-keeping, has had a sad misfortune - the wasps have turned the bees
out of his seven hives, taken possession, and eaten up the honey.'</DD>

<DD>
'What greedy little vermin!' said Miss Browning.</DD>

<DD>
Molly saw Roger's eyes twinkle at the misapplication of the word;' but
though he had a strong sense of humour, it never appeared to diminish his
respect for the people who amused him.</DD>

<DD>
'I'm sure they deserve fire and brimstone more than the poor dear innocent
bees,' said Miss Phoebe. 'And then it seems so ungrateful of mankind, who
are going to feast on the honey!' She sighed over the thought, as if it
was too much for her.</DD>

<DD>
While Molly finished reading her note, he explained its contents to Miss
Browning.</DD>

<DD>
'My brother and I are going with my father to an agricultural meeting at
Canonbury on Thursday, and my mother desired me to say to you how very
much obliged to you she should be if you would spare her Miss Gibson for
the day. She was very anxious to ask for the pleasure of your company,
too, but she really is so poorly that we persuaded her to be content with
Miss Gibson, as she wouldn't scruple leaving a young lady to amuse herself,
which she would be unwilling to do if you and your sister were there.'</DD>

<DD>
'I'm sure she's very kind; very. Nothing would have given us more pleasure,'
said Miss Browning, drawing herself up in gratified dignity. 'Oh, yes,
we quite understand, Mr Roger; and we fully recognize Mrs Hamley's kind
intention. We will take the will for the deed, as the common people express
it. I believe that there was an intermarriage between the Brownings and
the Hamleys, a generation or two ago.'</DD>

<DD>
'I daresay there was,' said Roger. 'My mother is very delicate, and obliged
to humour her health, which has made her keep aloof from society.'</DD>

<DD>
'Then I may go?' said Molly, sparkling with the idea of seeing her dear
Mrs Hamley again, yet afraid of appearing too desirous of leaving her kind
old friends.</DD>

<DD>
'To be sure, my dear. Write a pretty note, and tell Mrs Hamley how much
obliged to her we are for thinking of us.'</DD>

<DD>
'I'm afraid I can't wait for a note,' said Roger. 'I must take a message
instead, for I have to meet my father at one o'clock, and it's close upon
it now.'</DD>

<DD>
When he was gone, Molly felt so light-hearted at the thoughts of Thursday
that she could hardly attend to what the Miss Brownings were saying. One
was talking about the pretty muslin gown which Molly had sent to the wash
only that morning, and contriving how it could be had back again in time
for Molly to wear; and the other, Miss Phoebe, totally inattentive to her
sister's speaking for a wonder, was piping out a separate strain of her
own, and singing Roger Hamley's praises.</DD>

<DD>
'Such a fine-looking young man, and so courteous and affable. Like the
young men of our youth now, is he not, sister? And yet they all say Mr
Osborne is the handsomest. What do you think, child?'</DD>

<DD>
'I've never seen Mr Osborne,' said Molly, blushing, and hating herself
for doing so. Why was it? She had never seen him as she said. It was only
that her fancy had dwelt on him so much.</DD>

<DD>
He was gone; all the gentlemen were gone before the carriage, which came
to fetch Molly on Thursday, reached Hamley Hall. But Molly was almost glad,
she was so much afraid of being disappointed. Besides, she had her dear
Mrs Hamley the more to herself; the quiet sit in the morning-room, talking
poetry and romance; the mid-day saunter into the garden, brilliant with
autumnal flowers and glittering dew-drops on the gossamer webs that stretched
from scarlet to blue, and thence to purple and yellow petals. As they were
sitting at lunch, a strange man's voice and step were heard in the hall;
the door was opened, and a young man came in, who could be no other than
Osborne. He was beautiful and languid-looking, almost as frail in appearance
as his mother, whom he strongly resembled. This seeming delicacy made him
appear older than he was. He was dressed to perfection, and yet with easy
carelessness. He came up to his mother, and stood by her, holding her hand,
while his eyes sought Molly, not boldly or impertinently, but as if appraising
her critically.</DD>

<DD>
'Yes! I'm back again. Bullocks, I find, are not in my line. I only disappointed
my father in not being able to appreciate their merits, and, I'm afraid,
I didn't care to learn. And the smell was insufferable on such a hot day.'</DD>

<DD>
'My dear boy, don't make apologies to me; keep them for your father. I'm
only too glad to have you back. Miss Gibson, this tall fellow is my son
Osborne, as I daresay you have guessed. Osborne - Miss Gibson. Now, what
will you have?'</DD>

<DD>
He looked round the table as he sate down. 'Nothing here,' said he. 'Is
there not some cold game-pie? I'll ring for that.'</DD>

<DD>
Molly was trying to reconcile the ideal with the real. The ideal was agile,
yet powerful, with Greek features and an eagle-eye, capable of enduring
long fasting, and indifferent as to what he ate. The real was almost effeminate
in movement, though not in figure; he had the Greek features, but his blue
eyes had a cold, weary expression in them. He was dainty in eating, and
had anything but a Homeric appetite. However, Molly's hero was not to eat
more than Ivanhoe, when he was Friar Tuck's guest;' and, after all, with
a little alteration, she began to think Mr Osborne Hamley might turn out
a poetical, if not a chivalrous hero. He was extremely attentive to his
mother, which pleased Molly, and, in return, Mrs Hamley seemed charmed
with him to such a degree that Molly once or twice fancied that mother
and son would have been happier in her absence. Yet, again, it struck on
the shrewd, if simple girl, that Osborne was mentally squinting at her
in the conversation which was directed to his mother. There were little
turns and '<I>fioriture</I>' of speech which Molly could not help feeling
were graceful antics of language not common in the simple daily intercourse
between mother and son. But it was flattering rather than otherwise to
perceive that a very fine young man, who was a poet to boot, should think
it worth while to talk on the tight rope for her benefit. And before the
afternoon was ended, without there having been any direct conversation
between Osborne and Molly, she had reinstated him on his throne in her
imagination; indeed, she had almost felt herself disloyal to her dear Mrs
Hamley when, in the first hour after her introduction, she had questioned
his claims on his mother's idolatry. His beauty came out more and more,
as he became animated in some discussion with her; and all his attitudes,
if a little studied, were graceful in the extreme. Before Molly left, the
squire and Roger returned from Canonbury.</DD>

<DD>
'Osborne here!' said the squire, red and panting. 'Why the deuce couldn't
you tell us you were coming home? I looked about for you everywhere, just
as we were going into the ordinary. I wanted to introduce you to Grantley,
and Fox, and Lord Forrest-men from the other side of the county, whom you
ought to know; and Roger there missed above half his dinner hunting about
for you; and all the time you'd stole away, and were quietly sitting here
with the women. I wish you'd let me know the next time you make off. I've
lost half my pleasure in looking at as fine a lot of cattle as I ever saw,
with thinking you might be having one of your old attacks of faintness.'</DD>

<DD>
'I should have had one, I think, if I'd stayed longer in that atmosphere.
But I'm sorry if I've caused you anxiety.'</DD>

<DD>
'Well! well!' said the squire, somewhat mollified. 'And Roger, too, - there
I've been sending him here and sending him there all the afternoon.'</DD>

<DD>
'I didn't mind it, sir. I was only sorry you were so uneasy. I thought
Osborne had gone home, for I knew it wasn't much in his way,' said Roger.</DD>

<DD>
Molly intercepted a glance between the two brothers - a look of true confidence
and love, which suddenly made her like them both under the aspect of relationship
- new to her observation.</DD>

<DD>
Roger came up to her, and sate down by her.</DD>

<DD>
'Well, and how are you getting on with Huber; don't you find him very interesting?'</DD>

'I'm afraid,' said Molly, penitently, 'I haven't read much. The Miss Brownings
like me to talk; and, besides, there is so much to do at home before papa
comes back; and Miss Browning doesn't like me to go without her. I know
it sounds nothing, but it does take up a great deal of time.'</DD>

<DD>
'When is your father coming back?'</DD>

<DD>
'Next Tuesday, I believe. He cannot stay long away.'</DD>

<DD>
'I shall ride over and pay my respects to Mrs Gibson,' said he. 'I shall
come as soon as I may. Your father has been a very kind friend to me ever
since I was a boy. And when I come, I shall expect my pupil to have been
very diligent,' he concluded, smiling his kind, pleasant smile at idle
Molly.</DD>

<DD>
Then the carriage came round, and she had the long solitary drive back
to Miss Brownings'. It was dark out of doors when she got there; but Miss
Phoebe was standing on the stairs, with a lighted candle in her hand, peering
into the darkness to see Molly come in.</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, Molly! I thought you'd never come back. Such a piece of news! Sister
has gone to bed; she's had a headache - with the excitement, I think; but
she says it's new bread. Come upstairs softly, my dear, and I'll tell you
what it is! Who do you think has been here, - drinking tea with us, too,
in the most condescending manner?'</DD>

<DD>
'Lady Harriet?' said Molly, suddenly enlightened by the word 'condescending.'</DD>

<DD>
'Yes. Why, how did you guess it? But, after all, her call, at any rate
in the first instance, was upon you. Oh dear, Molly! if you're not in a
hurry to go to bed, let me sit down quietly and tell you all about it;
for my heart jumps into my mouth still when I think of how I was caught.
She - that is, her ladyship - left the carriage at the "George," and took
to her feet to go shopping - just as you or I may have done many a time
in our lives. And sister was taking her forty winks; and I was sitting
with my gown up above my knees and my feet on the fender, pulling out my
grandmother's lace which I'd been washing. The worst has yet to be told.
I'd taken off my cap, for I thought it was getting dusk and no one would
come, and there was I in my black silk skull-cap, when Nancy put her head
in, and whispered, "There's a lady downstairs - a real grand one, by her
talk;" and in there came my Lady Harriet, so sweet and pretty in her ways,
it was some time before I remembered I had never a cap on. Sister never
wakened; or never roused up, so to say. She says she thought it was Nancy
bringing in the tea when she heard some one moving; for her ladyship, as
soon as she saw the state of the case, came and knelt down on the rug by
me, and begged my pardon so prettily for having followed Nancy upstairs
without waiting for permission; and was so taken by my old lace, and wanted
to know how I washed it, and where you were, and when you'd be back, and
when the happy couple would be back: till sister wakened - she's always
a little bit put out, you know, when she first wakens from her afternoon
nap, - and, without turning her head to see who it was, she said, quite
sharp, - "Buzz, buzz, buzz! When will you learn that whispering is more
fidgeting than talking out loud? I've not been able to sleep at all for
the chatter you and Nancy have been keeping up all this time." You know
that was a little fancy of sister's, for she'd been snoring away as naturally
as could be. So I went to her, and leant over her, and said, in a low voice,
-</DD>

<DD>
'"Sister, it's her ladyship and me that has been conversing.'</DD>

<DD>
'"Ladyship here, ladyship there! have you lost your wits, Phoebe, that
you talk such nonsense - and in your skull-cap, too!"</DD>

<DD>
'By this time she was sitting up, and, looking round her, she saw Lady
Harriet, in her velvets and silks, sitting on our rug, smiling, her bonnet
off, and her pretty hair all bright with the blaze of the fire. My word!
Sister was up on her feet directly; and she dropped her curtsey, and made
her excuses for sleeping, as fast as might be, while I went off to put
on my best cap, for sister might well say I was out of my wits to go on
chatting to an earl's daughter in an old black silk skull-cap. Black silk,
too! when, if I'd only known she was coming, I might have put on my new
brown silk one, lying idle in my top drawer. And when I came back, sister
was ordering tea for her ladyship, - our tea, I mean. So I took my turn
at talk, and sister slipped out to put on her Sunday silk. But I don't
think we were quite so much at our case with her ladyship as when I sate
pulling out my lace in my skull-cap. And she was quite struck with our
tea, and asked where we got it, for she had never tasted any like it before;
and I told her we gave only 3<I>s</I>. 4<I>d</I>. a pound for it, at Johnson's
- (sister says I ought to have told her the price of our company-tea, which
is 5<I>s</I>. a pound, only that was not what we were drinking; for, as
ill-luck would have it, we'd none of it in the house) - and she said she
would send us some of hers, all the way from Russia or Prussia, or some
out-of-the-way place, and we were to compare and see which we liked best;
and if we liked hers best, she could get it for us at 3<I>s</I>. a pound.
And she left her love for you; and, though she was going away, you were
not to forget her. Sister thought such a message would set you up too much,
and told me she would not be chargeable for the giving it you. "But," I
said, "a message is a message, and it's on Molly's own shoulders if she's
set up by it. Let us show her an example of humility, sister, though we
have been sitting cheek-by-jowl in such company." So sister humphed, and
said she'd a headache, and went to bed. And now you may tell me your news,
my dear.'</DD>

<DD>
So Molly told her small events; which, interesting as they might have been
at other times to the gossip-loving and sympathetic Miss Phoebe, were rather
pale in the stronger light reflected from the visit of an earl's daughter.</DD>
