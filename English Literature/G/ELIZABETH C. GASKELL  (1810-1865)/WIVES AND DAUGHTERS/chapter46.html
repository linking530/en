<P>'MY dear Molly, why didn't you come and dine with us? I said to sister
I would come and scold you well. Oh, Mr Osborne Hamley, is that you?' and
a look of mistaken intelligence at the t&ecirc;te-?t&ecirc;te she had disturbed
came so perceptibly over Miss Phoebe's face that Mollyrus caught Osborne's
sympathetic eye, and both smiled at the notion.

<P>'I'm sure I - well! one must sometimes - I see our dinner would have
been - ' Then she recovered herself into a connected sentence. 'We only
just heard of Mrs Gibson's having a fly from the "George," because sister
sent our Nancy to pay for a couple of rabbits Tom Ostler had snared (I
hope we shan't be taken up for poachers, Mr Osborne - snaring doesn't require
a licence, I believe?), and she heard he was gone off with the fly to the
Towers with your dear mamma; for Coxe who drives the fly in general has
sprained his ankle. We had just finished dinner, but when Nancy said Tom
Ostler would not be back till night I said, "Why, there's that poor dear
girl left all alone by herself, and her mother such a friend of ours,"
- when she was alive, I mean, But I'm sure I'm glad I'm mistaken.'

<P>Osborne said, - 'I came to speak to Mr Gibson, not knowing he had gone
to London, and Miss Gibson kindly gave me some of her lunch. I must go
now.'

<P>'Oh dear! I am so sorry,' fluttered out Miss Phoebe, 'I disturbed you;
but it was with the best intentions. I always was mal-&agrave;propos from
a child.' But Osborne was gone before she had finished her apologies. Before
he left, his eyes met Molly's with a strange look of yearning farewell
that struck her at the time, and that she remembered strongly afterwards.
'Such a nice suitable thing, and I came in the midst, and spoilt it all.
I am sure you're very kind, my dear, considering - ' t

<P>'Considering what, my dear Miss Phoebe? If you are conjecturing a love
affair between Mr Osborne Hamley and me, you never were more mistaken in
your life. I think I told you so once before. Please do believe me.'

<P>'Oh, yes! I remember. And somehow sister got it into her head it was
Mr Preston, I recollect.'

<P>'One guess is just as wrong as the other,' said Molly, smiling, and
trying to look perfectly indifferent, but going extremely red from annoyance
at the mention of Mr Preston's name. It was very difficult for her to keep
up any conversation, for her heart was full of Osborne - his changed appearance,
his melancholy words of foreboding, and his confidences about his wife
- French, Catholic, servant. Molly could not help trying to piece these
strange facts together by imaginations of her own, and found it very hard
work to attend to kind Miss Phoebe's unceasing patter. She came up to the
point, however, when the voice ceased; and could recall, in a mechanical
manner, the echo of the last words, which from both Miss Phoebe's look,
and the dying accent that lingered in Molly's ear, she perceived to be
a question. Miss Phoebe was asking her if she would go out with her? She
was going to Grinstead's, the bookseller of Hollingford; who, in addition
to his regular business, was the agent for the Hollingford Book Society,
received their subscriptions, kept their accounts, ordered their books
from London, and, on payment of a small salary, allowed the Society to
keep their volumes on shelves in his shop. It was the centre of news and
gossip, the club, as it were, of the little town. Everybody who pretended
to gentility in the place belonged to it, It was a test of gentility, indeed,
rather than of education or a love of literature. No shopkeeper would have
thought of offering himself as a member, however great his general intelligence
and love of reading; while it boasted upon the list of subscribers most
of the county families in the neighbourhood, some of whom subscribed to
the Hollingford Book Society as a sort of duty belonging to their station,
without often using their privilege of reading the books: while there were
residents in the little town, such as Mrs Goodenough, who privately thought
reading a great waste of time, that might be much better employed in sewing,
and knitting, and pastry-making, but who nevertheless belonged to it as
a mark of station, just as these good, motherly women would have thought
it a terrible come-down in the world if they had not had a pretty young
servant-maid to fetch them home from the tea-parties at night. At any rate,
Grinstead's was a very convenient place for a lounge. In that view of the
Book Society every one agreed. Molly went upstairs to get ready to accompany
Miss Phoebe; and on opening one of her drawers she saw Cynthia's envelope,
containing the notes she owed to Mr Preston, carefully sealed up like a
letter. This was what Molly had so unwillingly promised to deliver - the
last final stroke to the affair. Molly took it up, hating it. For a time
she had forgotten it; and now it was here, facing her, and she must try
and get rid of it. She put it into her pocket for the chances of the walk
and the day, and fortune for once seemed to befriend her; for, on their
entering Grinstead's shop, in which two or three people were now, as always,
congregated, making play of examining the books, or business of writing
down the titles of new works in the order-book, there was Mr Preston. He
bowed as they came in. He could not help that; but, at the sight of Molly,
he looked as ill-tempered and out of humour as a man well could do. She
was connected in his mind with defeat and mortification; and besides, the
sight of her called up what he desired now above all things to forget;
namely, the deep conviction received through Molly's simple earnestness,
of Cynthia's dislike to him, If Miss Phoebe had seen the scowl upon his
handsome face, she might have undeceived her sister in her suppositions
about him and Molly. But Miss Phoebe, who did not consider it quite maidenly
to go and stand close to Mr Preston, and survey the shelves of books in
such close proximity to a gentleman, found herself an errand at the other
end of the shop, and occupied herself in buying writing-paper. Molly fingered
her valuable letter, as it lay in her pocket; did she dare to cross over
to Mr Preston, and give it to him, or not? While she was still undecided,
shrinking always just at the moment when she thought she had got her courage
up for action, Miss Phoebe, having finished her purchase, turned round,
and after looking a little pathetically at Mr Preston's back, said to Molly
in a whisper, - 'I think we'll go to Johnson's now, and come back for the
books in a little while.' So across the street to Johnson's they went;
but no sooner had they entered the draper's shop, than Molly's conscience
smote her for her cowardice, and loss of a good opportunity. 'I'll be back
directly,' said she, as soon as Miss Phoebe was engaged with her purchases;
and Molly ran across to Grinstead's, without looking either to the right
or the left; she had been watching the door, and she knew that no Mr Preston
had issued forth. She ran in; he was at the counter now, talking to Grinstead
himself, Molly put the letter into his hand, to his surprise, and almost
against his will, and turned round to go back to Miss Phoebe. At the door
of the shop stood Mrs Goodenough, arrested in the act of entering, staring,
with her round eyes, made still rounder and more owl-like by spectacles,
to see Molly Gibson giving Mr Preston a letter, which he, conscious of
being watched, and favouring underhand practices habitually, put quickly
into his pocket, unopened. Perhaps, if he had had time for reflection he
would not have scrupled to put Molly to open shame, by rejecting what she
so eagerly forced upon him.

<P>There was another long evening to be got through with Mrs Gibson; but
on this occasion there was the pleasant occupation of dinner, which took
up at least an hour; for it was one of Mrs Gibson's fancies - one which
Molly chafed against - to have every ceremonial gone through in the same
stately manner for two as for twenty. So, although Molly knew full well,
and her stepmother knew full well, and Maria knew full well, that neither
Mrs Gibson nor Molly touched dessert, it was set on the table with as much
form as if Cynthia had been at home, who delighted in almonds and raisins;
or Mr Gibson been there, who never could resist dates, although he always
protested against 'persons in their station of life having a formal dessert
set out before them every day.'

<P>And Mrs Gibson herself apologized as it were to Molly to-day, in the
same words she had often used to Mr Gibson, - 'It's no extravagance, for
we need not eat it - I never do. But it looks well, and makes Maria understand
what is required in the daily life of every family of position.'

<P>All through the evening Molly's thoughts wandered far and wide, though
she managed to keep up a show of attention to what Mrs Gibson was saying.
She was thinking of Osborne, and his abrupt, half-finished confidence,
his ill-looks; she was wondering when Roger would come home, and longing
for his return, as much (she said to herself) for Osborne's sake as for
her own. And then she checked herself. What had she to do with Roger? Why
should she long for his return? It was Cynthia who was doing this; only
somehow he was such a true friend to Molly, that she could not help thinking
of him as a staff and a stay in the troublous times which appeared to lie
not far ahead this evening. Then Mr Preston and her little adventure with
him came uppermost. How angry he looked! How could Cynthia have liked him
even enough to get into this abominable scrape, which was, however, all
over now! And so she ran on in her fancies and imaginations, little dreaming
that that very night much talk was going on not half-a-mile from where
she sate sewing, that would prove that the 'scrape' (as she called it,
in her girlish phraseology) was not all over.

<P>Scandal sleeps in the summer, comparatively speaking. Its nature is
the reverse of that of the dormouse. Warm ambient air, loiterings abroad,
gardenings, flowers to talk about, and preserves to make, soothed the wicked
imp to slumber in the parish of Hollingford in summer-time. But when evenings
grew short, and people gathered round the fires, and put their feet in
a circle - not on the fenders, that was not allowed - then was the time
for confidential conversation! Or in the pauses allowed for the tea-trays
to circulate among the card-tables - when those who were peaceably inclined
tried to stop the warm discussions about 'the odd trick,' and the rather
wearisome feminine way of 'shouldering the crutch, and showing how fields
were won' - small crumbs and scraps of daily news came up to the surface,
such as 'Martindale has raised the price of his best joints a halfpenny
in the pound;' or 'it's a shame of Sir Harry to order in another book on
farriery into the Book Society; Phoebe and I tried to read it, but really
there is no general interest in it;' or, 'I wonder what Mr Ashton will
do, now Nancy is going to be married! Why, she has been with him these
seventeen years! It's a very foolish thing for a woman of her age to be
thinking of matrimony; and so I told her, when I met her in the market-place
this morning!'

<P>So said Miss Browning on the night in question; her hand of cards lying
by her on the green baize-covered table, while she munched the rich pound-cake
of a certain Mrs Dawes, lately come to inhabit Hollingford.

<P>'Matrimony's not so bad as you think for, Miss Browning,' said Mrs Goodenough,
standing up for the holy estate into which she had twice entered. 'If I
had ha' seen Nancy, I should ha' given her my mind very different. It's
a great thing to be able to settle what you'll have for dinner, without
never a one interfering with you.'

<P>'If that's all!' said Miss Browning, drawing herself up, 'I can do that;
and, perhaps, better than a woman who has a husband to please.'

<P>'No one can say as I didn't please my husbands - both on 'em, though
Jeremy was tickler' in his tastes than poor Harry Beaver. But as I used
to say to 'em, "Leave the victual to me; it's better for you than knowing
what's to come beforehand. The stomach likes to be taken by surprise."
And neither of 'em ever repented 'em of their confidence. You may take
my word for it, beans and bacon will taste better (and Mr Ashton's Nancy
in her own house) than all the sweetbreads and spring chickens she's been
a-doing for him this seventeen years. But if I chose I could tell you of
something as would interest you all a deal more than old Nancy's marriage
to a widower with nine children - only as the young folks themselves is
meeting in private, clandestine-like, it's perhaps not for me to tell their
secrets.'

<P>'I'm sure I don't want to hear of clandestine meetings between young
men and young women,' said Miss Browning, throwing up her head. 'It's disgrace
enough to the people themselves, I consider, if they enter on a love affair
without the proper sanction of parents. I know 'public opinion has changed
on the subject; but when poor Gratia was married to Mr Byerley, he wrote
to my father without ever having so much as paid her a compliment, or said
more than the most trivial and commonplace things to her; and my father
and mother sent for her into my father's study, and she said she never
was so much frightened in her life, - and they said it was a very good
offer, and Mr Byerley was a very worthy man, and they hoped she would behave
properly to him when he came to supper that night. And after that he was
allowed to come twice a week till they were married. My mother and I sate
at our work in the bow-window of the Rectory drawing-room, and Gratia and
Mr Byerley at the other end; and my mother always called my attention to
some flower or plant in the garden when it struck nine, for that was his
time for going. Without offence to the present company, I am rather inclined
to look upon matrimony as a weakness to which some very worthy people are
prone; but if they must be married, let them make the best of it, and go
through the affair with dignity and propriety; or if there are misdoings
and clandestine meetings, and such things, at any rate, never let me hear
about them! I think it's you to play, Mrs Dawes. You'll excuse my frankness
on the subject of matrimony! Mrs Goodenough there can tell you I'm a very
out-spoken person.'

<P>'It's not the out-speaking, it's what you say that goes against me,
Miss Browning,' said Mrs Goodenough, affronted, yet ready to play her card
as soon as needed, And as for Mrs Dawes, she was too anxious to get into
the genteelest of all (Hollingford) society to object to whatever Miss
Browning (who, in right of being a deceased rector's daughter, rather represented
the selectest circle of the little town) advocated, celibacy, marriage,
bigamy, or polygamy.

<P>So the remainder of the evening passed over without any farther reference
to the secret Mrs Goodenough was burning to disclose, unless a remark made
&agrave;propos de rien by Miss Browning, during the silence of a deal,
could be supposed to have connexiong with the previous conversation. She
said suddenly and abruptly, -

<P>'I don't know what I have done that any man should make me his slave.'
If she was referring to any prospect of matrimonial danger she saw opening
before her fancy, she might have been comforted. But it was a remark of
which no one took any notice, all being far too much engaged in the rubber.
Only when Miss Browning took her early leave (for Miss Phoebe had a cold,
and was an invalid at home), Mrs Goodenough burst out with, -

<P>'Well! now I may speak out my mind, and say as how if there was a slave
between us two, when Goodenough was alive, it wasn't me; and I don't think
as it was pretty in Miss Browning to give herself such airs on her virginity
when there was four widows in the room, - who've had six honest men among
'em for husbands. No offence, Miss Airy!' addressing an unfortunate little
spinster, who found herself the sole representative of celibacy now that
Miss Browning was gone. 'I could tell her of a girl as she's very fond
on, who's on the high road to matrimony; and in as cunning a way as ever
I heerd on. going out at dusk to meet her sweetheart, just as if she was
my Sally, or your Jenny. And her name is Molly too, - which, as I have
often thought, shows a low taste in them as first called her so;' she might
as well be a scullery-maid at oncest. Not that she's picked up anybody
common; she's looked about her for a handsome fellow, and a smart young
man enough!'

<P>Every one around the table looked curious and intent on the disclosures
being made, except the hostess, Mrs Dawes, who smiled intelligence with
her eyes, and knowingly pursed up her mouth until Mrs Goodenough had finished
her tale. Then she said demurely, -

<P>'I suppose you mean Mr Preston and Miss Gibson?'

<P>'Why, who told you?' said Mrs Goodenough, turning round upon her in
surprise. 'You can't say as I did. There's many a Molly in Hollingford,
besides her, - though none, perhaps, in such a genteel station in life.
I never named her, I'm sure.'

<P>'No! But I know. I could tell my tale too,' continued Mrs Dawes.

<P>'No! could you, really?' said Mrs Goodenough, very curious and a little
jealous.

<P>'Yes. My uncle Sheepshanks came upon them in the Park Avenue, - he startled
'em a good deal, he said; and when he taxed Mr Preston with being with
his sweetheart, he didn't deny it.'

<P>'Well! Now so much has come out, I'll tell you what I know. Only, ladies,
I wouldn't wish to do the girl an unkind turn, - so you must keep what
I've got to tell you a secret.' Of course they promised; that was easy.

<P>'My Hannah, as married Tom Oakes, and lives in Pearson's Lane, was a-gathering
of damsons only about a week ago, and Molly Gibson was a-walking fast down
the lane, - quite in a hurry like to meet some one, - and Hannah's little
Anna-Maria fell down, and Molly (who's a kind-hearted lass enough) picked
her up; so if Hannah had had her doubts before, she had none then.'

<P>'But there was no one with her, was there?' asked one of the ladies
anxiously, as Mrs Goodenough stopped to finish her piece of cake, just
at this crisis.

<P>'No: I said she looked as if she was going to meet some one, - and by-and-by
comes Mr Preston running out of the wood just beyond Hannah's, and says
he, "A cup of water, please, good woman, for a lady has fainted, or is
'sterical or something." Now though he didn't know Hannah, Hannah knew
him. "More folks know Tom Fool, than Tom Fool knows," asking Mr Preston's
pardon; for he's no fool whatever he be. And I could tell you more, - and
what I've seed with my own eyes. I seed her give him a letter in Grinstead's
shop, only yesterday, and he looked as black as thunder at her, for he
seed me if she didn't.'

<P>'It's a very suitable kind of thing,' said Miss Airy; 'why do they make
such a mystery of it?'

<P>'Some folks like it,' said Mrs Dawes; 'it adds zest to it all, to do
their courting underhand.'

<P>'Ay, it's like salt to their victual,' put in Mrs Goodenough. But I
didn't think Molly Gibson was one of that sort, I didn't.'

<P>'The Gibsons hold themselves very high?' cried Mrs Dawes, more as an
inquiry than an assertion. 'Mrs Gibson has called upon me.'

<P>'Ay, you're like to be a patient of the doctor's,' put in Mrs Goodenough.

<P>'She seemed to me very affable, though she is so intimate with the Countess
and the family at the Towers; and is quite the lady herself; dines late,
I've heard, and everything in style.'

<P>'Style! very different style to what Bob Gibson, her husband, was used
to when first he came here, - glad of a mutton-chop in his surgery, for
I doubt if he'd a fire anywhere else; we called him Bob Gibson then, but
none on us dare Bob him now; I'd as soon think o' calling him sweep!'

<P>'I think it looks very bad for Miss Gibson!' said one lady, rather anxious
to bring back the conversation to the more interesting present time. But
as soon as Mrs Goodenough heard this natural comment on the disclosures
she had made, she fired round on the speaker.

<P>'Not at all bad, and I'll trouble you not to use such a word as that
about Molly Gibson, as I've known all her life. It's odd, if you will.
I was odd myself as a girl; I never could abide a plate of gathered gooseberries,
but I must needs go and skulk behind a bush and gather 'em for myself.
It's some folk's taste, though it mayn't be Miss Browning's, who'd have
all the courting done under the nose of the family. All as ever I said
was that I was surprised at it in Molly Gibson; and that I'd ha' thought
it was liker that pretty minx of a Cynthia as they call her; indeed at
one time I was ready to swear as it was her Mr Preston was after. And now,
ladies, I'll wish you a very good night. I cannot abide waste; and I'll
venture for it Sally's letting the candle in the lantern run all to grease,
instead of putting it out, as I've told her to do, if ever she's got to
wait for me.'

<P>So with formal dipping curtseys the ladies separated, but not without
thanking Mrs Dawes for the pleasant evening they had had; a piece of old-fashioned
courtesy always gone through in those days.
