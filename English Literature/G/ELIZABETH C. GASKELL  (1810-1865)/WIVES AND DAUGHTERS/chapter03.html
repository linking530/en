<DD>
Sixteen years before this time, all Hollingford had been disturbed to its
foundations by the intelligence that Mr Hall, the skilful doctor, who had
attended them all their days, was going to take a partner. It was no use
reasoning to them on the subject; so Mr Browning the vicar, Mr Sheepshanks
(Lord Cumnor's agent), and Mr Hall himself, the masculine reasoners of
the little society, left off the attempt, feeling that the <I>Che sara
sara</I> would prove more silencing to the murmurs than many arguments.
Mr Hall had told his faithful patients that, even with the strongest spectacles,
his sight was not to be depended upon; and they might have found out for
themselves that his hearing was very defective, although, on this point,
he obstinately adhered to his own opinion, and was frequently heard to
regret the carelessness of people's communication nowadays, 'like writing
on blotting-paper, all the words running into each other,' he would say.
And more than once Mr Hall had had attacks of a suspicious nature, - 'rheumatism'
he used to call them; but he prescribed for himself as if they had been
gout, - which had prevented his immediate attention to imperative summonses.
But, blind and deaf, and rheumatic as he might be, he was still Mr Hall,
the doctor who could heal all their ailments - unless they died meanwhile
- and he had no right to speak of growing old, and taking a partner.</DD>

<DD>
He went very steadily to work all the same; advertising in medical journals,
reading testimonials, sifting character and qualifications; and just when
the elderly maiden ladies of Hollingford thought that they had convinced
their contemporary that he was as young as ever, he startled them by bringing
his new partner, Mr Gibson, to call upon them, and began 'slyly,' as these
ladies said, to introduce him into practice. And 'who was this Mr Gibson?'
they asked, and echo might answer the question, if she liked, for no one
else did. No one ever in all his life knew anything more of his antecedents
than the Hollingford people might have found out the first day they saw
him: that he was tall, grave, rather handsome than otherwise; thin enough
to be called 'a very genteel figure,' in those days, before muscular Christianity
had come into vogue; speaking with a slight Scotch accent; and, as one
good lady observed, 'so very trite in his conversation,' by which she meant
sarcastic. As to his birth, parentage, and education, - the favourite conjecture
of Hollingford society was, that he was the illegitimate son of a Scotch
duke, by a Frenchwoman; and the grounds for this conjecture were these:
- He spoke with a Scotch accent; therefore, he must be Scotch. He had a
very genteel appearance, an elegant figure, and was apt - so his ill-wishers
said - to give himself airs. Therefore, his father must have been some
person of quality; and, that granted, nothing was easier than to run this
supposition up all the notes of the scale of the peerage, - baronet, baron,
viscount, earl, marquis, duke. Higher they dared not go, though one old
lady, acquainted with English history, hazarded the remark, that 'she believed
that one or two of the Stuarts - hem - had not always been, - ahem - quite
correct in their - conduct; and she fancied such - ahem - things ran in
families.' But, in popular opinion, Mr Gibson's father always remained
a duke; nothing more.</DD>

<DD>
Then his mother must have been a Frenchwoman, because his hair was so black;
and he was so sallow; and because he had been in Paris. All this might
be true, or might not; nobody ever knew, or found out anything more about
him than what Mr Hall told them, namely, that his professional qualifications
were as high as his moral character, and that both were far above the average,
as Mr Hall had taken pains to ascertain before introducing him to his patients.
The popularity of this world is as transient as its glory, as Mr Hall found
out before the first year of his partnership was over. He had plenty of
leisure left to him now to nurse his gout and cherish his eyesight. The
younger doctor had carried the day; nearly every one sent for Mr Gibson
now; even at the great houses - even at the Towers, that greatest of all,
where Mr Hall had introduced his new partner with fear and trembling, with
untold anxiety as to his behaviour, and the impression he might make on
my lord the Earl, and MY lady the Countess. Mr Gibson was received at the
end of a twelvemonth with as much welcome respect for his professional
skill as Mr Hall himself had ever been. Nay - and this was a little too
much for even the kind old doctor's good temper - Mr Gibson had even been
invited once to dinner at the Towers, to dine with the great Sir Astley,
the head of the profession! To be sure, Mr Hall had been asked as well;
but he was laid up just then with his gout (since he had had a partner
the rheumatism had been allowed to develop itself, and he had not been
able to go. Poor Mr Hall never quite got over this mortification; after
it he allowed himself to become dim of sight and hard of hearing, and kept
pretty closely to the house during the two winters that remained of his
life. He sent for an orphan grand-niece to keep him company in his old
age; he, the woman-contemning old bachelor, became thankful for the cheerful
presence of the pretty, bonny Mary Preston, who was good and sensible,
and nothing more. She formed a close friendship with the daughters<!--daughters-->
of the vicar, Mr Browning, and Mr Gibson found time to become very intimate
with all three. Hollingford speculated much on which young lady would become
Mrs Gibson, and was rather sorry when the talk about possibilities, and
the gossip about probabilities with regard to the handsome young surgeon's
marriage, ended in the most natural manner in the world, by his marrying
his predecessor's niece. The two Miss Brownings showed no signs of going
into a consumption on the occasion, although their looks and manners were
carefully watched. On the contrary, they were rather boisterously merry
at the wedding, and poor Mrs Gibson it was that died of consumption, four
or five years after her marriage - three years after the death of her great-uncle,
and when her only child, Molly, was just three years old.</DD>

<DD>
Mr Gibson did not speak much about the grief at the loss of his wife, which
it is to be supposed that he felt. Indeed, he avoided all demonstration
of sympathy, and got up hastily and left the room when Miss Phoebe Browning
first saw him after his loss, and burst into an uncontrollable flood of
tears, which threatened to end in hysterics. Miss Browning afterwards said
she never could forgive him for his hard-heartedness on that occasion;
but a fortnight afterwards she came to very high words with old Mrs Goodenough,
for gasping out her doubts whether Mr Gibson was a man of deep feeling;
judging by the narrowness of his crape hat-band, which ought to have covered
his hat, whereas there was at least three inches of beaver to be seen.
And, in spite of it all, Miss Browning and Miss Phoebe considered themselves
as Mr Gibson's most intimate friends, in right of their regard for his
dead wife, and would fain have taken a quasi-motherly interest in his little
girl, had she not been guarded by a watchful dragon in the shape of Betty,
her nurse, who was jealous of any interference between her and her charge;
and especially resentful and disagreeable towards all those ladies who,
by suitable age, rank, or propinquity, she thought capable of 'casting
sheep's eyes at master.'</DD>

<DD>
Several years before the opening of this story, Mr Gibson's position seemed
settled for life, both socially and professionally. He was a widower, and
likely to remain so; his domestic affections were centred on little Molly,
but even to her, in their most private moments, he did not give way to
much expression of his feelings; his most caressing appellation for her
was 'Goosey,' and he took a pleasure in bewildering her infant mind with
his badinage. He had rather a contempt for demonstrative people, arising
from his medical insight into the consequences to health of uncontrolled
feeling. He deceived himself into believing that still his reason was lord
of all, because he had never fallen into the habit of expression on any
other than purely intellectual subjects. Molly, however, had her own intuitions
to guide her. Though her papa laughed at her, quizzed her, joked at her,
in a way which the Miss Brownings called 'really cruel' to each other when
they were quite alone, Molly took her little griefs and pleasures, and
poured them into her papa's ears, sooner even than into Betty's, that kind-hearted
termagant. The child grew to understand her father well, and the two had
the most delightful intercourse together - half banter, half seriousness,
but altogether confidential friendship. Mr Gibson kept three servants;
Betty, a cook, and a girl who was supposed to be housemaid, but who was
under both the elder two, and had a pretty life of it in consequence. Three
servants would not have been required if it had not been Mr Gibson's habit,
as it had been Mr Hall's before him, to take two 'pupils,' as they were
called in the genteel language of Hollingford, (apprentices,' as they were
in fact - being bound by indentures, and paying a handsome premium' to
learn their business. They lived in the house, and occupied an uncomfortable,
ambiguous, or, as Miss Browning called it with some truth, 'amphibious'
position. They had their meals with Mr Gibson and Molly, and were felt
to be terribly in the way; Mr Gibson not being a man who could make conversation,
and hating the duty of talking under restraint. Yet something within him
made him wince, as if his duties were not rightly performed, when, as the
cloth was drawn, the two awkward lads rose up with joyful alacrity, gave
him a nod, which was to be interpreted as a bow, knocked against each other
in their endeavours to get out of the dining-room quickly; and then might
be heard dashing along a passage which led to the surgery, choking with
half-suppressed laughter. Yet the annoyance he felt at this dull sense
of imperfectly fulfilled duties only made his sarcasms on their inefficiency,
or stupidity, or ill manners, more bitter than before.</DD>

<DD>
Beyond direct professional instruction, he did not know what to do with
the succession of pairs of young men, whose mission seemed to be to plague
their master consciously, and to plague him unconsciously. Once or twice
Mr Gibson had declined taking a fresh pupil, in the hopes of shaking himself
free from the incubus, but his reputation as a clever surgeon had spread
so rapidly that fees which he had thought prohibitory, were willingly paid,
in order that the young man might make a start in life, with the prestige
of having been a pupil of Gibson of Hollingford. But as Molly grew to be
a little girl instead of a child, when she was about eight years old, her
father perceived the awkwardness of her having her breakfasts and dinners
so often alone with the pupils, without his uncertain presence. To do away
with this evil, more than for the actual instruction she could give, he
engaged a respectable woman, the daughter of a shopkeeper in the town,
who had left a destitute family, to come every morning before breakfast,
and to stay with Molly till he came home at night; or, if he was detained,
until the child's bedtime.</DD>

<DD>
'Now, Miss Eyre,' said he, summing up his instructions the day before she
entered upon her office, 'remember this: you are to make good tea for the
young men, and see that they have their meals comfortably, and - you are
five-and-thirty, I think you said? - try and make them talk, - rationally,
I am afraid is beyond your or anybody's power; but make them talk without
stammering or giggling. Don't teach Molly too much: she must sew, and read,
and write, and do her sums; but I want to keep her a child, and if I find
more learning desirable for her, I'll see about giving it to her myself.
After all, I am not sure that reading or writing is necessary. Many a good
woman gets married with only a cross instead of her name; it's rather a
diluting of mother-wit, to my fancy; but, however we must yield to the
prejudices of society, Miss Eyre, and so you may teach the child to read.'</DD>

<DD>
Miss Eyre listened in silence, perplexed but determined to be obedient
to the directions of the doctor, whose kindness she and her family had
good cause to know. She made strong tea; she helped the young men liberally
in Mr Gibson's absence, as well as in his presence, and she found the way
to unloosen their tongues, whenever their master was away, by talking to
them on trivial subjects in her pleasant homely way. She taught Molly to
read and write, but tried honestly to keep her back in every other branch
of education. It was only by fighting and struggling hard, that bit by
bit Molly persuaded her father to let her have French and drawing lessons.
He was always afraid of her becoming too much educated, though he need
not have been alarmed; the masters who visited such small country towns
as Hollingford forty years ago, were no such great proficients in their
arts. Once a week she joined a dancing class in the assembly-room at the
principal inn in the town: the 'George;' and, being daunted by her father
in every intellectual attempt, she read every book that came in her way,
almost with as much delight as if it had been forbidden. For his station
in life, Mr Gibson had an unusually good library; the medical portion of
it was inaccessible to Molly, being kept in the surgery, but every other
book she had either read, or tried to read. Her summer place of study was
that seat in the cherry-tree, where she got the green stains on her frock,
that have already been mentioned as likely to wear Betty's life out. In
spite of this 'hidden worm i' th' bud,' Betty was to all appearance strong,
alert, and flourishing. She was the one crook in Miss Eyre's lot, who was
otherwise so happy in having met with a suitable well-paid employment just
when she needed it most. But Betty, though agreeing in theory with her
master when he told her of the necessity of having a governess for his
little daughter, was vehemently opposed to any division of her authority
and influence over the child who had been her charge, her plague, and her
delight ever since Mrs Gibson's death. She took up her position as censor
of all Miss Eyre's sayings and doings from the very first, and did not
for a moment condescend to conceal her disapprobation. In her heart, she
could not help respecting the patience and painstaking of the good lady,
- for a 'lady' Miss Eyre was in the best sense of the word, though in Hollingford
she only took rank as a shopkeeper's daughter. Yet Berry buzzed about her
with the teasing pertinacity of a gnat, always ready to find fault, if
not to bite. Miss Eyre's only defence came from the quarter whence it might
least have been expected - from her pupil; on whose fancied behalf, as
an oppressed little personage, Betty always based her attacks. But very
early in the day Molly perceived their injustice, and soon afterwards she
began to respect Miss Eyre for her silent endurance of what evidently gave
her far more pain than Betty imagined. Mr Gibson had been a friend in need
to her family, so Miss Eyre restrained her complaints, sooner than annoy
him. And she had her reward. Betty would offer Molly all sorts of small
temptations to neglect Miss Eyre's wishes; Molly steadily resisted, and
plodded away at her task of sewing or her difficult sum. Betty made cumbrous
jokes at Miss Eyre's expense. Molly looked up with the utmost gravity,
as if requesting the explanation of an unintelligible speech; and there
is nothing so quenching to a wag as to be asked to translate his jest into
plain matter-of-fact English, and to show wherein the point lies. Occasionally
Berry lost her temper entirely, and spoke impertinently to Miss Eyre; but
when this had been done in Molly's presence, the girl flew out into such
a violent passion of words in defence of her silent trembling governess,
that even Berry herself was daunted, though she chose to take the child's
anger as a good joke, and tried to persuade Miss Eyre herself to join in
her amusement.</DD>

'Bless the child! one would think I was a hungry pussy-cat, and she a hen-sparrow,
with her wings all fluttering, and her little eyes aflame, and her beak
ready to peck me just because I happened to look near her nest. Nay, child!
if thou lik'st to be stifled in a nasty close room, learning things as
is of no earthly good when they is learnt, instead o' riding on Job Donkin's
hay-cart, it's thy look-out, not mine. She's a little vixen, isn't she?'
smiling at Miss Eyre, as she finished her speech. But the poor governess
saw no humour in the affair; the comparison of Molly to a hen-sparrow was
lost upon her. She was sensitive and conscientious, and knew, from home
experience, the evils of an ungovernable temper. So she began to reprove
Molly for giving way to her passion, and the child thought it hard to be
blamed for what she considered her just anger against Betty. But, after
all, these were the small grievances of a very happy childhood,</DD>
