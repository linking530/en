It was a day or two afterwards, that Mr Gibson made time to ride round
by Hamley, desirous to learn more exact particulars of this scheme for
Roger than he could obtain from any extraneous source, and rather puzzled
to know whether he should interfere in the project or not. The state of
the case was this: - Osborne's symptoms were, in Mr Gibson's opinion, signs
of his having a fatal disease. Dr Nicholls had differed from him on this
head, and Mr Gibson knew that the old physician had had long experience,
and was considered very skilful in the profession. Still he believed that
he himself was right, and, if so, the complaint was one which might continue
for years in the same state as at present, or might end the young man's
life in a hour - a minute. Supposing that Mr Gibson was right, would it
be well for Roger to be away where no sudden calls for his presence could
reach him - away for two years? Yet if the affair was concluded, the interference
of a medical man might accelerate the very evil to be feared; and after
all Dr Nicholls might be right, and the symptoms might proceed from some
other cause. Might? Yes. Probably did? No. Mr Gibson could not bring himself
to say yes to this latter form of sentence. So he rode on, meditating;
his reins slack, his head a little bent. It was one of those still and
lovely autumn days when the red and yellow leaves are hanging-pegs to dewy,
brilliant gossamer-webs; when the hedges are full of trailing brambles,
loaded with ripe blackberries; when the air is full of the farewell whistles
and pipes of birds, clear and short - not the long full-throated warbles
of spring; when the whirr of the partridge's wings is heard in the stubble-fields,
as the sharp hoof-blows fall on the paved lanes; when here and there a
leaf floats and flutters down to the ground, although there is not a single
breath of wind. The country surgeon felt the beauty of the seasons perhaps
more than most men. He saw more of it by day, by night, in storm and sunshine,
or in the still, soft, cloudy weather He never spoke about what he felt
on the subject; indeed, he did not put his feelings into words, even to
himself, But if his mood ever approached to the sentimental, it was on
such days as this. He rode into the stable-yard, gave his horse to a man,
and went into the house by a side entrance. In the passage he met the squire.</DD>

<DD>
'That's capital, Gibson! what good wind blew you here? You'll have some
lunch? it's on the table, I only just this minute left the room.' And he
kept shaking Mr Gibson's hand all the time till he had placed him, nothing
loth, at the well-covered dining-table.</DD>

<DD>
'What's this I hear about Roger?' said Mr Gibson, plunging at once into
the subject.</DD>

<DD>
'Aha! so you've heard, have you? It's famous, is it not? He's a boy to
be proud of, is old Roger. Steady Roger; we used to think him slow, but
it seems to me that slow and sure wins the race. But tell me; what have
you heard? how much is known? Nay, you must have a glass full. It's old
ale, such as we don't brew now-a-days; it's as old as Osborne. We brewed
it that autumn and we called it the young squire's ale. I thought to have
tapped it on his marriage, but I don't know when that will come to pass,
so we've tapped it now in Roger's honour.'</DD>

<DD>
The old squire had evidently been enjoying the young squire's ale to the
verge of prudence. It was indeed as he said, (as strong as brandy,' and
Mr Gibson had to sip it very carefully as he ate his cold roast beef.</DD>

<DD>
'Well! and what have you heard? There's a deal to hear, and all good news,
though I shall miss the lad, I know that.'</DD>

<DD>
'I did not know it was settled; I only heard that it was in progress.'</DD>

<DD>
'Well, it was only in progress, as you call it, till last Tuesday. He never
let me know anything about it, though; he says he thought I might be fidgety
with thinking of the pros and cons. So I never knew a word on't till I
had a letter from my Lord Hollingford - where is it?' pulling out a great
black leathern receptacle for all manner of papers. And putting on his
spectacles, he read aloud their headings.</DD>

<DD>
'"Measurement of timber, new railings," "drench for cows, from Farmer Hayes,"
"Dobson's accounts," - 'um 'um - here it is. Now read that letter,' handing
it to Mr Gibson.</DD>

<DD>
It was a manly, feeling, sensible letter, explaining to the old father
in very simple language the services which were demanded by the terms of
the will to which he and two or three others were trustees; the liberal
allowance for expenses, the still more liberal reward for performance,
which had tempted several men of considerable renown to offer themselves
as candidates for the appointment. Lord Hollingford then went on to say
that, having seen a good deal of Roger lately, since the publication of
his article in reply to the French osteologist, he had had reason to think
that in him the trustees would find united the various qualities required
in a greater measure than in any of the applicants who had at that time
presented themselves. Roger had deep interest in the subject; much acquired
knowledge, and at the same time, great natural powers of comparison, and
classification of facts; he had shown' himself to be an observer of a fine
and accurate kind, he was of the right age, in the very prime of health
and strength, and unshackled by any family ties. Here Mr Gibson paused
for consideration. He hardly cared to ascertain by what steps the result
had been arrived at - he already knew what that result was; but his mind
was again arrested as his eye caught on the remuneration offered, which
was indeed most liberal; and then he read with attention the high praise
bestowed on the son in this letter to the father. The squire had been watching
Mr Gibson - waiting till he came to this part - and he rubbed his hands
together as he said, -</DD>

<DD>
'Ay! you've come to it at last. It's the best part of the whole, is it
not? God bless the boy! and from a Whig, mind you, which makes it the more
handsome. And there's more to come still. I say, Gibson, I think my luck
is turning at last,' passing him on yet another letter to read. 'That only
came this morning; but I've acted on it already, I sent for the foreman
of the drainage works at once, I did; and to-morrow, please God, they'll
be at work again.'</DD>

<DD>
Mr Gibson read the second letter, from Roger. To a certain degree it was
a modest repetition of what Lord Hollingford had said, with an explanation
of how he had come to take so decided a step in life without consulting
his father. He did not wish him to be in suspense for one reason. Another
was that he felt, as no one else could feel for him, that by accepting
this offer, he entered upon the kind of life for which he knew himself
to be the most fitted. And then he merged the whole into business. He said
that he knew well the suffering his father had gone through when he had
had to give up his drainage works for want of money; that he, Roger, had
been enabled at once to raise money upon the remuneration he was to receive
on the accomplishment of his two years' work; and that he had insured his
life at once, in order to provide for the repayment of the money he had
raised, in case he did not live to return to England. He said that the
sum he had borrowed on this security would at once be forwarded to his
father.</DD>

<DD>
Mr Gibson laid down the letter without speaking a word for some time; then
he said, -</DD>

<DD>
'He'll have to pay a pretty sum for insuring his life beyond seas.'</DD>

<DD>
'He has got his Fellowship money,' said the squire, a little depressed
at Mr Gibson's remark.</DD>

<DD>
'Yes; that's true. And he's a strong young fellow, as I know.'</DD>

<DD>
'I wish I could tell his mother,' said the squire in an under-tone.</DD>

<DD>
'It seems all settled now,' said Mr Gibson, more in reply to his own thoughts
than to the squire's remark.</DD>

<DD>
'Yes!' said the squire; 'and they're not going to let the grass grow under
his feet. He's to be off as soon as he can get his scientific traps ready.
I almost wish he wasn't to go. You don't seem quite to like it, doctor?'</DD>

<DD>
'Yes I do,' said Mr Gibson in a more cheerful tone than before. 'It can't
be helped now without doing a mischief,' thought he to himself. 'Why, squire,
I think it's a great honour to have such a son. I envy you, that's what
I do. Here's a lad of three or four and twenty distinguishing himself in
more ways than one, and as simple and affectionate at home as any fellow
need to be - not a bit set up.'</DD>

<DD>
'Ay, ay; he's twice as much a son to me as Osborne, who has been all his
life set up on nothing at all, as one may say.</DD>

<DD>
'Come, squire, I must not hear anything against Osborne; we may praise
one, without hitting at the other. Osborne has not had the strong health
which has enabled Roger to work as he has done. I met a man who knew his
tutor at Trinity the other day, and of course we began cracking about Roger
- it's not every day that one can reckon a senior wrangler amongst one's
friends, and I'm nearly as proud of the lad as you are. This Mr Mason told
me the tutor said that only half of Roger's success was owing to his mental
powers; the other half was owing to his perfect health, which enabled him
to work harder and more continuously than most men without suffering. He
said that in all his experience he had never known any one with an equal
capacity for mental labour; and that he could come again with a fresh appetite
to his studies after shorter intervals of rest than most. Now I, being
a doctor, trace a good deal of his superiority to the material cause of
a thoroughly good constitution, which Osborne has not got.'</DD>

<DD>
'Osborne might have if he got out o' doors more,' said the squire, moodily;
'but except when he can loaf into Hollingford he does not care to go out
at all. I hope,' he continued, with a glance of sudden suspicion at Mr
Gibson, 'he's not after one of your girls? I don't mean any offence, you
know; but he'll have the estate, and it won't be free, and he must marry
money. I don't think I could allow it in Roger; but Osborne is the eldest
son, you know.'</DD>

<DD>
Mr Gibson reddened; he was offended for a moment. Then the partial truth
of what the squire said was presented to his mind, and he remembered their
old friendship, so he spoke quietly, if shortly.</DD>

<DD>
'I don't believe there's anything of the kind going on. I'm not much at
home, you know; but I've never heard or seen anything that should make
me suppose that there is. When I do, I'll let you know.'</DD>

<DD>
'Now, Gibson, don't go and be offended. I am glad for the boys to have
a pleasant house to go to, and I thank you and Mrs Gibson for making it
pleasant. Only keep off love; it can come to no good. That's all. I don't
believe Osborne will ever earn a farthing to keep a wife during my life,
and if I were to die to-morrow, she would have to bring some money to clear
the estate. And if I do speak as I should not have done formerly - a little
sharp or so - why, it's because I've been worried by many a care no one
knows anything of.'</DD>

<DD>
'I'm not going to take offence,' said Mr Gibson, 'but let us understand
each other clearly. If you don't want your sons to come as much to my house
as they do, tell them so yourself. I like the lads, and am glad to see
them; but if they do come, you must take the consequences, whatever they
are, and not blame me, or them either, for what may happen from the frequent
intercourse between two young men and two young women; and what is more,
though, as I said, I see nothing whatever of the kind you fear at present,
and have promised to tell you of the first symptoms I do see, yet farther
than that I won't go. If there is an attachment at any future time, I won't
interfere.'</DD>

<DD>
'I should not so much mind if Roger fell in love with your Molly. He can
fight for himself, you see, and she's an uncommon nice girl. My poor wife
was so fond of her,' answered the squire. 'It's Osborne and the estate
I'm thinking of!'</DD>

<DD>
'Well, then, tell him not to come near us. I shall be sorry, but you will
be safe.'</DD>

<DD>
'I'll think about it; but he's difficult to manage. I've always to get
my blood well up before I can speak my mind to him.'</DD>

<DD>
Mr Gibson was leaving the room, but at these words he turned and laid his
hand on the squire's arm.</DD>

<DD>
'Take my advice, squire. As I said, there is no harm done as yet, as far
as I know. Prevention is better than cure. Speak out, but speak gently
to Osborne, and do it at once. I shall understand how it is if he does
not show his face for some months in my house. If you speak gently to him,
he'll take the advice as from a friend. If he can assure you there's no
danger, of course he'll come just as usual, when he likes.'</DD>

<DD>
It was all very fine giving the squire this good advice; but as Osborne
had already formed the very kind of marriage his father most deprecated,
it did not act quite as well as Mr Gibson had hoped. The squire began the
conversation with unusual self-control; but he grew irritated when Osborne
denied his father's right to interfere in any marriage he might contemplate;
denied it with a certain degree of doggedness and weariness of the subject
that drove the squire into one of his passions; and although on after reflection
he remembered that he had his son's promise and solemn word not to think
of either Cynthia or Molly for his wife, yet the father and son had passed
through one of those altercations which help to estrange men for life.
Each had said bitter things to the other; and, if the brotherly affection
had not been so true between Osborne and Roger, they too might have become
alienated, in consequence of the squire's exaggerated and injudicious comparison
of their characters and deeds. But as Roger in his boyhood had loved Osborne
too well to be jealous of the praise and love the eldest son, the beautiful
brilliant lad, had received, to the disparagement of his own plain awkwardness
and slowness, so now Osborne strove against any feeling of envy or jealousy
with all his might; but his efforts were conscious, Roger's had been the
simple consequence of affection, and the end to poor Osborne was that he
became moody and depressed in mind and body; but both father and son concealed
their feelings in Roger's presence. When he came home just before sailing,
busy and happy, the squire caught his infectious energy, and Osborne looked
up and was cheerful.</DD>

<DD>
There was no time to be lost. He was bound to a hot climate, and must take
all advantage possible of the winter months. He was to go first to Paris,
to have interviews with some of the scientific men there. Some of his outfit,
instruments, &amp;c., were to follow him to Havre, from which port he was
to embark, after transacting his business in Paris. The squire, learnt
all his arrangements and plans, and even tried in after-dinner conversations
to penetrate into the questions involved in the researches his son was
about to make. But Roger's visit home could not be prolonged beyond two
days.</DD>

<DD>
The last day he rode into Hollingford earlier than he needed to have done
to catch the London coach, in order to bid the Gibsons good-by. He had
been too actively busy for some time to have leisure to bestow much thought
on Cynthia; but there was no need for fresh meditation on that subject.
Her image as a prize to be worked for, to be served for seven years, and
seven years more,' was safe and sacred in his heart. It was very bad, this
going away, and wishing her good-by for two long years; and he wondered
much during his ride how far he should be justified in telling her mother,
perhaps in telling her own sweet self, what his feelings were without expecting,
nay, indeed reprobating, any answer on her part. Then she would know at
any rate how dearly she was beloved by one who was absent; how in all difficulties
or dangers the thought of her would be a polar star, high up in the heavens,
and so on, and so on; for with all a lover's quickness of imagination and
triteness of fancy, he called her a star, a flower, a nymph, a witch, an
angel, or a mermaid, a nightingale, a siren, as one or another of her attributes
rose up before him.</DD>
