During all the months that had elapsed since Mrs Hamley's death, Molly
had wondered many a time about the secret she had so unwittingly become
possessed of that last day in the Hall library. It seemed so utterly strange
and unheard-of a thing to her inexperienced mind, that a man should be
married, and yet not live with his wife - that a son should have entered
into the holy state of matrimony without his father's knowledge, and without
being recognized as the husband of some one known or unknown by all those
with whom he came in daily contact, that she felt occasionally as if that
little ten minutes of revelation must have been a vision in a dream. Both
Roger and Osborne had kept the most entire silence on the subject ever
since. Not even a look, or a pause, betrayed any allusion to it; it even
seemed to have passed out of their thoughts. There had been the great sad
event of their mother's death to fill their minds on the next occasion
of their meeting Molly; and since then long pauses of intercourse had taken
place; so that she sometimes felt as if each of the brothers must have
forgotten how she had come to know their important secret. She often found
herself entirely forgetting it, but perhaps the consciousness of it was
present to her unawares, and enabled her to comprehend the real nature
of Osborne's feelings towards Cynthia. At any rate she never for a moment
had supposed that his gentle kind manner towards Cynthia was anything but
the courtesy of a friend; strange to say, in these latter days Molly had
looked upon Osborne's relation to herself as pretty much the same as that
in which at one time she had considered Roger's; and she thought of the
former as of some one as nearly a brother both to Cynthia and herself,
as any young man could well be, whom they had not known in childhood, and
who was in nowise related to them. She thought that he was very much improved
in manner, and probably in character, by his mother's death. He was no
longer sarcastic, or fastidious, or vain, or self-confident. She did not
know how often all these styles of talk or of behaviour were put on to
conceal shyness or consciousness, and to veil the real self from strangers.</DD>

<DD>
Osborne's conversation and ways might very possibly have been just the
same as before, had he been thrown amongst new people; but Molly only saw
him in their own circle in which he was on terms of decided intimacy. Still
there was no doubt that he was really improved, though perhaps not to the
extent for which Molly gave him credit; and this exaggeration on her part
arose very naturally from the fact, that he, perceiving Roger's warm admiration
for Cynthia, withdrew a little out of his brother's way; and used to go
and talk to Molly in order not to intrude himself between Roger and Cynthia.
Of the two, perhaps, Osborne preferred Molly; to her he needed not to talk
if the mood was not on him - they were on those happy terms where silence
is permissible, and where efforts to act against the prevailing mood of
the mind are not required. Sometimes, indeed, when Osborne was in the humour
to be critical and fastidious as of yore, he used to vex Roger by insisting
upon it that Molly was prettier than Cynthia.</DD>

<DD>
'You mark my words, Roger. Five years hence the beautiful Cynthia's red
and white will have become just a little coarse, and her figure will have
thickened, while Molly's will only have developed into more perfect grace.
I don't believe the girl has done growing yet; I am sure she is taller
than when I first saw her last summer.'</DD>

<DD>
'Miss Kirkpatrick's eyes must always be perfection. I cannot fancy any
could come up to them: soft, grave, appealing, tender; and such a heavenly
colour - I often try to find something in nature to compare them to; they
are not like violets - that blue in the eyes is too like physical weakness
of sight; they are not like the sky - that colour has something of cruelty
in it.'</DD>

<DD>
'Come, don't go on trying to match her eyes as if you were a draper, and
they a bit of ribbon; say at once "her eyes are loadstars," and have done
with it! I set up Molly's grey eyes and curling black lashes, long odds
above the other young woman's; but, of course, it's all a matter of taste.'</DD>

<DD>
And now both Osborne and Roger had left the neighbourhood. In spite of
all that Mrs Gibson had said about Roger's visits being ill-timed and intrusive,
she began to feel as if they had been a very pleasant variety, now they
had ceased altogether. He brought in a whiff of a new atmosphere from that
of Hollingford. He and his brother had been always ready to do numberless
little things which only a man can do for women; small services which Mr
Gibson was always too busy to render. For the good doctor's business grew
upon him. He thought that this increase was owing to his greater skill
and experience, and he would probably have been mortified if he could have
known how many of his patients were solely biassed in sending for him,
by the fact that he was employed at the Towers. Something of this sort
must have been contemplated in the low scale of payment adopted long ago
by the Cumnor family. Of itself the money he received for going to the
Towers would hardly have paid him for horse-flesh, but then as Lady Cumnor
in her younger days had worded it, -</DD>

<DD>
'It is such a thing for a man just setting up in practice for himself to
be able to say he attends at this house!'</DD>

<DD>
So the prestige was tacitly sold and paid for; but neither buyer nor seller
defined the nature of the bargain. On the whole, it was as well that Mr
Gibson spent so much of his time from home. He sometimes thought so himself
when he heard his wife's plaintive fret or pretty babble over totally indifferent
things, and perceived of how flimsy a nature were all her fine sentiments.
Still, he did not allow himself to repine over the step he had taken; he
wilfully shut his eyes and waxed up his ears to many small things that
he knew would have irritated him if he had attended to them; and, in his
solitary rides, he forced himself to dwell on the positive advantages that
had accrued to him and his through his marriage. He had obtained an unexceptionable
chaperone, if not a tender mother, for his little girl; a skilful manager
of his formerly disorderly household; a woman who was graceful and pleasant
to look at for the head of his table. Moreover, Cynthia reckoned for something
in the favourable side of the balance. She was a capital companion for
Molly; and the two were evidently very fond of each other. The feminine
companionship of the mother and daughter was agreeable to him as well as
to his child, - when Mrs Gibson was moderately sensible and not over-sentimental,
he mentally added; and then he checked himself, for he would not allow
himself to become more aware of her faults and foibles by defining them.
At any rate, she was harmless, and wonderfully just to Molly for a stepmother.
She piqued herself upon this indeed, and would often call attention to
the fact of her being unlike other women in this respect. Just then sudden
tears came into Mr Gibson's eyes, as he remembered how quiet and undemonstrative
his little Molly had become in her general behaviour to him; but how once
or twice, when they had met upon the stairs, or were otherwise unwitnessed,
she had caught him and kissed him - hand or cheek - in a sad passionateness
of affection. But in a moment he began to whistle an old Scotch air he
had heard in his childhood, and which had never recurred to his memory
since; and five minutes afterwards he was too busily treating a case of
white swelling in the knee of a little boy, and thinking how to relieve
the poor mother, who went out charring all day, and had to listen to the
moans of her child all night, to have any thought for his own cares, which,
if they really existed, were of so trifling a nature compared to the hard
reality of this hopeless woe.</DD>

<DD>
Osborne came home first. He returned, in fact, not long after Roger had
gone away; but he was languid and unwell, and, though he did not complain,
he felt unequal to any exertion. Thus a week or more elapsed before any
of the Gibsons knew that he was at the Hall; and then it was only by chance
that they became aware of it. Mr Gibson met him in one of the lanes near
Hamley; the acute surgeon noticed the gait of the man as he came near,
before he recognized who it was. When he overtook him he said, -</DD>

<DD>
'Why, Osborne, is it you? I thought it was an old man of fifty loitering
before me! I didn't know you had come back.'</DD>

<DD>
'Yes,' said Osborne, 'I've been at home nearly ten days. I daresay I ought
to have called on your people, for I made a half promise to Mrs Gibson
to let her know as soon as I returned; but the fact is, I'm feeling very
good-for-nothing, - this air oppresses me; I could hardly breathe in the
house, and yet I'm already tired with this short walk.'</DD>

<DD>
'You'd better get home at once; and I'll call and see you as I come back
from Rowe's.'</DD>

<DD>
'No, you mustn't, on any account!' said Osborne, hastily; my father is
annoyed enough about my going from home, so often, he says, though it was
six weeks. He puts down all my languor to my having been away, - he keeps
the purse-strings, you know,' he added, with a faint smile, 'and I'm in
the unlucky position of a penniless heir, and I've been brought up so -
In fact, I must leave home from time to time, and, if my father gets confirmed
in this notion of his that my health is worse for my absences, he will
stop the supplies altogether.'</DD>

<DD>
'May I ask where you do spend your time when you are not at Hamley Hall?'
asked Mr Gibson, with some hesitation in his manner.</DD>

<DD>
'No!' replied Osborne, reluctantly. 'I will tell you this: - I stay with
friends in the country. I lead a life which ought to be conducive to health,
because it is thoroughly simple, rational, and happy. And now I've told
you more about it than my father himself knows. He never asks me where
I have been; and I shouldn't tell him if he did - at least, I think not.'</DD>

<DD>
Mr Gibson rode on by Osborne's side, not speaking for a moment or two.</DD>

<DD>
'Osborne, whatever scrapes you may have got into, I should advise your
telling your father boldly out. I know him; and I know he'll be angry enough
at first, but he'll come round, take my word for it; and, somehow or another,
he'll find money to pay your debts and set you free, if it's that kind
of difficulty; and if it's any other kind of entanglement, why still he's
your best friend. It's this estrangement from your father that's telling
on your health, I'll be bound.'</DD>

<DD>
'No,' said Osborne, 'I beg your pardon; but it's not that; I am really
out of order. I daresay my unwillingness to encounter any displeasure from
my father is the consequence of my indisposition; but I'll answer for it,
it is not the cause of it. My instinct tells me there is something real
the matter with me.'</DD>

<DD>
'Come, don't be setting up your instinct against the profession,' said
Mr Gibson, cheerily. He dismounted, and throwing the reins of his horse
round his arm, he looked at Osborne's tongue and felt his pulse, asking
him various questions. At the end he said, -</DD>

<DD>
'We'll soon bring you about, though I should like a little more quiet talk
with you, without this tugging brute for a third. If you'll manage to ride
over and lunch with us to-morrow, Dr Nicholls will be with us; he's coming
over to see old Rowe; and you shall have the benefit of the advice of two
doctors instead of one. Go home now, you've had enough exercise for the
middle of a day as hot as this is. And don't mope in the house, listening
to the maunderings of your stupid instinct.'</DD>

<DD>
'What else have I to do?' said Osborne. 'My father and I are not companions;
one can't read and write for ever, especially when there is no end to be
gained by it. I don't mind telling you - but in confidence, recollect -
that I've been trying to get some of my poems published; but there's no
one like a publisher for taking the conceit out of one. Not a man among
them would take them as a gift.'</DD>

<DD>
'0 ho! so that's it, is it, Master Osborne? I thought there was some mental
cause for this depression of health. I wouldn't trouble my head about it,
if I were you, though that's always very easily said, I know. Try your
hand at prose, if you can't manage to please the publishers with poetry;
but, at any rate, don't go on fretting over spilt milk. But I mustn't lose
my time here. Come over to us to-morrow, as I said; and what with the wisdom
of two doctors, and the wit and folly of three women, I think we shall
cheer you up a bit.'</DD>

<DD>
So saying, Mr Gibson remounted, and rode away at the long, slinging trot
so well known to the country people as the doctor's pace.</DD>

<DD>
'I don't like his looks,' thought Mr Gibson to himself at night, as over
his daybooks he reviewed the events of the day. 'And then his pulse. But
how often we're all mistaken; and, ten to one, my own hidden enemy lies
closer to me than his does to him - even taking the worse view of the case.'</DD>

<DD>
Osborne made his appearance a considerable time before luncheon the next
morning; and no one objected to the earliness of his call. He was feeling
better. There were few signs of the invalid about him; and what few there
were disappeared under the bright pleasant influence of such a welcome
as he received from all. Molly and Cynthia had much to tell him of the
small proceedings since he went away, or to relate the conclusions of half-accomplished
projects. Cynthia was often on the point of some gay, careless inquiry
as to where he had been, and what he had been doing; but Molly, who conjectured
the truth, as often interfered to spare him the pain of equivocation -
a pain that her tender conscience would have felt for him, much more than
he would have felt it for himself.</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Gibson's talk was desultory, complimentary, and sentimental, after
her usual fashion; but still, on the whole, though Osborne smiled to himself
at much that she said, it was soothing and agreeable. Presently, Dr Nicholls
and Mr Gibson came in; the former had had some conference with the latter
on the subject of Osborne's health; and, from time to time, the skilful
old physician's sharp and observant eyes gave a comprehensive look at Osborne.</DD>

<DD>
Then there was lunch, when every one was merry and hungry, excepting the
hostess, who was trying to train her midday appetite into the genteelest
of all ways, and thought (falsely enough) that Dr Nicholls was a good person
to practise the semblance of ill-health upon, and that he would give her
the proper civil amount of commiseration for her ailments, which every
guest ought to bestow upon a hostess who complains of her delicacy of health.
The old doctor was too cunning a man to fall into this trap. He would keep
recommending her to try the coarsest viands on the table; and, at last,
he told her if she could not fancy the cold beef to try a little with pickled
onions. There was a twinkle in his eye as he said this, that would have
betrayed his humour to any observer; but Mr Gibson, Cynthia, and Molly
were all attacking Osborne on the subject of some literary preference he
had expressed, and Dr Nicholls had Mrs Gibson quite at his mercy. She was
not sorry when luncheon was over to leave the room to the three gentlemen;
and ever afterwards she spoke of Dr Nicholls as 'that bear.'</DD>

<DD>
Presently, Osborne came upstairs, and, after his old fashion, began to
take up new books, and to question the girls as to their music. Mrs Gibson
had to go out and pay some calls, so she left the three together; and after
a while they adjourned into the garden, Osborne lounging on a chair, while
Molly employed herself busily in tying up carnations, and Cynthia gathered
flowers in her careless, graceful way.</DD>

<DD>
'I hope you notice the difference in our occupations, Mr Hamley. Molly,
you see, devotes herself to the useful, and I to the ornamental. Please,
under what head do you class what you are doing? I think you might help
one of us, instead of looking on like the Grand Seigneur.'</DD>

<DD>
'I don't know what I can do,' said he, rather plaintively. 'I should like
to be useful, but I don't know how; and my day is past for purely ornamental
work. You must let me be, I am afraid. Besides, I am really rather exhausted
by being questioned and pulled about by those good doctors.'</DD>

<DD>
'Why, you don't mean to say they have been attacking you since lunch!'
exclaimed Molly.</DD>

<DD>
'Yes; indeed, they have; and they might have gone on till now if Mrs Gibson
had not come in opportunely.'</DD>

<DD>
'I thought mamma had gone out some time ago!' said Cynthia, catching wafts
of the conversation as she flitted hither and thither among the flowers.</DD>

<DD>
'She came into the dining-room not five minutes ago. Do you want her, for
I see her crossing the hall at this very moment?' and Osborne half rose.</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, not at all!' said Cynthia. 'Only she seemed to be in such a hurry
to go out, I fancied she had set off long ago. She had some errand to do
for Lady Cumnor, and she thought she could manage to catch the housekeeper,
who is always in the town on Thursday.'</DD>

<DD>
'Are the family coming to the Towers this autumn?'</DD>

<DD>
'I believe so. But I don't know, and I don't much care. They don't take
kindly to me,' continued Cynthia, 'and so I suppose I am not generous enough
to take kindly to them.'</DD>

<DD>
'I should have thought that such a very unusual blot in their discrimination
would have interested you in them as extraordinary people,' said Osborne,
with a little air of conscious gallantry.</DD>

<DD>
'Isn't that a compliment?' said Cynthia, after a pause of mock meditation.
'If any one pays me a compliment, please let it be short and clear. I'm
very stupid at finding out hidden meanings.'</DD>

<DD>
'Then such speeches as "you are very pretty," or "you have charming manners,"
are what you prefer. Now, I pique myself on wrapping up my sugar-plums
delicately.'</DD>

<DD>
'Then would you please to write them down, and at my leisure I'll parse
them.'</DD>

<DD>
'No! It would be too much trouble. I'll meet you half way, and study clearness
next time.'</DD>

<DD>
'What are you two talking about?' said Molly, resting on her light spade.</DD>

<DD>
'It's only a discussion on the best way of administering compliments,'
said Cynthia, taking up her flower-basket again, but not going out of the
reach of the conversation.</DD>

<DD>
'I don't like them at all in any way,' said Molly. 'But, perhaps, it's
rather sour grapes with me,' she added.</DD>

<DD>
'Nonsense!' said Osborne. 'Shall I tell you what I heard of you at the
ball?'</DD>

<DD>
'Or shall I provoke Mr Preston,' said Cynthia, 'to begin upon you? It is
like turning a tap, such a stream of pretty speeches flow out at the moment.'
Her lip curled with scorn.</DD>

<DD>
'For you, perhaps,' said Molly; 'but not for me.'</DD>

<DD>
'For any woman. It is his notion of making himself agreeable. If you dare
me, Molly, I will try the experiment, and you'll see with what success.'</DD>

<DD>
'No, don't, pray!' said Molly, in a hurry. 'I do so dislike him!'</DD>

<DD>
'Why?' said Osborne, roused to a little curiosity by her vehemence.</DD>

<DD>
'Oh! I don't know. He never seems to know what one is feeling.'</DD>

<DD>
'He wouldn't care if he did know,' said Cynthia. 'And he might know he
is not wanted,'</DD>

<DD>
'If he chooses to stay, he cares little whether he is wanted or not.'</DD>

<DD>
'Come, this is very interesting,' said Osborne. 'It is like the strophe
and anti-strophe in a Greek chorus. Pray, go on.'</DD>

<DD>
'Don't you know him?' asked Molly.</DD>

<DD>
'Yes, by sight, and I think we were once introduced. But, you know, we
are much farther from Ashcombe, at Hamley, than you are here, at Hollingford.'</DD>

<DD>
'Oh! but he is coming to take Mr Sheepshanks' place, and then he will live
here altogether,' said Molly.</DD>

<DD>
'Molly! who told you that?' said Cynthia, in quite a different tone of
voice to that in which she had been speaking hitherto.</DD>

<DD>
'Papa, didn't you hear him? Oh, no! it was before you were down this morning.
Papa met Mr Sheepshanks yesterday, and he told him it was all settled:
you know we heard a rumour about it in the spring!'</DD>

<DD>
Cynthia was very silent after this. Presently, she said that she had gathered
all the flowers she wanted, and that the heat was so great she would go
indoors. And then Osborne went away. But Molly had set herself a task to
dig up such roots as had already flowered, and to put down some bedding-out
plants in their stead. Tired and heated as she was she finished it, and
then went upstairs to rest, and change her dress. According to her wont,
she sought for Cynthia; there was no reply to her soft knock at the bedroom-door
opposite to her own, and, thinking that Cynthia might have fallen asleep,
and be lying uncovered in the draught of the open window, she went in softly.
Cynthia was lying upon the bed as if she had thrown herself down on it
without caring for the ease or comfort of her position. She was very still;
and Molly took a shawl, and was going to place it over her, when she opened
her eyes, and spoke, -</DD>

<DD>
'Is that you, dear? Don't go. I like to know that you are there.'</DD>

<DD>
She shut her eyes again, and remained quite quiet for a few minutes longer.
Then she started up into a sitting posture, pushed her hair away from her
forehead and burning eyes, and gazed intently at Molly.</DD>

<DD>
'Do you know what I've been thinking, dear?' said she. 'I think I've been
long enough here, and that I had better go out as a governess.'</DD>

<DD>
'Cynthia, what do you mean?' asked Molly, aghast. 'You've been asleep -
you've been dreaming. You're overtired,' continued she, sitting down on
the bed, and taking Cynthia's passive hand, and stroking it softly - a
mode of caressing that had come down to her from her mother - whether as
an hereditary instinct, or as a lingering remembrance of the tender ways
of the dead woman, Mr Gibson often wondered within himself when he observed
it.</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, how good you are, Molly. I wonder, if I had been brought up like you,
if I should have been as good. But I've been tossed about so.'</DD>

<DD>
'Then, don't go and be tossed about any more,' said Molly, softly.</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, dear! I had better go. But, you see, no one ever loved me like you,
and, I think, your father - doesn't he, Molly? And it's hard to be driven
out.'</DD>

<DD>
'Cynthia, I am sure you're not well, or else you're not half awake.'</DD>

<DD>
Cynthia sate with her arms encircling her knees, and looking at vacancy.</DD>

<DD>
'Well!' said she, at last, heaving a great sigh; but, then, smiling as
she caught Molly's anxious face, 'I suppose there's no escaping one's doom;
and anywhere else I should be much more forlorn and unprotected.'</DD>

<DD>
'What do you mean by your doom?'</DD>

<DD>
'Ah, that's telling, little one,' said Cynthia, who seemed now to have
recovered her usual manner. 'I don't mean to have one, though. I think
that, though I am an arrant coward at heart, I can show fight.'</DD>

<DD>
'With whom?' asked Molly, really anxious to probe the mystery - if, indeed,
there was one - to the bottom, in the hope of some remedy being found for
the distress Cynthia was in when first Molly had entered,</DD>

<DD>
Again Cynthia was lost in thought; then, catching the echo of Molly's last
words in her mind, she said, -</DD>

<DD>
'"With whom?" - oh! show fight with whom - with my doom, to be sure. Am
not I a grand young lady to have a doom? Why, Molly, child, how pale and
grave you look!' said she, kissing her all of a sudden. 'You ought not
to care so much for me; I'm not good enough for you to worry yourself about
me. I've given myself up a long time ago as a heartless baggage!'</DD>

<DD>
'Nonsense! I wish you wouldn't talk so, Cynthia!'</DD>

<DD>
'And I wish you wouldn't always take me "at the foot of the letter," as
an English girl at school used to translate it. Oh, how hot it is! Is it
never going to get cool again? My child! what dirty hands you've got, and
face too; and I've been kissing you - I daresay I'm dirty with it, too.
Now, isn't that like one of mamma's speeches? But, for all that, you look
more like a delving Adam than a spinning Eve.'</DD>

<DD>
This had the effect that Cynthia intended; the daintily clean Molly became
conscious of her soiled condition, which she had forgotten while she had
been attending to Cynthia, and she hastily withdrew to her own room. When
she had gone, Cynthia noiselessly locked the door; and, taking her purse
out of her desk, she began to count over her money. She counted it once
- she counted it twice, as if desirous of finding out some mistake which
should prove it to be more than it was; but the end of it all was a sigh.</DD>

<DD>
'What a fool! - what a fool I was!' she said, at length. 'But even if I
don't go out as a governess, I shall make it up in time.'</DD>

<DD>
Some weeks after the time he had anticipated when he had spoken of his
departure to the Gibsons, Roger returned back to the Hall. One morning
when he called, Osborne told them that his brother had been at home for
two or three days.</DD>

<DD>
'And why has he not come here, then?' said Mrs Gibson. 'It is not kind
of him not to come and see us as soon as he can. Tell him I say so - pray
do.'</DD>

<DD>
Osborne had gained one or two ideas as to her treatment of Roger the last
time he had called. Roger had not complained of it, or even mentioned it,
till that very morning; when Osborne was on the point of starting, and
had urged Roger to accompany him, the latter had told him something of
what Mrs Gibson had said. He spoke rather as if he was more amused than
annoyed; but Osborne could read that he was chagrined at those restrictions
placed upon calls which were the greatest pleasure of his life. Neither
of them let out the suspicion which had entered both their minds - the
well-grounded suspicion arising from the fact that Osborne's visits, be
they paid early or late, had never yet been met with a repulse.</DD>

<DD>
Osborne now reproached himself with having done Mrs Gibson injustice. She
was evidently a weak, but probably a disinterested, woman; and it was only
a little bit of ill-temper on her part which had caused her to speak to
Roger as she had done.</DD>

<DD>
'I daresay it was rather impertinent of me to call at such an untimely
hour,' said Roger.</DD>

<DD>
'Not at all; I call at all hours, and nothing is ever said about it. It
was just because she was put out that morning. I'll answer for it she's
sorry now, and I'm sure you may go there at any time you like in the future.'</DD>

<DD>
Still, Roger did not choose to go again for two or three weeks, and the
consequence was that the next time he called the ladies were out. Once
again he had the same ill-luck, and then he received a little pretty three-cornered
note from Mrs Gibson: -</DD>

<DD>
MY DEAR SIR, - How is it that you are become so formal all on a sudden,
leaving cards, instead of awaiting our return? Fie for shame! If you had
seen the races of disappointment that I did when the horrid little bits
of pasteboard were displayed to our view, you would not have borne malice
against me so long; for it is really punishing others as well as my naughty
self. If you will come to-morrow - as early as you like - and lunch with
us, I'll own I was cross, and acknowledge myself a penitent. - Yours ever,</DD>

There was no resisting this, even if there had not been strong inclination
to back up the pretty words. Roger went, and Mrs Gibson caressed and petted
him in her sweetest, silkiest manner. Cynthia looked lovelier than ever
to him for the slight restriction that had been laid for a time on their
intercourse. She might be gay and sparkling with Osborne; with Roger she
was soft and grave. Instinctively she knew her men. She saw that Osborne
was only interested in her because of her position in a family with whom
he was intimate; that his friendship was without the least touch of sentiment;
and that his admiration was only the warm criticism of an artist for unusual
beauty. But she felt how different Roger's relation to her was. To him
she was <I>the</I> one, alone, peerless. If his love was prohibited, it
would be long years before he could sink down into tepid friendship; and
to him her personal loveliness was only one of the many charms that made
him tremble into passion. Cynthia was not capable of returning such feelings;
she had had too little true love in her life, and perhaps too much admiration
to do so; but she appreciated this honest ardour, this loyal worship that
was new to her experience. Such appreciation, and such respect for his
true and affectionate nature, gave a serious tenderness to her manner to
Roger, which allured him with a fresh and separate grace. Molly sate by,
and wondered how it would all end, or, rather, how soon it would all end,
for she thought that no girl could resist such reverent passion; and on
Roger's side there could be no doubt - alas! there could be no doubt. An
older spectator might have looked far ahead, and thought of the question
of pounds, shillings, and pence. Where was the necessary income for a marriage
to come from? Roger had his fellowship now, it is true; but the income
of that would be lost if he married; he had no profession, and the life
interest of the two or three thousand pounds that he inherited from his
mother, belonged to his father. This older spectator might have been a
little surprised at the <I>empressement</I> of Mrs Gibson's manner to a
younger son, always supposing this said spectator to have read to the depths
of her worldly heart. Never had she tried to be more agreeable to Osborne;
and though her attempt was a great failure when practised upon Roger, and
he did not know what to say in reply to the delicate Batteries which he
felt to be insincere, he saw that she intended him to consider himself
henceforward free of the house; and he was too glad to avail himself of
this privilege to examine over-closely into what might be her motives for
her change of manner. He shut his eyes, and chose to believe that she was
now desirous of making up for her little burst of temper on his previous
visit.</DD>

The result of Osborne's conference with the two doctors had been certain
prescriptions which appeared to have done him much good, and which would
in all probability have done him yet more, could he have been free of the
recollection of the little patient wife in her solitude near Winchester.
He went to her whenever he could; and, thanks to Roger, money was far more
plentiful with him now than it had been. But he still shrank, and perhaps
even more and more, from telling his father of his marriage. Some bodily
instinct made him dread all agitation inexpressibly. If he had not had
this money from Roger, he might have been compelled to tell his father
all, and to ask for the necessary funds to provide for the wife and the
coming child. But with enough in hand, and a secret, though remorseful,
conviction that as long as Roger had a penny his brother was sure to have
half of it, made him more reluctant than ever to irritate his father by
a revelation of his secret. 'Not just yet, not just at present,' he kept
saying both to Roger and to himself. 'By and by, if we have a boy, I will
call it Roger' - and then visions of poetical and romantic reconciliations
brought about between father and son, through the medium of a child, the
offspring of a forbidden marriage, became still more vividly possible to
him, and at any rate it was a staving-off of an unpleasant thing. He atoned
to himself for taking so much of Roger's fellowship money by reflecting
that, if Roger married, he would lose this source of revenue; yet Osborne
was throwing no impediment in the way of this event, rather forwarding
it by promoting every possible means of his brother's seeing the lady of
his love. Osborne ended his reflections by convincing himself of his own
generosity.</DD>
