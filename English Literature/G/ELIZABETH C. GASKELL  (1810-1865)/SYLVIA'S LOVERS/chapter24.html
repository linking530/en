Daniel's unusually late absence from home disturbed Bell and Sylvia not
a little. He was generally at home between eight and nine on market-days.
They expected to see him the worse for liquor at such times; but this did
not shock them; he was no worse than most of his neighbours) indeed better
than several, who went off once or twice a year) or even oftener, on drinking
bouts of two or three days' duration) returning pale, sodden, and somewhat
shame-faced, when all their money was gone; and, after the conjugal reception
was well over, settling down into hard-working and decently sober men until
the temptation again got power over them. But, on market days, every man
drank more than usual; every bargain or agreement was ratified by drink;
they came from greater or less distances, either afoot or on horseback,
and the 'good accommodation for man and beast' (as the old inn-signs expressed
it) always included a considerable amount of liquor to be drunk by the
man.

<P>Daniel's way of announcing his intention of drinking more than ordinary
was always the same. He would say at the last moment, 'Missus, I've a mind
to get fuddled to-neet,' and be off, disregarding her look of remonstrance,
and little heeding the injunctions she would call after him to beware of
such and such companions, or to attend to his footsteps on his road home.

<P>But this night he had given no such warning. Bell and Sylvia put the
candle on the low window-seat' at the usual hour to guide him through the
fields--it was a habit kept up even on moonlight nights like this--and
sate on each side of the fire, at first scarcely caring to listen, so secure
were they of his return. Bell dozed, and Sylvia sate gazing at the fire
with abstracted eyes, thinking of the past year and of the anniversary
which was approaching of the day when she had last seen the lover whom
she believed to be dead, lying somewhere fathoms deep beneath the surface
of that sunny sea on which she looked day by day without ever seeing his
upturned face through the depths, with whatsoever heart-sick longing for
just one more sight she yearned and inwardly cried. If she could set her
eyes on his bright, handsome face, that face which was fading from her
memory, overtasked in the too frequent efforts to recall it; if she could
but see him once again, coming over the waters beneath which he lay with
supernatural motion, awaiting her at the stile, with the evening sun shining
ruddy into his bonny eyes, even though, after that one instant of vivid
and visible life, he faded into mist; if she could but see him now, sitting
in the faintly flickering fire-light in the old, happy, careless way, on
a corner of the dresser, his legs dangling, his busy fingers playing with
some of her woman's work;--she wrung her hands tight together as she implored
some, any Power, to let her see him just once again--just once--for one
minute of passionate delight. Never again would she forget that dear face,
if but once more she might set her eyes upon it.

<P>Her mother's head fell with a sudden jerk, and she roused herself up;
and Sylvia put by her thought of the dead, and her craving after his presence,
into that receptacle of her heart where all such are kept closed and sacred
from the light of common day.

<P>'Feyther's late,' said Bell.

<P>'It's gone eight,' replied Sylvia.

<P>'But our clock is better nor an hour forrard,' answered Bell.

<P>'Ay, but t' wind brings Monkshaven bells clear to-night. I heerd t'
eight o'clock bell ringing not five minutes ago.'

<P>It was the fire-bell, but she had not distinguished the sound.

<P>There was another long silence; both wide awake this time.

<P>'He'll have his rheumatics again,' said Bell.

<P>'It's cold for sartin,' said Sylvia. 'March weather come afore its time.
But I'll make him a treacle-posset; it's a famous thing for keeping off
hoasts.'

<P>The treacle-posset was entertainment enough for both while it was being
made. But once placed in a little basin in the oven, there was again time
for wonder and anxiety.

<P>'He said nought about having a bout, did he, mother?' asked Sylvia at
length.

<P>'No,' said Bell, her face a little contracting. After a while she added,
'There's many a one as has husbands that goes off drinking without iver
saying a word to their wives. My master is none o' that mak'.'

<P>'Mother,' broke in Sylvia again, I'll just go and get t' lantern out
of t' shippen, and go up t' brow, and mebbe to t' ash-field end.'

<P>'Do, lass,' said her mother. 'I'll get my wraps and go with thee.'

<P>'Thou shall do niver such a thing,' said Sylvia. 'Thou's too frail to
go out i' t' night air such a night as this.'

<P>'Then call Kester up.'

<P>'Not I. I'm noane afraid o' t' dark.'

<P>'But of what thou mayst meet i' t' dark, lass?'

<P>Sylvia shivered all over at the sudden thought, suggested by this speech
of her mother's, that the idea that had flashed into her own mind of going
to look for her father might be an answer to the invocation to the Powers
which she had made not long ago, that she might indeed meet her dead lover
at the ash-field stile; but though she shivered as this superstitious fancy
came into her head, her heart beat firm and regular; not from darkness
nor from the spirits of the dead was she going to shrink; her great sorrow
had taken away all her girlish nervous fear.

<P>She went; and she came back. Neither man nor spirit had she seen; the
wind was blowing on the height enough to sweep all creatures before it;
but no one was coming.

<P>So they sate down again to keep watch. At length his step was heard
close to the door; and it startled them even in their state of expectation.

<P>'Why, feyther!' cried Sylvia as he entered; while his wife stood up
trembling, but not saying a word.

<P>'A'm a'most done up,' said he, sitting heavily down on the chair nearest
the door.

<P>'Poor old feyther!' said Sylvia, stooping to take off his heavy clogged
shoes; while Bell took the posset out of the oven.

<P>'What's this? posset? what creatures women is for slops,' said he; but
he drank it all the same, while Sylvia fastened the door, and brought the
flaring candle from the window-seat. The fresh arrangement of light displayed
his face blackened with smoke, and his clothes disarranged and torn.

<P>'Who's been melling wi' thee?' asked Bell.

<P>'No one has melled wi' me; but a've been mellin' wi' t' gang at last.'

<P>'Thee they niver were for pressing thee!' exclaimed both the women at
once.

<P>'No! they knowed better. They'n getten their belly-full as it is. Next
time they try it on, a reckon they'll ax if Daniel Robson is wi'in hearin'.
A've led a resky this neet, and saved nine or ten honest chaps as was pressed,
and carried off to t' Randyvowse. Me and some others did it. And Hobbs'
things and t' lieutenant's is a' burnt; and by this time a reckon t' Randyvowse
is pretty nigh four walls, ready for a parish-pound.'

<P>'Thou'rt niver for saying thou burnt it down wi' t' gang in it, for
sure?' asked Bell.

<P>'Na, na, not this time. T' 'gang fled up t' hill like coneys; and Hobbs
and his folks carried off a bag o' money; but t' oud tumbledown place is
just a heap o' brick and mortar; an' t' furniture is smoulderin' int' ashes;
and, best of a', t' men is free, and will niver be cotched wi' a fire-bell
again.'

<P>And so he went on to tell of the ruse by which they had been enticed
into the market-place; interrupted from time to time by their eager questions,
and interrupting himself every now and then with exclamations of weariness
and pain, which made him at last say,--

<P>'Now a'm willing to tell yo' a' about it to-morrow, for it's not ivery
day a man can do such great things; but to-neet a mun go to bed, even if
King George were wantin' for to know how a managed it a'.'

<P>He went wearily upstairs, and wife and daughter 'both strove their best
to ease his aching limbs, and make him comfortable. The warming-pan, only
used on state occasions, was taken down and unpapered for his service;
and as he got between the warm sheets, he thanked Sylvia and her mother
in a sleepy voice, adding,--

<P>'It's a vast o' comfort to think on yon poor lads as is sleepin' i'
their own homes this neet,' and then slumber fell upon him, and he was
hardly roused by Bell's softly kissing his weather-beaten cheek, and saying
low,--

<P>'God bless thee, my man! Thou was allays for them that was down and
put upon.'

<P>He murmured some monosyllabic reply, unheard by his wife, who stole
away to undress herself noiselessly, and laid herself down on her side
of the bed as gently as her stiffened limbs would permit.

<P>They were late in rising the next morning. Kester was long since up
and at his work among the cattle before he saw the house-door open to admit
the fresh chill morning air; and even then Sylvia brushed softly, and went
about almost on tip-toe. When the porridge was ready, Kester was called
in to his breakfast, which he took sitting at the dresser with the family.
A large wooden platter stood in the middle; and each had a bowl of the
same material filled with milk. The way was for every one to dip his pewter
spoon into the central dish, and convey as much or as little as he liked
at a time of the hot porridge into his pure fresh milk. But to-day Bell
told Kester to help himself all at once, and to take his bowl up to the
master's room and keep him company. For Daniel was in bed, resting from
his weariness, and bemoaning his painful bruises whenever he thought of
them. But his mind was still so much occupied with the affair of the previous
night, that Bell judged rightly that a new listener would give ease to
his body as well as to his mind, and her proposal of Kester's carrying
up his breakfast had been received by Daniel with satisfaction.

<P>So Kester went up slowly, carrying his over-full basin tenderly, and
seated himself on the step leading down into the bed-room (for levels had
not been calculated when the old house was built) facing his master, who,
half sitting up in the blue check bed, not unwillingly began his relation
again; to which Kester listened s6 attentively, that his spoon was often
arrested in its progress from the basin to his mouth, open ready to receive
it, while he gazed with unwinking eyes at Daniel narrating his exploits.

<P>But after Daniel had fought his battle o'er again to every auditor within
his reach, he found the seclusion of his chamber rather oppressive, without
even the usual week-days' noises below; so after dinner, though far from
well, he came down and wandered about the stable and the fields nearest
to the house, consulting with Kester as to crops and manure for the most
part; but every now and then breaking out into an episodical chuckle over
some part of last night's proceedings. Kester enjoyed the day even more
than his master, for he had no bruises to remind him that, although a hero,
he was also flesh and blood.

<P>When they returned to the house they found Philip there, for it was
already dusk. It was Kester's usual Sunday plan to withdraw to bed at as
early an hour as he could manage to sleep, often in winter before six;
but now he was too full of interest in what Philip might have to tell of
Monkshaven news to forego his Sabbath privilege of spending the evening
sitting on the chair at the end of the dresser behind the door.

<P>Philip was as close to Sylvia as he could possibly get with-out giving
her offence, when they came in. Her manner was listless and civil; she
had lost all that active feeling towards him which made him positively
distasteful, and had called out her girlish irritation and impertinence.
She now was rather glad to see him than otherwise. He brought some change
into the heavy monotony of her life--monotony so peaceful until she had
been stirred by passion out of that content with the small daily events
which had now become burdensome recurrences. Insensibly to herself she
was becoming dependent on his timid devotion, his constant attention; and
he, lover-like, once so attracted, in spite of his judgment, by her liveliness
and piquancy, now doted on her languor, and thought her silence more sweet
than words.

<P>He had only just arrived when master and man came in. He had been to
afternoon chapel; none of them had thought of going to the distant church;
worship with them was only an occasional duty, and this day their minds
had been too full of the events of the night before. Daniel sate himself
heavily down in his accustomed chair, the three-cornered arm-chair in the
fireside corner, which no one thought of anybody else ever occupying on
any occasion whatever. In a minute or two he interrupted Philip's words
of greeting and inquiry by breaking out into the story of the rescue of
last night. But to the mute surprise of Sylvia, the only one who noticed
it, Philip's face, instead of expressing admiration and pleasant wonder,
lengthened into dismay; once or twice he began to interrupt, but stopped
himself as if he would consider his words again. Kester was never tired
of hearing his master talk; by long living together they understood every
fold of each other's minds, and small expressions had much significance
to them. Bell, too, sate thankful that her husband should have done such
deeds. Only Sylvia was made uneasy by Philip's face and manner. When Daniel
had ended there was a great silence, instead of the questions and compliments
he looked to receive. He became testy, and turning to Bell, said,--

<P>'My nephew looks as though he was a-thinking more on t' little profit
he has made on his pins an' bobs, than as if he was heeding how honest
men were saved from being haled out to yon tender, an' carried out o' sight
o' wives and little 'uns for iver. Wives an' little 'uns may go t' workhouse
or clem for aught he cares.

<P>Philip went very red, and then more sallow than usual. He had not been
thinking of Charley Kinraid, but of quite another thing, while Daniel had
told his story; but this last speech of the old man's brought up the remembrance
that was always quick, do what he would to smother or strangle it. He did
not speak for a moment or two, then he said,--

<P>'To-day has not been like Sabbath in Monkshaven. T' rioters, as folks
call 'em, have been about all night. They wanted to give battle to t' men-o'-war's
men; and it were taken up by th' better end, and they've sent to my Lord
Malton for t' militia; and they're come into t' town, and they're hunting
for a justice for t' read th' act; folk do say there'll be niver a shop
opened to-morrow.'

<P>This was rather a more serious account of the progress of the affair
than any one had calculated upon. They looked grave upon it awhile, then
Daniel took heart and said,--

<P>'A think we'd done a'most enough last neet; but men's not to be stopped
wi' a straw when their blood is up; still it's hard lines to call out t'
sojers, even if they be but militia. So what we seven hatched in a dark
entry has ta'en a lord to put a stop to 't!' continued he, chuckling a
little, but more faintly this time.

<P>Philip went on, still graver than before, boldly continuing to say what
he knew would be discordant to the family he loved so well.

<P>'I should ha' telled yo' all about it; I thought on it just as a bit
o' news; I'd niver thought on such a thing as uncle there having been in
it and I'm main sorry to hear on it I am.'

<P>'Why?' said Sylvia, breathlessly.

<P>'It's niver a thing to be sorry on. I'm proud and glad,' said Bell.

<P>'Let-a-be, let-a-be,' said Daniel, in much dudgeon. 'A were a fool to
tell him o' such-like doings, they're noane i' his line; we'll talk on
yard measures now.

<P>Philip took no notice of this poor attempt at sarcasm he seemed as if
lost in thought, then he said,--

<P>'I'm vexed to plague yo', but I'd best say all I've got i' my mind.
There was a vast o' folk at our chapel speaking about it--last night's
doings and this morning's work--and how them as set it afoot was assured
o' being clapt int' prison and tried for it; and when I heered uncle say
as he was one, it like ran through me; for they say as t' justices will
be all on t' Government side, and mad for vengeance.

<P>For an instant there was dead silence. The women looked at each other
with blank eyes, as if they were as yet unable to take in the new idea
that the conduct which had seemed to them a subject for such just pride
could be regarded by any one as deserving of punishment or retribution.
Daniel spoke before they had recovered from their amazement.

<P>'A'm noane sorry for what a did, an' a'd do it again to-neet, if need
were. So theere's for thee. Thou may tell t' justices fra' me that a reckon
a did righter nor them, as letten poor fellys be carried off i' t' very
midst o' t' town they're called justices for.'

<P>Perhaps Philip had better have held his tongue; but he believed in the
danger, which he was anxious to impress upon his uncle, in order that,
knowing what was to be apprehended, the latter might take some pains to
avert it.

<P>He went on.

<P>'But they're making a coil about the Randyvowse being all destroyed!'

<P>Daniel had taken down his pipe from the shelf in the chimney corner,
and was stuffing tobacco into the bowl. He went on pretending to do this
a little while after it was filled; for, to tell the truth, he was beginning
to feel uncomfortable at the new view of his conduct presented to him.
Still he was not going to let this appear, so lifting up his head with
an indifferent air he lighted the pipe, blew into it, took it out and examined
it as something were wrong about it, and until that was put to rights he
was unable to attend to any-thing else; all the while the faithful three
who hung upon his well-being, gazing, breathless, at his proceedings, and
anxious for his reply.

<P>'Randyvowse!' said he at length, 'it were a good job it were brenned
down, for such a harbour for vermin a never seed: t' rats ran across t'
yard by hunders an' thousands; an' it were no man's property as a've heerd
tell, but belonged to Chancery, up i' Lunnon; so wheere's t' harm done,
my fine felly?'

<P>Philip was silent. He did not care to brave any further his uncle's
angry frown and contracted eye. If he had only known of Daniel Robson's
part in the riot before he had left the town, he would have taken care
to have had better authority for the reality of the danger which he had
heard spoken about, and in which he could not help believing. As it was,
he could only keep quiet until he had ascertained what was the legal peril
overhanging the rioters, and how far his uncle had been recognized.

<P>Daniel went on puffing angrily. Kester sighed audibly, and then was
sorry he had done so, and began to whistle. Bell, full of her new fear,
yet desirous to bring all present into some kind of harmony, said,--

<P>'It'll ha' been a loss to John Hobbs--all his things burnt, or trampled
on. Mebbe he desarved it all, but one's a kind o' tender feeling to one's
tables and chairs, special if one's had t' bees-waxing on 'em.'

<P>'A wish he'd been burnt on t' top on 'em, a do,' growled out Daniel,
shaking the ash out of his pipe.

<P>'Don't speak so ill o' thysel',' said his wife. 'Thou'd ha' been t'
first t' pluck him down if he'd screeched out.'

<P>'An' a'll warrant if they come about wi' a paper asking for feyther's
name to make up for what Hobbs has lost by t' fire, feyther 'll be for
giving him summut,' said Sylvia.

<P>'Thou knows nought about it,' said Daniel. 'Hold thy tongue next time
till thou's axed to speak, my wench.'

<P>His sharp irritated way of speaking was so new to Sylvia, that the tears
sprang to her eyes, and her lip quivered. Philip saw it all, and yearned
over her. He plunged headlong into some other subject to try and divert
attention from her; but Daniel was too ill at ease to talk much, and Bell
was obliged to try and keep up the semblance of conversation, with an occasional
word or two from Kester, who seemed instinctively to fall into her way
of thinking, and to endeavour to keep the dark thought in the background.

<P>Sylvia stole off to bed; more concerned at her father's angry way of
speaking than at the idea of his being amenable to law for what he had
done; the one was a sharp present evil, the other something distant and
unlikely. Yet a dim terror of this latter evil hung over her, and once
upstairs she threw herself on her bed and sobbed. Philip heard her where
he sate near the bottom of the short steep staircase, and at every sob
the cords of love round his heart seemed tightened, and he felt as if he
must there and then do something to console her.

<P>But, instead, he sat on talking of nothings, a conversation in which
Daniel joined with somewhat of surliness, while Bell, grave and anxious,
kept wistfully looking from one to the other, desirous of gleaning some
further information on the subject, which had begun to trouble her mind.
She hoped some chance would give her the opportunity of privately questioning
Philip, but it seemed to be equally her husband's wish to thwart any such
intention of hers. He remained in the house-place, till after Philip had
left, although he was evidently so much fatigued as to give some very distinct,
though unintentional, hints to his visitor to be gone.

<P>At length the house-door was locked on Philip, and then Daniel prepared
to go to bed. Kester had left for his loft above the shippen more than
an hour before. Bell had still to rake the fire, and then she would follow
her husband upstairs.

<P>As she was scraping up the ashes, she heard, intermixed with the noise
she was making, the sound of some one rapping gently at the window. In
her then frame of mind she started a little; but on looking round, she
saw Kester's face pressed against the glass, and, reassured, she softly
opened the door. There he stood in the dusk outer air, distinct against
the grey darkness beyond, and in his hand something which she presently
perceived was a pitchfork.

<P>'Missus!' whispered he, 'a've watched t' maister t' bed; an' now a'd
be greatly beholden to yo' if yo'd let me just lay me down i' t' house-place.
A'd warrant niver a constable i' a' Monkshaven should get sight o' t' maister,
an' me below t' keep ward.'

<P>Bell shivered a little.

<P>'Nay, Kester,' she said, patting her hand kindly on his shoulder; 'there's
nought for t' fear. Thy master is not one for t' hurt nobody; and I dunnot
think they can harm him for setting yon poor chaps free, as t' gang catched
i' their wicked trap.'

<P>Kester stood still; then he shook his head slowly.

<P>'It's t' work at t' Randyvowse as a'm afeared on. Some folks thinks
such a deal o' a bonfire. Then a may lay me down afore t' fire, missus?'
said he, beseechingly.

<P>'Nay, Kester--' she began; but suddenly changing, she said, 'God bless
thee, my man; come in and lay thee down on t' settle, and I'll cover thee
up wi' my cloak as hangs behind t' door. We're not many on us that love
him, an' we'll be all on us under one roof, an' niver a stone wall or a
lock betwixt us.'

<P>So Kester took up his rest in the house-place that night, and none knew
of it besides Bell.
