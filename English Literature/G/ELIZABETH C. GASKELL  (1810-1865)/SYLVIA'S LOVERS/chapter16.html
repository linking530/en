'As the day lengthens so the cold strengthens.' It was so that year; the
hard frost which began on New Year's Eve lasted on and on into late February,
black and bitter, but welcome enough to the farmers, as it kept back the
too early growth of autumn-sown wheat, and gave them the opportunity of
leading manure. But it did not suit invalids as well, and Bell Robson,
though not getting worse, did not make any progress towards amendment.
Sylvia was kept very busy, notwithstanding that she had the assistance
of a poor widow-woman in the neighbourhood on cleaning, or washing, or
churning days. Her life was quiet and monotonous, although hardworking;
and while her hands mechanically found and did their accustomed labour,
the thoughts that rose in her head always centred on Charley Kinraid, his
ways, his words, his looks, whether they all meant what she would fain
believe they did, and whether, meaning love at the time, such a feeling
was likely to endure. Her mother's story of crazy Nancy had taken hold
of her; but not as a 'caution,' rather as a parallel case to her own. Like
Nancy, and borrowing the poor girl's own words, she would say softly to
herself, 'He once was here;' but all along she believed in her heart he
would come back again to her, though it touched her strangely to imagine
the agonies of forsaken love.

<P>Philip knew little of all this. He was very busy with facts and figures,
doggedly fighting through the necessary business, and only now and then
allowing himself the delicious relaxation of going to Haytersbank in an
evening, to inquire after his aunt's health, and to see Sylvia; for the
two Fosters were punctiliously anxious to make their shopmen test all their
statements; insisting on an examination of the stock, as if Hepburn and
Coulson were strangers to the shop; having the Monkshaven auctioneer in
to appraise the fixtures and necessary furniture; going over the shop books
for the last twenty years with their successors, an employment which took
up evening after evening; and not unfrequently taking one of the young
men on the long commercial journeys which were tediously made in a gig.
By degrees both Hepburn and Coulson were introduced to distant manufacturers
and whole-sale dealers. They would have been willing to take the Fosters'
word for every statement the brothers had made on New Year's Day; but this,
it was evident, would not have satisfied their masters, who were scrupulous
in insisting that whatever advantage there were should always fall on the
side of the younger men.

<P>When Philip saw Sylvia she was always quiet and gentle; perhaps more
silent than she had been a year ago, and she did not attend so briskly
to what was passing around her. She was rather thinner and paler; but whatever
change there was in her was always an improvement in Philip's eyes, so
long as she spoke graciously to him. He thought she was suffering from
long-continued anxiety about her mother, or that she had too much to do;
and either cause was enough to make him treat her with a grave regard and
deference which had a repressed tenderness in it, of which she, otherwise
occupied, was quite unaware. She liked him better, too, than she had done
a year or two before, because he did not show her any of the eager attention
which teased her then, although its meaning was not fully understood.

<P>Things were much in this state when the frost broke, and milder weather
succeeded. This was the time so long looked forward to by the invalid and
her friends, as favouring the doctor's recommendation of change of air.
Her husband was to take her to spend a fortnight with a kindly neighbour,
who lived near the farm they had occupied, forty miles or so inland, before
they came to Haytersbank. The widow-woman was to come and stay in the house,
to keep Sylvia company, during her mother's absence. Daniel, indeed, was
to return home after conveying his wife to her destination; but there was
so much to be done on the land at this time of the year, that Sylvia would
have been alone all day had it not been for the arrangement just mentioned.

<P>There was active stirring in Monkshaven harbour as well as on shore.
The whalers were finishing their fittings-out for the Greenland seas. It
was a 'close' season, that is to say, there would be difficulty in passing
the barrier of ice which lay between the ships and the whaling-grounds;
and yet these must be reached before June, or the year's expedition would
be of little avail. Every blacksmith's shop rung with the rhythmical clang
of busy hammers, beating out old iron, such as horseshoes, nails or stubs,
into the great harpoons; the quays were thronged with busy and important
sailors, rushing hither and thither, conscious of the demand in which they
were held at this season of the year. It was war time, too. Many captains
unable to procure men in Monkshaven would have to complete their crews
in the Shetlands. The shops in the town were equally busy; stores had to
be purchased by the whaling-masters, warm clothing of all sorts to be provided.
These were the larger wholesale orders; but many a man, and woman, too,
brought out their small hoards to purchase extra comforts, or precious
keepsakes for some beloved one. It was the time of the great half-yearly
traffic of the place; another impetus was given to business when the whalers
returned in the autumn, and the men were flush of money, and full of delight
at once more seeing their homes and their friends.

<P>There was much to be done in Fosters' shop, and later hours were kept
than usual. Some perplexity or other was occupying John and Jeremiah Foster;
their minds were not so much on the alert as usual, being engaged on some
weighty matter of which they had as yet spoken to no one. But it thus happened
that they did not give the prompt assistance they were accustomed to render
at such times; and Coulson had been away on some of the new expeditions
devolving on him and Philip as future partners. One evening after the shop
was closed, while they were examining the goods, and comparing the sales
with the entries in the day-book, Coulson suddenly inquired--

<P>'By the way, Hester, does thee know where the parcel of best bandanas
is gone? There was four left, as I'm pretty sure, when I set off to Sandsend;
and to-day Mark Alderson came in, and would fain have had one, and I could
find none nowhere.'

<P>'I sold t' last to-day, to yon sailor, the specksioneer, who fought
the press-gang same time as poor Darley were killed. He took it, and three
yards of yon pink ribbon wi' t' black and yellow crosses on it, as Philip
could never abide. Philip has got 'em i' t' book, if he'll only look.'

<P>'Is he here again?' said Philip; 'I didn't see him. What brings him
here, where he's noan wanted?'

<P>'T' shop were throng wi' folk,' said Hester, 'and he knew his own mind
about the handkercher, and didn't tarry long. Just as he was leaving, his
eye caught on t' ribbon, and he came back for it. It were when yo' were
serving Mary Darby and there was a vast o' folk about yo'.'

<P>'I wish I'd seen him,' said Coulson. 'I'd ha' gi'en him a word and a
look he'd not ha' forgotten in a hurry.'

<P>'Why, what's up?' said Philip, surprised at William's unusual manner,
and, at the same time, rather gratified to find a reflection of his own
feelings about Kinraid. Coulson's face was pale with anger, but for a moment
or two he seemed uncertain whether he would reply or not.

<P>'Up!' said he at length. 'It's just this: he came after my sister for
better nor two year; and a better lass--no, nor a prettier i' my eyes--niver
broke bread. And then my master saw another girl, that he liked better'--William
almost choked in his endeavour to keep down all appearance of violent anger,
and then went on, ' and that he played t' same game wi', as I've heerd
tell.'

<P>'And how did thy sister take it?' asked Philip, eagerly.

<P>'She died in a six-month,' said William; '<I>she</I> forgived him, but
it's beyond me. I thought it were him when I heerd of t' work about Darley;
Kinraid--and coming fra' Newcassel, where Annie lived 'prentice--and I
made inquiry, and it were t' same man. But I'll say no more about him,
for it stirs t' old Adam more nor I like, or is fitting.'

<P>Out of respect to him, Philip asked no more questions although there
were many things that he fain would have known. Both Coulson and he went
silently and grimly through the remainder of their day's work. Independent
of any personal interest which either or both of them had or might have
in Kinraid's being a light o' love, this fault of his was one with which
the two grave, sedate young men had no sympathy. Their hearts were true
and constant, whatever else might be their failings; and it is no new thing
to 'damn the faults we have no mind to.' Philip wished that it was not
so late, or that very evening he would have gone to keep guard over Sylvia
in her mother's absence--nay, perhaps he might have seen reason to give
her a warning of some kind. But, if he had done so, it would have been
locking the stable-door after the steed was stolen. Kinraid had turned
his steps towards Haytersbank Farm as soon as ever he had completed his
purchases. He had only come that afternoon to Monkshaven, and for the sole
purpose of seeing Sylvia once more before he went to fulfil his engagement
as specksioneer in the <I>Urania</I>, a whaling-vessel that was to sail
from North Shields on Thursday morning, and this was Monday.

<P>Sylvia sat in the house-place, her back to the long low window, in order
to have all the light the afternoon hour afforded for her work. A basket
of her father's unmended stockings was on the little round table beside
her, and one was on her left hand, which she supposed herself to be mending;
but from time to time she made long pauses, and looked in the fire; and
yet there was but little motion of flame or light in it out of which to
conjure visions. It was 'redd up' for the afternoon; covered with a black
mass of coal, over which the equally black kettle hung on the crook. In
the back-kitchen Dolly Reid, Sylvia's assistant during her mother's absence,
chanted a lugubrious ditty, befitting her condition as a widow, while she
cleaned tins, and cans, and milking-pails. Perhaps these bustling sounds
prevented Sylvia from hearing approaching footsteps coming down the brow
with swift advance; at any rate, she started and suddenly stood up as some
one entered the open door. It was strange she should be so much startled,
for the person who entered had been in her thoughts all during those long
pauses. Charley Kinraid and the story of crazy Nancy had been the subjects
for her dreams for many a day, and many a night. Now he stood there, bright
and handsome as ever, wit h just that much timidity in his face, that anxiety
as to his welcome, which gave his accost an added charm, could she but
have perceived it. But she was so afraid of herself, so unwilling to show
what she felt, and how much she had been thinking of him in his absence,
that her reception seemed cold and still. She did not come forward to meet
him; she went crimson to the very roots of her hair; but that, in the waning
light, he could not see; and she shook so that she felt as if she could
hardly stand; but the tremor was not visible to him. She wondered if he
remembered the kiss that had passed between them on New Year's Eve--the
words that had been spoken in the dairy on New Year's Day; the tones, the
looks, that had accompanied those words. But all she said was--

<P>'I didn't think to see yo'. I thought yo'd ha' sailed.'

<P>'I told yo' I should come back, didn't I?' said he, still standing,
with his hat in his hand, waiting to be asked to sit down; and she, in
her bashfulness, forgetting to give the invitation, but, instead, pretending
to be attentively mending the stocking she held. Neither could keep quiet
and silent long. She felt his eyes were upon her, watching every motion,
and grew more and more confused in her expression and behaviour. He was
a little taken aback by the nature of his reception, and was not sure at
first whether to take the great change in her manner, from what it had
been when last he saw her, as a favourable symptom or otherwise. By-and-by,
luckily for him, in some turn of her arm to reach the scissors on the table,
she caught the edge of her work-basket, and down it fell. She stooped to
pick up the scattered stockings and ball of worsted, and so did he; and
when they rose up, he had fast hold of her hand, and her face was turned
away, half ready to cry.

<P>'What ails yo' at me?' said he, beseechingly. 'Yo' might ha' forgotten
me; and yet I thought we made a bargain against forgetting each other.'
No answer. He went on: 'Yo've never been out o' my thoughts, Sylvia Robson;
and I'm come back to Monkshaven for nought but to see you once and again
afore I go away to the northern seas. It's not two hour sin' I landed at
Monkshaven, and I've been near neither kith nor kin as yet; and now I'm
here you won't speak to me.'

<P>'I don't know what to say,' said she, in a low, almost inaudible tone.
Then hardening herself, and resolving to speak as if she did not understand
his only half-expressed meaning, she lifted up her head, and all but looking
at him--while she wrenched her hand out of his--she said: 'Mother's gone
to Middleham for a visit, and feyther's out i' t' plough-field wi' Kester;
but he'll be in afore long.'

<P>Charley did not speak for a minute or so. Then he said--

<P>'Yo're not so dull as to think I'm come all this way for t' see either
your father or your mother. I've a great respect for 'em both; but I'd
hardly ha' come all this way for to see 'em, and me bound to be back i'
Shields, if I walk every step of the way, by Wednesday night. It's that
yo' won't understand my meaning, Sylvia; it's not that yo' don't, or that
yo' can't.' He made no effort to repossess himself of her hand. She was
quite silent, but in spite of herself she drew long hard breaths. 'I may
go back to where I came from,' he went on. 'I thought to go to sea wi'
a blessed hope to cheer me up, and a knowledge o' some one as loved me
as I'd left behind; some one as loved me half as much as I did her; for
th' measure o' my love toward her is so great and mighty, I'd be content
wi' half as much from her, till I'd taught her to love me more. But if
she's a cold heart and cannot care for a honest sailor, why, then, I'd
best go back at once.'

<P>He made for the door. He must have been pretty sure from some sign or
other, or he would never have left it to her womanly pride to give way,
and for her to make the next advance. He had not taken two steps when she
turned quickly towards him, and said something--the echo of which, rather
than the words themselves, reached him.

<P>'I didn't know yo' cared for me; yo' niver said so.' In an instant he
was back at her side, his arm round her in spite of her short struggle,
and his eager passionate voice saying, 'Yo' never knowed I loved you, Sylvia?
say it again, and look i' my face while yo' say it, if yo' can. Why, last
winter I thought yo'd be such a woman when yo'd come to be one as my een
had never looked upon, and this year, ever sin' I saw yo' i' the kitchen
corner sitting crouching behind my uncle, I as good as swore I'd have yo'
for wife, or never wed at all. And it was not long ere yo' knowed it, for
all yo' were so coy, and now yo' have the face--no, yo' have not the face--come,
my darling, what is it?' for she was crying; and on his turning her wet
blushing face towards him the better to look at it, she suddenly hid it
in his breast. He lulled and soothed her in his arms, as if she had been
a weeping child and he her mother; and then they sat down on the settle
together, and when she was more composed they began to talk. He asked her
about her mother; not sorry in his heart at Bell Robson's absence. He had
intended if necessary to acknowledge his wishes and desires with regard
to Sylvia to her parents; but for various reasons he was not sorry that
circumstances had given him the chance of seeing her alone, and obtaining
her promise to marry him without being obliged to tell either her father
or her mother at present. 'I ha' spent my money pretty free,' he said,
'and I've ne'er a penny to the fore, and yo'r parents may look for something
better for yo', my pretty: but when I come back fro' this voyage I shall
stand a chance of having a share i' th' <I>Urania</I>, and maybe I shall
be mate as well as specksioneer; and I can get a matter of from seventy
to ninety pound a voyage, let alone th' half-guineas for every whale I
strike, and six shilling a gallon on th' oil; and if I keep steady wi'
Forbes and Company, they'll make me master i' time, for I've had good schooling,
and can work a ship as well as any man; an' I leave yo' wi' yo'r parents,
or take a cottage for yo' nigh at hand; but I would like to have something
to the fore, and that I shall have, please God, when we come back i' th'
autumn. I shall go to sea happy, now, thinking I've yo'r word. Yo're not
one to go back from it, I'm sure, else it's a long time to leave such a
pretty girl as yo', and ne'er a chance of a letter reaching yo' just to
tell yo' once again how I love yo', and to bid yo' not forget yo'r true
love.'

<P>'There'll be no need o' that,' murmured Sylvia.

<P>She was too dizzy with happiness to have attended much to his details
of his worldly prospects, but at the sound of his tender words of love
her eager heart was ready to listen.

<P>'I don't know,' said he, wanting to draw her out into more confession
of her feelings. 'There's many a one ready to come after yo'; and yo'r
mother is not o'er captivated wi' me; and there's yon tall fellow of a
cousin as looks black at me, for if I'm not mista'en he's a notion of being
sweet on yo' hisself.'

<P>'Not he,' said Sylvia, with some contempt in her tone. 'He's so full
o' business and t' shop, and o' makin' money, and gettin' wealth.'

<P>'Ay, ay; but perhaps when he gets a rich man he'll come and ask my Sylvia
to be his wife, and what will she say then?'

<P>'He'll niver come asking such a foolish question,' said she, a little
impatiently; 'he knows what answer he'd get if he did.'

<P>Kinraid said, almost as if to himself, 'Yo'r mother favours him though.'
But she, weary of a subject she cared nothing about, and eager to identify
herself with all his interests, asked him about his plans almost at the
same time that he said these last words; and they went on as lovers do,
intermixing a great many tender expressions with a very little conversation
relating to facts.

<P>Dolly Reid came in, and went out softly, unheeded by them. But Sylvia's
listening ears caught her father's voice, as he and Kester returned homewards
from their day's work in the plough-field; and she started away, and fled
upstairs in shy affright, leaving Charley to explain his presence in the
solitary kitchen to her father.

<P>He came in, not seeing that any one was there at first; for they had
never thought of lighting a candle. Kinraid stepped forward into the firelight;
his purpose of concealing what he had said to Sylvia quite melted away
by the cordial welcome her father gave him the instant that he recognized
him.

<P>'Bless thee, lad! who'd ha' thought o' seein' thee? Why, if iver a thought
on thee at all, it were half way to Davis' Straits. To be sure, t' winter's
been a dree season, and thou'rt, maybe, i' t' reet on 't to mak' a late
start. Latest start as iver I made was ninth o' March, an' we struck thirteen
whales that year.'

<P>'I have something to say to you,' said Charley, in a hesitating voice,
so different to his usual hearty way, that Daniel gave him a keen look
of attention before he began to speak. And, perhaps, the elder man was
not unprepared for the communication that followed. At any rate, it was
not unwelcome. He liked Kinraid, and had strong sympathy not merely with
what he knew of the young sailor's character, but with the life he led,
and the business he followed. Robson listened to all he said with approving
nods and winks, till Charley had told him everything he had to say; and
then he turned and struck his broad horny palm into Kinraid's as if concluding
a bargain, while he expressed in words his hearty consent to their engagement.
He wound up with a chuckle, as the thought struck him that this great piece
of business, of disposing of their only child, had been concluded while
his wife was away.

<P>'A'm noane so sure as t' missus 'll like it,' said he; 'tho' whativer
she'll ha' to say again it, mischief only knows. But she's noane keen on
matterimony; though a have made her as good a man as there is in a' t'
Ridings. Anyhow, a'm master, and that she knows. But maybe, for t' sake
o' peace an quietness--tho' she's niver a scolding tongue, that a will
say for her--we'n best keep this matter to ourselves till thou comes int'
port again. T' lass upstairs 'll like nought better than t' curl hersel'
round a secret, and purr o'er it, just as t' oud cat does o'er her blind
kitten. But thou'll be wanting to see t' lass, a'll be bound. An oud man
like me isn't as good company as a pretty lass.' Laughing a low rich laugh
over his own wit, Daniel went to the bottom of the stairs, and called,
'Sylvie, Sylvie! come down, lass! a's reet; come down!'

<P>For a time there was no answer. Then a door was unbolted, and Sylvia
said,

<P>'I can't come down again. I'm noane comin' down again to-night.'

<P>Daniel laughed the more at this, especially when he caught Charley's
look of disappointment.

<P>'Hearken how she's bolted her door. She'll noane come near us this neet.
Eh! but she's a stiff little 'un; she's been our only one, and we'n mostly
let her have her own way. But we'll have a pipe and a glass; and that,
to my thinking, is as good company as iver a woman i' Yorkshire.'
