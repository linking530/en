<DD>
Philip and Sylvia were engaged. It was not so happy a state of things as
Philip had imagined. He had already found that out, although it was not
twenty-four hours since Sylvia had promised to be his. He could not have
defined why he was dissatisfied; if he had been compelled to account for
his feeling, he would probably have alleged as a reason that Sylvia's manner
was so unchanged by her new position towards him. She was quiet and gentle;
but no shyer, no brighter, no coyer, no happier, than she had been for
months before. When she joined him at the field-gate, his heart was beating
fast, his eyes were beaming out love at her approach. She neither blushed
nor smiled, but seemed absorbed in thought of some kind. But she resisted
his silent effort to draw her away from the path leading to the house,
and turned her face steadily homewards. He murmured soft words, which she
scarcely heard. Right in their way was the stone trough for the fresh bubbling
water, that, issuing from a roadside spring, served for all the household
purposes of Haytersbank Farm. By it were the milk-cans, glittering and
clean. Sylvia knew she should have to stop for these, and carry them back
home in readiness for the evening's milking; and at this time, during this
action, she resolved to say what was on her mind.</DD>

<DD>
They were there. Sylvia spoke.</DD>

<DD>
'Philip, Kester has been saying as how it might ha' been----'</DD>

<DD>
'Well!' said Philip.</DD>

<DD>
Sylvia sate down on the edge of the trough, and dipped her hot little hand
in the water. Then she went on quickly, and lifting her beautiful eyes
to Philip's face, with a look of inquiry--'He thinks as Charley Kinraid
may ha' been took by t' press-gang.'</DD>

<DD>
It was the first time she had named the name of her former lover to her
present one since the day, long ago now, when they had quarrelled about
him; and the rosy colour flushed her all over; but her sweet, trustful
eyes never flinched from their steady, unconscious gaze.</DD>

<DD>
Philip's heart stopped beating; literally, as if he had come to a sudden
precipice, while he had thought himself securely walking on sunny greensward.
He went purple all over from dismay; he dared not take his eyes away from
that sad, earnest look of hers, but he was thankful that a mist came before
them and drew a veil before his brain. He heard his own voice saying words
he did not seem to have framed in his own mind.</DD>

<DD>
'Kester's a d--d fool,' he growled.</DD>

<DD>
'He says there's mebbe but one chance i' a hundred,' said Sylvia, pleading,
as it were, for Kester; 'but oh! Philip, think yo' there's just that one
chance?'</DD>

<DD>
'Ay, there's a chance, sure enough,' said Philip, in a kind of fierce despair
that made him reckless what he said or did. 'There's a chance, I suppose,
for iverything i' life as we have not seen with our own eyes as it may
not ha' happened. Kester may say next as there's a chance as your father
is not dead, because we none on us saw him----'</DD>

<DD>
'Hung,' he was going to have said, but a touch of humanity came back into
his stony heart. Sylvia sent up a little sharp cry at his words. He longed
at the sound to take her in his arms and hush her up, as a mother hushes
her weeping child. But the very longing, having to be repressed, only made
him more beside himself with guilt, anxiety, and rage. They were quite
still now. Sylvia looking sadly down into the bubbling, merry, flowing
water: Philip glaring at her, wishing that the next word were spoken, though
it might stab him to the heart. But she did not speak.</DD>

<DD>
At length, unable to bear it any longer, he said, 'Thou sets a deal o'
store on that man, Sylvie.'</DD>

<DD>
If 'that man' had been there at the moment, Philip would have grappled
with him, and not let go his hold till one or the other were dead. Sylvia
caught some of the passionate meaning of the gloomy, miserable tone of
Philip's voice as he said these words. She looked up at him.</DD>

<DD>
'I thought yo' knowed that I cared a deal for him.'</DD>

<DD>
There was something so pleading and innocent in her pale, troubled face,
so pathetic in her tone, that Philip's anger, which had been excited against
her, as well as against all the rest of the world, melted away into love;
and once more he felt that have her for his own he must, at any cost. He
sate down by her, and spoke to her in quite a different manner to that
which he had used before, with a ready tact and art which some strange
instinct or tempter 'close at his ear' supplied.</DD>

<DD>
'Yes, darling, I knew yo' cared for him. I'll not say ill of him that is--dead--ay,
dead and drowned--whativer Kester may say--before now; but if I chose I
could tell tales.'</DD>

<DD>
'No! tell no tales; I'll not hear them,' said she, wrenching herself out
of Philip's clasping arm. 'They may misca' him for iver, and I'll not believe
'em.'</DD>

<DD>
'I'll niver miscall one who is dead,' said Philip; each new unconscious
sign of the strength of Sylvia's love for her former lover only making
him the more anxious to convince her that he was dead, only rendering him
more keen at deceiving his own conscience by repeating to it the lie that
long ere this Kinraid was in all probability dead--killed by either the
chances of war or tempestuous sea; that, even if not, he was as good as
dead to her; so that the word 'dead' might be used in all honest certainty,
as in one of its meanings Kinraid was dead for sure.</DD>

<DD>
'Think yo' that if he were not dead he wouldn't ha' written ere this to
some one of his kin, if not to thee? Yet none of his folk Newcassel-way
but believe him dead.'</DD>

<DD>
'So Kester says,' sighed Sylvia.</DD>

<DD>
Philip took heart. He put his arm softly round her again, and murmured--</DD>

<DD>
'My lassie, try not to think on them as is gone, as is dead, but t' think
a bit more on him as loves yo' wi' heart, and soul, and might, and has
done iver sin' he first set eyes on yo'. Oh, Sylvie, my love for thee is
just terrible.'</DD>

<DD>
At this moment Dolly Reid was seen at the back-door of the farmhouse, and
catching sight of Sylvia, she called out--</DD>

<DD>
'Sylvia, thy mother is axing for thee, and I cannot make her mind easy.'</DD>

<DD>
In a moment Sylvia had sprung up from her seat, and was running in to soothe
and comfort her mother's troubled fancies.</DD>

<DD>
Philip sate on by the well-side, his face buried in his two hands. Presently
he lifted himself up, drank some water eagerly out of his hollowed palm,
sighed, and shook himself, and followed his cousin into the house. Sometimes
he came unexpectedly to the limits of his influence over her. In general
she obeyed his expressed wishes with gentle indifference, as if she had
no preferences of her own; once or twice he found that she was doing what
he desired out of the spirit of obedience, which, as her mother's daughter,
she believed to be her duty towards her affianced husband. And this last
motive for action depressed her lover more than anything. He wanted the
old Sylvia back again; captious, capricious, wilful, haughty, merry, charming.
Alas! that Sylvia was gone for ever.</DD>

<DD>
But once especially his power, arising from whatever cause, was stopped
entirely short--was utterly of no avail.</DD>

<DD>
It was on the occasion of Dick Simpson's mortal illness. Sylvia and her
mother kept aloof from every one. They had never been intimate with any
family but the Corneys, and even this friendship had considerably cooled
since Molly's marriage, and most especially since Kinraid's supposed death,
when Bessy Corney and Sylvia had been, as it were, rival mourners. But
many people, both in Monkshaven and the country round about, held the Robson
family in great respect, although Mrs Robson herself was accounted 'high'
and 'distant;' and poor little Sylvia, in her heyday of beautiful youth
and high spirits, had been spoken of as 'a bit flighty,' and 'a set-up
lassie.' Still, when their great sorrow fell upon them, there were plenty
of friends to sympathize deeply with them; and, as Daniel had suffered
in a popular cause, there were even more who, scarcely knowing them personally,
were ready to give them all the marks of respect and friendly feeling in
their power. But neither Bell nor Sylvia were aware of this. The former
had lost all perception of what was not immediately before her; the latter
shrank from all encounters of any kind with a sore heart, and sensitive
avoidance of everything that could make her a subject of remark. So the
poor afflicted people at Haytersbank knew little of Monkshaven news. What
little did come to their ears came through Dolly Reid, when she returned
from selling the farm produce of the week; and often, indeed, even then
she found Sylvia too much absorbed in other cares or thoughts to listen
to her gossip. So no one had ever named that Simpson was supposed to be
dying till Philip began on the subject one evening. Sylvia's face suddenly
flashed into glow and life.</DD>

<DD>
'He's dying, is he? t' earth is well rid on such a fellow!'</DD>

<DD>
'Eh, Sylvie, that's a hard speech o' thine!' said Philip; 'it gives me
but poor heart to ask a favour of thee!'</DD>

<DD>
'If it's aught about Simpson,' replied she, and then she interrupted herself.
'But say on; it were ill-mannered in me for t' interrupt yo'.'</DD>

<DD>
'Thou would be sorry to see him, I think, Sylvie. He cannot get over the
way, t' folk met him, and pelted him when he came back fra' York,--and
he's weak and faint, and beside himself at times; and he'll lie a dreaming,
and a-fancying they're all at him again, hooting, and yelling, and pelting
him.'</DD>

<DD>
'I'm glad on 't,' said Sylvia; 'it's t' best news I've heered for many
a day,--he, to turn again' feyther, who gave him money fo t' get a lodging
that night, when he'd no place to go to. It were his evidence as hung feyther;
and he's rightly punished for it now.'</DD>

<DD>
'For a' that,--and he's done a vast o' wrong beside, he's dying now, Sylvie!'</DD>

<DD>
'Well! let him die--it's t' best thing he could do!'</DD>

<DD>
'But he's lying i' such dree poverty,--and niver a friend to go near him,--niver
a person to speak a kind word t' him.'</DD>

<DD>
'It seems as yo've been speaking wi' him, at any rate,' said Sylvia, turning
round on Philip.</DD>

<DD>
'Ay. He sent for me by Nell Manning, th' old beggar-woman, who sometimes
goes in and makes his bed for him, poor wretch,--he's lying in t' ruins
of th' cow-house of th' Mariners' Arms, Sylvie.'</DD>

<DD>
'Well! 'said she, in the same hard, dry tone.</DD>

<DD>
'And I went and fetched th' parish doctor, for I thought he'd ha' died
before my face,--he was so wan, and ashen-grey, so thin, too, his eyes
seem pushed out of his bony face.'</DD>

<DD>
'That last time--feyther's eyes were starting, wild-like, and as if he
couldn't meet ours, or bear the sight on our weeping.'</DD>

<DD>
It was a bad look-out for Philip's purpose; but after a pause he went bravely
on.</DD>

<DD>
'He's a poor dying creature, anyhow. T' doctor said so, and told him he
hadn't many hours, let alone days, to live.'</DD>

<DD>
'And he'd shrink fra' dying wi' a' his sins on his head?' said Sylvia,
almost exultingly.</DD>

<DD>
Philip shook his head. 'He said this world had been too strong for him,
and men too hard upon him; he could niver do any good here, and he thought
he should, maybe, find folks i' t' next place more merciful.'</DD>

<DD>
'He'll meet feyther theere,' said Sylvia, still hard and bitter.</DD>

<DD>
'He's a poor ignorant creature, and doesn't seem to know rightly who he's
like to meet; only he seems glad to get away fra' Monkshaven folks; he
were really hurt, I am afeared, that night, Sylvie,--and he speaks as if
he'd had hard times of it ever since he were a child,--and he talks as
if he were really grieved for t' part t' lawyers made him take at th' trial,--they
made him speak, against his will, he says.'</DD>

<DD>
'Couldn't he ha' bitten his tongue out?' asked Sylvia. 'It's fine talking
o' sorrow when the thing is done!'</DD>

<DD>
'Well, anyhow he's sorry now; and he's not long for to live. And, Sylvie,
he bid me ask thee, if, for the sake of all that is dear to thee both here,
and i' th' world to come, thou'd go wi' me, and just say to him that thou
forgives him his part that day.'</DD>

<DD>
'He sent thee on that errand, did he? And thou could come and ask me? I've
a mind to break it off for iver wi' thee, Philip.' She kept gasping, as
if she could not say any more. Philip watched and waited till her breath
came, his own half choked.</DD>

<DD>
'Thee and me was niver meant to go together. It's not in me to forgive,--I
sometimes think it's not in me to forget. I wonder, Philip, if thy feyther
had done a kind deed--and a right deed--and a merciful deed--and some one
as he'd been good to, even i' t' midst of his just anger, had gone and
let on about him to th' judge, as was trying to hang him,--and had getten
him hanged,--hanged dead, so that his wife were a widow, and his child
fatherless for ivermore,--I wonder if thy veins would run milk and water,
so that thou could go and make friends, and speak soft wi' him as had caused
thy feyther's death?'</DD>

<DD>
'It's said in t' Bible, Sylvie, that we're to forgive.'</DD>

<DD>
'Ay, there's some things as I know I niver forgive; and there's others
as I can't--and I won't, either.'</DD>

<DD>
'But, Sylvie, yo' pray to be forgiven your trespasses, as you forgive them
as trespass against you.'</DD>

<DD>
'Well, if I'm to be taken at my word, I'll noane pray at all, that's all.
It's well enough for them as has but little to forgive to use them words;
and I don't reckon it's kind, or pretty behaved in yo', Philip, to bring
up Scripture again' me. Thou may go about thy business.'</DD>

<DD>
'Thou'rt vexed with me, Sylvie; and I'm not meaning but that it would go
hard with thee to forgive him; but I think it would be right and Christian-like
i' thee, and that thou'd find thy comfort in thinking on it after. If thou'd
only go, and see his wistful eyes--I think they'd plead wi' thee more than
his words, or mine either.'</DD>

<DD>
'I tell thee my flesh and blood wasn't made for forgiving and forgetting.
Once for all, thou must take my word. When I love I love, and when I hate
I hate; and him as has done hard to me, or to mine, I may keep fra' striking
or murdering, but I'll niver forgive. I should be just a monster, fit to
be shown at a fair, if I could forgive him as got feyther hanged.'</DD>

<DD>
Philip was silent, thinking what more he could urge.</DD>

<DD>
'Yo'd better be off,' said Sylvia, in a minute or two. 'Yo' and me has
got wrong, and it'll take a night's sleep to set us right. Yo've said all
yo' can for him; and perhaps it's not yo' as is to blame, but yo'r nature.
But I'm put out wi' thee, and want thee out o' my sight for awhile.'</DD>

<DD>
One or two more speeches of this kind convinced him that it would be wise
in him to take her at her word. He went back to Simpson, and found him,
though still alive, past the understanding of any words of human forgiveness.
Philip had almost wished he had not troubled or irritated Sylvia by urging
the dying man's request: the performance of this duty seemed now to have
been such a useless office.</DD>

<DD>
After all, the performance of a duty is never a useless office, though
we may not see the consequences, or they may be quite different to what
we expected or calculated on. In the pause of active work, when daylight
was done, and the evening shades came on, Sylvia had time to think; and
her heart grew sad and soft, in comparison to what it had been when Philip's
urgency had called out all her angry opposition. She thought of her father--his
sharp passions his frequent forgiveness, or rather his forgetfulness that
he had even been injured. All Sylvia's persistent or enduring qualities
were derived from her mother, her impulses from her father. It was her
dead father whose example filled her mind this evening in the soft and
tender twilight. She did not say to herself that she would go and tell
Simpson that she forgave him; but she thought that if Philip asked her
again that she should do so.</DD>

<DD>
But when she saw Philip again he told her that Simpson was dead; and passed
on from what he had reason to think would be an unpleasant subject to her.
Thus he never learnt how her conduct might have been more gentle and relenting
than her words--words which came up into his memory at a future time, with
full measure of miserable significance.</DD>

<DD>
In general, Sylvia was gentle and good enough; but Philip wanted her to
be shy. and tender with him, and this she was not. She spoke to him, her
pretty eyes looking straight and composedly at him. She consulted him like
the family friend that he was she met him quietly in all the arrangements
for the dine of their marriage, which she looked upon more as a change
of home, as the leaving of Haytersbank, as it would affect her mother,
than in any more directly personal way. Philip was beginning to feel, though
not as yet to acknowledge, that the fruit he had so inordinately longed
for was but of the nature of an apple of Sodom.</DD>

<DD>
Long ago, lodging in widow Rose's garret, he had been in the habit of watching
some pigeons that were kept by a neighbour; the flock disported themselves
on the steep tiled roofs just opposite to the attic window, and insensibly
Philip grew to know their ways, and one pretty, soft little dove was somehow
perpetually associated in his mind with his idea of his cousin Sylvia.
The pigeon would sit in one particular place, sunning herself, and puffing
out her feathered breast, with all the blue and rose-coloured lights gleaming
in the morning rays, cooing softly to herself as she dressed her plumage.
Philip fancied that he saw the same colours in a certain piece of shot
silk--now in the shop; and none other seemed to him so suitable for his
darling's wedding-dress. He carried enough to make a gown, and gave it
to her one evening, as she sate on the grass just outside the house, half
attending to her mother, half engaged in knitting stockings for her scanty
marriage outfit. He was glad that the sun was not gone down, thus allowing
him to display the changing colours in fuller light. Sylvia admired it
duly; even Mrs. Robson was pleased and attracted by the soft yet brilliant
hues. Philip whispered to Sylvia--(he took delight in whispers,--she, on
the contrary, always spoke to him in her usual tone of voice)--</DD>

<DD>
'Thou'lt look so pretty in it, sweetheart,--o' Thursday fortnight!'</DD>

<DD>
'Thursday fortnight. On the fourth yo're thinking on. But I cannot wear
it then,--I shall be i' black.'</DD>

<DD>
'Not on that day, sure!' said Philip.</DD>

<DD>
'Why not? There's nought t' happen on that day for t' make me forget feyther.
I couldn't put off my black, Philip,--no, not. to save my life! Yon silk
is just lovely, far too good for the likes of me,--and I'm sure I'm much
beholden to yo'; and I'll have it made up first of any gown after last
April come two years,--but, oh, Philip, I cannot put off my mourning!'</DD>

<DD>
'Not for our wedding-day!' said Philip, sadly.</DD>

<DD>
'No, lad, I really cannot. I'm just sorry about it, for I see thou'rt set
upon it; and thou'rt so kind and good, I sometimes think I can niver be
thankful enough to thee. When I think on what would ha' become of mother
and me if we hadn't had thee for a friend i' need, I'm noane ungrateful,
Philip; tho' I sometimes fancy thou'rt thinking I am.'</DD>

<DD>
'I don't want yo' to be grateful, Sylvie,' said poor Philip, dissatisfied,
yet unable to explain what he did want; only knowing that there was something
he lacked, yet fain would have had.</DD>

<DD>
As the marriage-day drew near, all Sylvia's care seemed to be for her mother;
all her anxiety was regarding the appurtenances of the home she was leaving.
In vain Philip tried to interest her in details of his improvements or
contrivances in the new home to which he was going to take her. She did
not tell him; but the idea of the house behind the shop was associated
in her mind with two times of discomfort and misery. The first time she
had gone into the parlour about which Philip spoke so much was at the time
of the press-gang riot, when she had fainted from terror and excitement;
the second was on that night of misery when she and her mother had gone
in to Monkshaven, to bid her father farewell before he was taken to York;
in that room, on that night, she had first learnt something of the fatal
peril in which he stood. She could not show the bright shy curiosity about
her future dwelling that is common enough with girls who are going to be
married. All she could do was to restrain herself from sighing, and listen
patiently, when he talked on the subject. In time he saw that she shrank
from it; so he held his peace, and planned and worked for her in silence,--smiling
to him-self as he looked on each completed arrangement for her pleasure
or comfort; and knowing well that her happiness was involved in what fragments
of peace. and material comfort might remain to her mother.</DD>

<DD>
The wedding-day drew near apace. It was Philip's plan that after they had
been married in Kirk Moorside church, he and his Sylvia, his cousin, his
love, his wife, should go for the day to Robin Hood's Bay, returning in
the evening to the house behind the shop in the market-place. There they
were to find Bell Robson installed in her future home; for Haytersbank
Farm was to be given up to the new tenant on the very day of the wedding.
Sylvia would not be married any sooner; she said that she must stay there
till the very last; and had said it with such determination that Philip
had desisted from all urgency at once.</DD>

<DD>
He had told her that all should be settled for her mother's comfort during
their few hours' absence; otherwise Sylvia would not have gone at all.
He told her he should ask Hester, who was always so good and kind--who
never yet had said him nay, to go to church with them as bridesmaid--for
Sylvia would give no thought or care to anything but her mother--and that
they would leave her at Haytersbank as they returned from church; she would
manage Mrs Robson's removal--she would do this--do that--do everything.
Such friendly confidence had Philip in Hester's willingness and tender
skill. Sylvia acquiesced at length, and Philip took upon himself to speak
to Hester on the subject.</DD>

<DD>
'Hester,' said he, one day when he was preparing to go home after the shop
was closed; 'would yo' mind stopping a bit? I should like to show yo' the
place now it's done up; and I've a favour to ask on yo' besides.' He was
so happy he did not see her shiver all over. She hesitated just a moment
before she answered,--</DD>

<DD>
'I'll stay, if thou wishes it, Philip. But I'm no judge o' fashions and
such like.'</DD>

<DD>
'Thou'rt a judge o' comfort, and that's what I've been aiming at. I were
niver so comfortable in a' my life as when I were a lodger at thy house,'
said he, with brotherly tenderness in his tone. 'If my mind had been at
ease I could ha' said I niver were happier in all my days than under thy
roof; and I know it were thy doing for the most part. So come along, Hester,
and tell me if there's aught more I can put in for Sylvie.'</DD>

<DD>
It might not have been a very appropriate text, but such as it was the
words, 'From him that would ask of thee turn not thou away,' seemed the
only source of strength that could have enabled her to go patiently through
the next half-hour. As it was, she unselfishly brought all her mind to
bear upon the subject; admired this, thought and decided upon that, as
one by one Philip showed her all his alterations and improvements. Never
was such a quiet little bit of unconscious and unrecognized heroism. She
really ended by such a conquest of self that she could absolutely sympathize
with the proud expectant lover, and had quenched all envy of the beloved,
in sympathy with the delight she imagined Sylvia must experience when she
discovered all these proofs of Philip's fond consideration and care. But
it was a great strain on the heart, that source of life; and when Hester
returned into the parlour, after her deliberate survey of the house, she
felt as weary and depressed in bodily strength as if she had gone through
an illness of many days. She sate down on the nearest chair, and felt as
though she never could rise again. Philip, joyous and content, stood near
her talking.</DD>

<DD>
'And, Hester,' said he, 'Sylvie has given me a message for thee--she says
thou must be her bridesmaid--she'll have none other.'</DD>

<DD>
'I cannot,' said Hester, with sudden sharpness.</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, yes, but yo' must. It wouldn't be like my wedding if thou wasn't there
why I've looked upon thee as a sister iver since I came to lodge with thy
mother.'</DD>

<DD>
Hester shook her head. Did her duty require her not to turn away from this
asking, too? Philip saw her reluctance, and, by intuition rather than reason,
he knew that what she would not do for gaiety or pleasure she would consent
to if by so doing she could render any service to another. So he went on.</DD>

<DD>
'Besides, Sylvie and me has planned to go for our wedding jaunt t9 Robin
Hood's Bay. I ha' been to engage a shandry this very morn, before t' shop
was opened; and there's no one to leave wi' my aunt. Th' poor old body
is sore crushed with sorrow; and is, as one may say, childish at times;
she's to come down here, that we may find her when we come back at night;
and there's niver a one she'll come with so willing and so happy as with
thee, Hester. Sylvie and me has both said so.'</DD>

<DD>
Hester looked up in his face with her grave honest eyes.</DD>

<DD>
'I cannot go to church wi' thee, Philip; and thou must not ask me any further.
But I'll go betimes to Haytersbank Farm, and I'll do my best to make the
old lady happy, and to follow out thy directions in bringing her here before
nightfall.'</DD>

<DD>
Philip was on the point of urging her afresh to go with them to church;
but something in her eyes brought a thought across his mind, as transitory
as a breath passes over a looking-glass, and he desisted from his entreaty,
and put away his thought as a piece of vain coxcombry, insulting to Hester.
He passed rapidly on to all the careful directions rendered necessary by
her compliance with the latter part of his request, coupling Sylvia's name
with his perpetually; so that Hester looked upon her as a happy girl, as
eager in planning all the details of her marriage as though no heavy shameful
sorrow had passed over her head not many months ago.</DD>

<DD>
Hester did not see Sylvia's white, dreamy, resolute face, that answered
the solemn questions of the marriage service in a voice that did not seem
her own. Hester was not with them to notice the heavy abstraction that
made the bride as if unconscious of her husband's loving words, and then
start and smile, and reply with a sad gentleness of tone. No! Hester's
duty lay in conveying the poor widow and mother down from Haytersbank to
the new home in Monkshaven; and for all Hester's assistance and thoughtfulness,
it was a dreary, painful piece of work--the poor old woman crying like
a child, with bewilderment at the confused bustle which, in spite of all
Sylvia's careful forethought, could not be avoided on this final day, when
her mother had to be carried away from the homestead over which she had
so long presided. But all this was as nothing to the distress which overwhelmed
poor Bell Robson when she entered Philip's house; the parlour--the whole
place so associated with the keen agony she had undergone there, that the
stab of memory penetrated through her deadened senses, and brought her
back to misery. In vain Hester tried to console her by telling her the
fact of Sylvia's marriage with Philip in every form of words that occurred
to her. Bell only remembered her husband's fate, which filled up her poor
wandering mind, and coloured everything; insomuch that Sylvia not being
at hand to reply to her mother's cry for her, the latter imagined that
her child, as well as her husband, was in danger of trial and death, and
refused to be comforted by any endeavour of the patient sympathizing Hester.
In a pause of Mrs Robson's sobs, Hester heard the welcome sound of the
wheels of the returning shandry, bearing the bride and bridegroom home.
It stopped at the door--an instant, and Sylvia, white as a sheet at the
sound of her mother's wailings, which she had caught while yet at a distance,
with the quick ears of love, came running in; her mother feebly rose and
tottered towards her, and fell into her arms, saying, 'Oh! Sylvie, Sylvie,
take me home, and away from this cruel place!'</DD>

<DD>
Hester could not but be touched with the young girl's manner to her mother--as
tender, as protecting as if their relation to each other had been reversed,
and she was lulling and tenderly soothing a wayward, frightened child.
She had neither eyes nor ears for any one till her mother was sitting in
trembling peace, holding her daughter's hand tight in both of hers, as
if afraid of losing sight of her then Sylvia turned to Hester, and, with
the sweet grace which is a natural gift to some happy people, thanked her;
in common words enough she thanked her, but in that nameless manner, and
with that strange, rare charm which made Hester feel as if she had never
been thanked in all her life before; and from that time forth she understood,
if she did not always yield to, the unconscious fascination which Sylvia
could exercise over others at times.</DD>

<DD>
Did it enter into Philip's heart to perceive that he had wedded his long-sought
bride in mourning raiment, and that the first sounds which greeted them
as they approached their home were those of weeping and wailing?</DD>
