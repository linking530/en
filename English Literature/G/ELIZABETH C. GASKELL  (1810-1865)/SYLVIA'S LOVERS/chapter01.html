MONKSHAVEN</H4></CENTER>

<DL>
<DD>
On the north-eastern shores of England there is a town called Monkshaven,
containing at thepresent day about fifteen thousand inhabitants. There
were, however, but half the number at theend of the last century, and it
was at that period that the events narrated in the following pagesoccurred.</DD>

<DD>
Monkshaven was a name not unknown in the history of England, and traditions
of its having beenthe landing-place of a throneless queen were current
in the town. At that time there had been afortified castle on the heights
above it, the site of which was now occupied by a desertedmanor-house;
and at an even earlier date than the arrival of the queen, and coeval with
the mostancient remains of the castle, a great monastery had stood on those
cliffs, overlooking the vastocean that blended with the distant sky. Monkshaven
itself was built by the side of the Dee, justwhere the river falls into
the German Ocean. The principal street of the town ran parallel to thestream,
and smaller lanes branched out of this, and straggled up the sides of the
steep hill, betweenwhich and the river the houses were pent in. There was
a bridge across the Dee, and consequentlya Bridge Street running at right
angles to the High Street; and on the south side of the stream therewere
a few houses of more pretension, around which lay gardens and fields. It
was on this side ofthe town that the local aristocracy lived. And who were
the great people of this small town? Not theyounger branches of the county
families that held hereditary state in their manor-houses on the wildbleak
moors, that shut in Monkshaven almost as effectually on the land side as
ever the waters didon the sea-board. No; these old families kept aloof
from the unsavoury yet adventurous tradewhich brought wealth to generation
after generation of certain families in Monkshaven.</DD>

<DD>
The magnates of Monkshaven were those who had the largest number of ships
engaged in thewhaling-trade. Something like the following was the course
of life with a Monkshaven lad of thisclass:--He was apprenticed as a sailor
to one of the great shipowners--to his own father, possibly--along with
twenty other boys, or, it might be, even more. During the summer months
he and hisfellow apprentices made voyages to the Greenland seas, returning
with their cargoes in the earlyautumn; and employing the winter months
in watching the preparation of the oil from the blubber inthe melting-sheds,
and learning navigation from some quaint but experienced teacher, halfschoolmaster,
half sailor, who seasoned his instructions by stirring narrations of the
wildadventures of his youth. The house of the shipowner to whom he was
apprenticed was his homeand that of his companions during the idle season
between October and March. The domesticposition of these boys varied according
to the premium paid; some took rank with the sons of thefamily, others
were considered as little better than servants. Yet once on board an equalityprevailed,
in which, if any claimed superiority, it was the bravest and brightest.
After a certainnumber of voyages the Monkshaven lad would rise by degrees
to be captain, and as such wouldhave a share in the venture; all these
profits, as well as all his savings, would go towards building awhaling
vessel of his own, if he was not so fortunate as to be the child of a shipowner.
At the timeof which I write, there was but little division of labour in
the Monkshaven whale fishery. The sameman might be the owner of six or
seven ships, any one of which he himself was fitted by educationand experience
to command; the master of a score of apprentices, each of whom paid a prettysufficient
premium; and the proprietor of the melting-sheds into which his cargoes
of blubber andwhalebone were conveyed to be fitted for sale. It was no
wonder that large fortunes were acquiredby these shipowners, nor that their
houses on the south side of the river Dee were statelymansions, full of
handsome and substantial furniture. It was also not surprising that the
wholetown had an amphibious appearance, to a degree unusual even in a seaport.
Every one depended onthe whale fishery, and almost every male Inhabitant
had been, or hoped to be, a sailor. Downby the river the smell was almost
intolerable to any but Monkshaven people during certain seasonsof the year;
but on these unsavoury 'staithes' the old men and children lounged for
hours, almostas if they revelled in the odours of train-oil.</DD>

<DD>
This is, perhaps, enough of a description of the town itself. I have said
that the country for milesall around was moorland; high above the level
of the sea towered the purple crags, whose summitswere crowned with greensward
that stole down the sides of the scaur a little way in grassy veins.Here
and there a brook forced its way from the heights down to the sea, making
its channel into avalley more or less broad in long process of time. And
in the moorland hollows, as in thesevalleys, trees and underwood grew and
flourished; so that, while on the bare swells of the highland you shivered
at the waste desolation of the scenery, when you dropped into these wooded'bottoms'
you were charmed with the nestling shelter which they gave. But above and
around theserare and fertile vales there were moors for many a mile, here
and there bleak enough, with the redfreestone cropping out above the scanty
herbage; then, perhaps, there was a brown tract of peat andbog, uncertain
footing for the pedestrian who tried to make a short cut to his destination;
then onthe higher sandy soil there was the purple ling, or commonest species
of heather growing inbeautiful wild luxuriance. Tuffs of fine elastic grass
were occasionally to be found, on which thelittle black-faced sheep browsed;
but either the scanty food, or their goat-like agility, kept them in alean
condition that did not promise much for the butcher, nor yet was their
wool of a quality fineenough to make them profitable in that way to their
owners. In such districts there is littlepopulation at the present day;
there was much less in the last century, before agriculture wassufficiently
scientific to have a chance of contending with such natural disqualifications
as themoors presented, and when there were no facilities of railroads to
bring sportsmen from a distanceto enjoy the shooting season, and make an
annual demand for accommodation.</DD>

<DD>
There were old stone halls in the valleys; there were bare farmhouses to
be seen on the moors atlong distances apart, with small stacks of coarse
poor hay, and almost larger stacks of turf forwinter fuel in their farmyards.
The cattle in the pasture fields belonging to these farms looked halfstarved;
but somehow there was an odd, intelligent expression in their faces, as
well as in those ofthe black-visaged sheep, which is seldom seen in the
placidly stupid countenances of well-fedanimals. All the fences were turf
banks, with loose stones piled into walls on the top of these.</DD>

<DD>
There was comparative fertility and luxuriance down below in the rare green
dales. The narrowmeadows stretching along the brookside seemed as though
the cows could really satisfy theirhunger in the deep rich grass; whereas
on the higher lands the scanty herbage was hardly worth thefatigue of moving
about in search of it. Even in these 'bottoms' the piping sea-winds, followingthe
current of the stream, stunted and cut low any trees; but still there was
rich thick underwood,tangled and tied together with brambles, and brier-rose,
[sic] and honeysuckle; and if the farmer inthese comparatively happy valleys
had had wife or daughter who cared for gardening, many aflower would have
grown on the western or southern side of the rough stone house. But at
thattime gardening was not a popular art in any part of England; in the
north it is not yet. Noblemenand gentlemen may have beautiful gardens;
but farmers and day-labourers care little for them northof the Trent, which
is all I can answer for. A few 'berry' bushes, a black currant tree or
two (theleaves to be used in heightening the flavour of tea, the fruit
as medicinal for colds and sore throats),a potato ground (and this was
not so common at the close of the last century as it is now), acabbage
bed, a bush of sage, and balm, and thyme, and marjoram, with possibly a
rose tree, and'old man' growing in the midst; a little plot of small strong
coarse onions, and perhaps somemarigolds, the petals of which flavoured
the salt-beef broth; such plants made up a well-furnishedgarden to a farmhouse
at the time and place to which my story belongs. But for twenty miles inlandthere
was no forgetting the sea, nor the sea-trade; refuse shell-fish, seaweed,
the offal of themelting-houses, were the staple manure of the district;
great ghastly whale-jaws, bleached bare andwhite, were the arches over
the gate-posts to many a field or moorland stretch. Out of every familyof
several sons, however agricultural their position might be, one had gone
to sea, and the motherlooked wistfully seaward at the changes of the keep
piping moorland winds. The holiday rambleswere to the coast; no one cared
to go inland to see aught, unless indeed it might be to the greatannual
horse-fairs held where the dreary land broke into habitation and cultivation.</DD>

<DD>
Somehow in this country sea thoughts followed the thinker far inland; whereas
in most other partsof the island, at five miles from the ocean, he has
all but forgotten the existence of such an elementas salt water. The great
Greenland trade of the coasting towns was the main and primary cause ofthis,
no doubt. But there was also a dread and an irritation in every one's mind,
at the time ofwhich I write, in connection with the neighbouring sea.</DD>

<DD>
Since the termination of the American war, there had been nothing to call
for any unusual energy inmanning the navy; and the grants required by Government
for this purpose diminished with everyyear of peace. In 1792 this grant
touched its minimum for many years. In 1793 the proceedings ofthe French
had set Europe on fire, and the English were raging with anti-Gallican
excitement,fomented into action by every expedient of the Crown and its
Ministers. We had our ships; butwhere were our men? The Admiralty had,
however, a ready remedy at hand, with ample precedentfor its use, and with
common (if not statute) law to sanction its application. They issued 'presswarrants,'
calling upon the civil power throughout the country to support their officers
in thedischarge of their duty. The sea-coast was divided into districts,
under the charge of a captain in thenavy, who again delegated sub-districts
to lieutenants; and in this manner all homeward-boundvessels were watched
and waited for, all ports were under supervision; and in a day, if need
were,a large number of men could be added to the forces of his Majesty's
navy. But if the Admiraltybecame urgent in their demands, they were also
willing to be unscrupulous. Landsmen, ifable-bodied, might soon be trained
into good sailors; and once in the hold of the tender, whichalways awaited
the success of the operations of the press-gang, it was difficult for such
prisonersto bring evidence of the nature of their former occupations, especially
when none had leisure tolisten to such evidence, or were willing to believe
it if they did listen, or would act upon it for therelease of the captive
if they had by possibility both listened and believed. Men were kidnapped,literally
disappeared, and nothing was ever heard of them again. The street of a
busy town was notsafe from such press-gang captures, as Lord Thurlow could
have told, after a certain walk he tookabout this time on Tower Hill, when
he, the attorney-general of England, was impressed, when theAdmiralty had
its own peculiar ways of getting rid of tiresome besiegers and petitioners.
Nor yetwere lonely inland dwellers more secure; many a rustic went to a
statute fair or 'mop,' and nevercame home to tell of his hiring; many a
stout young farmer vanished from his place by the hearth ofhis father,
and was no more heard of by mother or lover; so great was the press for
men to serve inthe navy during the early years of the war with France,
and after every great naval victory of thatwar.</DD>

<DD>
The servants of the Admiralty lay in wait for all merchantmen and traders;
there were manyinstances of vessels returning home after long absence,
and laden with rich cargo, being boardedwithin a day's distance of land,
and so many men pressed and carried off, that the ship, with hercargo,
became unmanageable from the loss of her crew, drifted out again into the
wild wide ocean,and was sometimes found in the helpless guidance of one
or two infirm or ignorant sailors;sometimes such vessels were never heard
of more. The men thus pressed were taken from the neargrasp of parents
or wives, and were often deprived of the hard earnings of years, which
remainedin the hands of the masters of the merchantman in which they had
served, subject to all the chancesof honesty or dishonesty, life or death.
Now all this tyranny (for I can use no other word) ismarvellous to us;
we cannot imagine how it is that a nation submitted to it for so long,
even underany warlike enthusiasm, any panics of invasion, any amount of
loyal subservience to the governingpowers. When we read of the military
being called in to assist the civil power in backing up thepress-gang,
of parties of soldiers patrolling the streets, and sentries with screwed
bayonets placedat every door while the press-gang entered and searched
each hole and corner of the dwelling;when we hear of churches being surrounded
during divine service by troops, while the press-gangstood ready at the
door to seize men as they came out from attending public worship, and take
theseinstances as merely types of what was constantly going on in different
forms, we do not wonder atLord Mayors, and other civic authorities in large
towns, complaining that a stop was put tobusiness by the danger which the
tradesmen and their servants incurred in leaving their houses andgoing
into the streets, infested by press-gangs.</DD>

<DD>
Whether it was that living in closer neighbourhood to the metropolis--the
centre of politics andnews--inspired the inhabitants of the southern counties
with a strong feeling of that kind ofpatriotism which consists in hating
all other nations; or whether it was that the chances of capturewere so
much greater at all the southern ports that the merchant sailors became
inured to the danger;or whether it was that serving in the navy, to those
familiar with such towns as Portsmouth andPlymouth, had an attraction to
most men from the dash and brilliancy of the adventurousemployment--it
is certain that the southerners took the oppression of press-warrants moresubmissively
than the wild north-eastern people. For with them the chances of profit
beyond theirwages in the whaling or Greenland trade extended to the lowest
description of sailor. He might riseby daring and saving to be a shipowner
himself. Numbers around him had done so; and this veryfact made the distinction
between class and class less apparent; and the common ventures anddangers,
the universal interest felt in one pursuit, bound the inhabitants of that
line of coast togetherwith a strong tie, the severance of which by any
violent extraneous measure, gave rise topassionate anger and thirst for
vengeance. A Yorkshireman once said to me, 'My county folk areall alike.
Their first thought is how to resist. Why ! I myself, if I hear a man say
it is a fine day,catch myself trying to find out that it is no such thing.
It is so in thought; it is so in word; it is so indeed.'</DD>

<DD>
So you may imagine the press-gang had no easy time of it on the Yorkshire
coast. In other placesthey inspired fear, but here rage and hatred. The
Lord Mayor of York was warned on 20thJanuary, 1777, by an anonymous letter,
that 'if those men were not sent from the city on or beforethe following
Tuesday, his lordship's own dwelling, and the Mansion-house also, should
beburned to the ground.'</DD>

<DD>
Perhaps something of the ill-feeling that prevailed on the subject was
owing to the fact which Ihave noticed in other places similarly situated.
Where the landed possessions of gentlemen ofancient family but limited
income surround a centre of any kind of profitable trade or manufacture,there
is a sort of latent ill-will on the part of the squires to the tradesman,
be he manufacturer,merchant, or shipowner, in whose hands is held a power
of money-making, which no hereditarypride, or gentlemanly love of doing
nothing, prevents him from using. This ill-will, to be sure, ismostly of
a negative kind; its most common form of manifestation is in absence of
speech oraction, a sort of torpid and genteel ignoring all unpleasant neighbours;
but really the whale-fisheriesof Monkshaven had become so impertinently
and obtrusively prosperous of late years at the time ofwhich I write, the
Monkshaven shipowners were growing so wealthy and consequential, that thesquires,
who lived at home at ease in the old stone manor-houses scattered up and
down thesurrounding moorland, felt that the check upon the Monkshaven trade
likely to be inflicted by thepress-gang, was wisely ordained by the higher
powers (how high they placed these powers I willnot venture to say), to
prevent overhaste in getting rich, which was a scriptural fault, and they
alsothought that they were only doing their duty in backing up the Admiralty
warrants by all the civilpower at their disposal, whenever they were called
upon, and whenever they could do sowithout taking too much trouble in affairs
which did not after all much concern themselves.</DD>

<DD>
There was just another motive in the minds of some provident parents of
many daughters. Thecaptains and lieutenants employed on this service were
mostly agreeable bachelors, brought up to agenteel profession, at the least
they were very pleasant visitors, when they had a day to spare; whoknew
what might come of it?</DD>

<DD>
Indeed, these brave officers were not unpopular in Monkshaven itself, except
at the time when theywere brought into actual collision with the people.
They had the frank manners of their profession;they were known to have
served in those engagements, the very narrative of which at this day willwarm
the heart of a quaker, and they themselves did not come prominently forward
in the dirtywork which, nevertheless, was permitted and quietly sanctioned
by them. So while fewMonkshaven people passed the low public-house over
which the navy blue-flag streamed, as a signthat it was the rendezvous
of the press-gang, without spitting towards it in sign of abhorrence, yet,perhaps,
the very same persons would give some rough token of respect to Lieutenant
Atkinson ifthey met him in High Street. Touching their hats was an unknown
gesture in those parts, but theywould move their heads in a droll, familiar
kind of way, neither a wag nor a nod, but meant all thesame to imply friendly
regard. The shipowners, too, invited him to an occasional dinner or supper,all
the time looking forward to the chances of his turning out an active enemy,
and not by anymeans inclined to give him 'the run of the house,' however
many unmarried daughters might gracetheir table. Still as he could tell
a rattling story, drink hard, and was seldom too busy to come at ashort
notice, he got on better than any one could have expected with the Monkshaven
folk. And theprincipal share of the odium of his business fell on his subordinates,
who were one and allregarded in the light of mean kidnappers and spies--'varmint,'
as the common people esteemedthem: and as such they were ready at the first
provocation to hunt and to worry them, and littlecared the press-gang for
this. Whatever else they were, they were brave and daring. They had lawto
back them, therefore their business was lawful. They were serving their
king and country. Theywere using all their faculties, and that is always
pleasant. There was plenty of scope for the gloryand triumph of outwitting;
plenty of adventure in their life. It was a lawful and loyal employment,requiring
sense, readiness, courage, and besides it called out that strange love
of the chase inherentin every man. Fourteen or fifteen miles at sea lay
the <I>Aurora</I>, good man-of-war; and to her wereconveyed the living
cargoes of several tenders, which were stationed at likely places along
thesea-coast. One, the <I>Lively Lady</I>, might be seen from the cliffs
above Monkshaven, not so faraway, but hidden by the angle of the high lands
from the constant sight of the townspeople; andthere was always the Randyvow-house
(as the public-house with the navy blue-flag was calledthereabouts) for
the crew of the <I>Lively Lady</I> to lounge about, and there to offer
drink to unwarypassers-by. At present this was all that the press-gang
had done at Monkshaven.</DD>
