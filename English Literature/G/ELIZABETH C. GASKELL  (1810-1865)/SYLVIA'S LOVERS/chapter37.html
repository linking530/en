Hester had been prevented by her mother's indisposition from taking Philip's
letter to the Fosters, to hold a consultation with them over its contents.

<P>Alice Rose was slowly failing, and the long days which she had to spend
alone told much upon her spirits, and consequently upon her health.

<P>All this came out in the conversation which ensued after reading Hepburn's
letter in the little parlour at the bank on the day after Sylvia had had
her confidential interview with Jeremiah Foster.

<P>He was a true man of honour, and never so much as alluded to her visit
to him; but what she had then told him influenced him very much in the
formation of the project which he proposed to his brother and Hester.

<P>He recommended her remaining where she was, living still in the house
behind the shop; for he thought within himself that she might have exaggerated
the effect of her words upon Philip; that, after all, it might have been
some cause totally disconnected with them, which had blotted out her husband's
place among the men of Monkshaven; and that it would be so much easier
for both to resume their natural relations, both towards each other and
towards the world, if Sylvia remained where her husband had left her--in
an expectant attitude, so to speak.

<P>Jeremiah Foster questioned Hester straitly about her letter: whether
she had made known its contents to any one. No, not to any one. Neither
to her mother nor to William Coulson? No, to neither.

<P>She looked at him as she replied to his inquiries, and he looked at
her, each wondering if the other could be in the least aware that a conjugal
quarrel might be at the root of the dilemma in which they were placed by
Hepburn's disappearance.

<P>But neither Hester, who had witnessed the misunderstanding between the
husband and wife on the evening, before the morning on which Philip went
away, nor Jeremiah Foster, who had learnt from Sylvia the true reason of
her husband's disappearance, gave the slightest reason to the other to
think that they each supposed they had a clue to the reason of Hepburn's
sudden departure.

<P>What Jeremiah Foster, after a night's consideration, had to propose
was this; that Hester and her mother should come and occupy the house in
the market-place, conjointly with Sylvia and her child. Hester's interest
in the shop was by this time acknowledged. Jeremiah had made over to her
so much of his share in the business, that she had a right to be considered
as a kind of partner; and she had long been the superintendent of that
department of goods which were exclusively devoted to women. So her daily
presence was requisite for more reasons than one.

<P>Yet her mother's health and spirits were such as to render it unadvisable
that the old woman should be too much left alone; and Sylvia's devotion
to her own mother seemed to point her out as the very person who could
be a gentle and tender companion to Alice Rose during those hours when
her own daughter would necessarily be engaged in the shop.

<P>Many desirable objects seemed to be gained by this removal of Alice:
an occupation was provided for Sylvia, which would detain her in the place
where her husband had left her, and where (Jeremiah Foster fairly expected
in spite of his letter) he was likely to come back to find her; and Alice
Rose, the early love of one of the brothers, the old friend of the other,
would be well cared for, and under her daughter's immediate supervision
during the whole of the time that she was occupied in the shop.

<P>Philip's share of the business, augmented by the money which he had
put in from the legacy of his old Cumberland uncle, would bring in profits
enough to support Sylvia and her child in ease and comfort until that time,
which they all anticipated, when he should return from his mysterious wandering--mysterious,
whether his going forth had been voluntary or involuntary.

<P>Thus far was settled; and Jeremiah Foster went to tell Sylvia of the
plan.

<P>She was too much a child, too entirely unaccustomed to any independence
of action, to do anything but leave herself in his hands. Her very confession,
made to him the day before, when she sought his counsel, seemed to place
her at his disposal. Otherwise, she had had notions of the possibility
of a free country life once more--how provided for and arranged she hardly
knew; but Haytersbank was to let, and Kester disengaged, and it had just
seemed possible that she might have to return to her early home, and to
her old life. She knew that it would take much money to stock the farm
again, and that her hands were tied from much useful activity by the love
and care she owed to her baby. But still, somehow, she hoped and she fancied,
till Jeremiah Foster's measured words and carefully-arranged plan made
her silently relinquish her green, breezy vision.

<P>Hester, too, had her own private rebellion--hushed into submission by
her gentle piety. If Sylvia had been able to make Philip happy, Hester
could have felt lovingly and almost gratefully towards her; but Sylvia
had failed in this.

<P>Philip had been made unhappy, and was driven forth a wanderer into the
wide world--never to come back! And his last words to Hester, the postscript
of his letter, containing the very pith of it, was to ask her to take charge
and care of the wife whose want of love towards him had uprooted him from
the place where he was valued and honoured.

<P>It cost Hester many a struggle and many a self-reproach before she could
make herself feel what she saw all along--that in everything Philip treated
her like a sister. But even a sister might well be indignant if she saw
her brother's love disregarded and slighted, and his life embittered by
the thoughtless conduct of a wife! Still Hester fought against herself,
and for Philip's sake she sought to see the good in Sylvia, and she strove
to love her as well as to take care of her.

<P>With the baby, of course, the case was different. Without thought or
struggle, or reason, every one loved the little girl. Coulson and his buxom
wife, who were childless, were never weary of making much of her. Hester's
happiest hours were spent with that little child. Jeremiah Foster almost
looked upon her as his own from the day when she honoured him by yielding
to the temptation of the chain and seal, and coming to his knee; not a
customer to the shop but knew the smiling child's sad history, and many
a country-woman would save a rosy-cheeked apple from out her store that
autumn to bring it on next market-day for 'Philip Hepburn's baby, as had
lost its father, bless it.'

<P>Even stern Alice Rose was graciously inclined towards the little Bella;
and though her idea of the number of the elect was growing narrower and
narrower every day, she would have been loth to exclude the innocent little
child, that stroked her wrinkled cheeks so softly every night in return
for her blessing, from the few that should be saved. Nay, for the child's
sake, she relented towards the mother; and strove to have Sylvia rescued
from the many castaways with fervent prayer, or, as she phrased it, 'wrestling
with the Lord.'

<P>Alice had a sort of instinct that the little child, so tenderly loved
by, so fondly loving, the mother whose ewe-lamb she was, could not be even
in heaven without yearning for the creature she had loved best on earth;
and the old woman believed that this was the principal reason for her prayers
for Sylvia; but unconsciously to herself, Alice Rose was touched by the
filial attentions she constantly received from the young mother, whom she
believed to be foredoomed to condemnation.

<P>Sylvia rarely went to church or chapel, nor did she read her Bible;
for though she spoke little of her ignorance, and would fain, for her child's
sake, have remedied it now it was too late, she had lost what little fluency
of reading she had ever had, and could only make out her words with much
spelling and difficulty. So the taking her Bible in hand would have been
a mere form; though of this Alice Rose knew nothing.

<P>No one knew much of what was passing in Sylvia; she did not know herself.
Sometimes in the nights she would waken, crying, with a terrible sense
of desolation; every one who loved her, or whom she had loved, had vanished
out of her life; every one but her child, who lay in her arms, warm and
soft.

<P>But then Jeremiah Foster's words came upon her; words that she had taken
for cursing at the time; and she would so gladly have had some clue by
which to penetrate the darkness of the unknown region from whence both
blessing and cursing came, and to know if she had indeed done something
which should cause her sin to be visited on that soft, sweet, innocent
darling.

<P>If any one would teach her to read! If any one would explain to her
the hard words she heard in church or chapel, so that she might find out
the meaning of sin and godliness!--words that had only passed over the
surface of her mind till now! For her child's sake she should like to do
the will of God, if she only knew what that was, and how to be worked out
in her daily life.

<P>But there was no one she dared confess her ignorance to and ask information
from. Jeremiah Foster had spoken as if her child, sweet little merry Bella,
with a loving word and a kiss for every one, was to suffer heavily for
the just and true words her wronged and indignant mother had spoken. Alice
always spoke as if there were no hope for her; and blamed her, nevertheless,
for not using the means of grace that it was not in her power to avail
herself of.

<P>And Hester, that Sylvia would fain have loved for her uniform gentleness
and patience with all around her, seemed so cold in her unruffled and undemonstrative
behaviour; and moreover, Sylvia felt that Hester blamed her perpetual silence
regarding Philip's absence without knowing how bitter a cause Sylvia had
for casting him off.

<P>The only person who seemed to have pity upon her was Kester; and his
pity was shown in looks rather than words; for when he came to see her,
which he did from time to time, by a kind of mutual tacit consent, they
spoke but little of former days.

<P>He was still lodging with his sister, widow Moore, working at odd jobs,
some of which took him into the country for weeks at a time. But on his
returns to Monkshaven he was sure to come and see her and the little Bella;
indeed, when his employment was in the immediate neighbourhood of the town,
he never allowed a week to pass away without a visit.

<P>There was not much conversation between him and Sylvia at such times.
They skimmed over the surface of the small events in which both took an
interest; only now and then a sudden glance, a checked speech, told each
that there were deeps not forgotten, although they were never mentioned.

<P>Twice Sylvia--below her breath--had asked Kester, just as she was holding
the door open for his departure, if anything had ever been heard of Kinraid
since his one night's visit to Monkshaven: each time (and there was an
interval of some months between the inquiries) the answer had been simply,
no.

<P>To no one else would Sylvia ever have named his name. But indeed she
had not the chance, had she wished it ever so much, of asking any questions
about him from any one likely to know. The Corneys had left Moss Brow at
Martinmas, and gone many miles away towards Horncastle. Bessy Corney, it
is true was married and left behind in the neighbourhood; but with her
Sylvia had never been intimate; and what girlish friendship there might
have been between them had cooled very much at the time of Kinraid's supposed
death three years before.

<P>One day before Christmas in this year, 1798, Sylvia was called into
the shop by Coulson, who, with his assistant was busy undoing the bales
of winter goods supplied to them from the West Riding, and other places.
He was looking at a fine Irish poplin dress-piece when Sylvia answered
to his call.

<P>'Here! do you know this again?' asked he, in the cheerful tone of one
sure of giving pleasure.

<P>'No! have I iver seen it afore?'

<P>'Not this, but one for all t' world like it.'

<P>She did not rouse up to much interest, but looked at it as if trying
to recollect where she could have seen its like.

<P>'My missus had one on at th' party at John Foster's last March, and
yo' admired it a deal. And Philip, he thought o' nothing but how he could
get yo' just such another, and he set a vast o' folk agait for to meet
wi' its marrow; and what he did just the very day afore he went away so
mysterious was to write through Dawson Brothers, o' Wakefield, to Dublin,
and order that one should be woven for yo'. Jemima had to cut a bit off
hers for to give him t' exact colour.'

<P>Sylvia did not say anything but that it was very pretty, in a low voice,
and then she quickly left the shop, much to Coulson's displeasure.

<P>All the afternoon she was unusually quiet and depressed.

<P>Alice Rose, sitting helpless in her chair, watched her with keen eyes.

<P>At length, after one of Sylvia's deep, unconscious sighs, the old woman
spoke:

<P>'It's religion as must comfort thee, child, as it's done many a one
afore thee.'

<P>'How?' said Sylvia, looking up, startled to find herself an object of
notice.

<P>'How?' (The answer was not quite so ready as the precept had been.)
'Read thy Bible, and thou wilt learn.'

<P>'But I cannot read,' said Sylvia, too desperate any longer to conceal
her ignorance.

<P>'Not read! and thee Philip's wife as was such a great scholar! Of a
surety the ways o' this life are crooked! There was our Hester, as can
read as well as any minister, and Philip passes over her to go and choose
a young lass as cannot read her Bible.'

<P>'Was Philip and Hester----'

<P>Sylvia paused, for though a new curiosity had dawned upon her, she did
not know how to word her question.

<P>'Many a time and oft have I seen Hester take comfort in her Bible when
Philip was following after thee. She knew where to go for consolation.'

<P>'I'd fain read,' said Sylvia, humbly, 'if anybody would learn me; for
perhaps it might do me good; I'm noane so happy.'

<P>Her eyes, as she looked up at Alice's stern countenance, were full of
tears.

<P>The old woman saw it, and was touched, although she did not immediately
show her sympathy. But she took her own time, and made no reply.

<P>The next day, however, she bade Sylvia come to her, and then and there,
as if her pupil had been a little child, she began to teach Sylvia to read
the first chapter of Genesis; for all other reading but the Scriptures
was as vanity to her, and she would not condescend to the weakness of other
books. Sylvia was now, as ever, slow at book-learning; but she was meek
and desirous to be taught, and her willingness in this respect pleased
Alice, and drew her singularly towards one who, from being a pupil, might
become a convert.

<P>All this time Sylvia never lost the curiosity that had been excited
by the few words Alice had let drop about Hester and Philip, and by degrees
she approached the subject again, and had the idea then started confirmed
by Alice, who had no scruple in using the past experience of her own, of
her daughter's, or of any one's life, as an instrument to prove the vanity
of setting the heart on anything earthly.

<P>This knowledge, unsuspected before, sank deep into Sylvia's thoughts,
and gave her a strange interest in Hester--poor Hester, whose life she
had so crossed and blighted, even by the very blighting of her own. She
gave Hester her own former passionate feelings for Kinraid, and wondered
how she herself should have felt towards any one who had come between her
and him, and wiled his love away. When she remembered Hester's unfailing
sweetness and kindness towards herself from the very first, she could better
bear the comparative coldness of her present behaviour.

<P>She tried, indeed, hard to win back the favour she had lost; but the
very means she took were blunders, and only made it seem to her as if she
could never again do right in Hester's eyes.

<P>For instance, she begged her to accept and wear the pretty poplin gown
which had been Philip's especial choice; feeling within herself as if she
should never wish to put it on, and as if the best thing she could do with
it was to offer it to Hester. But Hester rejected the proffered gift with
as much hardness of manner as she was capable of assuming; and Sylvia had
to carry it upstairs and lay it by for the little daughter, who, Hester
said, might perhaps learn to value things that her father had given especial
thought to.

<P>Yet Sylvia went on trying to win Hester to like her once more; it was
one of her great labours, and learning to read from Hester's mother was
another.

<P>Alice, indeed, in her solemn way, was becoming quite fond of Sylvia;
if she could not read or write, she had a deftness and gentleness of motion,
a capacity for the household matters which fell into her department, that
had a great effect on the old woman, and for her dear mother's sake Sylvia
had a stock of patient love ready in her heart for all the aged and infirm
that fell in her way. She never thought of seeking them out, as she knew
that Hester did; but then she looked up to Hester as some one very remarkable
for her goodness. If only she could have liked her!

<P>Hester tried to do all she could for Sylvia; Philip had told her to
take care of his wife and child; but she had the conviction that Sylvia
had so materially failed in her duties as to have made her husband an exile
from his home--a penniless wanderer, wifeless and childless, in some strange
country, whose very aspect was friendless, while the cause of all lived
on in the comfortable home where he had placed her, wanting for nothing--an
object of interest and regard to many friends--with a lovely little child
to give her joy for the present, and hope for the future; while he, the
poor outcast, might even lie dead by the wayside. How could Hester love
Sylvia?

<P>Yet they were frequent companions that ensuing spring. Hester was not
well; and the doctors said that the constant occupation in the shop was
too much for her, and that she must, for a time at least, take daily walks
into the country.

<P>Sylvia used to beg to accompany her; she and the little girl often went
with Hester up the valley of the river to some of the nestling farms that
were hidden in the more sheltered nooks--for Hester was bidden to drink
milk warm from the cow; and to go into the familiar haunts about a farm
was one of the few things in which Sylvia seemed to take much pleasure.
She would let little Bella toddle about while Hester sate and rested: and
she herself would beg to milk the cow destined to give the invalid her
draught.

<P>One May evening the three had been out on some such expedition; the
country side still looked gray and bare, though the leaves were showing
on the willow and blackthorn and sloe, and by the tinkling runnels, making
hidden music along the copse side, the pale delicate primrose buds were
showing amid their fresh, green, crinkled leaves. The larks had been singing
all the afternoon, but were now dropping down into their nests in the pasture
fields; the air had just the sharpness in it which goes along with a cloudless
evening sky at that time of the year.

<P>But Hester walked homewards slowly and languidly, speaking no word.
Sylvia noticed this at first without venturing to speak, for Hester was
one who disliked having her ailments noticed. But after a while Hester
stood still in a sort of weary dreamy abstraction; and Sylvia said to her,

<P>'I'm afeared yo're sadly tired. Maybe we've been too far.'

<P>Hester almost started.

<P>'No!' said she, 'it's only my headache which is worse to-night. It has
been bad all day; but since I came out it has felt just as if there were
great guns booming, till I could almost pray 'em to be quiet. I am so weary
o' th' sound.'

<P>She stepped out quickly towards home after she had said this, as if
she wished for neither pity nor comment on what she had said.
