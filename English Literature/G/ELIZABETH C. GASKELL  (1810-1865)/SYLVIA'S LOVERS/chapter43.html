<DD>
A few days before that on which Philip arrived at Monkshaven, Kester had
come to pay Sylvia a visit. As the earliest friend she had, and also as
one who knew the real secrets of her life, Sylvia always gave him the warm
welcome, the cordial words, and the sweet looks in which the old man delighted.
He had a sort of delicacy of his own which kept him from going to see her
too often, even when he was stationary at Monkshaven; but he looked forward
to the times when he allowed himself this pleasure as a child at school
looks forward to its holidays. The time of his service at Haytersbank had,
on the whole, been the happiest in ail his long monotonous years of daily
labour. Sylvia's father had always treated him with the rough kindness
of fellowship; Sylvia's mother had never stinted him in his meat or grudged
him his share of the best that was going; and once, when he was ill for
a few days in the loft above the cow-house, she had made him possets, and
nursed him with the same tenderness which he remembered his mother showing
to him when he was a little child, but which he had never experienced since
then. He had known Sylvia herself, as bud, and sweet promise of blossom;
and just as she was opening into the full-blown rose, and, if she had been
happy and prosperous, might have passed out of the narrow circle of Kester's
interests, one sorrow after another came down upon her pretty innocent
head, and Kester's period of service to Daniel Robson, her father, was
tragically cut short. All this made Sylvia the great centre of the faithful
herdsman's affection; and Bella, who reminded him of what Sylvia was when
first Kester knew her, only occupied the second place in his heart, although
to the child he was much more demonstrative of his regard than to the mother.</DD>

<DD>
He had dressed himself in his Sunday best, and although it was only Thursday,
had forestalled his Saturday's shaving; he had provided himself with a
paper of humbugs for the child--'humbugs' being the north-country term
for certain lumps of toffy, well-flavoured with peppermint--and now he
sat in the accustomed chair, as near to the door as might be, in Sylvia's
presence, coaxing the little one, who was not quite sure of his identity,
t9 come to him, by opening the paper parcel, and letting its sweet contents
be seen.</DD>

<DD>
'She's like thee--and yet she favours her feyther,' said he; and the moment
he had uttered the incautious words he looked up to see how Sylvia had
taken the unpremeditated, unusual reference to her husband. His stealthy
glance did not meet her eye; but though he thought she had coloured a little,
she did not seem offended as he had feared. It was true that Bella had
her father's grave, thoughtful, dark eyes, instead of her mother's grey
ones, out of which the childlike expression of wonder would never entirely
pass away. And as Bella slowly and half distrustfully made her way towards
the temptation offered her, she looked at Kester with just her father's
look.</DD>

<DD>
Sylvia said nothing in direct reply; Kester almost thought she could not
have heard him. But, by-and-by, she said,--</DD>

<DD>
'Yo'll have heared how Kinraid--who's a captain now, and a grand officer--has
gone and got married.'</DD>

<DD>
'Nay!' said Kester, in genuine surprise. 'He niver has, for sure!'</DD>

<DD>
'Ay, but he has,' said Sylvia. 'And I'm sure I dunnot see why he shouldn't.'</DD>

<DD>
'Well, well!' said Kester, not looking up at her, for he caught the inflections
in the tones of her voice. 'He were a fine stirrin' chap, yon; an' he were
allays for doin' summut; an' when he fund as he couldn't ha' one thing
as he'd set his mind on, a reckon he thought he mun put up wi' another.'</DD>

<DD>
'It 'ud be no "putting up,"' said Sylvia. 'She were staying at Bessy Dawson's,
and she come here to see me--she's as pretty a young lady as yo'd see on
a summer's day; and a real lady, too, wi' a fortune. She didn't speak two
words wi'out bringing in her husband's name--"the captain," as she called
him.'</DD>

<DD>
'An' she come to see thee?' said Kester, cocking his eye at Sylvia with
the old shrewd look. 'That were summut queer, weren't it?'</DD>

<DD>
Sylvia reddened a good deal.</DD>

<DD>
'He's too fause to have spoken to her on me, in t' old way,--as he used
for t' speak to me. I were nought to her but Philip's wife.'</DD>

<DD>
'An' what t' dickins had she to do wi' Philip?' asked Kester, in intense
surprise; and so absorbed in curiosity that he let the humbugs all fall
out of the paper upon the floor, and the little Bella sat down, plump,
in the midst of treasures as great as those fabled to exist on Tom Tiddler's
ground.</DD>

<DD>
Sylvia was again silent; but Kester, knowing her well, was sure that she
was struggling to speak, and bided his time without repeating his question.</DD>

<DD>
'She said--and I think her tale were true, though I cannot get to t' rights
on it, think on it as I will--as Philip saved her husband's life somewheere
nearabouts to Jerusalem. She would have it that t' captain--for I think
I'll niver ca' him Kinraid again--was in a great battle, and were near
upon being shot by t' French, when Philip--our Philip--come up and went
right into t' fire o' t' guns, and saved her husband's life. And she spoke
as if both she and t' captain were more beholden to Philip than words could
tell. And she come to see me, to try and get news on him.</DD>

<DD>
'It's a queer kind o' story,' said Kester, meditatively. 'A should ha'
thought as Philip were more likely to ha' gi'en him a shove into t' thick
on it, than t' help him out o' t' scrape.'</DD>

<DD>
'Nay!' said Sylvia, suddenly looking straight at Kester; 'yo're out theere.
Philip had a deal o' good in him. And I dunnot think as he'd ha' gone and
married another woman so soon, if he'd been i' Kinraid's place.'</DD>

<DD>
'An' yo've niver heared on Philip sin' he left?' asked Kester, after a
while.</DD>

<DD>
'Niver; nought but what she told me. And she said that t' captain made
inquiry for him right and left, as soon after that happened as might be,
and could hear niver a word about him. No one had seen him, or knowed his
name.'</DD>

<DD>
'Yo' niver heared of his goin' for t' be a soldier?' persevered Kester.</DD>

<DD>
'Niver. I've told yo' once. It were unlike Philip to think o' such a thing.'</DD>

<DD>
'But thou mun ha' been thinkin' on him at times i' a' these years. Bad
as he'd behaved hissel', he were t' feyther o' thy little un. What did
ta think he had been agait on when he left here?'</DD>

<DD>
'I didn't know. I were noane so keen a-thinking on him at first. I tried
to put him out o' my thoughts. a'together, for it made me like mad to think
how he'd stood between me and--that other. But I'd begun to wonder and
to wonder about him, and to think I should like to hear as he were doing
well. I reckon I thought he were i' London, wheere he'd been that time
afore, yo' know, and had allays spoke as if he'd enjoyed hissel' tolerable;
and then Molly Brunton told me on t' other one's marriage; and, somehow,
it gave me a shake in my heart, and I began for to wish I hadn't said all
them words i' my passion; and then that fine young lady come wi' her story--and
I've thought a deal on it since,--and my mind has come out clear. Philip's
dead, and it were his spirit as come to t' other's help in his time o'
need. I've heard feyther say as spirits cannot rest i' their graves for
trying to undo t' wrongs they've done i' their bodies.'</DD>

<DD>
'Them's my conclusions,' said Kester, solemnly. 'A was fain for to hear
what were yo'r judgments first; but them's the conclusions I comed to as
soon as I heard t' tale.'</DD>

<DD>
'Let alone that one thing,' said Sylvia, 'he were a kind, good man.'</DD>

<DD>
'It were a big deal on a "one thing," though,' said Kester. 'It just spoilt
yo'r life, my poor lass; an' might ha' gone near to spoilin' Charley Kinraid's
too.'</DD>

<DD>
'Men takes a deal more nor women to spoil their lives,' said Sylvia, bitterly.</DD>

<DD>
'Not a' mak' o' men. I reckon, lass, Philip's life were pretty well on
for bein' spoilt at after he left here; and it were mebbe, a good thing
he got rid on it so soon.'</DD>

<DD>
'I wish I'd just had a few kind words wi' him, I do,' said Sylvia, almost
on the point of crying.</DD>

<DD>
'Come, lass, it's as ill moanin' after what's past as it 'ud be for me
t' fill my eyes wi' weepin' after t' humbugs as this little wench o' thine
has grubbed up whilst we'n been talkin'. Why, there's not one on 'em left!'</DD>

<DD>
'She's a sad spoilt little puss!' said Sylvia, holding out her arms to
the child, who ran into them, and began patting her mother's cheeks, and
pulling at the soft brown curls tucked away beneath the matronly cap. 'Mammy
spoils her, and Hester spoils her----'</DD>

<DD>
'Granny Rose doesn't spoil me,' said the child, with quick, intelligent
discrimination, interrupting her mother's list.</DD>

<DD>
'No; but Jeremiah Foster does above a bit. He'll come in fro' t' Bank,
Kester, and ask for her, a'most ivery day. And he'll bring her things in
his pocket; and she's so fause, she allays goes straight to peep in, and
then he shifts t' apple or t' toy into another. Eh! but she's a little
fause one,'--half devouring the child with her kisses. 'And he comes and
takes her a walk oftentimes, an d he goes as slow as if he were quite an
old man, to keep pace wi' Bella's steps. I often run upstairs and watch
'em out o' t' window; he doesn't care to have me with 'em, he's so fain
t' have t' child all to hisself.'</DD>

<DD>
'She's a bonny un, for sure,' said Kester; 'but not so pretty as thou was,
Sylvie. A've niver tell'd thee what a come for tho', and it's about time
for me t' be goin'. A'm off to t' Cheviots to-morrow morn t' fetch home
some sheep as Jonas Blundell has purchased. It'll be a job o' better nor
two months a reckon.'</DD>

<DD>
'It'll be a nice time o' year,' said Sylvia, a little surprised at Kester's
evident discouragement at the prospect of the journey or absence; he had
often been away from Monks-haven for a longer time without seeming to care
so much about it.</DD>

<DD>
'Well, yo' see it's a bit hard upon me for t' leave my sister she as is
t' widow-woman, wheere a put up when a'm at home. Things is main an' dear;
four-pound loaves is at sixteenpence; an' there's a deal o' talk on a famine
i' t' land; an' whaten a paid for my victual an' t' bed i' t' lean-to helped
t' oud woman a bit,--an' she's sadly down i' t' mouth, for she cannot hear
on a lodger for t' tak' my place, for a' she's moved o'er to t' other side
o' t' bridge for t' be nearer t' new buildings, an' t' grand new walk they're
makin' round t' cliffs thinkin' she'd be likelier t' pick up a labourer
as would be glad on a bed near his work. A'd ha' liked to ha' set her agait
wi' a 'sponsible lodger afore a'd ha' left, for she's just so soft-hearted,
any scamp may put upon her if he nobbut gets houd on her blind side.'</DD>

<DD>
'Can I help her?' said Sylvia, in her eager way. 'I should be so glad;
and I've a deal of money by me----'</DD>

<DD>
'Nay, my lass,' said Kester, 'thou munnot go off so fast; it were just
what I were feared on i' tellin' thee. I've left her a bit o' money, and
I'll mak' shift to send her more; it's just a kind word, t' keep up her
heart when I'm gone, as I want. If thou'd step in and see her fra' time
to time, and cheer her up a bit wi' talkin' to her on me, I'd tak' it very
kind, and I'd go off wi' a lighter heart.'</DD>

<DD>
'Then I'm sure I'll do it for yo', Kester. I niver justly feel like mysel'
when yo're away; for I'm lonesome enough at times. She and I will talk
a' t' better about yo' for both on us grieving after yo'.'</DD>

<DD>
So Kester took his leave, his mind set at ease by Sylvia's promise to go
and see his sister pretty often during his absence in the North.</DD>

<DD>
But Sylvia's habits were changed since she, as a girl at Haytersbank, liked
to spend half her time in the open air, running out perpetually without
anything on to scatter crumbs to the poultry, or to take a piece of bread
to the old cart-horse, to go up to the garden for a handful of herbs, or
to clamber to the highest point around to blow the horn which summoned
her father and Kester home to dinner. Living in a town where it was necessary
to put on hat and cloak before going out into the street, and then to walk
in a steady and decorous fashion, she had only cared to escape down to
the freedom of the sea-shore until Philip went away; and after that time
she had learnt so to fear observation as a deserted wife, that nothing
but Bella's health would have been a sufficient motive to take her out
of doors. And, as she had told Kester, the necessity of giving the little
girl a daily walk was very much lightened by the great love and affection
which Jeremiah Foster now bore to the child. Ever since the day when the
baby had come to his knee, allured by the temptation of his watch, he had
apparently considered her as in some sort belonging to him; and now he
had almost come to think that he had a right to claim her as his companion
in his walk back from the Bank to his early dinner, where a high chair
was always placed ready for the chance of her coming to share his meal.
On these occasions he generally brought her back to the shop-door when
he returned to his afternoon's work at the Bank. Sometimes, however, he
would leave word that she was to be sent for from his house in the New
Town, as his business at the Bank for that day was ended. Then Sylvia was
compelled to put on her things, and fetch back her darling; and excepting
for this errand she seldom went out at all on week-days.</DD>

<DD>
About a fortnight after Kester's farewell call, this need for her visit
to Jeremiah Foster's arose; and it seemed to Sylvia that there could not
be a better opportunity of fulfilling her promise and going to see the
widow Dobson, whose cottage was on the other side of the river, low down
on the cliff side, just at the bend and rush of the full stream into the
open sea. She set off pretty early in order to go there first. She found
the widow with her house-place tidied up after the midday meal, and busy
knitting at the open door--not looking at her rapid-clicking needles, but
gazing at the rush and recession of the waves before her; yet not seeing
them either,--rather seeing days long past.</DD>

<DD>
She started into active civility as soon as she recognized Sylvia, who
was to her as a great lady, never having known Sylvia Robson in her wild
childish days. Widow Dobson was always a little scandalized at her brother
Christopher's familiarity with Mrs Hepburn.</DD>

<DD>
She dusted a chair which needed no dusting, and placed it for Sylvia, sitting
down herself on a three-legged stool to mark her sense of the difference
in their conditions, for there was another chair or two in the humble dwelling;
and then the two fell into talk--first about Kester, whom his sister would
persist in calling Christopher, as if his dignity as her elder brother
was compromised by any familiar abbreviation; and by-and-by she opened
her heart a little more.</DD>

<DD>
'A could wish as a'd learned write-of-hand,' said she; 'for a've that for
to tell Christopher as might set his mind at ease. But yo' see, if a wrote
him a letter he couldn't read it; so a just comfort mysel' wi' thinkin'
nobody need learn writin' unless they'n got friends as can read. But a
reckon he'd ha' been glad to hear as a've getten a lodger.' Here she nodded
her head in the direction of the door opening out of the house-place into
the 'lean-to,' which Sylvia had observed on drawing near the cottage, and
the recollection of the mention of which by Kester had enabled her to identify
widow Dobson's dwelling. 'He's a-bed yonder,' the latter continued, dropping
her voice. 'He's a queer-lookin' tyke, but a don't think as he's a bad
un.'</DD>

<DD>
'When did he come?' said Sylvia, remembering Kester's account of his sister's
character, and feeling as though it behoved her, as Kester's confidante
on this head, to give cautious and prudent advice.</DD>

<DD>
'Eh! a matter of a s'ennight ago. A'm noane good at mindin' time; he's
paid me his rent twice, but then he were keen to pay aforehand. He'd comed
in one night, an' sate him down afore he could speak, he were so done up;
he'd been on tramp this many a day, a reckon. "Can yo' give me a bed?"
says he, panting like, after a bit. "A chap as a met near here says as
yo've a lodging for t' let." "Ay," says a, "a ha' that; but yo' mun pay
me a shilling a week for 't." Then my mind misgive me, for a thought he
hadn't a shilling i' t' world, an' yet if he hadn't, a should just ha'
gi'en him t' bed a' t' same: a'm not one as can turn a dog out if he comes
t' me wearied o' his life. So he outs wi' a shillin', an' lays it down
on t' table, 'bout a word. "A'll not trouble yo' long," says he. "A'm one
as is best out o' t' world," he says. Then a thought as a'd been a bit
hard upon him. An' says I, "A'm a widow-woman, and one as has getten but
few friends:" for yo' see a were low about our Christopher's goin' away
north; so a'm forced-like to speak hard to folk; but a've made mysel' some
stirabout for my supper; and if yo'd like t' share an' share about wi'
me, it's but puttin' a sup more watter to 't, and God's blessing 'll be
on 't, just as same as if 't were meal." So he ups wi' his hand afore his
e'en, and says not a word. At last he says, "Missus," says he, "can God's
blessing be shared by a sinner--one o' t' devil's children?" says he. "For
the Scriptur' says he's t' father o' lies." So a were puzzled-like; an'
at length a says, "Thou mun ask t' parson that; a'm but a poor faint-hearted
widow-woman; but a've allays had God's blessing somehow, now a bethink
me, an' a'll share it wi' thee as far as my will goes." So he raxes his
hand across t' table, an' mutters summat, as he grips mine. A thought it
were Scriptur' as he said, but a'd needed a' my strength just then for
t' lift t' pot off t' fire--it were t' first vittle a'd tasted sin' morn,
for t' famine comes down like stones on t' head o' us poor folk: an' a'
a said were just "Coom along, chap, an' fa' to; an' God's blessing be on
him as eats most." An' sin' that day him and me's been as thick as thieves,
only he's niver telled me nought of who he is, or wheere he comes fra'.
But a think he's one o' them poor colliers, as has getten brunt i' t' coal-pits;
for, t' be sure, his face is a' black wi' fire-marks; an' o' late days
he's ta'en t' his bed, an' just lies there sighing,--for one can hear him
plain as dayleet thro' t' bit partition wa'.'</DD>

<DD>
As a proof of this, a sigh--almost a groan--startled the two women at this
very moment.</DD>

<DD>
'Poor fellow!' said Sylvia, in a soft whisper. 'There's more sore hearts
i' t' world than one reckons for!' But after a while, she bethought her
again of Kester's account of his sister's 'softness;' and she thought that
it behoved her to give some good advice. So she added, in a sterner, harder
tone--'Still, yo' say yo' know nought about him; and tramps is tramps a'
t' world over; and yo're a widow, and it behoves yo' to be careful. I think
I'd just send him off as soon as he's a bit rested. Yo' say he's plenty
o' money?'</DD>

<DD>
'Nay! A never said that. A know nought about it. He pays me aforehand;
an' he pays me down for whativer a've getten for him; but that's but little;
he's noane up t' his vittle, though a've made him some broth as good as
a could make 'em.'</DD>

<DD>
'I wouldn't send him away till he was well again, if I were yo; but I think
yo'd be better rid on him,' said Sylvia. 'It would be different if yo'r
brother were in Monkshaven.' As she spoke she rose to go.</DD>

<DD>
Widow Dobson held her hand in hers for a minute, then the humble woman
said,--</DD>

<DD>
'Yo'll noane be vexed wi' me, missus, if a cannot find i' my heart t' turn
him out till he wants to go hissel'? For a wouldn't like to vex yo', for
Christopher's sake; but a know what it is for t' feel for friendless folk,
an' choose what may come on it, I cannot send him away.'</DD>

<DD>
'No!' said Sylvia. 'Why should I be vexed? it's no business o' mine. Only
I should send him away if I was yo'. He might go lodge wheere there was
men-folk, who know t' ways o' tramps, and are up to them.'</DD>

<DD>
Into the sunshine went Sylvia. In the cold shadow the miserable tramp lay
sighing. She did not know that she had been so near to him towards whom
her heart was softening, day by day.</DD>
