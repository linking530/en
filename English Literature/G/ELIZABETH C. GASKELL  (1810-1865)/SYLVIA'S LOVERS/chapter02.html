<DD>
One hot day, early in October of the year 1796, two girls set off from
their country homes to Monkshaven to sell their butter and eggs, for they
were both farmers' daughters, though rather in different circumstances;
for Molly Corney was one of a large family of children, and had to rough
it accordingly; Sylvia Robson was an only child, and was much made of in
more people's estimation than Mary's by her elderly parents. They had each
purchases to make after their sales were effected, as sales of butter and
eggs were effected in those days by the market-women sitting on the steps
of the great old mutilated cross till a certain hour in the afternoon,
after which, if all their goods were not disposed of, they took them unwillingly
to the shops and sold them at a lower price. But good housewives did not
despise coming themselves to the Butter Cross, and, smelling and depreciating
the articles they wanted, kept up a perpetual struggle of words, trying,
often in vain, to beat down prices. A housekeeper of the last century would
have thought that she did not know her business, if she had not gone through
this preliminary process; and the farmers' wives and daughters treated
it all as a matter of course, replying with a good deal of independent
humour to the customer, who, once having discovered where good butter and
fresh eggs were to be sold, came time after time to depreciate the articles
she always ended in taking. There was leisure for all this kind of work
in those days.</DD>

<DD>
Molly had tied a knot on her pink-spotted handkerchief for each of the
various purchases she had to make; dull but important articles needed for
the week's consumption at home; if she forgot any one of them she knew
she was sure of a good 'rating' from her mother. The number of them made
her pocket-handkerchief look like one of the nine-tails of a 'cat;' but
not a single thing was for herself, nor, indeed, for any one individual
of her numerous family. There was neither much thought nor much money to
spend for any but collective wants in the Corney family.</DD>

<DD>
It was different with Sylvia. She was going to choose her first cloak,
not to have an old one of her mother's, that had gone down through two
sisters, dyed for the fourth time (and Molly would have been glad had even
this chance been hers), but to buy a bran-new duffle cloak all for herself,
with not even an elder authority to curb her as to price, only Molly to
give her admiring counsel, and as much sympathy as was consistent with
a little patient envy of Sylvia's happier circumstances. Every now and
then they wandered off from the one grand subject of thought, but Sylvia,
with unconscious art, soon brought the conversation round to the fresh
consideration of the respective merits of gray and scarlet. These girls
were walking bare-foot and carrying their shoes and stockings in their
hands during the first part of their way; but as they were drawing near
Monkshaven they stopped, and turned aside along a foot-path that led from
the main-road down to the banks of the Dee. There were great stones in
the river about here, round which the waters gathered and eddied and formed
deep pools. Molly sate down on the grassy bank to wash her feet; but Sylvia,
more active (or perhaps lighter-hearted with the notion of the cloak in
the distance), placed her basket on a gravelly bit of shore, and, giving
a long spring, seated herself on a stone almost in the middle of the stream.
Then she began dipping her little rosy toes in the cool rushing water and
whisking them out with childish glee.</DD>

<DD>
'Be quiet, wi' the', Sylvia? Thou'st splashing me all ower, and my feyther'll
noane be so keen o' giving me a new cloak as thine is, seemingly.'</DD>

<DD>
Sylvia was quiet, not to say penitent, in a moment. She drew up her feet
instantly; and, as if to take herself out of temptation, she turned away
from Molly to that side of her stony seat on which the current ran shallow,
and broken by pebbles. But once disturbed in her play, her thoughts reverted
to the great subject of the cloak. She was now as still as a minute before
she had been full of frolic and gambolling life. She had tucked herself
up on the stone, as if it had been a cushion, and she a little sultana.</DD>

<DD>
Molly was deliberately washing her feet and drawing on her stockings, when
she heard a sudden sigh, and her companion turned round so as to face her,
and said,</DD>

<DD>
'I wish mother hadn't spoken up for t' gray.'</DD>

<DD>
'Why, Sylvia, thou wert saying as we topped t'brow, as she did nought but
bid thee think twice afore settling on scarlet.'</DD>

<DD>
'Ay! but mother's words are scarce, and weigh heavy. Feyther's liker me,
and we talk a deal o' rubble; but mother's words are liker to hewn stone
She puts a deal o' meaning in 'em. And then,' said Sylvia, as if she was
put out by the suggestion, 'she bid me ask cousin Philip for his opinion.
I hate a man as has getten an opinion on such-like things.'</DD>

<DD>
'Well! we shall niver get to Monkshaven this day, either for to sell our
eggs and stuff, or to buy thy cloak, if we're sittin' here much longer.
T' sun's for slanting low, so come along, lass, and let's be going.'</DD>

<DD>
'But if I put on my stockings and shoon here, and jump back into yon wet
gravel, I 'se not be fit to be seen,' said Sylvia, in a pathetic tone of
bewilderment, that was funnily childlike. She stood up, her bare feet curved
round the curving surface of the stone, her slight figure balancing as
if in act to spring.</DD>

<DD>
'Thou knows thou'll have just to jump back barefoot, and wash thy feet
afresh, without making all that ado; thou shouldst ha' done it at first,
like me, and all other sensible folk. But thou'st getten no gumption.'</DD>

<DD>
Molly's mouth was stopped by Sylvia's hand. She was already on the river
bank by her friend's side.</DD>

<DD>
'Now dunnot lecture me; I'm none for a sermon hung on every peg o' words.
I'm going to have a new cloak, lass, and I cannot heed thee if thou dost
lecture. Thou shall have all the gumption, and I'll have my cloak.'</DD>

<DD>
It may be doubted whether Molly thought this an equal division.</DD>

<DD>
Each girl wore tightly-fitting stockings, knit by her own hands, of the
blue worsted common in that country; they had on neat high-heeled black
leather shoes, coming well over the instep, and fastened as well as ornamented
with bright steel buckles. They did not walk so lightly and freely now
as they did before they were shod, but their steps were still springy with
the buoyancy of early youth; for neither of them was twenty, indeed I believe
Sylvia was not more than seventeen at this time.</DD>

<DD>
They clambered up the steep grassy path, with brambles catching at their
kilted petticoats, through the copse-wood, till they regained the high
road; and then they ' settled themselves,' as they called it; that is to
say, they took off their black felt hats, and tied up their clustering
hair afresh; they shook off every speck of wayside dust; straightened the
little shawls (or large neck-kerchiefs, call them which you will) that
were spread over their shoulders, pinned below the throat, and confined
at the waist by their apron-strings; and then putting on their hats again,
and picking up their baskets, they prepared to walk decorously into the
town of Monkshaven.</DD>

<DD>
The next turn of the road showed them the red peaked roofs of the closely
packed houses lying almost directly below the hill on which they were.
The full autumn sun brought out the ruddy colour of the tiled gables, and
deepened the shadows in the narrow streets. The narrow harbour at the mouth
of the river was crowded with small vessels of all descriptions, making
an intricate forest of masts. Beyond lay the sea, like a flat pavement
of sapphire, scarcely a ripple varying its sunny surface, that stretched
out leagues away till it blended with the softened azure of the sky. On
this blue trackless water floated scores of white-sailed fishing boats,
apparently motionless, unless you measured their progress by some land-mark;
but still, and silent, and distant as they seemed, the consciousness that
there were men on board, each going forth into the great deep, added unspeakably
to the interest felt in watching them. Close to the bar of the river Dee
a larger vessel lay to. Sylvia, who had only recently come into the neighbourhood,
looked at this with the same quiet interest as she did at all the others;
but Molly, as soon as her eye caught the build of it, cried out aloud--</DD>

<DD>
'She's a whaler! she's a whaler home from t' Greenlandseas! T' first this
season! God bless her!' and she turned round and shook both Sylvia's hands
in the fulness of her excitement. Sylvia's colour rose, and her eyes sparkled
out of sympathy.</DD>

<DD>
'Is ta sure?' she asked, breathless in her turn; for though she did not
know by the aspect of the different ships on what trade they were bound,
yet she was well aware of the paramount interest attached to whaling vessels.</DD>

<DD>
'Three o'clock! and it's not high water till five!' said Molly. 'If we're
sharp we can sell our eggs, and be down to the staithes before she comes
into port. Be sharp, lass!'</DD>

<DD>
And down the steep long hill they went at a pace that was almost a run.
A run they dared not make it; and as it was, the rate at which they walked
would have caused destruction among eggs less carefully packed. When the
descent was ended, there was yet the long narrow street before them, bending
and swerving from the straight line, as it followed the course of the river.
The girls felt as if they should never come to the market-place, which
was situated at the crossing of Bridge Street and High Street. There the
old stone cross was raised by the monks long ago; now worn and mutilated,
no one esteemed it as a holy symbol, but only as the Butter Cross, where
market-women clustered on Wednesday, and whence the town crier made all
his proclamations of household sales, things lost or found, beginning with
'Oh! yes, oh! yes, oh! yes!' and ending with 'God bless the king and the
lord of this manor,' and a very brisk 'Amen,' before he went on his way
and took off the livery-coat, the colours of which marked him as a servant
of the Burnabys, the family who held manorial rights over Monkshaven.</DD>

<DD>
Of course the much frequented space surrounding the Butter Cross was the
favourite centre for shops; and on this day, a fine market-day, just when
good housewives begin to look over their winter store of blankets and flannels,
and discover their needs betimes, these shops ought to have had plenty
of customers. But they were empty and of even quieter aspect than their
every-day wont. The three-legged creepie-stools that were hired out at
a penny an hour to such market-women as came too late to find room on the
steps were unoccupied; knocked over here and there, as if people had passed
by in haste.</DD>

<DD>
Molly took in all at a glance, and interpreted the signs, though she had
no time to explain their meaning, and her consequent course of action,
to Sylvia, but darted into a corner shop.</DD>

<DD>
'T' whalers is coming home! There's one lying outside t' bar!'</DD>

<DD>
This was put in the form of an assertion; but the tone was that of eager
cross-questioning.</DD>

<DD>
'Ay!' said a lame man, mending fishing-nets behind a rough deal counter.
'She's come back airly, and she's brought good news o' t' others, as I've
heered say. Time was I should ha' been on th' staithes throwing up my cap
wit' t' best on 'em; but now it pleases t' Lord to keep me at home, and
set me to mind other folks' gear. See thee, wench, there's a vast o' folk
ha' left their skeps o' things wi' me while they're away down to t' quay
side. Leave me your eggs and be off wi' ye for t' see t' fun, for mebbe
ye'll live to be palsied yet, and then ye'll be fretting ower spilt milk,
and that ye didn't tak' all chances when ye was young. Ay, well! they're
out o' hearin' o' my moralities; I'd better find a lamiter like mysen to
preach to, for it's not iverybody has t' luck t' clargy has of saying their
say out whether folks likes it or not.'</DD>

<DD>
He put the baskets carefully away with much of such talk as this addressed
to himself while he did so. Then he sighed once or twice; and then he took
the better course and began to sing over his tarry work.</DD>

<DD>
Molly and Sylvia were far along the staithes by the time he got to this
point of cheerfulness. They ran on, regardless of stitches and pains in
the side; on along the river bank to where the concourse of people was
gathered. There was no great length of way between the Butter Cross and
the harbour; in five minutes the breathless girls were close together in
the best place they could get for seeing, on the outside of the crowd;
and in as short a time longer they were pressed inwards, by fresh arrivals,
into the very midst of the throng. All eyes were directed to the ship,
beating her anchor just outside the bar, not a quarter of a mile away.
The custom-house officer was just gone aboard of her to receive the captain's
report of his cargo, and make due examination. The men who had taken him
out in his boat were rowing back to the shore, and brought small fragments
of news when they landed a little distance from the crowd, which moved
as one man to hear what was to be told. Sylvia took a hard grasp of the
hand of the older and more experienced Molly, and listened open-mouthed
to the answers she was extracting from a gruff old sailor she happened
to find near her.</DD>

<DD>
'What ship is she?'</DD>

<DD>
'T' <I>Resolution</I> of Monkshaven!' said he, indignantly, as if any goose
might have known that.</DD>

<DD>
'An' a good <I>Resolution</I>, and a blessed ship she's been to me,' piped
out an old woman, close at Mary's elbow. 'She's brought me home my ae'
lad--for he shouted to yon boatman to bid him tell me he was well. 'Tell
Peggy Christison,' says he (my name is Margaret Christison)--'tell Peggy
Christison as her son Hezekiah is come back safe and sound.' The Lord's
name be praised! An' me a widow as never thought to see my lad again!'</DD>

<DD>
It seemed as if everybody relied on every one else's sympathy in that hour
of great joy.</DD>

<DD>
'I ax pardon, but if you'd gie me just a bit of elbow-room for a minute
like, I'd hold my babby up, so that he might see daddy's ship, and happen,
my master might see him. He's four months old last Tuesday se'nnight, and
his feyther's never clapt eyne on him yet, and he wi' a tooth through,
an another just breaking, bless him!'</DD>

<DD>
One or two of the better end of the Monkshaven inhabitants stood a little
before Molly and Sylvia; and as they moved in compliance with the young
mother's request, they overheard some of the information these ship-owners
had received from the boatman.</DD>

<DD>
'Haynes says they'll send the manifest of the cargo ashore in twenty minutes
as soon as Fishburn has looked over the casks. Only eight whales, according
to what he says.'</DD>

<DD>
'No one can tell,' said the other, 'till the manifest comes to hand.'</DD>

<DD>
'I'm afraid he's right. But he brings a good report of the <I>Good Fortune</I>.
She's off St Abb's Head, with something like fifteen whales to her share.'</DD>

<DD>
'We shall see how much is true, when she comes in.'</DD>

<DD>
'That'll be by the afternoon-tide to-morrow.'</DD>

<DD>
'That's my cousin's ship,' said Molly to Sylvia. 'He's speck-sioneer on
board the <I>Good Fortune</I>.'</DD>

<DD>
An old man touched her as she spoke--</DD>

<DD>
'I humbly make my manners, missus, but I'm stone blind; my lad's aboard
yon vessel outside t' bar; and my old woman is bed-fast. Will she be long,
think ye, in making t' harbour? Because, if so be as she were, I'd just
make my way back, and speak a word or two to my missus, who'll be boiling
o'er into some mak o' mischief now she knows he's so near. May I be sobold
as to ax if t' Crooked Negro is covered yet?'</DD>

<DD>
Molly stood on tip-toe to try and see the black stone thus named; but Sylvia,
stooping and peeping through the glimpses afforded between the arms of
the moving people, saw it first, and told the blind old man it was still
above water.</DD>

<DD>
'A watched pot,' said he, 'ne'er boils, I reckon. It's ta'en a vast o'
watter t' cover that stone to-day. Anyhow, I'll have time to go home and
rate my missus for worritin' hersen, as I'll be bound she's done, for all
as I bade her not, but to keep easy and content.'</DD>

<DD>
'We'd better be off too,' said Molly, as an opening was made through the
press to let out the groping old man. 'Eggs and butter is yet to sell,
and tha' cloak to be bought.'</DD>

<DD>
'Well, I suppose we had!' said Sylvia, rather regretfully; for, though
all the way into Monkshaven her head had been full of the purchase of this
cloak, yet she was of that impressible nature that takes the tone of feeling
from those surrounding; and though she knew no one on board the Resolution,
she was just as anxious for the moment to see her come into harbour as
any one in the crowd who had a dear relation on board. So she turned reluctantly
to follow the more prudent Molly along the quay back to the Butter Cross.</DD>

<DD>
It was a pretty scene, though it was too familiar to the eyes of all who
then saw it for them to notice its beauty. The sun was low enough in the
west to turn the mist that filled the distant valley of the river into
golden haze. Above, on either bank of the Dee, there lay the moorland heights
swelling one behind the other; the nearer, russet brown with the tints
of the fading bracken; the more distant, gray and dim against the rich
autumnal sky. The red and fluted tiles of the gabled houses rose in crowded
irregularity on one side of the river, while the newer suburb was built
in more orderly and less picturesque fashion on the opposite cliff. The
river itself was swelling and chafing with the incoming tide till its vexed
waters rushed over the very feet of the watching crowd on the staithes,
as the great sea waves encroached more and more every minute. The quay-side
was unsavourily ornamented with glittering fish-scales, for the hauls of
fish were cleansed in the open air, and no sanitary arrangements existed
for sweeping away any of the relics of this operation.</DD>

<DD>
The fresh salt breeze was bringing up the lashing, leaping tide from the
blue sea beyond the bar. Behind the returning girls there rocked the white-sailed
ship, as if she were all alive with eagerness for her anchors to be heaved.</DD>

<DD>
How impatient her crew of beating hearts were for that moment, how those
on land sickened at the suspense, may be imagined, when you remember that
for six long summer months those sailors had been as if dead from all news
of those they loved; shut up in terrible, dreary Arctic seas from the hungry
sight of sweethearts and friends, wives and mothers. No one knew what might
have happened. The crowd on shore grew silent and solemn before the dread
of the possible news of death that might toll in upon their hearts with
this uprushing tide. The whalers went out into the Greenland seas full
of strong, hopeful men; but the whalers never returned as they sailed forth.
On land there are deaths among two or three hundred men to be mourned over
in every half-year's space of time. Whose bones had been left to blacken
on the gray and terrible icebergs? Who lay still until the sea should give
up its dead? who were those who should come back to Monkshaven never, no,
never more?</DD>

<DD>
Many a heart swelled with passionate, unspoken fear, as the first whaler
lay off the bar on her return voyage.</DD>

<DD>
Molly and Sylvia had left the crowd in this hushed suspense. But fifty
yards along the staithe they passed five or six girls with flushed faces
and careless attire, who had mounted a pile of timber, placed there to
season for ship-building, from which as from the steps of a ladder or staircase,
they could command the harbour. They were wild and free in their gestures,
and held each other by the hand, and swayed from side to side, stamping
their feet in time, as they sang--</DD>

<DD>
Weel may the keel row, the keel row, the keel row,</DD>

<DD>
Weel may the keel row that my laddie's in!</DD>

<DD>
'What for are ye going off, now?' they called out to our two girls. 'She'll
be in in ten minutes!' and without waiting for the answer which never came,
they resumed their song.</DD>

<DD>
Old sailors stood about in little groups, too proud to show their interest
in the adventures they could no longer share, but quite unable to keep
up any semblance of talk on indifferent subjects.</DD>

<DD>
The town seemed very quiet and deserted as Molly and Sylvia entered the
dark, irregular Bridge Street, and the market-place was as empty of people
as before. But the skeps and baskets and three-legged stools were all cleared
away.</DD>

<DD>
'Market's over for to-day,' said Molly Corney, in disappointed surprise.
'We mun make the best on't, and sell to t' huxters, and a hard bargain
they'll be for driving. I doubt mother'll be vexed.'</DD>

<DD>
She and Sylvia went to the corner shop to reclaim their baskets. The man
had his joke at them for their delay.</DD>

<DD>
'Ay, ay! lasses as has sweethearts a-coming home don't care much what price
they get for butter and eggs! I dare say, now, there's some un in yon ship
that 'ud give as much as a shilling a pound for this butter if he only
knowed who churned it!' This was to Sylvia, as he handed her back her property.</DD>

<DD>
The fancy-free Sylvia reddened, pouted, tossed back her head, and hardly
deigned a farewell word of thanks or civility to the lame man; she was
at an age to be affronted by any jokes on such a subject. Molly took the
joke without disclaimer and without offence. She rather liked the unfounded
idea of her having a sweetheart, and was rather surprised to think how
devoid of foundation the notion was. If she could have a new cloak as Sylvia
was going to have, then, indeed, there might be a chance! Until some such
good luck, it was as well to laugh and blush as if the surmise of her having
a lover was not very far from the truth, and so she replied in something
of the same strain as the lame net-maker to his joke about the butter.</DD>

<DD>
'He'll need it all, and more too, to grease his tongue, if iver he reckons
to win me for his wife!'</DD>

<DD>
When they were out of the shop, Sylvia said, in a coaxing tone,--</DD>

<DD>
'Molly, who is it? Whose tongue 'll need greasing? Just tell me, and I'll
never tell!'</DD>

<DD>
She was so much in earnest that Molly was perplexed. She did not quite
like saying that she had alluded to no one in particular, only to a possible
sweetheart, so she began to think what young man had made the most civil
speeches to her in her life; the list was not a long one to go over, for
her father was not so well off as to make her sought after for her money,
and her face was rather of the homeliest. But she suddenly remembered her
cousin, the specksioneer, who had given her two large shells, and taken
a kiss from her half-willing lips before he went to sea the last time.
So she smiled a little, and then said,--</DD>

<DD>
'Well! I dunno. It's ill talking o' these things afore one has made up
one's mind. And perhaps if Charley Kinraid behaves hissen, I might be brought
to listen.'</DD>

<DD>
'Charley Kinraid! who's he?'</DD>

<DD>
'Yon specksioneer cousin o' mine, as I was talking on.'</DD>

<DD>
'And do yo' think he cares for yo'?' asked Sylvia, in a low, tender tone,
as if touching on a great mystery.</DD>

<DD>
Molly only said, 'Be quiet wi' yo',' and Sylvia could not make out whether
she cut the conversation so short because she was offended, or because
they had come to the shop where they had to sell their butter and eggs.</DD>

<DD>
'Now, Sylvia, if thou'll leave me thy basket, I'll make as good a bargain
as iver I can on 'em; and thou can be off to choose this grand new cloak
as is to be, afore it gets any darker. Where is ta going to?'</DD>

<DD>
'Mother said I'd better go to Foster's,' answered Sylvia, with a shade
of annoyance in her face. 'Feyther said just anywhere.'</DD>

<DD>
'Foster's is t' best place; thou canst try anywhere afterwards. I'll be
at Foster's in five minutes, for I reckon we mun hasten a bit now. It'll
be near five o'clock.'</DD>

<DD>
Sylvia hung her head and looked very demure as she walked off by herself
to Foster's shop in the market-place.</DD>
