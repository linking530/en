<DD>
Philip took possession of the two rooms which had belonged to the dead
Sergeant Dobson. They were furnished sufficiently for every comfort by
the trustees of the hospital. Some little fragments of ornament, some small
articles picked up in distant countries, a few tattered books, remained
in the rooms as legacies from their former occupant.</DD>

<DD>
At first the repose of the life and the place was inexpressibly grateful
to Philip. He had always shrunk from encountering strangers, and displaying
his blackened and scarred countenance to them, even where such disfigurement
was most regarded as a mark of honour. In St. Sepulchre's he met none but
the same set day after day, and when he had once told the tale of how it
happened and submitted to their gaze, it was over for ever, if he so minded.
The slight employment his garden gave him--there was a kitchen-garden behind
each house, as well as the flower-plot in front--and the daily arrangement
of his parlour and chamber were, at the beginning of his time of occupation,
as much bodily labour as he could manage. There was something stately and
utterly removed from all Philip's previous existence in the forms observed
at every day's dinner, when the twelve bedesmen met in the large quaint
hall, and the warden came in his college-cap and gown to say the long Latin
grace which wound up with something very like a prayer for the soul of
Sir Simon Bray. It took some time to get a reply to ship letters in those
times when no one could exactly say where the fleet might be found.</DD>

<DD>
And before Dr Pennington had received the excellent character of Stephen
Freeman, which his son gladly sent in answer to his father's inquiries,
Philip had become restless and uneasy in the midst of all this peace and
comfort.</DD>

<DD>
Sitting alone over his fire in the long winter evenings, the scenes of
his past life rose before him; his childhood; his aunt Robson's care of
him; his first going to Foster's shop in Monkshaven; Haytersbank Farm,
and the spelling lessons in the bright warm kitchen there; Kinraid's appearance;
the miserable night of the Corneys' party; the farewell he had witnessed
on Monkshaven sands; the press-gang, and all the long consequences of that
act of concealment; poor Daniel Robson's trial and execution; his own marriage;
his child's birth; and then he came to that last day at Monkshaven: and
he went over and over again the torturing details, the looks of contempt
and anger, the words of loathing indignation, till he almost brought himself,
out of his extreme sympathy with Sylvia, to believe that he was indeed
the wretch she had considered him to be.</DD>

<DD>
He forgot his own excuses for having acted as he had done; though these
excuses had at one time seemed to him to wear the garb of reasons. After
long thought and bitter memory came some wonder. What was Sylvia doing
now? Where was she? What was his child like--his child as well as hers?
And then he remembered the poor footsore wife and the little girl she carried
in her arms, that was just the age of Bella; he wished he had noticed that
child more, that a clear vision of it might rise up when he wanted to picture
Bella.</DD>

<DD>
One night he had gone round this mill-wheel circle of ideas till he was
weary to the very marrow of his bones. To shake off the monotonous impression
he rose to look for a book amongst the old tattered volumes, hoping that
he might find something that would sufficiently lay hold of him to change
the current of his thoughts. There was an odd volume of <I>Peregrine Pickle</I>,
a book of sermons; half an army list of 1774, and the <I>Seven Champions
of Christendom</I>. Philip took up this last, which he had never seen before.
In it he read how Sir Guy, Earl of Warwick, went to fight the Paynim in
his own country, and was away for seven long years; and when he came back
his own wife Phillis, the countess in her castle, did not know the poor
travel-worn hermit, who came daily to seek his dole of bread at her hands
along with many beggars and much poor. But at last, when he lay a-dying
in his cave in the rock, he sent for her by a secret sign known but to
them twain. And she came with great speed, for she knew it was her lord
who had sent for her; and they had many sweet and holy words together before
he gave up the ghost, his head lying on her bosom.</DD>

<DD>
The old story known to most people from their childhood was all new and
fresh to Philip. He did not quite believe in the truth of it, because the
fictitious nature of the histories of some of the other Champions of Christendom
was too patent. But he could not help thinking that this one might be true;
and that Guy and Phillis might have been as real flesh and blood, long,
long ago, as he and Sylvia had even been. The old room, the quiet moonlit
quadrangle into which the cross-barred casement looked, the quaint aspect
of everything that he had seen for weeks and weeks; all this predisposed
Philip to dwell upon the story he had just been reading as a faithful legend
of two lovers whose bones were long since dust. He thought that if he could
thus see Sylvia, himself unknown, unseen--could live at her gates, so to
speak, and gaze upon her and his child--some day too, when he lay a-dying,
he might send for her, and in soft words of mutual forgiveness breathe
his life away in her arms. Or perhaps----and so he lost himself, and from
thinking, passed on to dreaming. All night long Guy and Phillis, Sylvia
and his child, passed in and out of his visions; it was impossible to make
the fragments of his dreams cohere; but the impression made upon him by
them was not the less strong for this. He felt as if he were called to
Monkshaven, wanted at Monkshaven, and to Monkshaven he resolved to go;
although when his reason overtook his feeling, he knew perfectly how unwise
it was to leave a home of peace and tranquillity and surrounding friendliness,
to go to a place where nothing but want and wretchedness awaited him unless
he made himself known, and if he did, a deeper want, a more woeful wretchedness,
would in all probability be his portion.</DD>

<DD>
In the small oblong of looking-glass hung against the wall, Philip caught
the reflection of his own face, and laughed scornfully at the sight. The
thin hair lay upon his temples in the flakes that betoken long ill-health;
his eyes were the same as ever, and they had always been considered the
best feature in his face; but they were sunk in their orbits, and looked
hollow and gloomy. As for the lower part of his face, blackened, contracted,
drawn away from his teeth, the outline entirely changed by the breakage
of his jaw-bone, he was indeed a fool if he thought himself fit to go forth
to win back that love which Sylvia had forsworn. As a hermit and a beggar,
he must return to Monkshaven, and fall perforce into the same position
which Guy of Warwick had only assumed. But still he should see his Phillis,
and might feast his sad hopeless eyes from time to time with the sight
of his child. His small pension of sixpence a day would keep him from absolute
want of necessaries.</DD>

<DD>
So that very day he went to the warden and told him he thought of giving
up his share in the bequest of Sir Simon Bray. Such a relinquishment had
never occurred before in all the warden's experience; and he was very much
inclined to be offended.</DD>

<DD>
'I must say that for a man not to be satisfied as a bedesman of St. Sepulchre's
argues a very wrong state of mind, and a very ungrateful heart.'</DD>

<DD>
'I'm sure, sir, it's not from any ingratitude, for I can hardly feel thankful
to you and to Sir Simon, and to madam, and the young ladies, and all my
comrades in the hospital, and I niver expect to be either so comfortable
or so peaceful again, but----'</DD>

<DD>
'But? What can you have to say against the place, then? Not but what there
are always plenty of applicants for every vacancy; only I thought I was
doing a kindness to a man out of Harry's company. And you'll not see Harry
either; he's got his leave in March!'</DD>

<DD>
'I'm very sorry. I should like to have seen the lieutenant again. But I
cannot rest any longer so far away from--people I once knew.'</DD>

<DD>
'Ten to one they're dead, or removed, or something or other by this time;
and it'll serve you right if they are. Mind! no one can be chosen twice
to be a bedesman of St. Sepulchre's.'</DD>

<DD>
The warden turned away; and Philip, uneasy at staying, disheartened at
leaving, went to make his few preparations for setting out once more on
his journey northwards. He had to give notice of his change of residence
to the local distributor of pensions; and one or two farewells had to be
taken, with more than usual sadness at the necessity; for Philip, under
his name of Stephen Freeman, had attached some of the older bedesmen a
good deal to him, from his unselfishness, his willingness to read to them,
and to render them many little services, and, perhaps, as much as anything,
by his habitual silence, which made him a convenient recipient of all their
garrulousness. So before the time for his departure came, he had the opportunity
of one more interview with the warden, of a more friendly character than
that in which he gave up his bedesmanship. And so far it was well; and
Philip turned his back upon St. Sepulchre's with his sore heart partly
healed by his four months' residence there.</DD>

<DD>
He was stronger, too, in body, more capable of the day-after-day walks
that were required of him. He had saved some money from his allowance as
bedesman and from his pension, and might occasionally have taken an outside
place on a coach, had it not been that he shrank from the first look of
every stranger upon his disfigured face. Yet the gentle, wistful eyes,
and the white and faultless teeth always did away with the first impression
as soon as people became a little acquainted with his appearance.</DD>

<DD>
It was February when Philip left St. Sepulchre's. It was the first week
in April when he began to recognize the familiar objects between York and
Monkshaven. And now he began to hang back, and to question the wisdom of
what he had done--just as the warden had prophesied that he would. The
last night of his two hundred mile walk he slept at the little inn at which
he had been enlisted nearly two years before. It was by no intention of
his that he rested at that identical place. Night was drawing on; and,
in making, as he thought, a short cut, he had missed his way, and was fain
to seek shelter where he might find it. But it brought him very straight
face to face with his life at that time, and ever since. His mad, wild
hopes--half the result of intoxication, as he now knew--all dead and gone;
the career then freshly opening shut up against him now; his youthful strength
and health changed into premature infirmity, and the home and the love
that should have opened wide its doors to console him for all, why in two
years Death might have been busy, and taken away from him his last feeble
chance of the faint happiness of seeing his beloved without being seen
or known of her. All that night and all the next day, the fear of Sylvia's
possible death overclouded his heart. It was strange that he had hardly
ever thought of this before; so strange, that now, when the terror came,
it took possession of him, and he could almost have sworn that she must
be lying dead in Monkshaven churchyard. Or was it little Bella, that blooming,
lovely babe, whom he was never to see again? There was the tolling of mournful
bells in the distant air to his disturbed fancy, and the cry of the happy
birds, the plaintive bleating of the new-dropped lambs, were all omens
of evil import to him.</DD>

<DD>
As well as he could, he found his way back to Monkshaven, over the wild
heights and moors he had crossed on that black day of misery; why he should
have chosen that path he could not tell--it was as if he were led, and
had no free will of his own.</DD>

<DD>
The soft clear evening was drawing on, and his heart beat thick, and then
stopped, only to start again with fresh violence. There he was, at the
top of the long, steep lane that was in some parts a literal staircase
leading down from the hill-top into the High Street, through the very entry
up which he had passed when he shrank away from his former and his then
present life. There he stood, looking down once more at the numerous irregular
roofs, the many stacks of chimneys below him, seeking out that which had
once been his own dwelling--who dwelt there now?</DD>

<DD>
The yellower gleams grew narrower; the evening shadows broader, and Philip
crept down the lane a weary, woeful man. At every gap in the close-packed
buildings he heard the merry music of a band, the cheerful sound of excited
voices. Still he descended slowly, scarcely wondering what it could be,
for it was not associated in his mind with the one pervading thought of
Sylvia.</DD>

<DD>
When he came to the angle of junction between the lane and the High Street,
he seemed plunged all at once into the very centre of the bustle, and he
drew himself up into a corner of deep shadow, from whence he could look
out upon the street.</DD>

<DD>
A circus was making its grand entry into Monkshaven, with all the pomp
of colour and of noise that it could muster. Trumpeters in parti-coloured
clothes rode first, blaring out triumphant discord. Next came a gold-and-scarlet
chariot drawn by six piebald horses, and the windings of this team through
the tortuous narrow street were pretty enough to look upon. In the chariot
sate kings and queens, heroes and heroines, or what were meant for such;
all the little boys and girls running alongside of the chariot envied them;
but they themselves were very much tired, and shivering with cold in their
heroic pomp of classic clothing. All this Philip might have seen; did see,
in fact; but heeded not one jot. Almost opposite to him, not ten yards
apart, standing on the raised step at the well-known shop door, was Sylvia,
holding a child, a merry dancing child, up in her arms to see the show.
She too, Sylvia, was laughing for pleasure, and for sympathy with pleasure.
She held the little Bella aloft that the child might see the gaudy procession
the better and the longer, looking at it herself with red lips apart and
white teeth glancing through; then she turned to speak to some one behind
her--Coulson, as Philip saw the moment afterwards; his answer made her
laugh once again. Philip saw it all; her bonny careless looks, her pretty
matronly form, her evident ease of mind and prosperous outward circumstances.
The years that he had spent in gloomy sorrow, amongst wild scenes, on land
or by sea, his life in frequent peril of a bloody end, had gone by with
her like sunny days; all the more sunny because he was not there. So bitterly
thought the poor disabled marine, as, weary and despairing, he stood in
the cold shadow and looked upon the home that should have been his haven,
the wife that should have welcomed him, the child that should have been
his comfort. He had banished himself from his home; his wife had forsworn
him; his child was blossoming into intelligence unwitting of any father.
Wife, and child, and home, were all doing well without him; what madness
had tempted him thither? an hour ago, like a fanciful fool, he had thought
she might be dead--dead with sad penitence for her cruel words at her heart--with
mournful wonder at the unaccounted-for absence of her child's father preying
on her spirits, and in some measure causing the death he had apprehended.
But to look at her there where she stood, it did not seem as if she had
had an hour's painful thought in all her blooming life.</DD>

<DD>
Ay! go in to the warm hearth, mother and child, now the gay cavalcade has
gone out of sight, and the chill of night has succeeded to the sun's setting.
Husband and father, steal out into the cold dark street, and seek some
poor cheap lodging where you may rest your weary bones, and cheat your
more weary heart into forgetfulness in sleep. The pretty story of the Countess
Phillis, who mourned for her husband's absence so long, is a fable of old
times; or rather say Earl Guy never wedded his wife, knowing that one she
loved better than him was alive all the time she had believed him to be
dead.</DD>
