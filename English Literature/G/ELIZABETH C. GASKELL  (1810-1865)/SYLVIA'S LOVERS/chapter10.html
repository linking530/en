Sylvia was still full of the specksioneer and his stories, when Hepburn
came up to give her the next lesson. But the prospect of a little sensible
commendation for writing a whole page full of flourishing 'Abednegos,'
had lost all the slight charm it had ever possessed. She was much more
inclined to try and elicit some sympathy in her interest in the perils
and adventures of the northern seas, than to bend and control her mind
to the right formation of letters. Unwisely enough, she endeavoured to
repeat one of the narratives that she had heard from Kinraid; and when
she found that Hepburn (if, indeed, he did not look upon the whole as a
silly invention) considered it only as an interruption to the real business
in hand, to which he would try to listen as patiently as he could, in the
hope of Sylvia's applying herself diligently to her copy-book when she
had cleared her mind, she contracted her pretty lips, as if to check them
from making any further appeals for sympathy, and set about her writing-lesson
in a very rebellious frame of mind, only restrained by her mother's presence
from spoken mutiny.</DD>

<DD>
'After ail,' said she, throwing down her pen, and opening and shutting
her weary, cramped hand, 'I see no good in tiring myself wi' learning for
t' write letters when I'se never got one in a my life. What for should
I write answers, when there's niver a one writes to me? and if I had one,
I couldn't read it; it's bad enough wi' a book o' print as I've niver seen
afore, for there's sure to be new-fangled words in 't. I'm sure I wish
the man were farred who plagues his brains wi' striking out new words.
Why can't folks just ha' a set on 'em for good and a'?'</DD>

<DD>
'Why! you'll be after using two or three hundred yoursel' every day as
you live, Sylvie; and yet I must use a great many as you never think on
about t' shop; and t' folks in t' fields want their set, let alone the
high English that parsons and lawyers speak.'</DD>

<DD>
'Well, it's weary work is reading and writing. Cannot you learn me something
else, if we mun do lessons?'</DD>

<DD>
'There's sums--and geography,' said Hepburn, slowly and gravely.</DD>

<DD>
'Geography!' said Sylvia, brightening, and perhaps not pronouncing the
word quite correctly, 'I'd like yo' to learn me geography. There's a deal
o' places I want to hear all about.'</DD>

<DD>
'Well, I'll bring up a book and a map next time. But I can tell you something
now. There's four quarters in the globe.'</DD>

<DD>
'What's that?' asked Sylvia.</DD>

<DD>
'The globe is the earth; the place we live on.'</DD>

<DD>
'Go on. Which quarter is Greenland?'</DD>

<DD>
'Greenland is no quarter. It is only a part of one.'</DD>

<DD>
'Maybe it's a half quarter.'</DD>

<DD>
'No, not so much as that.'</DD>

<DD>
'Half again?'</DD>

<DD>
'No!' he replied, smiling a little.</DD>

<DD>
She thought he was making it into a very small place in order to tease
her; so she pouted a little, and then said,--</DD>

<DD>
'Greenland is all t' geography I want to know. Except, perhaps, York. I'd
like to learn about York, because of t' races, and London, because King
George lives there.'</DD>

<DD>
'But if you learn geography at all, you must learn 'bout all places: which
of them is hot, and which is cold, and how many inhabitants is in each,
and what's the rivers, and which is the principal towns.'</DD>

<DD>
'I'm sure, Sylvie, if Philip will learn thee all that, thou'lt be such
a sight o' knowledge as ne'er a one o' th' Prestons has been sin' my great-grandfather
lost his property. I should be main proud o' thee; 'twould seem as if we
was Prestons o' Slaideburn once more.'</DD>

<DD>
'I'd do a deal to pleasure yo', mammy; but weary befa' riches and land,
if folks that has 'em is to write, "Abednegos" by t' score, and to get
hard words int' their brains, till they work like barm, and end wi' cracking
'em.'</DD>

<DD>
This seemed to be Sylvia's last protest against learning for the night,
for after this she turned docile, and really took pains to understand all
that Philip could teach her, by means of the not unskilful, though rude,
map which he drew for her with a piece of charred wood on his aunt's dresser.
He had asked his aunt's leave before beginning what Sylvia called his 'dirty
work;' but by-and-by even she became a little interested in starting from
a great black spot called Monkshaven, and in the shaping of land and sea
around that one centre. Sylvia held her round chin in the palms of her
hands, supporting her elbows on the dresser; looking down at the progress
of the rough drawing in general, but now and then glancing up at him with
sudden inquiry. All along he was not so much absorbed in his teaching as
to be unconscious of her sweet proximity. She was in her best mood towards
him; neither mutinous nor saucy; and he was striving with all his might
to retain her interest, speaking better than ever he had done before (such
brightness did love call forth!)--understanding what she would care to
hear and to know; when, in the middle of an attempt at explaining the cause
of the long polar days, of which she had heard from her childhood, he felt
that her attention was no longer his; that a discord had come in between
their minds; that she had passed out of his power. This certainty of intuition
lasted out for an instant; he had no time to wonder or to speculate as
to what had affected her so adversely to his wishes before the door opened
and Kinraid came in. Then Hepburn knew that she must have heard his coming
footsteps, and recognized them.</DD>

<DD>
He angrily stiffened himself up into coldness of demeanour. Almost to his
surprise, Sylvia's greeting to the new comer was as cold as his own. She
stood rather behind him; so perhaps she did not see the hand which Kinraid
stretched out towards her, for she did not place her own little palm in
it, as she had done to Philip an hour ago. And she hardly spoke, but began
to pore over the rough black map, as if seized with strong geographical
curiosity, or determined to impress Philip's lesson deep on her memory.</DD>

<DD>
Still Philip was dismayed by seeing the warm welcome which Kinraid received
from the master of the house, who came in from the back premises almost
at the same time as the specksioneer entered at the front. Hepburn was
uneasy, too, at finding Kinraid take his seat by the fireside, like one
accustomed to the ways of the house. Pipes were soon produced. Philip disliked
smoking. Possibly Kinraid did so too, but he took a pipe at any rate, and
lighted it, though he hardly used it at all, but kept talking to farmer
Robson on sea affairs. He had the conversation pretty much to himself.
Philip sat gloomily by; Sylvia and his aunt were silent, and old Robson
smoked his long clay pipe, from time to time taking it out of his mouth
to spit into the bright copper spittoon, and to shake the white ashes out
of the bowl. Before he replaced it, he would give a short laugh of relishing
interest in Kinraid's conversation; and now and then he put in a remark.'
Sylvia perched herself sideways on the end of the dresser, and made pretence
to sew; but Philip could see how often she paused in her work to listen.</DD>

<DD>
By-and-by, his aunt spoke to him, and they kept up a little side conversation,
more because Bell Robson felt that her nephew, her own flesh and blood,
was put out, than for any special interest they either of them felt in
what they were saying. Perhaps, also, they neither of them disliked showing
that they had no great faith in the stories Kinraid was telling. Mrs Robson,
at any rate, knew so little as to be afraid of believing too much.</DD>

<DD>
Philip was sitting on that side of the fire which was nearest to the window
and to Sylvia, and opposite to the specksioneer. At length he turned to
his cousin and said in a low voice--</DD>

<DD>
'I suppose we can t' go on with our spell at geography till that fellow's
gone?'</DD>

<DD>
The colour came into Sylvia's cheek at the words 'that fellow;' but she
only replied with a careless air--</DD>

<DD>
'Well, I'm one as thinks enough is as good as a feast; and I've had enough
of geography this one night, thank you kindly all the same.'</DD>

<DD>
Philip took refuge in offended silence. He was maliciously pleased when
his aunt made so much noise with her preparation for supper as quite to
prevent the sound of the sailor's words from reaching Sylvia's ears. She
saw that he was glad to perceive that her efforts to reach the remainder
of the story were baulked! this nettled her, and, determined not to let
him have his malicious triumph, and still more to put a stop to any attempt
at private conversation, she began to sing to herself as she sat at her
work; till, suddenly seized with a desire to help her mother, she dexterously
slipped down from her seat, passed Hepburn, and was on her knees toasting
cakes right in front of the fire, and just close to her father and Kinraid.
And now the noise that Hepburn had so rejoiced in proved his foe. He could
not hear the little merry speeches that darted backwards and forwards as
the specksioneer tried to take the toasting-fork out of Sylvia's hand.</DD>

<DD>
'How comes that sailor chap here?' asked Hepburn of his aunt. 'He's none
fit to be where Sylvia is.'</DD>

<DD>
'Nay, I dunnot know,' said she; 'the Corneys made us acquaint first, and
my master is quite fain of his company.'</DD>

<DD>
'And do you like him, too, aunt?' asked Hepburn, almost wistfully; he had
followed Mrs Robson into the dairy on pretence of helping her.</DD>

<DD>
'I'm none fond on him; I think he tells us traveller's tales, by way o'
seeing how much we can swallow. But the master and Sylvia think that there
never was such a one.'</DD>

<DD>
'I could show them a score as good as he down on the quayside.'</DD>

<DD>
'Well, laddie, keep a calm sough. Some folk like some folk and others don't.
Wherever I am there'll allays be a welcome for thee.'</DD>

<DD>
For the good woman thought that he had been hurt by the evident absorption
of her husband and daughter with their new friend, and wished to make all
easy and straight. But do what she would, he did not recover his temper
all evening: he was uncomfortable, put out, not enjoying himself, and yet
he would not go. He was determined to assert his greater intimacy in that
house by outstaying Kinraid. At length the latter got up to go; but before
he went, he must needs bend over Sylvia and say something to her in so
low a tone that Philip could not hear it; and she, seized with a sudden
fit of diligence, never looked up from her sewing; only nodded her head
by way of reply. At last he took his departure, after many a little delay,
and many a quick return, which to the suspicious Philip seemed only pretences
for taking stolen glances at Sylvia. As soon as he was decidedly gone,
she folded up her work, and declared that she was so much tired that she
must go to bed there and then. Her mother, too, had been dozing for the
last half-hour, and was only too glad to see signs that she might betake
herself to her natural place of slumber.</DD>

<DD>
'Take another glass, Philip,' said farmer Robson.</DD>

<DD>
But Hepburn refused the offer rather abruptly. He drew near to Sylvia instead.
He wanted to make her speak to him, and he saw that she wished to avoid
it. He took up the readiest pretext. It was an unwise one as it proved,
for it deprived him of his chances of occasionally obtaining her undivided
attention.</DD>

<DD>
'I don't think you care much for learning geography, Sylvie?'</DD>

<DD>
'Not much to-night,' said she, making a pretence to yawn, yet looking timidly
up at his countenance of displeasure.</DD>

<DD>
'Nor at any time,' said he, with growing anger; 'nor for any kind of learning.
I did bring some books last time I came, meaning to teach you many a thing
but now I'll just trouble you for my books; I put them on yon shelf by
the Bible.'</DD>

<DD>
He had a mind that she should bring them to him; that, at any rate, he
should have the pleasure of receiving them out of her hands.</DD>

<DD>
Sylvia did not reply, but went and took down the books with a languid,
indifferent air.</DD>

<DD>
'And so you won't learn any more geography,' said Hepburn.</DD>

<DD>
Something in his tone struck her, and she looked up in his. face. There
were marks of stern offence upon his countenance, and yet in it there was
also an air of wistful regret and sadness that touched her.</DD>

<DD>
'Yo're niver angry with me, Philip? Sooner than vex yo', I'll try and learn.
Only, I'm just stupid; and it mun be such a trouble to you.'</DD>

<DD>
Hepburn would fain have snatched at this half proposal that the lessons
should be continued, but he was too stubborn and proud to say anything.
He turned away from the sweet, pleading face without a word, to wrap up
his books in a piece of paper. He knew that she was standing quite still
by his side, though he made as if he did not perceive her. When he had
done he abruptly wished them all 'good-night,' and took his leave.</DD>

<DD>
There were tears in Sylvia's eyes, although the feeling in her heart was
rather one of relief. She had made a fair offer, and it had been treated
with silent contempt. A few days afterwards, her father came in from Monkshaven
market, and dropped out, among other pieces of news, that he had met Kinraid,
who was bound for his own home at Cullercoats. He had desired his respects
to Mrs Robson and her daughter; and had bid Robson say that he would have
come up to Haytersbank to wish them good-by, but that as he was pressed
for time, he hoped they would excuse him. But Robson did not think it worth
while to give this long message of mere politeness. Indeed, as it did not
relate to business, and was only sent to women, Robson forgot all about
it, pretty nearly as soon as it was uttered. So Sylvia went about fretting
herself for one or two days, at her hero's apparent carelessness of those
who had at any rate treated him more like a friend than an acquaintance
of only a few weeks' standing; and then, her anger quenching her incipient
regard, she went about her daily business pretty much as though he had
never been. He had gone away out of her sight into the thick mist of unseen
life from which he had emerged--gone away without a word, and she might
never see him again. But still there was a chance of her seeing him when
he came to marry Molly Corney. Perhaps she should be bridesmaid, and then
what a pleasant merry time the wedding-day would be! The Corneys were all
such kind people, and in their family there never seemed to be the checks
and restraints by which her own mother hedged her round. Then there came
an overwhelming self-reproaching burst of love for that 'own mother;' a
humiliation before her slightest wish, as penance for the moment's unspoken
treason; and thus Sylvia was led to request her cousin Philip to resume
his lessons in so meek a manner, that he slowly and graciously acceded
to a request which he was yearning to fulfil all the time.</DD>

<DD>
During the ensuing winter, all went on in monotonous regularity at Haytersbank
Farm for many weeks. Hepburn came and went, and thought Sylvia wonderfully
improved in docility and sobriety; and perhaps also he noticed the improvement
in her appearance. For she was at that age when a girl changes rapidly,
and generally for the better. Sylvia shot up into a tall young woman; her
eyes deepened in colour, her face increased in expression, and a sort of
consciousness of unusual good looks gave her a slight tinge of coquettish
shyness with the few strangers whom she ever saw. Philip hailed her interest
in geography as another sign of improvement. He had brought back his book
of maps to the farm; and there he sat on many an evening teaching his cousin,
who had strange fancies respecting the places about which she wished to
learn, and was coolly indifferent to the very existence of other towns,
and countries, an d seas far more famous in story. She was occasionally
wilful, and at times very contemptuous as to the superior knowledge of
her instructor; but, in spite of it all, Philip went regularly on the appointed
evenings to Haytersbank--through keen black east wind, or driving snow,
or slushing thaw; for he liked dearly to sit a little behind her, with
his arm on the back of her chair, she stooping over the outspread map,
with her eyes, could he have seen them, a good deal fixed on one spot in
the map, not Northumberland, where Kinraid was spending the winter, but
those wild northern seas about which he had told them such wonders.</DD>

<DD>
One day towards spring, she saw Molly Corney coming towards the farm. The
companions had not met for many weeks, for Molly had been from home visiting
her relations in the north. Sylvia opened the door, and stood smiling and
shivering on the threshold, glad to see her friend again. Molly called
out, when a few paces off,--</DD>

<DD>
'Why, Sylvia, is that thee! Why, how thou'rt growed, to be sure! What a
bonny lass thou is!'</DD>

<DD>
'Dunnot talk nonsense to my lass,' said Bell Robson, hospitably leaving
her ironing and coming to the door; but though the mother tried to look
as if she thought it nonsense, she could hardly keep down the smile that
shone out of her eyes, as she put her hand on Sylvia's shoulder, with a
fond sense of proprietorship in what was being praised.</DD>

<DD>
'Oh! but she is,' persisted Molly. 'She's grown quite a beauty sin' I saw
her. And if I don't tell her so, the men will.'</DD>

<DD>
'Be quiet wi' thee,' said Sylvia, more than half offended, and turning
away in a huff at the open barefaced admiration.</DD>

<DD>
'Ay; but they will,' persevered Molly. 'Yo'll not keep her long, Mistress
Robson. And as mother says, yo'd feel it a deal more to have yer daughters
left on hand.'</DD>

<DD>
'Thy mother has many, I have but this one,' said Mrs Robson, with severe
sadness; for now Molly was getting to talk as she disliked. But Molly's
purpose was to bring the conversation round to her own affairs, of which
she was very full.</DD>

<DD>
'Yes! I tell mother that wi' so many as she has, she ought to be thankful
to t' one as gets off quickest.'</DD>

<DD>
'Who? which is it?' asked Sylvia, a little eagerly, seeing that there was
news of a wedding behind the talk.</DD>

<DD>
'Why! who should it be but me?' said Molly, laughing a good deal, and reddening
a little. 'I've not gone fra' home for nought; I'se picked up a measter
on my travels, leastways one as is to be.'</DD>

<DD>
'Charley Kinraid,' said Sylvia smiling, as she found that now she might
reveal Molly's secret, which hitherto she had kept sacred.</DD>

<DD>
'Charley Kinraid be hung!' said Molly, with a toss of her head. 'Whatten
good's a husband who's at sea half t' year? Ha ha, my measter is a canny
Newcassel shopkeeper, on t' Side. A reckon a've done pretty well for mysel',
and a'll wish yo' as good luck, Sylvia. For yo' see,' (turning to Bell
Robson, who, perhaps, she thought would more appreciate the substantial
advantages of her engagement than Sylvia,) 'though Measter Brunton is near
upon forty if he's a day, yet he turns over a matter of two hundred pound
every year; an he's a good-looking man of his years too, an' a kind, good-tempered
feller int' t' bargain. He's been married once, to be sure; but his childer
are dead a' 'cept one; an' I don't mislike childer either; an' a'll feed
'em well, an' get 'em to bed early, out o' t' road.'</DD>

<DD>
Mrs Robson gave her her grave good wishes; but Sylvia was silent. She was
disappointed; it was a coming down from the romance with the specksioneer
for its hero. Molly laughed awkwardly, understanding Sylvia's thoughts
better than the latter imagined.</DD>

<DD>
'Sylvia's noane so well pleased. Why, lass! it's a' t' better for thee.
There's Charley to t' fore now, which if a'd married him, he'd not ha'
been; and he's said more nor once what a pretty lass yo'd grow into by-and-by.'</DD>

<DD>
Molly's prosperity was giving her an independence and fearlessness of talk
such as had seldom appeared hitherto; and certainly never before Mrs Robson.
Sylvia was annoyed at Molly's whole tone and manner, which were loud, laughing,
and boisterous; but to her mother they were positively repugnant. She said
shortly and gravely,--</DD>

<DD>
'Sylvia's none so set upo' matrimony; she's content to bide wi' me and
her father. Let a be such talking, it's not i' my way.'</DD>

<DD>
Molly was a little subdued; but still her elation at the prospect of being
so well married kept cropping out of all the other subjects which were
introduced; and when she went away, Mrs Robson broke out in an unwonted
strain of depreciation.</DD>

<DD>
'That's the way wi' some lasses. They're like a cock on a dunghill, when
they've teased a silly chap into wedding 'em. It's cock-a-doodle-do, I've
cotched a husband, cock-a-doodle-doo wi' 'em. I've no patience wi' such
like; I beg, Sylvie, thou'lt not get too thick wi' Molly. She's not pretty
behaved, making such an ado about men-kind, as if they were two-headed
calves to be run after.'</DD>

<DD>
'But Molly's a good-hearted lass, mother. Only I never dreamt but what
she was troth-plighted wi' Charley Kinraid,' said Sylvia, meditatively.</DD>

<DD>
'That wench 'll be troth-plight to th' first man as 'll wed her and keep
her i' plenty; that's a' she thinks about,' replied Bell, scornfully.</DD>
