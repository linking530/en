The morning brought more peace if it did not entirely dissipate fear. Daniel
seemed to have got over his irritability, and was unusually kind and tender
to wife and daughter, especially striving by silent little deeds to make
up for the sharp words he had said the night before to the latter.

<P>As if by common consent, all allusion to the Saturday night's proceedings
was avoided. They spoke of the day's work before them; of the crops to
be sown; of the cattle; of the markets; but each one was conscious of a
wish to know more distinctly what were the chances of the danger that,
to judge from Philip's words, hung over them, falling upon them and cutting
them off from all these places for the coming days.

<P>Bell longed to send Kester down into Monkshaven as a sort of spy to
see how the land lay; but she dared not manifest her anxiety to her husband,
and could not see Kester alone. She wished that she had told him to go
to the town, when she had had him to herself in the house-place the night
before; now it seemed as though Daniel were resolved not to part from him,
and as though both had forgotten that any peril had been anticipated. Sylvia
and her mother, in like manner, clung together, not speaking of their fears,
yet each knowing that it was ever present in the other's mind.

<P>So things went on till twelve o'clock--dinner-time. If at any time that
morning they had had the courage to speak together on the thought which
was engrossing all their minds, it is possible that some means might have
been found to avert the calamity that was coming towards them with swift
feet. But among the uneducated--the partially educated--nay, even the weakly
educated--the feeling exists which prompted the futile experiment of the
well-known ostrich. They imagine that, by closing their own eyes to apprehended
evil, they avert it. The expression of fear is supposed to accelerate the
coming of its cause. Yet, on the other hand, they shrink from acknowledging
the long continuance of any blessing, in the idea that when unusual happiness
is spoken about, it disappears. So, although perpetual complaints of past
or present grievances and sorrows are most common among this class, they
shrink from embodying apprehensions for the future in words, as if it then
took shape and drew near.

<P>They all four sate down to dinner, but not one of them was inclined
to eat. The food was scarcely touched on their plates, yet they were trying
to make talk among themselves as usual; they seemed as though they dared
not let themselves be silent, when Sylvia, sitting opposite to the window,
saw Philip at the top of the brow, running rapidly towards the farm. She
had been so full of the anticipation of some kind of misfortune all the
morning that she felt now as if this was the very precursive circumstance
she had been expecting; she stood up, turning quite white, and, pointing
with her finger, said,--

<P>'There he is!'

<P>Every one at table stood up too. An instant afterwards, Philip, breathless,
was in the room.

<P>He gasped out, 'They're coming! the warrant is out. You must go. I hoped
you were gone.'

<P>'God help us!' said Bell, and sate suddenly down, as if she had received
a blow that made her collapse into helplessness; but she got up again directly.

<P>Sylvia flew for her father's hat. He really seemed the most unmoved
of the party.

<P>'A'm noane afeared,' said he. 'A'd do it o'er again, a would; an' a'll
tell 'em so. It's a fine time o' day when men's to be trapped and carried
off, an' them as lays traps to set 'em free is to be put i' t' lock-ups
for it.'

<P>'But there was rioting, beside the rescue; t' house was burnt,' continued
eager, breathless Philip.

<P>'An' a'm noane goin' t' say a'm sorry for that, neyther; tho', mebbe,
a wouldn't do it again.'

<P>Sylvia had his hat on his head by this time; and Bell, wan and stiff,
trembling all over, had his over-coat, and his leather purse with the few
coins she could muster, ready for him to put on.

<P>He looked at these preparations, at his wife and daughter, and his colour
changed from its ruddy brown.

<P>'A'd face lock-ups, an' a fair spell o' jail, but for these,' said he,
hesitating.

<P>'Oh!' said Philip, 'for God's sake, lose no time, but be off.'

<P>'Where mun he go?' asked Bell, as if Philip must decide all.

<P>'Anywhere, anywhere, out of this house--say Haverstone. This evening,
I'll go and meet him there and plan further; only be off now.' Philip was
so keenly eager, he hardly took note at the time of Sylvia's one vivid
look of unspoken thanks, yet he remembered it afterwards.

<P>'A'll dang 'em dead,' said Kester, rushing to the door, for he saw what
the others did not--that all chance of escape was over; the constables
were already at the top of the little field-path not twenty yards off.

<P>'Hide him, hide him,' cried Bell, wringing her hands in terror; for
she, indeed they all, knew that flight would now be impossible. Daniel
was heavy, rheumatic, and, moreover, had been pretty severely bruised on
that unlucky night.

<P>Philip, without another word, pushed Daniel before him upstairs, feeling
that his own presence at Haytersbank Farm at that hour of the day would
be a betrayal. They had just time to shut themselves up in the larger bed-room,
before they heard a scuffle and the constables' entry downstairs.

<P>'They're in,' said Philip, as Daniel squeezed himself under the bed;
and then they held quite still, Philip as much concealed by the scanty,
blue-check curtain as he could manage to be. They heard a confusion of
voices below, a hasty moving of chairs, a banging of doors, a further parley,
and then a woman's scream, shrill and pitiful; then steps on the stairs.

<P>'That screech spoiled all,' sighed Philip.

<P>In one instant the door was opened, and each of the hiders was conscious
of the presence of the constables, although at first the latter stood motionless,
surveying the apparently empty room with disappointment. Then in another
moment they had rushed at Philip's legs, exposed as these were. They drew
him out with violence, and then let him go.

<P>'Measter Hepburn!' said one in amaze. But immediately they put two and
two together; for in so small a place as Monkshaven every one's relationships
and connections, and even likings, were known; and the motive of Philip's
coming out to Haytersbank was perfectly clear to these men.

<P>'T' other 'll not be far off,' said the other constable. 'His plate
were downstairs, full o' victual; a seed Measter Hepburn a-walking briskly
before me as a left Monkshaven'

<P>'Here he be, here he be,' called out the other man, dragging Daniel
out by his legs, 'we've getten him.'

<P>Daniel kicked violently, and came out from his hiding-place in a less
ignominious way than by being pulled out by his heels.

<P>He shook himself, and then turned, facing his captors.

<P>'A wish a'd niver hidden mysel'; it were his doing,' jerking his thumb
toward Philip: 'a'm ready to stand by what a've done. Yo've getten a warrant
a'll be bound, for them justices is grand at writin' when t' fight's over.'

<P>He was trying to carry it off with bravado, but Philip saw that he had
received a shock, from his sudden look of withered colour and shrunken
feature.

<P>'Don't handcuff him,' said Phi lip, putting money into the constable's
hand. 'You'll be able to guard him well enough without them things.'

<P>Daniel turned round sharp at this whisper.

<P>'Let-a-be, let-a-be, my lad,' he said. 'It 'll be summut to think on
i' t' lock-up how two able-bodied fellys were so afeared on t' chap as
reskyed them honest sailors o' Saturday neet, as they mun put him i' gyves,
and he sixty-two come Martinmas, and sore laid up wi' t' rheumatics.'

<P>But it was difficult to keep up this tone of bravado when he was led
a prisoner through his own house-place, and saw his poor wife quivering
and shaking all over with her efforts to keep back all signs of emotion
until he was gone; and Sylvia standing by her mother, her arm round Bell's
waist and stroking the poor shrunken fingers which worked so perpetually
and nervously in futile unconscious restlessness. Kester was in a corner
of the room, sullenly standing.

<P>Bell quaked from head to foot as her husband came downstairs a prisoner.
She opened her lips several times with an uneasy motion, as if she would
fain say something, but knew not what. Sylvia's passionate swollen lips
and her beautiful defiant eyes gave her face quite a new aspect; she looked
a helpless fury.

<P>'A may kiss my missus, a reckon,' said Daniel, coming to a standstill
as he passed near her.

<P>'Oh, Dannel, Dannel!' cried she, opening her arms wide to receive him.
'Dannel, Dannel, my man!' and she shook with her crying, laying her head
on his shoulder, as if he was all her stay and comfort.

<P>'Come, missus! come, missus!' said he, 'there couldn't be more ado if
a'd been guilty of murder, an' yet a say again, as a said afore, a'm noane
ashamed o' my doings. Here, Sylvie, lass, tak' thy mother off me, for a
cannot do it mysel', it like sets me off.' His voice was quavering as he
said this. But he cheered up a little and said, 'Now, good-by, oud wench
' (kissing her), ' and keep a good heart, and let me see thee lookin' lusty
and strong when a come back. Good-by, my lass; look well after mother,
and ask Philip for guidance if it's needed.'

<P>He was taken out of his home, and then arose the shrill cries of the
women; but in a minute or two they were checked by the return of one of
the constables, who, cap in hand at the sight of so much grief, said,--

<P>'He wants a word wi' his daughter.'

<P>The party had come to a halt about ten yards from the house. Sylvia,
hastily wiping her tears on her apron, ran out and threw her arms round
her father, as if to burst out afresh on his neck.

<P>'Nay, nay, my wench, it's thee as mun be a comfort to mother: nay, nay,
or thou'll niver hear what a've got to say. Sylvie, my lass, a'm main and
sorry a were so short wi' thee last neet; a ax thy pardon, lass, a were
cross to thee, and sent thee to thy bed wi' a sore heart. Thou munnot think
on it again, but forg'e me, now a'm leavin' thee.'

<P>'Oh, feyther! feyther!' was all Sylvia could say; and at last they had
to make as though they would have used force to separate her from their
prisoner. Philip took her hand, and softly led her back to her weeping
mother.

<P>For some time nothing was to be heard in the little farmhouse kitchen
but the sobbing and wailing of the women. Philip stood by silent, thinking,
as well as he could, for his keep sympathy with their grief, what had best
be done next. Kester, after some growls at Sylvia for having held back
the uplifted arm which he thought might have saved Daniel by a well-considered
blow on his captors as they entered the house, went back into his shippen--his
cell for meditation and consolation, where he might hope to soothe himself
before going out to his afternoon's work; labour which his master had planned
for him that very morning, with a strange foresight, as Kester thought,
for the job was one which would take him two or three days without needing
any further directions than those he had received, and by the end of that
time he thought that his master would be at liberty again. So he--so they
all thought in their ignorance and inexperience.

<P>Although Daniel himself was unreasoning, hasty, impulsive--in a word,
often thinking and acting very foolishly--yet, somehow, either from some
quality in his character, or from the loyalty of nature in those with whom
he had to deal in his every-day life, he had made his place and position
clear as the arbiter and law-giver of his household. On his decision, as
that of husband, father, master, perhaps superior natures waited. So now
that he was gone and had left them in such strange new circumstances so
suddenly, it seemed as though neither Bell nor Sylvia knew exactly what
to do when their grief was spent, so much had every household action and
plan been regulated by the thought of him. Meanwhile Philip had slowly
been arriving at the conclusion that he was more wanted at Monkshaven to
look after Daniel's interests, to learn what were the legal probabilities
in consequence of the old man's arrest, and to arrange for his family accordingly,
than standing still and silent in the Haytersbank kitchen, too full of
fellow-feeling and heavy foreboding to comfort, awkwardly unsympathetic
in appearance from the very aching of his heart.

<P>So when his aunt, with instinctive sense of regularity and propriety,
began to put away the scarcely tasted dinner, and Sylvia, blinded with
crying, and convulsively sobbing, was yet trying to help her mother, Philip
took his hat, and brushing it round and round with the sleeve of his coat,
said,--

<P>'I think I'll just go back, and see how matters stand.' He had a more
distinct plan in his head than these words implied, but it depended on
so many contingencies of which he was ignorant that he said only these
few words; and with a silent resolution to see them again that day, but
a dread of being compelled to express his fears, so far beyond theirs,
he went off without saying anything more. Then Sylvia lifted up her voice
with a great cry. Somehow she had expected him to do something--what, she
did not know; but he was gone, and they were left without stay or help.

<P>'Hush thee, hush thee,' said her mother, trembling all over herself;
'it's for the best. The Lord knows.'

<P>'But I niver thought he'd leave us,' moaned Sylvia, half in her mother's
arms, and thinking of Philip. Her mother took the words as applied to Daniel.

<P>'And he'd niver ha' left us, my wench, if he could ha' stayed.'

<P>'Oh, mother, mother, it's Philip as has left us, and he could ha' stayed.'

<P>'He'll come back, or mebbe send, I'll be bound. Leastways he'll be gone
to see feyther, and he'll need comfort most on all, in a fremd place--in
Bridewell--and niver a morsel of victual or a piece o' money.' And now
she sate down, and wept the dry hot tears that come with such difficulty
to the eyes of the aged. And so--first one grieving, and then the other,
and each draining her own heart of every possible hope by way of comfort,
alternately trying to cheer and console--the February afternoon passed
away; the continuous rain closing in the daylight even earlier than usual,
and adding to the dreariness, with the natural accompaniments of wailing
winds, coming with long sweeps over the moors, and making the sobbings
at the windows that always sound like the gasps of some one in great agony.
Meanwhile Philip had hastened back to Monkshaven. He had no umbrella, he
had to face the driving rain for the greater part of the way; but he was
thankful to the weather, for it kept men indoors, and he wanted to meet
no one, but to have time to think and mature his plans. The town itself
was, so to speak, in mourning. The rescue of the sailors was a distinctly
popular movement; the subsequent violence (which had, indeed, gone much
further than has been described, after Daniel left it) was, in general,
considered as only a kind of due punishment inflicted in wild justice on
the press-gang and their abettors. The feeling of the Monkshaven people
was, therefore, in decided opposition to the vigorous steps taken by the
county magistrates, who, in consequence of an appeal from the naval officers
in charge of the impressment service, had called out the militia (from
a distant and inland county) stationed within a few miles, and had thus
summarily quenched the riots that were continuing on the Sunday morning
after a somewhat languid fashion; the greater part of the destruction of
property having been accomplished during the previous night. Still there
was little doubt but that the violence would have been renewed as evening
drew on, and the more desperate part of the population and the enraged
sailors had had the Sabbath leisure to brood over their wrongs, and to
encourage each other in a passionate attempt at redress, or revenge. So
the authorities were quite justified in the decided steps they had taken,
both in their own estimation then, and now, in ours, looking back on the
affair in cold blood. But at the time feeling ran strongly against them;
and all means of expressing itself in action being prevented, men brooded
sullenly in their own houses. Philip, as the representative of the family,
the head of which was now suffering for his deeds in the popular cause,
would have met with more sympathy, ay, and more respect than he imagined,
as he went along the streets, glancing from side to side, fearful of meeting
some who would shy him as the relation of one who had been ignominiously
taken to Bridewell a few hours before. But in spite of this wincing of
Philip's from observation and remark, he never dreamed of acting otherwise
than as became a brave true friend. And this he did, and would have done,
from a natural faithfulness and constancy of disposition, without any special
regard for Sylvia.

<P>He knew his services were needed in the shop; business which he had
left at a moment's warning awaited him, unfinished; but at this time he
could not bear the torture of giving explanations, and alleging reasons
to the languid intelligence and slow sympathies of Coulson.

<P>He went to the offices of Mr Donkin, the oldest established and most
respected attorney in Monkshaven--he who had been employed to draw up the
law papers and deeds of partnership consequent on Hepburn and Coulson succeeding
to the shop of John and Jeremiah Foster, Brothers.

<P>Mr Donkin knew Philip from this circumstance. But, indeed, nearly every
one in Monkshaven knew each other; if not enough to speak to, at least
enough to be acquainted with the personal appearance and reputation of
most of those whom they met in the streets. It so happened that Mr Donkin
had a favourable opinion of Philip; and perhaps for this reason the latter
had a shorter time to wait before he obtained an interview with the head
of the house, than many of the clients who came for that purpose from town
or country for many miles round.

<P>Philip was ushered in. Mr Donkin sate with his spectacles pushed up
on his forehead, ready to watch his countenance and listen to his words.

<P>'Good afternoon, Mr Hepburn!'

<P>'Good afternoon, sir.' Philip hesitated how to begin. Mr Donkin became
impatient, and tapped with the fingers of his left hand on his desk. Philip's
sensitive nerves felt and rightly interpreted the action.

<P>'Please, sir, I'm come to speak to you about Daniel Robson, of Haytersbank
Farm.'

<P>'Daniel Robson?' said Mr Donkin, after a short pause, to try and compel
Philip into speed in his story.

<P>'Yes, sir. He's been taken up on account of this affair, sir, about
the press-gang on Saturday night.'

<P>'To be sure! I thought I knew the name.' And Mr Donkin's face became
grayer, and the expression more concentrated. Looking up suddenly at Philip,
he said, 'You are aware that I am the clerk to the magistrates?'

<P>'No, sir,' in a tone that indicated the unexpressed 'What then?'

<P>'Well, but I am. And so of course, if you want my services or advice
in favour of a prisoner whom they have committed, or are going to commit,
you can't have them, that's all.'

<P>'I am very sorry--very!' said Philip; and then he was again silent for
a period; long enough to make the busy attorney impatient.

<P>'Well, Mr Hepburn, have you anything else to say to me?'

<P>'Yes, sir. I've a deal to ask of you; for you see I don't rightly understand
what to do; and yet I'm all as Daniel's wife and daughter has to look to;
and I've their grief heavy on my heart. You could not tell me what is to
be done with Daniel, could you, sir?'

<P>'He'll be brought up before the magistrates to-morrow morning for final
examination, along with the others, you know, before he's sent to York
Castle to take his trial at the spring assizes.'

<P>'To York Castle, sir?'

<P>Mr Donkin nodded, as if words were too precious to waste.

<P>'And when will he go?' asked poor Philip, in dismay.

<P>'To-morrow: most probably as soon as the examination is over. The evidence
is clear as to his being present, aiding and abetting,--indicted on the
4th section of 1 George I., statute 1, chapter 5. I'm afraid it's a bad
look-out. Is he a friend of yours, Mr Hepburn?'

<P>'Only an uncle, sir,' said Philip, his heart getting full; more from
Mr Donkin's manner than from his words. 'But what can they do to him, sir?'

<P>'Do?' Mr Donkin half smiled at the ignorance displayed. 'Why, hang him,
to be sure; if the judge is in a hanging mood. He's been either a principal
in the offence, or a principal in the second degree, and, as such, liable
to the full punishment. I drew up the warrant myself this morning, though
I left the exact name to be filled up by my clerk.'

<P>'Oh, sir! can you do nothing for me?' asked Philip, with sharp beseeching
in his voice. He had never imagined that it was a capital offence; and
the thought of his aunt's and Sylvia's ignorance of the possible fate awaiting
him whom they so much loved, was like a stab to his heart.

<P>'No, my good fellow. I'm sorry; but, you see, it's my duty to do all
I can to bring criminals to justice.'

<P>'My uncle thought he was doing such a fine deed.'

<P>'Demolishing and pulling down, destroying and burning dwelling-houses
and outhouses,' said Mr Donkin. 'He must have some peculiar notions.'

<P>'The people is so mad with the press-gang, and Daniel has been at sea
hisself; and took it so to heart when he heard of mariners and seafaring
folk being carried off, and just cheated into doing what was kind and helpful--leastways,
what would have been kind and helpful, if there had been a fire. I'm against
violence and riots myself, sir, I'm sure; but I cannot help thinking as
Daniel had a deal to justify him on Saturday night, sir.'

<P>'Well; you must try and get a good lawyer to bring out all that side
of the question. There's a good deal to be said on it, but it's my duty
to get up all the evidence to prove that he and others were present on
the night in question; so, as you'll perceive, I can give you no help in
defending him.'

<P>'But who can, sir? I came to you as a friend who, I thought, would see
me through it. And I don't know any other lawyer; leastways, to speak to.'

<P>Mr Donkin was really more concerned for the misguided rioters than he
was aware; and he was aware of more interest than he cared to express.
So he softened his tone a little, and tried to give the best advice in
his power.

<P>'You'd better go to Edward Dawson on the other side of the river; he
that was articled clerk with me two years ago, you know. He's a clever
fellow, and has not too much practice; he'll do the best he can for you.
He'll have to be at the court-house, tell him, to-morrow morning at ten,
when the justices meet. He'll watch the case for you; and then he'll give
you his opinion, and tell you what to do. You can't do better than follow
his advice. I must do all I can to collect evidence for a conviction, you
know.'

<P>Philip stood up, looked at his hat, and then came forward and laid down
six and eightpence on the desk in a blushing, awkward way.

<P>'Pooh! pooh!' said Mr Donkin, pushing the money away. 'Don't be a fool;
you'll need it all before the trial's over. I've done nothing, man. It
would be a pretty thing for me to be feed by both parties.'

<P>Philip took up the money, and left the room. In an instant he came back
again, glanced furtively at Mr Donkin's face, and then, once more having
recourse to brushing his hat, he said, in a low voice--

<P>'You'll not be hard upon him, sir, I hope?'

<P>'I must do my duty,' replied Mr Donkin, a little sternly, 'without any
question of hardness.'

<P>Philip, discomfited, left the room; an instant of thought and Mr Donkin
had jumped up, and hastening to the door he opened it and called after
Philip.

<P>'Hepburn--Hepburn--I say, he'll be taken to York as soon as may be to-morrow
morning; if any one wants to see him before then, they'd better look sharp
about it.'

<P>Philip went quickly along the streets towards Mr Dawson's, pondering
upon the meaning of all that he had heard, and what he had better do. He
had made his plans pretty clearly out by the time he arrived at Mr Dawson's
smart door in one of the new streets on the other side of the river. A
clerk as smart as the door answered Philip's hesitating knock, and replied
to his inquiry as to whether Mr Dawson was at home, in the negative, adding,
after a moment's pause--

<P>'He'll be at home in less than an hour; he's only gone to make Mrs Dawson's
will--Mrs Dawson, of Collyton--she's not expected to get better.'

<P>Probably the clerk of an older-established attorney would not have given
so many particulars as to the nature of his master's employment; but, as
it happened it was of no consequence, the unnecessary information made
no impression on Philip's mind; he thought the matter over and then said--

<P>'I'll be back in an hour, then. It's gone a quarter to four; I'll be
back before five, tell Mr Dawson.'

<P>He turned on his heel and went back to the High Street as fast as he
could, with a far more prompt and decided step than before. He hastened
through the streets, emptied by the bad weather, to the principal inn of
the town, the George--the sign of which was fastened to a piece of wood
stretched across the narrow street; and going up to the bar with some timidity
(for the inn was frequented by the gentry of Monkshaven and the neighbourhood,
and was considered as a touch above such customers as Philip), he asked
if he could have a tax-cart made ready in a quarter of an hour, and sent
up to the door of his shop.

<P>'To be sure he could; how far was it to go?'

<P>Philip hesitated before he replied--

<P>'Up the Knotting Lane, to the stile leading down to Haytersbank Farm;
they'll have to wait there for some as are coming.'

<P>'They must not wait long such an evening as this; standing in such rain
and wind as there'll be up there, is enough to kill a horse.'

<P>'They shan't wait long,' said Philip, decisively: 'in a quarter of an
hour, mind.'

<P>He now went back to the shop, beating against the storm, which was increasing
as the tide came in and the night hours approached.

<P>Coulson had no word for him, but he looked reproachfully at his partner
for his long, unexplained absence. Hester was putting away the ribbons
and handkerchiefs, and bright-coloured things which had been used to deck
the window; for no more customers were likely to come this night through
the blustering weather to a shop dimly lighted by two tallow candles and
an inefficient oil-lamp. Philip came up to her, and stood looking at her
with unseeing eyes; but the strange consciousness of his fixed stare made
her uncomfortable, and called the faint flush to her pale cheeks, and at
length compelled her, as it were, to speak, and break the spell of the
silence. So, curiously enough, all three spoke at once. Hester asked (without
looking at Philip)--

<P>'Yo're sadly wet, I'm feared?'

<P>Coulson said--

<P>'Thou might have a bit o' news to tell one after being on the gad all
afternoon.'

<P>Philip whispered to Hester--

<P>'Wilt come into t' parlour? I want a word wi' thee by oursel's.'

<P>Hester quietly finished rolling up the ribbon she had in her hands when
he spoke, and then followed him into the room behind the shop before spoken
of.

<P>Philip set down on the table the candle which he had brought out of
the shop, and turning round to Hester, took her trembling hand into both
of his, and gripping it nervously, said--

<P>'Oh! Hester, thou must help me--thou will, will not thou?'

<P>Hester gulped down something that seemed to rise in her throat and choke
her, before she answered.

<P>'Anything, thou knows, Philip.'

<P>'Yes, yes, I know. Thou sees the matter is this: Daniel Robson--he who
married my aunt--is taken up for yon riot on Saturday night at t' Mariners'
Arms----'

<P>'They spoke on it this afternoon; they said the warrant was out,' said
Hester, filling up the sentence as Philip hesitated, lost for an instant
in his own thoughts.

<P>'Ay! the warrant is out, and he's in t' lock-up, and will be carried
to York Castle to-morrow morn; and I'm afeared it will go bad with him;
and they at Haytersbank is not prepared, and they must see him again before
he goes. Now, Hester, will thou go in a tax-cart as will be here in less
than ten minutes from t' George, and bring them back here, and they must
stay all night for to be ready to see him to-morrow before he goes? It's
dree weather for them, but they'll not mind that.'

<P>He had used words as if he was making a request to Hester; but he did
not seem to await her answer, so sure was he that she would go. She noticed
this, and noticed also that the rain was spoken of in reference to them,
not to her. A cold shadow passed over her heart, though it was nothing
more than she already knew--that Sylvia was the one centre of his thoughts
and his love.

<P>'I'll go put on my things at once,' said she, gently.

<P>Philip pressed her hand tenderly, a glow of gratitude overspread him.

<P>'Thou's a real good one, God bless thee!' said he. 'Thou must take care
of thyself, too,' continued he; 'there's wraps and plenty i' th' house,
and if there are not, there's those i' the shop as 'll be none the worse
for once wearing at such a time as this; and wrap thee well up, and take
shawls and cloaks for them, and mind as they put 'em on. Thou'll have to
get out at a stile, I'll tell t' driver where; and thou must get over t'
stile and follow t' path down two fields, and th' house is right before
ye, and bid 'em make haste and lock up th' house, for they mun stay all
night here. Kester 'll look after things.'

<P>All this time Hester was hastily putting on her hat and cloak, which
she had fetched from the closet where they usually hung through the day;
now she stood listening, as it were, for final directions.

<P>'But suppose they will not come,' said she; 'they dunnot know me, and
mayn't believe my words.'

<P>'They must,' said he, impatiently. 'They don't know what awaits 'em,'
he continued. 'I'll tell thee, because thou 'll not let out, and it seems
as if I mun tell some one--it were such a shock--he's to be tried for 's
life. They know not it's so serious; and, Hester,' said he, going on in
his search after sympathy, ' she's like as if she was bound up in her father.'

<P>His lips quivered as he looked wistfully into Hester's face at these
words. No need to tell her who was <I>she</I>. No need to put into words
the fact, told plainer than words could have spoken it, that his heart
was bound up in Sylvia.

<P>Hester's face, instead of responding to his look, contracted a little,
and, for the life of her, she could not have helped saying,--

<P>'Why don't yo' go yourself, Philip?'

<P>'I can't, I can't,' said he, impatiently. I'd give the world to go,
for I might be able to comfort her; but there's lawyers to see, and iver
so much to do, and they've niver a man friend but me to do it all. You'll
tell her,' said Philip, insinuatingly, as if a fresh thought had struck
him, 'as how I would ha' come. I would fain ha' come for 'em, myself, but
I couldn't, because of th' lawyer--mind yo' say because of th' lawyer.
I'd be loath for her to think I was minding any business of my own at this
time; and, whatever yo' do, speak hopeful, and, for t' life of yo', don't
speak of th' hanging, it's likely it's a mistake o' Donkin's; and anyhow--there's
t' cart--anyhow I should perhaps not ha' telled thee, but it's a comfort
to make a clean breast to a friend at times. God bless thee, Hester. I
don't know what I should ha' done without thee,' said he, as he wrapped
her well up in the cart, and placed the bundles of cloaks and things by
her side.

<P>Along the street, in the jolting cart, as long as Hester could see the
misty light streaming out of the shop door, so long was Philip standing
bareheaded in the rain looking after her. But she knew that it was not
her own poor self that attracted his lingering gaze. It was the thought
of the person she was bound to.
