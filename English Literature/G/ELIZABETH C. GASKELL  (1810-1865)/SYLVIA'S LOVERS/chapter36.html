That very evening Kester came, humbly knocking at the kitchen-door. Phoebe
opened it. He asked to see Sylvia.

<P>'A know not if she'll see thee,' said Phoebe. 'There's no makin' her
out; sometimes she's for one thing, sometimes she's for another.'

<P>'She bid me come and see her,' said Kester. 'Only this mornin', at missus'
buryin', she telled me to come.'

<P>So Phoebe went off to inform Sylvia that Kester was there; and returned
with the desire that he would walk into the parlour. An instant after he
was gone, Phoebe heard him return, and carefully shut the two doors of
communication between the kitchen and sitting-room.

<P>Sylvia was in the latter when Kester came in, holding her baby close
to her; indeed, she seldom let it go now-a-days to any one else, making
Nancy's place quite a sinecure, much to Phoebe's indignation.

<P>Sylvia's face was shrunk, and white, and thin; her lovely eyes alone
retained the youthful, almost childlike, expression. She went up to Kester,
and shook his horny hand, she herself trembling all over.

<P>'Don't talk to me of her,' she said hastily. 'I cannot stand it. It's
a blessing for her to be gone, but, oh----'

<P>She began to cry, and then cheered herself up, and swallowed down her
sobs.

<P>'Kester,' she went on, hastily, 'Charley Kinraid isn't dead; dost ta
know? He's alive, and he were here o' Tuesday--no, Monday, was it? I cannot
tell--but he were here!'

<P>'A knowed as he weren't dead. Every one is a-speaking on it. But a didn't
know as thee'd ha' seen him. A took comfort i' thinkin' as thou'd ha' been
wi' thy mother a' t' time as he were i' t' place.'

<P>'Then he's gone?' said Sylvia.

<P>'Gone; ay, days past. As far as a know, he but stopped a' neet. A thought
to mysel' (but yo' may be sure a said nought to nobody), he's heerd as
our Sylvia were married, and has put it in his pipe, and ta'en hissel'
off to smoke it.'

<P>'Kester!' said Sylvia, leaning forwards, and whispering. 'I saw him.
He was here. Philip saw him. Philip had known as he wasn't dead a' this
time!'

<P>Kester stood up suddenly.

<P>'By goom, that chap has a deal t' answer for.'

<P>A bright red spot was on each of Sylvia's white cheeks; and for a minute
or so neither of them spoke.

<P>Then she went on, still whispering out her words.

<P>'Kester, I'm more afeared than I dare tell any one: can they ha' met,
think yo'? T' very thought turns me sick. I told Philip my mind, and took
a vow again' him--but it would be awful to think on harm happening to him
through Kinraid. Yet he went out that morning, and has niver been seen
or heard on sin'; and Kinraid were just fell again' him, and as for that
matter, so was I; but----'

<P>The red spot vanished as she faced her own imagination.

<P>Kester spoke.

<P>'It's a thing as can be easy looked into. What day an' time were it
when Philip left this house?'

<P>'Tuesday--the day she died. I saw him in her room that morning between
breakfast and dinner; I could a'most swear to it's being close after eleven.
I mind counting t' clock. It was that very morn as Kinraid were here.'

<P>'A'll go an' have a pint o' beer at t' King's Arms, down on t' quay-side;
it were theere he put up at. An' a'm pretty sure as he only stopped one
night, and left i' t' morning betimes. But a'll go see.'

<P>'Do,' said Sylvia, 'and go out through t' shop; they're all watching
and watching me to see how I take things; and daren't let on about t' fire
as is burning up my heart. Coulson is i' t' shop, but he'll not notice
thee like Phoebe.'

<P>By-and-by Kester came back. It seemed as though Sylvia had never stirred;
she looked eagerly at him, but did not speak.

<P>'He went away i' Rob Mason's mail-cart, him as tak's t' letters to Hartlepool.
T' lieutenant (as they ca' him down at t' King's Arms; they're as proud
on his uniform as if it had been a new-painted sign to swing o'er their
doors), t' lieutenant had reckoned upo' stayin' longer wi' 'em; but he
went out betimes o' Tuesday morn', an' came back a' ruffled up, an paid
his bill--paid for his breakfast, though he touched noane on it--an' went
off i' Rob postman's mail-cart, as starts reg'lar at ten o'clock. Corneys
has been theere askin' for him, an' makin' a piece o' work, as he niver
went near em; and they bees cousins. Niver a one among 'em knows as he
were here as far as a could mak' out.'

<P>'Thank yo', Kester,' said Sylvia, falling back in her chair, if all
the energy that had kept her stiff and upright was gone now that her anxiety
was relieved.

<P>She was silent for a long time; her eyes shut, her cheek laid on her
child's head. Kester spoke next.

<P>'A think it's pretty clear as they'n niver met. But its a' t' more wonder
where thy husband's gone to. Thee and him had words about it, and thou
telled him thy mind, thou said?'

<P>'Yes,' said Sylvia, not moving. 'I'm afeared lest mother knows what
I said to him, there, where she's gone to--I am-' the tears filled her
shut eyes, and came softly overflowing down her cheeks; 'and yet it were
true, what I said, I cannot forgive him; he's just spoilt my life, and
I'm not one-and-twenty yet, and he knowed how wretched, how very wretched,
I were. A word fra' him would ha' mended it a'; and Charley had bid him
speak the word, and give me his faithful love, and Philip saw my heart
ache day after day, and niver let on as him I was mourning for was alive,
and had sent me word as he'd keep true to me, as I were to do to him.'

<P>'A wish a'd been theere; a'd ha' felled him to t' ground,' said Kester,
clenching his stiff, hard hand with indignation.

<P>Sylvia was silent again: pale and weary she sate, her eyes still shut.

<P>Then she said,

<P>'Yet he were so good to mother; and mother loved him so. Oh, Kester!'
lifting herself up, opening her great wistful eyes, 'it's well for folks
as can die; they're spared a deal o' misery.'

<P>'Ay!' said he. 'But there's folk as one 'ud like to keep fra' shirkin'
their misery. Think yo' now as Philip is livin'?'

<P>Sylvia shivered all over, and hesitated before she replied.

<P>'I dunnot know. I said such things; he deserved 'em all----'

<P>'Well, well, lass!' said Kester, sorry that he had asked the question
which was producing so much emotion of one kind or another. 'Neither thee
nor me can tell; we can neither help nor hinder, seem' as he's ta'en hissel'
off out on our sight, we'd best not think on him. A'll try an' tell thee
some news, if a can think on it wi' my mind so full. Thou knows Haytersbank
folk ha' flitted, and t' oud place is empty?'

<P>'Yes!' said Sylvia, with the indifference of one wearied out with feeling.

<P>'A only telled yo' t' account like for me bein' at a loose end i' Monkshaven.
My sister, her as lived at Dale End an' is a widow, has comed int' town
to live; an' a'm lodging wi' her, an' jobbin' about. A'm gettin' pretty
well to do, an' a'm noane far t' seek, an' a'm going now: only first a
just wanted for t' say as a'm thy oldest friend, a reckon, and if a can
do a turn for thee, or go an errand, like as a've done to-day, or if it's
any comfort to talk a bit to one who's known thy life from a babby, why
yo've only t' send for me, an' a'd come if it were twenty mile. A'm lodgin'
at Peggy Dawson's, t' lath and plaster cottage at t' right hand o' t' bridge,
a' among t' new houses, as they're thinkin' o' buildin' near t' sea: no
one can miss it.'

<P>He stood up and shook hands with her. As he did so, he looked at her
sleeping baby.

<P>'She's liker yo' than him. A think a'll say, God bless her.'

<P>With the heavy sound of his out-going footsteps, baby awoke. She ought
before this time to have been asleep in her bed, and the disturbance made
her cry fretfully.

<P>'Hush thee, darling, hush thee!' murmured her mother; 'there's no one
left to love me but thee, and I cannot stand thy weeping, my pretty one.
Hush thee, my babe, hush thee!'

<P>She whispered soft in the little one's ear as she took her upstairs
to bed.

<P>About three weeks after the miserable date of Bell Robson's death and
Philip's disappearance, Hester Rose received a letter from him. She knew
the writing on the address well; and it made her tremble so much that it
was many minutes before she dared to open it, and make herself acquainted
with the facts it might disclose.

<P>But she need not have feared; there were no facts told, unless the vague
date of 'London' might be something to learn. Even that much might have
been found out by the post-mark, only she had been too much taken by surprise
to examine it.

<P>It ran as follows:--

<P>'DEAR HESTER,--

<P>'Tell those whom it may concern, that I have left Monkshaven for ever.
No one need trouble themselves about me; I am provided for. Please to make
my humble apologies to my kind friends, the Messrs Foster, and to my partner,
William Coulson. Please to accept of my love, and to join the same to your
mother. Please to give my particular and respectful duty and kind love
to my aunt Isabella Robson. Her daughter Sylvia knows what I have always
felt, and shall always feel, for her better than I can ever put into language,
so I send her no message; God bless and keep my child. You must all look
on me as one dead; as I am to you, and maybe shall soon be in reality.

<P>'Your affectionate and obedient friend to command,
<CENTER>'PHILIP HEPBURN.</CENTER>


<P>'P.S.--Oh, Hester! for God's sake and mine, look after' ('my wife,'
scratched out) 'Sylvia and my child. I think Jeremiah Foster will help
you to be a friend to them. This is the last solemn request of P. H. She
is but very young.

<P>Hester read this letter again and again, till her heart caught the echo
of its hopelessness, and sank within her. She put it in her pocket, and
reflected upon it all the day long as she served in the shop.

<P>The customers found her as gentle, but far more inattentive than usual.
She thought that in the evening she would go across the bridge, and consult
with the two good old brothers Foster. But something occurred to put off
the fulfilment of this plan.

<P>That same morning Sylvia had preceded her, with no one to consult, because
consultation would have required previous confidence, and confidence would
have necessitated such a confession about Kinraid as it was most difficult
for Sylvia to make. The poor young wife yet felt that some step must be
taken by her; and what it was to be she could not imagine.

<P>She had no home to go to; for as Philip was gone away, she remained
where she was only on sufferance; she did not know what means of livelihood
she had; she was willing to work, nay, would be thankful to take up her
old life of country labour; but with her baby, what could she do?

<P>In this dilemma, the recollection of the old man's kindly speech and
offer of assistance, made, it is true, half in joke, at the end of her
wedding visit, came into her mind; and she resolved to go and ask for some
of the friendly counsel and assistance then offered.

<P>It would be the first time of her going out since her mother's funeral,
and she dreaded the effort on that account. More even than on that account
did she shrink from going into the streets again. She could not get over
the impression that Kinraid must be lingering near; and she distrusted
herself so much that it was a positive terror to think of meeting him again.
She felt as though, if she but caught a sight of him, the glitter of his
uniform, or heard his well-known voice in only a distant syllable of talk,
her heart would stop, and she should die from very fright of what would
come next. Or rather so she felt, and so she thought before she took her
baby in her arms, as Nancy gave it to her after putting on its out-of-door
attire.

<P>With it in her arms she was protected, and the whole current of her
thoughts was changed. The infant was wailing and suffering with its teething,
and the mother's heart was so occupied in soothing and consoling her moaning
child, that the dangerous quay-side and the bridge were passed almost before
she was aware; nor did she notice the eager curiosity and respectful attention
of those she met who recognized her even through the heavy veil which formed
part of the draping mourning provided for her by Hester and Coulson, in
the first unconscious days after her mother's death.

<P>Though public opinion as yet reserved its verdict upon Philip's disappearance--warned
possibly by Kinraid's story against hasty decisions and judgments in such
times as those of war and general disturbance--yet every one agreed that
no more pitiful fate could have befallen Philip's wife.

<P>Marked out by her striking beauty as an object of admiring interest
even in those days when she sate in girlhood's smiling peace by her mother
at the Market Cross--her father had lost his life in a popular cause, and
ignominious as the manner of his death might be, he was looked upon as
a martyr to his zeal in avenging the wrongs of his townsmen; Sylvia had
married amongst them too, and her quiet daily life was well known to them;
and now her husband had been carried off from her side just on the very
day when she needed his comfort most.

<P>For the general opinion was that Philip had been 'carried off'--in seaport
towns such occurrences were not uncommon in those days--either by land-crimps
or water-crimps.

<P>So Sylvia was treated with silent reverence, as one sorely afflicted,
by all the unheeded people she met in her faltering walk to Jeremiah Foster's.

<P>She had calculated her time so as to fall in with him at his dinner
hour, even though it obliged her to go to his own house rather than to
the bank where he and his brother spent all the business hours of the day.

<P>Sylvia was so nearly exhausted by the length of her walk and the weight
of her baby, that all she could do when the door was opened was to totter
into the nearest seat, sit down, and begin to cry.

<P>In an instant kind hands were about her, loosening her heavy cloak,
offering to relieve her of her child, who clung to her all the more firmly,
and some one was pressing a glass of wine against her lips.

<P>'No, sir, I cannot take it! wine allays gives me th' headache; if I
might have just a drink o' water. Thank you, ma-am' (to the respectable-looking
old servant), 'I'm well enough now; and perhaps, sir, I might speak a word
with yo', for it's that I've come for.'

<P>'It's a pity, Sylvia Hepburn, as thee didst not come to me at the bank,
for it's been a long toil for thee all this way in the heat, with thy child.
But if there's aught I can do or say for thee, thou hast but to name it,
I am sure. Martha! wilt thou relieve her of her child while she comes with
me into the parlour?'

<P>But the wilful little Bella stoutly refused to go to any one, and Sylvia
was not willing to part with her, tired though she was.

<P>So the baby was carried into the parlour, and much of her after-life
depended on this trivial fact.

<P>Once installed in the easy-chair, and face to face with Jeremiah, Sylvia
did not know how to begin.

<P>Jeremiah saw this, and kindly gave her time to recover herself, by pulling
out his great gold watch, and letting the seal dangle before the child's
eyes, almost within reach of the child's eager little fingers.

<P>'She favours you a deal,' said he, at last. 'More than her father,'
he went on, purposely introducing Philip's name, so as to break the ice;
for 'he rightly conjectured she had come to speak to him about something
connected with her husband.

<P>Still Sylvia said nothing; she was choking down tears and shyness, and
unwillingness to take as confidant a man of whom she knew so little, on
such slight ground (as she now felt it to be) as the little kindly speech
with which she had been dismissed from that house the last time that she
entered it.

<P>'It's no use keeping yo', sir,' she broke out at last. 'It's about Philip
as I comed to speak. Do yo' know any thing whatsoever about him? He niver
had a chance o' saying anything, I know; but maybe he's written?'

<P>'Not a line, my poor young woman!' said Jeremiah, hastily putting an
end to that vain idea.

<P>'Then he's either dead or gone. away for iver,' she whispered. 'I mun
be both feyther and mother to my child.'

<P>'Oh! thee must not give it up,' replied he. 'Many a one is carried off
to the wars, or to the tenders o' men-o'-war; and then they turn out to
be unfit for service, and are sent home. Philip 'll come back before the
year's out; thee'll see that.'

<P>'No; he'll niver come back. And I'm not sure as I should iver wish him
t' come back, if I could but know what was gone wi' him. Yo' see, sir,
though I were sore set again' him, I shouldn't like harm to happen him.'

<P>'There is something behind all this that I do not understand. Can thee
tell me what it is?'

<P>'I must, sir, if yo're to help me wi' your counsel; and I came up here
to ask for it.'

<P>Another long pause, during which Jeremiah made a feint of playing with
the child, who danced and shouted with tantalized impatience at not being
able to obtain possession of the seal, and at length stretched out her
soft round little arms to go to the owner of the coveted possession. Surprise
at this action roused Sylvia, and she made some comment upon it.

<P>'I niver knew her t' go to any one afore. I hope she'll not be troublesome
to yo', sir?'

<P>The old man, who had often longed for a child of his own in days gone
by, was highly pleased by this mark of baby's confidence, and almost forgot,
in trying to strengthen her regard by all the winning wiles in his power,
how her poor mother was still lingering over some painful story which she
could not bring herself to tell.

<P>'I'm afeared of speaking wrong again' any one, sir. And mother were
so fond o' Philip; but he kept something from me as would ha' made me a
different woman, and some one else, happen, a different man. I were troth-plighted
wi' Kinraid the specksioneer, him as was cousin to th' Corneys o' Moss
Brow, and comed back lieutenant i' t' navy last Tuesday three weeks, after
ivery one had thought him dead and gone these three years.'

<P>She paused.

<P>'Well?' said Jeremiah, with interest; although his attention appeared
to be divided between the mother's story and the eager playfulness of the
baby on his knee.

<P>'Philip knew he were alive; he'd seen him taken by t' press-gang, and
Charley had sent a message to me by Philip.'

<P>Her white face was reddening, her eyes flashing at this point of her
story.

<P>'And he niver told me a word on it, not when he saw me like to break
my heart in thinking as Kinraid were dead; he kept it a' to hissel'; and
watched me cry, and niver said a word to comfort me wi' t' truth. It would
ha' been a great comfort, sir, only t' have had his message if I'd niver
ha' been to see him again. But Philip niver let on to any one, as I iver
heared on, that he'd seen Charley that morning as t' press-gang took him.
Yo' know about feyther's death, and how friendless mother and me was left?
and so I married him; for he were a good friend to us then, and I were
dazed like wi' sorrow, and could see naught else to do for mother. He were
allays very tender and good to her, for sure.'

<P>Again a long pause of silent recollection, broken by one, or two deep
sighs.

<P>'If I go on, sir, now, I mun ask yo' to promise as yo'll niver tell.
I do so need some one to tell me what I ought to do, and I were led here,
like, else I would ha' died wi' it all within my teeth. Yo'll promise,
sir?'

<P>Jeremiah Foster looked in her face, and seeing the wistful, eager look,
he was touched almost against his judgment into giving the promise required;
she went on.

<P>'Upon a Tuesday morning, three weeks ago, I think, tho' for t' matter
o' time it might ha' been three years, Kinraid come home; come back for
t' claim me as his wife, and I were wed to Philip! I met him i' t' road
at first; and I couldn't tell him theere. He followed me into t' house--Philip's
house, sir, behind t' shop--and somehow I told him all, how I were a wedded
wife to another. Then he up and said I'd a false heart--me false, sir,
as had eaten my daily bread in bitterness, and had wept t' nights through,
all for sorrow and mourning for his death! Then he said as Philip knowed
all t' time he were alive and coming back for me; and I couldn't believe
it, and I called Philip, and he come, and a' that Charley had said were
true; and yet I were Philip's wife! So I took a mighty oath, and I said
as I'd niver hold Philip to be my lawful husband again, nor iver forgive
him for t' evil he'd wrought us, but hold him as a stranger and one as
had done me a heavy wrong.'

<P>She stopped speaking; her story seemed to her to end there. But her
listener said, after a pause,

<P>'It were a cruel wrong, I grant thee that; but thy oath were a sin,
and thy words were evil, my poor lass. What happened next?'

<P>'I don't justly remember,' she said, wearily. 'Kinraid went away, and
mother cried out; and I went to her. She were asleep, I thought, so I lay
down by her, to wish I were dead, and to think on what would come on my
child if I died; and Philip came in softly, and I made as if I were asleep;
and that's t' very last as I've iver seen or heared of him.'

<P>Jeremiah Foster groaned as she ended her story. Then he pulled himself
up, and said, in a cheerful tone of voice,

<P>'He'll come back, Sylvia Hepburn. He'll think better of it: never fear!'

<P>'I fear his coming back!' said she. 'That's what I'm feared on; I would
wish as I knew on his well-doing i' some other place; but him and me can
niver live together again.'

<P>'Nay,' pleaded Jeremiah. 'Thee art sorry what thee said; thee were sore
put about, or thee wouldn't have said it.'

<P>He was trying to be a peace-maker, and to heal over conjugal differences;
but he did not go deep enough.

<P>'I'm not sorry,' said she, slowly. 'I were too deeply wronged to be
"put about;" that would go off wi' a night's sleep. It's only the thought
of mother (she's dead and happy, and knows nought of all this, I trust)
that comes between me and hating Philip. I'm not sorry for what I said.'

<P>Jeremiah had never met with any one so frank and undisguised in expressions
of wrong feeling, and he scarcely knew what to say.

<P>He looked extremely grieved, and not a little shocked. So pretty and
delicate a young creature to use such strong relentless language!

<P>She seemed to read his thoughts, for she made answer to them.

<P>'I dare say you think I'm very wicked, sir, not to be sorry. Perhaps
I am. I can't think o' that for remembering how I've suffered; and he knew
how miserable I was, and might ha' cleared my misery away wi' a word; and
he held his peace, and now it's too late! I'm sick o' men and their cruel,
deceitful ways. I wish I were dead.'

<P>She was crying before she had ended this speech, and seeing her tears,
the child began to cry too, stretching out its little arms to go back to
its mother. The hard stony look on her face melted away into the softest,
tenderest love as she clasped the little one to her, and tried to soothe
its frightened sobs.

<P>A bright thought came into the old man's mind.

<P>He had been taking a complete dislike to her till her pretty way with
her baby showed him that she had a heart of flesh within her.

<P>'Poor little one!' said he, 'thy mother had need love thee, for she's
deprived thee of thy father's love. Thou'rt half-way to being an orphan;
yet I cannot call thee one of the fatherless to whom God will be a father.
Thou'rt a desolate babe, thou may'st well cry; thine earthly parents have
forsaken thee, and I know not if the Lord will take thee up.'

<P>Sylvia looked up at him affrighted; holding her baby tighter to her,
she exclaimed.

<P>'Don't speak so, sir! it's cursing, sir! I haven't forsaken her! Oh,
sir! those are awful sayings.'

<P>'Thee hast sworn never to forgive thy husband, nor to live with him
again. Dost thee know that by the law of the land, he may claim his child;
and then thou wilt have to forsake it, or to be forsworn? Poor little maiden!'
continued he, once more luring the baby to him with the temptation of the
watch and chain.

<P>Sylvia thought for a while before speaking. Then she said,

<P>'I cannot tell what ways to take. Whiles I think my head is crazed.
It were a cruel turn he did me!'

<P>'It was. I couldn't have thought him guilty of such baseness.'

<P>This acquiescence, which was perfectly honest on Jeremiah's part, almost
took Sylvia by surprise. Why might she not hate one who had been both cruel
and base in his treatment of her? And yet she recoiled from the application
of such hard terms by another to Philip, by a cool-judging and indifferent
person, as she esteemed Jeremiah to be. From some inscrutable turn in her
thoughts, she began to defend him, or at least to palliate the harsh judgment
which she herself had been the first to pronounce.

<P>'He were so tender to mother; she were dearly fond on him; he niver
spared aught he could do for her, else I would niver ha' married him.'

<P>'He was a good and kind-hearted lad from the time he was fifteen. And
I never found him out in any falsehood, no more did my brother.'

<P>'But it were all the same as a lie,' said Sylvia, swiftly changing her
ground, 'to leave me to think as Charley were dead, when he knowed all
t' time he were alive.'

<P>'It was. It was a self-seeking lie; putting thee to pain to get his
own ends. And the end of it has been that he is driven forth like Cain.'

<P>'I niver told him to go, sir.'

<P>'But thy words sent him forth, Sylvia.'

<P>'I cannot unsay them, sir; and I believe as I should say them again.'

<P>But she said this as one who rather hopes for a contradiction.

<P>All Jeremiah replied, however, 'was, 'Poor wee child!' in a pitiful
tone, addressed to the baby.

<P>Sylvia's eyes filled with tears.

<P>'Oh, sir, I'll do anything as iver yo' can tell me for her. That's what
I came for t' ask yo'. I know I mun not stay theere, and Philip gone away;
and I dunnot know what to do: and I'll do aught, only I must keep her wi'
me. Whativer can I do, sir?'

<P>Jeremiah thought it over for a minute or two. Then he replied,

<P>'I must have time to think. I must talk it over with brother John.'

<P>'But you've given me yo'r word, sir!' exclaimed she.

<P>'I have given thee my word never to tell any one of what has passed
between thee and thy husband, but I must take counsel with my brother as
to what is to be done with thee and thy child, now that thy husband has
left the shop.'

<P>This was said so gravely as almost to be a reproach, and he got up,
as a sign that the interview was ended.

<P>He gave the baby back to its mother; but not without a solemn blessing,
so solemn that, to Sylvia's superstitious and excited mind, it undid the
terrors of what she had esteemed to be a curse.

<P>'The Lord bless thee and keep thee! The Lord make His face to shine
upon thee!'

<P>All the way down the hill-side, Sylvia kept kissing the child, and whispering
to its unconscious ears,--

<P>'I'll love thee for both, my treasure, I will. I'll hap thee round wi'
my love, so as thou shall niver need a feyther's.'
