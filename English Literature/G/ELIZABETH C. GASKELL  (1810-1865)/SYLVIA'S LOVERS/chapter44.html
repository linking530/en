<DD>
It was the spring of 1800. Old people yet can tell of the hard famine of
that year. The harvest of the autumn before had failed; the war and the
corn laws had brought the price of corn up to a famine rate; and much of
what came into the market was unsound, and consequently unfit for food,
yet hungry creatures bought it eagerly, and tried to cheat disease by mixing
the damp, sweet, clammy flour with rice or potato meal. Rich families denied
themselves pastry and all unnecessary and luxurious uses of wheat in any
shape; the duty on hair-powder was increased; and all these palliatives
were but as drops in the ocean of the great want of the people.</DD>

<DD>
Philip, in spite of himself, recovered and grew stronger; and as he grew
stronger hunger took the place of loathing dislike to food. But this money
was all spent; and what was his poor pension of sixpence a day in that
terrible year of famine? Many a summer's night he walked for hours and
hours round the house which once was his, which might be his now, with
all its homely, blessed comforts, could he but go and assert his right
to it. But to go with authority, and in his poor, maimed guise assert that
right, he had need be other than Philip Hepburn. So he stood in the old
shelter of the steep, crooked lane opening on to the hill out of the marketplace,
and watched the soft fading of the summer's eve into night; the closing
of the once familiar shop; the exit of good, comfortable William Coulson,
going to his own home, his own wife, his comfortable, plentiful supper.
Then Philip--there were no police in those days, and scarcely an old watchman
in that primitive little town--would go round on the shady sides of streets,
and, quickly glancing about him, cross the bridge, looking on the quiet,
rippling stream, the grey shimmer foretelling the coming dawn over the
sea, the black masts and rigging of the still vessels against the sky;
he could see with his wistful, eager eyes the shape of the windows--the
window of the very room in whim his wife and child slept, unheeding of
him, the hungry, broken-hearted outcast. He would go back to his lodging,
and softly lift the latch of the door; still more softly, but never without
an unspoken, grateful prayer, pass by the poor sleeping woman who had given
him a shelter and her share of God's blessing--she who, like him, knew
not the feeling of satisfied hunger; and then he laid him down on the narrow
pallet in the lean-to, and again gave Sylvia happy lessons in the kitchen
at Haytersbank, and the dead were alive; and Charley Kinraid, the specksioneer,
had never come to trouble the hopeful, gentle peace.</DD>

<DD>
For widow Dobson had never taken Sylvia's advice. The tramp known to her
by the name of Freeman--that in which he received his pension--lodged with
her still, and paid his meagre shilling in advance, weekly. A shilling
was meagre in those hard days of scarcity. A hungry man might easily eat
the produce of a shilling in a day.</DD>

<DD>
Widow Dobson pleaded this to Sylvia as an excuse for keeping her lodger
on; to a more calculating head it might have seemed a reason for sending
him away.</DD>

<DD>
'Yo' see, missus,' said she, apologetically, to Sylvia, one evening, as
the latter called upon the poor widow before going to fetch little Bella
(it was now too hot for the child to cross the bridge in the full heat
of the summer sun, and Jeremiah would take her up to her supper instead)--'Yo'
see, missus, there's not a many as 'ud take him in for a shillin' when
it goes so little way; or if they did, they'd take it out on him some other
way, an' he's not getten much else, a reckon. He ca's me granny, but a'm
vast mista'en if he's ten year younger nor me; but he's getten a fine appetite
of his own, choose how young he may be; an' a can see as he could eat a
deal more nor he's getten money to buy, an' it's few as can mak' victual
go farther nor me. Eh, missus, but yo' may trust me a'll send him off when
times is better; but just now it would be sendin' him to his death; for
a ha' plenty and to spare, thanks be to God an' yo'r bonny face.'</DD>

<DD>
So Sylvia had to be content with the knowledge that the money she gladly
gave to Kester's sister went partly to feed the lodger who was neither
labourer nor neighbour, but only just a tramp, who, she feared, was preying
on the good old woman. Still the cruel famine cut sharp enough to penetrate
all hearts; and Sylvia, an hour after the conversation recorded above,
was much touched, on her return from Jeremiah Foster's with the little
merry, chattering Bella, at seeing the feeble steps of one, whom she knew
by description must be widow Dobson's lodger, turn up from the newly-cut
road which was to lead to the terrace walk around the North Cliff, a road
which led to no dwelling but widow Dobson's. Tramp, and vagrant, he might
he in the eyes of the law; but, whatever his character, Sylvia could see
him before her in the soft dusk, creeping along, over the bridge, often
stopping to rest and hold by some support, and then going on again towards
the town, to which she and happy little Bella were wending.</DD>

<DD>
A thought came over her: she had always fancied that this unknown man was
some fierce vagabond, and had dreaded lest in the lonely bit of road between
widow Dobson's cottage and the peopled highway, he should fall upon her
and rob her if he learnt that she had money with her; and several times
she had gone away without leaving the little gift she had intended, because
she imagined that she had seen the door of the small chamber in the 'lean-to'
open softly while she was there, as if the occupant (whom widow Dobson
spoke of as never leaving the house before dusk, excepting once a week)
were listening for the chink of the coin in her little leathern purse.
Now that she saw him walking before her with heavy languid steps, this
fear gave place to pity; she remembered her mother's gentle superstition
which had prevented her from ever sending the hungry empty away, for fear
lest she herself should come to need bread.</DD>

<DD>
'Lassie,' said she to little Bella, who held a cake which Jeremiah's housekeeper
had given her tight in her hand, 'yon poor man theere is hungry; will Bella
give him her cake, and mother will make her another to-morrow twice as
big?'</DD>

<DD>
For this consideration, and with the feeling of satisfaction which a good
supper not an hour ago gives even to the hungry stomach of a child of three
years old, Bella, after some thought, graciously assented to the sacrifice.</DD>

<DD>
Sylvia stopped, the cake in her hand, and turned her back to the town,
and to the slow wayfarer in front. Under the cover of her shawl she slipped
a half-crown deep into the crumb of the cake, and then restoring it to
little Bella, she gave her her directions.</DD>

<DD>
'Mammy will carry Bella; and when Bella goes past the poor man, she shall
give him the cake over mammy's shoulder. Poor man is so hungry; and Bella
and mammy have plenty to eat, and to spare.'</DD>

<DD>
The child's heart was touched by the idea of hunger, and her little arm
was outstretched ready for the moment her mother's hurried steps took her
brushing past the startled, trembling Philip.</DD>

<DD>
'Poor man, eat this; Bella not hungry.'</DD>

<DD>
They were the first words he had ever heard his child utter. The echoes
of them rang in his ears as he stood endeavouring to hide his disfigured
face by looking over the parapet of the bridge down upon the stream running
away towards the ocean, into which his hot tears slowly fell, unheeded
by the weeper. Then he changed the intention with which he had set out
upon his nightly walk, and turned back to his lodging.</DD>

<DD>
Of course the case was different with Sylvia; she would have forgotten
the whole affair very speedily, if it had not been for little Bella's frequent
recurrence to the story of the hungry man, which had touched her small
sympathies with the sense of an intelligible misfortune. She liked to act
the dropping of the bun into the poor man's hand as she went past him,
and would take up any article near her in order to illustrate the gesture
she had used. One day she got hold of Hester's watch for this purpose,
as being of the same round shape as the cake; and though Hester, for whose
benefit the child was repeating the story in her broken language for the
third or fourth time, tried to catch the watch as it was intended that
she should (she being the representative of the 'hungry man' for the time
being), it went to the ground with a smash that frightened the little girl,
and she began to cry at the mischief she had done.</DD>

<DD>
'Don't cry, Bella,' said Hester. 'Niver play with watches again. I didn't
see thee at mine, or I'd ha' stopped thee in time. But I'll take it to
old Darley's on th' quay-side, and maybe he'll soon set it to rights again.
Only Bella must niver play with watches again.'</DD>

<DD>
'Niver no more!' promised the little sobbing child. And that evening Hester
took her watch down to old Darley's.</DD>

<DD>
This William Darley was the brother of the gardener at the rectory; the
uncle to the sailor who had been shot by the press-gang years before, and
to his bed-ridden sister. He was a clever mechanician, and his skill as
a repairer of watches and chronometers was great among the sailors, with
whom he did a very irregular sort of traffic, conducted. often without
much use of money, but rather on the principle of barter, they bringing
him foreign coins and odd curiosities picked up on their travels in exchange
for his services to their nautical instruments or their watches. If he
had ever had capital to extend his business, he might have been a rich
man; but it is to be doubted whether he would have been as happy as he
was now in his queer little habitation of two rooms, the front one being
both shop and workshop, the other serving the double purpose of bed-room
and museum.</DD>

<DD>
The skill of this odd-tempered, shabby old man was sometimes sought by
the jeweller who kept the more ostentatious shop in the High Street; but
before Darley would undertake any 'tickle' piece of delicate workmanship
for the other, he sneered at his ignorance, and taunted and abused him
well. Yet he had soft places in his heart, and Hester Rose had found her
way to one by her patient, enduring kindness to his bedridden niece. He
never snarled at her as he did at too many; and on the few occasions when
she had asked him to do anything for her, he had seemed as if she were
conferring the favour on him, not he on her, and only made the smallest
possible charge.</DD>

<DD>
She found him now sitting where he could catch the most light for his work,
spectacles on nose, and microscope in hand.</DD>

<DD>
He took her watch, and examined it carefully without a word in reply to
her. Then he began to open it and take it to pieces, in order to ascertain
the nature of the mischief.</DD>

<DD>
Suddenly he heard her catch her breath with a checked sound of surprise.
He looked at her from above his spectacles; she was holding a watch in
her hand which she had just taken up off the counter.</DD>

<DD>
'What's amiss wi' thee now?' said Darley. ' Hast ta river seen a watch
o' that mak' afore? or is it them letters on t' back, as is so wonderful?'</DD>

<DD>
Yes, it was those letters--that interlaced, old-fashioned cipher. That
Z. H. that she knew of old stood for Zachary Hepburn, Philip's father.
She knew how Philip valued this watch. She remembered having seen it in
his hands the very day before his disappearance, when he was looking at
the time in his annoyance at Sylvia's detention in her walk with baby.
Hester had no doubt that he had taken this watch as a matter of course
away with him. She felt sure that he would not part with this relic of
his dead father on any slight necessity. Where, then, was Philip?--by what
chance of life or death had this, his valued property, found its way once
more to Monkshaven?</DD>

<DD>
'Where did yo' get this?' she asked, in as quiet a manner as she could
assume, sick with eagerness as she was.</DD>

<DD>
To no one else would Darley have answered such a question. He made a mystery
of most of his dealings; not that he had anything to conceal, but simply
because he delighted in concealment. He took it out of her hands, looked
at the number marked inside, and the maker's name--'Natteau Gent, York'--and
then replied,--</DD>

<DD>
'A man brought it me yesterday, at nightfall, for t' sell it. It's a matter
o' forty years old. Natteau Gent has been dead and in his grave pretty
nigh as long as that. But he did his work well when he were alive; and
so I gave him as brought it for t' sell about as much as it were worth,
i' good coin. A tried him first i' t' bartering line, but he wouldn't bite;
like enough he wanted food,--many a one does now-a-days.'</DD>

<DD>
'Who was he?' gasped Hester.</DD>

<DD>
'Bless t' woman! how should I know?'</DD>

<DD>
'What was he like?--how old?--tell me.'</DD>

<DD>
'My lass, a've summut else to do wi' my eyes than go peering into men's
faces i' t' dusk light.'</DD>

<DD>
'But yo' must have had light for t' judge about the watch.'</DD>

<DD>
'Eh! how sharp we are! A'd a candle close to my nose. But a didn't tak'
it up for to gaze int' his face. That wouldn't be manners, to my thinking.'</DD>

<DD>
Hester was silent. Then Darley's heart relented.</DD>

<DD>
'If yo're so set upo' knowing who t' fellow was, a could, mebbe, put yo'
on his tracks.'</DD>

<DD>
'How?' said Hester, eagerly. 'I do want to know. I want to know very much,
and for a good reason.'</DD>

<DD>
'Well, then a'll tell yo'. He's a queer tyke, that one is. A'll be bound
he were sore pressed for t' brass; yet he out's wi' a good half-crown,
all wrapped up i' paper, and he axes me t' make a hole in it. Says I, "It's
marring good king's coin, at after a've made a hole in't, it'll never pass
current again." So he mumbles, and mumbles, but for a' that it must needs
be done; and he's left it here, and it t' call for 't to-morrow at e'en.'</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, William Darley!' said Hester, clasping her hands tight together. 'Find
out who he is, where he is--anything--everything about him--and I will
so bless yo'.'</DD>

<DD>
Darley looked at her sharply, but with some signs of sympathy on his grave
face. 'My woman,' he said 'a could ha' wished as you'd niver seen t' watch.
It's poor, thankless work thinking too much on one o' God's creatures.
But a'll do thy bidding,' he continued, in a lighter and different tone.
'A'm a 'cute old badger when need be. Come for thy watch in a couple o'
days, and a'll tell yo' all as a've learnt.'</DD>

<DD>
So Hester went away, her heart beating with the promise of knowing something
about Philip,--how much, how little, in these first moments, she dared
not say even to herself. Some sailor newly landed from distant seas might
have become possessed of Philip's watch in far-off latitudes; in which
case, Philip would be dead. That might be. She tried to think that this
was the most probable way of accounting for the watch. She could be certain
as to the positive identity of the watch--being in William Darley's possession..
Again, it might be that Philip himself was near at hand--was here in this
very place--starving, as too many were, for insufficiency of means to buy
the high-priced food. And then her heart burnt within her as she thought
of the succulent, comfortable meals which Sylvia provided every day--nay,
three times a day--for the household in the market-place, at the head of
which Philip ought to have been; but his place knew him not. For Sylvia
had inherited her mother's talent for housekeeping, and on her, in Alice's
decrepitude and Hester's other occupations in the shop, devolved the cares
of due provision for the somewhat heterogeneous family.</DD>

<DD>
And Sylvia! Hester groaned in heart over the remembrance of Sylvia's words,
'I can niver forgive him the wrong he did to me,' that night when Hester
had come, and clung to her, making the sad, shameful confession of her
unreturned love.</DD>

<DD>
What could ever bring these two together again? Could Hester herself--ignorant
of the strange mystery of Sylvia's heart, as those who are guided solely
by obedience to principle must ever be of the clue to the actions of those
who are led by the passionate ebb and flow of impulse? Could Hester herself?
Oh! how should she speak, how should she act, if Philip were near--if Philip
were sad and in miserable estate? Her own misery at this contemplation
of the case was too great to bear; and she sought her usual refuge in the
thought of some text, some promise of Scripture, which should strengthen
her faith.</DD>

<DD>
'With God all things are possible,' said she, repeating the words as though
to lull her anxiety to rest.</DD>

<DD>
Yes; with God all things are possible. But oftentimes He does his work
with awful instruments. There is a peacemaker whose name is Death.</DD>
