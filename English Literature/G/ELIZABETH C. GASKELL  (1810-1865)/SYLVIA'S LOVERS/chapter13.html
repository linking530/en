Coulson and Philip were friendly, but not intimate. They never had had
a dispute, they never were confidential with each other; in truth, they
were both reserved and silent men, and, probably, respected each other
the more for being so self-contained. There was a private feeling in Coulson's
heart which would have made a less amiable fellow dislike Philip. But of
this the latter was unconscious: they were not apt to exchange many words
in the room which they occupied jointly.

<P>Coulson asked Philip if he had enjoyed himself at the Corneys', and
Philip replied,--

<P>'Not much; such parties are noane to my liking.'

<P>'And yet thou broke off from t' watch-night to go there.'

<P>No answer; so Coulson went on, with a sense of the duty laid upon him,
to improve the occasion--the first that had presented itself since the
good old Methodist minister had given his congregation the solemn warning
to watch over the opportunities of various kinds which the coming year
would present.

<P>'Jonas Barclay told us as the pleasures o' this world were like apples
o' Sodom, pleasant to look at, but ashes to taste.'

<P>Coulson wisely left Philip to make the application for himself. If he
did he made no sign, but threw himself on his bed with a heavy sigh.

<P>'Are yo' not going to undress?' said Coulson, as he covered him up in
bed.

<P>There had been a long pause of silence. Philip did not answer him, and
he thought he had fallen asleep. But he was roused from his first slumber
by Hepburn's soft movements about the room. Philip had thought better of
it, and, with some penitence in his heart for his gruffness to the unoffending
Coulson, was trying not to make any noise while he undressed.

<P>But he could not sleep. He kept seeing the Corneys' kitchen and the
scenes that had taken place in it, passing like a pageant before his closed
eyes. Then he opened them in angry weariness at the recurring vision, and
tried to make out the outlines of the room and the furniture in the darkness.
The white ceiling sloped into the whitewashed walls, and against them he
could see the four rush-bottomed chairs, the looking-glass hung on one
side, the old carved oak-chest (his own property, with the initials of
forgotten ancestors cut upon it), which held his clothes; the boxes that
belonged to Coulson, sleeping soundly in the bed in the opposite corner
of the room; the casement window in the roof, through which the snowy ground
on the steep hill-side could be plainly seen; and when he got so far as
this in the catalogue of the room, he fell into a troubled feverish sleep,
which lasted two or three hours; and then he awoke with a start, and a
consciousness of uneasiness, though what about he could not remember at
first.

<P>When he recollected all that had happened the night before, it impressed
him much more favourably than it had done at the time. If not joy, hope
had come in the morning; and, at any rate, he could be up and be doing,
for the late wintry light was stealing down the hill-side, and he knew
that, although Coulson lay motionless in his sleep, it was past their usual
time of rising. Still, as it was New Year's Day, a time of some licence,
Philip had mercy on his fellow-shopman, and did not waken him till just
as he was leaving the room.

<P>Carrying his shoes in his hand, he went softly downstairs for he could
see from the top of the flight that neither Alice nor her daughter was
down yet, as the kitchen shutters were not unclosed. It was Mrs Rose's
habit to rise early, and have all bright and clean against her lodgers
came down; but then, in general, she went to rest before nine o'clock,
whereas the last night she had not gone till past twelve. Philip went about
undoing the shutters, and trying to break up the raking coal, with as little
noise as might be, for he had compassion on the tired sleepers. The kettle
had not been filled, probably because Mrs Rose had been unable to face
the storm of the night before, in taking it to the pump just at the entrance
of the court. When Philip came back from filling it, he found Alice and
Hester both in the kitchen, and trying to make up for lost time by hastening
over their work. Hester looked busy and notable with her gown pinned up
behind her, and her hair all tucked away under a clean linen cap; but Alice
was angry with herself for her late sleeping, and that and other causes
made her speak crossly to Philip, as he came in with his snowy feet and
well-filled kettle.

<P>'Look the' there! droppin' and drippin' along t' flags as was cleaned
last night, and meddlin' wi' woman's work as a man has no business wi'.'

<P>Philip was surprised and annoyed. He had found relief from his own thoughts
in doing what he believed would help others. He gave up the kettle to her
snatching hands, and sate down behind the door in momentary ill-temper.
But the kettle was better filled, and consequently heavier than the old
woman expected, and she could not manage to lift it to the crook from which
it generally hung suspended. She looked round for Hester, but she was gone
into the back-kitchen. In a minute Philip was at her side, and had heaved
it to its place for her. She looked in his face for a moment wistfully,
but hardly condescended to thank him; at least the sound of the words did
not pass the lips that formed them. Rebuffed by her manner, he went back
to his old seat, and mechanically watched the preparations for breakfast;
but his thoughts went back to the night before, and the comparative ease
of his heart was gone. The first stir of a new day had made him feel as
if he had had no sufficient cause for his annoyance and despondency the
previous evening; but now, condemned to sit quiet, he reviewed looks and
words, and saw just reason for his anxiety. After some consideration he
resolved to go that very night to Haytersbank, and have some talk with
either Sylvia or her mother; what the exact nature of this purposed conversation
should be, he did not determine; much would depend on Sylvia's manner and
mood, and on her mother's state of health; but at any rate something would
be learnt.

<P>During breakfast something was learnt nearer home; though not all that
a man less unconscious and more vain than Philip might have discovered.
He only found out that Mrs Rose was displeased with him for not having
gone to the watch-night with Hester, according to the plan made some weeks
before. But he soothed his conscience by remembering that he had made no
promise; he had merely spoken of his wish to be present at the service,
about which Hester was speaking; and although at the time and for a good
while afterwards, he had fully intended going, yet as there had been William
Coulson to accompany her, his absence could not have been seriously noticed.
Still he was made uncomfortable by Mrs Rose's change of manner; once or
twice he said to himself that she little knew how miserable he had been
during his 'gay evening,' as she would persist in calling it, or she would
not talk at him with such persevering bitterness this morning. Before he
left for the shop, he spoke of his intention of going to see how his aunt
was, and of paying her a New Year's Day visit.

<P>Hepburn and Coulson took it in turns week and week about to go first
home to dinner; the one who went first sate down with Mrs Rose and her
daughter instead of having his portion put in the oven to keep warm for
him. To-day it was Hepburn's turn to be last. All morning the shop was
full with customers, come rather to offer good wishes than to buy, and
with an unspoken remembrance of the cake and wine which the two hospitable
brothers Foster made a point of offering to all comers on New Year's Day.
It was busy work for all--for Hester on her side, where caps, ribbons,
and women's gear were exclusively sold--for the shopmen and boys in the
grocery and drapery department. Philip was trying to do his business with
his mind far away; and the consequence was that his manner was not such
as to recommend him to the customers, some of whom recollected it as very
different, courteous and attentive, if grave and sedate. One buxom farmer's
wife noticed the change to him. She had a little girl with her, of about
five years old, that she had lifted up on the counter; and who was watching
Philip with anxious eyes, occasionally whispering in her mother's ear,
and then hiding her face against her cloak.

<P>'She's thought a deal o' coming to see yo', and a dunnot think as yo'
mind her at all. My pretty, he's clean forgotten as how he said last New
Year's Day, he'd gi' thee a barley-sugar stick, if thou'd hem him a handkercher
by this.'

<P>The child's face was buried in the comfortable breadth of duffle at
these words, while the little outstretched hand held a small square of
coarse linen.

<P>'Ay, she's noane forgotten it, and has done her five stitches a day,
bless her; and a dunnot believe as yo' know her again. She's Phoebe Moorsom,
and a'm Hannah, and a've dealt at t' shop reg'lar this fifteen year.'

<P>'I'm very sorry,' said Philip. 'I was up late last night, and I'm a
bit dazed to-day. Well! this is nice work, Phoebe, and I'm sure I'm very
much beholden to yo'. And here's five sticks o' barley-sugar, one for every
stitch, and thank you kindly, Mrs Moorsom, too.'

<P>Philip took the handkerchief and hoped he had made honourable amends
for his want of recognition. But the wee lassie refused to be lifted down,
and whispered something afresh into her mother's ear, who smiled and bade
her be quiet. Philip saw, however, that there was some wish ungratified
on the part of the little maiden which he was expected to inquire into,
and, accordingly, he did his duty.

<P>'She's a little fool; she says yo' promised to gi'e her a kiss, and
t' make her yo'r wife.'

<P>The child burrowed her face closer into her mother's neck, and refused
to allow the kiss which Philip willingly offered. All he could do was to
touch the back of the little white fat neck with his lips. The mother carried
her off only half satisfied, and Philip felt that he must try and collect
his scattered wits, and be more alive to the occasion.

<P>Towards the dinner-hour the crowd slackened; Hester began to replenish
decanters and bottles, and to bring out a fresh cake before she went home
to dinner; and Coulson and Philip looked over the joint present they always
made to her on this day. It was a silk handkerchief of the prettiest colours
they could pick out of the shop, intended for her to wear round her neck.
Each tried to persuade the other to give it to her, for each was shy of
the act of presentation. Coulson was, however, the most resolute; and when
she returned from the parlour the little parcel was in Philip's hands.

<P>'Here, Hester,' said he, going round the counter to her, just as she
was leaving the shop. 'It's from Coulson and me; a handkerchief for yo'
to wear; and we wish yo' a happy New Year, and plenty on 'em; and there's
many a one wishes the same.'

<P>He took her hand as he said this. She went a little paler, and her eyes
brightened as though they would fill with tears as they met his; she could
not have helped it, do what she would. But she only said, 'Thank yo' kindly,'
and going up to Coulson she repeated the words and action to him; and then
they went off together to dinner.

<P>There was a lull of business for the next hour. John and Jeremiah were
dining like the rest of the world. Even the elder errand-boy had vanished.
Philip rearranged disorderly goods; and then sate down on the counter by
the window; it was the habitual place for the one who stayed behind; for
excepting on market-day there was little or no custom during the noon-hour.
Formerly he used to move the drapery with which the window was ornamented,
and watch the passers-by with careless eye. But now, though he seemed to
gaze abroad, he saw nothing but vacancy. All the morning since he got up
he had been trying to fight through his duties--leaning against a hope--a
hope that first had bowed, and then had broke as soon as he really tried
its weight. There was not a sign of Sylvia's liking for him to be gathered
from the most careful recollection of the past evening. It was of no use
thinking that there was. It was better to give it up altogether and at
once. But what if he could not? What if the thought of her was bound up
with his life; and that once torn out by his own free will, the very roots
of his heart must come also?

<P>No; he was resolved he would go on; as long as there was life there
was hope; as long as Sylvia remained unpledged to any one else, there was
a chance for him. He would remodel his behaviour to her. He could not be
merry and light-hearted like other young men; his nature was not cast in
that mould: and the early sorrows that had left him a lonely orphan might
have matured, but had not enlivened, his character. He thought with some
bitterness on the power of easy talking about trifles which some of those
he had met with at the Corneys' had exhibited. But then he felt stirring
within him a force of enduring love which he believed to be unusual, and
which seemed as if it must compel all things to his wish in the end. A
year or so ago he had thought much of his own cleverness and his painfully
acquired learning, and he had imagined that these were the qualities which
were to gain Sylvia. But now, whether he had tried them and had failed
to win even her admiration, or whether some true instinct had told him
that a woman's love may be gained in many ways sooner than by mere learning,
he was only angry with himself for his past folly in making himself her
school--nay, her taskmaster. To-night, though, he would start off on a
new tack. He would not even upbraid her for her conduct the night before;
he had shown her his displeasure at the time; but she should see how tender
and forgiving he could be. He would lure her to him rather than find fault
with her. There had perhaps been too much of that already.

<P>When Coulson came back Philip went to his solitary dinner. In general
he was quite alone while eating it; but to-day Alice Rose chose to bear
him company. She watched him with cold severe eye for some time, until
he had appeased his languid appetite. Then she began with the rebuke she
had in store for him; a rebuke the motives to which were not entirely revealed
even to herself.

<P>'Thou 're none so keen after thy food as common,' she began. 'Plain
victuals goes ill down after feastin'.'

<P>Philip felt the colour mount to his face; he was not in the mood for
patiently standing the brunt of the attack which he saw was coming, and
yet he had a reverent feeling for woman and for age. He wished she would
leave him alone; but he only said--'I had nought but a slice o' cold beef
for supper, if you'll call that feasting.'

<P>'Neither do godly ways savour delicately after the pleasures of the
world,' continued she, unheeding his speech. 'Thou wert wont to seek the
house of the Lord, and I thought well on thee; but of late thou'st changed,
and fallen away, and I mun speak what is in my heart towards thee.'

<P>'Mother,' said Philip, impatiently (both he and Coulson called Alice
'mother' at times), 'I don't think J am fallen away, and any way I cannot
stay now to be--it's New Year's Day, and t' shop is throng.'

<P>But Alice held up her hand. Her speech was ready, and she must deliver
it.

<P>'Shop here, shop there. The flesh and the devil are gettin' hold on
yo', and yo' need more nor iver to seek t' ways o' grace. New Year's Day
comes and says, "Watch and pray," and yo' say, "Nay, I'll seek feasts and
market-places, and let times and seasons come and go without heedin' into
whose presence they're hastening me." Time was, Philip, when thou'd niver
ha' letten a merry-making keep thee fra' t' watch-night, and t' company
o' the godly.'

<P>'I tell yo' it was no merry-making to me,' said Philip, with sharpness,
as he left the house.

<P>Alice sat down on the nearest seat, and leant her head on her wrinkled
hand.

<P>'He's tangled and snared,' said she; 'my heart has yearned after him,
and I esteemed him as one o' the elect. And more nor me yearns after him.
O Lord, I have but one child! O Lord, spare her! But o'er and above a'
I would like to pray for his soul, that Satan might not have it, for he
came to me but a little lad.'

<P>At that moment Philip, smitten by his conscience for his hard manner
of speech, came back; but Alice did not hear or see him till he was close
by her, and then he had to touch her to recall her attention.

<P>'Mother,' said he, 'I was wrong. I'm fretted by many things. I shouldn't
ha' spoken so. It was ill-done of me.'

<P>'Oh, my lad!' said she, looking up and putting her thin arm on his shoulder
as he stooped, 'Satan is desiring after yo' that he may sift yo' as wheat.
Bide at whoam, bide at whoam, and go not after them as care nought for
holy things. Why need yo' go to Haytersbank this night?'

<P>Philip reddened. He could not and would not give it up, and yet it was
difficult to resist the pleading of the usually stern old woman.

<P>'Nay,' said he, withdrawing himself ever so little from her hold; 'my
aunt is but ailing, they're my own flesh and blood, and as good folks as
needs be, though they mayn't be o' our--o' your way o' thinking in a' things.'

<P>'Our ways--your ways o' thinking, says he, as if they were no longer
his'n. And as good folks as need be,' repeated she, with returning severity.
'Them's Satan's words, tho' yo' spoke 'em, Philip. I can do nought again
Satan, but I can speak to them as can; an' we'll see which pulls hardest,
for it'll be better for thee to be riven and rent i' twain than to go body
and soul to hell.'

<P>'But don't think, mother,' said Philip, his last words of conciliation,
for the clock had given warning for two, 'as I'm boun' for hell, just because
I go t' see my own folks, all I ha' left o' kin.' And once more, after
laying his hand with as much of a caress as was in his nature on hers,
he left the house.

<P>Probably Alice would have considered the first words that greeted Philip
on his entrance into the shop as an answer to her prayer, for they were
such as put a stop to his plan of going to see Sylvia that evening; and
if Alice had formed her inchoate thoughts into words, Sylvia would have
appeared as the nearest earthly representative of the spirit of temptation
whom she dreaded for Philip.

<P>As he took his place behind the counter, Coulson said to him in a low
voice,--

<P>'Jeremiah Foster has been round to bid us to sup wi' him to-night. He
says that he and John have a little matter o' business to talk over with
us.'

<P>A glance from his eyes to Philip told the latter that Coulson believed
the business spoken of had something to do with the partnership, respecting
which there had been a silent intelligence for some time between the shopmen.

<P>'And what did thou say?' asked Philip, doggedly unwilling, even yet,
to give up his purposed visit.

<P>'Say! why, what could a say, but that we'd come? There was summat up,
for sure; and summat as he thought we should be glad on. I could tell it
fra' t' look on his face.'

<P>'I don't think as I can go,' said Philip, feeling just then as if the
long-hoped-for partnership was as nothing compared to his plan. It was
always distasteful to him to have to give up a project, or to disarrange
an intended order of things, such was his nature; but to-day it was absolute
pain to yield his own purpose.

<P>'Why, man alive?' said Coulson, in amaze at his reluctance.

<P>'I didn't say I mightn't go,' said Philip, weighing consequences, until
called off to attend to customers.

<P>In the course of the afternoon, however, he felt himself more easy in
deferring his visit to Haytersbank till the next evening. Charley Kinraid
entered the shop, accompanied by Molly Brunton and her sisters; and though
they all went towards Hester's side of the shop, and Philip and Coulson
had many people to attend to, yet Hepburn's sharpened ears caught much
of what the young women were saying. From that he gathered that Kinraid
had promised them New Year's gifts, for the purchase of which they were
come; and after a little more listening he learnt that Kinraid was returning
to Shields the next day, having only come over to spend a holiday with
his relations, and being tied with ship's work at the other end. They all
talked together lightly and merrily, as if his going or staying was almost
a matter of indifference to himself and his cousins. The principal thought
of the young women was to secure the articles they most fancied; Charley
Kinraid was (so Philip thought) especially anxious that the youngest and
prettiest should be pleased. Hepburn watched him perpetually with a kind
of envy of his bright, courteous manner, the natural gallantry of the sailor.
If it were but clear that Sylvia took as little thought of him as he did
of her, to all appearance, Philip could even have given him praise for
manly good looks, and a certain kind of geniality of disposition which
made him ready to smile pleasantly at all strangers, from babies upwards.

<P>As the party turned to leave the shop they saw Philip, the guest of
the night before; and they came over to shake hands with him across the
counter; Kinraid's hand was proffered among the number. Last night Philip
could not have believed it possible that such a demonstration of fellowship
should have passed between them; and perhaps there was a slight hesitation
of manner on his part, for some idea or remembrance crossed Kinraid's mind
which brought a keen searching glance into the eyes which for a moment
were fastened on Philip's face. In spite of himself, and during the very
action of hand-shaking, Philip felt a cloud come over his face, not altering
or moving his features, but taking light and peace out of his countenance.

<P>Molly Brunton began to say something, and he gladly turned to look at
her. She was asking him why he went away so early, for they had kept it
up for four hours after he left, and last of all, she added (turning to
Kinraid), her cousin Charley had danced a hornpipe among the platters on
the ground.

<P>Philip hardly knew what he said in reply, the mention of that pas seul
lifted such a weight off his heart. He could smile now, after his grave
fashion, and would have shaken hands again with Kinraid had it been required;
for it seemed to him that no one, caring ever so little in the way that
he did for Sylvia, could have borne four mortal hours of a company where
she had been, and was not; least of all could have danced a hornpipe, either
from gaiety of heart, or even out of complaisance. He felt as if the yearning
after the absent one would have been a weight to his legs, as well as to
his spirit; and he imagined that all men were like himself.
