Far away, over sea and land, over sunny sea again, great guns were booming
on that 7th of May, 1799.

<P>The Mediterranean came up with a long roar on a beach glittering white
with snowy sand, and the fragments of innumerable sea-shells, delicate
and shining as porcelain. Looking at that shore from the sea, a long ridge
of upland ground, beginning from an inland depth, stretched far away into
the ocean on the right, till it ended in a great mountainous bluff, crowned
with the white buildings of a convent sloping rapidly down into the blue
water at its base.

<P>In the clear eastern air, the different characters of the foliage that
clothed the sides of that sea-washed mountain might be discerned from a
long distance by the naked eye; the silver gray of the olive-trees near
its summit; the heavy green and bossy forms of the sycamores lower down;
broken here and there by a solitary terebinth or ilex tree, of a deeper
green and a wider spread, till the eye fell below on the maritime plain,
edged with the white seaboard and the sandy hillocks; with here and there
feathery palm-trees, either isolated or in groups--motionless and distinct
against the hot purple air.

<P>Look again; a little to the left on the sea-shore there are the white
walls of a fortified town, glittering in sunlight, or black in shadow.

<P>The fortifications themselves run out into the sea, forming a port and
a haven against the wild Levantine storms; and a lighthouse rises out of
the waves to guide mariners into safety.

<P>Beyond this walled city, and far away to the left still, there is the
same wide plain shut in by the distant rising ground, till the upland circuit
comes closing in to the north, and the great white rocks meet the deep
tideless ocean with its intensity of blue colour.

<P>Above, the sky is literally purple with heat; and the pitiless light
smites the gazer's weary eye as it comes back from the white shore. Nor
does the plain country in that land offer the refuge and rest of our own
soft green. The limestone rock underlies the vegetation, and gives a glittering,
ashen hue to all the bare patches, and even to the cultivated parts which
are burnt up early in the year. In spring-time alone does the country look
rich and fruitful; then the corn-fields of the plain show their capability
of bearing, 'some fifty, some an hundred fold;' down by the brook Kishon,
flowing not far from the base of the mountainous promontory to the south,
there grow the broad green fig-trees, cool and fresh to look upon; the
orchards are full of glossy-leaved cherry-trees; the tall amaryllis puts
forth crimson and yellow glories in the fields, rivalling the pomp of King
Solomon; the daisies and the hyacinths spread their myriad flowers; the
anemones, scarlet as blood, run hither and thither over the ground like
dazzling flames of fire.

<P>A spicy odour lingers in the heated air; it comes from the multitude
of aromatic flowers that blossom in the early spring. Later on they will
have withered and faded, and the corn will have been gathered, and the
deep green of the eastern foliage will have assumed a kind of gray-bleached
tint.

<P>Even now in May, the hot sparkle of the everlasting sea, the terribly
clear outline of all objects, whether near or distant, the fierce sun right
overhead, the dazzling air around, were inexpressibly wearying to the English
eyes that kept their skilled watch, day and night, on the strongly-fortified
coast-town that lay out a little to the northward of where the British
ships were anchored.

<P>They had kept up a flanking fire for many days in aid of those besieged
in St. Jean d'Acre; and at intervals had listened, impatient, to the sound
of the heavy siege guns, or the sharper rattle of the French musketry.

<P>In the morning, on the 7th of May, a man at the masthead of the <I>Tigre</I>
sang out that he saw ships in the offing; and in reply to the signal that
was hastily run up, he saw the distant vessels hoist friendly flags. That
May morning was a busy time. The besieged Turks took heart of grace; the
French outside, under the command of their great general, made hasty preparations
for a more vigorous assault than all many, both vigorous and bloody, that
had gone before (for the siege was now at its fifty-first day), in hopes
of carrying the town by storm before the reinforcement coming by sea could
arrive; and Sir Sidney Smith, aware of Buonaparte's desperate intention,
ordered all the men, both sailors and marines, that could be spared from
the necessity of keeping up a continual flanking fire from the ships upon
the French, to land, and assist the Turks and the British forces already
there in the defence of the old historic city.

<P>Lieutenant Kinraid, who had shared his captain's daring adventure off
the coast of France three years before, who had been a prisoner with him
and Westley Wright, in the Temple at Paris, and had escaped with them,
and, through Sir Sidney's earnest recommendation, been promoted from being
a warrant officer to the rank of lieutenant, received on this day the honour
from his admiral of being appointed to an especial post of danger. His
heart was like a war-horse, and said, Ha, ha! as the boat bounded over
the waves that were to land him under the ancient machicolated walls where
the Crusaders made their last stand in the Holy Land. Not that Kinraid
knew or cared one jot about those gallant knights of old; all he knew was,
that the French, under Boney, were trying to take the town from the Turks,
and that his admiral said they must not, and so they should not.

<P>He and his men landed on that sandy shore, and entered the town by the
water-port gate; he was singing to himself his own country song--
<DL>
<DD>
Weel may the keel row, the keel row, &amp;C.</DD>

<DD>
and his men, with sailors' aptitude for music, caught up the air, and joined
in the burden with inarticulate sounds.</DD>

<DD>
So, with merry hearts, they threaded the narrow streets of Acre, hemmed
in on either side by the white walls of Turkish houses, with small grated
openings high up, above all chance of peeping intrusion.</DD>

<DD>
Here and there they met an ample-robed and turbaned Turk going along with
as much haste as his stately self-possession would allow. But the majority
of the male inhabitants were gathered together to defend the breach, where
the French guns thundered out far above the heads of the sailors.</DD>

<DD>
They went along none the less merrily for the sound to Djezzar Pacha's
garden, where the old Turk sate on his carpet, beneath the shade of a great
terebinth tree, listening to the interpreter, who made known to him the
meaning of the eager speeches of Sir Sidney Smith and the colonel of the
marines.</DD>

<DD>
As soon as the admiral saw the gallant sailors of H.M.S. <I>Tigre</I>,
he interrupted the council of war without much ceremony, and going to Kinraid,
he despatched them, as before arranged, to the North Ravelin, showing them
the way with rapid, clear directions.</DD>

<DD>
Out of respect to him, they had kept silent while in the strange, desolate
garden; but once more in the streets, the old Newcastle song rose up again
till the men were, perforce, silenced by the haste with which they went
to the post of danger.</DD>

<DD>
It was three o'clock in the afternoon. For many a day these very men had
been swearing at the terrific heat at this hour--even when at sea, fanned
by the soft breeze; but now, in the midst of hot smoke, with former carnage
tainting the air, and with the rush and whizz of death perpetually whistling
in their ears, they were uncomplaining and lighthearted. Many an old joke,
and some new ones, came brave and hearty, on their cheerful voices, even
though the speaker was veiled from sight in great clouds of smoke, cloven
only by the bright flames of death.</DD>

<DD>
A sudden message came; as many of the crew of the <I>Tigre</I> as were
under Lieutenant Kinraid's command were to go down to the Mole, to assist
the new reinforcements (seen by the sailor from the masthead at day-dawn),
under command of Hassan Bey, to land at the Mole, where Sir Sidney then
was.</DD>

<DD>
Off they went, almost as bright and thoughtless as before, though two of
their number lay silent for ever at the North Ravelin--silenced in that
one little half-hour. And one went along with the rest, swearing lustily
at his ill-luck in having his right arm broken, but ready to do good business
with his left.</DD>

<DD>
They helped the Turkish troops to land more with good-will than tenderness;
and then, led by Sir Sidney, they went under the shelter of English guns
to the fatal breach, so often assailed, so gallantly defended, but never
so fiercely contested as on this burning afternoon. The ruins of the massive
wall that here had been broken down by the French, were used by them as
stepping stones to get on a level with the besieged, and so to escape the
heavy stones which the latter hurled down; nay, even the dead bodies of
the morning's comrades were made into ghastly stairs.</DD>

<DD>
When Djezzar Pacha heard that the British sailors were defending the breach,
headed by Sir Sidney Smith, he left his station in the palace garden, gathered
up his robes in haste, and hurried to the breach; where, with his own hands,
and with right hearty good-will, he pulled the sailors down from the post
of danger, saying that if he lost his English friends he lost all!</DD>

<DD>
But little recked the crew of the <I>Tigre</I> of the one old man--Pacha
or otherwise--who tried to hold them back from the fight; they were up
and at the French assailants clambering over the breach in an instant;
and so they went on, as if it were some game at play instead of a deadly
combat, until Kinraid and his men were called off by Sir Sidney, as the
reinforcement of Turkish troops under Hassan Bey were now sufficient for
the defence of that old breach in the walls, which was no longer the principal
object of the French attack; for the besiegers had made a new and more
formidable breach by their incessant fire, knocking down whole streets
of the city walls.</DD>

<DD>
'Fight your best Kinraid!' said Sir Sidney; 'for there's Boney on yonder
hill looking at you.'</DD>

<DD>
And sure enough, on a rising ground, called Richard Coeur de Lion's Mount,
there was a half-circle of French generals, on horseback, all deferentially
attending to the motions, and apparently to the words, of a little man
in their centre; at whose bidding the aide-de-camp galloped swift with
messages to the more distant French camp.</DD>

<DD>
The two ravelins which Kinraid and his men had to occupy, for the purpose
of sending a flanking fire upon the enemy, were not ten yards from that
enemy's van.</DD>

<DD>
But at length there was a sudden rush of the French to that part of the
wall where they imagined they could enter unopposed.</DD>

<DD>
Surprised at this movement, Kinraid ventured out of the shelter of the
ravelin to ascertain the cause; he, safe and untouched during that long
afternoon of carnage, fell now, under a stray musket-shot, and lay helpless
and exposed upon the ground undiscerned by his men, who were recalled to
help in the hot reception which had been planned for the French; who, descending
the city walls into the Pacha's garden, were attacked with sabre and dagger,
and lay headless corpses under the flowering rose-bushes, and by the fountain
side.</DD>

<DD>
Kinraid lay beyond the ravelins, many yards outside the city walls.</DD>

<DD>
He was utterly helpless, for the shot had broken his leg. Dead bodies of
Frenchmen lay strewn around him; no Englishman had ventured out so far.</DD>

<DD>
All the wounded men that he could see were French; and many of these, furious
with pain, gnashed their teeth at him, and cursed him aloud, till he thought
that his best course was to assume the semblance of death; for some among
these men were still capable of dragging themselves up to him, and by concentrating
all their failing energies into one blow, put him to a speedy end.</DD>

<DD>
The outlying pickets of the French army were within easy rifle shot; and
his uniform, although less conspicuous in colour than that of the marines,
by whose sides he had been fighting, would make him a sure mark if he so
much as moved his arm. Yet how he longed to turn, if ever so slightly,
so that the cruel slanting sun might not beat full into his aching eyes.
Fever, too, was coming upon him; the pain in his leg was every moment growing
more severe; the terrible thirst of the wounded, added to the heat and
fatigue of the day, made his lips and tongue feel baked and dry, and his
whole throat seemed parched and wooden. Thoughts of other days, of cool
Greenland seas, where ice abounded, of grassy English homes, began to make
the past more real than the present.</DD>

<DD>
With a great effort he brought his wandering senses back; he knew where
he was now, and could weigh the chances of his life, which were but small;
the unwonted tears came to his eyes as he thought of the newly-made wife
in her English home, who might never know how he died thinking of her.</DD>

<DD>
Suddenly he saw a party of English marines advance, under shelter of the
ravelin, to pick up the wounded, and bear them within the walls for surgical
help. They were so near he could see their faces, could hear them speak;
yet he durst not make any sign to them when he lay within range of the
French picket's fire.</DD>

<DD>
For one moment he could not resist raising his head, to give himself a
chance for life; before the unclean creatures that infest a camp came round
in the darkness of the night to strip and insult the dead bodies, and to
put to death such as had yet the breath of life within them. But the setting
sun came full into his face, and he saw nothing of what he longed to see.</DD>

<DD>
He fell back in despair; he lay there to die.</DD>

<DD>
That strong clear sunbeam had wrought his salvation.</DD>

<DD>
He had been recognized as men are recognized when they stand in the red
glare of a house on fire; the same despair of help, of hopeless farewell
to life, stamped on their faces in blood-red light.</DD>

<DD>
One man left his fellows, and came running forwards, forwards in among
the enemy's wounded, within range of their guns; he bent down over Kinraid;
he seemed to understand without a word; he lifted him up, carrying him
like a child; and with the vehement energy that is more from the force
of will than the strength of body, he bore him back to within the shelter
of the ravelin--not without many shots being aimed at them, one of which
hit Kinraid in the fleshy part of his arm.</DD>

<DD>
Kinraid was racked with agony from his dangling broken leg, and his very
life seemed leaving him; yet he remembered afterwards how the marine recalled
his fellows, and how, in the pause before they returned, his face became
like one formerly known to the sick senses of Kinraid; yet it was too like
a dream, too utterly improbable to be real.</DD>

<DD>
Yet the few words this man said, as he stood breathless and alone by the
fainting Kinraid, fitted in well with the belief conjured up by his personal
appearance. He panted out,--</DD>

<DD>
'I niver thought you'd ha' kept true to her!'</DD>

<DD>
And then the others came up; and while they were making a sling of their
belts, Kinraid fainted utterly away, and the next time that he was fully
conscious, he was lying in his berth in the <I>Tigre</I>, with the ship-surgeon
setting his leg. After that he was too feverish for several days to collect
his senses. When he could first remember, and form a judgment upon his
recollections, he called the man especially charged to attend upon him,
and bade him go and make inquiry in every possible manner for a marine
named Philip Hepburn, and when he was found, to entreat him to come and
see Kinraid.</DD>

<DD>
The sailor was away the greater part of the day, and returned unsuccessful
in his search; he had been from ship to ship, hither and thither; he had
questioned all the marines he had met with, no one knew anything of any
Philip Hepburn.</DD>

<DD>
Kinraid passed a miserably feverish night, and when the doctor exclaimed
the next morning at his retrogression, he told him, with some irritation,
of the ill-success of his servant; he accused the man of stupidity, and
wished fervently that he were able to go himself.</DD>

<DD>
Partly to soothe him, the doctor promised that he would undertake the search
for Hepburn, and he engaged faithfully to follow all Kinraid's eager directions;
not to be satisfied with men's careless words, but to look over muster-rolls
and ships' books.</DD>

<DD>
He, too, brought the same answer, however unwillingly given.</DD>

<DD>
He had set out upon the search so confident 'of success, that he felt doubly
discomfited by failure. However, he had persuaded himself that the lieutenant
had been partially delirious from the effects of his wound, and the power
of the sun shining down just where he lay. There had, indeed, been slight
symptoms of Kinraid's having received a sun-stroke; and the doctor dwelt
largely on these in his endeavour to persuade his patient that it was his
imagination which had endued a stranger with the lineaments of some former
friend.</DD>

<DD>
Kinraid threw his arms out of bed with impatience at all this plausible
talk, which was even more irritating than the fact that Hepburn was still,
undiscovered.</DD>

<DD>
'The man was no friend of mine; I was like to have killed him when last
I saw him. He was a shopkeeper in a country town in England. I had seen
little enough of him; but enough to make me able to swear to him anywhere,
even in a marine's uniform, and in this sweltering country.'</DD>

<DD>
'Faces once seen, especially in excitement, are apt to return upon the
memory in cases of fever,' quoth the doctor, sententiously.</DD>

<DD>
The attendant sailor, reinstalled to some complacency by the failure of
another in the search in which he himself had been unsuccessful, now put
in his explanation.</DD>

<DD>
'Maybe it was a spirit. It's not th' first time as I've heared of a spirit
coming upon earth to save a man's life i' time o' need. My father had an
uncle, a west-country grazier. He was a-coming over Dartmoor in Devonshire
one moonlight night with a power o' money as he'd got for his sheep at
t' fair. It were stowed i' leather bags under th' seat o' th' gig. It were
a rough kind o' road, both as a road in character, for there'd been many
robberies there of late, and th' great rocks stood convenient for hiding-places.
All at once father's uncle feels as if some one were sitting beside him
on th' empty seat; and he turns his head and looks, and there he sees his
brother sitting--his brother as had been dead twelve year and more. So
he turns his head back again, eyes right, and never say a word, but wonders
what it all means. All of a sudden two fellows come out upo' th' white
road from some black shadow, and they looked, and they let th' gig go past,
father's uncle driving hard, I'll warrant him. But for all that he heard
one say to t' other, "By ----, there's <I>two</I> on 'em!" Straight on
he drove faster than ever, till he saw th' far lights of some town or other.
I forget its name, though I've heared it many a time; and then he drew
a long breath, and turned his head to look at his brother, and ask him
how he'd managed to come out of his grave i' Barum churchyard, and th'
seat was as empty as it had been when he set out; and then he knew that
it were a spirit come to help him against th' men who thought to rob him,
and would likely enough ha' murdered him.'</DD>

<DD>
Kinraid had kept quiet through this story. But when the sailor began to
draw the moral, and to say, 'And I think I may make bold to say, sir, as
th' marine who carried you out o' th' Frenchy's gun-shot was just a spirit
come to help you,' he exclaimed impatiently, swearing a great oath as he
did so, 'It was no spirit, I tell you; and I was in my full senses. It
was a man named Philip Hepburn. He said words to me, or over me, as none
but himself would have said. Yet we hated each other like poison; and I
can't make out why he should be there and putting himself in danger to
save me. But so it was; and as you can't find him, let me hear no more
of your nonsense. It was him, and not my fancy, doctor. It was flesh and
blood, and not a spirit, Jack. So get along with you, and leave me quiet.'</DD>

<DD>
All this time Stephen Freeman lay friendless, sick, and shattered, on board
the <I>Thesus</I>.</DD>

<DD>
He had been about his duty close to some shells that were placed on her
deck; a gay young midshipman was thoughtlessly striving to get the fusee
out of one of these by a mallet and spike-nail that lay close at hand;
and a fearful explosion ensued, in which the poor marine, cleaning his
bayonet near, was shockingly burnt and disfigured, the very skin of all
the lower part of his face being utterly destroyed by gunpowder. They said
it was a mercy that his eyes were spared; but he could hardly feel anything
to be a mercy, as he lay tossing in agony, burnt by the explosion, wounded
by splinters, and feeling that he was disabled for life, if life itself
were preserved. Of all that suffered by that fearful accident (and they
were many) none was so forsaken, so hopeless, so desolate, as the Philip
Hepburn about whom such anxious inquiries were being made at that very
time.</DD>
