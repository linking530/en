Philip was too late for the coach he had hoped to go by, but there was
another that left at night, and which reached Newcastle in the forenoon,
so that, by the loss of a night's sleep, he might overtake his lost time.
But, restless and miserable, he could not stop in Hartlepool longer than
to get some hasty food at the inn from which the coach started. He acquainted
himself with the names of the towns through which it would pass, and the
inns at which it would stop, and left word that the coachman was to be
on the look-out for him and pick him up at some one of these places.

<P>He was thoroughly worn out before this happened--too much tired to gain
any sleep in the coach. When he reached Newcastle, he went to engage his
passage in the next London-bound smack, and then directed his steps to
Robinson's, in the Side, to make all the inquiries he could think of respecting
the plough his uncle wanted to know about.

<P>So it was pretty late in the afternoon, indeed almost evening, before
he arrived at the small inn on the quay-side, where he intended to sleep.
It was but a rough kind of place, frequented principally by sailors; he
had been recommended to it by Daniel Robson, who had known it well in former
days. The accommodation in it was, however, clean and homely, and the people
keeping it were respectable enough in their way.

<P>Still Hepburn was rather repelled by the appearance of the sailors who
sate drinking in the bar, and he asked, in a low voice, if there was not
another room. The woman stared in surprise, and only shook her head. Hepburn
went to a separate table, away from the roaring fire, which on this cold
March evening was the great attraction, and called for food and drink.
Then seeing that the other men were eyeing him with the sociable idea of
speaking to him, he asked for pen and ink and paper, with the intention
of defeating their purpose by pre-occupation on his part. But when the
paper came, the new pen, the unused thickened ink, he hesitated long before
he began to write; and at last he slowly put down the words,--

<P>'DEAR AND HONOURED UNCLE,'----

<P>There was a pause; his meal was brought and hastily swallowed. Even
while he was eating it, he kept occasionally touching up the letters of
these words. When he had drunk a glass of ale he began again to write fluently
this time, for he was giving an account of the plough. Then came another
long stop; he was weighing in his own mind what he should say about Kinraid.
Once he thought for a second of writing to Sylvia herself, and telling
her----how much? She might treasure up her lover's words like grains of
gold, while they were lighter than dust in their meaning to Philip's mind;
words which such as the specksioneer used as counters to beguile and lead
astray silly women. It was for him to prove his constancy by action; and
the chances of his giving such proof were infinitesimal in Philip's estimation.
But should the latter mention the bare fact of Kinraid's impressment to
Robson? That would have been the natural course of things, remembering
that the last time Philip had seen either, they were in each other's company.
Twenty times he put his pen to the paper with the intention of relating
briefly the event that had befallen Kinraid; and as often he stopped, as
though the first word would be irrevocable. While he thus sate pen in hand,
thinking himself wiser than conscience, and looking on beyond the next
step which she bade him take into an indefinite future, he caught some
fragments of the sailors' talk at the other end of the room, which made
him listen to their words. They were speaking of that very Kinraid, the
thought of whom filled his own mind like an actual presence. In a rough,
careless way they spoke of the specksioneer, with admiration enough for
his powers as a sailor and harpooner; and from that they passed on to jesting
mention of his power amongst women, and one or two girls' names were spoken
of in connection with him. Hepburn silently added Annie Coulson and Sylvia
Robson to this list, and his cheeks turned paler as he did so. Long after
they had done speaking about Kinraid, after they had paid their shot, and
gone away, he sate in the same attitude, thinking bitter thoughts.

<P>The people of the house prepared for bed. Their silent guest took no
heed of their mute signs. At length the landlord spoke to him, and he started,
gathered his wits together with an effort, and prepared to retire with
the rest. But before he did so, he signed and directed the letter to his
uncle, leaving it still open, however, in case some sudden feeling should
prompt him to add a postscript. The landlord volunteered the information
that the letter his guest had been writing must be posted early the next
morning if it was going south; as the mails in that direction only left
Newcastle every other day.

<P>All night long Hepburn wearied himself with passionate tossings, prompted
by stinging recollection. Towards morning he fell into a dead sound sleep.
He was roused by a hasty knocking at the door. It was broad full daylight;
he had overslept himself, and the smack was leaving by the early tide.
He was even now summoned on board. He dressed, wafered his letter, and
rushed with it to the neighbouring post-office; and, without caring to
touch the breakfast for which he paid, he embarked. Once on board, he experienced
the relief which it always is to an undecided man, and generally is at
first to any one who has been paltering with duty, when circumstances decide
for him. In the first case, it is pleasant to be relieved from the burden
of decision; in the second, the responsibility seems to be shifted on to
impersonal events.

<P>And so Philip sailed out of the mouth of the Tyne on to the great open
sea. It would be a week before the smack reached London, even if she pursued
a tolerably straight course, but she had to keep a sharp look-out after
possible impressment of her crew; and it was not until after many dodges
and some adventures that, at the end of a fortnight from the time of his
leaving Monkshaven, Philip found himself safely housed in London, and ready
to begin the delicate piece of work which was given him to do.

<P>He felt himself fully capable of unravelling each clue to information,
and deciding on the value of the knowledge so gained. But during the leisure
of the voyage he had wisely determined to communicate everything he learnt
about Dickinson, in short, every step he took in the matter, by letter
to his employers. And thus his mind both in and out of his lodgings might
have appeared to have been fully occupied with the concerns of others.

<P>But there were times when the miserable luxury of dwelling upon his
own affairs was his--when he lay down in his bed till he fell into restless
sleep--when the point to which his steps tended in his walks was ascertained.
Then he gave himself up to memory, and regret which often deepened into
despair, and but seldom was cheered by hope.

<P>He grew so impatient of the ignorance in which he was kept--for in those
days of heavy postage any correspondence he might have had on mere Monkshaven
intelligence was very limited as to the affairs at Haytersbank, that he
cut out an advertisement respecting some new kind of plough, from a newspaper
that lay in the chop-house where he usually dined, and rising early the
next morning he employed the time thus gained in going round to the shop
where these new ploughs were sold.

<P>That night he wrote another letter to Daniel Robson, with a long account
of the merits of the implements he had that day seen. With a sick heart
and a hesitating hand, he wound up with a message of regard to his aunt
and to Sylvia; an expression of regard which he dared not make as warm
as he wished, and which, consequently, fell below the usual mark attained
by such messages, and would have appeared to any one who eared to think
about it as cold and formal.

<P>When this letter was despatched, Hepburn began to wonder what he had
hoped for in writing it. He knew that Daniel could write--or rather that
he could make strange hieroglyphics, the meaning of which puzzled others
and often himself; but these pen-and-ink signs were seldom employed by
Robson, and never, so far as Philip knew, for the purpose of letter-writing.
But still he craved so for news of Sylvia--even for a sight of paper which
she had seen, and perhaps touched--that he thought all his trouble about
the plough (to say nothing of the one-and-twopence postage which he had
prepaid in order to make sure of his letter's reception in the frugal household
at Haytersbank) well lost for the mere chance of his uncle's caring enough
for the intelligence to write in reply, or even to get some friend to write
an answer; for in such case, perhaps, Philip might see her name mentioned
in some way, even though it was only that she sent her duty to him.

<P>But the post-office was dumb; no letter came from Daniel Robson. Philip
heard, it is true, from his employers pretty frequently on business; and
he felt sure they would have named it, if any ill had befallen his uncle's
family, for they knew of the relationship and of his intimacy there. They
generally ended their formal letters with as formal a summary of Monkshaven
news; but there was never a mention of the Robsons, and that of itself
was well, but it did not soothe Philip's impatient curiosity. He had never
confided his attachment to his cousin to any one, it was not his way; but
he sometimes thought that if Coulson had not taken his present appointment
to a confidential piece of employment so ill, he would have written to
him and asked him to go up to Haytersbank Farm, and let him know how they
all were.

<P>All this time he was transacting the affair on which he had been sent,
with great skill; and, indeed, in several ways, he was quietly laying the
foundation for enlarging the business in Monkshaven. Naturally grave and
quiet, and slow to speak, he impressed those who saw him with the idea
of greater age and experience than he really possessed. Indeed, those who
encountered him in London, thought he was absorbed in the business of money-making.
Yet before the time came when he could wind up affairs and return to Monkshaven,
he would have given all he possessed for a letter from his uncle, telling
him something about Sylvia. For he still hoped to hear from Robson, although
he knew that he hoped against reason. But we often convince ourselves by
good argument that what we wish for need never have been expected; and
then, at the end of our reasoning, find that we might have saved ourselves
the trouble, for that our wishes are untouched, and are as strong enemies
to our peace of mind as ever. Hepburn's baulked hope was the Mordecai sitting
in Haman's gate; all his success in his errand to London, his well-doing
in worldly affairs, was tasteless, and gave him no pleasure, because of
this blank and void of all intelligence concerning Sylvia.

<P>And yet he came back with a letter from the Fosters in his pocket, curt,
yet expressive of deep gratitude for his discreet services in London; and
at another time--in fact, if Philip's life had been ordered differently
to what it was--it might have given this man a not unworthy pleasure to
remember that, without a penny of his own, simply by diligence, honesty,
and faithful quick-sightedness as to the interests of his masters, he had
risen to hold the promise of being their successor, and to be ranked by
them as a trusted friend.

<P>As the Newcastle smack neared the shore on her voyage home, Hepburn
looked wistfully out for the faint gray outline of Monkshaven Priory against
the sky, and the well-known cliffs; as if the masses of inanimate stone
could tell him any news of Sylvia.

<P>In the streets of Shields, just after landing, he encountered a neighbour
of the Robsons, and an acquaintance of his own. By this honest man, he
was welcomed as a great traveller is welcomed on his return from a long
voyage, with many hearty good shakes of the hand, much repetition of kind
wishes, and offers to treat him to drink. Yet, from some insurmountable
feeling, Philip avoided all mention of the family who were the principal
bond between the honest farmer and himself. He did not know why, but he
could not bear the shock of first hearing her name in the open street,
or in the rough public-house. And thus he shrank from the intelligence
he craved to hear.

<P>Thus he knew no more about the Robsons when he returned to Monkshaven,
than he had done on the day when he had last seen them; and, of course,
his first task there was to give a long <I>viva voce</I> account of all
his London proceedings to the two brothers Foster, who, considering that
they had heard the result of everything by letter, seemed to take an insatiable
interest in details.

<P>He could hardly tell why, but even when released from the Fosters' parlour,
he was unwilling to go to Haytersbank Farm. It was late, it is true, but
on a May evening even country people keep up till eight or nine o'clock.
Perhaps it was because Hepburn was still in his travel-stained dress; having
gone straight to the shop on his arrival in Monkshaven. Perhaps it was
because, if he went this night for the short half-hour intervening before
bed-time, he would have no excuse for paying a longer visit on the following
evening. At any rate, he proceeded straight to Alice Rose's, as soon as
he had finished his interview with his employers.

<P>Both Hester and Coulson had given him their welcome home in the shop,
which they had, however, left an hour or two before him.

<P>Yet they gave him a fresh greeting, almost one in which surprise was
blended, when he came to his lodgings. Even Alice seemed gratified by his
spending this first evening with them, as if she had thought it might have
been otherwise. Weary though he was, he exerted himself to talk and to
relate what he had done and seen in London, as far as he could without
breaking confidence with his employers. It was something to see the pleasure
he gave to his auditors, although there were several mixed feelings in
their minds to produce the expression of it which gratified him. Coulson
was sorry for his former ungenerous reception of the news that Philip was
going to London; Hester and her mother each secretly began to feel as if
this evening was like more happy evenings of old, before the Robsons came
to Haytersbank Farm; and who knows what faint delicious hopes this resemblance
may not have suggested?

<P>While Philip, restless and excited, feeling that he could not sleep,
was glad to pass away the waking hours that must intervene before to-morrow
night, at times, he tried to make them talk of what had happened in Monkshaven
during his absence, but all had gone on in an eventless manner, as far
as he could gather; if they knew of anything affecting the Robsons, they
avoided speaking of it to him; and, indeed, how little likely were they
ever to have heard their names while he was away?
