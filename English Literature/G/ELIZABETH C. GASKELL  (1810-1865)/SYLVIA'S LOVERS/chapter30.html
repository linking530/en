<DD>
And now Philip seemed as prosperous as his heart could desire. The business
flourished, and money beyond his moderate wants came in. As for himself
he required very little; but he had always looked forward to placing his
idol in a befitting shrine; and means for this were now furnished to him.
The dress, the comforts, the position he had desired for Sylvia were all
hers. She did not need to do a stroke of household work if she preferred
to 'sit in her parlour and sew up a seam.' Indeed Phoebe resented any interference
in the domestic labour, which she had performed so long, that she looked
upon the kitchen as a private empire of her own. 'Mrs Hepburn' (as Sylvia
was now termed) had a good dark silk gown-piece in her drawers, as well
as the poor dove-coloured, against the day when she chose to leave off
mourning; and stuff for either gray or scarlet cloaks was hers at her bidding.</DD>

<DD>
What she cared for far more were the comforts with which it was in her
power to surround her mother. In this Philip vied with her; for besides
his old love, and new pity for his aunt Bell, he never forgot how she had
welcomed him to Haytersbank, and favoured his love to Sylvia, in the yearning
days when he little hoped he should ever win his cousin to be his wife.
But even if he had not had these grateful and affectionate feelings towards
the poor woman, he would have done much for her if only to gain the sweet,
rare smiles which his wife never bestowed upon him so freely as when she
saw him attending to 'mother,' for so both of them now called Bell. For
her creature comforts, her silk gowns, and her humble luxury, Sylvia did
not care; Philip was almost annoyed at the indifference she often manifested
to all his efforts to surround her with such things. It was even a hard-ship
to her to leave off her country dress, her uncovered hair, her linsey petticoat,
and loose bed-gown, and to don a stiff and stately gown for her morning
dress. Sitting in the dark parlour at the back of the shop, and doing 'white
work,' was much more wearying to her than running out into the fields to
bring up the cows, or spinning wool, or making up butter. She sometimes
thought to herself that it was a strange kind of life where there were
no out-door animals to look after; the 'ox and the ass' had hitherto come
into all her ideas of humanity; and her care and gentleness had made the
dumb creatures round her father's home into mute friends with loving eyes,
looking at her as if wistful to speak in words the grateful regard that
she could read without the poor expression of language.</DD>

<DD>
She missed the free open air, the great dome of sky above the fields; she
rebelled against the necessity of 'dressing' (as she called it) to go out,
although she acknowledged that it was a necessity where the first step
beyond the threshold must be into a populous street.</DD>

<DD>
It is possible that Philip was right at one time when he had thought to
win her by material advantages; but the old vanities had been burnt out
of her by the hot iron of acute suffering. A great deal of passionate feeling
still existed, concealed and latent; but at this period it appeared as
though she were indifferent to most things, and had lost the power of either
hoping or fearing much. She was stunned into a sort of temporary numbness
on most points; those on which she was sensitive being such as referred
to the injustice and oppression of her father's death, or anything that
concerned her mother.</DD>

<DD>
She was quiet even to passiveness in all her dealings with Philip; he would
have given not a little for some of the old bursts of impatience, the old
pettishness, which, naughty as they were, had gone to form his idea of
the former Sylvia. Once or twice he was almost vexed with her for her docility;
he wanted her so much to have a will of her own, if only that he might
know how to rouse her to pleasure by gratifying it. Indeed he seldom fell
asleep at nights without his last thoughts being devoted to some little
plan for the morrow, that he fancied she would like; and when he wakened
in the early dawn he looked to see if she were indeed sleeping by his side,
or whether it was not all a dream that he called Sylvia 'wife.'</DD>

<DD>
He was aware that her affection for him was not to be spoken of in the
same way as his for her, but he found much happiness in only being allowed
to love and cherish her; and with the patient perseverance that was one
remarkable feature in his character, he went on striving to deepen and
increase her love when most other men would have given up the endeavour,
made themselves content with half a heart, and turned to some other object
of attainment. All this time Philip was troubled by a dream that recurred
whenever he was over-fatigued, or otherwise not in perfect health. Over
and over again in this first year of married life he dreamt this dream;
perhaps as many as eight or nine times, and it never varied. It was always
of Kinraid's return; Kinraid was full of life in Philip's dream, though
in his waking hours he could and did convince himself by all the laws of
probability that his rival was dead. He never remembered the exact sequence
of events in that terrible dream after he had roused himself, with a fight
and a struggle, from his feverish slumbers. He was generally sitting up
in bed when he found himself conscious, his heart beating wildly, with
a conviction of Kinraid's living presence somewhere near him in the darkness.
Occasionally Sylvia was disturbed by his agitation, and would question
him about his dreams, having, like most of her class at that time, great
faith in their prophetic interpretation; but Philip never gave her any
truth in his reply.</DD>

<DD>
After all, and though he did not acknowledge it even to himself, the long-desired
happiness was not so delicious and perfect as he had anticipated. Many
have felt the same in their first year of married life; but the faithful,
patient nature that still works on, striving to gain love, and capable
itself of steady love all the while, is a gift not given to all.</DD>

<DD>
For many weeks after their wedding, Kester never came near them: a chance
word or two from Sylvia showed Philip that she had noticed this and regretted
it; and, accordingly, he made it his business at the next leisure opportunity
to go to Haytersbank (never saying a word to his wife of his purpose),
and seek out Kester.</DD>

<DD>
All the whole place was altered! It was new white-washed, new thatched:
the patches of colour in the surrounding ground were changed with altered
tillage; the great geraniums were gone from the window, and instead, was
a smart knitted blind. Children played before the house door; a dog lying
on the step flew at Philip; all was so strange, that it was even the strangest
thing of all for Kester to appear where everything else was so altered!</DD>

<DD>
Philip had to put up with a good deal of crabbed behaviour on the part
of the latter before he could induce Kester to promise to come down into
the town and see Sylvia in her new home.</DD>

<DD>
Somehow, the visit when paid was but a failure; at least, it seemed so
at the time, though probably it broke the ice of restraint which was forming
over the familiar intercourse between Kester and Sylvia. The old servant
was daunted by seeing Sylvia in a strange place, and stood, sleeking his
hair down, and furtively looking about him, instead of seating himself
on the chair Sylvia had so eagerly brought forward for him.</DD>

<DD>
Then his sense of the estrangement caused by their new positions infected
her, and she began to cry pitifully, saying,--</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, Kester! Kester! tell me about Haytersbank! Is it just as it used to
be in feyther's days?'</DD>

<DD>
'Well, a cannot say as it is,' said Kester, thankful to have a subject
started. 'They'n pleughed up t' oud pasture-field, and are settin' it for
'taters. They're not for much cattle, isn't Higginses. They'll be for corn
in t' next year, a reckon, and they'll just ha' their pains for their payment.
But they're allays so pig-headed, is folk fra' a distance.'</DD>

<DD>
So they went on discoursing on Haytersbank and the old days, till Bell
Robson, having finished her afternoon nap, came slowly downstairs to join
them; and after that the conversation became so broken up, from the desire
of the other two to attend and reply as best they could to her fragmentary
and disjointed talk, that Kester took his leave before long; falling, as
he did so, into the formal and unnaturally respectful manner which he had
adopted on first coming in.</DD>

<DD>
But Sylvia ran after him, and brought him back from the door.</DD>

<DD>
'To think of thy going away, Kester, without either bit or drink; nay,
come back wi' thee, and taste wine and cake.'</DD>

<DD>
Kester stood at the door, half shy, half pleased, while Sylvia, in all
the glow and hurry of a young housekeeper's hospitality, sought for the
decanter of wine, and a wineglass in the corner cupboard, and hastily cut
an immense wedge of cake, which she crammed into his hand in spite of his
remonstrances; and then she poured him out an overflowing glass of wine,
which Kester would far rather have gone without, as he knew manners too
well to suppose that he might taste it without having gone through the
preliminary ceremony of wishing the donor health and happiness. He stood
red and half smiling, with his cake in one hand, his wine in the other,
and then began,--</DD>

<DD>
'Long may ye live,</DD>

<DD>
Happy may ye he,</DD>

<DD>
And blest with a num'rous Pro-ge-ny.'</DD>

<DD>
'Theere, that's po'try for yo' as I larnt i' my youth. But there's a deal
to be said as cannot be put int' po'try, an' yet a cannot say it, somehow.
It 'd tax a parson t' say a' as a've getten i' my mind. It's like a heap
o' woo' just after shearin' time; it's worth a deal, but it tak's a vast
o' combin', an' cardin', an' spinnin' afore it can be made use on. If a
were up to t' use o' words, a could say a mighty deal; but somehow a'm
tongue-teed when a come to want my words most, so a'll only just mak' bold
t' say as a think yo've done pretty well for yo'rsel', getten a house-full
o' furniture' (looking around him as he said this), 'an' vittle an' clothin'
for t' axing, belike, an' a home for t' missus in her time o' need; an'
mebbe not such a bad husband as a once thought yon man 'ud mak'; a'm not
above sayin' as he's, mebbe, better nor a took him for;--so here's to ye
both, and wishin' ye health and happiness, ay, and money to buy yo' another,
as country folk say.'</DD>

<DD>
Having ended his oration, much to his own satisfaction, Kester tossed off
his glass of wine, smacked his lips, wiped his mouth with the back of his
hand, pocketed his cake, and made off.</DD>

<DD>
That night Sylvia spoke of his visit to her husband. Philip never said
how he himself had brought it to pass, nor did he name the fact that he
had heard the old man come in just as he himself had intended going into
the parlour for tea, but had kept away, as he thought Sylvia and Kester
would most enjoy their interview undisturbed. And Sylvia felt as if her
husband's silence was unsympathizing, and shut up the feelings that were
just beginning to expand towards him. She sank again into the listless
state of indifference from which nothing but some reference to former days,
or present consideration for her mother, could rouse her.</DD>

<DD>
Hester was almost surprised at Sylvia's evident liking for her. By slow
degrees Hester was learning to love the woman, whose position as Philip's
wife she would have envied so keenly had she not been so truly good and
pious. But Sylvia seemed as though she had given Hester her whole affection
all at once. Hester could not understand this, while she was touched and
melted by the trust it implied. For one thing Sylvia remembered and regretted--her
harsh treatment of Hester the rainy, stormy night on which the latter had
come to Haytersbank to seek her and her mother, and bring them into Monkshaven
to see the imprisoned father and husband. Sylvia had been struck with Hester's
patient endurance of her rudeness, a rudeness which she was conscious that
she herself should have immediately and vehemently resented. Sylvia did
not understand how a totally different character from hers might immediately
forgive the anger she could not forget; and because Hester had been so
meek at the time, Sylvia, who knew how passing and transitory was her own
anger, thought that all was forgotten; while Hester believed that the words,
which she herself could not have uttered except under deep provocation,
meant much more than they did, and admired and wondered at Sylvia for having
so entirely conquered her anger against her.</DD>

<DD>
Again, the two different women were divergently affected by the extreme
fondness which Bell had shown towards Hester ever since Sylvia's wedding-day.
Sylvia, who had always received more love from others than she knew what
to do with, had the most entire faith in her own supremacy in her mother's
heart, though at times Hester would do certain things more to the poor
old woman's satisfaction. Hester, who had craved for the affection which
had been withheld from her, and had from that one circumstance become distrustful
of her own power of inspiring regard, while she exaggerated the delight
of being beloved, feared lest Sylvia should become jealous of her mother's
open display of great attachment and occasional preference for Hester.
But such a thought never entered Sylvia's mind. She was more thankful than
she knew how to express towards any one who made her mother happy; as has
been already said, the contributing to Bell Robson's pleasures earned Philip
more of his wife's smiles than anything else. And Sylvia threw her whole
heart into the words and caresses she lavished on Hester whenever poor
Mrs Robson spoke of the goodness and kindness of the latter. Hester attributed
more virtue to these sweet words and deeds of gratitude than they deserved;
they did not imply in Sylvia any victory over evil temptation, as they
would have done in Hester.</DD>

<DD>
It seemed to be Sylvia's fate to captivate more people than she cared to
like back again. She turned the heads of John and Jeremiah Foster, who
could hardly congratulate Philip enough on his choice of a wife.</DD>

<DD>
They had been prepared to be critical on one who had interfered with their
favourite project of a marriage between Philip and Hester; and, though
full of compassion for the cruelty of Daniel Robson's fate, they were too
completely men of business not to have some apprehension that the connection
of Philip Hepburn with the daughter of a man who was hanged, might injure
the shop over which both his and their name appeared. But all the possible
proprieties demanded that they should pay attention to the bride of their
former shopman and present successor; and the very first visitors whom
Sylvia had received after her marriage had been John and Jeremiah Foster,
in their Sabbath-day clothes. They found her in the parlour (so familiar
to both of them!) clear-starching her mother's caps, which had to be got
up in some particular fashion that Sylvia was afraid of dictating to Phoebe.</DD>

<DD>
She was a little disturbed at her visitors discovering her at this employment;
but she was on her own ground, and that gave her self-possession; and she
welcomed the two old men so sweetly and modestly, and looked so pretty
and feminine, and, besides, so notable in her handiwork, that she conquered
all their prejudices at one blow; and their first thought on leaving the
shop was how to do her honour, by inviting her to a supper party at Jeremiah
Foster's house.</DD>

<DD>
Sylvia was dismayed when she was bidden to this wedding feast, and Philip
had to use all his authority, though tenderly, to make her consent to go
at all. She had been to merry country parties like the Corneys', and to
bright hay-making romps in the open air; but never to a set stately party
at a friend's house.</DD>

<DD>
She would fain have made attendance on her mother an excuse; but Philip
knew he must not listen to any such plea, and applied to Hester in the
dilemma, asking her to remain with Mrs Robson while he and Sylvia went
out visiting; and Hester had willingly, nay, eagerly consented--it was
much more to her taste than going out.</DD>

<DD>
So Philip and Sylvia set out, arm-in-arm, down Bridge Street, across the
bridge, and then clambered up the hill. On the way he gave her the directions
she asked for about her behaviour as bride and most honoured guest; and
altogether succeeded, against his intention and will, in frightening her
so completely as to the grandeur and importance of the occasion, and the
necessity of remembering certain set rules, and making certain set speeches
and attending to them when the right time came, that, if any one so naturally
graceful could have been awkward, Sylvia would have been so that night.</DD>

<DD>
As it was, she sate, pale and weary-looking, on the very edge of her chair;
she uttered the formal words which Philip had told her were appropriate
to the occasion, and she heartily wished herself safe at home and in bed.
Yet she left but one unanimous impression on the company when she went
away, namely, that she was the prettiest and best-behaved woman they had
ever seen, and that Philip Hepburn had done well in choosing her, felon's
daughter though she might be.</DD>

<DD>
Both the hosts had followed her into the lobby to help Philip in cloaking
her, and putting on her pattens. They were full of old-fashioned compliments
and good-wishes one speech of theirs came up to her memory in future years:--</DD>

<DD>
'Now, Sylvia Hepburn,' said Jeremiah, 'I've known thy husband long, and
I don't say but what thou hast done well in choosing him; but if he ever
neglects or ill-uses thee, come to me, and I'll give him a sound lecture
on his conduct. Mind, I'm thy friend from this day forrards, and ready
to take thy part against him!'</DD>

<DD>
Philip smiled as if the day would never come when he should neglect or
ill-use his darling; Sylvia smiled a little, without much attending to,
or caring for, the words that were detaining her, tired as she was; John
and Jeremiah chuckled over the joke; but the words came up again in after
days, as words idly spoken sometimes do.</DD>

<DD>
Before the end of that first year, Philip had learnt to be jealous of his
wife's new love for Hester. To the latter, Sylvia gave the free confidence
on many things which Philip fancied she withheld from him. A suspicion
crossed his mind, from time to time, that Sylvia might speak of her former
lover to Hester. It would be not unnatural, he thought, if she did so,
believing him to be dead; but the idea irritated him.</DD>

<DD>
He was entirely mistaken, however; Sylvia, with all her apparent frankness,
kept her deep sorrows to herself. She never mentioned her father's name,
though he was continually present to her mind. Nor did she speak of Kinraid
to human being, though, for his sake, her voice softened when, by chance,
she spoke to a passing sailor; and for his sake her eyes lingered on such
men longer than on others, trying to discover in them something of the
old familiar gait; and partly for his dead sake, and partly because of
the freedom of the outlook and the freshness of the air, she was glad occasionally
to escape from the comfortable imprisonment of her 'parlour,' and the close
streets around the marketplace, and to mount the cliffs and sit on the
turf, gazing abroad over the wide still expanse of the open sea; for, at
that height, even breaking waves only looked like broken lines of white
foam on the blue watery plain.</DD>

<DD>
She did not want any companion on these rambles, which had somewhat of
the delight of stolen pleasures; for all the other respectable matrons
and town-dwellers whom she knew were content to have always a business
object for their walk, or else to stop at home in their own households;
and Sylvia was rather ashamed of her own yearnings for solitude and open
air, and the sight and sound of the mother-like sea. She used to take off
her hat, and sit there, her hands clasping her knees, the salt air lifting
her bright curls, gazing at the distant horizon over the sea, in a sad
dreaminess of thought; if she had been asked on what she meditated, she
could not have told you.</DD>

<DD>
But, by-and-by, the time came when she was a prisoner in the house; a prisoner
in her room, lying in bed with a little baby by her side--her child, Philip's
child. His pride, his delight knew no bounds; this was a new fast tie between
them; this would reconcile her to the kind of life that, with all its respectability
and comfort, was so different from what she had lived before, and which
Philip had often perceived that she felt to be dull and restraining. He
already began to trace in the little girl, only a few days old, the lovely
curves that he knew so well by heart in the mother's face. Sylvia, too,
pale, still, and weak, was very happy; yes, really happy for the first
time since her irrevocable marriage. For its irrevocableness had weighed
much upon her with a sense of dull hopelessness; she felt all Philip's
kindness, she was grateful to him for his tender regard towards her mother,
she was learning to love him as well as to like and respect him. She did
not know what else she could have done but marry so true a friend, and
she and her mother so friendless; but, at the same time, it was like lead
on her morning spirits when she awoke and remembered that the decision
was made, the dead was done, the choice taken which comes to most people
but once in their lives. Now the little baby came in upon this state of
mind like a ray of sunlight into a gloomy room.</DD>

<DD>
Even her mother was rejoiced and proud; even with her crazed brain and
broken heart, the sight of sweet, peaceful infancy brought light to her.
All the old ways of holding a baby, of hushing it to sleep, of tenderly
guarding its little limbs from injury, came back, like the habits of her
youth, to Bell; and she was never so happy or so easy in her mind, or so
sensible and connected in her ideas, as when she had Sylvia's baby in her
arms.</DD>

<DD>
It was a pretty sight to see, however familiar to all of us such things
may be--the pale, worn old woman, in her quaint, old-fashioned country
dress, holding the little infant on her knees, looking at its open, unspeculative
eyes, and talking the little language to it as though it could understand;
the father on his knees, kept prisoner by a small, small finger curled
round his strong and sinewy one, and gazing at the tiny creature with wondering
idolatry; the young mother, fair, pale, and smiling, propped up on pillows
in order that she, too, might see the wonderful babe; it was astonishing
how the doctor could come and go without being drawn into the admiring
vortex, and look at this baby just as if babies came into the world every
day.</DD>

<DD>
'Philip,' said Sylvia, one night, as he sate as still as a mouse in her
room, imagining her to be asleep. He was by her bedside in a moment.</DD>

<DD>
'I've been thinking what she's to be called. Isabella, after mother; and
what were yo'r mother's name?'</DD>

<DD>
'Margaret,' said he.</DD>

<DD>
'Margaret Isabella; Isabella Margaret. Mother's called Bell. She might
be called Bella.'</DD>

<DD>
'I could ha' wished her to be called after thee.'</DD>

<DD>
She made a little impatient movement.</DD>

<DD>
'Nay; Sylvia's not a lucky name. Best be called after thy mother and mine.
And I want for to ask Hester to be godmother.'</DD>

<DD>
'Anything thou likes, sweetheart. Shall we call her Rose, after Hester
Rose?'</DD>

<DD>
'No, no!' said Sylvia; 'she mun be called after my mother, or thine, or
both. I should like her to be called Bella, after mother, because she's
so fond of baby.'</DD>

<DD>
'Anything to please thee, darling.'</DD>

<DD>
'Don't say that as if it didn't signify; there's a deal in having a pretty
name,' said Sylvia, a little annoyed. 'I ha' allays hated being called
Sylvia. It were after father's mother, Sylvia Steele.'</DD>

<DD>
'I niver thought any name in a' the world so sweet and pretty as Sylvia,'
said Philip, fondly; but she was too much absorbed in her own thoughts
to notice either his manner or his words.</DD>

<DD>
'There, yo'll not mind if it is Bella, because yo' see my mother is alive
to be pleased by its being named after her, and Hester may be godmother,
and I'll ha' t' dove-coloured silk as yo' gave me afore we were married
made up into a cloak for it to go to church in.'</DD>

<DD>
'I got it for thee,' said Philip, a little disappointed. 'It'll be too
good for the baby.'</DD>

<DD>
'Eh! but I'm so careless, I should be spilling something on it? But if
thou got it for me I cannot find i' my heart for t' wear it on baby, and
I'll have it made into a christening gown for mysel'. But I'll niver feel
at my ease in it, for fear of spoiling it.</DD>

<DD>
'Well! an' if thou does spoil it, love, I'll get thee another. I make account
of riches only for thee; that I may be able to get thee whativer thou's
a fancy for, for either thysel', or thy mother.'</DD>

<DD>
She lifted her pale face from her pillow, and put up her lips to kiss him
for these words.</DD>

<DD>
Perhaps on that day Philip reached the zenith of his life's happiness.</DD>
