But before Coulson was married, many small events happened--small events
to all but Philip. To him they were as the sun and moon. The days when
he went up to Haytersbank and Sylvia spoke to him, the days when he went
up and she had apparently no heart to speak to any one, but left the room
as soon as he came, or never entered it at all, although she must have
known that he was there--these were his alternations from happiness to
sorrow.

<P>From her parents he always had a welcome. Oppressed by their daughter's
depression of spirits, they hailed the coming of any visitor as a change
for her as well as for themselves. The former intimacy with the Corneys
was in abeyance for all parties, owing to Bessy Corney's out-spoken grief
for the loss of her cousin, as if she had had reason to look upon him as
her lover, whereas Sylvia's parents felt this as a slur upon their daughter's
cause of grief. But although at this time the members of the two families
ceased to seek after each other's society, nothing was said. The thread
of friendship might be joined afresh at any time, only just now it was
broken; and Philip was glad of it. Before going to Haytersbank he sought
each time for some little present with which to make his coming welcome.
And now he wished even more than ever that Sylvia had cared for learning;
if she had he could have taken her many a pretty ballad, or story-book,
such as were then in vogue. He did try her with the translation of the
<I>Sorrows of Werther</I>, so popular at the time that it had a place in
all pedlars' baskets, with Law's <I>Serious Call</I>, the <I>Pilgrim's
Progress</I>, Klopstock's <I>Messiah</I> and <I>Paradise Lost</I>. But
she could not read it for herself; and after turning the leaves languidly
over, and smiling a little at the picture of Charlotte cutting bread and
butter in a left-handed manner, she put it aside on the shelf by the <I>Complete
Farrier</I>; and there Philip saw it, upside down and untouched, the next
time he came to the farm.

<P>Many a time during that summer did he turn to the few verses in Genesis
in which Jacob's twice seven years service for Rachel is related, and try
and take fresh heart from the reward which came to the patriarch's constancy
at last. After trying books, nosegays, small presents of pretty articles
of dress, such as suited the notions of those days, and finding them all
received with the same languid gratitude, he set himself to endeavour to
please her in some other way. It was time that he should change his tactics;
for the girl was becoming weary of the necessity for thanking him, every
time he came, for some little favour or other. She wished he would let
her alone and not watch her continually with such sad eyes. Her father
and mother hailed her first signs of impatient petulance towards him as
a return to the old state of things before Kinraid had come to disturb
the tenour of their lives; for even Daniel had turned against the specksioneer,
irritated by the Corneys' loud moans over the loss of the man to whom their
daughter said that she was attached. If Daniel wished for him to be alive
again, it was mainly that the Corneys might be convinced that his last
visit to the neighbourhood of Monkshaven was for the sake of the pale and
silent Sylvia, and not for that of Bessy, who complained of Kinraid's untimely
death rather as if by it she had been cheated of a husband than for any
overwhelming personal love towards the deceased.

<P>'If he were after her he were a big black scoundrel, that's what he
were; and a wish he were alive again to be hung. But a dunnot believe it;
them Corney lasses were allays a-talkin' an' a-thinking on sweethearts,
and niver a man crossed t' threshold but they tried him on as a husband.
An' their mother were no better Kinraid has spoken civil to Bessy as became
a lad to a lass, and she makes an ado over him as if they'd been to church
together not a week sin'.'

<P>'I dunnot uphold t' Corneys; but Molly Corney--as is Molly Brunton now--used
to speak on this dead man to our Sylvie as if he were her sweetheart in
old days. Now there's no smoke without fire, and I'm thinking it's likely
enough he were one of them fellows as is always after some lass or another,
and, as often as not, two or three at a time. Now look at Philip, what
a different one he is! He's niver thought on a woman but our Sylvie, I'll
be bound. I wish he wern't so old-fashioned and faint-hearted.'

<P>'Ay! and t' shop's doin' a vast o' business, I've heard say. He's a
deal better company, too, nor he used to be. He'd a way o' preaching wi'
him as a couldn't abide; but now he tak's his glass, an' holds his tongue,
leavin' room for wiser men to say their say.'

<P>Such was a conjugal colloquy about this time. Philip was gaining ground
with Daniel, and that was something towards winning Sylvia's heart; for
she was unaware of her father's change of feeling towards Kinraid, and
took all his tenderness towards herself as if they were marks of his regard
for her lost lover and his sympathy in her loss, instead of which he was
rather feeling as if it might be a good thing after all that the fickle-hearted
sailor was dead and drowned. In fact, Daniel was very like a child in all
the parts of his character. He was strongly affected by whatever was present,
and apt to forget the absent. He acted on impulse, and too often had reason
to be sorry for it; but he hated his sorrow too much to let it teach him
wisdom for the future. With all his many faults, however, he had something
in him which made him be dearly loved, both by the daughter whom he indulged,
and the wife who was in fact superior to him, but whom he imagined that
he ruled with a wise and absolute sway.

<P>Love to Sylvia gave Philip tact. He seemed to find out that to please
the women of the household he must pay all possible attention to the man;
and though he cared little in comparison for Daniel, yet this autumn he
was continually thinking of how he could please him. When he had said or
done anything to gratify or amuse her father, Sylvia smiled and was kind.
Whatever he did was right with his aunt; but even she was unusually glad
when her husband was pleased. Still his progress was slow towards his object;
and often he sighed himself to sleep with the words, 'seven years, and
maybe seven years more.' Then in his dreams he saw Kinraid again, sometimes
struggling, sometimes sailing towards land, the only one on board a swift
advancing ship, alone on deck, stern and avenging; till Philip awoke in
remorseful terror.

<P>Such and similar dreams returned with the greater frequency when, in
the November of that year, the coast between Hartlepool and Monkshaven
was overshadowed by the presence of guard-ships, driven south from their
station at North Shields by the resolution which the sailors of that port
had entered into to resist the press-gang, and the energy with which they
had begun to carry out their determination. For on a certain Tuesday evening
yet remembered by old inhabitants of North Shields, the sailors in the
merchant service met together and overpowered the press-gang, dismissing
them from the town with the highest contempt, and with their jackets reversed.
A numerous mob went with them to Chirton Bar; gave them three cheers at
parting, but vowed to tear them limb from limb should they seek to re-enter
North Shields. But a few days afterwards some fresh cause of irritation
arose, and five hundred sailors, armed with such swords and pistols as
they could collect, paraded through the town in the most riotous manner,
and at last attempted to seize the tender Eleanor, on some pretext of the
ill-treatment of the impressed men aboard. This endeavour failed, however,
owing to the energetic conduct of the officers in command. Next day this
body of sailors set off for Newcastle; but learning, before they reached
the town, that there was a strong military and civil force prepared to
receive them there, they dispersed for the time; but not before the good
citizens had received a great fright, the drums of the North York-shire
militia beating to arms, and the terrified people rushing out into the
streets to learn the reason of the alarm, and some of them seeing the militia,
under the command of the Earl of Fauconberg, marching from the guard-house
adjoining New Gate to the house of rendezvous for impressed seamen in the
Broad Chase.

<P>But a few weeks after, the impressment service took their revenge for
the insults they had been subjected to in North Shields. In the dead of
night a cordon was formed round that town by a regiment stationed at Tynemouth
barracks; the press-gangs belonging to armed vessels lying off Shields
harbour were let loose; no one within the circle could escape, and upwards
of two hundred and fifty men, sailors, mechanics, labourers of every description,
were forced on board the armed ships. With that prize they set sail, and
wisely left the place, where deep passionate vengeance was sworn against
them. Not all the dread of an invasion by the French could reconcile the
people of these coasts to the necessity of impressment. Fear and confusion
prevailed after this to within many miles of the sea-shore. A Yorkshire
gentleman of rank said that his labourers dispersed like a covey of birds,
because a press-gang was reported to have established itself so far inland
as Tadcaster; and they only returned to work on the assurance from the
steward of his master's protection, but even then begged leave to sleep
on straw in the stables or outhouses belonging to their landlord, not daring
to sleep at their own homes. No fish was caught, for the fishermen dared
not venture out to sea; the markets were deserted, as the press-gangs might
come down on any gathering of men; prices were raised, and many were impoverished;
many others ruined. For in the great struggle in which England was then
involved, the navy was esteemed her safeguard; and men must be had at any
price of money, or suffering, or of injustice. Landsmen were kidnapped
and taken to London; there, in too many instances, to be discharged without
redress and penniless, because they were discovered to be useless for the
purpose for which they had been taken.

<P>Autumn brought back the whaling-ships. But the period of their return
was full of gloomy anxiety, instead of its being the annual time of rejoicing
and feasting; of gladdened households, where brave steady husbands or sons
returned; of unlimited and reckless expenditure, and boisterous joviality
among those who thought that they had earned unbounded licence on shore
by their six months of compelled abstinence. In other years this had been
the time for new and handsome winter clothing; for cheerful if humble hospitality;
for the shopkeepers to display their gayest and best; for the public-houses
to be crowded; for the streets to be full of blue jackets, rolling along
with merry words and open hearts. In other years the boiling-houses had
been full of active workers, the staithes crowded with barrels, the ship-carpenters'
yards thronged with seamen and captains; now a few men, tempted by high
wages, went stealthily by back lanes to their work, clustering together,
with sinister looks, glancing round corners, and fearful of every approaching
footstep, as if they were going on some unlawful business, instead of true
honest work. Most of them kept their whaling-knives about them ready for
bloody defence if they were attacked. The shops were almost deserted; there
was no unnecessary expenditure by the men; they dared not venture out to
buy lavish presents for the wife or sweetheart or little children. The
public-houses kept scouts on the look-out; while fierce men drank and swore
deep oaths of vengeance in the bar-men who did not maunder in their cups,
nor grow foolishly merry, but in whom liquor called forth all the desperate,
bad passions of human nature.

<P>Indeed, all along the coast of Yorkshire, it seemed as if a blight hung
over the land and the people. Men dodged about their daily business with
hatred and suspicion in their eyes, and many a curse went over the sea
to the three fatal ships lying motionless at anchor three miles off Monkshaven.
When first Philip had heard in his shop that these three-men-of-war might
be seen lying fell and still on the gray horizon, his heart sank, and he
scarcely dared to ask their names. For if one should be the <I>Alcestis</I>;
if Kinraid should send word to Sylvia; if he should say he was living,
and loving, and faithful; if it should come to pass that the fact of the
undelivered message sent by her lover through Philip should reach Sylvia's
ears what would be the position of the latter, not merely in her love--that,
of course, would be hopeless--but in her esteem? All sophistry vanished;
the fear of detection awakened Philip to a sense of guilt; and, besides,
he found out, that, in spite of all idle talk and careless slander, he
could not help believing that Kinraid was in terrible earnest when he uttered
those passionate words, and entreated that they might be borne to Sylvia.
Some instinct told Philip that if the specksioneer had only flirted with
too many, yet that for Sylvia Robson his love was true and vehement. Then
Philip tried to convince himself that, from all that was said of his previous
character, Kinraid was not capable of an enduring constant attachment;
and with such poor opiate to his conscience as he could obtain from this
notion Philip was obliged to remain content, until, a day or two after
the first intelligence of the presence of those three ships, he learned,
with some trouble and pains, that their names were the <I>Megoera</I>,
the <I>Bellerophon</I>, and the <I>Hanover</I>.

<P>Then he began to perceive how unlikely it was that the <I>Alcestis</I>
should have been lingering on this shore all these many months. She was,
doubtless, gone far away by this time; she had, probably, joined the fleet
on the war station. Who could tell what had become of her and her crew?
she might have been in battle before now, and if so----

<P>So his previous fancies shrank to nothing, rebuked for their improbability,
and with them vanished his self-reproach. Yet there were times when the
popular attention seemed totally absorbed by the dread of the press-gang;
when no other subject was talked about--hardly, in fact, thought about.
At such flows of panic, Philip had his own private fears lest a flash of
light should come upon Sylvia, and she should suddenly see that Kinraid's
absence might be accounted for in another way besides death. But when he
reasoned, this seemed unlikely. No man-of-war had been seen off the coast,
or, if seen, had never been spoken about, at the time of Kinraid's disappearance.
If he had vanished this winter time, every one would have been convinced
that the press-gang had seized upon him. Philip had never heard any one
breathe the dreaded name of the <I>Alcestis</I>. Besides, he went on to
think, at the farm they are out of hearing of this one great weary subject
of talk. But it was not so, as he became convinced one evening. His aunt
caught him a little aside while Sylvia was in the diary, and her husband
talking in the shippen with Kester.

<P>'For good's sake, Philip, dunnot thee bring us talk about t' press-gang.
It's a thing as has got hold on my measter, till thou'd think him possessed.
He's speaking perpetual on it i' such a way, that thou'd think he were
itching to kill 'em a' afore he tasted bread again. He really trembles
wi' rage and passion; an' a' night it's just as bad. He starts up i' his
sleep, swearing and cursing at 'em, till I'm sometimes afeared he'll mak'
an end o' me by mistake. And what mun he do last night but open out on
Charley Kinraid, and tell Sylvie he thought m'appen t' gang had got hold
on him. It might make her cry a' her saut tears o'er again.'

<P>Philip spoke, by no wish of his own, but as if compelled to speak.

<P>'An' who knows but what it's true?'

<P>The instant these words had come out of his lips he could have bitten
his tongue off. And yet afterwards it was a sort of balm to his conscience
that he had so spoken.

<P>'What nonsense, Philip!' said his aunt; 'why, these fearsome ships were
far out o' sight when he went away, good go wi' him, and Sylvie just getting
o'er her trouble so nicely, and even my master went on for to say if they'd
getten hold on him, he were not a chap to stay wi' 'em; he'd gi'en proofs
on his hatred to 'em, time on. He either ha' made off--an' then sure enough
we should ha' heerd on him somehow--them Corneys is full on him still and
they've a deal to wi' his folk beyond Newcassel--or, as my master says,
he were just t' chap to hang or drown hissel, sooner nor do aught against
his will.'

<P>'What did Sylvie say?' asked Philip, in a hoarse low voice.

<P>'Say? why, a' she could say was to burst out crying, and after a bit,
she just repeated her feyther's words, and said anyhow he was dead, for
he'd niver live to go to sea wi' a press-gang. She knowed him too well
for that. Thou sees she thinks a deal on him for a spirited chap, as can
do what he will. I belie' me she first began to think on him time o' t'
fight aboard th' <I>Good Fortune</I>, when Darley were killed, and he would
seem tame-like to her if he couldn't conquer press-gangs, and men-o'-war.
She's sooner think on him drowned, as she's ne'er to see him again.'

<P>'It's best so,' said Philip, and then, to calm his unusually excited
aunt, he promised to avoid the subject of the press-gang as much as possible.

<P>But it was a promise very difficult of performance, for Daniel Robson
was, as his wife said, like one possessed. He could hardly think of anything
else, though he himself was occasionally weary of the same constantly recurring
idea, and would fain have banished it from his mind. He was too old a man
to be likely to be taken by them; he had no son to become their victim;
but the terror of them, which he had braved and defied in his youth, seemed
to come back and take possession of him in his age; and with the terror
came impatient hatred. Since his wife's illness the previous winter he
had been a more sober man until now. He was never exactly drunk, for he
had a strong, well-seasoned head; but the craving to hear the last news
of the actions of the press-gang drew him into Monkshaven nearly every
day at this dead agricultural season of the year; and a public-house is
generally the focus from which gossip radiates; and probably the amount
of drink thus consumed weakened Robson's power over his mind, and caused
the concentration of thought on one subject. This may be a physiological
explanation of what afterwards was spoken of as a supernatural kind of
possession, leading him to his doom.
