<DD>
A few days after, farmer Robson left Haytersbank betimes on a longish day's
journey, to purchase a horse. Sylvia and her mother were busied with a
hundred household things, and the early winter's evening closed in upon
them almost before they were aware. The consequences of darkness in the
country even now are to gather the members of a family together into one
room, and to make them settle to some sedentary employment; and it was
much more the case at the period of my story, when candles were far dearer
than they are at present, and when one was often made to suffice for a
large family.</DD>

<DD>
The mother and daughter hardly spoke at all when they sat down at last.
The cheerful click of the knitting-needles made a pleasant home-sound;
and in the occasional snatches of slumber that overcame her mother, Sylvia
could hear the long-rushing boom of the waves, down below the rocks, for
the Haytersbank gulley allowed the sullen roar to come up so far inland.
It might have been about eight o'clock--though from the monotonous course
of the evening it seemed much later--when Sylvia heard her father's heavy
step cranching down the pebbly path. More unusual, she heard his voice
talking to some companion.</DD>

<DD>
Curious to see who it could be, with a lively instinctive advance towards
any event which might break the monotony she had begun to find somewhat
dull, she sprang up to open the door. Half a glance into the gray darkness
outside made her suddenly timid, and she drew back behind the door as she
opened it wide to admit her father and Kinraid.</DD>

<DD>
Daniel Robson came in bright and boisterous. He was pleased with his purchase,
and had had some drink to celebrate his bargain. He had ridden the new
mare into Monkshaven, and left her at the smithy there until morning, to
have her feet looked at, and to be new shod. On his way from the town he
had met Kinraid wandering about in search of Haytersbank Farm itself, so
he had just brought him along with him; and here they were, ready for bread
and cheese, and aught else the mistress would set before them.</DD>

<DD>
To Sylvia the sudden change into brightness and bustle occasioned by the
entrance of her father and the specksioneer was like that which you may
effect any winter's night, when you come into a room where a great lump
of coal lies hot and slumbering on the fire; just break it up with a judicious
blow from the poker, and the room, late so dark, and dusk, and lone, is
full of life, and light, and warmth.</DD>

<DD>
She moved about with pretty household briskness, attending to all her father's
wants. Kinraid's eye watched her as she went backwards and forwards, to
and fro, into the pantry, the back-kitchen, out of light into shade, out
of the shadow into the broad firelight where he could see and note her
appearance. She wore the high-crowned linen cap of that day, surmounting
her lovely masses of golden brown hair, rather than concealing them, and
tied firm to her head by a broad blue ribbon. A long curl hung down on
each side of her neck her throat rather, for her neck was concealed by
a little spotted handkerchief carefully pinned across at the waist of her
brown stuff gown.</DD>

<DD>
How well it was, thought the young girl, that she had doffed her bed-gown
and linsey-woolsey petticoat, her working-dress, and made herself smart
in her stuff gown, when she sate down to work with her mother.</DD>

<DD>
By the time she could sit down again, her father and Kinraid had their
glasses filled, and were talking of the relative merits of various kinds
of spirits; that led on to tales of smuggling, and the different contrivances
by which they or their friends had eluded the preventive service; the nightly
relays of men to carry the goods inland; the kegs of brandy found by certain
farmers whose horses had gone so far in the night, that they could do no
work the next day; the clever way in which certain women managed to bring
in prohibited goods; in fact, that when a woman did give her mind to smuggling,
she was more full of resources, and tricks, and impudence, and energy than
any man. There was no question of the morality of the affair; one of the
greatest signs of the real progress we have made since those times seems
to be that our daily concerns of buying and selling, eating and drinking,
whatsoever we do, are more tested by the real practical standard of our
religion than they were in the days of our grandfathers. Neither Sylvia
nor her mother was in advance of their age. Both listened with admiration
to the ingenious devices, and acted as well as spoken lies, that were talked
about as fine and spirited things. Yet if Sylvia had attempted one tithe
of this deceit in her every-day life, it would have half broken her mother's
heart. But when the duty on .salt was strictly and cruelly enforced, making
it penal to pick up rough dirty lumps containing small quantities that
might be thrown out with the ashes of the brine-houses on the high-roads;
when the price of this necessary was so increased by the tax upon it as
to make it an expensive, sometimes an unattainable, luxury to the working
man, Government did more to demoralise the popular sense of rectitude and
uprightness than heaps of sermons could undo. And the same, though in smaller
measure, was the consequence of many other taxes. It may seem curious to
trace up the popular standard of truth to taxation; but I do not think
the idea would be so very farfetched.</DD>

<DD>
From smuggling adventures it was easy to pass on to stories of what had
happened to Robson, in his youth a sailor in the Greenland seas, and to
Kinraid, now one of the best harpooners in any whaler that sailed off the
coast.</DD>

<DD>
'There's three things to be afeared on,' said Robson, authoritatively:
'there's t' ice, that's bad; there's dirty weather, that's worse; and there's
whales theirselves, as is t' worst of all; leastways, they was i' my days;
t' darned brutes may ha' larnt better manners sin'. When I were young,
they could niver be got to let theirsels be harpooned wi'out flounderin'
and makin' play wi' their tales and their fins, till t' say were all in
a foam, and t' boats' crews was all o'er wi' spray, which i' them latitudes
is a kind o' shower-bath not needed.'</DD>

<DD>
'Th' whales hasn't mended their manners, as you call it,' said Kinraid;
'but th' ice is not to be spoken lightly on. I were once in th' ship <I>John</I>,
of Hull, and we were in good green water, and were keen after whales; and
ne'er thought harm of a great gray iceberg as were on our lee-bow, a mile
or so off; it looked as if it had been there from the days of Adam, and
were likely to see th' last man out, and it ne'er a bit bigger nor smaller
in all them thousands and thousands o' years. Well, the fast-boats were
out after a fish, and I were specksioneer in one; and we were so keen after
capturing our whale, that none on us ever saw that we were drifting away
from them right into deep shadow o' th' iceberg. But we were set upon our
whale, and I harpooned it; and as soon as it were dead we lashed its fins
together, and fastened its tail to our boat; and then we took breath and
looked about us, and away from us a little space were th' other boats,
wi' two other fish making play, and as likely as not to break loose, for
I may say as I were th' best harpooner on board the <I>John</I>, wi'out
saying great things o' mysel'. So I says, "My lads, one o' you stay i'
th' boat by this fish,"--the fins o' which, as I said, I'd reeved a rope
through mysel', and which was as dead as Noah's grandfather--"and th' rest
on us shall go off and help th' other boats wi' their fish." For, you see,
we had another boat close by in order to sweep th' fish. (I suppose they
swept fish i' your time, master?)'</DD>

<DD>
'Ay, ay!' said Robson; 'one boat lies still holding t' end o' t' line;
t' other makes a circuit round t' fish.'</DD>

<DD>
'Well! luckily for us we had our second boat, for we all got into it, ne'er
a man on us was left i' th' fast-boat. And says I, "But who's to stay by
t' dead fish?" And no man answered, for they were all as keen as me for
to go and help our mates; and we thought as we could come back to our dead
fish, as had a boat for a buoy, once we had helped our mates. So off we
rowed, every man Jack on us, out o' the black shadow o' th' iceberg, as
looked as steady as th' pole-star. Well we had na' been a dozen fathoms
away fra' th' boat as we had left, when crash down wi' a roaring noise,
and then a gulp of the deep waters, and then a shower o' blinding spray;
and when we had wiped our eyes clear, and getten our hearts down agen fra'
our mouths, there were never a boat nor a glittering belly o' e'er a great
whale to be seen; but th' iceberg were there, still and grim, as if a hundred
ton or more had fallen off all in a mass, and crushed down boat, and fish,
and all, into th' deep water, as goes half through the earth in them latitudes.
Th' coal-miners round about Newcastle way may come upon our good boat if
they mine deep enough, else ne'er another man will see her. And I left
as good a clasp-knife in her as ever I clapt eyes on.'</DD>

<DD>
'But what a mercy no man stayed in her,' said Bell.</DD>

<DD>
'Why, mistress, I reckon we a' must die some way; and I'd as soon go down
into the deep waters as be choked up wi' moulds.'</DD>

<DD>
'But it must be so cold,' said Sylvia, shuddering and giving a little poke
to the fire to warm her fancy.</DD>

<DD>
'Cold!' said her father, 'what do ye stay-at-homes know about cold, a should
like to know? If yo'd been where a were once, north latitude 81, in such
a frost as ye ha' niver known, no, not i' deep winter, and it were June
i' them seas, and a whale i' sight, and a were off in a boat after her:
an' t' ill-mannered brute, as soon as she were harpooned, ups wi' her big
awkward tail, and struck t' boat i' her stern, and chucks me out into t'
watter. That were cold, a can tell the'! First, I smarted all ower me,
as if my skin were suddenly stript off me: and next, ivery bone i' my body
had getten t' toothache, and there were a great roar i' my ears, an' a
great dizziness i' my eyes; an' t' boat's crew kept throwin' out their
oars, an' a kept clutchin' at 'em, but a could na' make out where they
was, my eyes dazzled so wi' t' cold, an' I thought I were bound for "kingdom
come," an' a tried to remember t' Creed, as a might die a Christian. But
all a could think on was, "What is your name, M or N?" an' just as a were
giving up both words and life, they heaved me aboard. But, bless ye, they
had but one oar; for they'd thrown a' t' others after me; so yo' may reckon,
it were some time afore we could reach t' ship; an', a've heerd tell, a
were a precious sight to look on, for my clothes was just hard frozen to
me, an' my hair a'most as big a lump o' ice as yon iceberg he was a-telling
us on; they rubbed me as missus theere were rubbing t' hams yesterday,
and gav' me brandy; an' a've niver getten t' frost out o' my bones for
a' their rubbin', and a deal o' brandy as I 'ave ta'on sin'. Talk o' cold!
it's little yo' women known o' cold!'</DD>

<DD>
'But there's heat, too, i' some places,' said Kinraid. I was once a voyage
i' an American. They goes for th' most part south, to where you come round
to t' cold again; and they'll stay there for three year at a time, if need
be, going into winter harbour i' some o' th' Pacific Islands. Well, we
were i' th' southern seas, a-seeking for good whaling-ground; and, close
on our larboard beam, there were a great wall o' ice, as much as sixty
feet high. And says our captain--as were a dare-devil, if ever a man were--"There'll
be an opening in yon dark gray wall, and into that opening I'll sail, if
I coast along it till th' day o' judgment." But, for all our sailing, we
never seemed to come nearer to th' opening. The waters were rocking beneath
us, and the sky were steady above us; and th' ice rose out o' the waters,
and seemed to reach up into the sky. We sailed on, and we sailed on, for
more days nor I could count. Our captain were a strange, wild man, but
once he looked a little pale when he came upo' deck after his turn-in and
saw the green-gray ice going straight up on our beam. Many on us thought
as the ship were bewitched for th' captain's words; and we got to speak
low, and to say our prayers o' nights, and a kind o' dull silence came
into th' very air; our voices did na' rightly seem our own. And we sailed
on, and we sailed on. All at once, th' man as were on watch gave a cry:
he saw a break in the ice, as we'd begun to think were everlasting; and
we all gathered towards the bows, and the captain called to th' man at
the helm to keep her course, and cocked his head, and began to walk the
quarter-deck jaunty again. And we came to a great cleft in th' long weary
rock of ice; and the sides o' th' cleft were not jagged, but went straight
sharp down into th' foaming waters. But we took but one look at what lay
inside, for our captain, with a loud cry to God, bade the helmsman steer
nor'ards away fra' th' mouth o' Hell. We all saw wi' our own eyes, inside
that fearsome wall o' ice--seventy miles long, as we could swear to--inside
that gray, cold ice, came leaping flames, all red and yellow wi' heat o'
some unearthly kind out o' th' very waters o' the sea; making our eyes
dazzle wi' their scarlet blaze, that shot up as high, nay, higher than
th' ice around, yet never so much as a shred on 't was melted. They did
say that some beside our captain saw the black devils dart hither and thither,
quicker than the very flames themselves; anyhow, he saw them. And as he
knew it were his own daring as had led him to have that peep at terrors
forbidden to any on us afore our time, he just dwined away, and we hadn't
taken but one whale afore our captain died, and first mate took th' command.
It were a prosperous voyage; but, for all that, I'll never sail those seas
again, nor ever take wage aboard an American again.'</DD>

<DD>
'Eh, dear! but it's awful t' think o' sitting wi' a man that has seen th'
doorway into hell,' said Bell, aghast.</DD>

<DD>
Sylvia had dropped her work, and sat gazing at Kinraid with fascinated
wonder.</DD>

<DD>
Daniel was just a little annoyed at the admiration which his own wife and
daughter were bestowing on the specksioneer's wonderful stories, and he
said--</DD>

<DD>
'Ay, ay. If a'd been a talker, ye'd ha' thought a deal more on me nor ye've
iver done yet. A've seen such things, and done such things.'</DD>

<DD>
'Tell us, father!' said Sylvia, greedy and breathless.</DD>

<DD>
'Some on 'em is past telling,' he replied, 'an some is not to be had for
t' asking, seeing as how they might bring a man into trouble. But, as a
said, if a had a fancy to reveal all as is on my mind a could make t' hair
on your heads lift up your caps--well, we'll say an inch, at least. Thy
mother, lass, has heerd one or two on 'em. Thou minds the story o' my ride
on a whale's back, Bell? That'll maybe be within this young fellow's comprehension
o' t' danger; thou's heerd me tell it, hastn't ta?'</DD>

<DD>
'Yes,' said Bell; 'but it's a long time ago; when we was courting.'</DD>

<DD>
'An' that's afore this young lass were born, as is a'most up to woman's
estate. But sin' those days a ha' been o'er busy to tell stories to my
wife, an' as a'll warrant she's forgotten it; an' as Sylvia here niver
heerd it, if yo'll fill your glass, Kinraid, yo' shall ha' t' benefit o't.</DD>

<DD>
'A were a specksioneer mysel, though, after that, a rayther directed my
talents int' t' smuggling branch o' my profession; but a were once a whaling
aboord t' <I>Aimwell</I> of Whitby. An' we was anchored off t' coast o'
Greenland one season; an we'd getten a cargo o' seven whale; but our captain
he were a keen-eyed chap, an' niver above doin' any man's work; an' once
seem' a whale he throws himself int' a boat an' goes off to it, makin'
signals to me, an' another specksioneer as were off for diversion i' another
boat, for to come after him sharp. Well, afore we comes alongside, captain
had harpooned t' fish; an' says he, "Now, Robson, all ready! give into
her again when she comes to t' top;" an' I stands up, right leg foremost,
harpoon all ready, as soon as iver I cotched a sight o' t' whale, but niver
a fin could a see. 'Twere no wonder, for she were right below t' boat in
which a were; and when she wanted to rise, what does t' great ugly brute
do but come wi' her head, as is like cast iron, up bang again t' bottom
o' t' boat. I were thrown up in t' air like a shuttlecock, me an' my line
an' my harpoon--up we goes, an' many a good piece o' timber wi' us, an'
many a good fellow too; but a had t' look after mysel', an a were up high
i' t' air, afore I could say Jack Robinson, an' a thowt a were safe for
another dive int' saut water; but, i'stead a comes down plump on t' back
o' t' whale. Ay! yo' may stare, master but theere a were, an' main an'
slippery it were, only a sticks my harpoon intil her an' steadies mysel',
an' looks abroad o'er t' vast o' waves, and gets sea-sick in a manner,
an' puts up a prayer as she mayn't dive, and it were as good a prayer for
wishin' it might come true as iver t' clargyman an' t' clerk too puts up
i' Monkshaven church. Well, a reckon it were heerd, for all a were i' them
north latitudes, for she keeps steady, an' a does my best for t' keep steady;
an' 'deed a was too steady, for a was fast wi' t' harpoon line, all knotted
and tangled about me. T' captain, he sings out for me to cut it; but it's
easy singin' out, and it's noane so easy fumblin' for your knife i' t'
pocket o' your drawers, when yo've t' hold hard wi' t' other hand on t'
back of a whale, swimmin' fourteen knots an hour. At last a thinks to mysel'
a can't get free o' t' line, and t' line is fast to t' harpoon, and t'
harpoon is fast to t' whale; and t' whale may go down fathoms deep wheniver
t' maggot stirs i' her head; an' t' watter's cold, an noane good for drownin'
in; a can't get free o' t' line, and a connot get my knife out o' my breeches
pocket though t' captain should ca' it mutiny to disobey orders, and t'
line's fast to t' harpoon--let's see if t' harpoon's fast to t' whale.
So a tugged, and a lugged, and t' whale didn't mistake it for ticklin',
but she cocks up her tail, and throws out showers o' water as were ice
or iver it touched me; but a pulls on at t' shank, an' a were only afeard
as she wouldn't keep at t' top wi' it sticking in her; but at last t' harpoon
broke, an' just i' time, for a reckon she was near as tired o' me as a
were on her, and down she went; an' a had hard work to make for t' boats
as was near enough to catch me; for what wi' t' whale's being but slippery
an' t' watter being cold, an' me hampered wi' t' line an' t' piece o' harpoon,
it's a chance, missus, as thou had stopped an oud maid.'</DD>

<DD>
'Eh dear a' me!' said Bell, 'how well I mind yo'r telling me that tale!
It were twenty-four year ago come October. I thought I never could think
enough on a man as had rode on a whale's back!'</DD>

<DD>
'Yo' may learn t' way of winnin' t' women,' said Daniel, winking at the
specksioneer.</DD>

<DD>
And Kinraid immediately looked at Sylvia. It was no premeditated action;
it came as naturally as wakening in the morning when his sleep was ended;
but Sylvia coloured as red as any rose at his sudden glance,--coloured
so deeply that he looked away until he thought she had recovered her composure,
and then he sat gazing at her again. But not for long, for Bell suddenly
starting up, did all but turn him out of the house. It was late, she said,
and her master was tired, and they had a hard day before them next day;
and it was keeping Ellen Corney up; and they had had enough to drink,--more
than was good for them, she was sure, for they had both been taking her
in with their stories which she had been foolish enough to believe. No
one saw the real motive of all this almost inhospitable haste to dismiss
her guest, how the sudden fear had taken possession of her that he and
Sylvia were 'fancying each other.' Kinraid had said early in the evening
that he had come to thank her for her kindness in sending the sausages,
as he was off to his own home near Newcastle in a day or two. But now he
said, in reply to Daniel Robson, that he would step in another night before
long and hear some more of the old man's yarns.</DD>

<DD>
Daniel had just had enough drink to make him very good-tempered, or else
his wife would not have dared to have acted as she did; and this maudlin
amiability took the shape of hospitable urgency that Kinraid should come
as often as he liked to Haytersbank; come and make it his home when he
was in these parts; stay there altogether, and so on, till Bell fairly
shut the outer door to, and locked it before the specksioneer had well
got out of the shadow of their roof.</DD>

<DD>
All night long Sylvia dreamed of burning volcanoes springing out of icy
southern seas. But, as in the specksioneer's tale the flames were peopled
with demons, there was no human interest for her in the wondrous scene
in which she was no actor, only a spectator. With daylight came wakening
and little homely everyday wonders. Did Kinraid mean that he was going
away really and entirely, or did he not? Was he Molly Corney's sweetheart,
or was he not? When she had argued herself into certainty on one side,
she suddenly wheeled about, and was just of the opposite opinion. At length
she settled that it could not be settled until she saw Molly again; so,
by a strong gulping effort, she resolutely determined to think no more
about him, only about the marvels he had told. She might think a little
about them when she sat at night, spinning in silence by the household
fire. or when she went out in the gloaming to call the cattle home to be
milked, and sauntered back behind the patient, slow-gaited creatures; and
at times on future summer days, when, as in the past, she took her knitting
out for the sake of the freshness of the faint sea-breeze, and dropping
down from ledge to ledge of the rocks that faced the blue ocean, established
herself in a perilous nook that had been her haunt ever since her parents
had come to Haytersbank Farm. From thence she had often seen the distant
ships pass to and fro, with a certain sort of lazy pleasure in watching
their swift tranquillity of motion, but no thought as to where they were
bound to, or what strange places they would penetrate to before they turned
again, homeward bound.</DD>
