All this enlargement of interest in the shop occupied Philip fully for
some months after the period referred to in the preceding chapter. Remembering
his last conversation with his aunt, he might have been uneasy at his inability
to perform his promise and look after his pretty cousin, but that about
the middle of November Bell Robson had fallen ill of a rheumatic fever,
and that her daughter had been entirely absorbed in nursing her. No thought
of company or gaiety was in Sylvia's mind as long as her mother's illness
lasted; vehement in all her feelings, she discovered in the dread of losing
her mother how passionately she was attached to her. Hitherto she had supposed,
as children so often do, that her parents would live for ever; and now
when it was a question of days, whether by that time the following week
her mother might not be buried out of her sight for ever, she clung to
every semblance of service to be rendered, or affection shown, as if she
hoped to condense the love and care of years into the few days only that
might remain. Mrs Robson lingered on, began slowly to recover, and before
Christmas was again sitting by the fireside in the house-place, wan and
pulled down, muffled up with shawls and blankets, but still there once
more, where not long before Sylvia had scarcely expected to see her again.
Philip came up that evening and found Sylvia in wild spirits. She thought
that everything was done, now that her mother had once come downstairs
again; she laughed with glee; she kissed her mother; she shook hands with
Philip, she almost submitted to a speech of more than usual tenderness
from him; but, in the midst of his words, her mother's pillows wanted arranging
and she went to her chair, paying no more heed to his words than if they
had been addressed to the cat, that lying on the invalid's knee was purring
out her welcome to the weak hand feebly stroking her back. Robson himself
soon came in, looking older and more subdued since Philip had seen him
last. He was very urgent that his wife should have some spirits and water;
but on her refusal, almost as if she loathed the thought of the smell,
he contented himself with sharing her tea, though he kept abusing the beverage
as 'washing the heart out of a man,' and attributing all the degeneracy
of the world, growing up about him in his old age, to the drinking of such
slop. At the same time, his little self-sacrifice put him in an unusually
good temper; and, mingled with his real gladness at having his wife once
more on the way to recovery, brought back some of the old charm of tenderness
combined with light-heartedness, which had won the sober Isabella Preston
long ago. He sat by her side, holding her hand, and talking of old times
to the young couple opposite; of his adventures and escapes, and how he
had won his wife. She, faintly smiling at the remembrance of those days,
yet half-ashamed at having the little details of her courtship revealed,
from time to time kept saying,--

<P>'For shame wi' thee, Dannel--I never did,' and faint denials of a similar
kind.

<P>'Niver believe her, Sylvie. She were a woman, and there's niver a woman
but likes to have a sweetheart, and can tell when a chap's castin' sheep's-eyes
at her; ay, an' afore he knows what he's about hissen. She were a pretty
one then, was my old 'ooman, an' liked them as thought her so, though she
did cock her head high, as bein' a Preston, which were a family o' standin'
and means 1 those parts aforetime. There's Philip there, I'll warrant,
is as proud o' bein' Preston by t' mother's side, for it runs i' t' blood,
lass. A can tell when a child of a Preston tak's to being proud o' their
kin, by t' cut o' their nose. Now Philip's and my missus has a turn beyond
common i' their nostrils, as if they was sniffin' at t' rest of us world,
an' seein' if we was good enough for 'em to consort wi'. Thee an' me, lass,
is Robsons--oat-cake folk, while they's pie-crust. Lord how Bell used to
speak to me, as short as though a wasn't a Christian, an' a' t' time she
loved me as her very life, an' well a knew it, tho' a'd to mak' as tho'
a didn't. Philip, when thou goes courtin', come t' me, and a'll give thee
many a wrinkle. A've shown' too, as a know well how t' choose a good wife
by tokens an' signs, hannot a, missus? Come t' me, my lad, and show me
t' lass, an' a'll just tak' a squint at her, an' tell yo' if she'll do
or not; an' if she'll do, a'll teach yo' how to win her.'

<P>'They say another o' yon Corney girls is going to be married,' said
Mrs Robson, in her faint deliberate tones.

<P>'By gosh an' it's well thou'st spoke on 'em; a was as clean forgettin'
it as iver could be. A met Nanny Corney i' Monkshaven last neet, and she
axed me for t' let our Sylvia come o' New Year's Eve, an' see Molly an'
her man, that 'n as is wed beyond Newcassel, they'll be over at her feyther's,
for t' New Year, an' there's to be a merry-making.'

<P>Sylvia's colour came, her eyes brightened, she would have liked to go;
but the thought of her mother came across her, and her features fell. Her
mother's eye caught the look and the change, and knew what both meant as
well as if Sylvia had spoken out.

<P>'Thursday se'nnight,' said she. 'I'll be rare and strong by then, and
Sylvie shall go play hersen; she's been nurse-tending long enough.'

<P>'You're but weakly yet,' said Philip shortly; he did not intend to say
it, but the words seemed to come out in spite of himself.

<P>'A said as our lass should come, God willin', if she only came and went,
an' thee goin' on sprightly, old 'ooman. An' a'll turn nurse-tender mysen
for t' occasion, 'special if thou can stand t' good honest smell o' whisky
by then. So, my lass, get up thy smart clothes, and cut t' best on 'em
out, as becomes a Preston. Maybe, a'll fetch thee home, an' maybe Philip
will convoy thee, for Nanny Corney bade thee to t' merry-making, as well.
She said her measter would be seem' thee about t' wool afore then.'

<P>'I don't think as I can go,' said Philip, secretly pleased to know that
he had the opportunity in his power; 'I'm half bound to go Wi' Hester Rose
and her mother to t' watch-night.'

<P>'Is Hester a Methodee?' asked Sylvia in surprise.

<P>'No! she's neither a Methodee, nor a Friend, nor a Church person; but
she's a turn for serious things, choose wherever they're found.'

<P>'Well, then,' said good-natured farmer Robson, only seeing the surface
of things, 'a'll make shift to fetch Sylvie back fra' t' merry-making,
and thee an' thy young woman can go to t' prayer-makin'; it's every man
to his taste, say I.'

<P>But in spite of his half-promise, nay against his natural inclination,
Philip was lured to the Corneys' by the thought of meeting Sylvia, of watching
her and exulting in her superiority in pretty looks and ways to all the
other girls likely to be assembled. Besides (he told his conscience) he
was pledged to his aunt to watch over Sylvia like a brother. So in the
interval before New Year's Eve, he silently revelled as much as any young
girl in the anticipation of the happy coming time.

<P>At this hour, all the actors in this story having played out their parts
and gone to their rest, there is something touching in recording the futile
efforts made by Philip to win from Sylvia the love he yearned for. But,
at the time, any one who had watched him might have been amused to see
the grave, awkward, plain young man studying patterns and colours for a
new waistcoat, with his head a little on one side, after the meditative
manner common to those who are choosing a new article of dress. They might
have smiled could they have read in his imagination the frequent rehearsals
of the coming evening, when he and she should each be dressed in their
gala attire, to spend a few hours under a bright, festive aspect, among
people whose company would oblige them to assume a new demeanour towards
each other, not so familiar as their everyday manner, but allowing more
scope for the expression of rustic gallantry. Philip had so seldom been
to anything of the kind, that, even had Sylvia not been going, he would
have felt a kind of shy excitement at the prospect of anything so unusual.
But, indeed, if Sylvia had not been going, it is very probable that Philip's
rigid conscience might have been aroused to the question whether such parties
did not savour too much of the world for him to form one in them.

<P>As it was, however, the facts to him were simply these. He was going
and she was going. The day before, he had hurried off to Haytersbank Farm
with a small paper parcel in his pocket--a ribbon with a little briar-rose
pattern running upon it for Sylvia. It was the first thing he had ever
ventured to give her--the first thing of the kind would, perhaps, be more
accurate; for when he had first begun to teach her any lessons, he had
given her Mavor's Spelling-book, but that he might have done, out of zeal
for knowledge, to any dunce of a little girl of his acquaintance. This
ribbon was quite a different kind of present; he touched it tenderly, as
if he were caressing it, when he thought of her wearing it; the briar-rose
(sweetness and thorns) seemed to be the very flower for her; the soft,
green ground on which the pink and brown pattern ran, was just the colour
to show off her complexion. And she would in a way belong to him her cousin,
her mentor, her chaperon' her lover! While others only admired, he might
hope to appropriate; for of late they had been such happy friends! Her
mother approved of him, her father liked him. A few months, perhaps only
a few weeks more of self-restraint, and then he might go and speak openly
of his wishes, and what he had to offer. For he had resolved, with the
quiet force of his character, to wait until all was finally settled between
him and his masters, before he declared himself to either Sylvia or her
parents. The interval was spent in patient, silent endeavours to recommend
himself to her.

<P>He had to give his ribbon to his aunt in charge for Sylvia, and that
was a disappointment to his fancy, although he tried to reason himself
into thinking that it was better so. He had not time to wait for her return
from some errand on which she had gone, for he was daily more and more
occupied with the affairs of the shop.

<P>Sylvia made many a promise to her mother, and more to herself, that
she would not stay late at the party, but she might go as early as she
liked; and before the December daylight had faded away, Sylvia presented
herself at the Corneys'. She was to come early in order to help to set
out the supper, which was arranged in the large old flagged parlour, which
served as best bed-room as well. It opened out of the house-place, and
was the sacred room of the house, as chambers of a similar description
are still considered in retired farmhouses in the north of England. They
are used on occasions like the one now described for purposes of hospitality;
but in the state bed, overshadowing so large a portion of the floor, the
births and, as far as may be, the deaths, of the household take place.
At the Corneys', the united efforts of some former generation of the family
had produced patchwork curtains and coverlet; and patchwork was patchwork
in those days, before the early Yates and Peels had found out the secret
of printing the parsley-leaf. Scraps of costly Indian chintzes and palempours
were intermixed with commoner black and red calico in minute hexagons;
and the variety of patterns served for the useful purpose of promoting
conversation as well as the more obvious one of displaying the work-woman
's taste. Sylvia, for instance, began at once to her old friend, Molly
Brunton, who had accompanied her into this chamber to take off her hat
and cloak, with a remark on one of the chintzes. Stooping over the counterpane,
with a face into which the flush would come whether or no, she said to
Molly,--

<P>'Dear! I never seed this one afore--this--for all t' world like th'
eyes in a peacock's tall.'

<P>'Thou's seen it many a time and oft, lass. But weren't thou surprised
to find Charley here? We picked him up at Shields, quite by surprise like;
and when Brunton and me said as we was comin' here, nought would serve
him but comin' with us, for t' see t' New Year in. It's a pity as your
mother's ta'en this tune for t' fall ill and want yo' back so early.'

<P>Sylvia had taken off her hat and cloak by this time, and began to help
Molly and a younger unmarried sister in laying out the substantial supper.

<P>'Here,' continued Mrs Brunton; 'stick a bit o' holly i' yon pig's mouth,
that's the way we do things i' Newcassel; but folks is so behindhand in
Monkshaven. It's a fine thing to live in a large town, Sylvia; an' if yo're
looking out for a husband, I'd advise yo' to tak' one as lives in a town.
I feel as if I were buried alive comin' back here, such an out-o'-t'-way
place after t' Side, wheere there's many a hundred carts and carriages
goes past in a day. I've a great mind for t' tak yo' two lassies back Wi'
me, and let yo' see a bit o' t' world; maybe, I may yet.

<P>Her sister Bessy looked much pleased with this plan, but Sylvia was
rather inclined to take offence at Molly's patronizing ways, and replied,--

<P>'I'm none so fond o' noise and bustle; why, yo'll not be able to hear
yoursels speak wi' all them carts and carriages. I'd rayther bide at home;
let alone that mother can't spare me.'

<P>It was, perhaps, a rather ungracious way of answering Molly Brunton's
speech, and so she felt it to be, although her invitation had been none
of the most courteously worded. She irritated Sylvia still further by repeating
her last words,--

<P>'"Mother can't spare me;" why, mother 'll have to spare thee sometime,
when t' time for wedding comes.'

<P>'I'm none going to be wed,' said Sylvia; 'and if I were, I'd niver go
far fra' mother.'

<P>'Eh! what a spoilt darling it is. How Brunton will laugh when I tell
him about yo'; Brunton's a rare one for laughin'. It's a great thing to
have got such a merry man for a husband. Why! he has his joke for every
one as comes into t' shop; and he'll ha' something funny to say to everything
this evenin'.'

<P>Bessy saw that Sylvia was annoyed, and, with more delicacy than her
sister, she tried to turn the conversation.

<P>'That's a pretty ribbon in thy hair, Sylvia; I'd like to have one o'
t' same pattern. Feyther likes pickled walnuts stuck about t' round o'
beef, Molly.'

<P>'I know what I'm about,' replied Mrs Brunton, with a toss of her married
head.

<P>Bessy resumed her inquiry.

<P>'Is there any more to be had wheere that come fra', Sylvia?'

<P>'I don't know,' replied Sylvia. 'It come fra' Foster's, and yo' can
ask.'

<P>'What might it cost?' said Betsy, fingering an end of it to test its
quality.

<P>'I can't tell,' said Sylvia, 'it were a present.'

<P>'Niver mak' ado about t' price,' said Molly; 'I'll gi'e thee enough
on 't to tie up thy hair, just like Sylvia's. Only thou hastn't such wealth
o' curls as she has; it'll niver look t' same i' thy straight locks. And
who might it be as give it thee, Sylvia?' asked the unscrupulous, if good-natured
Molly.

<P>'My cousin Philip, him as is shopman at Foster's,' said Sylvia, innocently.
But it was far too good an opportunity for the exercise of Molly's kind
of wit for her to pass over.

<P>'Oh, oh! our cousin Philip, is it? and he'll not be living so far away
from your mother? I've no need be a witch to put two and two together.
He's a coming here to-night, isn't he, Bessy?'

<P>'I wish yo' wouldn't talk so, Molly,' said Sylvia; 'me and Philip is
good enough friends, but we niver think on each other in that way; leastways,
I don't

<P>'(Sweet butter! now that's my mother's old-fashioned way; as if folks
must eat sweet butter now-a-days, because her mother did!) That way,' continued
Molly, in the manner that annoyed Sylvia so much, repeating her words as
if for the purpose of laughing at them. '"That way?" and pray what is t'
way yo're speaking on? I niver said nought about marrying, did I, that
yo' need look so red and shamefaced about yo'r cousin Philip? But, as Brunton
says, if t' cap fits yo', put it on. I'm glad he's comin' to-night tho',
for as I'm done makin' love and courtin', it's next best t' watch other
folks; an' yo'r face, Sylvia, has letten me into a secret, as I'd some
glimpses on afore I was wed.'

<P>Sylvia secretly determined not to speak a word more to Philip than she
could help, and wondered how she could ever have liked Molly at all, much
less have made a companion of her. The table was now laid out, and nothing
remained but to criticise the arrangement a little.

<P>Bessy was full of admiration.

<P>'Theere, Molly!' said she. 'Yo' niver seed more vittle brought together
i' Newcassel, I'll be bound; there'll be above half a hundredweight o'
butcher's meat, beside pies and custards. I've eaten no dinner these two
days for thinking on 't; it's been a weary burden on my mind, but it's
off now I see how well it looks. I told mother not to come near it till
we'd spread it all out, and now I'll go fetch her.'

<P>Bessy ran off into the house-place.

<P>'It's well enough in a country kind o' way,' said Molly, with the faint
approbation of condescension. 'But if I'd thought on, I'd ha' brought 'em
down a beast or two done i' sponge-cake, wi' currants for his eyes to give
t' table an air.'

<P>The door was opened, and Bessy came in smiling and blushing with proud
pleasure. Her mother followed her on tip-toe, smoothing down her apron,
and with her voice subdued to a whisper:--

<P>'Ay, my lass, it <I>is</I> fine! But dunnot mak' an ado about it, let
'em think it's just our common way. If any one says aught about how good
t' vittle is, tak' it calm, and say we'n better i' t' house,--it'll mak'
'em eat Wi' a better appetite, and think the more on us. Sylvie, I'm much
beholden t' ye for comin' so early, and helpin' t' lasses, but yo' mun
come in t' house-place now, t' folks is gatherin', an' yo'r cousin's been
asking after yo' a'ready.'

<P>Molly gave her a nudge, which made Sylvia's face go all aflame with
angry embarrassment. She was conscious that the watching which Molly had
threatened her with began directly; for Molly went up to her husband, and
whispered something to him which set him off in a chuckling laugh, and
Sylvia was aware that his eyes followed her about with knowing looks all
the evening. She would hardly speak to Philip, and pretended not to see
his outstretched hand, but passed on to the chimney-corner, and tried to
shelter herself behind the broad back of farmer Corney, who had no notion
of relinquishing his customary place for all the young people who ever
came to the house,--or for any old people either, for that matter. It was
his household throne, and there he sat with no more idea of abdicating
in favour of any comer than King George at St James's. But he was glad
to see his friends; and had paid them the unwonted compliment of shaving
on a week-day, and putting on his Sunday coat. The united efforts of wife
and children had failed to persuade him to make any farther change in his
attire; to all their arguments on this head he had replied,--

<P>'Them as doesn't like t' see me i' my work-a-day wescut and breeches
may bide away.'

<P>It was the longest sentence he said that day, but he repeated it several
times over. He was glad enough to see all the young people, but they were
not 'of his kidney,' as he expressed it to himself, and he did not feel
any call upon himself to entertain them. He left that to his bustling wife,
all smartness and smiles, and to his daughters and son-in-law. His efforts
at hospitality consisted in sitting still, smoking his pipe; when any one
came, he took it out of his mouth for an instant, and nodded his head in
a cheerful friendly way, without a word of speech; and then returned to
his smoking with the greater relish for the moment's intermission. He thought
to himself:--

<P>'They're a set o' young chaps as thinks more on t' lasses than on baccy;--they'll
find out their mistake in time; give 'em time, give 'em time.'

<P>And before eight o'clock, he went as quietly as a man of twelve stone
can upstairs to bed, having made a previous arrangement with his wife that
she should bring him up about two pounds of spiced beef, and a hot tumbler
of stiff grog. But at the beginning of the evening he formed a good screen
for Sylvia, who was rather a favourite with the old man, for twice he spoke
to her.

<P>'Feyther smokes?'

<P>'Yes,' said Sylvia.

<P>'Reach me t' baccy-box, my lass.'

<P>And that was all the conversation that passed between her and her nearest
neighbour for the first quarter of an hour after she came into company.

<P>But, for all her screen, she felt a pair of eyes were fixed upon her
with a glow of admiration deepening their honest brightness. Somehow, look
in what direction she would, she caught the glance of those eyes before
she could see anything else. So she played with her apron-strings, and
tried not to feel so conscious. There were another pair of eyes,--not such
beautiful, sparkling eyes,--deep-set, earnest, sad, nay, even gloomy, watching
her every movement; but of this she was not aware. Philip had not recovered
from the rebuff she had given him by refusing his offered hand, and was
standing still, in angry silence, when Mrs Corney thrust a young woman
just arrived upon his attention.

<P>'Come, Measter Hepburn, here's Nancy Pratt wi'out ev'n a soul to speak
t' her, an' yo' mopin' theere. She says she knows yo' by sight fra' having
dealt at Foster's these six year. See if yo' can't find summut t' say t'
each other, for I mun go pour out tea. Dixons, an' Walkers, an' Elliotts,
an' Smiths is come, said she, marking off the families on her fingers,
as she looked round and called over their names; ' an' there's only Will
Latham an' his two sisters, and Roger Harbottle, an' Taylor t' come an'
they'll turn up afore tea's ended.'

<P>So she went off to her duty at the one table, which, placed alongside
of the dresser, was the only article of furniture left in the middle of
the room: all the seats being arranged as close to the four walls as could
be managed. The candles of those days gave but a faint light compared to
the light of the immense fire, which it was a point of hospitality to keep
at the highest roaring, blazing pitch; the young women occupied the seats,
with the exception of two or three of the elder ones, who, in an eager
desire to show their capability, insisted on helping Mrs Corney in her
duties, very much to her annoyance, as there were certain little contrivances
for eking out cream, and adjusting the strength of the cups of tea to the
worldly position of the intended drinkers, which she did not like every
one to see. The young men,--whom tea did not embolden, and who had as yet
had no chance of stronger liquor,--clustered in rustic shyness round the
door, not speaking even to themselves, except now and then, when one, apparently
the wag of the party, made some whispered remark, which set them all off
laughing; but in a minute they checked themselves, and passed the back
of their hands across their mouths to compose that unlucky feature, and
then some would try to fix their eyes on the rafters of the ceiling, in
a manner which was decorous if rather abstracted from the business in hand.
Most of these were young farmers, with whom Philip had nothing in common,
and from whom, in shy reserve, he had withdrawn himself when he first came
in. But now he wished himself among them sooner than set to talk to Nancy
Pratt, when he had nothing to say. And yet he might have had a companion
less to his mind, for she was a decent young woman of a sober age, less
inclined to giggle than many of the younger ones. But all the time that
he was making commonplace remarks to her he was wondering if he had offended
Sylvia, and why she would not shake hands with him, and this pre-occupation
of his thoughts did not make him an agreeable companion. Nancy Pratt, who
had been engaged for some years to a mate of a whaling-ship, perceived
something of his state of mind, and took no offence at it; on the contrary,
she tried to give him pleasure by admiring Sylvia.

<P>'I've often heerd tell on her,' said she, 'but I niver thought she's
be so pretty, and so staid and quiet-like too. T' most part o' girls as
has looks like hers are always gape-gazing to catch other folks's eyes,
and see what is thought on 'em; but she looks just like a child, a bit
flustered wi' coming into company, and gettin' into as dark a corner and
bidin' as still as she can.

<P>Just then Sylvia lifted up her long, dark lashes, and catching the same
glance which she had so often met before--Charley Kinraid was standing
talking to Brunton on the opposite side of the fire-place--she started
back into the shadow as if she had not expected it, and in so doing spilt
her tea all over her gown. She could almost have cried, she felt herself
so awkward, and as if everything was going wrong with her; she thought
that every one would think she had never been in company before, and did
not know how to behave; and while she was thus fluttered and crimson, she
saw through her tearful eyes Kinraid on his knees before her, wiping her
gown with his silk pocket handkerchief, and heard him speaking through
all the buzz of commiserating voices.

<P>'Your cupboard handle is so much i' th' way--I hurt my elbow against
it only this very afternoon.'

<P>So perhaps it was no clumsiness of hers,--as they would all know, now,
since he had so skilfully laid the blame somewhere else; and after all
it turned out that her accident had been the means of bringing him across
to her side, which was much more pleasant than having him opposite, staring
at her; for now he began to talk to her, and this was very pleasant, although
she was rather embarrassed at their <I>tete-a-tete</I> at first.

<P>'I did not know you again when I first saw you,' said he, in a tone
which implied a good deal more than was uttered in words.

<P>'I knowed yo' at once,' she replied, softly, and then she blushed and
played with her apron-string, and wondered if she ought to have confessed
to the clearness of her recollection.

<P>'You're grown up into--well, perhaps it's not manners to say what you're
grown into--anyhow, I shan't forget yo' again.'

<P>More playing with her apron-string, and head hung still lower down,
though the corners of her mouth would go up in a shy smile of pleasure.
Philip watched it all as greedily as if it gave him delight.

<P>'Yo'r father, he'll be well and hearty, I hope? ' asked Charley.

<P>'Yes,' replied Sylvia, and then she wished she could originate some
remark; he would think her so stupid if she just kept on saying such little
short bits of speeches, and if he thought her stupid he might perhaps go
away again to his former place.

<P>But he was quite far enough gone in love of her beauty, and pretty modest
ways, not to care much whether she talked or no, so long as she showed
herself so pleasingly conscious of his close neighbourhood.

<P>'I must come and see the old gentleman; and your mother, too,' he added
more slowly, for he remembered that his visits last year had not been quite
so much welcomed by Bell Robson as by her husband; perhaps it was because
of the amount of drink which he and Daniel managed to get through of an
evening. He resolved this year to be more careful to please the mother
of Sylvia.

<P>When tea was ended there was a great bustle and shifting of places,
while Mrs Corney and her daughters carried out trays full of used cups,
and great platters of uneaten bread and butter into the back-kitchen, to
be washed up after the guests were gone. Just because she was so conscious
that she did not want to move, and break up the little conversation between
herself and Kinraid, Sylvia forced herself to be as active in the service
going on as became a friend of the house; and she was too much her mother's
own daughter to feel comfortable at leaving all the things in the disorder
which to the Corney girls was second nature.

<P>'This milk mun go back to t' dairy, I reckon,' said she, loading herself
with milk and cream.

<P>'Niver fash thysel' about it,' said Nelly Corney, 'Christmas comes but
onest a year, if it does go sour; and mother said she'd have a game at
forfeits first thing after tea to loosen folks's tongues, and mix up t'
lads and lasses, so come along.'

<P>But Sylvia steered her careful way to the cold chill of the dairy, and
would not be satisfied till she had carried away all the unused provision
into some fresher air than that heated by the fires and ovens used for
the long day's cooking of pies and cakes and much roast meat.

<P>When they came back a round of red-faced ' lads,' as young men up to
five-and-thirty are called in Lancashire and York-shire if they are not
married before, and lasses, whose age was not to be defined, were playing
at some country game, in which the women were apparently more interested
than the men, who looked shamefaced, and afraid of each other's ridicule.
Mrs Corney, however, knew how to remedy this, and at a sign from her a
great jug of beer was brought in. This jug was the pride of her heart,
and was in the shape of a fat man in white knee-breeches, and a three-cornered
hat; with one arm he supported the pipe in his broad, smiling mouth, and
the other was placed akimbo and formed the handle. There was also a great
china punch-bowl filled with grog made after an old ship-receipt current
in these parts, but not too strong, because if their visitors had too much
to drink at that early part of the evening 'it would spoil t' fun,' as
Nelly Corney had observed. Her father, however, after the notions of hospitality
prevalent at that time in higher circles, had stipulated that each man
should have 'enough' before he left the house; enough meaning in Monkshaven
parlance the liberty of getting drunk, if they thought fit to do it.

<P>Before long one of the lads was seized with a fit of admiration for
Toby--the name of the old gentleman who contained liquor--and went up to
the tray for a closer inspection. He was speedily followed by other amateurs
of curious earthenware; and by-and-by Mr Brunton (who had been charged
by his mother-in-law with the due supplying of liquor--by his father-in-law
that every man should have his fill, and by his wife and her sisters that
no one should have too much, at any rate at the beginning of the evening,)
thought fit to carry out Toby to be replenished; and a faster spirit of
enjoyment and mirth began to reign in the room.

<P>Kinraid was too well seasoned to care what amount of liquor he drank;
Philip had what was called a weak head, and disliked muddling himself with
drink because of the immediate consequence of intense feelings of irritability,
and the more distant one of a racking headache next day; so both these
two preserved very much the same demeanour they had held at the beginning
of the evening.

<P>Sylvia was by all acknowledged and treated as the belle. When they played
at blind-man's-buff go where she would, she was always caught; she was
called out repeatedly to do what was required in any game, as if all had
a pleasure in seeing her light figure and deft ways. She was sufficiently
pleased with this to have got over her shyness with all except Charley.
When others paid her their rustic compliments she tossed her head, and
made her little saucy repartees; but when he said something low and flattering,
it was too honey-sweet to her heart to be thrown off thus. And, somehow,
the more she yielded to this fascination the more she avoided Philip. He
did not speak flatteringly--he did not pay compliments--he watched her
with discontented, longing eyes, and grew more inclined every moment, as
he remembered his anticipation of a happy evening, to cry out in his heart
<I>vanitas vanitatum</I>.

<P>And now came crying the forfeits. Molly Brunton knelt down, her face
buried in her mother's lap; the latter took out the forfeits one by one,
and as she held them up, said the accustomed formula,--

<P>'A fine thing and a very fine thing, what must he (or she) do who owns
this thing.'

<P>One or two had been told to kneel to the prettiest, bow to the wittiest,
and kiss those they loved best; others had had to bite an inch off the
poker, or such plays upon words. And now came Sylvia's pretty new ribbon
that Philip had given her (he almost longed to snatch it out of Mrs Corney's
hands and burn it before all their faces, so annoyed was he with the whole
affair.)

<P>'A fine thing and a very fine thing--a most particular fine thing--choose
how she came by it. What must she do as owns this thing?'

<P>'She must blow out t' candle and kiss t' candlestick.'

<P>In one instant Kinraid had hold of the only candle within reach, all
the others had been put up high on inaccessible shelves and other places.
Sylvia went up and blew out the candle, and before the sudden partial darkness
was over he had taken the candle into his fingers, and, according to the
traditional meaning of the words, was in the place of the candlestick,
and as such was to be kissed. Every one laughed at innocent Sylvia's face
as the meaning of her penance came into it, every one but Philip, who almost
choked.

<P>'I'm candlestick,' said Kinraid, with less of triumph in his voice than
he would have had with any other girl in the room.

<P>'Yo' mun kiss t' candlestick,' cried the Corneys, 'or yo'll niver get
yo'r ribbon back.'

<P>'And she sets a deal o' store by that ribbon,' said Molly Brunton, maliciously.

<P>'I'll none kiss t' candlestick, nor him either,' said Sylvia, in a low
voice of determination, turning away, full of confusion.

<P>'Yo'll not get yo'r ribbon if yo' dunnot,' cried one and all.

<P>'I don't care for t' ribbon,' said she, flashing up with a look at her
tormentors, now her back was turned to Kinraid. 'An' I wannot play any
more at such like games,' she added, with fresh indignation rising in her
heart as she took her old place in the corner of the room a little away
from the rest.

<P>Philip's spirits rose, and he yearned to go to her and tell her how
he approved of her conduct. Alas, Philip! Sylvia, though as modest a girl
as ever lived, was no prude, and had been brought up in simple, straightforward
country ways; and with any other young man, excepting, perhaps, Philip's
self, she would have thought no more of making a rapid pretence of kissing
the hand or cheek of the temporary 'candlestick,' than our ancestresses
did in a much higher rank on similar occasions. Kinraid, though mortified
by his public rejection, was more conscious of this than the inexperienced
Philip; he resolved not to be baulked, and watched his opportunity. For
the time he went on playing as if Sylvia's conduct had not affected him
in the least, and as if he was hardly aware of her defection from the game.
As she saw others submitting, quite as a matter of course, to similar penances,
she began to be angry with herself for having thought twice about it, and
almost to dislike herself for the strange consciousness which had made
it at the time seem impossible to do what she was told. Her eyes kept filling
with tears as her isolated position in the gay party, the thought of what
a fool she had made of herself, kept recurring to her mind; but no one
saw her, she thought, thus crying; and, ashamed to be discovered when the
party should pause in their game, she stole round behind them into the
great chamber in which she had helped to lay out the supper, with the intention
of bathing her eyes, and taking a drink of water. One instant Charley Kinraid
was missing from the circle of which he was the life and soul; and then
back he came with an air of satisfaction on his face, intelligible enough
to those who had seen his game; but unnoticed by Philip, who, amidst the
perpetual noise and movements around him, had not perceived Sylvia's leaving
the room, until she came back at the end of about a quarter of an hour,
looking lovelier than ever, her complexion brilliant, her eyes drooping,
her hair neatly and freshly arranged, tied with a brown ribbon instead
of that she was supposed to have forfeited. She looked as if she did not
wish her return to be noticed, stealing softly behind the romping lads
and lasses with noiseless motions, and altogether such a contrast to them
in her cool freshness and modest neatness, that both Kinraid and Philip
found it difficult to keep their eyes off her. But the former had a secret
triumph in his heart which enabled him to go on with his merry-making as
if it absorbed him; while Philip dropped out of the crowd and came up to
where she was standing silently by Mrs Corney, who, arms akimbo, was laughing
at the frolic and fun around her. Sylvia started a little when Philip spoke,
and kept her soft eyes averted from him after the first glance; she answered
him shortly, but with unaccustomed gentleness. He had only asked her when
she would like him to take her home; and she, a little surprised at the
idea of going home when to her the evening seemed only beginning, had answered--

<P>'Go home? I don't know! It's New Year's Eve!'

<P>'Ay! but yo'r mother 'll lie awake till yo' come home, Sylvie!'

<P>But Mrs Corney, having heard his question, broke in with all sorts of
upbraidings. 'Go home! Not see t' New Year in! Why, what should take 'em
home these six hours? Wasn't there a moon as clear as day? and did such
a time as this come often? And were they to break up the party before the
New Year came in? And was there not supper, with a spiced round of beef
that had been in pickle pretty nigh sin' Martinmas, and hams, and mince-pies,
and what not? And if they thought any evil of her master's going to bed,
or that by that early retirement he meant to imply that he did not bid
his friends welcome, why he would not stay up beyond eight o'clock for
King George upon his throne, as he'd tell them soon enough, if they'd only
step upstairs and ask him. Well; she knowed what it was to want a daughter
when she was ailing, so she'd say nought more, but hasten supper.

<P>And this idea now took possession of Mrs Corney's mind, for she would
not willingly allow one of her guests to leave before they had done justice
to her preparations; and, cutting her speech short, she hastily left Sylvia
and Philip together.

<P>His heart beat fast; his feeling towards her had never been so strong
or so distinct as since her refusal to kiss the 'candlestick.' He was on
the point of speaking, of saying something explicitly tender, when the
wooden trencher which the party were using at their play, came bowling
between him and Sylvia, and spun out its little period right betwixt them.
Every one was moving from chair to chair, and when the bustle was over
Sylvia was seated at some distance from him, and he left standing outside
the circle, as if he were not playing. In fact, Sylvia had unconsciously
taken his place as actor in the game while he remained spectator, and,
as it turned out, an auditor of a conversation not intended for his ears.
He was wedged against the wall, close to the great eight-day clock, with
its round moon-like smiling face forming a ludicrous contrast to his long,
sallow, grave countenance, which was pretty much at the same level above
the sanded floor. Before him sat Molly Brunton and one of her sisters,
their heads close together in too deep talk to attend to the progress of
the game. Philip's attention was caught by the words--

<P>'I'll lay any wager he kissed her when he ran off into t' parlour.'

<P>'She's so coy she'd niver let him,' replied Bessy Corney.

<P>'She couldn't help hersel'; and for all she looks so demure and prim
now' (and then both heads were turned in the direction of Sylvia), 'I'm
as sure as I'm born that Charley is not t' chap to lose his forfeit; and
yet yo' see he says nought more about it, and she's left off being 'feared
of him.'

<P>There was something in Sylvia's look, ay, and in Charley Kinraid's,
too, that shot conviction into Philip's mind. He watched them incessantly
during the interval before supper; they were intimate, and yet shy with
each other, in a manner that enraged while it bewildered Philip. What was
Charley saying to her in that whispered voice, as they passed each other?
Why did they linger near each other? Why did Sylvia look so dreamily happy,
so startled at every call of the game, as if recalled from some pleasant
idea? Why did Kinraid's eyes always seek her while hers were averted, or
downcast, and her cheeks all aflame? Philip's dark brow grew darker as
he gazed. He, too, started when Mrs Corney, close at his elbow, bade him
go in to supper along with some of the elder ones, who were not playing;
for the parlour was not large enough to hold all at once, even with the
squeezing and cramming, and sitting together on chairs, which was not at
all out of etiquette at Monkshaven. Philip was too reserved to express
his disappointment and annoyance at being thus arrested in his painful
watch over Sylvia; but he had no appetite for the good things set before
him, and found it hard work to smile a sickly smile when called upon by
Josiah Pratt for applause at some country joke. When supper was ended,
there was some little discussion between Mrs Corney and her son-in-law
as to whether the different individuals of the company should be called
upon for songs or stories, as was the wont at such convivial meetings.
Brunton had been helping his mother-in-law in urging people to eat, heaping
their plates over their shoulders with unexpected good things, filling
the glasses at the upper end of the table, and the mugs which supplied
the deficiency of glasses at the lower. And now, every one being satisfied,
not to say stuffed to repletion, the two who had been attending to their
wants stood still, hot and exhausted.

<P>'They're a'most stawed,' said Mrs Corney, with a pleased smile. 'It'll
be manners t' ask some one as knows how to sing.'

<P>'It may be manners for full men, but not for fasting,' replied Brunton.
'Folks in t' next room will be wanting their victual, and singing is allays
out o' tune to empty bellies.'

<P>'But there's them here as 'll take it ill if they're not asked. I heerd
Josiah Pratt a-clearing his throat not a minute ago, an' he thinks as much
on his singin' as a cock does on his crowin'.'

<P>'If one sings I'm afeard all on 'em will like to hear their own pipes.'

<P>But their dilemma was solved by Bessy Corney, who opened the door to
see if the hungry ones outside might not come in for their share of the
entertainment; and in they rushed, bright and riotous, scarcely giving
the first party time to rise from their seats ere they took their places.
One or two young men, released from all their previous shyness, helped
Mrs Corney and her daughters to carry off such dishes as were actually
empty. There was no time for changing or washing of plates; but then, as
Mrs Corney laughingly observed,--

<P>'We're a' on us friends, and some on us mayhap sweet-hearts; so no need
to be particular about plates. Them as gets clean ones is lucky; and them
as doesn't, and cannot put up wi' plates that has been used, mun go without.'

<P>It seemed to be Philip's luck this night to be pent up in places; for
again the space between the benches and the wall was filled up by the in-rush
before he had time to make his way out; and all he could do was to sit
quiet where he was. But between the busy heads and over-reaching arms he
could see Charley and Sylvia, sitting close together, talking and listening
more than eating. She was in a new strange state of happiness not to be
reasoned about or accounted for, but in a state of more exquisite feeling
than she had ever experienced before; when, suddenly lifting her eyes,
she caught Philip's face of extreme displeasure.

<P>'Oh,' said she, 'I must go. There's Philip looking at me so.'

<P>'Philip!' said Kinraid, with a sudden frown upon his face.

<P>'My cousin,' she replied, instinctively comprehending what had flashed
into his mind, and anxious to disclaim the suspicion of having a lover.
'Mother told him to see me home, and he's noan one for staying up late.'

<P>'But you needn't go. I'll see yo' home.'

<P>'Mother's but ailing,' said Sylvia, a little conscience-smitten at having
so entirely forgotten everything in the delight of the present, 'and I
said I wouldn't be late.'

<P>'And do you allays keep to your word?' asked he, with a tender meaning
in his tone.

<P>'Allays; leastways I think so,' replied she, blushing.

<P>'Then if I ask you not to forget me, and you give me your word, I may
be sure you'll keep it.'

<P>'It wasn't I as forgot you,' said Sylvia, so softly as not to be heard
by him.

<P>He tried to make her repeat what she had said, but she would not, and
he could only conjecture that it was something more tell-tale than she
liked to say again, and that alone was very charming to him.

<P>'I shall walk home with you,' said he, as Sylvia at last rose to depart,
warned by a further glimpse of Philip's angry face.

<P>'No!' said she, hastily, 'I can't do with yo';' for somehow she felt
the need of pacifying Philip, and knew in her heart that a third person
joining their <I>tete-a-tete</I> walk would only increase his displeasure.

<P>'Why not?' said Charley, sharply.

<P>'Oh! I don't know, only please don't!'

<P>By this time her cloak and hood were on, and she was slowly making her
way down her side of the room followed by Charley, and often interrupted
by indignant remonstrances against her departure, and the early breaking-up
of the party. Philip stood, hat in hand, in the doorway between the kitchen
and parlour, watching her so intently that he forgot to be civil, and drew
many a jest and gibe upon him for his absorption in his pretty cousin.

<P>When Sylvia reached him, he said,--

<P>'Yo're ready at last, are yo'?'

<P>'Yes,' she replied, in her little beseeching tone. 'Yo've not been wanting
to go long, han yo'? I ha' but just eaten my supper.'

<P>'Yo've been so full of talk, that's been the reason your supper lasted
so long. That fellow's none going wi' us?' said he sharply, as he saw Kinraid
rummaging for his cap in a heap of men's clothes, thrown into the back-kitchen.

<P>'No,' said Sylvia, in affright at Philip's fierce look and passionate
tone. 'I telled him not.'

<P>But at that moment the heavy outer door was opened by Daniel Robson
himself--bright, broad, and rosy, a jolly impersonation of Winter. His
large drover's coat was covered with snow-flakes, and through the black
frame of the doorway might be seen a white waste world of sweeping fell
and field, with the dark air filled with the pure down-fall. Robson stamped
his snow-laden feet and shook himself well, still standing on the mat,
and letting a cold frosty current of fresh air into the great warm kitchen.
He laughed at them all before he spoke.

<P>'It's a coud New Year as I'm lettin' in though it's noan t' New Year
yet. Yo'll a' be snowed up, as sure as my name s Dannel, if yo' stop for
twel' o'clock. Yo'd better mak' haste and go whoam. Why, Charley, my lad!
how beest ta? who'd ha' thought o' seeing thee i' these parts again! Nay,
missus, nay, t' New Year mun find its way int' t' house by itsel' for me;
for a ha' promised my oud woman to bring Sylvie whoam as quick as maybe;
she's lyin' awake and frettin' about t' snow and what not. Thank yo' kindly,
missus, but a'll tak' nought to eat; just a drop o' somethin' hot to keep
out coud, and wish yo' a' the compliments o' the season. Philip, my man,
yo'll not be sorry to be spared t' walk round by Haytersbank such a neet.
My missus were i' such a way about Sylvie that a thought a'd just step
off mysel', and have a peep at yo' a', and bring her some wraps. Yo'r sheep
will be a' folded, a reckon, Measter Pratt, for there'll niver be a nibble
o' grass to be seen this two month, accordin' to my readin'; and a've been
at sea long enough, and on land long enough t' know signs and wonders.
It's good stuff that, any way, and worth comin' for,' after he had gulped
down a tumblerful of half-and-half grog. 'Kinraid, if ta doesn't come and
see me afore thou'rt many days ouder, thee and me'll have words. Come,
Sylvie, what art ta about, keepin' me here? Here's Mistress Corney mixin'
me another jorum. Well, this time a'll give "T' married happy, and t' single
wed!"'

<P>Sylvia was all this while standing by her father quite ready for departure,
and not a little relieved by his appearance as her convoy home.

<P>'I'm ready to see Haytersbank to-night, master!' said Kinraid, with
easy freedom--a freedom which Philip envied, but could not have imitated,
although he was deeply disappointed at the loss of his walk with Sylvia,
when he had intended to exercise the power his aunt had delegated to him
of remonstrance if her behaviour had been light or thoughtless, and of
warning if he saw cause to disapprove of any of her associates.

<P>After the Robsons had left, a blank fell upon both Charley and Philip.
In a few minutes, however, the former, accustomed to prompt decision, resolved
that she and no other should be his wife. Accustomed to popularity among
women, and well versed in the incipient signs of their liking for him,
he anticipated no difficulty in winning her. Satisfied with the past, and
pleasantly hopeful about the future, he found it easy to turn his attention
to the next prettiest girl in the room, and to make the whole gathering
bright with his ready good temper and buoyant spirit.

<P>Mrs Corney had felt it her duty to press Philip to stay, now that, as
she said, he had no one but himself to see home, and the New Year so near
coming in. To any one else in the room she would have added the clinching
argument, 'A shall take it very unkind if yo' go now;' but somehow she
could not say this, for in truth Philip's look showed that he would be
but a wet blanket on the merriment of the party. So, with as much civility
as could be mustered up between them, he took leave. Shutting the door
behind him, he went out into the dreary night, and began his lonesome walk
back to Monkshaven. The cold sleet almost blinded him as the sea-wind drove
it straight in his face; it cut against him as it was blown with drifting
force. The roar of the wintry sea came borne on the breeze; there was more
light from the whitened ground than from the dark laden sky above. The
field-paths would have been a matter of perplexity, had it not been for
the well-known gaps in the dyke-side, which showed the whitened land beyond,
between the two dark stone walls. Yet he went clear and straight along
his way, having unconsciously left all guidance to the animal instinct
which co-exists with the human soul, and sometimes takes strange charge
of the human body, when all the nobler powers of the individual are absorbed
in acute suffering. At length he was in the lane, toiling up the hill,
from which, by day, Monkshaven might be seen. Now all features of the landscape
before him were lost in the darkness of night, against which the white
flakes came closer and nearer, thicker and faster. On a sudden, the bells
of Monkshaven church rang out a welcome to the New Year, 1796. From the
direction of the wind, it seemed as if the sound was flung with strength
and power right into Philip's face. He walked down the hill to its merry
sound--its merry sound, his heavy heart. As he entered the long High Street
of Monkshaven he could see the watching lights put out in parlour, chamber,
or kitchen. The New Year had come, and expectation was ended. Reality had
begun.

<P>He turned to the right, into the court where he lodged with Alice Rose.
There was a light still burning there, and cheerful voices were heard.
He opened the door; Alice, her daughter, and Coulson stood as if awaiting
him. Hester's wet cloak hung on a chair before the fire; she had her hood
on, for she and Coulson had been to the watch-night.

<P>The solemn excitement of the services had left its traces upon her countenance
and in her mind. There was a spiritual light in her usually shadowed eyes,
and a slight flush on her pale cheek. Merely personal and self-conscious
feelings were merged in a loving good-will to all her fellow-creatures.
Under the influence of this large charity, she forgot her habitual reserve,
and came forward as Philip entered to meet him with her New Year's wishes--wishes
that she had previously interchanged with the other two.

<P>'A happy New Year to you, Philip, and may God have you in his keeping
all the days thereof!'

<P>He took her hand, and shook it warmly in reply. The flush on her cheek
deepened as she withdrew it. Alice Rose said something curtly about the
lateness of the hour and her being much tired; and then she and her daughter
went upstairs to the front chamber, and Philip and Coulson to that which
they shared at the back of the house.
