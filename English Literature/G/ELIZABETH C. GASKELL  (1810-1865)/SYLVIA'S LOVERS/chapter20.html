Philip walked towards the Robsons' farm like a man in a dream, who has
everything around him according to his wish, and yet is conscious of a
secret mysterious inevitable drawback to his enjoyment. Hepburn did not
care to think would not realize what this drawback, which need not have
been mysterious in his case, was.

<P>The May evening was glorious in light and shadow. The crimson sun warmed
up the chilly northern air to a semblance of pleasant heat. The spring
sights and sounds were all about; the lambs were bleating out their gentle
weariness before they sank to rest by the side of their mothers; the linnets
were chirping in every bush of golden gorse that grew out of the stone
walls; the lark was singing her good-night in the cloudless sky, before
she dropped down to her nest in the tender green wheat; all spoke of brooding
peace but Philip's heart was not at peace.

<P>Yet he was going to proclaim his good fortune. His masters had that
day publicly announced that Coulson and he were to be their successors,
and he had now arrived at that longed-for point in his business, when he
had resolved to openly speak of his love to Sylvia, and might openly strive
to gain her love. But, alas the fulfilment of that wish of his had lagged
sadly behind. He was placed as far as he could, even in his most sanguine
moments, have hoped to be as regarded business, but Sylvia was as far from
his attainment as ever--nay, farther. Still the great obstacle was removed
in Kinraid's impressment. Philip took upon himself to decide that, with
such a man as the specksioneer, absence was equivalent to faithless forgetfulness.
He thought that he had just grounds for this decision in the account he
had heard of Kinraid's behaviour to Annie Coulson; to the other nameless
young girl, her successor in his fickle heart; in the ribald talk of the
sailors in the Newcastle public-house. It would be well for Sylvia if she
could forget as quickly; and, to promote this oblivion, the name of her
lover should never be brought up, either in praise or blame. And Philip
would be patient and enduring; all the time watching over her, and labouring
to win her reluctant love.

<P>There she was! He saw her as he stood at the top of the little hill-path
leading down to the Robsons' door. She was out of doors, in the garden,
which, at some distance from the house, sloped up the bank on the opposite
side of the gully; much too far off to be spoken to--not too far off to
be gazed at by eyes that caressed her every movement. How well Philip knew
that garden; placed long ago by some tenant of the farm on a southern slope;
wailed in with rough moorland stones; planted with berry-bushes for use,
and southernwood and sweet-briar for sweetness of smell. When the Robsons
had first come to Haytersbank, and Sylvia was scarcely more than a pretty
child, how well he remembered helping her with the arrangement of this
garden; laying out his few spare pence in hen-and-chicken daisies at one
time, in flower-seeds at another; again in a rose-tree in a pot. He knew
how his unaccustomed hands had laboured with the spade at forming a little
primitive bridge over the beck in the hollow before winter streams should
make it too deep for fording; how he had cut down branches of the mountain-ash
and covered them over, yet decked with their scarlet berries, with sods
of green turf, beyond which the brilliancy crept out; but now it was months
and years since he had been in that garden, which had lost its charm for
Sylvia, as she found the bleak sea-winds came up and blighted all endeavours
at cultivating more than the most useful things--pot-herbs, marigolds,
potatoes, onions, and such-like. Why did she tarry there now, standing
quite motionless up by the highest bit of wall, looking over the sea, with
her hand shading her eyes? Quite motionless; as if she were a stone statue.
He began to wish she would move--would look at him--but any way that she
would move, and not stand gazing thus over that great dreary sea.

<P>He went down the path with an impatient step, and entered the house-place.
There sat his aunt spinning, and apparently as well as ever. He could hear
his uncle talking to Kester in the neighbouring shippen; all was well in
the house-hold. Why was Sylvia standing in the garden in that strange quiet
way?

<P>'Why, lad! thou'rt a sight for sair een!' said his aunt, as she stood
up to welcome him back. 'An' when didst ta come, eh?--but thy uncle will
be glad to see thee, and to hear thee talk about yon pleughs; he's thought
a deal o' thy letters. I'll go call him in.'

<P>'Not yet,' said Philip, stopping her in her progress towards the door.
'He's busy talking to Kester. I'm in no haste to be gone. I can stay a
couple of hours. Sit down, and tell me how you are yoursel'--and how iverything
is. And I've a deal to tell you.'

<P>'To be sure--to be sure. To think thou's been in Lunnon sin' I saw thee!--well
to be sure! There's a vast o' coming and going i' this world. Thou'll mind
yon specksioneer lad, him as was cousin to t' Corneys--Charley Kinraid?'

<P>Mind him! As if he could forget him.

<P>'Well! he's dead and gone.'

<P>'Dead! Who told you? I don't understand,' said Philip, in strange bewilderment.
Could Kinraid have tried to escape after all, and been wounded, killed
in the attempt? If not, how should they know he was dead? Missing he might
be, though how this should be known was strange, as he was supposed to
be sailing to the Greenland seas. But dead! What did they mean? At Philip's
worst moment of hatred he had hardly dared to wish him dead.

<P>'Dunnot yo' mention it afore our Sylvie; we niver speak on him to her,
for she takes it a deal to heart, though I'm thinkin' it were a good thing
for her; for he'd got a hold of her--he had on Bessy Corney, too, as her
mother telled me;--not that I iver let on to them as Sylvia frets after
him, so keep a calm sough, my lad. It's a girl's fancy--just a kind o'
calf-love; let it go by; and it's well for her he's dead, though it's hard
to say so on a drowned man.'

<P>'Drowned!' said Philip. 'How do yo' know?' half hoping that the poor
drenched swollen body might have been found, and thus all questions and
dilemmas solved. Kinraid might have struggled overboard with ropes or handcuffs
on, and so have been drowned.

<P>'Eh, lad! there's no misdoubtin' it. He were thought a deal on by t'
captain o' t' <I>Urania</I>; and when he niver come back on t' day when
she ought for to have sailed, he sent to Kinraid's people at Cullercoats,
and they sent to Brunton's i' Newcassel, and they knew he'd been here.
T' captain put off sailing for two or three days, that he might ha' that
much law; but when he heard as Kinraid were not at Corneys', but had left
'em a'most on to a week, he went off to them northern seas wi' t' next
best specksioneer he could find. For there's no use speaking ill on t'
dead; an' though I couldn't abear his coming for iver about t' house, he
were a rare good specksioneer, as I've been told.'

<P>'But how do you know he was drowned?' said Philip, feeling guiltily
disappointed at his aunt's story.

<P>'Why, lad! I'm a'most ashamed to tell thee, I were sore put out mysel';
but Sylvia were so broken-hearted like I couldn't cast it up to her as
I should ha' liked: th' silly lass had gone and gi'en him a bit o' ribbon,
as many a one knowed, for it had been a vast noticed and admired that evenin'
at th' Corneys'--New Year's Eve I think it were--and t' poor vain peacock
had tied it on his hat, so that when t' tide----hist! there's Sylvie coming
in at t' back-door; never let on,' and in a forced made-up voice she inquired
aloud, for hitherto she had been speaking almost in a whisper,--

<P>'And didst ta see King George an Queen Charlotte?'

<P>Philip could not answer--did not hear. His soul had gone out to meet
Sylvia, who entered with quiet slowness quite unlike her former self. Her
face was wan and white; her gray eyes seemed larger, and full of dumb tearless
sorrow; she came up to Philip, as if his being there touched her with no
surprise, and gave him a gentle greeting as if he were a familiar indifferent
person whom she had seen but yesterday. Philip, who had recollected the
quarrel they had had, and about Kinraid too, the very last time they had
met, had expected some trace of this remembrance to linger in her looks
and speech to him. But there was no such sign; her great sorrow had wiped
away all anger, almost all memory. Her mother looked at her anxiously,
and then said in the same manner of forced cheerfulness which she had used
before,--

<P>'Here's Philip, lass, a' full o' Lunnon; call thy father in, an we'll
hear a' about t' new-fangled pleughs. It'll be rare an' nice a sitting
together again.'

<P>Sylvia, silent and docile, went out to the shippen to obey her mother's
wish. Bell Robson leant forward towards Philip, misinterpreting the expression
on his face, which was guilt as much as sympathy, and checked the possible
repentance which might have urged him on at that moment to tell all he
knew, by saying, 'Lad! it's a' for t' best. He were noane good enough for
her; and I misdoubt me he were only playin' wi' her as he'd done by others.
Let her a-be, let her a-be; she'll come round to be thankful.'

<P>Robson bustled in with loud welcome; all the louder and more talkative
because he, like his wife, assumed a cheerful manner before Sylvia. Yet
he, unlike his wife, had many a secret regret over Kinraid's fate. At first,
while merely the fact of his disappearance was known, Daniel Robson had
hit on the truth, and had stuck to his opinion that the cursed press-gang
were at the bottom of it. He had backed his words by many an oath, and
all the more because he had not a single reason to give that applied to
the present occasion. No one on the lonely coast had remarked any sign
of the presence of the men-of-war, or the tenders that accompanied them,
for the purpose of impressment on the King's ships. At Shields, and at
the mouth of the Tyne, where they lay in greedy wait, the owners of the
<I>Urania</I> had caused strict search to be made for their skilled and
protected specksioneer, but with no success. All this positive evidence
in contradiction to Daniel Robson's opinion only made him cling to it the
more; until the day when the hat was found on the shore with Kinraid's
name written out large and fair in the inside, and the tell-tale bit of
ribbon knotted in the band. Then Daniel, by a sudden revulsion, gave up
every hope; it never entered his mind that it could have fallen off by
any accident. No! now Kinraid was dead and drowned, and it was a bad job,
and the sooner it could be forgotten the better for all parties; and it
was well no one knew how far it had gone with Sylvia, especially now since
Bessy Corney was crying her eyes out as if he had been engaged to her.
So Daniel said nothing to his wife about the mischief that had gone on
in her absence, and never spoke to Sylvia about the affair; only he was
more than usually tender to her in his rough way, and thought, morning,
noon, and night, on what he could do to give her pleasure, and drive away
all recollection of her ill-starred love.

<P>To-night he would have her sit by him while Philip told his stories,
or heavily answered questions put to him. Sylvia sat on a stool by her
father's knee, holding one of his hands in both of hers; and presently
she laid down her head upon them, and Philip saw her sad eyes looking into
the flickering fire-light with long unwinking stare, showing that her thoughts
were far distant. He could hardly go on with his tales of what he had seen,
and what done, he was so full of pity for her. Yet, for all his pity, he
had now resolved never to soothe her with the knowledge of what he knew,
nor to deliver the message. sent by her false lover. He felt like a mother
withholding something injurious from the foolish wish of her plaining child.

<P>But he went away without breathing a word of his good fortune in business.
The telling of such kind of good fortune seemed out of place this night,
when the thought of death and the loss of friends seemed to brood over
the household, and cast its shadow there, obscuring for the time all worldly
things.

<P>And so the great piece of news came out in the ordinary course of gossip,
told by some Monkshaven friend to Robson the next market-day. For months
Philip had been looking forward to the sensation which the intelligence
would produce in the farm household, as a preliminary to laying his good
fortune at Sylvia's feet. And they heard of it, and he away, and all chance
of his making use of it in the manner he had intended vanished for the
present.

<P>Daniel was always curious after other people's affairs, and now was
more than ever bent on collecting scraps of news which might possibly interest
Sylvia, and rouse her out of the state of indifference as to everything
into which she had fallen. Perhaps he thought that he had not acted altogether
wisely in allowing her to engage herself to Kinraid, for he was a man apt
to judge by results; and moreover he had had so much reason to repent of
the encouragement which he had given to the lover whose untimely end had
so deeply affected his only child, that he was more unwilling than ever
that his wife should know of the length to which the affair had gone during
her absence. He even urged secrecy upon Sylvia as a personal favour; unwilling
to encounter the silent blame which he openly affected to despise.

<P>'We'll noane fret thy mother by lettin' on how oft he came and went.
She'll, maybe, be thinkin' he were for speakin' to thee, my poor lass;
an' it would put her out a deal, for she's a woman of a stern mind towards
matteremony. And she'll be noane so strong till summer-weather comes, and
I'd be loath to give her aught to worrit hersel' about. So thee and me
'll keep our own counsel.'

<P>'I wish mother had been here, then she'd ha' known all, without my telling
her.'

<P>'Cheer up, lass; it's better as it is. Thou'll get o'er it sooner for
havin' no one to let on to. A myself am noane going to speak on 't again.'

<P>No more he did; but there was a strange tenderness in his tones when
he spoke to her; a half-pathetic way of seeking after her, if by any chance
she was absent for a minute from the places where he expected to find her;
a consideration for her, about this time, in his way of bringing back trifling
presents, or small pieces of news that he thought might interest her, which
sank deep into her heart.

<P>'And what dun yo' think a' t' folks is talkin' on i' Monkshaven?' asked
he, almost before he had taken off his coat, on the day when he had heard
of Philip's promotion in the world. 'Why, missus, thy nephew, Philip Hepburn,
has got his name up i' gold letters four inch long o'er Fosters' door!
Him and Coulson has set up shop together, and Fosters is gone out!'

<P>'That's t' secret of his journey t' Lunnon,' said Bell, more gratified
than she chose to show.

<P>'Four inch long if they're theere at all! I heerd on it at t' Bay Horse
first; but I thought yo'd niver be satisfied 'bout I seed it wi' my own
eyes. They do say as Gregory Jones, t' plumber, got it done i' York, for
that nought else would satisfy old Jeremiah. It'll be a matter o' some
hundreds a year i' Philip's pocket.'

<P>'There'll be Fosters i' th' background, as one may say, to take t' biggest
share on t' profits,' said Bell.

<P>'Ay, ay, that's but as it should be, for I reckon they'll ha' to find
t' brass the first, my lass!' said he, turning to Sylvia. 'A'm fain to
tak' thee in to t' town next market-day, just for thee t' see 't. A'll
buy thee a bonny ribbon for thy hair out o' t' cousin's own shop.'

<P>Some thought of another ribbon which had once tied up her hair, and
afterwards been cut in twain, must have crossed Sylvia's mind, for she
answered, as if she shrank from her father's words,--

<P>'I cannot go, I'm noane wantin' a ribbon; I'm much obliged, father,
a' t' same.'

<P>Her mother read her heart clearly, and suffered with her, but never
spoke a word of sympathy. But she went on rather more quickly than she
would otherwise have done to question her husband as to all he knew about
this great rise of Philip's. Once 6r twice Sylvia joined in with languid
curiosity; but presently she became tired and went to bed. For a few moments
after she left, her parents sate silent. Then Daniel, in a tone as if he
were justifying his daughter, and comforting himself as well as his wife,
observed that it was almost on for nine; the evenings were light so long
now. Bell said nothing in reply, but gathered up her wool, and began to
arrange the things for night.

<P>By-and-by Daniel broke the silence by saying,--

<P>'A thowt at one time as Philip had a fancy for our Sylvie.'

<P>For a minute or two Bell did not speak. Then, with deeper insight into
her daughter's heart than her husband, in spite of his greater knowledge
of the events that had happened to affect it, she said,--

<P>'If thou's thinking on a match between 'em, it 'll be a long time afore
th' poor sad wench is fit t' think on another man as sweetheart.'

<P>'A said nought about sweethearts,' replied he, as if his wife had reproached
him in some way. 'Woman's allays so full o' sweethearts and matteremony.
A only said as a'd thowt once as Philip had a fancy for our lass, and a
think so still; and he'll be worth his two hunder a year afore long. But
a niver said nought about sweethearts.'
