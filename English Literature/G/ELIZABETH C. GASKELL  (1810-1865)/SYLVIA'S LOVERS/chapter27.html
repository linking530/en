Philip had money in the Fosters' bank, not so much as it might have been
if he had not had to pay for the furniture in his house. Much of this furniture
was old, and had belonged to the brothers Foster, and they had let Philip
have it at a very reasonable rate; but still the purchase of it had diminished
the amount of his savings. But on the sum which he possessed he drew largely--he
drew all--nay, he overdrew his account somewhat, to his former master's
dismay, although the kindness of their hearts overruled the harder arguments
of their heads.

<P>All was wanted to defend Daniel Robson at the approaching York assizes.
His wife had handed over to Philip all the money or money's worth she could
lay her hands upon. Daniel himself was not one to be much beforehand with
the world; but to Bell's thrifty imagination the round golden guineas,
tied up in the old stocking-foot against rent-day, seemed a mint of money
on which Philip might draw infinitely. As yet she did not comprehend the
extent of her husband's danger. Sylvia went about like one in a dream,
keeping back the hot tears that might interfere with the course of life
she had prescribed for herself in that terrible hour when she first learnt
all. Every penny of money either she or her mother could save went to Philip.
Kester's hoard, too, was placed in Hepburn's hands at Sylvia's earnest
entreaty; for Kester had no great opinion of Philip's judgment, and would
rather have taken his money straight himself to Mr Dawson, and begged him
to use it for his master's behoof.

<P>Indeed, if anything, the noiseless breach between Kester and Philip
had widened of late. It was seed-time, and Philip, in his great anxiety
for every possible interest that might affect Sylvia, and also as some
distraction from his extreme anxiety about her father, had taken to study
agriculture of an evening in some old books which he had borrowed--<I>The
Farmer's Complete Guide</I>, and such like; and from time to time he came
down upon the practical dogged Kester with directions gathered from the
theories in his books. Of course the two fell out, but without many words.
Kester persevered in his old ways, making light of Philip and his books
in manner and action, till at length Philip withdrew from the contest.
'Many a man may lead a horse to water, but there's few can make him drink,'
and Philip certainly was not one of those few. Kester, indeed, looked upon
him with jealous eyes on many accounts. He had favoured Charley Kinraid
as a lover of Sylvia's; and though he had no idea of the truth--though
he believed in the drowning of the specksioneer as much as any one--yet
the year which had elapsed since Kinraid's supposed death was but a very
short while to the middle-aged man, who forgot how slowly time passes with
the young; and he could often have scolded Sylvia, if the poor girl had
been a whit less heavy at heart than she was, for letting Philip come so
much about her--come, though it was on her father's business. For the darkness
of their common dread drew them together, occasionally to the comparative
exclusion of Bell and Kester, which the latter perceived and resented.
Kester even allowed himself to go so far as to wonder what Philip could
want with all the money, which to him seemed unaccountable; and once or
twice the ugly thought crossed his mind, that shops conducted by young
men were often not so profitable as when guided by older heads, and that
some of the coin poured into Philip's keeping might have another destination
than the defence of his master. Poor Philip! and he was spending all his
own, and more than all his own money, and no one ever knew it, as he had
bound down his friendly bankers to secrecy.

<P>Once only Kester ventured to speak to Sylvia on the subject of Philip.
She had followed her cousin to the field just in front of their house,
just outside the porch, to ask him some question she dared not put in her
mother's presence--(Bell, indeed, in her anxiety, usually absorbed all
the questions when Philip came)--and stood, after Philip had bid her good-by,
hardly thinking about him at all, but looking unconsciously after him as
he ascended the brow; and at the top he had turned to take a last glance
at the place his love inhabited, and, seeing her, he had waved his hat
in gratified farewell. She, meanwhile, was roused from far other thoughts
than of him, and of his now acknowledged love, by the motion against the
sky, and was turning back into the house when she heard Kester's low hoarse
call, and saw him standing at the shippen door.

<P>'Come hither, wench,' said he, indignantly; 'is this a time for courtin'?'

<P>'Courting?' said she, drawing up her head, and looking back at him with
proud defiance.

<P>'Ay, courtin'! what other mak' o' thing is't when thou's gazin' after
yon meddlesome chap, as if thou'd send thy eyes after him, and he making
marlocks back at thee? It's what we ca'ed courtin' i' my young days anyhow.
And it's noane a time for a wench to go courtin' when her feyther's i'
prison,' said he, with a consciousness as he uttered these last words that
he was cruel and unjust and going too far, yet carried on to say them by
his hot jealousy against Philip.

<P>Sylvia continued looking at him without speaking: she was too much offended
for expression.

<P>'Thou may glower an' thou may look, lass,' said he, 'but a'd thought
better on thee. It's like last week thy last sweetheart were drowned; but
thou's not one to waste time i' rememberin' them as is gone--if, indeed,
thou iver cared a button for yon Kinraid--if it wasn't a make-believe.'

<P>Her lips were contracted and drawn up, showing her small glittering
teeth, which were scarcely apart as she breathed out--

<P>'Thou thinks so, does thou, that I've forgetten <I>him</I>? Thou'd better
have a care o' thy tongue.'

<P>Then, as if fearful that her self-command might give way, she turned
into the house; and going through the kitchen like a blind person, she
went up to her now unused chamber, and threw herself, face downwards, flat
on her bed, almost smothering herself.

<P>Ever since Daniel's committal, the decay that had imperceptibly begun
in his wife's bodily and mental strength during her illness of the previous
winter, had been making quicker progress. She lost her reticence of speech,
and often talked to herself. She had not so much forethought as of old;
slight differences, it is true, but which, with some others of the same
description, gave foundation for the homely expression which some now applied
to Bell, 'She'll never be t' same woman again.

<P>This afternoon she had cried herself to sleep in her chair after Philip's
departure. She had not heard Sylvia's sweeping passage through the kitchen;
but half an hour afterwards she was startled up by Kester's abrupt entry.

<P>'Where's Sylvie?' asked he.

<P>'I don't know,' said Bell, looking scared, and as if she was ready to
cry. 'It's no news about him?' said she, standing up, and supporting herself
on the stick she was now accustomed to use.

<P>'Bless yo', no, dunnot be afeared, missus; it's only as a spoke hasty
to t' wench, an' a want t' tell her as a'm sorry, said Kester, advancing
into the kitchen, and looking round for Sylvia.

<P>'Sylvie, Sylvie!' shouted he; 'she mun be i' t' house.

<P>Sylvia came slowly down the stairs, and stood before him. Her face was
pale, her mouth set and determined; the light of her eyes veiled in gloom.
Kester shrank from her look, and even more from her silence.

<P>'A'm come to ax pardon,' said he, after a little pause.

<P>She was still silent.

<P>'A'm noane above axing pardon, though a'm fifty and more, and thee's
but a silly wench, as a've nursed i' my arms. A'll say before thy mother
as a ought niver to ha' used them words, and as how a'm sorry for 't.'

<P>'I don't understand it all,' said Bell, in a hurried and perplexed tone.
'What has Kester been saying, my lass?' she added, turning to Sylvia.

<P>Sylvia went a step or two nearer to her mother, and took hold of her
hand as if to quieten her; then facing once more round, she said deliberately
to Kester,--

<P>'If thou wasn't Kester, I'd niver forgive thee. Niver,' she added, with
bitterness, as the words he had used recurred to her mind. 'It's in me
to hate thee now, for saying what thou did; but thou're dear old Kester
after all, and I can't help mysel', I mun needs forgive thee,' and she
went towards him. He took her little head between his horny hands and kissed
it. She looked up with tears in her eyes, saying softly,--

<P>'Niver say things like them again. Niver speak on----'

<P>'A'll bite my tongue off first,' he interrupted.

<P>He kept his word.

<P>In all Philip's comings and goings to and from Haytersbank Farm at this
time, he never spoke again of his love. In look, words, manner, he was
like a thoughtful, tender brother; nothing more. He could be nothing more
in the presence of the great dread which loomed larger upon him after every
conversation with the lawyer.

<P>For Mr Donkin had been right in his prognostication. Government took
up the attack on the Rendezvous with a high and heavy hand. It was necessary
to assert authority which had been of late too often braved. An example
must be made, to strike dismay into those who opposed and defied the press-gang;
and all the minor authorities who held their powers from Government were
in a similar manner severe and relentless in the execution of their duty.
So the attorney, who went over to see the prisoner in York Castle, told
Philip. He added that Daniel still retained his pride in his achievement,
and could not be brought to understand the dangerous position in which
he was placed; that when pressed and questioned as to circumstances that
might possibly be used in his defence, he always wandered off to accounts
of previous outrages committed by the press-gang, or to passionate abuse
of the trick by which men had been lured from their homes on the night
in question to assist in putting out an imaginary fire, and then seized
and carried off. Some of this very natural indignation might possibly have
some effect on the jury; and this seemed the only ground of hope, and was
indeed a slight one, as the judge was likely to warn the jury against allowing
their natural sympathy in such a case to divert their minds from the real
question.

<P>Such was the substance of what Philip heard, and heard repeatedly, during
his many visits to Mr Dawson. And now the time of trial drew near; for
the York assizes opened on March the twelfth; not much above three weeks
since the offence was committed which took Daniel from his home and placed
him in peril of death.

<P>Philip was glad that, the extremity of his danger never having been
hinted to Bell, and travelling some forty miles being a most unusual exertion
at that time to persons of her class, the idea of going to see her husband
at York had never suggested itself to Bell's mind. Her increasing feebleness
made this seem a step only to be taken in case of the fatal extreme necessity;
such was the conclusion that both Sylvia and he had come to; and it was
the knowledge of this that made Sylvia strangle her own daily longing to
see her father. Not but that her hopes were stronger than her fears. Philip
never told her the causes for despondency; she was young, and she, like
her father, could not understand how fearful sometimes is the necessity
for prompt and severe punishment of rebellion against authority.

<P>Philip was to be in York during the time of the assizes; and it was
understood, almost without words, that if the terrible worst occurred,
the wife and daughter were to come to York as soon as might be. For this
end Philip silently made all the necessary arrangements before leaving
Monkshaven. The sympathy of all men was with him; it was too large an occasion
for Coulson to be anything but magnanimous. He urged Philip to take all
the time requisite; to leave all business cares to him. And as Philip went
about pale and sad, there was another cheek that grew paler still, another
eye that filled with quiet tears as his heaviness of heart became more
and more apparent. The day for opening the assizes came on. Philip was
in York Minster, watching the solemn antique procession in which the highest
authority in the county accompanies the judges to the House of the Lord,
to be there admonished as to the nature of their duties. As Philip listened
to the sermon with a strained and beating heart, his hopes rose higher
than his fears for the first time, and that evening he wrote his first
letter to Sylvia.

<P>'DEAR SYLVIA,

<P>'It will be longer first than I thought for. Mr Dawson says Tuesday
in next week. But keep up your heart. I have been hearing the sermon to-day
which is preached to the judges; and the clergyman said so much in it about
mercy and forgiveness, I think they cannot fail to be lenient this assize.
I have seen uncle, who looks but thin, but is in good heart: only he will
keep saying he would do it over again if he had the chance, which neither
Mr Dawson nor I think is wise in him, in especial as the gaoler is by and
hears every word as is said. He was very fain of hearing all about home;
and wants you to rear Daisy's calf, as he thinks she will prove a good
one. He bade me give his best love to you and my aunt, and his kind duty
to Kester.

<P>'Sylvia, will you try and forget how I used to scold you about your
writing and spelling, and just write me two or three lines. I think I would
rather have them badly spelt than not, because then I shall be sure they
are yours. And never mind about capitals; I was a fool to say such a deal
about them, for a man does just as well without them. A letter from you
would do a vast to keep me patient all these days till Tuesday. Direct--

<P>'Mr Philip Hepburn,

<DD>
'P.S. The sermon was grand. The text was Zechariab vii. 9, "Execute true
judgment and show mercy." God grant it may have put mercy into the judge's
heart as is to try my uncle.'</DD>

<DD>
Heavily the days passed over. On Sunday Bell and Sylvia went to church,
with a strange, half-superstitious feeling, as if they could propitiate
the Most High to order the events in their favour by paying Him the compliment
of attending to duties in their time of sorrow which they had too often
neglected in their prosperous days.</DD>

<DD>
But He 'who knoweth our frame, and remembereth that we are dust,' took
pity upon His children, and sent some of His blessed peace into their hearts,
else they could scarce have endured the agony of suspense of those next
hours. For as they came slowly and wearily home from church, Sylvia could
no longer bear her secret, but told her mother of the peril in which Daniel
stood. Cold as the March wind blew, they had not felt it, and had sate
down on a hedgebank for Bell to rest. And then Sylvia spoke, trembling
and sick for fear, yet utterly unable to keep silence any longer. Bell
heaved up her hands, and let them fall down on her knees before she replied.</DD>

<DD>
'The Lord is above us,' said she, solemnly. 'He has sent a fear o' this
into my heart afore now. I niver breathed it to thee, my lass----'</DD>

<DD>
'And I niver spoke on it to thee, mother, because----'</DD>

<DD>
Sylvia choked with crying, and laid her head on her mother's lap, feeling
that she was no longer the strong one, and the protector, but the protected.
Bell went on, stroking her head,</DD>

<DD>
'The Lord is like a tender nurse as weans a child to look on and to like
what it lothed once. He has sent me dreams as has prepared me for this,
if so be it comes to pass.</DD>

<DD>
'Philip is hopeful,' said Sylvia, raising her head and looking through
her tears at her mother.</DD>

<DD>
'Ay, he is. And I cannot tell, but I think it's not for nought as the Lord
has ta'en away all fear o' death out o' my heart. I think He means as Daniel
and me is to go hand-in-hand through the valley--like as we walked up to
our wedding in Crosthwaite Church. I could never guide th' house without
Daniel, and I should be feared he'd take a deal more nor is good for him
without me.'</DD>

<DD>
'But me, mother, thou's forgetting me,' moaned out Sylvia. 'Oh, mother,
mother, think on me!'</DD>

<DD>
'Nay, my lass, I'm noane forgetting yo'. I'd a sore heart a' last winter
a-thinking on thee, when that chap Kinraid were hanging about thee. I'll
noane speak ill on the dead, but I were uneasylike. But sin' Philip and
thee seem to ha' made it up----'</DD>

<DD>
Sylvia shivered, and opened her mouth to speak, but did not say a word.</DD>

<DD>
'And sin' the Lord has been comforting me, and talking to me many a time
when thou's thought I were asleep, things has seemed to redd theirselves
up, and if Daniel goes, I'm ready to follow. I could niver stand living
to hear folks say he'd been hung; it seems so unnatural and shameful.'</DD>

<DD>
'But, mother, he won't!--he shan't be hung!' said Sylvia, springing to
her feet. 'Philip says he won't.'</DD>

<DD>
Bell shook her head. They walked on, Sylvia both disheartened and almost
irritated at her mother's despondency. But before they went to bed at night
Bell said things which seemed as though the morning's feelings had been
but temporary, and as if she was referring every decision to the period
of her husband's return. 'When father comes home,' seemed a sort of burden
at the beginning or end of every sentence, and this reliance on his certain
coming back to them was almost as great a trial to Sylvia as the absence
of all hope had been in the morning. But that instinct told her that her
mother was becoming incapable of argument, she would have asked her why
her views were so essentially changed in so few hours. This inability of
reason in poor Bell made Sylvia feel very desolate.</DD>

<DD>
Monday passed over--how, neither of them knew, for neither spoke of what
was filling the thoughts of both. Before it was light on Tuesday morning,
Bell was astir.</DD>

<DD>
'It's very early, mother,' said weary, sleepy Sylvia, dreading returning
consciousness.</DD>

<DD>
'Ay, lass!' said Bell, in a brisk, cheerful tone; 'but he'll, maybe, be
home to-night, and I'se bound to have all things ready for him.'</DD>

<DD>
'Anyhow,' said Sylvia, sitting up in bed, 'he couldn't come home to-night.'</DD>

<DD>
'Tut, lass! thou doesn't know how quick a man comes home to wife and child.
I'll be a' ready at any rate.'</DD>

<DD>
She hurried about in a way which Sylvia wondered to see; till at length
she fancied that perhaps her mother did so to drive away thought. Every
place was cleaned; there was scarce time allowed for breakfast; till at
last, long before mid-day, all the work was done, and the two sat down
to their spinning-wheels. Sylvia's spirits sank lower and lower at each
speech of her mother's, from whose mind all fear seemed to have disappeared,
leaving only a strange restless kind of excitement.</DD>

<DD>
'It's time for t' potatoes,' said Bell, after her wool had snapped many
a time from her uneven tread.</DD>

<DD>
'Mother,' said Sylvia, 'it's but just gone ten!'</DD>

<DD>
'Put 'em on,' said Bell, without attending to the full meaning of her daughter's
words. 'It'll, maybe, hasten t' day on if we get dinner done betimes.'</DD>

<DD>
'But Kester is in t' Far Acre field, and he'll not be home till noon.'</DD>

<DD>
This seemed to settle matters for a while; but then Bell pushed her wheel
away, and began searching for her hood and cloak. Sylvia found them for
her, and then asked sadly--</DD>

<DD>
'What does ta want 'em for, mother?'</DD>

<DD>
'I'll go up t' brow and through t' field, and just have a look down t'
lane.'</DD>

<DD>
'I'll go wi' thee,' said Sylvia, feeling all the time the uselessness of
any looking for intelligence from York so early in the day. Very patiently
did she wait by her mother's side during the long half-hour which Bell
spent in gazing down the road for those who never came.</DD>

<DD>
When they got home Sylvia put the potatoes on to boil; but when dinner
was ready and the three were seated at the dresser; Bell pushed her plate
away from her, saying it was so long after dinner time that she was past
eating. Kester would have said something about its being only half-past
twelve, but Sylvia gave him a look beseeching silence, and he went on with
his dinner without a word, only brushing away the tears from his eyes with
the back of his hand from time to time.</DD>

<DD>
'A'll noane go far fra' home t' rest o' t' day,' said he, in a whisper
to Sylvia, as he went out.</DD>

<DD>
'Will this day niver come to an end?' cried Bell, plaintively.</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, mother! it'll come to an end some time, never fear. I've heerd say--</DD>

<DD>
"Be the day weary or be the day long,</DD>

<DD>
At length it ringeth to even-song."'</DD>

<DD>
'To even-song--to even-song,' repeated Bell. 'D'ye think now that even-song
means death, Sylvie?'</DD>

<DD>
'I cannot tell--I cannot bear it. Mother,' said Sylvia, in despair, 'I'll
make some clap-bread: that's a heavy job, and will while away t' afternoon.'</DD>

<DD>
'Ay, do!' replied the mother. 'He'll like it fresh--he'll like it fresh.'</DD>

<DD>
Murmuring and talking to herself, she fell into a doze, from which Sylvia
was careful not to disturb her.</DD>

<DD>
The days were now getting long, although as cold as ever; and at Haytersbank
Farm the light lingered, as there was no near horizon to bring on early
darkness. Sylvia had all ready for her mother's tea against she wakened;
but she slept on and on, the peaceful sleep of a child, and Sylvia did
not care to waken her. Just after the sun had set, she saw Kester outside
the window making signs to her to come out. She stole out on tip-toe by
the back-kitchen, the door of which was standing open. She almost ran against
Philip, who did not perceive her, as he was awaiting her coming the other
way round the corner of the house, and who turned upon her a face whose
import she read in an instant. 'Philip!' was all she said, and then she
fainted at his feet, coming down with a heavy bang on the round paving
stones of the yard.</DD>

<DD>
'Kester! Kester!' he cried, for she looked like one dead, and with all
his strength the wearied man could not lift her and carry her into the
house.</DD>

<DD>
With Kester's help she was borne into the back-kitchen, and Kester rushed
to the pump for some cold water to throw over her.</DD>

<DD>
While Philip, kneeling at her head, was partly supporting her in his arms,
and heedless of any sight or sound, the shadow of some one fell upon him.
He looked up and saw his aunt; the old dignified, sensible expression on
her face, exactly like her former self, composed, strong, and calm.</DD>

<DD>
'My lass,' said she, sitting down by Philip, and gently taking her out
of his arms into her own. 'Lass, bear up! we mun bear up, and be again
on our way to him, he'll be needing us now. Bear up, my lass! the Lord
will give us strength. We mun go to him; ay, time's precious; thou mun
cry thy cry at after!'</DD>

<DD>
Sylvia opened her dim eyes, and heard her mother's voice; the ideas came
slowly into her mind, and slowly she rose up, standing still, like one
who has been stunned, to regain her strength; and then, taking hold of
her mother's arm, she said, in a soft, strange voice--</DD>

<DD>
'Let's go. I'm ready.'</DD>
