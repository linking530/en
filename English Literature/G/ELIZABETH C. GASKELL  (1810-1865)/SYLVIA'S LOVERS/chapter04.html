<DD>
The coast on that part of the island to which this story refers is bordered
by rocks and cliffs. The inland country immediately adjacent to the coast
is level, flat, and bleak; it is only where the long stretch of dyke-enclosed
fields terminates abruptly in a sheer descent, and the stranger sees the
ocean creeping up the sands far below him, that he is aware on how great
an elevation he has been. Here and there, as I have said, a cleft in the
level land (thus running out into the sea in steep promontories) occurs--what
they would call a 'chine' in the Isle of Wight; but instead of the soft
south wind stealing up the woody ravine, as it does there, the eastern
breeze comes piping shrill and clear along these northern chasms, keeping
the trees that venture to grow on the sides down to the mere height of
scrubby brushwood. The descent to the shore through these 'bottoms' is
in most cases very abrupt, too much so for a cartway, or even a bridle-path;
but people can pass up and down without difficulty, by the help of a few
rude steps hewn here and there out of the rock.</DD>

<DD>
Sixty or seventy years ago (not to speak of much later times) the farmers
who owned or hired the land which lay directly on the summit of these cliffs
were smugglers to the extent of their power, only partially checked by
the coast-guard distributed, at pretty nearly equal interspaces of eight
miles, all along the north-eastern seaboard. Still sea-wrack was a good
manure, and there was no law against carrying it up in great osier baskets
for the purpose of tillage, and many a secret thing was lodged in hidden
crevices in the rocks till the farmer sent trusty people down to the shore
for a good supply of sand and seaweed for his land.</DD>

<DD>
One of the farms on the cliff had lately been taken by Sylvia's father.
He was a man who had roamed about a good deal--been sailor, smuggler, horse-dealer,
and farmer in turns; a sort of fellow possessed by a spirit of adventure
and love of change, which did him and his own family more harm than anybody
else. He was just the kind of man that all his neighbours found fault with,
and all his neighbours liked. Late in life (for such an imprudent man as
he was, one of a class who generally wed, trusting to chance and luck for
the provision for a family), farmer Robson married a woman whose only want
of practical wisdom consisted in taking him for a husband. She was Philip
Hepburn's aunt, and had had the charge of him until she married from her
widowed brother's house. He it was who had let her know when Haytersbank
Farm had been to let; esteeming it a likely piece of land for his uncle
to settle down upon, after a somewhat unprosperous career of horse-dealing.
The farmhouse lay in the shelter of a very slight green hollow scarcely
scooped out of the pasture field by which it was surrounded; the short
crisp turf came creeping up to the very door and windows, without any attempt
at a yard or garden, or any nearer enclosure of the buildings than the
stone dyke that formed the boundary of the field itself. The buildings
were long and low, in order to avoid the rough violence of the winds that
swept over that wild, bleak spot, both in winter and summer. It was well
for the inhabitants of that house that coal was extremely cheap; otherwise
a southerner might have imagined that they could never have survived the
cutting of the bitter gales that piped all round and seemed to seek out
every crevice for admission into the house.</DD>

<DD>
But the interior was warm enough when once you had mounted the long bleak
lane, full of round rough stones, enough to lame any horse unaccustomed
to such roads, and had crossed the field by the little dry, hard footpath,
which tacked about so as to keep from directly facing the prevailing wind.
Mrs Robson was a Cumberland woman, and as such, was a cleaner housewife
than the farmers' wives of that north-eastern coast, and was often shocked
at their ways, showing it more by her looks than by her words, for she
was not a great talker. This fastidiousness in such matters made her own
house extremely comfortable, but did not tend to render her popular among
her neighbours. Indeed, Bell Robson piqued herself on her housekeeping
generally, and once in-doors in the gray, bare stone house, there were
plenty of comforts to be had besides cleanliness and warmth. The great
rack of clap-bread hung overhead, and Bell Robson's preference of this
kind of oat-cake over the leavened and partly sour kind used in Yorkshire
was another source of her unpopularity. Flitches of bacon and 'hands' (<I>i.e.</I>,
shoulders of cured pork, the legs or hams being sold, as fetching a better
price) abounded; and for any visitor who could stay, neither cream nor
finest wheaten flour was wanting for 'turf cakes' and 'singing hinnies,'
with which it is the delight of the northern housewives to regale the honoured
guest, as he sips their high-priced tea, sweetened with dainty sugar.</DD>

<DD>
This night farmer Robson was fidgeting in and out of his house-door, climbing
the little eminence in the field, and coming down disappointed in a state
of fretful impatience. His quiet, taciturn wife was a little put out by
Sylvia's non-appearance too; but she showed her anxiety by being shorter
than usual in her replies to his perpetual wonders as to where the lass
could have been tarrying, and by knitting away with extra diligence.</DD>

<DD>
'I've a vast o' mind to go down to Monkshaven mysen, and see after t' child.
It's well on for seven.'</DD>

<DD>
'No, Dannel,' said his wife; 'thou'd best not. Thy leg has been paining
thee this week past, and thou'rt not up to such a walk. I'll rouse Kester,
and send him off, if thou think'st there's need on it.'</DD>

<DD>
'A'll noan ha' Kester roused. Who's to go, afield betimes after t' sheep
in t' morn, if he's ca'ed up to-neet? He'd miss t' lass, and find a public-house,
a reckon,' said Daniel, querulously.</DD>

<DD>
'I'm not afeard o' Kester,' replied Bell. 'He's a good one for knowing
folk i' th' dark. But if thou'd rather, I'll put on my hood and cloak and
just go to th' end o' th' lane, if thou'lt have an eye to th' milk, and
see as it does na' boil o'er, for she canna stomach it if it's bishopped
e'er so little.'</DD>

<DD>
Before Mrs Robson, however, had put away her knitting, voices were heard
at a good distance down the lane, but coming nearer every moment, and once
more Daniel climbed the little brow to look and to listen.</DD>

<DD>
'It's a' reet!' said he, hobbling quickly down. 'Niver fidget theesel'
wi' gettin' ready to go search for her. I'll tak' thee a bet it's Philip
Hepburn's voice, convoying her home, just as I said he would, an hour sin'.'</DD>

<DD>
Bell did not answer, as she might have done, that this probability of Philip's
bringing Sylvia home had been her own suggestion, set aside by her husband
as utterly ' unlikely. Another minute and the countenances of both parents
imperceptibly and unconsciously relaxed into pleasure as Sylvia came in.</DD>

<DD>
She looked very rosy from the walk, and the October air, which began to
be frosty in the evenings; there was a little cloud over her face at first,
but it was quickly dispersed as she met the loving eyes of home. Philip,
who followed her, had an excited, but not altogether pleased look about
him. He received a hearty greeting from Daniel, and a quiet one from his
aunt.</DD>

<DD>
'Tak' off thy pan o' milk, missus, and set on t' kettle. Milk may do for
wenches, but Philip and me is for a drop o' good Hollands and watter this
cold night. I'm a'most chilled to t' marrow wi' looking out for thee, lass,
for t' mother was in a peck of troubles about thy none coining home i'
t' dayleet, and I'd to keep hearkening out on t' browhead.'</DD>

<DD>
This was entirely untrue, and Bell knew it to be so; but her husband did
not. He had persuaded himself now, as he had done often before, that what
he had in reality done for his own pleasure or satisfaction, he had done
in order to gratify some one else.</DD>

<DD>
'The town was rough with a riot between the press-gang and the whaling
folk; and I thought I'd best see Sylvia home.'</DD>

<DD>
'Ay, ay, lad; always welcome, if it's only as an excuse for t' liquor.
But t' whalers, say'st ta? Why, is t' whalers in? There was none i' sight
yesterday, when I were down on t' shore. It's early days for 'em as yet.
And t' cursed old press-gang's agate again, doing its devil's work!'</DD>

<DD>
His face changed as he ended his speech, and showed a steady passion of
old hatred.</DD>

<DD>
'Ay, missus, yo' may look. I wunnot pick and choose my words, noather for
yo' nor for nobody, when I speak o' that daumed gang. I'm none ashamed
o' my words. They're true, and I'm ready to prove 'em. Where's my forefinger?
Ay! and as good a top-joint of a thumb as iver a man had? I wish I'd kept
'em i' sperits, as they done things at t' 'potticary's, just to show t'
lass what flesh and bone I made away wi' to get free. I ups wi' a hatchet
when I saw as I were fast a-board a man-o'-war standing out for sea--it
were in t' time o' the war wi' Amerikay, an' I could na stomach the thought
o' being murdered i' my own language--so I ups wi' a hatchet, and I says
to Bill Watson, says I, "Now, my lad, if thou'll do me a kindness, I'll
pay thee back, niver fear, and they'll be glad enough to get shut on us,
and send us to old England again. Just come down with a will." Now, missus,
why can't ye sit still and listen to me, 'stead o' pottering after pans
and what not?' said he, speaking crossly to his wife, who had heard the
story scores of times, and, it must be confessed, was making some noise
in preparing bread and milk for Sylvia's supper.</DD>

<DD>
Bell did not say a word in reply, but Sylvia tapped his shoulder with a
pretty little authoritative air.</DD>

<DD>
'It's for me, feyther. I'm just keen-set for my supper. Once let me get
quickly set down to it, and Philip there to his glass o' grog, and you'll
never have such listeners in your life, and mother's mind will be at ease
too.'</DD>

<DD>
'Eh! thou's a wilfu' wench,' said the proud father, giving her a great
slap on her back. 'Well! set thee down to thy victual, and be quiet wi'
thee, for I want to finish my tale to Philip. But, perhaps, I've telled
it yo' afore?' said he, turning round to question Hepburn.</DD>

<DD>
Hepburn could not say that he had not heard it, for he piqued himself on
his truthfulness. But instead of frankly and directly owning this, he tried
to frame a formal little speech, which would soothe Daniel's mortified
vanity; and, of course, it had the directly opposite effect. Daniel resented
being treated like a child, and yet turned his back on Philip with all
the wilfulness of one. Sylvia did not care for her cousin, but hated the
discomfort of having her father displeased; so she took up her tale of
adventure, and told her father and mother of her afternoon's proceedings.
Daniel pretended not to listen at first, and made ostentatious noises with
his spoon and glass; but by-and-by he got quite warm and excited about
the doings of the press-gang, and scolded both Philip and Sylvia for not
having learnt more particulars as to what was the termination of the riot.</DD>

<DD>
'I've been whaling mysel',' said he; 'and I've heerd tell as whalers wear
knives, and I'd ha' gi'en t' gang a taste o' my whittle, if I'd been cotched
up just as I'd set my foot a-shore.'</DD>

<DD>
'I don't know,' said Philip; 'we're at war wi' the French, and we shouldn't
like to be beaten; and yet if our numbers are not equal to theirs, we stand
a strong chance of it.'</DD>

<DD>
'Not a bit on't--so be d--d! ' said Daniel Robson, bringing down his fist
with such violence on the round deal table, that the glasses and earthenware
shook again. 'Yo'd not strike a child or a woman, for sure! yet it 'ud
be like it, if we did na' give the Frenchies some 'vantages--if we took
'em wi' equal numbers. It's not fair play, and that's one place where t'
shoe pinches. It's not fair play two ways. It's not fair play to cotch
up men as has no call for fightin' at another man's biddin' though they've
no objection to fight a bit on their own account and who are just landed,
all keen after bread i'stead o' biscuit, and flesh-meat i'stead o' junk,
and beds i'stead o' hammocks. (I make naught o' t' sentiment side, for
I were niver gi'en up to such carnal-mindedness and poesies.) It's noane
fair to cotch 'em up and put 'em in a stifling hole, all lined with metal
for fear they should whittle their way out, and send 'em off to sea for
years an' years to come. And again it's no fair play to t' French. Four
o' them is rightly matched wi' one o' us; and if we go an' fight 'em four
to four it's like as if yo' fell to beatin' Sylvie there, or little Billy
Croxton, as isn't breeched. And that's my mind. Missus, where's t' pipe?'</DD>

<DD>
Philip did not smoke, so took his turn at talking, a chance he seldom had
with Daniel, unless the latter had his pipe between his lips. So after
Daniel had filled it, and used Sylvia's little finger as a stopper to ram
down the tobacco--a habit of his to which she was so accustomed that she
laid her hand on the table by him, as naturally as she would have fetched
him his spittoon when he began to smoke--Philip arranged his arguments,
and began--</DD>

<DD>
'I'm for fair play wi' the French, as much as any man, as long as we can
be sure o' beating them; but, I say, make sure o' that, and then give them
ivery advantage. Now I reckon Government is not sure as yet, for i' the
papers it said as half th' ships i' th' Channel hadn't got their proper
complement o' men; and all as I say is, let Government judge a bit for
us; and if they say they're hampered for want o' men, why we must make
it up somehow. John and Jeremiah Foster pay in taxes, and Militiaman pays
in person; and if sailors cannot pay in taxes, and will not pay in person,
why they must be made to pay; and that's what th' press-gang is for, I
reckon. For my part, when I read o' the way those French chaps are going
on, I'm thankful to be governed by King George and a British Constitution.'</DD>

<DD>
Daniel took his pipe out of his mouth at this.</DD>

<DD>
'And when did I say a word again King George and the Constitution? I only
ax 'em to govern me as I judge best, and that's what I call representation.
When I gived my vote to Measter Cholmley to go up to t' Parliament House,
I as good as said, 'Now yo' go up theer, sir, and tell 'em what I, Dannel
Robson, think right, and what I, Dannel Robson, wish to have done.' Else
I'd be darned if I'd ha' gi'en my vote to him or any other man. And div
yo' think I want Seth Robson ( as is my own brother's son, and mate to
a collier) to be cotched up by a press-gang, and ten to one his wages all
unpaid? Div yo' think I'd send up Measter Cholmley to speak up for that
piece o' work? Not I.' He took up his pipe again, shook out the ashes,
puffed it into a spark, and shut his eyes, preparatory to listening.</DD>

<DD>
'But, asking pardon, laws is made for the good of the nation, not for your
good or mine.'</DD>

<DD>
Daniel could not stand this. He laid down his pipe, opened his eyes, stared
straight at Philip before speaking, in order to enforce his words, and
then said slowly--</DD>

<DD>
'Nation here! nation theere! I'm a man and yo're another, but nation's
nowheere. If Measter Cholmley talked to me I that fashion, he'd look long
for another vote frae me. I can make out King George, and Measter Pitt,
and yo' and me, but nation! nation, go hang!'</DD>

<DD>
Philip, who sometimes pursued an argument longer than was politic for himself,
especially when he felt sure of being on the conquering side, did not see
that Daniel Robson was passing out of the indifference of conscious wisdom
into that state of anger which ensues when a question becomes personal
in some unspoken way. Robson had contested this subject once or twice before,
and had the remembrance of former disputes to add to his present vehemence.
So it was well for the harmony of the evening that Bell and Sylvia returned
from the kitchen to sit in the house-place. They had been to wash up the
pans and basins used for supper; Sylvia had privately shown off her cloak,
and got over her mother's shake of the head at its colour with a coaxing
kiss, at the end of which her mother had adjusted her cap with a 'There!
there! ha' done wi' thee,' but had no more heart to show her disapprobation;
and now they came back to their usual occupations until it should please
their visitor to go; then they would rake the fire and be off to bed; for
neither Sylvia's spinning nor Bell's knitting was worth candle-light, and
morning hours are precious in a dairy.</DD>

<DD>
People speak of the way in which harp-playing sets off a graceful figure;
spinning is almost as becoming an employment. A woman stands at the great
wool-wheel, one arm extended, the other holding the thread, her head thrown
back to take in all the scope of her occupation; or if it is the lesser
spinning-wheel for flax--and it was this that Sylvia moved forwards to-night--the
pretty sound of the buzzing, whirring motion, the attitude of the spinner,
foot and hand alike engaged in the business--the bunch of gay coloured
ribbon that ties the bundle of flax on the rock--all make it into a picturesque
piece of domestic business that may rival harp-playing any day for the
amount of softness and grace which it calls out.</DD>

<DD>
Sylvia's cheeks were rather flushed by the warmth of the room after the
frosty air. The blue ribbon with which she had thought it necessary to
tie back her hair before putting on her hat to go to market had got rather
loose, and allowed her disarranged curls to stray in a manner which would
have annoyed her extremely, if she had been upstairs to look at herself
in the glass; but although they were not set in the exact fashion which
Sylvia esteemed as correct, they looked very pretty and luxuriant. Her
little foot, placed on the 'traddle,' was still encased in its smartly
buckled shoe--not slightly to her discomfort, as she was unaccustomed to
be shod in walking far; only as Philip had accompanied them home, neither
she nor Molly had liked to go barefoot. Her round mottled arm and ruddy
taper hand drew out the flax with nimble, agile motion, keeping time to
the movement of the wheel. All this Philip could see; the greater part
of her face was lost to him as she half averted it, with a shy dislike
to the way in which she knew from past experience that cousin Philip always
stared at her. And avert it as she would she heard with silent petulance
the harsh screech of Philip's chair as he heavily dragged it on the stone
floor, sitting on it all the while, and felt that he was moving round so
as to look at her as much as was in his power, without absolutely turning
his back on either her father or mother. She got herself ready for the
first opportunity of contradiction or opposition.</DD>

<DD>
'Well, wench! and has ta bought this grand new cloak?'</DD>

<DD>
'Yes, feyther. It's a scarlet one.'</DD>

<DD>
'Ay, ay! and what does mother say?'</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, mother's content,' said Sylvia, a little doubting in her heart, but
determined to defy Philip at all hazards.</DD>

<DD>
'Mother 'll put up with it if it does na spot would be nearer fact, I'm
thinking,' said Bell, quietly.</DD>

<DD>
'I wanted Sylvia to take the gray,' said Philip.</DD>

<DD>
'And I chose the red; it's so much gayer, and folk can see me the farther
off. Feyther likes to see me at first turn o' t' lane, don't yo', feyther?
and I'll niver turn out when it's boun' for to rain, so it shall niver
get a spot near it, mammy.'</DD>

<DD>
'I reckoned it were to wear i' bad weather,' said Bell. 'Leastways that
were the pretext for coaxing feyther out o' it.'</DD>

<DD>
She said it in a kindly tone, though the words became a prudent rather
than a fond mother. But Sylvia understood her better than Daniel did as
it appeared.</DD>

<DD>
'Hou'd thy tongue, mother. She niver spoke a pretext at all.'</DD>

<DD>
He did not rightly know what a 'pretext' was: Bell was a touch better educated
than her husband, but he did not acknowledge this, and made a particular
point of differing from her whenever she used a word beyond his comprehension.</DD>

<DD>
'She's a good lass at times; and if she liked to wear a yellow-orange cloak
she should have it. Here's Philip here, as stands up for laws and press-gangs,
I'll set him to find us a law again pleasing our lass; and she our only
one. Thou dostn't think on that, mother!</DD>

<DD>
Bell did think of that often; oftener than her husband, perhaps, for she
remembered every day, and many times a day, the little one that had been
born and had died while its father was away on some long voyage. But it
was not her way to make replies.</DD>

<DD>
Sylvia, who had more insight into her mother's heart than Daniel, broke
in with a new subject.</DD>

<DD>
'Oh! as for Philip, he's been preaching up laws all t' way home. I said
naught, but let Molly hold her own; or else I could ha' told a tale about
silks an' lace an' things.'</DD>

<DD>
Philip's face flushed. Not because of the smuggling; every one did that,
only it was considered polite to ignore it; but he was annoyed to perceive
how quickly his little cousin had discovered that his practice did not
agree with his preaching, and vexed, too, to see how delighted she was
to bring out the fact. He had some little idea, too, that his uncle might
make use of his practice as an argument against the preaching he had lately
been indulging in, in opposition to Daniel; but Daniel was too far gone
in his Hollands-and-water to do more than enunciate his own opinions, which
he did with hesitating and laboured distinctness in the following sentence:</DD>

<DD>
'What I think and say is this. Laws is made for to keep some folks fra'
harming others. Press-gangs and coast-guards harm me i' my business, and
keep me fra' getting what I want. Theerefore, what I think and say is this:
Measter Cholmley should put down press-gangs and coast-guards. If that
theere isn't reason I ax yo' to tell me what is? an' if Measter Cholmley
don't do what I ax him, he may go whistle for my vote, he may.'</DD>

<DD>
At this period in his conversation, Bell Robson interfered; not in the
least from any feeling of disgust or annoyance, or dread of what he might
say or do if he went on drinking, but simply as a matter of health. Sylvia,
too, was in no way annoyed; not only with her father, but with every man
whom she knew, excepting her cousin Philip, was it a matter of course to
drink till their ideas became confused. So she simply put her wheel aside,
as preparatory to going to bed, when her mother said, in a more decided
tone than that which she had used on any other occasion but this, and similar
ones-</DD>

<DD>
'Come, measter, you've had as much as is good for you.'</DD>

<DD>
'Let a' be! Let a' be,' said he, clutching at the bottle of spirits, but
perhaps rather more good-humoured with what he had drunk than he was before;
he jerked a little more into his glass before his wife carried it off,
and locked it up in the cupboard, putting the key in her pocket, and then
he said, winking at Philip--</DD>

<DD>
'Eh! my man. Niver gie a woman t' whip hand o'er yo'! Yo' seen what it
brings a man to; but for a' that I'll vote for Cholmley, an' d----t' press-gang!'</DD>

<DD>
He had to shout out the last after Philip, for Hepburn, really anxious
to please his aunt, and disliking drinking habits himself by constitution,
was already at the door, and setting out on his return home, thinking,
it must be confessed, far more of the character of Sylvia's shake of the
hand than of the parting words of either his uncle or aunt.</DD>
