The next morning shone bright and clear, if ever a March morning did. The
beguiling month was coming in like a lamb, with whatever storms it might
go raging out. It was long since Philip had tasted the freshness of the
early air on the shore, or in the country, as his employment at the shop
detained him in Monkshaven till the evening. And as he turned down the
quays (or staithes) on the north side of the river, towards the shore,
and met the fresh sea-breeze blowing right in his face, it was impossible
not to feel bright and elastic. With his knapsack slung over his shoulder,
he was prepared for a good stretch towards Hartlepool, whence a coach would
take him to Newcastle before night. For seven or eight miles the level
sands were as short and far more agreeable a road than the up and down
land-ways. Philip walked on pretty briskly, unconsciously enjoying the
sunny landscape before him; the crisp curling waves rushing almost up to
his feet, on his right hand, and then swishing back over the fine small
pebbles into the great swelling sea. To his left were the cliffs rising
one behind another, having deep gullies here and there between, with long
green slopes upward from the land, and then sudden falls of brown and red
soil or rock deepening to a yet greater richness of colour at their base
towards the blue ocean before him. The loud, monotonous murmur of the advancing
and receding waters lulled him into dreaminess; the sunny look of everything
tinged his day-dreams with hope. So he trudged merrily over the first mile
or so; not an obstacle to his measured pace on the hard, level pavement;
not a creature to be seen since he had left the little gathering of bare-legged
urchins dabbling in the sea-pools near Monkshaven. The cares of land were
shut out by the glorious barrier of rocks before him. There were some great
masses that had been detached by the action of the weather, and lay half
embedded in the sand, draperied over by the heavy pendent olive-green seaweed.
The waves were nearer at this point; the advancing sea came up with a mighty
distant length of roar; here and there the smooth swell was lashed by the
fret against unseen rocks into white breakers; but otherwise the waves
came up from the German Ocean upon that English shore with a long steady
roll that might have taken its first impetus far away, in the haunt of
the sea-serpent on the coast of 'Norroway over the foam.' The air was soft
as May; right overhead the sky was blue, but it deadened into gray near
the sea lines. Flocks of seagulls hovered about the edge of the waves,
slowly rising and turning their white under-plumage to glimmer in the sunlight
as Philip approached. The whole scene was so peaceful, so soothing, that
it dispelled the cares and fears (too well founded in fact) which had weighed
down on his heart during the dark hours of the past night.

<P>There was Haytersbank gully opening down its green entrance among the
warm brown bases of the cliffs. Below, in the sheltered brushwood, among
the last year's withered leaves, some primroses might be found. He half
thought of gathering Sylvia a posy of them, and rushing up to the farm
to make a little farewell peace-offering. But on looking at his watch,
he put all thoughts of such an action out of his head; it was above an
hour later than he had supposed, and he must make all haste on to Hartlepool.
Just as he was approaching this gully, a man came dashing down, and ran
out some way upon the sand with the very force of his descent; then he
turned to the left and took the direction of Hartlepool a hundred yards
or so in advance of Philip. He never stayed to look round him, but went
swiftly and steadily on his way. By the peculiar lurch in his walk--by
everything--Philip knew it was the specksioneer, Kinraid.

<P>Now the road up Haytersbank gully led to the farm, and nowhere else.
Still any one wishing to descend to the shore might do so by first going
up to the Robsons' house, and skirting the walls till they came to the
little slender path down to the shore. But by the farm, by the very house-door
they must of necessity pass. Philip slackened his pace, keeping under the
shadow of the rock. By-and-by Kinraid, walking on the sunlight open sands,
turned round and looked long and earnestly towards Haytersbank gully. Hepburn
paused when he paused, but as intently as he looked at some object above,
so intently did Hepburn look at him. No need to ascertain by sight towards
whom his looks, his thoughts were directed. He took off his hat and waved
it, touching one part of it as if with particular meaning. When he turned
away at last, Hepburn heaved a heavy sigh, and crept yet more into the
cold dank shadow of the cliffs. Each step was now a heavy task, his sad
heart tired and weary. After a while he climbed up a few feet, so as to
mingle his form yet more completely with the stones and rocks around. Stumbling
over the uneven and often jagged points, slipping on the sea-weed, plunging
into little pools of water left by the ebbing tide in some natural basins,
he yet kept his eyes fixed as if in fascination on Kinraid, and made his
way almost alongside of him. But the last hour had pinched Hepburn's features
into something of the wan haggardness they would wear when he should first
be lying still for ever.

<P>And now the two men were drawing near a creek, about eight miles from
Monkshaven. The creek was formed by a beck (or small stream) that came
flowing down from the moors, and took its way to the sea between the widening
rocks. The melting of the snows and running of the flooded water-springs
above made this beck in the early spring-time both deep and wide. Hepburn
knew that here they both must take a path leading inland to a narrow foot-bridge
about a quarter of a mile up the stream; indeed from this point, owing
to the jutting out of the rocks, the land path was the shortest; and this
way lay by the water-side at an angle right below the cliff to which Hepburn's
steps were leading him. He knew that on this long level field-path he might
easily be seen by any one following; nay, if he followed any one at a short
distance, for it was full of turnings; and he resolved, late as he was,
to sit down for a while till Kinraid was far enough in advance for him
to escape being seen. He came up to the last rock behind which he could
be concealed; seven or eight feet above the stream he stood, and looked
cautiously for the specksioneer. Up by the rushing stream he looked, then
right below.

<P>'It is God's providence,' he murmured. 'It is God's providence.'

<P>He crouched down where he had been standing and covered his face with
his hands. He tried to deafen as well as to blind himself, that he might
neither hear nor see anything of the coming event of which he, an inhabitant
of Monkshaven at that day, well understood the betokening signs.

<P>Kinraid had taken the larger angle of the sands before turning up towards
the bridge. He came along now nearing the rocks. By this time he was sufficiently
buoyant to whistle to himself. It steeled Philip's heart to what was coming
to hear his rival whistling, 'Weel may the keel row,' so soon after parting
with Sylvia.

<P>The instant Kinraid turned the corner of the cliff, the ambush was upon
him. Four man-of-war's men sprang on him and strove to pinion him.

<P>'In the King's name!' cried they, with rough, triumphant jeers.

<P>Their boat was moored not a dozen yards above; they were sent by the
tender of a frigate lying off Hartlepool for fresh water. The tender was
at anchor just beyond the jutting rocks in face.

<P>They knew that fishermen were in the habit of going to and from their
nets by the side of the creek; but such a prize as this active, strong,
and evidently superior sailor, was what they had not hoped for, and their
endeavours to secure him were in proportion to the value of the prize.

<P>Although taken by surprise, and attacked by so many, Kinraid did not
lose his wits. He wrenched himself free, crying out loud:

<P>'Avast, I'm a protected whaler. I claim my protection. I've my papers
to show, I'm bonded specksioneer to the <I>Urania</I> whaler, Donkin captain,
North Shields port.'

<P>As a protected whaler, the press-gang had, by the 17th section of Act
26 Geo. III. no legal right to seize him, unless he had failed to return
to his ship by the 10th March following the date of his bond. But of what
use were the papers he hastily dragged out of his breast; of what use were
laws in those days of slow intercourse with such as were powerful enough
to protect, and in the time of popular panic against a French invasion?

<P>'D--n your protection,' cried the leader of the press-gang; come and
serve his Majesty, that's better than catching whales.'

<P>'Is it though?' said the specksioneer, with a motion of his hand, which
the swift-eyed sailor opposed to him saw and interpreted rightly.

<P>'Thou wilt, wilt thou? Close with him, Jack; and ware the cutlass.'

<P>In a minute his cutlass was forced from him, and it became a hand-to-hand
struggle, of which, from the difference in numbers, it was not difficult
to foretell the result. Yet Kinraid made desperate efforts to free himself;
he wasted no breath in words, but fought, as the men said, 'like a very
devil.'

<P>Hepburn heard loud pants of breath, great thuds, the dull struggle of
limbs on the sand, the growling curses of those who thought to have managed
their affair more easily; the sudden cry of some one wounded, not Kinraid
he knew, Kinraid would have borne any pain in silence at such a moment;
another wrestling, swearing, infuriated strife, and then a strange silence.
Hepburn sickened at the heart; was then his rival dead? had he left this
bright world? lost his life--his love? For an instant Hepburn felt guilty
of his death; he said to himself he had never wished him dead, and yet
in the struggle he had kept aloof, and now it might be too late for ever.
Philip could not bear the suspense; he looked stealthily round the corner
of the rock behind which he had been hidden, and saw that they had overpowered
Kinraid, and, too exhausted to speak, were binding him hand and foot to
carry him to their boat.

<P>Kinraid lay as still as any hedgehog: he rolled when they pushed him;
he suffered himself to be dragged without any resistance, any motion; the
strong colour brought into his face while fighting was gone now, his countenance
was livid pale; his lips were tightly held together, as if it cost him
more effort to be passive, wooden, and stiff in their hands than it had
done to fight and struggle with all his might. His eyes seemed the only
part about him that showed cognizance of what was going on. They were watchful,
vivid, fierce as those of a wild cat brought to bay, seeking in its desperate
quickened brain for some mode of escape not yet visible, and in all probability
never to become visible to the hopeless creature in its supreme agony.

<P>Without a motion of his head, he was perceiving and taking in everything
while he lay bound at the bottom of the boat. A sailor sat by his side,
who had been hurt by a blow from him. The man held his head in his hand,
moaning; but every now and then he revenged himself by a kick at the prostrate
specksioneer, till even his comrades stopped their cursing and swearing
at their prisoner for the trouble he had given them, to cry shame on their
comrade. But Kinraid never spoke, nor shrank from the outstretched foot.

<P>One of his captors, with the successful insolence of victory, ventured
to jeer him on the supposed reason for his vehement and hopeless resistance.

<P>He might have said yet more insolent things; the kicks might have hit
harder; Kinraid did not hear or heed. His soul was beating itself against
the bars of inflexible circumstance reviewing in one terrible instant of
time what had been, what might have been, what was. Yet while these thoughts
thus stabbed him, he was still mechanically looking out for chances. He
moved his head a little, so as to turn towards Haytersbank, where Sylvia
must be quickly, if sadly, going about her simple daily work; and then
his quick eye caught Hepburn's face, blanched with excitement rather than
fear, watching eagerly from behind the rock, where he had sat breathless
during the affray and the impressment of his rival.

<P>'Come here, lad!' shouted the specksioneer as soon as he saw Philip,
heaving and writhing his body the while with so much vigour that the sailors
started away from the work they were engaged in about the boat, and held
him down once more, as if afraid he should break the strong rope that held
him like withes of green flax. But the bound man had no such notion in
his head. His mighty wish was to call Hepburn near that he might send some
message by him to Sylvia. 'Come here, Hepburn,' he cried again, falling
back this time so weak and exhausted that the man-of-war s men became sympathetic.

<P>'Come down, peeping Tom, and don't be afeared,' they called out.

<P>'I'm not afeared,' said Philip; 'I'm no sailor for yo' t' impress me:
nor have yo' any right to take that fellow; he's a Greenland specksioneer,
under protection, as I know and can testify.'

<P>'Yo' and yo'r testify go hang. Make haste, man and hear what this gem'man,
as was in a dirty blubbery whale-ship, and is now in his Majesty's service,
has got to say. I dare say, Jack,' went on the speaker, 'it's some message
to his sweet-heart, asking her to come for to serve on board ship along
with he, like Billy Taylor's young woman.'

<P>Philip was coming towards them slowly, not from want of activity, but
because he was undecided what he should be called upon to do or to say
by the man whom he hated and dreaded, yet whom just now he could not help
admiring.

<P>Kinraid groaned with impatience at seeing one, free to move with quick
decision, so slow and dilatory.

<P>'Come on then,' cried the sailors, 'or we'll take you too on board,
and run you up and down the main-mast a few times. Nothing like life aboard
ship for quickening a land-lubber.'

<P>'Yo'd better take him and leave me,' said Kinraid, grimly. 'I've been
taught my lesson; and seemingly he has his yet to learn.'

<P>'His Majesty isn't a schoolmaster to need scholars; but a jolly good
captain to need men,' replied the leader of the gang, eyeing Philip nevertheless,
and questioning within him-self how far, with only two other available
men, they durst venture on his capture as well as the specksioneer's. It
might be done, he thought, even though there was this powerful captive
aboard, and the boat to manage too; but, running his eye over Philip's
figure, he decided that the tall stooping fellow was never cut out for
a sailor, and that he should get small thanks if he captured him, to pay
him for the possible risk of losing the other. Or else the mere fact of
being a landsman was of as little consequence to the press-gang, as the
protecting papers which Kinraid had vainly showed.

<P>'Yon fellow wouldn't have been worth his grog this many a day, and be
d--d to you,' said he, catching Hepburn by the shoulder, and giving him
a push. Philip stumbled over something in this, his forced run. He looked
down; his foot had caught in Kinraid's hat, which had dropped off in the
previous struggle. In the band that went round the low crown, a ribbon
was knotted; a piece of. that same ribbon which Philip had chosen out,
with such tender hope, to give to Sylvia for the Corneys' party on New
Year's Eve. He knew every delicate thread that made up the briar-rose pattern;
and a spasm of hatred towards Kinraid contracted his heart. He had been
almost relenting into pity for the man captured before his eyes; now he
abhorred him.

<P>Kinraid did not speak for a minute or two. The sailors, who had begun
to take him into favour, were all agog with curiosity to hear the message
to his sweetheart, which they believed he was going to send. Hepburn's
perceptions, quickened with his vehement agitation of soul, were aware
of this feeling of theirs; and it increased his rage against Kinraid, who
had exposed the idea of Sylvia to be the subject of ribald whispers. But
the specksioneer cared little what others said or thought about the maiden,
whom he yet saw before his closed eyelids as she stood watching him, from
the Haytersbank gully, waving her hands, her handkerchief, all in one passion-ate
farewell.

<P>'What do yo' want wi' me?' asked Hepburn at last in a gloomy tone. If
he could have helped it, he would have kept silence till Kinraid spoke
first; but he could no longer endure the sailors' nudges, and winks, and
jests among themselves.

<P>'Tell Sylvia,' said Kinraid----

<P>'There's a smart name for a sweetheart,' exclaimed one of the men; but
Kinraid went straight on,--

<P>'What yo've seen; how I've been pressed by this cursed gang.'

<P>'Civil words, messmate, if you please. Sylvia can't abide cursing and
swearing, I'm sure. We're gentlemen serving his Majesty on board the <I>Alcestis</I>,
and this proper young fellow shall be helped on to more honour and glory
than he'd ever get bobbing for whales. Tell Sylvia this, with my love;
Jack Carter's love, if she's anxious about my name.'

<P>One of the sailors laughed at this rude humour; another bade Carter
hold his stupid tongue. Philip hated him in his heart. Kinraid hardly heard
him. He was growing faint with the heavy blows he had received, the stunning
fall he had met with, and the reaction from his dogged self-control at
first.

<P>Philip did not speak nor move.

<P>'Tell her,' continued Kinraid, rousing himself for another effort, 'what
yo've seen. Tell her I'll come back to her. Bid her not forget the great
oath we took together this morning; she's as much my wife as if we'd gone
to church;--I'll come back and marry her afore long.'

<P>Philip said something inarticulately.

<P>'Hurra!' cried Carter, 'and I'll be best man. Tell her, too that I'll
have an eye on her sweetheart, and keep him from running after other girls.'

<P>'Yo'll have yo'r hands full, then,' muttered Philip, his passion boiling
over at the thought of having been chosen out from among all men to convey
such a message as Kinraid's to Sylvia.

<P>'Make an end of yo'r d--d yarns, and be off,' said the man who had been
hurt by Kinraid, and who had sate apart and silent till now.

<P>Philip turned away; Kinraid raised himself and cried after him,--

<P>'Hepburn, Hepburn! tell her----' what he added Philip could not hear,
for the words were lost before they reached him in the outward noise of
the regular splash of the oars and the rush of the wind down the gully,
with which mingled the closer sound that filled his ears of his own hurrying
blood surging up into his brain. He was conscious that he had said something
in. reply to Kinraid's adjuration that he would deliver his message to
Sylvia, at the very time when Carter had stung him into fresh anger by
the allusion to the possibility of the specksioneer's 'running after other
girls,' for, for an instant, Hepburn had been touched by the contrast of
circumstances. Kinraid an hour or two ago,--Kinraid a banished man; for
in those days, an impressed sailor might linger out years on some foreign
station, far from those he loved, who all this time remained ignorant of
his cruel fate.

<P>But Hepburn began to wonder what he himself had said--how much of a
promise he had made to deliver those last passionate words of Kinraid's.
He could not recollect how much, how little he had said; he knew he had
spoken hoarsely and low almost at the same time as Carter had uttered his
loud joke. But he doubted if Kinraid had caught his words.

<P>And then the dread Inner Creature, who lurks in each of our hearts,
arose and said, 'It is as well: a promise given is a fetter to the giver.
But a promise is not given when it has not been received.'

<P>At a sudden impulse, he turned again towards the shore when he had crossed
the bridge, and almost ran towards the verge of the land. Then he threw
himself down on the soft fine turf that grew on the margin of the cliffs
overhanging the sea, and commanding an extent of view towards the north.
His face supported by his hands, he looked down upon the blue rippling
ocean, flashing here and there, into the sunlight in long, glittering lines.
The boat was still in the distance, making her swift silent way with long
regular bounds to the tender that lay in the offing.

<P>Hepburn felt insecure, as in a nightmare dream, so long as the boat
did not reach her immediate destination. His contracted eyes could see
four minute figures rowing with ceaseless motion, and a fifth sate at the
helm. But he knew there was a sixth, unseen, lying, bound and helpless,
at the bottom of the boat; and his fancy kept expecting this man to start
up and break his bonds, and overcome all the others, and return to the
shore free and triumphant.

<P>It was by no fault of Hepburn's that the boat sped well away; that she
was now alongside the tender, dancing on the waves; now emptied of her
crew; now hoisted up to her place. No fault of his! and yet it took him
some time before he could reason himself into the belief that his mad,
feverish wishes not an hour before--his wild prayer to be rid of his rival,
as he himself had scrambled onward over the rocks alongside of Kinraid's
path on the sands--had not compelled the event.

<P>'Anyhow,' thought he, as he rose up, my prayer is granted. God be thanked!'

<P>Once more he looked out towards the ship. She had spread her beautiful
great sails, and was standing out to sea in the glittering path of the
descending sun.

<P>He saw that he had been delayed on his road, and had lingered long.
He shook his stiffened limbs, shouldered his knapsack, and prepared to
walk on to Hartlepool as swiftly as he could.
