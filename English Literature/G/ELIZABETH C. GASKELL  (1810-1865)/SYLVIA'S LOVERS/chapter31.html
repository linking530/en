<DD>
The first step in Philip's declension happened in this way. Sylvia had
made rapid progress in her recovery; but now she seemed at a stationary
point of weakness; wakeful nights succeeding to languid days. Occasionally
she caught a little sleep in the afternoons, but she usually awoke startled
and feverish.</DD>

<DD>
One afternoon Philip had stolen upstairs to look at her and his child;
but the efforts he made at careful noiselessness made the door creak on
its hinges as he opened. it. The woman employed to nurse her had taken
the baby into another room that no sound might rouse her from her slumber;
and Philip would probably have been warned against entering the chamber
where his wife lay sleeping had he been perceived by the nurse. As it was,
he opened the door, made a noise, and Sylvia started up, her face all one
flush, her eyes wild and uncertain; she looked about her as if she did
not know where she was; pushed the hair off her hot forehead; all which
actions Philip saw, dismayed and regretful. But he kept still, hoping that
she would lie down and compose herself. Instead she stretched out her arms
imploringly, and said, in a voice full of yearning and tears,--</DD>

<DD>
'Oh! Charley! come to me--come to me!' and then as she more fully became
aware of the place where she was, her actual situation, she sank back and
feebly began to cry. Philip's heart boiled within him; any man's would
under the circumstances, but he had the sense of guilty concealment to
aggravate the intensity of his feelings. Her weak cry after another man,
too, irritated him, partly through his anxious love, which made him wise
to know how much physical harm she was doing herself. At this moment he
stirred, or unintentionally made some sound: she started up afresh, and
called out,--</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, who's theere? Do, for God's sake, tell me who yo' are!'</DD>

<DD>
'It's me,' said Philip, coming forwards, striving to keep down the miserable
complication of love and jealousy, and remorse and anger, that made his
heart beat so wildly, and almost took him out of himself. Indeed, he must
have been quite beside himself for the time, or he could never have gone
on to utter the unwise, cruel words he did. But she spoke first, in a distressed
and plaintive tone of voice.</DD>

<DD>
'Oh, Philip, I've been asleep, and yet I think I was awake! And I saw Charley
Kinraid as plain as iver I see thee now, and he wasn't drowned at all.
I'm sure he's alive somewheere; he were so clear and life-like. Oh! what
shall I do? what shall I do?'</DD>

<DD>
She wrung her hands in feverish distress. Urged by passionate feelings
of various kinds, and also by his desire to quench the agitation which
was doing her harm, Philip spoke, hardly knowing what he said.</DD>

<DD>
'Kinraid's dead, I tell yo', Sylvie! And what kind of a woman are yo' to
go dreaming of another man i' this way, and taking on so about him; when
yo're a wedded wife, with a child as yo've borne to another man?'</DD>

<DD>
In a moment he could have bitten out his tongue. She looked at him with
the mute reproach which some of us see (God help us!) in the eyes of the
dead, as they come before our sad memories in the night-season; looked
at him with such a solemn, searching look, never saying a word of reply
or defence. Then she lay down, motionless and silent. He had been instantly
stung with remorse for his speech; the words were not beyond his lips when
an agony had entered his heart; but her steady, dilated eyes had kept him
dumb and motionless as if by a spell.</DD>

<DD>
Now he rushed to the bed on which she lay, and half knelt, half threw himself
upon it, imploring her to forgive him; regardless for the time of any evil
consequences to her, it seemed as if he must have her pardon--her relenting--at
any price, even if they both died in the act of reconciliation. But she
lay speechless, and, as far as she could be, motionless, the bed trembling
under her with the quivering she could not still.</DD>

<DD>
Philip's wild tones caught the nurse's ears, and she entered full of the
dignified indignation of wisdom.</DD>

<DD>
'Are yo' for killing yo'r wife, measter?' she asked. 'She's noane so strong
as she can bear flytin' and scoldin', nor will she be for many a week to
come. Go down wi' ye, and leave her i' peace if yo're a man as can be called
a man!'</DD>

<DD>
Her anger was rising as she caught sight of Sylvia's averted face. It was
flushed crimson, her eyes full of intense emotion of some kind, her lips
compressed; but an involuntary twitching overmastering her resolute stillness
from time to time. Philip, who did not see the averted face, nor understand
the real danger in which he was placing his wife, felt as though he must
have one word, one responsive touch of the hand which lay passive in his,
which was not even drawn away from the kisses with which he covered it,
any more than if it had been an impassive stone. The nurse had fairly to
take him by the shoulders, and turn him out of the room.</DD>

<DD>
In half an hour the doctor had to be summoned. Of course, the nurse gave
him her version of the events of the afternoon, with much <I>animus</I>
against Philip; and the doctor thought it his duty to have some very serious
conversation with him.</DD>

<DD>
'I do assure you, Mr Hepburn, that, in the state your wife has been in
for some days, it was little less than madness on your part to speak to
her about anything that could give rise to strong emotion.'</DD>

<DD>
'It was madness, sir!' replied Philip, in a low, miserable tone of voice.
The doctor's heart was touched, in spite of the nurse's accusations against
the scolding husband. Yet the danger was now too serious for him to mince
matters.</DD>

<DD>
'I must tell you that I cannot answer for her life, unless the greatest
precautions are taken on your part, and unless the measures I shall use
have the effect I wish for in the next twenty-four hours. She is on the
verge of a brain fever. Any allusion to the subject which has been the
final cause of the state in which she now is must be most cautiously avoided,
even to a chance word which may bring it to her memory.</DD>

<DD>
And so on; but Philip seemed to hear only this: then he might not express
contrition, or sue for pardon, he must go on unforgiven through all this
stress of anxiety; and even if she recovered the doctor warned him of the
undesirableness of recurring to what had passed!</DD>

<DD>
Heavy miserable times of endurance and waiting have to be passed through
by all during the course of their lives; and Philip had had his share of
such seasons, when the heart, and the will, and the speech, and the limbs,
must be bound down with strong resolution to patience.</DD>

<DD>
For many days, nay, for weeks, he was forbidden to see Sylvia, as the very
sound of his footstep brought on a recurrence of the fever and convulsive
movement. Yet she seemed, from questions she feebly asked the nurse, to
have forgotten all that had happened on the day of her attack from the
time when she dropped off to sleep. But how much she remembered of after
occurrences no one could ascertain. She was quiet enough when, at length,
Philip was allowed to see her. But he was half jealous of his child, when
he watched how she could smile at it, while she never changed a muscle
of her face at all he could do or say.</DD>

<DD>
And of a piece with this extreme quietude and reserve was her behaviour
to him when at length she had fully recovered, and was able to go about
the house again. Philip thought many a time of the words she had used long
before--before their marriage. Ominous words they were.</DD>

<DD>
'It's not in me to forgive; I sometimes think it's not in me to forget.'</DD>

<DD>
Philip was tender even to humility in his conduct towards her. But nothing
stirred her from her fortress of reserve. And he knew she was so different;
he knew how loving, nay, passionate, was her nature--vehement, demonstrative--oh!
how could he stir her once more into expression, even if the first show
or speech she made was of anger? Then he tried being angry with her himself;
he was sometimes unjust to her consciously and. of a purpose, in order
to provoke her into defending herself, and appealing against his unkindness.
He only seemed to drive her love away still more.</DD>

<DD>
If any one had known all that was passing in that household, while yet
the story of it was not ended, nor, indeed, come to its crisis, their hearts
would have been sorry for the man who lingered long at the door of the
room in which his wife sate cooing and talking to her baby, and sometimes
laughing back to it, or who was soothing the querulousness of failing age
with every possible patience of love; sorry for the poor listener who was
hungering for the profusion of tenderness thus scattered on the senseless
air, yet only by stealth caught the echoes of what ought to have been his.</DD>

<DD>
It was so difficult to complain, too; impossible, in fact. Everything that
a wife could do from duty she did; but the love seemed to have fled, and,
in such cases, no reproaches or complaints can avail to bring it back.
So reason outsiders, and are convinced of the result before the experiment
is made. But Philip could not reason, or could not yield to reason; and
so he complained and reproached. She did not much answer him; but he thought
that her eyes expressed the old words,-</DD>

<DD>
'It's not in me to forgive; I sometimes think. it's not in me to forget.'</DD>

<DD>
However, it is an old story, an ascertained fact, that, even in the most
tender and stable masculine natures, at the supremest season of their lives,
there is room for other thoughts and passions than such as are connected
with love. Even with the most domestic and affectionate men, their emotions
seem to be kept in a cell distinct and away from their actual lives. Philip
had other thoughts and other occupations than those connected with his
wife during all this time.</DD>

<DD>
An uncle of his mother's, a Cumberland 'statesman,' of whose existence
he was barely conscious, died about this time, leaving to his unknown great-nephew
four or five hundred pounds, which put him at once in a different position
with regard to his business. Henceforward his ambition was roused,--such
humble ambition as befitted a shopkeeper in a country town sixty or seventy
years ago. To be respected by the men around him had always been an object
with him, and was, perhaps, becoming more so than ever now, as a sort of
refuge from his deep, sorrowful mortification in other directions. He was
greatly pleased at being made a sidesman; and, in preparation for the further
honour of being churchwarden, he went regularly twice a day to church on
Sundays. There was enough religious feeling in him to make him disguise
the worldly reason for such conduct from himself. He believed that. he
went because he thought it right to attend public worship in the parish
church whenever it was offered up; but it may be questioned of him, as
of many others, how far he would have been as regular in attendance in
a place where he was not known. With this, however, we have nothing to
do. The fact was that he went regularly to church, and he wished his wife
to accompany him to the pew, newly painted, with his name on the door,
where he sate in full sight of the clergyman and congregation.</DD>

<DD>
Sylvia had never been in the habit of such regular church-going, and she
felt it as a hardship, and slipped out of the duty as often as ever she
could. In her unmarried days, she and her parents had gone annually to
the mother-church of the parish in which Haytersbank was situated: on the
Monday succeeding the Sunday next after the Romish Saint's Day, to whom
the church was dedicated, there was a great feast or wake held, and, on
the Sunday, all the parishioners came to church from far and near. Frequently,
too, in the course of the year, Sylvia would accompany one or other of
her parents to Scarby Moorside afternoon service,--when the hay was got
in, and the corn not ready for cutting, or the cows were dry and there
was no afternoon milking. Many clergymen were languid in those days, and
did not too curiously inquire into the reasons which gave them such small
congregations in country parishes.</DD>

<DD>
Now she was married, this weekly church-going which Philip seemed to expect
from her, became a tie and a small hardship, which connected itself with
her life of respectability and prosperity. 'A crust of bread and liberty'
was much more accordant to Sylvia's nature than plenty of creature comforts
and many restraints. Another wish of Philip's, against which she said no
word, but constantly rebelled in thought and deed, was his desire that
the servant he had engaged during the time of her illness to take charge
of the baby, should always carry it whenever it was taken out for a walk.
Sylvia often felt, now she was strong, as if she would far rather have
been without the responsibility of having this nursemaid, of whom she was,
in reality, rather afraid. The good side of it was that it set her at liberty
to attend to her mother at times when she would have been otherwise occupied
with her baby; but Bell required very little from any one: she was easily
pleased, unexacting, and methodical even in her dotage; preserving the
quiet, undemonstrative habits of her earlier life now that the faculty
of reason, which had been at the basis of the formation of such habits,
was gone. She took great delight in watching the baby, and was pleased
to have it in her care for a short time; but she dozed so much that it
prevented her having any strong wish on the subject.</DD>

<DD>
So Sylvia contrived to get her baby as much as possible to herself, in
spite of the nursemaid; and, above all, she would carry it out, softly
cradled in her arms, warm pillowed on her breast, and bear it to the freedom
and solitude of the sea-shore on the west side of the town, where the cliffs
were not so high, and there was a good space of sand and shingle at all
low tides.</DD>

<DD>
Once here, she was as happy as she ever expected to be in this world. The
fresh sea-breeze restored something of the colour of former days to her
cheeks, the old buoyancy to her spirits; here she might talk her heart-full
of loving nonsense to her baby; here it was all her own; no father to share
in it, no nursemaid to dispute the wisdom of anything she did with it.
She sang to it, she tossed it; it crowed and it laughed back again, till
both were weary; and then she would sit down on a broken piece of rock,
and fail to gazing on the advancing waves catching the sunlight on their
crests, advancing, receding, for ever and for ever, as they had done all
her life long--as they did when she had walked with them that once by the
side of Kinraid; those cruel waves that, forgetful of the happy lovers'
talk by the side of their waters, had carried one away, and drowned him
deep till he was dead. Every time she sate down to look at the sea, this
process of thought was gone through up to this point; the next step would,
she knew, bring her to the question she dared not, must not ask. He was
dead; he must be dead; for was she not Philip's wife? Then came up the
recollection of Philip's speech, never forgotten, only buried out of sight:
'What kind of a woman are yo' to go on dreaming of another man, and yo'
a wedded wife?' She used to shudder as if cold steel had been plunged into
her warm, living body as she remembered these words; cruel words, harmlessly
provoked. They were too much associated with physical pains to be dwelt
upon; only their memory was always there. She paid for these happy rambles
with her baby by the depression which awaited her on her re-entrance into
the dark, confined house that was her home; its very fulness of comfort
was an oppression. Then, when her husband saw her pale and fatigued, he
was annoyed, and sometimes upbraided her for doing what was so unnecessary
as to load herself with her child. She knew full well it was not that that
caused her weariness. By-and-by, when he inquired and discovered that all
these walks were taken in one direction, out towards the sea, he grew jealous
of her love for the inanimate ocean. Was it connected in her mind with
the thought of Kinraid? Why did she so perseveringly, in wind or cold,
go out to the sea-shore; the western side, too, where, if she went but
far enough, she would come upon the mouth of the Haytersbank gully, the
point at which she had last seen Kinraid? Such fancies haunted Philip's
mind for hours after she had acknowledged the direction of her walks. But
he never said a word that could distinctly tell her he disliked her going
to the sea, otherwise she would have obeyed him in this, as in everything
else; for absolute obedience to her husband seemed to be her rule of life
at this period--obedience to him who would so gladly have obeyed her smallest
wish had she but expressed it! She never knew that Philip had any painful
association with the particular point on the sea-shore that she instinctively
avoided, both from a consciousness of wifely duty, and also because the
sight of it brought up so much sharp pain.</DD>

<DD>
Philip used to wonder if the dream that preceded her illness was the suggestive
cause that drew her so often to the shore. Her illness consequent upon
that dream had filled his mind, so that for many months he himself had
had no haunting vision of Kinraid to disturb his slumbers. But now the
old dream of Kinraid's actual presence by Philip's bedside began to return
with fearful vividness. Night after night it recurred; each time with some
new touch of reality, and close approach; till it was as if the fate that
overtakes all men were then, even then, knocking at his door.</DD>

<DD>
In his business Philip prospered. Men praised him because he did well to
himself. He had the perseverance, the capability for head-work and calculation,
the steadiness and general forethought which might have made him a great
merchant if he had lived in a large city. Without any effort of his own,
almost, too, without Coulson's being aware of it, Philip was now in the
position of superior partner; the one to suggest and arrange, while Coulson
only carried out the plans that emanated from Philip. The whole work of
life was suited to the man: he did not aspire to any different position,
only to the full development of the capabilities of that which he already
held. He had originated several fresh schemes with regard to the traffic
of the shop; and his old masters, with all their love of tried ways, and
distrust of everything new, had been candid enough to confess that their
successors' plans had resulted in success. 'Their successors.' Philip was
content with having the power when the exercise of it was required, and
never named his own important share in the new improvements. Possibly,
if he had, Coulson's vanity might have taken the alarm, and he might not
have been so acquiescent for the future. As it was, he forgot his own subordinate
share, and always used the imperial 'we,' 'we thought,' 'it struck us,'
&amp;c.</DD>
