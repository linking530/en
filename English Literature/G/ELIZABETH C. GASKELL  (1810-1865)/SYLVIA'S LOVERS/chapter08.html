<DD>
A fortnight had passed over and winter was advancing with rapid strides.
In bleak northern farmsteads there was much to be done before November
weather should make the roads too heavy for half-fed horses to pull carts
through. There was the turf, pared up on the distant moors, and left out
to dry, to be carried home and stacked; the brown fern was to be stored
up for winter bedding for the cattle; for straw was scarce and dear in
those parts; even for thatching, heather (or rather ling) was used. Then
there was meat to salt while it could be had; for, in default of turnips
and mangoldwurzel, there was a great slaughtering of barren cows as soon
as the summer herbage failed; and good housewives stored up their Christmas
piece of beef in pickle before Martinmas was over. Corn was to be ground
while yet it could be carried to the distant mill; the great racks for
oat-cake, that swung at the top of the kitchen, had to be filled. And last
of all came the pig-killing, when the second frost set in. For up in the
north there is an idea that the ice stored in the first frost will melt,
and the meat cured then taint; the first frost is good for nothing but
to be thrown away, as they express it.</DD>

<DD>
There came a breathing-time after this last event. The house had had its
last autumn cleaning, and was neat and bright from top to bottom, from
one end to another. The turf was led; the coal carted up from Monkshaven;
the wood stored; the corn ground; the pig killed, and the hams and head
and hands lying in salt. The butcher had been glad to take the best parts
of a pig of Dame Robson's careful feeding; but there was unusual plenty
in the Haytersbank pantry; and as Bell surveyed it one morning, she said
to her husband--</DD>

<DD>
'I wonder if yon poor sick chap at Moss Brow would fancy some o' my sausages.
They're something to crack on, for they are made fra' an old Cumberland
receipt, as is not known i' Yorkshire yet.'</DD>

<DD>
'Thou's allays so set upo' Cumberland ways!' said her husband, not displeased
with the suggestion, however. 'Still, when folk's sick they han their fancies,
and maybe Kinraid 'll be glad o' thy sausages. I ha' known sick folk tak'
t' eating snails.'</DD>

<DD>
This was not complimentary, perhaps. But Daniel went on to say that he
did not mind if he stepped over with the sausages himself, when it was
too late to do anything else. Sylvia longed to offer to accompany her father;
but, somehow, she did not like to propose it. Towards dusk she came to
her mother to ask for the key of the great bureau that stood in the house-place
as a state piece of furniture, although its use was to contain the family's
best wearing apparel, and stores of linen, such as might be supposed to
be more needed upstairs.</DD>

<DD>
'What for do yo' want my keys?' asked Bell.</DD>

<DD>
'Only just to get out one of t' damask napkins.'</DD>

<DD>
'The best napkins, as my mother span?'</DD>

<DD>
'Yes!' said Sylvia, her colour heightening. 'I thought as how it would
set off t' sausages.'</DD>

<DD>
'A good clean homespun cloth will serve them better,' said Bell, wondering
in her own mind what was come over the girl, to be thinking of setting
off sausages that were to be eaten, not to be looked at like a picture-book.
She might have wondered still more, if she had seen Sylvia steal round
to the little flower border she had persuaded Kester to make under the
wall at the sunny side of the house, and gather the two or three Michaelmas
daisies, and the one bud of the China rose, that, growing against the kitchen
chimney, had escaped the frost; and then, when her mother was not looking,
softly open the cloth inside of the. little basket that contained the sausages
and a fresh egg or two, and lay her autumn blossoms in one of the folds
of the towel.</DD>

<DD>
After Daniel, now pretty clear of his rheumatism, had had his afternoon
meal (tea was a Sunday treat), he prepared to set out on his walk to Moss
Brow; but as he was taking his stick he caught the look on Sylvia's face;
and unconsciously interpreted its dumb wistfulness.</DD>

<DD>
'Missus,' said he, 't' wench has nought more t' do, has she? She may as
well put on her cloak and step down wi' me, and see Molly a bit; she'll
be company like.'</DD>

<DD>
Bell considered.</DD>

<DD>
'There's t' yarn for thy stockings as is yet to spin; but she can go, for
I'll do a bit at 't mysel', and there's nought else agate.'</DD>

<DD>
'Put on thy things in a jiffy, then, and let's be off,' said Daniel.</DD>

<DD>
And Sylvia did not need another word. Down she came in a twinkling, dressed
in her new red cloak and hood, her face peeping out of the folds of the
latter, bright and blushing.</DD>

<DD>
'Thou should'st na' ha' put on thy new cloak for a night walk to Moss Brow,'
said Bell, shaking her head.</DD>

<DD>
'Shall I go take it off, and put on my shawl?' asked Sylvia, a little dolefully.</DD>

<DD>
'Na, na, come along! a'm noane goin' for t' wait o' women's chops and changes.
Come along; come, Lassie!' (this last to his dog).</DD>

<DD>
So Sylvia set off with a dancing heart and a dancing step, that had to
be restrained to the sober gait her father chose. The sky above was bright
and clear with the light of a thousand stars, the grass was crisping under
their feet with the coming hoar frost; and as they mounted to the higher
ground they could see the dark sea stretching away far below them. The
night was very still, though now and then crisp sounds in the distant air
sounded very near in the silence. Sylvia carried the basket, and looked
like little Red Riding Hood. Her father had nothing to say, and did not
care to make himself agreeable; but Sylvia enjoyed her own thoughts, and
any conversation would have been a disturbance to her. The long monotonous
roll of the distant waves, as the tide bore them in, the multitudinous
rush at last, and then the retreating rattle and trickle, as the baffled
waters fell back over the shingle that skirted the sands, and divided them
from the cliffs; her father's measured tread, and slow, even movement;
Lassie's pattering--all lulled Sylvia into a reverie, of which she could
not have given herself any definite account. But at length they arrived
at Moss Brow, and with a sudden sigh she quitted the subjects of her dreamy
meditations, and followed her father into the great house-place. It had
a more comfortable aspect by night than by day. The fire was always kept
up to a wasteful size, and the dancing blaze. and the partial light of
candles left much in shadow that was best ignored in such a disorderly
family. But there was always a warm welcome to friends, however roughly
given; and after the words of this were spoken, the next rose up equally
naturally in the mind of Mrs Corney.</DD>

<DD>
'And what will ye tak'? Eh! but t' measter 'll be fine and vexed at your
comin' when he's away. He's off to Horncastle t' sell some colts, and he'll
not be back till to-morrow's neet. But here's Charley Kinraid as we've
getten to nurse up a bit, and' t' lads 'll be back fra' Monkshaven in a
crack o' no time.'</DD>

<DD>
All this was addressed to Daniel, to whom she knew that none but masculine
company would be acceptable. Amongst uneducated people--whose range of
subjects and interest do not extend beyond their daily life--it is natural
that when the first blush and hurry of youth is over, there should be no
great pleasure in the conversation of the other sex. Men have plenty to
say to men, which in their estimation (gained from tradition and experience)
women cannot understand; and farmers of a much later date than the one
of which I am writing, would have contemptuously considered it as a loss
of time to talk to women; indeed, they were often more communicative to
the sheep-dog that accompanied them through all the day's work, and frequently
became a sort of dumb confidant. Farmer Robson's Lassie now lay down at
her master's feet, placed her nose between her paws, and watched with attentive
eyes the preparations going on for refreshments--preparations which, to
the disappointment of her canine heart, consisted entirely of tumblers
and sugar.</DD>

<DD>
'Where's t' wench?' said Robson, after he had shaken hands with Kinraid,
and spoken a few words to him and to Mrs Corney. 'She's getten' a basket
wi' sausages in 'em, as my missus has made, and she's a rare hand at sausages;
there's noane like her in a' t' three Ridings, I'll be bound!'</DD>

<DD>
For Daniel could praise his wife's powers in her absence, though he did
not often express himself in an appreciative manner when she was by to
hear. But Sylvia's quick sense caught up the manner in which Mrs Corney
would apply the way in which her mother's housewifery had been exalted,
and stepping forwards out of the shadow, she said,--</DD>

<DD>
'Mother thought, maybe, you hadn't killed a pig yet, and sausages is always
a bit savoury for any one who is na' well, and----'</DD>

<DD>
She might have gone on but that she caught Kinraid's eyes looking at her
with kindly admiration. She stopped speaking, and Mrs Corney took up the
word--</DD>

<DD>
'As for sausages, I ha' niver had a chance this year, else I stand again
any one for t' making of 'em. Yorkshire hams 's a vast thought on, and
I'll niver let another county woman say as she can make better sausages
nor me. But, as I'm saying, I'd niver a chance; for our pig, as I were
so fond on, and fed mysel', and as would ha' been fourteen stone by now
if he were an ounce, and as knew me as well as any Christian, and a pig,
as I may say, that I just idolized, went and took a fit a week after Michaelmas
Day, and died, as if it had been to spite me; and t' next is na' ready
for killing, nor wunnot be this six week. So I'm much beholden to your
missus, and so's Charley, I'm sure; though he's ta'en a turn to betterin'
sin' he came out here to be nursed.'</DD>

<DD>
'I'm a deal better,' said Kinraid; 'a'most ready for t' press-gang to give
chase to again.'</DD>

<DD>
'But folk say they're gone off this coast for one while,' added Daniel.</DD>

<DD>
'They're gone down towards Hull, as I've been told,' said Kinraid. 'But
they're a deep set, they'll be here before we know where we are, some of
these days.'</DD>

<DD>
'See thee here!' said Daniel, exhibiting his maimed hand; 'a reckon a served
'em out time o' t' Ameriky war.' And he began the story Sylvia knew so
well; for her father never made a new acquaintance but what he told him
of his self-mutilation to escape the press-gang. It had been done, as he
would himself have owned, to spite himself as well as them; for it had
obliged him to leave a sea-life, to which, in comparison, all life spent
on shore was worse than nothing for dulness. For Robson had never reached
that rank aboard ship which made his being unable to run up the rigging,
or to throw a harpoon, or to fire off a gun, of no great consequence; so
he had to be thankful that an opportune legacy enabled him to turn farmer,
a great degradation in his opinion. But his blood warmed, as he told the
specksioneer towards a sailor, and he pressed Kinraid to beguile the time
when he was compelled to be ashore, by coming over to see him at Haytersbank,
whenever he felt inclined.</DD>

<DD>
Sylvia, appearing to listen to Molly's confidences, was hearkening in reality
to all this conversation between her father and the specksioneer; and at
this invitation she became especially attentive.</DD>

<DD>
Kinraid replied,--</DD>

<DD>
'I'm much obliged to ye, I'm sure; maybe I can come andspend an ev'ning
wi' you; but as soon as I'm got round a bit, I must go see my own people
as live at Cullercoats near Newcastle-upo'-Tyne.'</DD>

<DD>
'Well, well!' said Daniel, rising to take leave, with unusual prudence
as to the amount of his drink. 'Thou'lt see, thou'lt see! I shall be main
glad to see thee; if thou'lt come. But I've na' lads to keep thee company,
only one sprig of a wench. Sylvia, come here, an let's show thee to this
young fellow!'</DD>

<DD>
Sylvia came forwards, ruddy as any rose, and in a moment Kinraid recognized
her as the pretty little girl he had seen crying so bitterly over Darley's
grave. He rose up out of true sailor's gallantry, as she shyly approached
and stood by her father's side, scarcely daring to lift her great soft
eyes, to have one fair gaze at his face. He had to support himself by one
hand rested on the dresser, but she saw he was looking far better--younger,
less haggard--than he had seemed to her before. His face was short and
expressive; his complexion had been weatherbeaten and bronzed, though now
he looked so pale; his eyes and hair were dark,--the former quick, deep-set,
and penetrating; the latter curly, and almost in ringlets. His teeth gleamed
white as he smiled at her, a pleasant friendly smile of recognition; but
she only blushed the deeper, and hung her head.</DD>

<DD>
'I'll come, sir, and be thankful. I daresay a turn'll do me good, if the
weather holds up, an' th' frost keeps on.'</DD>

<DD>
'That's right, my lad,' said Robson, shaking him by the hand, and then
Kinraid's hand was held out to Sylvia, and she could not avoid the same
friendly action.</DD>

<DD>
Molly Corney followed her to the door, and when they were fairly outside,
she held Sylvia back for an instant to say,--</DD>

<DD>
'Is na' he a fine likely man? I'm so glad as yo've seen him, for he's to
be off next week to Newcastle and that neighbourhood.'</DD>

<DD>
'But he said he'd come to us some night?' asked Sylvia, half in a fright.</DD>

<DD>
'Ay, I'll see as he does; never fear. For I should like yo' for to know
him a bit. He's a rare talker. I'll mind him o' coming to yo'.'</DD>

<DD>
Somehow, Sylvia felt as if this repeated promise of reminding Kinraid of
his promise to come and see her father took away part of the pleasure she
had anticipated from his visit. Yet what could be more natural than that
Molly Corney should wish her friend to be acquainted with the man whom
Sylvia believed to be all but Molly's engaged lover?</DD>

<DD>
Pondering these thoughts, the walk home was as silent as that going to
Moss Brow had been. The only change seemed to be that now they faced the
brilliant northern lights flashing up the sky, and that either this appearance
or some of the whaling narrations of Kinraid had stirred up Daniel Robson's
recollections of a sea ditty, which he kept singing to himself in a low,
unmusical voice, the burden of which was, 'for I loves the tossin' say!'
Bell met them at the door.</DD>

<DD>
'Well, and here ye are at home again! and Philip has been, Sylvie, to give
thee thy ciphering lesson; and he stayed awhile, thinking thou'd be coming
back.'</DD>

<DD>
'I'm very sorry,' said Sylvia, more out of deference to her mother's tone
of annoyance, than because she herself cared either for her lesson or her
cousin's disappointment.</DD>

<DD>
'He'll come again to-morrow night, he says. But thou must take care, and
mind the nights he says he'll come, for it's a long way to come for nought.'</DD>

<DD>
Sylvia might have repeated her 'I'm very sorry' at this announcement of
Philip's intentions; but she restrained her-self, inwardly and fervently
hoping that Molly would not urge the fulfilment of the specksioneer's promise
for to-morrow night, for Philip's being there would spoil all; and besides,
if she sate at the dresser at her lesson, and Kinraid at the table with
her father, he might hear all, and find out what a dunce she was.</DD>

<DD>
She need not have been afraid. With the next night Hepburn came; and Kinraid
did not. After a few words to her mother, Philip produced the candles he
had promised, and some books and a quill or two.</DD>

<DD>
'What for hast thou brought candles?' asked Bell, in a half-affronted tone.</DD>

<DD>
Hepburn smiled.</DD>

<DD>
'Sylvia thought it would take a deal of candle-light, and was for making
it into a reason not to learn. I should ha' used t' candles if I'd stayed
at home; so I just brought them wi' me.'</DD>

<DD>
'Then thou may'st just take them back again,' said Bell, shortly, blowing
out that which he had lighted, and placing one of her own on the dresser
instead.</DD>

<DD>
Sylvia caught her mother's look of displeasure, and it made her docile
for the evening, although she owed her cousin a grudge for her enforced
good behaviour.</DD>

<DD>
'Now, Sylvia, here's a copy-book wi' t' Tower o' London on it, and we'll
fill it wi' as pretty writing as any in t' North Riding.'</DD>

<DD>
Sylvia sate quite still, unenlivened by this prospect.</DD>

<DD>
'Here's a pen as 'll nearly write of itsel',' continued Philip, still trying
to coax her out her sullenness of manner.</DD>

<DD>
Then he arranged her in the right position.</DD>

<DD>
'Don't lay your head down on your left arm, you'll ne'er see to write straight.'</DD>

<DD>
The attitude was changed, but not a word was spoken.Philip began to grow
angry at such determined dumbness.</DD>

<DD>
'Are you tired?' asked he, with a strange mixture of crossness and tenderness.</DD>

<DD>
'Yes, very,' was her reply.</DD>

<DD>
'But thou ought'st not to be tired,' said Bell, who had not yet got over
the offence to her hospitality; who, moreover, liked her nephew, and had,
to boot, a great respect for the learning she had never acquired.</DD>

<DD>
'Mother!' said Sylvia, bursting out, 'what's the use on my writing "Abednego,"
"Abednego," "Abednego," all down a page? If I could see t' use on 't, I'd
ha' axed father to send me t' school; but I'm none wanting to have learning.'</DD>

<DD>
'It's a fine thing, tho', is learning. My mother and my grandmother had
it: but th' family came down i' the world, and Philip's mother and me,
we had none of it; but I ha' set my heart on thy having it, child.'</DD>

<DD>
'My fingers is stiff,' pleaded Sylvia, holding up her little hand and shaking
it.</DD>

<DD>
'Let us take a turn at spelling, then,' said Philip.</DD>

<DD>
'What's t' use on't?' asked captious Sylvia.</DD>

<DD>
'Why, it helps one i' reading an' writing.'</DD>

<DD>
'And what does reading and writing do for one?'</DD>

<DD>
Her mother gave her another of the severe looks that, quiet woman as she
was, she could occasionally bestow upon the refractory, and Sylvia took
her book and glanced down the column Philip pointed out to her; but, as
she justly considered, one man might point out the task, but twenty could
not make her learn it, if she did not choose; and she sat herself down
on the edge of the dresser, and idly gazed into the fire. But her mother
came round to look for something in the drawers of the dresser, and as
she passed her daughter she said in a low voice--</DD>

<DD>
'Sylvie, be a good lass. I set a deal o' store by learning, and father
'ud never send thee to school, as has stuck by me sore.'</DD>

<DD>
If Philip, sitting with his back to them, heard these words he was discreet
enough not to show that he heard. And he had his reward; for in a very
short time, Sylvia stood before him with her book in her hand, prepared
to say her spelling. At which he also stood up by instinct, and listened
to her slow succeeding letters; helping her out, when she looked up at
him with a sweet childlike perplexity in her face: for a dunce as to book-learning
poor Sylvia was and was likely to remain; and, in spite of his assumed
office of schoolmaster, Philip Hepburn could almost have echoed the words
of the lover of Jess MacFarlane--</DD>

<DD>
I sent my love a letter,</DD>

<DD>
But, alas! she canna read, And I lo'e her a' the better.</DD>

<DD>
Still he knew his aunt's strong wish on the subject, and it was very delightful
to stand in the relation of teacher to so dear and pretty, if so wilful,
a pupil.</DD>

<DD>
Perhaps it was not very flattering to notice Sylvia's great joy when her
lessons were over, sadly shortened as they were by Philip's desire not
to be too hard upon her. Sylvia danced round to her mother, bent her head
back, and kissed her face, and then said defyingly to Philip,--</DD>

<DD>
'If iver I write thee a letter it shall just be full of nothing but "Abednego!
Abednego! Abednego!"'</DD>

<DD>
But at this moment her father came in from a distant expedition on the
moors with Kester to look after the sheep he had pasturing there before
the winter set fairly in. He was tired, and so was Lassie, and so, too,
was Kester, who, lifting his heavy legs one after the other, and smoothing
down his hair, followed his master into the house-place, and seating himself
on a bench at the farther end of the dresser, patiently awaited the supper
of porridge and milk which he shared with his master. Sylvia, meanwhile,
coaxed Lassie poor foot-sore dog--to her side, and gave her some food,
which the creature was almost too tired to eat. Philip made as though he
would be going, but Daniel motioned to him to be quiet.</DD>

<DD>
'Sit thee down, lad. As soon as I've had my victual, I want t' hear a bit
o' news.'</DD>

<DD>
Sylvia took her sewing and sat at the little round table by her mother,
sharing the light of the scanty dip-candle. No one spoke. Every one was
absorbed in what they were doing. What Philip was doing was, gazing at
Sylvia--learning her face off by heart.</DD>

<DD>
When every scrap of porridge was cleared out of the mighty bowl, Kester
yawned, and wishing good-night, withdrew to his loft over the cow-house.
Then Philip pulled out the weekly York paper, and began to read the latest
accounts of the war then raging. This was giving Daniel one of his greatest
pleasures; for though he could read pretty well, yet the double effort
of reading and understanding what he read was almost too much for him.
He could read, or he could understand what was read aloud to him; reading
was no pleasure, but listening was.</DD>

<DD>
Besides, he had a true John Bullish interest in the war, without very well
knowing what the English were fighting for. But in those days, so long
as they fought the French for any cause, or for no cause at all, every
true patriot was satisfied. Sylvia and her mother did not care for any
such far-extended interest; a little bit of York news, the stealing of
a few apples out of a Scarborough garden that they knew, was of far more
interest to them than all the battles of Nelson and the North.</DD>

<DD>
Philip read in a high-pitched and unnatural tone of voice, which deprived
the words of their reality; for even familiar expressions can become unfamiliar
and convey no ideas, if the utterance is forced or affected. Philip was
somewhat of a pedant; yet there was a simplicity in his pedantry not always
to be met with in those who are self-taught, and which might have interested
any one who cared to know with what labour and difficulty he had acquired
the knowledge which now he prized so highly; reading out Latin quotations
as easily as if they were English, and taking a pleasure in rolling polysyllables,
until all at once looking askance at Sylvia, he saw that her head had fallen
back, her pretty rosy lips open, her eyes fast shut; in short, she was
asleep.</DD>

<DD>
'Ay,' said Farmer Robson, 'and t' reading has a'most sent me off. Mother
'd look angry now if I was to tell yo' yo' had a right to a kiss; but when
I was a young man I'd ha' kissed a pretty girl as I saw asleep, afore yo'd
said Jack Robson.'</DD>

<DD>
Philip trembled at these words, and looked at his aunt. She gave him no
encouragement, standing up, and making as though she had never heard her
husband's speech, by extending her hand, and wishing him 'good-night.'
At the noise of the chairs moving over the flag floor, Sylvia started up,
confused and annoyed at her father's laughter.</DD>

<DD>
'Ay, lass; it's iver a good time t' fall asleep when a young fellow is
by. Here's Philip here as thou'rt bound t' give a pair o' gloves to.'</DD>

<DD>
Sylvia went like fire; she turned to her mother to read her face.</DD>

<DD>
'It's only father's joke, lass,' said she. 'Philip knows manners too well.'</DD>

<DD>
'He'd better,' said Sylvia, flaming round at him. 'If he'd a touched me,
I'd niver ha' spoken to him no more.' And she looked even as it was as
if she was far from forgiving him.</DD>

<DD>
'Hoots, lass! wenches are brought up sa mim, now-a-days; i' my time they'd
ha' thought na' such great harm of a kiss.'</DD>

<DD>
'Good-night, Philip,' said Bell Robson, thinking the conversation unseemly.</DD>

<DD>
'Good-night, aunt, good-night, Sylvie!' But Sylvia turned her back on him,
and he could hardly say 'good-night' to Daniel, who had caused such an
unpleasant end to an evening that had at one time been going on so well.</DD>
