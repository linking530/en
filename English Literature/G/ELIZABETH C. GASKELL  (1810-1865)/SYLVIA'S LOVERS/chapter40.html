<DD>
After this agitation, and these partial confidences, no more was said on
the subject of Philip for many weeks. They avoided even the slightest allusion
to him; and none of them knew how seldom or how often he might be present
in the minds of the others.</DD>

<DD>
One day the little Bella was unusually fractious with some slight childish
indisposition, and Sylvia was obliged to have recourse to a never-failing
piece of amusement; namely, to take the child into the shop, when the number
of new, bright-coloured articles was sure to beguile the little girl out
of her fretfulness. She was walking along the high terrace of the counter,
kept steady by her mother's hand, when Mr Dawson's market-cart once more
stopped before the door. But it was not Mrs Brunton who alighted now; it
was a very smartly-dressed, very pretty young lady, who put one dainty
foot before the other with care, as if descending from such a primitive
vehicle were a new occurrence in her life. Then she looked up at the names
above the shop-door, and after ascertaining that this was indeed the place
she desired to find, she came in blushing.</DD>

<DD>
'Is Mrs Hepburn at home?' she asked of Hester, whose position in the shop
brought her forwards to receive the customers, while Sylvia drew Bella
out of sight behind some great bales of red flannel.</DD>

<DD>
'Can I see her?' the sweet, south-country voice went on, still addressing
Hester. Sylvia heard the inquiry, and came forwards, with a little rustic
awkwardness, feeling both shy and curious.</DD>

<DD>
'Will yo' please walk this way, ma'am?' said she, leading her visitor back
into her own dominion of the parlour, and leaving Bella to Hester's willing
care.</DD>

<DD>
'You don't know me!' said the pretty young lady, joyously. 'But I think
you knew my husband. I am Mrs Kinraid!'</DD>

<DD>
A sob of surprise rose to Sylvia's lips--she choked it down, however, and
tried to conceal any emotion she might feel, in placing a chair for her
visitor, and trying to make her feel welcome, although, if the truth must
be told, Sylvia was wondering all the time why her visitor came, and how
soon she would go.</DD>

<DD>
'You knew Captain Kinraid, did you not?' said the young lady, with innocent
inquiry; to which Sylvia's lips formed the answer, 'Yes,' but no clear
sound issued therefrom.</DD>

<DD>
'But I know your husband knew the captain; is he at home yet? Can I speak
to him? I do so want to see him.'</DD>

<DD>
Sylvia was utterly bewildered; Mrs Kinraid, this pretty, joyous, prosperous
little bird of a woman, Philip, Charley's wife, what could they have in
common? what could they know of each other? All she could say in answer
to Mrs Kinraid's eager questions, and still more eager looks, was, that
her husband was from home, had been long from home: she did not know where
he was, she did not know when he would come back.</DD>

<DD>
Mrs Kinraid's face fell a little, partly from her own real disappointment,
partly out of sympathy with the hopeless, indifferent tone of Sylvia's
replies.</DD>

<DD>
'Mrs Dawson told me he had gone away rather suddenly a year ago, but I
thought he might be come home by now. I am expecting the captain early
next month. Oh! how I should have liked to see Mr Hepburn, and to thank
him for saving the captain's life!'</DD>

<DD>
'What do yo' mean?' asked Sylvia, stirred out of all assumed indifference.
'The captain! is that' (not 'Charley,' she could not use that familiar
name to the pretty young wife before her) 'yo'r husband?'</DD>

<DD>
'Yes, you knew him, didn't you? when he used to be staying with Mr Corney,
his uncle?'</DD>

<DD>
'Yes, I knew him; but I don't. understand. Will yo' please to tell me all
about it, ma'am?' said Sylvia, faintly.</DD>

<DD>
'I thought your husband would have told you all about it; I hardly know
where to begin. You know my husband is a sailor?'</DD>

<DD>
Sylvia nodded assent, listening greedily, her heart beating thick all the
time.</DD>

<DD>
'And he's now a Commander in the Royal Navy, all earned by his own bravery!
Oh! I am so proud of him!'</DD>

<DD>
So could Sylvia have been if she had been his wife; as it was, she thought
how often she had felt sure that he would be a great man some day.</DD>

<DD>
'And he has been at the siege of Acre.'</DD>

<DD>
Sylvia looked perplexed at these strange words, and Mrs Kinraid caught
the look.</DD>

<DD>
'St. Jean d'Acre, you know--though it's fine saying "you know," when I
didn't know a bit about it myself till the captain's ship was ordered there,
though I was the head girl at Miss Dobbin's in the geography class--Acre
is a seaport town, not far from Jaffa, which is the modern name for Joppa,
where St. Paul went to long ago; you've read of that, I'm sure, and Mount
Carmel, where the prophet Elijah was once, all in Palestine, you know,
only the Turks have got it now?'</DD>

<DD>
'But I don't understand yet,' said Sylvia, plaintively; 'I daresay it's
all very true about St. Paul, but please, ma'am, will yo' tell me about
yo'r husband and mine--have they met again?'</DD>

<DD>
'Yes, at Acre, I tell you,' said Mrs Kinraid, with pretty petulance. 'The
Turks held the town, and the French wanted to take it; and we, that is
the British Fleet, wouldn't let them. So Sir Sidney Smith, a commodore
and a great friend of the captain's, landed in order to fight the French;
and the captain and many of the sailors landed with him; and it was burning
hot; and the poor captain was wounded, and lay a-dying of pain and thirst
within the enemy's--that is the French--fire; so that they were ready to
shoot any one of his own side who came near him. They thought he was dead
himself, you see, as he was very near; and would have been too, if your
husband had not come out of shelter, and taken him up in his arms or on
his back (I couldn't make out which), and carried him safe within the walls.'</DD>

<DD>
'It couldn't have been Philip,' said Sylvia, dubiously.</DD>

<DD>
'But it was. The captain says so; and he's not a man to be mistaken. I
thought I'd got his letter with me; and I would have read you a part of
it, but I left it at Mrs Dawson's in my desk; and I can't send it to you,'
blushing as she remembered certain passages in which 'the captain' wrote
very much like a lover, 'or else I would. But you may be quite sure it
was your husband that ventured into all that danger to save his old friend's
life, or the captain would not have said so.'</DD>

<DD>
'But they weren't--they weren't--not to call great friends.'</DD>

<DD>
'I wish I'd got the letter here; I can't think how I could be so stupid;
I think I can almost remember the very words, though--I've read them over
so often. He says, "Just as I gave up all hope, I saw one Philip Hepburn,
a man whom I had known at Monkshaven, and whom I had some reason to remember
well"--(I'm sure he says so--"remember well"), "he saw me too, and came
at the risk of his life to where I lay. I fully expected he would be shot
down; and I shut my eyes not to see the end of my last chance. The shot
rained about him, and I think he was hit; but he took me up and carried
me under cover." I'm sure he says that, I've read it over so often; and
he goes on and says how he hunted for Mr Hepburn all through the ships,
as soon as ever he could; but he could hear nothing of him, either alive
or dead. Don't go so white, for pity's sake!' said she, suddenly startled
by Sylvia's blanching colour. 'You see, because he couldn't find him alive
is no reason for giving him up as dead; because his name wasn't to be found
on any of the ships' books; so the captain thinks he must have been known
by a different name to his real one. Only he says he should like to have
seen him to have thanked him; and he says he would give a deal to know
what has become of him; and as I was staying two days at Mrs Dawson's,
I told them I must come over to Monkshaven, if only for five minutes, just
to hear if your good husband was come home, and to shake his hands, that
helped to save my own dear captain.'</DD>

<DD>
'I don't think it could have been Philip,' reiterated Sylvia.</DD>

<DD>
'Why not?' asked her visitor; 'you say you don't know where he is; why
mightn't he have been there where the captain says he was?'</DD>

<DD>
'But he wasn't a sailor, nor yet a soldier.'</DD>

<DD>
'Oh! but he was. I think somewhere the captain calls him a marine; that's
neither one nor the other, but a little of both. He'll be coming home some
day soon; and then you'll see!'</DD>

<DD>
Alice Rose came in at this minute, and Mrs Kinraid jumped to the conclusion
that she was Sylvia's mother, and in her overflowing gratitude and friendliness
to all the family of him who had 'saved the captain' she went forward,
and shook the old woman's hand in that pleasant confiding way that wins
all hearts.</DD>

<DD>
'Here's your daughter, ma'am!' said she to the half-astonished, half-pleased
Alice. 'I'm Mrs Kinraid, the wife of the captain that used to be in these
parts, and I'm come to bring her news of her husband, and she don't half
believe me, though it's all to his credit, I'm sure.'</DD>

<DD>
Alice looked so perplexed that Sylvia felt herself bound to explain.</DD>

<DD>
'She says he's either a soldier or a sailor, and a long way off at some
place named in t' Bible.'</DD>

<DD>
'Philip Hepburn led away to be a soldier!' said she, 'who had once been
a Quaker?'</DD>

<DD>
'Yes, and a very brave one too, and one that it would do my heart good
to look upon,' exclaimed Mrs Kinraid. 'He's been saving my husband's life
in the Holy Land, where Jerusalem is, you know.'</DD>

<DD>
'Nay!' said Alice, a little scornfully. 'I can forgive Sylvia for not being
over keen to credit thy news. Her man of peace becoming a man of war; and
suffered to enter Jerusalem, which is a heavenly and a typical city at
this time; while me, as is one of the elect, is obliged to go on dwelling
in Monkshaven, just like any other body.'</DD>

<DD>
'Nay, but,' said Mrs Kinraid, gently, seeing she was touching on delicate
ground, 'I did not say he had gone to Jerusalem, but my husband saw him
in those parts, and he was doing his duty like a brave, good man; ay, and
more than his duty; and, you may take my word for it, he'll be at home
some day soon, and all I beg is that you'll let the captain and me know,
for I'm sure if we can, we'll both come and pay our respects to him. And
I'm very glad I've seen you,' said she, rising to go, and putting out her
hand to shake that of Sylvia; 'for, besides being Hepburn's wife, I'm pretty
sure I've heard the captain speak of you; and if ever you come to Bristol
I hope you'll come and see us on Clifton Downs.'</DD>

<DD>
She went away, leaving Sylvia almost stunned by the new ideas presented
to her. Philip a soldier! Philip in a battle, risking his life. Most strange
of all, Charley and Philip once more meeting together, not as rivals or
as foes, but as saviour and saved! Add to all this the conviction, strengthened
by every word that happy, loving wife had uttered, that Kinraid's old,
passionate love for herself had faded away and vanished utterly: its very
existence apparently blotted out of his memory. She had torn up her love
for him by the roots, but she felt as if she could never forget that it
had been.</DD>

<DD>
Hester brought back Bella to her mother. She had not liked to interrupt
the conversation with the strange lady before; and now she found her mother
in an obvious state of excitement; Sylvia quieter than usual.</DD>

<DD>
'That was Kinraid's wife, Hester! Him that was th' specksioneer as made
such a noise about t' place at the time of Darley's death. He's now a captain--a
navy captain, according to what she says. And she'd fain have us believe
that Philip is abiding in all manner of Scripture places; places as has
been long done away with, but the similitude whereof is in the heavens,
where the elect shall one day see them. And she says Philip is there, and
a soldier, and that he saved her husband's life, and is coming home soon.
I wonder what John and Jeremiah 'll say to his soldiering then? It'll noane
be to their taste, I'm thinking.'</DD>

<DD>
This was all very unintelligible to Hester, and she would dearly have liked
to question Sylvia; but Sylvia sate a little apart, with Bella on her knee,
her cheek resting on her child's golden curls, and her eyes fixed and almost
trance-like, as if she were seeing things not present.</DD>

<DD>
So Hester had to be content with asking her mother as many elucidatory
questions as she could; and after all did not gain a very clear idea of
what had really been said by Mrs Kinraid, as her mother was more full of
the apparent injustice of Philip's being allowed the privilege of treading
on holy ground--if, indeed, that holy ground existed on this side heaven,
which she was inclined to dispute--than to confine herself to the repetition
of words, or narration' of facts.</DD>

<DD>
Suddenly Sylvia roused herself to a sense of Hester's deep interest and
balked inquiries, and she went over the ground rapidly.</DD>

<DD>
'Yo'r mother says right--she is his wife. And he's away fighting; and got
too near t' French as was shooting and firing all round him; and just then,
according to her story, Philip saw him, and went straight into t' midst
o' t' shots, and fetched him out o' danger. That's what she says, and upholds.'</DD>

<DD>
'And why should it not be?' asked Hester, her cheek flushing.</DD>

<DD>
But Sylvia only shook her head, and said,</DD>

<DD>
'I cannot tell. It may be so. But they'd little cause to be friends, and
it seems all so strange--Philip a soldier, and them meeting theere after
all!'</DD>

<DD>
Hester laid the story of Philip's bravery to her heart--she fully believed
in it. Sylvia pondered it more deeply still; the causes for her disbelief,
or, at any rate, for her wonder, were unknown to Hester! Many a time she
sank to sleep with the picture of the event narrated by Mrs Kinraid as
present to her mind as her imagination or experience could make it: first
one figure prominent, then another. Many a morning she wakened up, her
heart beating wildly, why, she knew not, till she shuddered at the remembrance
of the scenes that had passed in her dreams: scenes that might be acted
in reality that very day; for Philip might come back, and then?</DD>

<DD>
And where was Philip all this time, these many weeks, these heavily passing
months?</DD>
