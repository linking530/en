As Ruth went along the accustomed streets, every sight and every sound
seemed to hear a new meaning, and each and all to have some reference to
her boy's disgrace. She held her head down, and scudded along dizzy with
fear, lest some word should have told him what she had been, and what he
was, before she could reach him. It was a wild, unreasoning fear, but it
took hold of her as strongly as if it had been well founded. And, indeed,
the secret whispered by Mrs. Pearson, whose curiosity and suspicion had
been excited by Jemima's manner, and confirmed since by many a little corroborating
circumstance, had spread abroad, and was known to most of the gossips in
Eccleston before it reached Mr. Bradshaw's ears.</DD>

<DD>
As Ruth came up to the door of the Chapel-house, it was opened, and Leonard
came out, bright and hopeful as the morning, his face radiant at the prospect
of the happy day before him. He was dressed in the clothes it had been
such a pleasant pride to her to make for him. He had the dark-blue ribbon
tied round his neck that she had left out for him that very morning, with
a smiling thought of how it would set off his brown, handsome face. She
caught him by the hand as they met, and turned him, with his face homewards,
without a word. Her looks, her rushing movement, her silence, awed him;
and although he wondered, he did not stay to ask why she did so. The door
was on the latch; she opened it, and only said, "Upstairs," in a hoarse
whisper. Up they went into her own room. She drew him in, and bolted the
door; and then, sitting down, she placed him (she had never let go of him)
before her, holding him with her hands on each of his shoulders, and gazing
into his face with a woeful lock of the agony that could not find vent
in words. At last she tried to speak: she tried with strong bodily effort,
almost amounting to convulsion. But the words would not come; it was not
till she saw the absolute terror depicted on his face that she found utterance;
and then the sight of that terror changed the words from what she meant
them to have been. She drew him to her, and laid her head upon his shoulder;
hiding her face even there.</DD>

<DD>
"My poor, poor boy! my poor, poor darling! Oh! would that I had died--I
had died, in my innocent girlhood!"</DD>

<DD>
"Mother! mother!" sobbed Leonard. "What is the matter? Why do you look
so wild and ill? Why do you call me your 'poor boy'? Are we not going to
Scaurside Hill? I don't much mind it, mother; only please don't gasp and
quiver so. Dearest mother, are you ill? Let me call Aunt Faith!"</DD>

<DD>
Ruth lifted herself up, and put away the hair that had fallen over and
was blinding her eyes. She looked at him with intense wistfulness.</DD>

<DD>
"Kiss me, Leonard!" said she--"kiss me, my darling, once more in the old
way!" Leonard threw himself into her arms and hugged her with all his force,
and their lips clung together as in the kiss given to the dying.</DD>

<DD>
"Leonard!" said she at length, holding him away from her, and nerving herself
up to tell him all by one spasmodic effort--"listen to me." The boy stood
breathless and still, gazing at her. On her impetuous transit from Mr.
Bradshaw's to the Chapel-house her wild, desperate thought had been that
she would call herself by every violent, coarse name which the world might
give her--that Leonard should hear those words applied to his mother first
from her own lips; but the influence of his presence--for he was a holy
and sacred creature in her eyes, and this point remained steadfast, though
all the rest were upheaved--subdued her; and now it seemed as if she could
not find words fine enough, and pure enough, to convey the truth that he
must learn, and should learn from no tongue but hers.</DD>

<DD>
"Leonard! when I was very young I did very wrong. I think God, who knows
all, will judge me more tenderly than men--but I did wrong in a way which
you cannot understand yet" (she saw the red flush come into his cheek,
and it stung her as the first token of that shame which was to be his portion
through life)--"in a way people never forget, never forgive. You will hear
me called the hardest names that ever can be thrown at women--I have been
to-day; and, my child, you must bear it patiently, because they will be
partly true. Never get confused, by your love for me, into thinking that
what I did was right.--Where was I?" said she, suddenly faltering, and
forgetting all she had said and all she had got to say; and then, seeing
Leonard's face of wonder, and burning shame and indignation, she went on
more rapidly, as fearing lest her strength should fail before she had ended.</DD>

<DD>
"And, Leonard," continued she, in a trembling, sad voice, "this is not
all. The punishment of punishments lies awaiting me still. It is to see
you suffer from my wrongdoing. Yes, darling! they will speak shameful things
of you, poor innocent child! as well as of me, who am guilty. They will
throw it in your teeth through life, that your mother was never married--was
not married when you were born----"</DD>

<DD>
"Were not you married? Are not you a widow?" asked he abruptly, for the
first time getting anything like a clear idea of the real state of the
case.</DD>

<DD>
"No! May God forgive me, and help me!" exclaimed she, as she saw a strange
look of repugnance cloud over the boy's face, and felt a slight motion
on his part to extricate himself from her hold. It was as slight, as transient
as it could be--over in an instant. But she had taken her hands away, and
covered up her face with them as quickly--covered up her face in shame
before her child; and in the bitterness of her heart she was wailing out,
"Oh! would to God I had died--that I had died as a baby--that I had died
as a little baby hanging at my mother's breast!"</DD>

<DD>
"Mother," said Leonard, timidly putting his hand on her arm; but she shrank
from him, and continued her low, passionate wailing. "Mother," said he,
after a pause coming nearer, though she saw it not--"mammy darling," said
he, using the caressing name, which he had been trying to drop as not sufficiently
manly, "mammy, my own, own dear, dear darling mother, I don't believe them;
I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't!" He broke out into a wild burst of
crying as he said this. In a moment her arms were round the boy, and she
was hushing him up like a baby on her bosom. "Hush, Leonard! Leonard, be
still, my child! I have been too sudden with you!--I have done you harm--oh!
I have done you nothing but harm," cried she, in a tone of bitter self-reproach.</DD>

<DD>
"No, mother," said he, stopping his tears, and his eyes blazing out with
earnestness; "there never was such a mother as you have been to me, and
I won't believe any one who says it. I won't; and I'll knock them down
if they say it again, I will!" He clenched his fist, with a fierce, defiant
look on his face.</DD>

<DD>
"You forget, my child," said Ruth, in the sweetest, saddest tone that ever
was heard, "I said it of myself; I said it because it was true." Leonard
threw his arms tight round her and hid his face against her bosom. She
felt him pant there like some hunted creature. She had no soothing comfort
to give him. "Oh, that she and he lay dead!"</DD>

<DD>
At last, exhausted, he lay so still and motionless, that she feared to
look. She wanted him to speak, yet dreaded his first words. She kissed
his hair, his head, his very clothes; murmuring low, inarticulate, and
moaning sounds.</DD>

<DD>
"Leonard," said she, "Leonard, look up at me! Leonard, look up!" But he
only clung the closer, and hid his face the more.</DD>

<DD>
"My boy!" said she, "what can I do or say? If I tell you never to mind
it--that it is nothing--I tell you false. It is a bitter shame and a sorrow
that I have drawn down upon you. A shame, Leonard, because of me, your
mother; but, Leonard, it is no disgrace or lowering of you in the eyes
of God." She spoke now as if she had found the clue which might lead him
to rest and strength at last. "Remember that, always. Remember that, when
the time of trial comes--and it seems a hard and cruel thing that you should
be called reproachful names by men, and all for what was no fault of yours--remember
God's pity and God's justice; and, though my sin shall have made you an
outcast in the world--oh, my child, my child"--(she felt him kiss her,
as if mutually trying to comfort her--it gave her strength to go on)--"remember,
darling of my heart, it is only your own sin that can make you an outcast
from God."</DD>

<DD>
She grew so faint that her hold of him relaxed. He looked up affrighted.
He brought her water--he threw it over her; in his terror at the notion
that she was going to die and leave him, he called her by every fond name,
imploring her to open her eyes.</DD>

<DD>
When she partially recovered he helped her to the bed, on which she lay
still, wan, and death-like. She almost hoped the swoon that hung around
her might be Death, and in that imagination she opened her eyes to take
a last look at her boy. She saw him pale and terror-stricken; and pity
for his affright roused her, and made her forget herself in the wish that
he should not see her death, if she were indeed dying.</DD>

<DD>
"Go to Aunt Faith!" whispered she; "I am weary, and want sleep."</DD>

<DD>
Leonard arose slowly and reluctantly. She tried to smile upon him, that
what she thought would be her last look might dwell in his remembrance
as tender and strong; she watched him to the door; she saw him hesitate,
and return to her. He came back to her, and said in a timid, apprehensive
tone,</DD>

<DD>
"Mother--will <I>they</I> speak to me about----it?"</DD>

<DD>
Ruth closed her eyes, that they might not express the agony she felt, like
a sharp knife, at this question. Leonard had asked it with a child's desire
of avoiding painful and mysterious topics,--for no personal sense of shame
as she understood it, shame beginning thus early, thus instantaneously.</DD>

<DD>
"No," she replied. "You may be sure they will not."</DD>

<DD>
So he went. But now she would have been thankful for the unconsciousness
of fainting; that one little speech bore so much meaning to her hot, irritable
brain. Mr. and Miss Benson, all in their house, would never speak to the
boy--but in his home alone would he be safe from what he had already learned
to dread. Every form in which shame and opprobrium could overwhelm her
darling haunted her. She had been exercising strong self-control for his
sake ever since she had met him at the house-door; there was now a reaction.
His presence had kept her mind on its perfect balance. When that was withdrawn
the effect of the strain of power was felt. And athwart the fever-mists
that arose to obscure her judgment, all sorts of will-o'-the-wisp plans
flittered before her; tempting her to this and that course of action--to
anything rather than patient endurance--to relieve her present state of
misery by some sudden spasmodic effort, that took the semblance of being
wise and right. Gradually all her desires, all her longing, settled themselves
on one point. What had she done--what could she do, to Leonard but evil?
If she were away, and gone no one knew where--lost in mystery, as if she
were dead--perhaps the cruel hearts might relent, and show pity on Leonard;
while her perpetual presence would but call up the remembrance of his birth.
Thus she reasoned in her hot, dull brain; and shaped her plans in accordance.</DD>

<DD>
Leonard stole downstairs noiselessly. He listened to find some quiet place
where he could hide himself. The house was very still. Miss Benson thought
the purposed expedition had taken place, and never dreamed but that Ruth
and Leonard were on distant, sunny Scaurside Hill; and, after a very early
dinner, she had set out to drink tea with a farmer's wife, who lived in
the country two or three miles off. Mr. Benson meant to have gone with
her; but, while they were at dinner, he had received an unusually authoritative
note from Mr. Bradshaw desiring to speak with him, so he went to that gentleman's
house instead. Sally was busy in her kitchen, making a great noise (not
unlike a groom rubbing down a horse) over her cleaning. Leonard stole into
the sitting-room, and crouched behind the large old-fashioned sofa to ease
his sore, aching heart, by crying with all the prodigal waste and abandonment
of childhood.</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Benson was shown into Mr. Bradshaw's own particular room. The latter
gentleman was walking up and down, and it was easy to perceive that something
had occurred to chafe him to great anger.</DD>

<DD>
"Sit down, sir!" said he to Mr. Benson, nodding to a chair.</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Benson sat down. But Mr. Bradshaw continued his walk for a few minutes
longer without speaking. Then he stopped abruptly, right in front of Mr.
Benson; and in a voice which he tried to render calm, but which trembled
with passion--with a face glowing purple as he thought of his wrongs (and
real wrongs they were), he began--</DD>

<DD>
"Mr. Benson, I have sent for you to ask--I am almost too indignant at the
bare suspicion to speak as becomes me--but did you----I really shall be
obliged to beg your pardon, if you are as much in the dark as I was yesterday
as to the character of the woman who lives under your roof?"</DD>

<DD>
There was no answer from Mr. Benson. Mr. Bradshaw looked at him very earnestly.
His eyes were fixed on the ground--he made no inquiry--he uttered no expression
of wonder or dismay. Mr. Bradshaw ground his foot on the floor with gathering
rage; but just as he was about to speak Mr. Benson rose up--a poor deformed
old man--before the stern and portly figure that was swelling and panting
with passion.</DD>

<DD>
"Hear me, sir!" (stretching out his hand as if to avert the words which
were impending). "Nothing you can say can upbraid me like my own conscience;
no degradation you can inflict, by word or deed, can come up to the degradation
I have suffered for years, at being a party to a deceit, even for a good
end----"</DD>

<DD>
"For a good end!--Nay! what next?"</DD>

<DD>
The taunting contempt with which Mr. Bradshaw spoke these words almost
surprised himself by what he imagined must be its successful power of withering;
but in spite of it Mr. Benson lifted his grave eyes to Mr. Bradshaw's countenance,
and repeated--</DD>

<DD>
"For a good end. The end was not, as perhaps you consider it to have been,
to obtain her admission into your family--nor yet to put her in the way
of gaining her livelihood; my sister and I would willingly have shared
what we have with her; it was our intention to do so at first, if not for
any length of time, at least as long as her health might require it. Why
I advised (perhaps I only yielded to advice) a change of name--an assumption
of a false state of widowhood--was because I earnestly desired to place
her in circumstances in which she might work out her self-redemption; and
you, sir, know how terribly the world goes against all such as have sinned
as Ruth did. She was so young, too."</DD>

<DD>
"You mistake, sir; my acquaintance has not lain so much among that class
of sinners as to give me much experience of the way in which they are treated.
But, judging from what I have seen, I should say they meet with full as
much leniency as they deserve; and supposing they do not--I know there
are plenty of sickly sentimentalists just now who reserve all their interest
and regard for criminals--why not pick out one of these to help you in
your task of washing the blackamoor white? Why choose me to be imposed
upon--my household into which to intrude your <I>protegee</I>? Why were
my innocent children to be exposed to corruption? I say," said Mr. Bradshaw,
stamping his foot, "how dared you come into this house, where you were
looked upon as a minister of religion, with a lie in your mouth? How dared
you single me out, of all people, to be gulled, and deceived, and pointed
at through the town as the person who had taken an abandoned woman into
his house to teach his daughters?"</DD>

<DD>
"I own my deceit was wrong and faithless."</DD>

<DD>
"Yes! you can own it, now it is found out! There is small merit in that,
I think!"</DD>

<DD>
"Sir! I claim no merit. I take shame to myself. I did not single you out.
You applied to me with your proposal that Ruth should be your children's
governess."</DD>

<DD>
"Pah!"</DD>

<DD>
"And the temptation was too great--no! I will not say that--but the temptation
was greater than I could stand--it seemed to open out a path of usefulness."</DD>

<DD>
"Now, don't let me hear you speak so," said Mr. Bradshaw, blazing up. "I
can't stand it. It is too much to talk in that way when the usefulness
was to consist in contaminating my innocent girls."</DD>

<DD>
"God knows that if I had believed there had been any danger of such contamination--God
knows how I would have died sooner than have allowed her to enter your
family. Mr. Bradshaw, you believe me, don't you?" asked Mr. Benson earnestly.</DD>

<DD>
"I really must be allowed the privilege of doubting what you say in future,"
said Mr. Bradshaw, in a cold, contemptuous manner.</DD>

<DD>
"I have deserved this," Mr. Benson replied. "But," continued he, after
a moment's pause, "I will not speak of myself, but of Ruth. Surely, sir,
the end I aimed at (the means I took to obtain it were wrong; you cannot
feel that more than I do) was a right one; and you will not--you cannot
say that your children have suffered from associating with her. I had her
in my family, under the watchful eyes of three anxious persons for a year
or more we saw faults--no human being is without them--and poor Ruth's
were but slight venial errors; but we saw no sign of a corrupt mind--no
glimpse of boldness or forwardness--no token of want of conscientiousness;
she seemed, and was, a young and gentle girl, who had been led astray before
she fairly knew what life was."</DD>

<DD>
"I suppose most depraved women have been innocent in their time," said
Mr. Bradshaw, with bitter contempt.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, Mr. Bradshaw! Ruth was not depraved, and you know it. You cannot have
seen her--have known her daily, all these years, without acknowledging
that!" Mr. Benson was almost breathless, awaiting Mr. Bradshaw's answer.
The quiet self-control which he had maintained so long was gone now.</DD>

<DD>
"I saw her daily--I did <I>not</I> know her. If I had known her, I should
have known she was fallen and depraved, and consequently not fit to come
into my house, nor to associate with my pure children."</DD>

<DD>
"Now I wish God would give me power to speak out convincingly what I believe
to be His truth, that not every woman who has fallen is depraved; that
many--how many the Great Judgment Day will reveal to those who have shaken
off the poor, sore, penitent hearts on earth--many, many crave and hunger
after a chance of virtue--the help which no man gives to them--help--that
gentle, tender help which Jesus gave once to Mary Magdalen." Mr. Benson
was almost choked by his own feelings.</DD>

<DD>
"Come, come, Mr. Benson, let us have no more of this morbid way of talking.
The world has decided how such women are to be treated; and, you may depend
upon it, there is so much practical wisdom in the world, that its way of
acting is right in the long-run, and that no one can fly in its face with
impunity, unless, indeed, they stoop to deceit and imposition."</DD>

<DD>
"I take my stand with Christ against the world," said Mr. Benson solemnly,
disregarding the covert allusion to himself. "What have the world's ways
ended in? Can we be much worse than we are?"</DD>

<DD>
"Speak for yourself, if you please."</DD>

<DD>
"Is it not time to change some of our ways of thinking and acting? I declare
before God, that if I believe in any one human truth, it is this--that
to every woman who, like Ruth, has sinned should be given a chance of self-redemption--and
that such a chance should be given in no supercilious or contemptuous manner,
but in the spirit of the holy Christ."</DD>

<DD>
"Such as getting her into a friend's house under false colours."</DD>

<DD>
"I do not argue on Ruth's case. In that I have acknowledged my error. I
do not argue on any case. I state my firm belief, that it is God's will
that we should not dare to trample any of His creatures down to the hopeless
dust; that it is God's will that the women who have fallen should be numbered
among those who have broken hearts to be bound up, not cast aside as lost
beyond recall. If this be God's will, as a thing of God it will stand;
and He will open a way."</DD>

<DD>
"I should have attached much more importance to all your exhortation on
this point if I could have respected your conduct in other matters. As
it is, when I see a man who has deluded himself into considering falsehood
right, I am disinclined to take his opinion on subjects connected with
morality; and I can no longer regard him as a fitting exponent of the will
of God. You perhaps understand what I mean, Mr. Benson. I can no longer
attend your chapel."</DD>

<DD>
If Mr. Benson had felt any hope of making Mr. Bradshaw's obstinate mind
receive the truth, that he acknowledged and repented of his connivance
at the falsehood by means of which Ruth had been received into the Bradshaw
family, this last sentence prevented his making the attempt. He simply
bowed and took his leave--Mr. Bradshaw attending him to the door with formal
ceremony.</DD>

<DD>
He felt acutely the severance of the tie which Mr. Bradshaw had just announced
to him. He had experienced many mortifications in his intercourse with
that gentleman, but they had fallen off from his meek spirit like drops
of water from a bird's plumage; and now he only remembered the acts of
substantial kindness rendered (the ostentation all forgotten)--many happy
hours and pleasant evenings--the children whom he had loved dearer than
he thought till now--the young people about whom he had cared, and whom
he had striven to lead aright. He was but a young man when Mr. Bradshaw
first came to his chapel; they had grown old together; he had never recognised
Mr. Bradshaw as an old familiar friend so completely as now when they were
severed.</DD>

<DD>
It was with a heavy heart that he opened his own door. He went to his study
immediately; he sat down to steady himself into his position.</DD>

<DD>
How long he was there--silent and alone--reviewing his life--confessing
his sins--he did not know; but he heard some unusual sound in the house
that disturbed him--roused him to present life. A slow, languid step came
along the passage to the front door--the breathing was broken by many sighs.</DD>

<DD>
Ruth's hand was on the latch when Mr. Benson came out. Her face was very
white, except two red spots on each cheek--her eyes were deep-sunk and
hollow, but glittered with feverish lustre. "Ruth!" exclaimed he. She moved
her lips, but her throat and mouth were too dry for her to speak.</DD>

<DD>
"Where are you going?" asked he; for she had all her walking things on,
yet trembled so even as she stood, that it was evident she could not walk
far without falling.</DD>

<DD>
She hesitated--she looked up at him, still with the same dry glittering
eyes. At last she whispered (for she could only speak in a whisper), "To
Helmsby--I am going to Helmsby."</DD>

<DD>
"Helmsby! my poor girl--may God have mercy upon you!" for he saw she hardly
knew what she was saying. "Where is Helmsby?"</DD>

<DD>
"I don't know. In Lincolnshire, I think."</DD>

<DD>
"But why are you going there?"</DD>

<DD>
"Hush! he's asleep," said she, as Mr. Benson had unconsciously raised his
voice.</DD>

<DD>
"Who is asleep?" asked Mr. Benson.</DD>

<DD>
"That poor little boy," said she, beginning to quiver and cry.</DD>

<DD>
"Come here!" said he authoritatively, drawing her into the study.</DD>

<DD>
"Sit down in that chair. I will come back directly."</DD>

<DD>
He went in search of his sister, but she had not returned. Then he had
recourse to Sally, who was as busy as ever about her cleaning.</DD>

<DD>
"How long has Ruth been at home?" asked he.</DD>

<DD>
"Ruth! She has never been at home sin' morning. She and Leonard were to
be off for the day somewhere or other with them Bradshaw girls."</DD>

<DD>
"Then she has had no dinner?"</DD>

<DD>
"Not here, any rate. I can't answer for what she may have done at other
places."</DD>

<DD>
"And Leonard--where is he?"</DD>

<DD>
"How should I know? With his mother, I suppose. Leastways, that was what
was fixed on. I've enough to do of my own, without routing after other
folks."</DD>

<DD>
She went on scouring in no very good temper. Mr. Benson stood silent for
a moment.</DD>

<DD>
"Sally," he said, "I want a cup of tea. Will you make it as soon as you
can; and some dry toast too? I'll come for it in ten minutes."</DD>

<DD>
Struck by something in his voice, she looked up at him for the first time.</DD>

<DD>
"What ha' ye been doing to yourself, to look so grim and grey? Tiring yourself
all to tatters, looking after some naught, I'll be bound! Well! well! I
mun make ye your tea, I reckon; but I did hope as you grew older you'd
ha' grown wiser."</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Benson made no reply, but went to look for Leonard, hoping that the
child's presence might bring back to his mother the power of self-control.
He opened the parlour-door, and looked in, but saw no one. Just as he was
shutting it, however, he heard a deep, broken, sobbing sigh; and, guided
by the sound, he found the boy lying on the floor, fast asleep, but with
his features all swollen and disfigured by passionate crying.</DD>

<DD>
"Poor child! This was what she meant, then," thought Mr. Benson. "He has
begun his share of the sorrows too" he continued pitifully. "No! I will
not waken him back to consciousness." So he returned alone into the study.
Ruth sat where he had placed her, her head bent back, and her eyes shut.
But when he came in she started up.</DD>

<DD>
"I must be going," she said in a hurried way.</DD>

<DD>
"Nay, Ruth, you must not go. You must not leave us. We cannot do without
you. We love you too much."</DD>

<DD>
"Love me!" said she, looking at him wistfully. As she looked, her eyes
filled slowly with tears. It was a good sign, and Mr. Benson took heart
to go on.</DD>

<DD>
"Yes! Ruth. You know we do. You may have other things to fill up your mind
just now, but you know we love you; and nothing can alter our love for
you. You ought not to have thought of leaving us. You would not, if you
had been quite well."</DD>

<DD>
"Do you know what has happened?" she asked, in a low, hoarse voice.</DD>

<DD>
"Yes. I know all," he answered. "It makes no difference to us. Why should
it?"</DD>

<DD>
"Oh! Mr. Benson, don't you know that my shame is discovered?" she replied,
bursting into tears--"and I must leave you, and leave Leonard, that you
may not share in my disgrace."</DD>

<DD>
"You must do no such thing. Leave Leonard! You have no right to leave Leonard.
Where could you go to?"</DD>

<DD>
"To Helmsby," she said humbly. "It would break my heart to go, but I think
I ought, for Leonard's sake. I know I ought." She was crying sadly by this
time, but Mr. Benson knew the flow of tears would ease her brain. "It will
break my heart to go, but I know I must."</DD>

<DD>
"Sit still here at present," said he, in a decided tone of command. He
went for the cup of tea. He brought it to her without Sally's being aware
for whom it was intended.</DD>

<DD>
"Drink this!" He spoke as you would do to a child, if desiring it to take
medicine. "Eat some toast." She took the tea, and drank it feverishly;
but when she tried to eat, the food seemed to choke her. Still she was
docile, and she tried.</DD>

<DD>
"I cannot," said she at last, putting down the piece of toast. There was
a return of something of her usual tone in the words. She spoke gently
and softly; no longer in the shrill, hoarse voice she had used at first.
Mr. Benson sat down by her.</DD>

<DD>
"Now, Ruth, we must talk a little together. I want to understand what your
plan was. Where is Helmsby? Why did you fix to go there?"</DD>

<DD>
"It is where my mother lived," she answered. "Before she was married she
lived there; and wherever she lived, the people all loved her dearly; and
I thought--I think, that for her sake, some one would give me work. I meant
to tell them the truth," said she, dropping her eyes; "but still they would,
perhaps, give me some employment--I don't care what--for her sake. I could
do many things," said she, suddenly looking up. "I am sure I could weed--I
could in gardens--if they did not like to have me in their houses. But
perhaps some one, for my mother's sake--oh! my dear, dear mother!--do you
know where and what I am?" she cried out, sobbing afresh.</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Benson's heart was very sore, though he spoke authoritatively, and
almost sternly--</DD>

<DD>
"Ruth! you must be still and quiet. I cannot have this. I want you to listen
to me. Your thought of Helmsby would be a good one, if it was right for
you to leave Eccleston; but I do not think it is. I am certain of this,
that it would be a great sin in you to separate yourself from Leonard.
You have no right to sever the tie by which God has bound you together."</DD>

<DD>
"But if I am here they will all know and remember the shame of his birth;
and if I go away they may forget----"</DD>

<DD>
"And they may not. And if you go away, he may be unhappy or ill; and you,
who above all others have--and have from God--remember <I>that</I>, Ruth!--the
power to comfort him, the tender patience to nurse him, have left him to
the care of strangers. Yes; I know! But we ourselves are as strangers,
dearly as we love him, compared to a mother. He may turn to sin, and want
the long forbearance, the serene authority of a parent and where are you?
No dread of shame, either for yourself, or even for him, can ever make
it right for you to shake off your responsibility." All this time he was
watching her narrowly, and saw her slowly yield herself up to the force
of what he was saying.</DD>

<DD>
"Besides, Ruth," he continued, "we have gone on falsely, hitherto. It has
been my doing, my mistake, my sin. I ought to have known better. Now, let
us stand firm on the truth. You have no new fault to repent of. Be brave
and faithful. It is to God you answer, not to men. The shame of having
your sin known to the world, should be as nothing to the shame you felt
at having sinned. We have dreaded men too much, and God too little, in
the course we have taken. But now be of good cheer. Perhaps you will have
to find your work in the world very low--not quite working in the fields,"
said he, with a gentle smile, to which she, downcast and miserable, could
give no response. "Nay, perhaps, Ruth," he went on, "you may have to stand
and wait for some time; no one may be willing to use the services you would
gladly render; all may turn aside from you, and may speak very harshly
of you. Can you accept all this treatment meekly, as but the reasonable
and just penance God has laid upon you--feeling no anger against those
who slight you, no impatience for the time to come (and come it surely
will--I speak as having the word of God for what I say), when He, having
purified you, even as by fire, will make a straight path for your feet
? My child, it is Christ the Lord who has told us of this infinite mercy
of God. Have you faith enough in it to be brave, and bear on, and do rightly
in patience and in tribulation?"</DD>

<DD>
Ruth had been hushed and very still until now, when the pleading earnestness
of his question urged her to answer.</DD>

<DD>
"Yes!" said she. "I hope--I believe I can be faithful for myself, for I
have sinned and done wrong. But Leonard----" She looked up at him.</DD>

<DD>
"But Leonard," he echoed. "Ah! there it is hard, Ruth. I own the world
is hard and persecuting to such as he." He paused to think of the true
comfort for this sting. He went on. "The world is not everything, Ruth;
nor is the want of men's good opinion and esteem the highest need which
man has. Teach Leonard this. You would not wish his life to be one summer's
day. You dared not make it so, if you had the power. Teach him to bid a
noble, Christian welcome to the trials which God sends--and this is one
of them. Teach him not to look on a life of struggle, and perhaps of disappointment
and incompleteness, as a sad and mournful end, but as the means permitted
to the heroes and warriors in the army of Christ, by which to show their
faithful following. Tell him of the hard and thorny path which was trodden
once by the bleeding feet of One--Ruth! think of the Saviour's life and
cruel death, and of His divine faithfulness. Oh, Ruth! " exclaimed he,
"when I look and see what you may be--what you <I>must</I> be to that boy,
I cannot think how you could be coward enough, for a moment, to shrink
from your work! But we have all been cowards hitherto," he added, in bitter
self-accusation. "God help us to be so no longer!"</DD>

<DD>
Ruth sat very quiet. Her eyes were fixed on the ground, and she seemed
lost in thought. At length she rose up.</DD>

<DD>
"Mr. Benson!" said she, standing before him, and propping herself by the
table, as she was trembling sadly from weakness, "I mean to try very, very
hard, to do my duty to Leonard--and to God," she added reverently. "I am
only afraid my faith may sometimes fail about Leonard----"</DD>

<DD>
"Ask, and it shall be given unto you. That is no vain or untried promise,
Ruth!"</DD>

<DD>
She sat down again, unable longer to stand. There was another long silence.</DD>

<DD>
"I must never go to Mr. Bradshaw's again," she said at last, as if thinking
aloud.</DD>

<DD>
"No, Ruth, you shall not," he answered.</DD>

<DD>
"But I shall earn no money!" added she quickly, for she thought that he
did not perceive the difficulty that was troubling her.</DD>

<DD>
"You surely know, Ruth, that, while Faith and I have a roof to shelter
us, or bread to eat, you and Leonard share it with us."</DD>

<DD>
"I know--I know your most tender goodness," said she, "but it ought not
to be."</DD>

<DD>
"It must be at present," he said, in a decided manner. "Perhaps, before
long you may have some employment; perhaps it may be some time before an
opportunity occurs."</DD>

<DD>
"Hush," said Ruth; "Leonard is moving about in the parlour. I must go to
him."</DD>

<DD>
But when she stood up, she turned so dizzy, and tottered so much, that
she was glad to sit down again immediately.</DD>

<DD>
"You must rest here. I will go to him," said Mr. Benson. He left her; and
when he was gone, she leaned her head on the back of the chair, and cried
quietly and incessantly; but there was a more patient, hopeful, resolved
feeling in the heart, which all along, through all the tears she shed,
bore her onwards to higher thoughts, until at last she rose to prayers.</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Benson caught the new look of shrinking shame in Leonard's eye, as
it first sought, then shunned, meeting his. He was pained, too, by the
sight of the little sorrowful, anxious face, on which, until now, hope
and joy had been predominant. The constrained voice, the few words the
boy spoke, when formerly there would have been a glad and free utterance--all
this grieved Mr. Benson inexpressibly, as but the beginning of an unwonted
mortification, which must last for years. He himself made no allusion to
any unusual occurrence; he spoke of Ruth as sitting, overcome by headache,
in the study for quietness: he hurried on the preparations for tea, while
Leonard sat by in the great arm-chair, and looked on with sad, dreamy eyes.
He strove to lessen the shock which he knew Leonard had received, by every
mixture of tenderness and cheerfulness that Mr. Benson's gentle heart prompted;
and now and then a languid smile stole over the boy's face. When his bedtime
came, Mr. Benson told him of the hour, although he feared that Leonard
would have but another sorrowful crying of himself to sleep; but he was
anxious to accustom the boy to cheerful movement within the limits of domestic
law, and by no disobedience to it to weaken the power of glad submission
to the Supreme; to begin the new life that lay before him, where strength
to look up to God as the Law-giver and Ruler of events would be pre-eminently
required. When Leonard had gone upstairs, Mr. Benson went immediately to
Ruth, and said--</DD>

<DD>
"Ruth! Leonard is just gone up to bed," secure in the instinct which made
her silently rise, and go up to the boy--certain, too, that they would
each be the other's best comforter, and that God would strengthen each
through the other.</DD>

<DD>
Now, for the first time, he had leisure to think of himself; and to go
over all the events of the day. The half-hour of solitude in his study,
that he had before his sister's return, was of inestimable value; he had
leisure to put events in their true places, as to importance and eternal
significance.</DD>

<DD>
Miss Faith came in laden with farm produce. Her kind entertainers had brought
her in their shandry to the opening of the court in which the Chapel-house
stood; but she was so heavily burdened with eggs, mushrooms, and plums,
that, when her brother opened the door, she was almost breathless.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, Thurstan! take this basket--it is such a weight? Oh, Sally, is that
you? Here are some magnum-bonums which we must preserve to-morrow. There
are guinea-fowl eggs in that basket."</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Benson let her unburden her body, and her mind too, by giving charges
to Sally respecting her housekeeping treasures, before he said a word;
but when she returned into the study, to tell him the small pieces of intelligence
respecting her day at the farm, she stood aghast.</DD>

<DD>
"Why, Thurstan, dear! What's the matter? Is your back hurting you?"</DD>

<DD>
He smiled to reassure her; but it was a sickly and forced smile.</DD>

<DD>
"No, Faith! I am quite well, only rather out of spirits, and wanting to
talk to you to cheer me."</DD>

<DD>
Miss Faith sat down, straight, sitting bolt-upright to listen the better.</DD>

<DD>
"I don't know how, but the real story about Ruth is found out."</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, Thurstan!" exclaimed Miss Benson, turning quite white.</DD>

<DD>
For a moment, neither of them said another word. Then she went on--</DD>

<DD>
"Does Mr. Bradshaw know?"</DD>

<DD>
"Yes! He sent for me, and told me."</DD>

<DD>
"Does Ruth know that it has all come out?"</DD>

<DD>
"Yes. And Leonard knows."</DD>

<DD>
"How? Who told him?"</DD>

<DD>
"I do not know. I have asked no questions. But of course it was his mother."</DD>

<DD>
"She was very foolish and cruel, then," said Miss Benson, her eyes blazing,
and her lips trembling, at the thought of the suffering her darling boy
must have gone through.</DD>

<DD>
"I think she was wise. I am sure it was not cruel. He must have soon known
that there was some mystery, and it was better that it should be told him
openly and quietly by his mother than by a stranger."</DD>

<DD>
"How could she tell him quietly?" asked Miss Benson still indignant.</DD>

<DD>
"Well! perhaps I used the wrong word--of course no one was by--and I don't
suppose even they themselves could now tell how it was told, or in what
spirit it was borne."</DD>

<DD>
Miss Benson was silent again.</DD>

<DD>
"Was Mr. Bradshaw very angry?"</DD>

<DD>
"Yes, very; and justly so. I did very wrong in making that false statement
at first."</DD>

<DD>
"No! I am sure you did not," said Miss Faith. "Ruth has had some years
of peace, in which to grow stronger and wiser, so that she can bear her
shame now in a way she never could have done at first."</DD>

<DD>
"All the same it was wrong in me to do what I did."</DD>

<DD>
"I did it too, as much or more than you. And I don't think it wrong. I'm
certain it was quite right, and I would do just the same again."</DD>

<DD>
"Perhaps it has not done you the harm it has done me."</DD>

<DD>
"Nonsense! Thurstan. Don't be morbid. I'm sure you are as good--and better
than ever you were."</DD>

<DD>
"No, I am not. I have got what you call morbid, just in consequence of
the sophistry by which I persuaded myself that wrong could be right. I
torment myself. I have lost my clear instincts of conscience. Formerly,
if I believed that such or such an action was according to the will of
God, I went and did it, or at least I tried to do it, without thinking
of consequences. Now, I reason and weigh what will happen if I do so and
so--I grope where formerly I saw. Oh, Faith! it is such a relief to me
to have the truth known, that I am afraid I have not been sufficiently
sympathising with Ruth."</DD>

<DD>
"Poor Ruth!" said Miss Benson. "But at any rate our telling a lie has been
the saving of her. There is no fear of her going wrong now."</DD>

<DD>
"God's omnipotence did not need our sin."</DD>

<DD>
They did not speak for some time.</DD>

<DD>
"You have not told me what Mr. Bradshaw said."</DD>

<DD>
"One can't remember the exact words that are spoken on either side in moments
of such strong excitement. He was very angry, and said some things about
me that were very just, and some about Ruth that were very hard. His last
words were that he should give up coming to chapel."</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, Thurstan! did it come to that?"</DD>

<DD>
"Yes."</DD>

<DD>
"Does Ruth know all he said?"</DD>

<DD>
"No! Why should she? I don't know if she knows he has spoken to me at all.
Poor creature! she had enough to craze her almost without that! She was
for going away and leaving us, that we might not share in her disgrace.
I was afraid of her being quite delirious. I did so want you, Faith! However,
I did the best I could; I spoke to her very coldly, and almost sternly,
all the while my heart was bleeding for her. I dared not give her sympathy;
I tried to give her strength. But I did so want you, Faith."</DD>

<DD>
"And I was so full of enjoyment, I am ashamed to think of it. But the Dawsons
are so kind--and the day was so fine---- Where is Ruth now?"</DD>

<DD>
"With Leonard. He is her great earthly motive--I thought that being with
him would be best. But he must be in bed and asleep now."</DD>

<DD>
"I will go up to her," said Miss Faith.</DD>

<DD>
She found Ruth keeping watch by Leonard's troubled sleep; but when she
saw Miss Faith she rose up, and threw herself on her neck and clung to
her, without speaking. After a while Miss Benson said--</DD>

<DD>
"You must go to bed, Ruth!" So, after she had kissed the sleeping boy,
Miss Benson led her away, and helped to undress her, and brought her up
a cup of soothing violet-tea--not so soothing as tender actions and soft,
loving tones.</DD>
