<DD>
While Mr. Benson lay awake for fear of oversleeping himself, and so being
late at Mr. Farquhar's (it was somewhere about six o'clock--dark as an
October morning is at that time), Sally came to his door and knocked. She
was always an early riser; and if she had not been gone to bed long before
Mr. Bradshaw's visit last night, Mr. Benson might safely have trusted to
her calling him.</DD>

<DD>
"Here's a woman down below as must see you directly. She'll be upstairs
after me if you're not down quick."</DD>

<DD>
"Is it any one from Clarke's?"</DD>

<DD>
"No, no! not it, master," said she through the keyhole; "I reckon it's
Mrs. Bradshaw, for all she's muffled up."</DD>

<DD>
He needed no other word. When he went down, Mrs. Bradshaw sat in his easy-chair,
swaying her body to and fro, and crying without restraint. Mr. Benson came
up to her, before she was aware that he was there.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh! sir," said she, getting up and taking hold of both his hands, "you
won't be so cruel, will you? I have got some money somewhere--some money
my father settled on me, sir; I don't know how much, but I think it's more
than two thousand pounds, and you shall have it all. If I can't give it
you now, I'll make a will, sir. Only be merciful to poor Dick--don't go
and prosecute him, sir."</DD>

<DD>
"My dear Mrs. Bradshaw, don't you agitate yourself in this way. I never
meant to prosecute him."</DD>

<DD>
"But Mr. Bradshaw says that you must."</DD>

<DD>
"I shall not, indeed. I have told Mr. Bradshaw so."</DD>

<DD>
"Has he been here? Oh! is not he cruel? I don't care. I have been a good
wife till now. I know I have. I have done all he bid me, ever since we
were married. But now I will speak my mind, and say to everybody how cruel
he is--how hard to his own flesh and blood! If he puts poor Dick in prison,
I will go too. If I'm to choose between my husband and my son, I choose
my son; for he will have no friends, unless I am with him."</DD>

<DD>
"Mr. Bradshaw will think better of it. You will see that, when his first
anger and disappointment are over, he will not be hard or cruel."</DD>

<DD>
"You don't know Mr. Bradshaw," said she mournfully, "if you think he'll
change. I might beg and beg--I have done many a time, when we had little
children, and I wanted to save them a whipping--but no begging ever did
any good. At last I left it off. He'll not change."</DD>

<DD>
"Perhaps not for human entreaty. Mrs. Bradshaw, is there nothing more powerful?"</DD>

<DD>
The tone of his voice suggested what he did not say.</DD>

<DD>
"If you mean that God may soften his heart," replied she humbly, "I'm not
going to deny God's power--I have need to think of Him," she continued,
bursting into fresh tears, "for I am a very miserable woman. Only think!
he cast it up against me last night, and said, if I had not spoilt Dick
this never would have happened."</DD>

<DD>
"He hardly knew what he was saying last night. I will go to Mr. Farquhar's
directly, and see him; and you had better go home, my dear Mrs. Bradshaw;
you may rely upon our doing all that we can."</DD>

<DD>
With some difficulty he persuaded her not to accompany him to Mr. Farquhar's;
but he had, indeed, to take her to her own door, before he could convince
her that, at present, she could do nothing but wait the result of the consultations
of others.</DD>

<DD>
It was before breakfast, and Mr. Farquhar was alone; so Mr. Benson had
a quiet opportunity of telling the whole story to the husband before the
wife came down. Mr. Farquhar was not much surprised, though greatly distressed.
The general opinion he had always entertained of Richard's character had
predisposed him to fear, even before the inquiry respecting the Insurance
shares. But it was still a shock when it came, however much it might have
been anticipated.</DD>

<DD>
"What can we do?" said Mr. Benson, as Mr. Farquhar sat gloomily silent.</DD>

<DD>
"That is just what I was asking myself. I think I must see Mr. Bradshaw,
and try and bring him a little out of this unmerciful frame of mind. That
must be the first thing. Will you object to accompany me at once? It seems
of particular consequence that we should subdue its obduracy before the
affair gets wind."</DD>

<DD>
"I will go with you willingly. But I believe I rather serve to irritate
Mr. Bradshaw; he is reminded of things he has said to me formerly, and
which he thinks he is bound to act up to. However, I can walk with you
to the door, and wait for you (if you'll allow me) in the street. I want
to know how he is to-day, both bodily and mentally; for indeed, Mr. Farquhar,
I should not have been surprised last night if he had dropped down dead,
so terrible was his strain upon himself."</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Benson was left at the door as he had desired, while Mr. Farquhar went
in.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, Mr. Farquhar, what is the matter?" exclaimed the girls, running to
him. "Mamma sits crying in the old nursery. We believe she has been there
all night. She will not tell us what it is, nor let us be with her; and
papa is locked up in his room, and won't even answer us when we speak,
though we know he is up and awake, for we heard him tramping about all
night."</DD>

<DD>
"Let me go up to him," said Mr. Farquhar.</DD>

<DD>
"He won't let you in. It will be of no use." But in spite of what they
said, he went up; and to their surprise, after hearing who it was, their
father opened the door, and admitted their brother-in-law. He remained
with Mr. Bradshaw about hall-an-hour, and then came into the dining-room,
where the two girls stood huddled over the fire, regardless of the untasted
breakfast behind them; and, writing a few lines, he desired them to take
his note up to their mother, saying that it would comfort her a little,
and that he should send Jemima, in two or three hours, with the baby--perhaps
to remain some days with him. He had no time to tell them more; Jemima
would.</DD>

<DD>
He left them, and rejoined Mr. Benson. "Come home and breakfast with me.
I am off to London in an hour or two, and must speak with you first."</DD>

<DD>
On reaching his house, he ran upstairs to ask Jemima to breakfast alone
in her dressing-room, and returned in five minutes or less.</DD>

<DD>
"Now I can tell you about it," said he. "I see my way clearly to a certain
point. We must prevent Dick and his father meeting just now, or all hope
of Dick's reformation is gone for ever. His father is as hard as the nether
millstone. He has forbidden me his house."</DD>

<DD>
"Forbidden you!"</DD>

<DD>
"Yes; because I would not give up Dick as utterly lost and bad; and because
I said I should return to London with the clerk, and fairly tell Dennison
(he's a Scotchman, and a man of sense and feeling) the real state of the
case. By the way, we must not say a word to the clerk; otherwise he will
expect an answer, and make out all sorts of inferences for himself, from
the unsatisfactory reply he must have. Dennison will be upon honour--will
see every side of the case--will know you refuse to prosecute; the Company
of which he is manager are no losers. Well! when I said what I thought
wise, of all this--when I spoke as if my course were a settled and decided
thing, the grim old man asked me if he was to be an automaton in his own
house. He assured me he had no feeling for Dick--all the time he was shaking
like an aspen; in short, repeating much the same things he must have said
to you last night. However, I defied him, and the consequence is, I'm forbidden
the house, and, what is more, he says he will not come to the office while
I remain a partner."</DD>

<DD>
"What shall you do?"</DD>

<DD>
"Send Jemima and the baby. There's nothing like a young child for bringing
people round to a healthy state of feeling; and you don't know what Jemima
is, Mr. Benson! No! though you've known her from her birth. If she can't
comfort her mother, and if the baby can't steal into her grandfather's
heart, why--I don't know what you may do to me. I shall tell Jemima all,
and trust to her wit and wisdom to work at this end, while I do my best
at the other."</DD>

<DD>
"Richard is abroad, is not he?"</DD>

<DD>
"He will be in England to-morrow. I must catch him somewhere; but that
I can easily do. The difficult point will be, what to do with him--what
to say to him, when I find him. He must give up his partnership, that's
clear. I did not tell his father so, but I am resolved upon it. There shall
be no tampering with the honour of the firm to which I belong."</DD>

<DD>
"But what will become of him?" asked Mr. Benson anxiously.</DD>

<DD>
"I do not yet know. But, for Jemima's sake--for his dour old father's sake--I
will not leave him adrift. I will find him some occupation as clear from
temptation as I can. I will do all in my power. And he will do much better,
if he has any good in him, as a freer agent, not cowed by his father into
a want of individuality and self-respect. I believe I must dismiss you,
Mr. Benson," said he, looking at his watch; "I have to explain all to my
wife, and to go to that clerk. You shall hear from me in a day or two."</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Benson half envied the younger man's elasticity of mind, and power
of acting promptly. He himself felt as if he wanted to sit down in his
quiet study, and think over the revelations and events of the last twenty-four
hours. It made him dizzy even to follow Mr. Farquhar's plans, as he had
briefly detailed them; and some solitude and consideration would be required
before Mr. Benson could decide upon their justice and wisdom. He had been
much shocked by the discovery of the overt act of guilt which Richard had
perpetrated, low as his opinion of that young man had been for some time;
and the consequence was, that he felt depressed, and unable to rally for
the next few days. He had not even the comfort of his sister's sympathy,
as he felt bound in honour not to tell her anything; and she was luckily
so much absorbed in some household contest with Sally that she did not
notice her brother's quiet languor.</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Benson felt that he had no right at this time to intrude into the house
which he had been once tacitly forbidden. If he went now to Mr. Bradshaw's
without being asked, or sent for, he thought it would seem like presuming
on his knowledge of the hidden disgrace of one of the family. Yet he longed
to go: he knew that Mr. Farquhar must be writing almost daily to Jemima,
and he wanted to hear what he was doing. The fourth day after her husband's
departure she came, within half-an-hour after the post delivery, and asked
to speak to Mr. Benson alone.</DD>

<DD>
She was in a state of great agitation, and had evidently been crying very
much.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, Mr. Benson!" said she, "will you come with me, and tell papa this
sad news about Dick? Walter has written me a letter at last, to say he
has found him--he could not at first; but now it seems that, the day before
yesterday, he heard of an accident which had happened to the Dover coach;
it was overturned--two passengers killed, and several badly hurt. Walter
says we ought to be thankful, as he is, that Dick was not killed. He says
it was such a relief to him on going to the place--the little inn nearest
to where the coach was overturned--to find that Dick was only severely
injured; not one of those who was killed. But it is a terrible shock to
us all. We had had no more dreadful fear to lessen the shock; mamma is
quite unfit for anything, and we none of us dare to tell papa." Jemima
had hard work to keep down her sobs thus far, and now they overmastered
her.</DD>

<DD>
"How is your father? I have wanted to hear every day," asked Mr. Benson
tenderly.</DD>

<DD>
"It was careless of me not to come and tell you; but, indeed, I have had
so much to do. Mamma would not go near him. He has said something which
she seems as if she could not forgive. Because he came to meals, she would
not. She has almost lived in the nursery; taking out all Dick's old playthings,
and what clothes of his were left, and turning them over, and crying over
them."</DD>

<DD>
"Then Mr. Bradshaw has joined you again; I was afraid, from what Mr. Farquhar
said, he was going to isolate himself from you all?"</DD>

<DD>
"I wish he had," said Jemima, crying afresh. "It would have been more natural
than the way he has gone on; the only difference from his usual habit is,
that he has never gone near the office, or else he has come to meals just
as usual, and talked just as usual; and even done what I never knew him
do before, tried to make jokes--all in order to show us how little he cares."</DD>

<DD>
"Does he not go out at all?"</DD>

<DD>
"Only in the garden. I am sure he does care after all; he must care; he
cannot shake off a child in this way, though he thinks he can; and that
makes me so afraid of telling him of this accident. Will you come, Mr.
Benson?"</DD>

<DD>
He needed no other word. He went with her, as she rapidly threaded her
way through the by-streets. When they reached the house, she went in without
knocking, and, putting her husband's letter into Mr. Benson's hand, she
opened the door of her father's room, and saying--"Papa, here is Mr. Benson,"
left them alone.</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Benson felt nervously incapable of knowing what to do, or to say. He
had surprised Mr. Bradshaw sitting idly over the fire--gazing dreamily
into the embers. But he had started up, and drawn his chair to the table,
on seeing his visitor; and, after the first necessary words of politeness
were over, ho seemed to expect him to open the conversation.</DD>

<DD>
"Mrs. Farquhar has asked me," said Mr. Benson, plunging into the subject
with a trembling heart, "to tell you about a letter she has received from
her husband;" he stopped for an instant, for he felt that he did not get
nearer the real difficulty, and yet could not tell the best way of approaching
it.</DD>

<DD>
"She need not have given you that trouble. I am aware of the reason of
Mr. Farquhar's absence. I entirely disapprove of his conduct. He is regardless
of my wishes; and disobedient to the commands which, as my son-in-law,
I thought he would have felt bound to respect. If there is any more agreeable
subject that you can introduce, I shall be glad to hear you, sir."</DD>

<DD>
"Neither you, nor I, must think of what we like to hear or to say. You
must hear what concerns your son."</DD>

<DD>
"I have disowned the young man who was my son," replied he coldly.</DD>

<DD>
"The Dover coach has been overturned," said Mr. Benson, stimulated into
abruptness by the icy sternness of the father. But, in a flash, he saw
what lay below that terrible assumption of indifference. Mr. Bradshaw glanced
up in his face one look of agony--and then went grey-pale; so livid that
Mr. Benson got up to ring the bell in affright, but Mr. Bradshaw motioned
to him to sit still.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh! I have been too sudden, sir--he is alive, he is alive!" he exclaimed,
as he saw the ashy face working in a vain attempt to speak; but the poor
lips (so wooden, not a minute ago) went working on and on, as if Mr. Benson's
words did not sink down into the mind, or reach the understanding. Mr.
Benson went hastily for Mrs. Farquhar.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, Jemima!" said he, "I have done it so badly--I have been so cruel--he
is very ill, I fear--bring water, brandy----" and he returned with all
speed into the room. Mr. Bradshaw--the great, strong, iron man--lay back
in his chair in a swoon, a fit.</DD>

<DD>
"Fetch my mother, Mary. Send for the doctor, Elizabeth," said Jemima, rushing
to her father. She and Mr. Benson did. all in their power to restore him.
Mrs. Bradshaw forgot all her vows of estrangement from the dead-like husband,
who might never speak to her, or hear her again, and bitterly accused herself
for every angry word she had spoken against him during these last few miserable
days.</DD>

<DD>
Before the doctor came, Mr. Bradshaw had opened his eyes and partially
rallied, although he either did not, or could not speak. He looked struck
down into old age. His eyes were senseless in their expression, but had
the dim glaze of many years of life upon them. His lower jaw fell from
his upper one, giving a look of melancholy depression to the face, although
the lips hid the unclosed teeth. But he answered correctly (in monosyllables,
it is true) all the questions which the doctor chose to ask. And the medical
man was not so much impressed with the serious character of the seizure
as the family, who knew all the hidden mystery behind, and had seen their
father lie for the first time with the precursor aspect of death upon his
face. Rest, watching, and a little medicine, were what the doctor prescribed
it was so slight a prescription, for what had appeared to Mr. Benson so
serious an attack, that he wished to follow the medical man out of the
room to make further inquiries, and learn the real opinion which he thought
must lurk behind. But, as he was following the doctor, he--they all--were
aware of the effort Mr. Bradshaw was making to rise, in order to arrest
Mr. Benson's departure. He did stand up, supporting himself with one hand
on the table, for his legs shook under him. Mr. Benson came back instantly
to the spot where he was. For a moment it seemed as if he had not the right
command of his voice: but at last he said, with a tone of humble, wistful
entreaty, which was very touching--</DD>

<DD>
"He is alive, sir; is he not?"</DD>

<DD>
"Yes, sir--indeed he is; he is only hurt. He is sure to do well. Mr. Farquhar
is with him," said Mr. Benson, almost unable to speak for tears.</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Bradshaw did not remove his eyes from Mr. Benson's face for more than
a minute after his question had been answered. He seemed as though he would
read his very soul, and there see if he spoke the truth. Satisfied at last,
he sank slowly into his chair; and they were silent for a little space,
waiting to perceive if he would wish for any further information just then.
At length he put his hands slowly together in the clasped attitude of prayer,
and said--"Thank God!"</DD>
