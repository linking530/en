So it was that Jemima no longer avoided Ruth, nor manifested by word or
look the dislike which for a long time she had been scarce concealing.
Ruth could not help noticing that Jemima always sought to be in her presence
while she was at Mr. Bradshaw's house; either when daily teaching Mary
and Elizabeth, or when she came as an occasional visitor with Mr. and Miss
Benson, or by herself. Up to this time Jemima had used no gentle skill
to conceal the abruptness with which she would leave the room rather than
that Ruth and she should be brought into contact--rather than that it should
fall to her lot to entertain Ruth during any part of the evening. It was
months since Jemima had left off sitting in the schoolroom, as had been
her wont during the first few years of Ruth's governess-ship. Now, each
morning Miss Bradshaw seated herself at a little round table in the window,
at her work, or at her writing; but, whether she sewed, or wrote, or read,
Ruth felt that she was always watching--watching. At first Ruth had welcomed
all these changes in habit and behaviour, as giving her a chance, she thought,
by some patient waiting or some opportune show of enduring, constant love,
to regain her lost friend's regard; but by-and-by the icy chillness, immovable
and grey, struck more to her heart than many sudden words of unkindness
could have done. They might be attributed to the hot impulses of a hasty
temper--to the vehement anger of an accuser; but this measured manner was
the conscious result of some deep-seated feeling; this cold sternness befitted
the calm implacability of some severe judge. The watching, which Ruth felt
was ever upon her, made her unconsciously shiver, as you would if you saw
that the passionless eyes of the dead were visibly gazing upon you. Her
very being shrivelled and parched up in Jemima's presence, as if blown
upon by a bitter, keen east wind.</DD>

<DD>
Jemima bent every power she possessed upon the one object of ascertaining
what Ruth really was. Sometimes the strain was very painful; the constant
tension made her soul weary; and she moaned aloud, and upbraided circumstance
(she dared not go higher--to the Maker of circumstance) for having deprived
her of her unsuspicious, happy ignorance.</DD>

<DD>
Things were in this state when Mr. Richard Bradshaw came on his annual
home visit. He was to remain another year in London, and then to return
and be admitted into the firm. After he had been a week at home he grew
tired of the monotonous regularity of his father's household, and began
to complain of it to Jemima.</DD>

<DD>
"I wish Farquhar were at home. Though he is such a stiff, quiet old fellow,
his coming in in the evenings makes a change. What has become of the Millses?
They used to drink tea with us sometimes, formerly."</DD>

<DD>
"Oh! papa and Mr. Mills took opposite sides at the election, and we have
never visited since. I don't think they are any great loss."</DD>

<DD>
Anybody is a loss--the stupidest bore that ever was would be a blessing,
if he only would come in sometimes."</DD>

<DD>
"Mr. and Miss Benson have drunk tea here twice since you came."</DD>

<DD>
"Come, that's capital! Apropos of stupid bores, you talk of the Bensons.
I did not think you had so much discrimination, my little sister."</DD>

<DD>
Jemima looked up in surprise; and then reddened angrily.</DD>

<DD>
"I never meant to say a word against Mr. or Miss Benson, and that you know
quite well, Dick."</DD>

<DD>
"Never mind! I won't tell tales. They are stupid old fogeys, but they are
better than nobody, especially as that handsome governess of the girls
always comes with them to be looked at."</DD>

<DD>
There was a little pause; Richard broke it by saying--</DD>

<DD>
"Do you know, Mimie, I've a notion, if she plays her cards well, she may
hook Farquhar!"</DD>

<DD>
"Who?" asked Jemima shortly, though she knew quite well.</DD>

<DD>
"Mrs. Denbigh, to be sure. We were talking of her, you know. Farquhar asked
me to dine with him at his hotel as he passed through town, and--I'd my
own reasons for going and trying to creep up his sleeve--I wanted him to
tip me, as he used to do."</DD>

<DD>
"For shame! Dick," burst in Jemima.</DD>

<DD>
"Well, well! not tip me exactly, but lend me some money. The governor keeps
me deucedly short."</DD>

<DD>
"Why! it was only yesterday, when my father was speaking about your expenses,
and your allowance, I heard you say that you'd more than you knew how to
spend."</DD>

<DD>
"Don't you see that was the perfection of art? If my father had thought
me extravagant, he would have kept me in with a tight rein; as it is, I'm
in great hopes of a handsome addition, and I can tell you it's needed.
If my father had given me what I ought to have had at first, I should not
have been driven to the speculations and messes I've got into."</DD>

<DD>
"What speculations? What messes?" asked Jemima, with anxious eagerness.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh! messes was not the right word. Speculations hardly was; for they are
sure to turn out well, and then I shall surprise my father with my riches."
He saw that he had gone a little too far in his confidence, and was trying
to draw in.</DD>

<DD>
"But what do you mean? Do explain it to me."</DD>

<DD>
"Never you trouble your head about my business, my dear. Women can't understand
the share-market, and such things. Don't think I've forgotten the awful
blunders you made when you tried to read the state of the money-market
aloud to my father that night when he had lost his spectacles. What were
we talking of? Oh! of Farquhar and pretty Mrs. Denbigh. Yes! I soon found
out that was the subject my gentleman liked me to dwell on. He did not
talk about her much himself, but his eyes sparkled when I told him what
enthusiastic letters Polly and Elizabeth wrote about her. How old do you
think she is?"</DD>

<DD>
"I know!" said Jemima. "At least I heard her age spoken about, amongst
other things, when first she came. She will be five-and-twenty this autumn."</DD>

<DD>
"And Farquhar is forty, if he is a day. She's young, too, to have such
a boy as Leonard; younger-looking, or full as young-looking as she is!
I tell you what, Mimie, she looks younger than you. How old are you? Three-and-twenty,
ain't it?"</DD>

<DD>
"Last March," replied Jemima.</DD>

<DD>
"You'll have to make haste and pick up somebody, if you're losing your
good looks at this rate. Why, Jemima, I thought you had a good chance of
Farquhar a year or two ago. How come you to have lost him? I'd far rather
you'd had him than that proud, haughty Mrs. Denbigh, who flashes her great
grey eyes upon me if ever I dare to pay her a compliment. She ought to
think it an honour that I take that much notice of her. Besides, Farquhar
is rich, and it's keeping the business of the firm in one's own family;
and if he marries Mrs. Denbigh she will be sure to be wanting Leonard in
when he's of age, and I won't have that. Have a try for Farquhar, Mimie!
Ten to one it's not too late. I wish I'd brought you a pink bonnet down.
You go about 'so dowdy--so careless of how you look."</DD>

<DD>
"If Mr. Farquhar has not liked me as I am," said Jemima, choking, "I don't
want to owe him to a pink bonnet."</DD>

<DD>
"Nonsense! I don't like to have my sisters' governess stealing a march
on my sister. I tell you Farquhar is worth trying for. If you'll wear the
pink bonnet I'll give it to you, and I'll back you against Mrs. Denbigh.
I think you might have done something with 'our member,' as my father calls
him, when you had him so long in the house. But, altogether, I should like
Farquhar best for a brother-in-law. By the way, have you heard down here
that Donne is going to be married? I heard of it in town, just before I
left, from a man that was good authority. Some Sir Thomas Campbell's seventh
daughter: a girl without a penny; father ruined himself by gambling, and
obliged to live abroad. But Donne is not a man to care for any obstacle,
from all accounts, when once he has taken a fancy. It was love at first
sight, they say. I believe he did not know of her existence a month ago."</DD>

<DD>
"No! we have not heard of it," replied Jemima. "My father will like to
know; tell it him;" continued she, as she was leaving the room, to be alone,
in order to still her habitual agitation whenever she heard Mr. Farquhar
and Ruth coupled together.</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Farquhar came home the day before Richard Bradshaw left for town. He
dropped in after tea at the Bradshaws'; he was evidently disappointed to
see none but the family there, and looked round whenever the door opened.</DD>

<DD>
"Look! look!" said Dick to his sister. "I wanted to make sure of his coming
in to-night, to save me my father's parting exhortations against the temptations
of the world (as if I did not know much more of the world than he does!),
so I used a spell I thought would prove efficacious; I told him that we
should be by ourselves, with the exception of Mrs. Denbigh, and look how
he is expecting her to come in!"</DD>

<DD>
Jemima did see; did understand. She understood, too, why certain packets
were put carefully on one side, apart from the rest of the purchases of
Swiss toys and jewellery, by which Mr. Farquhar proved that none of Mr.
Bradshaw's family had been forgotten by him during his absence. Before
the end of the evening, she was very conscious that her sore heart had
not forgotten how to be jealous. Her brother did not allow a word, a look,
or an incident, which. might be supposed on Mr. Farquhar's side to refer
to Ruth to pass unnoticed; he pointed out all to his sister, never dreaming
of the torture he was inflicting, only anxious to prove his own extreme
penetration. At length Jemima could stand it no longer, and left the room.
She went into the schoolroom, where the shutters were not closed, as it
only looked into the garden. She opened the window, to let the cool night
air blow in on her hot cheeks. The clouds were hurrying over the moon's
face in a tempestuous and unstable manner, making all things seem unreal;
now clear out in its bright light, now trembling and quivering in shadow.
The pain at her heart seemed to make Jemima's brain grow dull; she laid
her head on her arms, which rested on the window-sill, and grew dizzy with
the sick weary notion that the earth was wandering lawless and aimless
through the heavens, where all seemed one tossed and whirling wrack of
clouds. It was a waking nightmare, from the uneasy heaviness of which she
was thankful to be roused by Dick's entrance.</DD>

<DD>
"What, you are here, are you? I have been looking everywhere for you. I
wanted to ask you if you have any spare money you could lend me for a few
weeks?"</DD>

<DD>
"How much do you want?" asked Jemima, in a dull, hopeless voice.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh! the more the better. But I should be glad of any trifle, I am kept
so confoundedly short."</DD>

<DD>
When Jemima returned with her little store, even her careless, selfish
brother was struck by the wanness of her face, lighted by the bed-candle
she carried.</DD>

<DD>
"Come, Mimie, don't give it up. If I were you, I would have a good try
against Mrs. Denbigh. I'll send you the bonnet as soon as ever I get back
to town, and you pluck up a spirit, and I'll back you against her even
yet."</DD>

<DD>
It seemed to Jemima strange--and yet only a fitting part of this strange,
chaotic world--to find that her brother, who was the last person to whom
she could have given her confidence in her own family, and almost the last
person of her acquaintance to whom she could look for real help and sympathy,
should have been the only one to hit upon the secret of her love. And the
idea passed away from his mind as quickly as all ideas not bearing upon
his own self-interests did.</DD>

<DD>
The night, the sleepless night, was so crowded and haunted by miserable
images, that she longed for day; and when day came, with its stinging realities,
she wearied and grew sick for the solitude of night. For the next week,
she seemed to see and hear nothing but what confirmed the idea of Mr. Farquhar's
decided attachment to Ruth. Even her mother spoke of it as a thing which
was impending, and which she wondered how Mr. Bradshaw would like; for
his approval or disapproval was the standard by which she measured all
things.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh! merciful God," prayed Jemima, in the dead silence of the night, "the
strain is too great--I cannot bear it longer--my life--my love--the very
essence of me, which is myself through time and eternity; and on the other
side there is all-pitying Charity. If she had not been what she is--if
she had shown any sign of triumph--any knowledge of her prize--if she had
made any effort to gain his dear heart, I must have given way long ago,
and taunted her, even if I did not tell others--taunted her, even though
I sank down to the pit the next moment.</DD>

<DD>
"The temptation is too strong for me. O Lord! where is Thy peace that I
believed in, in my childhood?--that I hear people speaking of now as if
it hushed up the troubles of life, and had not to be sought for--sought
for, as with tears of blood!"</DD>

<DD>
There was no sound nor answer to this wild imploring cry, which Jemima
half thought must force out a sign from Heaven. But there was a dawn stealing
on through the darkness of her night.</DD>

<DD>
It was glorious weather for the end of August. The nights were as full
of light as the days--everywhere, save in the low dusky meadows by the
river-side, where the mists rose and blended the pale sky with the lands
below. Unknowing of the care and trouble around them, Mary and Elizabeth
exulted in the weather, and saw some new glory in every touch of the year's
decay. They were clamorous for an expedition to the hills, before the calm
stillness of the autumn should be disturbed by storms. They gained permission
to go on the next Wednesday--the next half-holiday. They had won their
mother over to consent to a full holiday, but their father would not hear
of it. Mrs. Bradshaw had proposed an early dinner, but the idea was scouted
at by the girls. What would the expedition be worth if they did not carry
their dinners with them in baskets? Anything out of a basket, and eaten
in the open air, was worth twenty times as much as the most sumptuous meal
in the house. So the baskets were packed up, while Mrs. Bradshaw wailed
over probable colds to be caught from sitting on the damp ground. Ruth
and Leonard were to go they four. Jemima had refused all invitations to
make one of the party; and yet she had a half-sympathy with her sisters'
joy--a sort of longing, lingering look back to the time when she too would
have revelled in the prospect that lay before them. They, too, would grow
up, and suffer; though now they played, regardless of their doom.</DD>

<DD>
The morning was bright and glorious; just cloud enough, as some one said,
to make the distant plain look beautiful from the hills, with its floating
shadows passing over the golden corn-fields. Leonard was to join them at
twelve, when his lessons with Mr. Benson, and the girls' with their masters,
should be over. Ruth took off her bonnet, and folded her shawl with her
usual dainty, careful neatness, and laid them aside in a corner of the
room to be in readiness. She tried to forget the pleasure she always anticipated
from a long walk towards the hills while the morning's work went on; but
she showed enough of sympathy to make the girls cling round her with many
a caress of joyous love. Everything was beautiful in their eyes; from the
shadows of the quivering leaves on the wall to the glittering beads of
dew, not yet absorbed by the sun, which decked the gossamer web in the
vine outside the window. Eleven o'clock struck. The Latin master went away,
wondering much at the radiant faces of his pupils, and thinking that it
was only very young people who could take such pleasure in the "Delectus."
Ruth said, "Now do let us try to be very steady this next hour," and Mary
pulled back Ruth's head, and gave the pretty budding mouth a kiss. They
sat down to work, while Mrs. Denbigh read aloud. A fresh sun-gleam burst
into the room, and they looked at each other with glad, anticipating eyes.</DD>

<DD>
Jemima came in, ostensibly to seek for a book, but really from that sort
of restless weariness of any one place or employment which had taken possession
of her since Mr. Farquhar's return. She stood before the bookcase in the
recess, languidly passing over the titles in search of the one she wanted.
Ruth's voice lost a tone or two of its peacefulness, and her eyes looked
more dim and anxious at Jemima's presence. She wondered in her heart if
she dared to ask Miss Bradshaw to accompanying them in their expedition.
Eighteen months ago she would have urged it on her friend with soft, loving
entreaty; now she was afraid even to propose it as a hard possibility;
everything she did or said was taken so wrongly--seemed to add to the old
dislike, or the later stony contempt with which Miss Bradshaw had regarded
her. While they were in this way Mr. Bradshaw came into the room. His entrance--his
being at home at all at this time--was so unusual a thing, that the reading
was instantly stopped; and all four involuntarily looked at him, as if
expecting some explanation of his unusual proceeding.</DD>

<DD>
His face was almost purple with suppressed agitation.</DD>

<DD>
"Mary and Elizabeth, leave the room. Don't stay to pack up your books.
Leave the room, I say!" He spoke with trembling anger, and the frightened
girls obeyed without a won A cloud passing over the sun cast a cold gloom
into the room which was late so bright and beaming; but, by equalising
the light, it took away the dark shadow from the place where Jemima had
been standing, and her figure caught her father's eye.</DD>

<DD>
"Leave the room, Jemima," said he.</DD>

<DD>
"Why, father?" replied she, in an opposition that was strange even to herself,
but which was prompted by the sullen passion which seethed below the stagnant
surface of her life, and which sought a vent in defiance. She maintained
her ground, facing round upon her father, and Ruth--Ruth, who had risen,
and stood trembling, shaking, a lightning-fear having shown her the precipice
on which she stood. It was of no use; no quiet, innocent life--no profound
silence, even to her own heart, as to the Past; the old offence could never
be drowned in the Deep; but thus, when all was calm on the great, broad,
sunny sea, it rose to the surface, and faced her with its unclosed eyes
and its ghastly countenance. The blood bubbled up to her brain, and made
such a sound there, as of boiling waters, that she did not hear the words
which Mr. Bradshaw first spoke; indeed, his speech was broken and disjointed
by intense passion. But she needed not to hear; she knew. As she rose up
at first, so she stood now--numb and helpless. When her ears heard again
(as if the sounds were drawing nearer, and becoming more distinct, from
some faint, vague distance of space), Mr. Bradshaw was saying, "If there
be one sin I hate--I utterly loathe--more than all others, it is wantonness.
It includes all other sins. It is but of a piece that you should have come
with your sickly, hypocritical face imposing upon us all. I trust Benson
did not know of it--for his own sake, I trust not. Before God, if he got
you into my house on false pretences, he shall find his charity at other
men's expense shall cost him dear--you--the common talk of Eccleston for
your profligacy----" He was absolutely choked by his boiling indignation.
Ruth stood speechless, motionless. Her head drooped a little forward; her
eyes were more than half veiled by the large quivering lids; her arms hung
down straight and heavy. At last she heaved the weight off her heart enough
to say, in a faint, moaning voice, speaking with infinite difficulty--</DD>

<DD>
"I was so young."</DD>

<DD>
"The more depraved, the more disgusting you," Mr. Bradshaw exclaimed, almost
glad that the woman, unresisting so long, should now begin to resist. But,
to his surprise (for in his anger he had forgotten her presence), Jemima
moved forwards and said, "Father!"</DD>

<DD>
"You hold your tongue, Jemima. You have grown more and more insolent--more
and more disobedient every day. I now know who to thank for it. When such
a woman came into my family there is no wonder at any corruption--any evil--any
defilement----"</DD>

<DD>
"Father!"</DD>

<DD>
"Not a word! If, in your disobedience, you choose to stay and hear what
no modest young woman would put herself in the way of hearing, you shall
be silent when I bid you. The only good you can gain is in the way of warning.
Look at that woman" (indicating Ruth, who moved her drooping head a little
on one side, as if by such motion she could avert the pitiless pointing--her
face growing whiter and whiter still every instant)--"Look at that woman,
I say--corrupt long before she was your age--hypocrite for years! If ever
you, or any child of mine, cared for her, shake her off from you, as St.
Paul shook off the viper--even into the fire." He stopped for very want
of breath. Jemima, all flushed and panting, went up and stood side by side
with wan Ruth. She took the cold, dead hand which hung next to her in her
warm convulsive grasp, and, holding it so tight that it was blue and discoloured
for days, she spoke out beyond all power of restraint from her father.</DD>

<DD>
"Father! I will speak. I will not keep silence. I will bear witness to
Ruth. I have hated her--so keenly, may God forgive me I but you may know,
from that, that my witness is true. I have hated her, and my hatred was
only quenched into contempt--not contempt now, dear Ruth--dear Ruth"--(this
was spoken with infinite softness and tenderness, and in spite of her father's
fierce eyes and passionate gesture)--"I heard what you have learnt now,
father, weeks and weeks ago--a year it may be, all time of late has been
so long; and I shuddered up from her and from her sin; and I might have
spoken of it, and told it there and then, if I had not been afraid that
it was from no good motive I should act in so doing, but to gain a way
to the desire of my own jealous heart. Yes, father, to show you what a
witness I am for Ruth, I will own that I was stabbed to the heart with
jealousy; some one--some one cared for Ruth that--oh father! spare me saying
all." Her face was double-dyed with crimson blushes, and she paused for
one moment--no more.</DD>

<DD>
"I watched her, and I watched her with my wild-beast eyes. If I had seen
one paltering with duty--if I had witnessed one flickering shadow of untruth
in word or action--if, more than all things, my woman's instinct had ever
been conscious of the faintest speck of impurity in thought, or word, or
look, my old hate would have flamed out with the flame of hell! my contempt
would have turned to loathing disgust, instead of my being full of pity,
and the stirrings of new-awakened love, and most true respect. Father,
I have borne my witness!"</DD>

<DD>
"And I will tell you how much your witness is worth," said her father,
beginning low, that his pent-up wrath might have room to swell out. "It
only convinces me more and more how deep is the corruption this wanton
has spread in my family. She has come amongst us with her innocent seeming,
and spread her nets well and skilfully. She has turned right into wrong,
and wrong into right, and taught you all to be uncertain whether there
be any such thing as Vice in the world, or whether it ought not to be looked
upon as Virtue. She has led you to the brink of the deep pit, ready for
the first chance circumstance to push you in. And I trusted--I trusted
her--I welcomed her."</DD>

<DD>
"I have done very wrong," murmured Ruth, but so low, that perhaps he did
not hear her, for he went on lashing himself up.</DD>

<DD>
"I welcomed her. I was duped into allowing her bastard--(I sicken at the
thought of it)----"</DD>

<DD>
At the mention of Leonard, Ruth lifted up her eyes for the first time since
the conversation began, the pupils dilating, as if she were just becoming
aware of some new agony in store for her. I have seen such a look of terror
on a poor dumb animal's countenance, and once or twice on human faces;
I pray I may never see it again on either! Jemima felt the hand she held
in her strong grasp writhe itself free. Ruth spread her arms before her,
clasping and lacing her fingers together, her head thrown a little back
as if in intensest suffering.</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Bradshaw went on--</DD>

<DD>
"That very child and heir of shame to associate with my own innocent children!
I trust they are not contaminated."</DD>

<DD>
"I cannot bear it--I cannot bear it!" were the words wrung out of Ruth.</DD>

<DD>
"Cannot bear it! cannot bear it!" he repeated. "You must bear it, madam.
Do you suppose your child is to be exempt from the penalties of his birth?
Do you suppose that he alone is to be saved from the upbraiding scoff?
Do you suppose that he is ever to rank with other boys, who are not stained
and marked with sin from their birth? Every creature in Eccleston may know
what he is; do you think they will spare him their scorn? 'Cannot bear
it,' indeed! Before you went into your sin, you should have thought whether
you could bear the consequences or not--have had some idea how far your
offspring would be degraded and scouted, till the best thing that could
happen to him would be for him to be lost to all sense of shame, dead to
all knowledge of guilt, for his mother's sake."</DD>

<DD>
Ruth spoke out. She stood like a wild creature at bay, past fear now. "I
appeal to God against such a doom for my child. I appeal to God to help
me. I am a mother, and as such I cry to God for help--for help to keep
my boy in His pitying sight, and to bring him up in His holy fear. Let
the shame fall on me! I have deserved it, but he--he is so innocent and
good."</DD>

<DD>
Ruth had caught up her shawl, and was tying on her bonnet with her trembling
hands. What if Leonard was hearing of her shame from common report? What
would be the mysterious shock of the intelligence? She must face him, and
see the look in his eyes, before she knew whether he recoiled from her;
he might have his heart turned to hate her, by their cruel jeers.</DD>

<DD>
Jemima stood by, dumb and pitying. Her sorrow was past her power. She helped
in arranging the dress, with one or two gentle touches, which were hardly
felt by Ruth, but which called out all Mr. Bradshaw's ire afresh; he absolutely
took her by the shoulders and turned her by force out of the room. In the
hall, and along the stairs, her passionate woeful crying was heard. The
sound only concentrated Mr. Bradshaw's anger on Ruth. He held the street-door
open wide, and said, between his teeth, "If ever you, or your bastard,
darken this door again, I will have you both turned out by the police!"</DD>

<DD>
He needed not have added this if he had seen Ruth's face.</DD>
