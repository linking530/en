"HE will take him away from me! He will take the child from me!"</DD>

<DD>
These words rang like a tolling bell through Ruth's head. It seemed to
her that her doom was certain. Leonard would be taken from her. She had
a firm conviction--not the less firm because she knew not on what it was
based--that a child, whether legitimate or not, belonged of legal right
to the father. And Leonard, of all children, was the prince mind monarch.
Every man's heart would long to call Leonard "Child!" She had been too
strongly taxed to have much power left her to reason coolly and dispassionately,
just then, even if she had been with any one who could furnish her with
information from which to draw correct conclusions. The one thought haunted
her night and day--"He will take my child away from me!" In her dreams
she saw Leonard borne away into some dim land, to which she could not follow.
Sometimes he sat in a swiftly-moving carriage, at his father's side, and
smiled on her as he passed by, as if going to promised pleasure. At another
time he was struggling to return to her; stretching out his little arms,
and crying to her for the help she could not give. How she got through
the days she did not know; her body moved about and habitually acted, but
her spirit was with her child. She thought often of writing and warning
Mr. Benson of Leonard's danger; but then she shrank from recurring to circumstances
all mention of which had ceased years ago; the very recollection of which
seemed buried deep for ever. Besides, she feared occasioning discord or
commotion in the quiet circle in which she lived. Mr. Benson's deep anger
against her betrayer had been shown too clearly in the old time to allow
her to think that he would keep it down without expression now. He would
cease to do anything to forward his election he would oppose him as much
as he could; and Mr. Bradshaw would be angry, and a storm would arise,
from the bare thought of which Ruth shrank with the cowardliness of a person
thoroughly worn out with late contest. She was bodily wearied with her
spiritual buffeting.</DD>

<DD>
One morning, three or four days after their departure, she received a letter
from Miss Benson. She could not open it at first, and put it on one side,
clenching her hands over it all the time. At last she tore it open. Leopard
was safe as yet. There were a few lines in his great round hand, speaking
of events no larger than the loss of a beautiful "alley." There was a sheet
from Miss Benson. She always wrote letters in the manner of a diary. "Monday
we did so-and-so; Tuesday, so-and-so, &amp;c." Ruth glanced rapidly down
the pages. Yes, here it was! Sick, fluttering heart, be still!</DD>

<DD>
"In the middle of the damsons, when they were just on the fire, there was
a knock at the door. My brother was out, and Sally was washing up, and
I was stirring the preserve with my great apron and bib on; so I bade Leonard
come in from the garden and open the door. But I would have washed his
face first if I had known who it was! It was Mr. Bradshaw and the Mr. Donne
that they hope to send up to the House of Commons, as member of Parliament
for Eccleston, and another gentleman, whose name I never heard. They had
come canvassing; and when they found my brother was out, they asked Leonard
if they could see me. The child said, 'Yes! if I could leave the damsons;'
and straightway came to call me, leaving them standing in the passage.
I whipped off my apron, and took Leonard by the hand, for I fancied I should
feel less awkward if he was with me; and then I went and asked them all
into the study, for I thought I should like them to see how many books
Thurstan had got. Then they began talking politics at me in a very polite
manner, only I could not make head or tail of what they meant; and Mr.
Donne took a deal of notice of Leonard, and called him to him; and I am
sure he noticed what a noble, handsome boy he was, though his face was
very brown and red, and hot with digging, and his curls all tangled. Leonard
talked back as if he had known him all his life, till, I think Mr. Bradshaw
thought he was making too much noise, and bid him remember he ought to
be seen, not heard. So he stood as still and stiff as a soldier, close
to Mr. Donne; and as I could not help looking at the two, and thinking
how handsome they both were in their different ways, I could not tell Thurstan
half the messages the gentlemen left for him. But there was one thing more
I must tell you, though I said I would not. When Mr. Donne was talking
to Leonard, he took off his watch and chain and put it round the boy's
neck, who was pleased enough, you may be sure. I bade him give it back
to the gentleman, when they were all going away; and I was quite surprised,
and very uncomfortable, when Mr. Donne said he had given it to Leonard,
and that he was to keep it for his own. I could see Mr. Bradshaw was annoyed,
and he and the other gentleman spoke to Mr. Donne, and I heard them say,
'too barefaced;' and I shall never forget Mr. Donne's proud, stubborn look
back at them, nor his way of saying, 'I allow no one to interfere with
what I choose to do with my own.' And he looked so haughty and displeased,
I durst say nothing at the time. But when I told Thurstan, he was very
grieved and angry; and said he had heard that our party were bribing, but
that he never could have thought they would have tried to do it at his
house. Thurstan is very much out of spirits about this election altogether;
and, indeed, it does make sad work up and down the town. However, he sent
back the watch, with a letter to Mr. Bradshaw; and Leonard was very good
about it, so I gave him a taste of the new damson-preserve on his bread
for supper."</DD>

<DD>
Although a stranger might have considered this letter wearisome, from the
multiplicity of the details, Ruth craved greedily after more. What had
Mr. Donne said to Leonard? Had Leonard liked his new acquaintance? Were
they likely to meet again? After wondering and wondering over these points,
Ruth composed herself by the hope that in a day or two she should hear
again; and, to secure this end, she answered the letters by return of post.
That was on Thursday. On Friday she had another letter, in a strange hand.
It was from Mr. Donne. No name, no initials were given. If it had fallen
into another person's hands, they could not have recognised the writer,
nor guessed to whom it was sent. It contained simply these words:--</DD>

<DD>
"For our child's sake, and in his name, I summon you to appoint a place
where I can speak, and you can listen, undisturbed. The time must be on
Sunday; the limit of distance may be the circumference of your power of
walking. My words may be commands, but my fond heart entreats. More I shall
not say now, but, remember! your boy's welfare depends on your acceding
to this request. Address B. D., Post-Office, Eccleston."</DD>

<DD>
Ruth did not attempt to answer this letter till the last five minutes before
the post went out. She could not decide until forced to it. Either way
she dreaded. She was very nearly leaving the letter altogether unanswered.
But suddenly she resolved she would know all, the best, the worst. No cowardly
dread of herself, or of others, should make her neglect aught that came
to her in her child's name. She took up a pen and wrote--</DD>

<DD>
"The sands below the rocks, where we met you the other night. Time, afternoon
church."</DD>

<DD>
Sunday came.</DD>

<DD>
"I shall not go to church this afternoon. You know the way, of course;
and I trust you to go steadily by yourselves."</DD>

<DD>
When they came to kiss her before leaving her, according to their fond
wont, they were struck by the coldness of her face and lips.</DD>

<DD>
"Are you not well, dear Mrs. Denbigh? How cold you are!"</DD>

<DD>
"Yes, darling! I am well;" and tears sprang into her eyes as she looked
at their anxious little faces. "Go now, dears. Five o'clock will soon be
here, and then we will have tea."</DD>

<DD>
"And that will warm you!" said they, leaving the room.</DD>

<DD>
"And then it will be over," she murmured--"over."</DD>

<DD>
It never came into her head to watch the girls as they disappeared down
the lane on their way to church. She knew them too well to distrust their
doing what they were told. She sat still, her head bowed on her arms for
a few minutes, and then rose up and went to put on her walking things.
Some thoughts impelled her to sudden haste. She crossed the field by the
side of the house, ran down the steep and rocky path, and was carried by
the impetus of her descent far out on the level sands--but not far enough
for her intent. Without looking to the right hand or to the left, where
comers might be seen,. she went forwards to the black posts, which, rising
above the heaving waters, marked where the fishermen's nets were laid.
She went straight towards this place, and hardly stinted her pace even
where the wet sands were glittering with the receding waves. Once there,
she turned round, and, in a darting glance, saw that as yet no one was
near. She was perhaps half-a-mile or more from the grey, silvery rocks,
which sloped away into brown moorland, interspersed with a field here and
there of golden, waving corn. Behind were purple hills, with sharp, clear
outlines, touching the sky. A little on one side from where she stood she
saw the white cottages and houses which formed the village of Abermouth,
scattered up and down; and, on a windy hill, about a mile inland, she saw
the little grey church, where even now many were worshipping in peace.</DD>

<DD>
"Pray for me!" she sighed out as this object caught her eye.</DD>

<DD>
And now, close under the heathery fields, where they fell softly down and
touched the sands, she saw a figure moving in the direction of the great
shadow made by the rocks--going towards the very point where the path from
Eagle's Crag came down to the shore.</DD>

<DD>
"It is he!" said she to herself. And she turned round and looked seaward.
The tide had turned; the waves were slowly receding, as if loth to lose
the hold they had, so lately, and with such swift bounds, gained on the
yellow sands. The eternal moan they have made since the world began filled
the ear, broken only by the skirl of the grey sea-birds as they alighted
in groups on the edge of the waters, or as they rose up with their measured,
balancing motion, and the sunlight caught their white breasts. There was
no sign of human life to be seen; no boat, or distant sail, or near shrimper.
The black posts there were all that spoke of men's work or labour. Beyond
a stretch of the waters, a few pale grey hills showed like films; their
summits clear, though faint, their bases lost in a vapoury mist.</DD>

<DD>
On the hard, echoing sands, and distinct from the ceaseless murmur of the
salt sea waves, came footsteps--nearer--nearer. Very near they were when
Ruth, unwilling to show the fear that rioted in her heart, turned round,
and faced Mr. Donne.</DD>

<DD>
He came forward, with both hands extended.</DD>

<DD>
"This is kind! my own Ruth," said he. Ruth's arms hung down motionless
at her sides.</DD>

<DD>
"What! Ruth, have you no word for me?"</DD>

<DD>
"I have nothing to say," said Ruth.</DD>

<DD>
"Why, you little revengeful creature! And so I am to explain all, before
you will even treat me with decent civility."</DD>

<DD>
"I do not want explanations," said Ruth in a trembling tone. "We must not
speak of the past. You asked me to come in Leonard's--in my child's name,
and to hear what you had to say about him."</DD>

<DD>
"But what I have to say about him relates to you even more. And how can
we talk about him without recurring to the past? That past, which you try
to ignore--I know you cannot do it in your heart--is full of happy recollections
to me. Were you not happy in Wales?" he said in his tenderest tone.</DD>

<DD>
But there was no answer; not even one faint sigh, though he listened intently.</DD>

<DD>
"You dare not speak; you dare not answer me. Your heart will not allow
you to prevaricate, and you know you were happy."</DD>

<DD>
Suddenly Ruth's beautiful eyes were raised to him, full of lucid splendour,
but grave and serious in their expression; and her cheeks, heretofore so
faintly tinged with the tenderest blush, flashed into a ruddy glow.</DD>

<DD>
"I was happy. I do not deny it. Whatever comes, I will not blench from
the truth. I have answered you."</DD>

<DD>
"And yet," replied he, secretly exulting in her admission, and not perceiving
the inner strength of which she must have been conscious before she would
have dared to make it--"and yet, Ruth, we are not to recur to the past!
Why not? If it was happy at the time, is the recollection of it so miserable
to you?"</DD>

<DD>
He tried once more to take her hand, but she quietly stepped back.</DD>

<DD>
"I came to hear what you had to say about my child," said she, beginning
to feel very weary.</DD>

<DD>
"<I>Our</I> child, Ruth."</DD>

<DD>
She drew herself up, and her face went very pale.</DD>

<DD>
"What have you to say about him?" asked she coldly.</DD>

<DD>
"Much," exclaimed he--"much that may affect his whole life. But it all
depends upon whether you will hear me or not."</DD>

<DD>
"I listen."</DD>

<DD>
"Good heavens! Ruth, you will drive me mad. Oh! what a changed person you
are from the sweet, loving creature you were! I wish you were not so beautiful."
She did not reply, but he caught a deep, involuntary sigh.</DD>

<DD>
"Will you hear me if I speak, though I may not begin all at once to talk
of this boy--a boy of whom any mother--any parent, might be proud? I could
see that, Ruth. I have seen him; he looked like a prince in that cramped,
miserable house, and with no earthly advantages. It is a shame he should
not have every kind of opportunity laid open before him."</DD>

<DD>
There was no sign of maternal ambition on the motionless face, though there
might be some little spring in her heart, as it beat quick and strong at
the idea of the proposal she imagined he was going to make of taking her
boy away to give him the careful education she had often craved for him.
She should refuse it, as she would everything else which seemed to imply
that she acknowledged a claim over Leonard; but yet sometimes, for her
boy's sake, she had longed for a larger opening--a more extended sphere.</DD>

<DD>
"Ruth! you acknowledge we were happy once;--there were circumstances which,
if I could tell you them all in detail, would show you how, in my weak,
convalescent state, I was almost passive in the hands of others. Ah, Ruth!
I have not forgotten the tender nurse who soothed me in my delirium. When
I am feverish, I dream that I am again at Llan-dhu, in the little old bedchamber,
and you, in white--which you always wore then, you know--flitting about
me."</DD>

<DD>
The tears dropped, large and round from Ruth's eyes--she could not help
it--how could she?</DD>

<DD>
"We were happy then," continued he, gaining confidence from the sight of
her melted mood, and recurring once more to the admission which he considered
so much in his favour. "Can such happiness never return?" Thus he went
on, quickly, anxious to lay before her all he had to offer, before she
should fully understand his meaning.</DD>

<DD>
"If you would consent, Leonard should be always with you--educated where
and how you liked--money to any amount you might choose to name should
be secured to you and him--if only, Ruth--if only those happy days might
return."</DD>

<DD>
Ruth spoke--</DD>

<DD>
"I said that I was happy, because I had asked God to protect and help me--and
I dared not tell a lie. I was happy. Oh! what is happiness or misery that
we should talk about them now?"</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Donne looked at her, as she uttered these words, to see if she was
wandering in her mind, they seemed to him so utterly strange and incoherent.</DD>

<DD>
"I dare not think of happiness--I must not look forward to sorrow. God
did not put me here to consider either of these things."</DD>

<DD>
"My dear Ruth, compose yourself! There is no hurry in answering the question
I asked."</DD>

<DD>
"What was it?" said Ruth.</DD>

<DD>
"I love you so, I cannot live without you. I offer you my heart, my life--I
offer to place Leonard wherever you would have him placed. I have the power
and the means to advance him in any path of life you choose. All who have
shown kindness to you shall be rewarded by me, with a gratitude even surpassing
your own. If there is anything else I can do that you can suggest, I will
do it."</DD>

<DD>
"Listen to me!" said Ruth, now that the idea of what he proposed had entered
her mind. "When I said that I was happy with you long ago, I was choked
with shame as I said it. And yet it may be a vain, false excuse that I
make for myself. I was very young; I did not know how such a life was against
God's pure and holy will--at least, not as I know it now; and I tell you
the truth--all the days of my years since I have gone about with a stain
on my hidden soul--a stain which made me loathe myself, and envy those
who stood spotless and undefiled; which made me shrink from my child--from
Mr. Benson, from his sister, from the innocent girls whom I teach--nay,
even I have cowered away from God Himself; and what I did wrong then, I
did blindly to what I should do now if I listened to you."</DD>

<DD>
She was so strongly agitated that she put her hands over her face, and
sobbed without restraint. Then, taking them away, she looked at him with
a glowing face, and beautiful, honest, wet eyes, and tried to speak calmly,
as she asked if she needed to stay longer (she would have gone away at
once but that she thought of Leonard, and wished to hear all that his father
might have to say). He was so struck anew by her beauty, and understood
her so little, that he believed that she only required a little more urging
to consent to what he wished; for in all she had said there was no trace
of the anger and resentment for his desertion of her, which he had expected
would be a prominent feature--the greatest obstacle he had to encounter.
The deep sense of penitence she expressed he mistook for earthly shame;
which he imagined he could soon soothe away.</DD>

<DD>
"Yes, I have much more to say. I have not said half. I cannot tell you
how fondly I will--how fondly I do love you--how my life shall be spent
in ministering to your wishes. Money, I see--I know, you despise----"</DD>

<DD>
"Mr. Bellingham! I will not stay to hear you speak to me so' again. I have
been sinful, but it is not you who should----" She could not speak, she
was so choking with passionate sorrow.</DD>

<DD>
He wanted to calm her, as he saw her shaken with repressed sobs. He put
his hand on her arm. She shook it off impatiently, and moved away in an
instant.</DD>

<DD>
"Ruth!" said he, nettled by her action of repugnance, "I begin to think
you never loved me."</DD>

<DD>
"I!--I never loved you! Do you dare to say so?"</DD>

<DD>
Her eyes flamed on him as she spoke. Her red, round lip curled into beautiful
contempt.</DD>

<DD>
"Why do you shrink so from me?" said he, in his turn getting impatient.</DD>

<DD>
"I did not come here to be spoken to in this way," said she. "I came, if
by any chance I could do Leonard good. I would submit to many humiliations
for his sake--but to no more from you."</DD>

<DD>
"Are not you afraid to brave me so?" said he. "Don't you know how much
you are in my power?"</DD>

<DD>
She was silent. She longed to go away, but dreaded lest he should follow
her, where she might be less subject to interruption than she was here--near
the fisherman's nets, which the receding tide was leaving every moment
barer and more bare, and the posts they were fastened to more blackly uprising
above the waters.</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Donne put his hands on her arms as they hung down before her--her hands
tightly clasped together.</DD>

<DD>
"Ask me to let you go," said he. "I will, if you will ask me. He looked
very fierce and passionate and determined. The vehemence of his action
took Ruth by surprise, and the painful tightness of the grasp almost made
her exclaim. But she was quite still and mute.</DD>

<DD>
"Ask me," said he, giving her a little shake. She did not speak. Her eyes,
fixed on the distant shore, were slowly filling with tears. Suddenly a
light came through the mist that obscured them, and the shut lips parted.
She saw some distant object that gave her hope.</DD>

<DD>
"It is Stephen Bromley," said she. "He is coming to his nets. They say
he is a very desperate, violent man, but he will protect me."</DD>

<DD>
"You obstinate, wilful creature!" said Mr. Donne, releasing his grasp.
"You forget that one word of mine could undeceive all these good people
at Eccleston; and that if I spoke out ever so little, they would throw
you off in an instant. Now!" he continued, "do you understand how much
you are in my power?"</DD>

<DD>
"Mr. and Miss Benson know all--they have not thrown me off," Ruth gasped
out. "Oh! for Leonard's sake! you would not be so cruel."</DD>

<DD>
"Then do not be cruel to him--to me. Think once more!"</DD>

<DD>
"I think once more." She spoke solemnly. "To save Leonard from the shame
and agony of knowing my disgrace I would lay down and die. Oh! perhaps
it would be best for him--for me, if I might; my death would be a stingless
grief--but to go back into sin would be the real cruelty to him The errors
of my youth may, be washed away by my tears--it was so once when the gentle,
blessed Christ was upon earth; but now, if I went into wilful guilt, as
you would have me, how could I teach Leonard God's holy will? I should
not mind his knowing my past sin, compared to the awful corruption it would
be if he knew me living now, as you would have me, lost to all fear of
God----" Her speech was broken by sobs. "Whatever may be my doom--God is
just--I leave myself in His hands. I will save Leonard from evil. Evil
would it be for him if I lived with you. I will let him die first!" She
lifted her eyes to heaven, and clasped and wreathed her hands together
tight. Then she said "You have humbled me enough, sir. I shall leave you
now."</DD>

<DD>
She turned away resolutely. The dark, grey fisherman was at hand. Mr. Donne
folded his arms and set his teeth, and. looked after her.</DD>

<DD>
"What a stately step she has! How majestic and graceful all her attitudes
were! She thinks she has baffled me now. We will try something more, and
bid a higher price." He unfolded his arms, and began to follow her. He
gained upon her, for her beautiful walk was now wavering and unsteady.
The works which had kept her in motion were running down fast.</DD>

<DD>
"Ruth!" said he, overtaking her. "You shall hear me once more. Ay, look
round! Your fisherman is near. He may hear me, if he chooses--hear your
triumph. I am come to. offer to marry you, Ruth; come what may, I will
have you. Nay--I will make you hear me. I will hold this hand till you
have heard me. To-morrow I will speak to any one in Eccleston you like--to
Mr. Bradshaw; Mr. ----, the little minister I mean. We can make it worth
while for him to keep our secret, and no one else need know but what you
are really Mrs. Denbigh. Leonard shall still bear this name, but in all
things else he shall be treated as my son. He and you would grace any situation.
I will take care the highest paths are open to him!"</DD>

<DD>
He looked to see the lovely face brighten into sudden joy; on the contrary,
the head was still hung down with a heavy droop.</DD>

<DD>
"I cannot," said she; her voice was very faint and low.</DD>

<DD>
"It is sudden for you, my dearest. But be calm. It will all be easily managed.
Leave it to me."</DD>

<DD>
"I cannot," repeated she, more distinct and clear, though still very low.</DD>

<DD>
"Why! what on earth makes you say that?" asked he, in a mood to be irritated
by any repetition of such words.</DD>

<DD>
"I do not love you. I did once. Don't say I did not love you then! but
I do not now. I could never love you again. All you have said and done
since you came with Mr. Bradshaw to Abermouth first has only made me wonder
how I ever could have loved you. We are very far apart. The time that has
pressed down my life like brands of hot iron, and scarred me for ever,
has been nothing to you. You have talked of it with no sound of moaning
in your voice--no shadow over the brightness of your face; it has left
no sense of sin on your conscience, while me it haunts and haunts; and
yet I might plead that I was an ignorant child--only I will not plead anything,
for God knows all---- But this is only one piece of our great difference----"</DD>

<DD>
"You mean that I am no saint," he said, impatient at her speech. "Granted.
But people who are no saints have made very good husbands before now. Come,
don't let any morbid, overstrained conscientiousness interfere with substantial
happiness--both to you and to me--for I am sure I can make you happy--ay!
and make you love me, too, in spite of your pretty defiance. I love you
so dearly, I must win love back. And here are advantages for Leonard, to
be gained by you quite in a holy and legitimate way."</DD>

<DD>
She stood very erect.</DD>

<DD>
"If there was one thing needed to confirm me, you have named it. You shall
have nothing to do with my boy, by my consent, much less by my agency.
I would rather see him working on the roadside than leading such a life--being
such a one as you are. You have heard my mind now, Mr. Bellingham. You
have humbled me--you have baited me; and if at last I have spoken out too
harshly, and too much in a spirit of judgment, the fault is yours. If there
were no other reason to prevent our marriage but the one fact that it would
bring Leonard into contact with you, that would be enough."</DD>

<DD>
"It is enough!" said he, making her a low bow. "Neither you nor your child
shall ever more be annoyed by me. I wish you a good evening."</DD>

<DD>
They walked apart--he back to. the inn, to set off instantly, while the
blood was hot within him, from the place where he had been so mortified--she
to steady herself along till she reached the little path, more like a rude
staircase than anything else, by which she had to climb to the house.</DD>

<DD>
She did not turn round for some time after she was fairly lost to the sight
of any one on the shore; she clambered on, almost stunned by the rapid
beating of her heart. Her eyes were hot and dry; and at last became as
if she were suddenly blind. Unable to go on, she tottered into the tangled
underwood which grew among the stones, filling every niche and crevice,
and little shelving space, with green and delicate tracery. She sank down
behind a great overhanging rock, which hid her from any one coming up the
path. An ash-tree was rooted in this rock, slanting away from the sea-breezes
that were prevalent in most weathers; but this was a still, autumnal Sabbath
evening. As Ruth's limbs fell, so they lay. She had no strength, no power
of volition to move a finger. She could not think or remember. She was
literally stunned. The first sharp sensation which roused her from her
torpor was a quick desire to see him once more; up she sprang, and climbed
to an out-jutting dizzy point of rock, but a little above her sheltered
nook, yet commanding a wide view over the bare, naked sands;--far away
below, touching the rippling water-line, was Stephen Bromley, busily gathering
in his nets; besides him there was no living creature visible. Ruth shaded
her eyes, as if she thought they might have deceived her; but no, there
was no one there. She went slowly down to her old place, crying sadly as
she went.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh! if I had not spoken so angrily to him--the last things I said were
so bitter--so reproachful!--and I shall never, never see him again!"</DD>

<DD>
She could not take in a general view and scope of their conversation--the
event was too near her for that; but her heart felt sore at the echo of
her last words, just and true as their severity was. Her struggle, her
constant flowing tears, which fell from very weakness, made her experience
a sensation of intense bodily fatigue; and her soul had lost the power
of throwing itself forward, or contemplating anything beyond the dreary
present, when the expanse of grey, wild, bleak moors, stretching wide away
below a sunless sky, seemed only an outward sign of the waste world within
her heart, for which she could claim no sympathy;-for she could not even
define what its woes were; and, if she could, no one would understand how
the present time was haunted by the terrible ghost of the former love.</DD>

<DD>
"I am so weary! I am so weary!" she moaned aloud at last. "I wonder if
I might stop here, and just die away."</DD>

<DD>
She shut her eyes, until through the closed lids came a ruddy blaze of
light. The clouds bad parted away, and the sun was going down in the crimson
glory behind the distant purple hills. The whole western sky was one flame
of fire. Ruth forgot herself in looking at the gorgeous sight. She sat
up gazing; and, as she gazed, the tears dried on her cheeks, and, somehow,
all human care and sorrow were swallowed up in the unconscious sense of
God's infinity. The sunset calmed her more than any words, however wise
and tender, could have done. It even seemed to give her strength and courage;
she did not know how or why, but so it was.</DD>

<DD>
She rose, and went slowly towards home. Her limbs were very stiff, and
every now and then she had to choke down an unbidden sob. Her pupils had
been long returned from church, and had busied themselves in preparing
tea--an occupation which had probably made them feel the time less long.</DD>

<DD>
If they had ever seen a sleep-walker, they might have likened Ruth to one
for the next few days, so slow and measured did her movements seem--so
far away was her intelligence from all that was passing around her--so
hushed and strange were the tones of her voice. They had letters from home,
announcing the triumphant return of Mr. Donne as M.P. for Eccleston. Mrs.
Denbigh heard the news without a word, and was too languid to join in the
search after purple and yellow flowers with which to deck the sitting-room
at Eagle's Crag.</DD>

<DD>
A letter from Jemima came the next day, summoning them home. Mr. Donne
and his friends had left the place, and quiet was restored in the Bradshaw
household; so it was time that Mary and Elizabeth's holiday should cease.
Mrs. Denbigh had also a letter--a letter from Miss Benson, saying that
Leonard was not quite well. There was so much pains taken to disguise anxiety,
that it was very evident much anxiety was felt; and the girls were almost
alarmed by Ruth's sudden change from taciturn languor to eager, vehement
energy. Body and mind seemed strained to exertion. Every plan that could
facilitate packing and winding up affairs at Abermouth, every errand and
arrangement that could expedite their departure by one minute, was done
by Ruth with stern promptitude. She spared herself in nothing. She made
them rest, made them lie down, while she herself lifted weights and transacted
business with feverish power, never resting, and trying never to have time
to think.</DD>

<DD>
For in remembrance of the Past there was Remorse--how had she forgotten
Leonard these last few days!--how had she repined and been dull of heart
to her blessing! And in anticipation of the future there was one sharp
point of red light in the darkness which pierced her brain with agony,
and which she would not see or recognise--and saw and recognised all the
more for such mad determination--which is not the true shield against the
bitterness of the arrows of death.</DD>

<DD>
When the seaside party arrived in Eccleston, they were met by Mrs. and
Miss Bradshaw and Mr. Benson. By a firm resolution, Ruth kept from shaping
the question, "Is he alive?" as if by giving shape to her fears she made
their realisation more imminent. She said merely, "How is he?" but she
said it with drawn, tight, bloodless lips, and in her eyes Mr. Benson read
her anguish of anxiety.</DD>

<DD>
"He is very ill, but we hope he will soon be better. It is what every child
has to go through."</DD>
