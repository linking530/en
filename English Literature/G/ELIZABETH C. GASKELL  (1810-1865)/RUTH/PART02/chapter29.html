The conversation narrated in the last chapter as taking place between Mr.
Farquhar and Jemima, occurred about a year after Ruth's dismissal from
her situation. That year, full of small events, and change of place to
the Bradshaws, had been monotonous and long in its course to the other
household. There had been no want of peace and tranquillity; there had,
perhaps, been more of them than in the preceding years, when, though unacknowledged
by any, all must have occasionally felt the oppression of the falsehood--and
a slight glancing dread must have flashed across their most prosperous
state, lest, somehow or another, the mystery should be disclosed. But now,
as the shepherd-boy in John Bunyan sweetly sang, "He that is low need fear
no fall."</DD>

<DD>
Still, their peace was as the stillness of a grey autumnal day, when no
sun is to be seen above, and when a quiet film seems drawn before both
sky and earth, as if to rest the wearied eyes after the summer's glare.
Few events broke the monotony of their lives, and those events were of
a depressing kind. They consisted in Ruth's futile endeavours to obtain
some employment, however humble; in Leonard's fluctuations of spirits and
health; in Sally's increasing deafness; in the final and unmendable wearing-out
of the parlour carpet, which there was no spare money to replace, and so
they cheerfully supplied its want by a large hearth-rug that Ruth made
out of ends of list; and, what was more a subject of unceasing regret to
Mr. Benson than all, the defection of some of the members of his congregation,
who followed Mr. Bradshaw's lead. Their places, to be sure, were more than
filled up by the poor, who thronged to his chapel; but still it was a disappointment
to find that people about whom he had been earnestly thinking--to whom
he had laboured to do good--should dissolve the connection without a word
of farewell or explanation. Mr. Benson did not wonder that they should
go; nay, he even felt it right that they should seek that spiritual help
from another, which he, by his error, had forfeited his power to offer;
he only wished they had spoken of their intention to him in an open and
manly way. But not the less did he labour on among those to whom God permitted
him to be of use. He felt age stealing upon him apace, although he said
nothing about it, and no one seemed to be aware of it; and he worked the
more diligently while "it was yet day." It was not the number of his years
that made him feel old, for he was only sixty, and many men are hale and
strong at that time of life; in all probability, it was that early injury
to his spine which affected the constitution of his mind as well as his
body, and predisposed him, in the opinion of some at least, to a feminine
morbidness of conscience. He had shaken off somewhat of this since the
affair with Mr. Bradshaw; he was simpler and more dignified than he had
been for several years before, during which time he had been anxious and
uncertain in his manner, and more given to thought than to action.</DD>

<DD>
The one happy bright spot in this grey year was owing to Sally. As she
said of herself, she believed she grew more "nattered" as she grew older;
but that she was conscious of her "natteredness" was a new thing, and a
great gain to the comfort of the house, for it made her very grateful for
forbearance, and more aware of kindness than she had ever been before.
She had become very deaf; yet she was uneasy and jealous if she were not
informed of all the family thoughts, plans, and proceedings, which often
had (however private in their details) to be shouted to her at the full
pitch of the voice. But she always heard Leonard perfectly. His clear and
bell-like voice, which was similar to his mother's till sorrow had taken
the ring out of it, was sure to be heard by the old servant, though every
one else had failed. Sometimes, however, she "got her hearing sudden,"
as she phrased it, and was alive to every word and noise, more particularly
when they did not want her to hear; and at such times she resented their
continuance of the habit of speaking loud as a mortal offence. One day,
her indignation at being thought deaf called out one of the rare smiles
on Leonard's face; she saw it, and said, "Bless thee, lad; if it but amuses
thee, they may shout through a ram's horn to me, and I'll never let on
I'm not deaf. It's as good a use as I can be of," she continued to herself,
"if I can make that poor lad smile a bit."</DD>

<DD>
If she expected to be everybody's confidant, she made Leonard hers. "There!"
said she, when she came home from her marketing one Saturday night, "look
here, lad! Here's forty-two pound, seven shillings and twopence! It's a
mint of money, isn't it? I took it all in sovereigns for fear of fire."</DD>

<DD>
"What is it all for, Sally?" said he.</DD>

<DD>
"Ay, lad! that's asking. It's Mr. Benson's money," said she mysteriously,
"that I've been keeping for him. Is he in the study, think ye?"</DD>

<DD>
"Yes! I think so. Where have you been keeping it?"</DD>

<DD>
"Never you mind!" She went towards the study, but, thinking she might have
been hard on her darling in refusing to gratify his curiosity, she turned
back and said--</DD>

<DD>
"I say--if thou wilt thou mayest do me a job of work some day. I'm wanting
a frame made for a piece of writing."</DD>

<DD>
And then she returned to go into the study, carrying her sovereigns in
her apron.</DD>

<DD>
"Here, Master Thurstan," said she, pouring them out on the table before
her astonished master. "Take it, it's all yours."</DD>

<DD>
"All mine! What can you mean?" asked he, bewildered.</DD>

<DD>
She did not hear him and went on--</DD>

<DD>
"Lock it up safe out o' the way. Dunnot go and leave it about to tempt
folks. I'll not answer for myself if money's left about. I may be cribbing
a sovereign."</DD>

<DD>
"But where does it come from?" said he.</DD>

<DD>
"Come from!" she replied. "Where does all money come from but the bank,
to be sure. I thought any one could tell that."</DD>

<DD>
"I have no money in the bank!" said he, more and more perplexed.</DD>

<DD>
"No, I knowed that; but I had. Dunnot ye remember how ye would raise my
wage last Martinmas eighteen year? You and Faith were very headstrong,
but I was too deep for you. See thee! I went and put it i' th' bank. I
was never going to touch it; and if I had died it would have been all right,
for I'd a will made, all regular and tight--made by a lawyer (leastwise
he would have been a lawyer if he hadn't got transported first). And now,
thinks I, I think I'll just go and get it out and give it 'em. Banks is
not always safe."</DD>

<DD>
"I'll take care of it for you with the greatest pleasure. Still, you know,
banks allow interest."</DD>

<DD>
"D'ye suppose I don't know all about interest and compound interest too
by this time? I tell ye I want ye to spend it. It's your own. It's not
mine. It always was yours. Now you're not going to fret me by saying you
think it mine."</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Benson held out his hand to her, for he could not speak. She bent forward
to him as he sat there and kissed him.</DD>

<DD>
"Eh, bless ye, lad! It's the first kiss I've had of ye sin' ye were a little
lad, and it's a great refreshment. Now don't you and Faith go and bother
me with talking about it. It's just yours, and make no more ado."</DD>

<DD>
She went back into the kitchen, and brought out her will, and gave Leonard
directions how to make a frame for it; for the boy was a very tolerable
joiner, and had a box of tools which Mr. Bradshaw had given him some years
ago.</DD>

<DD>
"It's a pity to lose such fine writing," said she; "though I can't say
as I can read it. Perhaps you'd just read it for me, Leonard." She sat
open-mouthed with admiration at all the long words.</DD>

<DD>
The frame was made, and the will hung up opposite to her bed, unknown to
any one but Leonard; and, by dint of his repeated reading it over to her,
she learnt all the words, except "testatrix" which she would always call
"testy tricks." Mr. Benson had been too much gratified and touched, by
her unconditional gift of all she had in the world, to reject it; but he
only held it in his hands as a deposit until he could find a safe investment
befitting so small a sum. The little rearrangements of the household expenditure
had not touched him as they had done the women. He was aware that meat-dinners
were not now everyday occurrences; but he preferred puddings and vegetables,
and was glad of the exchange. He observed, too, that they all sat together
in the kitchen in the evenings; but the kitchen, with the well-scoured
dresser, the shining saucepans, the well-blacked grate, and whitened hearth,
and the warmth which seemed to rise up from the very flags, and ruddily
cheer the most distant corners, appeared a very cosy and charming sitting-room;
and, besides, it appeared but right that Sally, in her old age, should
have the companionship of those with whom she had lived in love and faithfulness
so many years. He only wished he could more frequently leave the solitary
comfort of his study, and join the kitchen party; where Sally sat as mistress
in the chimney corner, knitting by firelight, and Miss Benson and Ruth,
with the candle between them, stitched away at their work; while Leonard
strewed the ample dresser with his slate and books. He did not mope and
pine over his lessons; they were the one thing that took him out of himself.
As yet his mother could teach him, though in some respects it was becoming
a strain upon her acquirements and powers. Mr. Benson saw this, but reserved
his offers of help as long as he could, hoping that before his assistance
became absolutely necessary, some mode of employment beyond that of occasional
plain-work might be laid open to Ruth.</DD>

<DD>
In spite of the communication they occasionally had with Mr. Farquhar,
when he gave them the intelligence of his engagement to Jemima, it seemed
like a glimpse into a world from which they were shut out. They wondered--Miss
Benson and Ruth did at least--much about the details. Ruth sat over her
sewing, fancying how all had taken place; and, as soon as she had arranged
the events which were going on among people and places once so familiar
to her, she found some discrepancy, and set-to afresh to picture the declaration
of love, and the yielding, blushing acceptance; for Mr. Farquhar had told
little beyond the mere fact that there was an engagement between himself
and Jemima which had existed for some time, but which had been kept secret
until now, when it was acknowledged, sanctioned, and to be fulfilled as
soon as he returned from an arrangement of family affairs in Scotland.
This intelligence had been enough for Mr. Benson, who was the only person
Mr. Farquhar saw; as Ruth always shrank from the post of opening the door,
and Mr. Benson was apt at recognising individual knocks, and always prompt
to welcome Mr. Farquhar.</DD>

<DD>
Miss Benson occasionally thought--and what she thought she was in the habit
of saying--that Jemima might have come herself to announce such an event
to old friends; but Mr. Benson decidedly vindicated her from any charge
of neglect, by expressing his strong conviction that to her they owed Mr.
Farquhar's calls--his all but out-spoken offers of service--his quiet,
steady interest in Leonard; and, moreover (repeating the conversation he
had had with her in the street, the first time they met after the disclosure),
Mr. Benson told his sister how glad he was to find that, with all the warmth
of her impetuous disposition hurrying her on to rebellion against her father,
she was now attaining to that just self-control which can distinguish between
mere wishes and true reasons--that she could abstain from coming to see
Ruth while she would do but little good, reserving herself for some great
occasion or strong emergency.</DD>

<DD>
Ruth said nothing, but she yearned all the more in silence to see Jemima.
In her recollection of that fearful interview with Mr. Bradshaw, which
haunted her yet, sleeping or waking, she was painfully conscious that she
had not thanked Jemima for her generous, loving advocacy; it had passed
unregarded at the time in intensity of agony--but now she recollected that
by no word, or tone, or touch, had she given any sign of gratitude. Mr.
Benson had never told her of his meeting with Jemima; so it seemed as if
there were no hope of any future opportunity for it is strange how two
households, rent apart by some dissension, can go through life, their parallel
existences running side by side, yet never touching each other, near neighbours
as they are, habitual and familiar guests as they may have been.</DD>

<DD>
Ruth's only point of hope was Leonard. She was weary of looking for work
and employment, which everywhere seemed held above her reach. She was not
impatient of this but she was very, very sorry. She felt within her such
capability, and all ignored her, and passed her by on the other side. But
she saw some progress in Leonard. Not that he could continue to have the
happy development, and genial ripening, which other boys have; leaping
from childhood to boyhood, and thence to youth, with glad bounds, and unconsciously
enjoying every age. At present there was no harmony in Leonard's character;
he was as full of thought and self-consciousness as many men, planning
his actions long beforehand, so as to avoid what he dreaded, and what she
could not yet give him strength to face, coward as she was herself, and
shrinking from hard remarks. Yet Leonard was regaining some of his lost
tenderness towards his mother; when they were alone he would throw himself
on her neck and smother her with kisses, without any apparent cause for
such a passionate impulse. If any one was by, his manner was cold and reserved.
The hopeful parts of his character were the determination evident in him
to be a "law unto himself," and the serious thought which he gave to the
formation of this law. There was an inclination in him to reason, especially
and principally with Mr. Benson, on the great questions of ethics which
the majority of the world have settled long ago. But I do not think he
ever so argued with his mother. Her lovely patience, and her humility,
was earning its reward; and from her quiet piety, bearing sweetly the denial
of her wishes--the refusal of her begging--the disgrace in which she lay,
while others, less worthy were employed--this, which perplexed him, and
almost angered him at first, called out his reverence at last, and what
she said he took for his law with proud humility; and thus softly she was
leading him up to God. His health was not strong; it was not likely to
be. He moaned and talked in his sleep, and his appetite was still variable,
part of which might be owing to his preference of the hardest lessons to
any outdoor exercise. But this last unnatural symptom was vanishing before
the assiduous kindness of Mr. Farquhar, and the quiet but firm desire of
his mother. Next to Ruth, Sally had perhaps the most influence over him;
but he dearly loved both Mr. and Miss Benson; although he was reserved
on this, as on every point not purely intellectual. His was a hard childhood,
and his mother felt that it was so. Children bear any moderate degree of
poverty and privation cheerfully; but, in addition to a good deal of this,
Leonard had to bear a sense of disgrace attaching to him and to the creature
he loved best; this it was that took out of him the buoyancy and natural
gladness of youth, in a way which no scantiness of food or clothing or
want of any outward comfort, could ever have done.</DD>

<DD>
Two years had passed away--two long, eventless years. Something was now
going to happen, which touched their hearts very nearly, though out of
their sight and hearing. Jemima was going to be married this August, and
by-and-by the very day was fixed. It was to be on the 14th. On the evening
of the 13th, Ruth was sitting alone in the parlour, idly gazing out on
the darkening shadows in the little garden; her eyes kept filling with
quiet tears, that rose, not for her own isolation from all that was going
on of bustle and preparation for the morrow's event, but because she had
seen how Miss Benson had felt that she and her brother were left out from
the gathering of old friends in the Bradshaw family. As Ruth sat, suddenly
she was aware of a figure by her; she started up, and in the gloom of the
apartment she recognised Jemima. In an instant they were in each other's
arms--a long, fast embrace.</DD>

<DD>
"Can you forgive me?" whispered Jemima in Ruth's ear.</DD>

<DD>
"Forgive you! What do you mean? What have I to forgive? The question is,
can I ever thank you as I long to do, if I could find words?"</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, Ruth, how I hated you once!"</DD>

<DD>
"It was all the more noble in you to stand by me as you did. You must have
hated me when you knew how I was deceiving you all!"</DD>

<DD>
"No, that was not it that made me hate you. It was before that. Oh, Ruth,
I did hate you!"</DD>

<DD>
They were silent for some time, still holding each other's hands. Ruth
spoke first--</DD>

<DD>
"And you are going to be married to-morrow!"</DD>

<DD>
"Yes," said Jemima. "To-morrow at nine o'clock. But I don't think I could
have been married without coming to wish Mr. Benson and Miss Faith good-bye."</DD>

<DD>
"I will go for them," said Ruth.</DD>

<DD>
"No, not just yet. I want to ask you one or two questions first. Nothing
very particular; only it seems as if there had been such a strange, long
separation between us. Ruth," said she, dropping her voice, "is Leonard
stronger than he was? I was so sorry to hear about him from Walter. But
he is better?" asked she anxiously.</DD>

<DD>
"Yes, he is better. Not what a boy of his age should be," replied his mother,
in a tone of quiet but deep mournfulness. "Oh, Jemima!" continued she,
"my sharpest punishment comes through him. To think of what he might have
been, and what he is."</DD>

<DD>
"But Walter says he is both stronger in health, and not so--nervous and
shy;" Jemima added the last words in a hesitating and doubtful manner,
as if she did not know how to express her full meaning without hurting
Ruth.</DD>

<DD>
"He does not show that he feels his disgrace so much. I cannot talk about
it, Jemima, my heart aches so about him. But he is better," she continued,
feeling that Jemima's kind anxiety required an answer at any cost of pain
to herself. "He is only studying too closely now; he takes to his lessons
evidently as a relief from thought. He is very clever, and I hope and trust,
yet I tremble to say it, I believe he is very good."</DD>

<DD>
"You must let him come and see us very often when we come back. We shall
be two months away. We are going to Germany, partly on Walter's business.
Ruth, I have been talking to papa to-night, very seriously and quietly;
and it has made me love him so much more, and understand him so much better."</DD>

<DD>
"Does he know of your coming here? I hope he does," said Ruth.</DD>

<DD>
"Yes. Not that he liked my doing it at all. But, somehow, I can always
do things against a person's wishes more easily when I am on good terms
with them--that's not exactly what I meant; but now to-night, after papa
had had been showing me that he really loved me more than I ever thought
he had done (for I always fancied he was so absorbed in Dick, he did not
care much for us girls), I felt brave enough to say that I intended to
come here and bid you all good-bye. He was silent for a minute, and then
said I might do it, but I must remember he did not approve of it, and was
not to be compromised by my coming; still I can tell that, at the bottom
of his heart, there is some of the old kindly feeling to Mr. and Miss Benson,
and I don't despair of its all being made up, though, perhaps, I ought
to say that mamma does."</DD>

<DD>
"Mr. and Miss Benson won't hear of my going away," said Ruth sadly.</DD>

<DD>
"They are quite right."</DD>

<DD>
"But I am earning nothing. I cannot get any employment. I am only a burden
and an expense."</DD>

<DD>
"Are you not also a pleasure? And Leonard, is he not a dear object of love?
It is easy for me to talk, I know, who am so impatient. Oh, I never deserved
to be so happy as I am! You don't know how good Walter is. I used to think
him so cold and cautious. But now, Ruth, will you tell Mr. and Miss Benson
that I am here? There is signing of papers, and I don't know what to be
done at home. And when I come back, I hope to see you often, if you'll
let me."</DD>

<DD>
Mr. and Miss Benson gave her a warm greeting. Sally was called in, and
would bring a candle with her, to have a close inspection of her, in order
to see if she was changed--she had not seen her for so long a time, she
said; and Jemima stood laughing and blushing in the middle of the room,
while Sally studied her all over, and would not be convinced that the old
gown which she was wearing for the last time was not one of the new wedding
ones. The consequence of which misunderstanding was, that Sally, in her
short petticoats and bedgown, turned up her nose at the old-fashioned way
in which Miss Bradshaw's gown was made. But Jemima knew the old woman,
and rather enjoyed the contempt for her dress. At last she kissed them
all, and ran away to her impatient Mr. Farquhar, who was awaiting her.</DD>

<DD>
Not many weeks after this, the poor old woman whom I have named as having
become a friend of Ruth's during Leonard's illness three years ago, fell
down and broke her hip-bone. It was a serious, probably a fatal, injury,
for one so old; and as soon as Ruth heard of it she devoted all her leisure
time to old Ann Fleming. Leonard had now outstripped his mother's powers
of teaching, and Mr. Benson gave him his lessons; so Ruth was a great deal
at the cottage both night and day.</DD>

<DD>
There Jemima found her one November evening, the second after their return
from their prolonged stay on the Continent. She and Mr. Farquhar had been
to the Bensons, and had sat there some time; and now Jemima had come on
just to see Ruth for five minutes, before the evening was too dark for
her to return alone. She found Ruth sitting on a stool before the fire,
which was composed of a few sticks on the hearth. The blaze they gave was,
however, enough to enable her to read; and she was deep in study of the
Bible in which she had read aloud to the poor old woman, until the latter
had fallen asleep. Jemima beckoned her out, and they stood on the green
just before the open door, so that Ruth could see if Ann awoke.</DD>

<DD>
"I have not many minutes to stay, only I felt as if I must see you. And
we want Leonard to come to us to see all our German purchases, and hear
all our German adventures. May he come to-morrow?"</DD>

<DD>
"Yes; thank you. Oh! Jemima, I have heard something--I have got a plan
that makes me so happy! I have not told any one yet. But Mr. Wynne (the
parish doctor, you know) has asked me if I would go out as a sick nurse--he
thinks he could find me employment."</DD>

<DD>
"You, a sick nurse!" said Jemima, involuntarily glancing over the beautiful
lithe figure, and the lovely refinement of Ruth's face as the light of
the rising moon fell upon it. "My dear Ruth, I don't think you are fitted
for it!"</DD>

<DD>
"Don't you?" said Ruth, a little disappointed. "I think I am; at least,
that I should be very soon. I like being about sick and helpless people;
I always feel so sorry for them; and then I think I have the gift of a
very delicate touch, which is such a comfort in many cases. And I should
try to be very watchful and patient. Mr. Wynne proposed it himself."</DD>

<DD>
"It was not in that way I meant you were not fitted for it. I meant that
you were fitted for something better. Why, Ruth, you are better educated
than I am!"</DD>

<DD>
"But if nobody will allow me to teach?--for that is what I suppose you
mean. Besides, I feel as if all my education would be needed to make me
a good sick nurse."</DD>

<DD>
"Your knowledge of Latin, for instance," said Jemima, hitting, in her vexation
at the plan, on the first acquirement of Ruth she could think of.</DD>

<DD>
"Well!" said Ruth, "that won't come amiss; I can read the prescriptions."</DD>

<DD>
"Which the doctors would rather you did not do."</DD>

<DD>
"Still, you can't say that any knowledge of any kind will be in my way,
or will unfit me for my work."</DD>

<DD>
"Perhaps not. But all your taste and refinement will be in your way, and
will unfit you."</DD>

<DD>
"You have not thought about this so much as I have, or you would not say
so. Any fastidiousness I shall have to get rid of, and I shall be better
without; but any true refinement I am sure I shall find of use; for don't
you think that every power we have may be made to help us in any right
work, whatever that is? Would you not rather be nursed by a person who
spoke gently and moved quietly about, than by a loud bustling woman?"</DD>

<DD>
"Yes, to be sure; but a person unfit for anything else may move quietly,
and speak gently, and give medicine when the doctor orders it, and keep
awake at night; and those are the best qualities I ever heard of in a sick
nurse."</DD>

<DD>
Ruth was quite silent for some time. At last she said, "At any rate it
is work, and as such I am thankful for it. You cannot discourage me--and
perhaps you know too little of what my life has been--how set apart in
idleness I have been--to sympathise with me fully."</DD>

<DD>
"And I wanted you to come to see us--me in my new home. Walter and I had
planned that we would persuade you to come to us very often" (she had planned,
and Mr. Farquhar had consented); "and now you will have to be fastened
up in a sick-room."</DD>

<DD>
"I could not have come," said Ruth quickly. "Dear Jemima! it is like you
to have thought of it--but I could not come to your house. It is not a
thing to reason about. It is just feeling. But I do feel as if I could
not go. Dear Jemima! if you are ill or sorrowful, and want me, I will come----"</DD>

<DD>
"So you would and must to any one, if you take up that calling."</DD>

<DD>
"But I should come to you, love, in quite a different way; I should go
to you with my heart full of love--so full that I am afraid I should be
too anxious."</DD>

<DD>
"I almost wish I were ill, that I might make you come at once."</DD>

<DD>
"And I am almost ashamed to think how I should like you to be in some position
in which I could show you how well I remember that day--that terrible day
in the school-room. God bless you for it, Jemima!"</DD>
