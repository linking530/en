Mr. Wynne, the parish surgeon, was right. He could and did obtain employment
for Ruth as a sick nurse. Her home was with the Bensons; every spare moment
was given to Leonard and to them; but she was at the call of all the invalids
in the town. At first her work lay exclusively among the paupers. At first,
too, there was a recoil from many circumstances, which impressed upon her
the most fully the physical sufferings of those whom she tended. But she
tried to lose the sense of these--or rather to lessen them, and make them
take their appointed places--in thinking of the individuals themselves,
as separate from their decaying frames; and all along she had enough self-command
to control herself from expressing any sign of repugnance. She allowed
herself no nervous haste of movement or touch that should hurt the feelings
of the poorest, most friendless creature, who ever lay a victim to disease.
There was no rough getting over of all the disagreeable and painful work
of her employment. When it was a lessening of pain to have the touch careful
and delicate, and the ministration performed with gradual skill, Ruth thought
of her charge, and not of herself. As she had foretold, she found a use
for all her powers. The poor patients themselves were unconsciously gratified
and soothed by her harmony and refinement of manner, voice, and gesture.
If this harmony and refinement had been merely superficial, it would not
have had this balmy effect. That arose from its being the true expression
of a kind, modest, and humble spirit. By degrees her reputation as a nurse
spread upwards, and many sought her good offices who could well afford
to pay for them. Whatever remuneration was offered to her, she took it
simply and without comment; for she felt that it was not hers to refuse;
that it was, in fact, owing to the Bensons for her and her child's subsistence.
She went wherever her services were first called for. If the poor bricklayer,
who broke both his legs in a fall from the scaffolding, sent for her when
she was disengaged, she went and remained with him until he could spare
her, let who would be the next claimant. From the happy and prosperous
in all but health she would occasionally beg off; when some one less happy
and more friendless wished for her; and sometimes she would ask for a little
money from Mr. Benson to give to such in their time of need. But it was
astonishing how much she was able to d6 without money.</DD>

<DD>
Her ways were very quiet; she never spoke much. Any one who has been oppressed
with the weight of a vital secret for years, and much more any one the
character of whose life has been stamped by one event, and that producing
sorrow and shame, is naturally reserved. And yet Ruth's silence was not
like reserve; it was too gentle and tender for that. It had more the effect
of a hush of all loud or disturbing emotions, and out of the deep calm
the words that came forth had a beautiful power. She did not talk much
about religion; but those who noticed her knew that it was the unseen banner
which she was following. The low-breathed sentences which she spoke into
the ear of the sufferer and the dying carried them upwards to God.</DD>

<DD>
She gradually became known and respected among the roughest boys of the
rough populace of the town. They would make way for her when she passed
along the streets with more deference than they used to most; for all knew
something of the tender care with which she had attended this or that sick
person, and, besides, she was so often in connection with Death that something
of the superstitious awe with which the dead were regarded by those rough
boys in the midst of their strong life, surrounded her.</DD>

<DD>
She herself did not feel changed. She felt just as faulty--as far from
being what she wanted to be, as ever. She best knew how many of her good
actions were incomplete, and marred with evil. She did not feel much changed
from the earliest Ruth she could remember. Everything seemed to change
but herself. Mr. and Miss Benson grew old, and Sally grew deaf, and Leonard
was shooting up, and Jemima was a mother. She and the distant hills that
she saw from her chamber window, seemed the only things which were the
same as when she first came to Eccleston. As she sat looking out, and taking
her fill of solitude, which sometimes was her most thorough rest--as she
sat at the attic window looking abroad--she saw their next-door neighbour
carried out to sun himself in his garden. When she first came to Eccleston,
this neighbour and his daughter were often seen taking long and regular
walks; by-and-by his walks became shorter, and the attentive daughter would
convoy him home, and set out afresh to finish her own. Of late years he
had only gone out in the garden behind his house; but at first he had walked
pretty briskly there by his daughter's help--now he was carried, and placed
in a large, cushioned easy-chair, his head remaining where it was placed
against the pillow, and hardly moving when his kind daughter, who was now
middle-aged, brought him the first roses of the summer. This told Ruth
of the lapse of life and time.</DD>

<DD>
Mr. and Mrs. Farquhar were constant in their attentions; but there was
no sign of Mr. Bradshaw ever forgiving the imposition which had been practised
upon him, and Mr. Benson ceased to hope for any renewal of their intercourse.
Still, he thought that he must know of all the kind attentions which Jemima
paid to them, and of the fond regard which both she and her husband bestowed
on Leonard. This latter feeling even went so far that Mr. Farquhar called
one day, and with much diffidence begged Mr. Benson to urge Ruth to let
him be sent to school at his (Mr. Farquhar's) expense.</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Benson was taken by surprise, and hesitated. "I do not know. It would
be a great advantage in some respects; and yet I doubt whether it would
in others. His mother's influence over him is thoroughly good, and I should
fear that any thoughtless allusions to his peculiar position might touch
the raw spot in his mind."</DD>

<DD>
"But he is so unusually clever, it seems a shame not to give him all the
advantages he can have. Besides, does he see much of his mother now?"</DD>

<DD>
"Hardly a day passes without her coming home to be an hour or so with him,
even at her busiest times; she says it is her best refreshment. And often,
you know, she is disengaged for a week or two, except the occasional services
which she is always rendering to those who need her. Your offer is very
tempting, but there is so decidedly another view of the question to be
considered, that I believe we must refer it to her."</DD>

<DD>
"With all my heart. Don't hurry her to a decision. Let her weigh it well.
I think she will find the advantages preponderate."</DD>

<DD>
"I wonder if I might trouble you with a little business, Mr. Farquhar,
as you are here?"</DD>

<DD>
"Certainly; I am only too glad to be of any use to you."</DD>

<DD>
"Why, I see from the report of the Star Life Assurance Company in the <I>Times</I>,
which you are so good as to send me, that they have declared a bonus on
the shares; now it seems strange that I have received no notification of
it, and I thought that perhaps it might be lying at your office, as Mr.
Bradshaw was the purchaser of the shares, and I have always received the
dividends through your firm."</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Farquhar took the newspaper, and ran his eye over the report.</DD>

<DD>
"I have no doubt that's the way of it," said he. "Some of our clerks have
been careless about it; or it may be Richard himself. He is not always
the most punctual and exact of mortals; but I'll see about it. Perhaps
after all it mayn't come for a day or two; they have always such numbers
of these circulars to send out."</DD>

<DD>
"Oh! I'm in no hurry about it. I only want to receive it some time before
I incur any expenses, which the promise of this bonus may tempt me to indulge
in."</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Farquhar took his leave. That evening there was a long conference,
for, as it happened, Ruth was at home. She was strenuously against the
school plan. She could see no advantages that would counterbalance the
evil which she dreaded from any school for Leonard; namely, that the good
opinion and regard of the world would assume too high an importance in
his eyes. The very idea seemed to produce in her so much shrinking affright,
that by mutual consent the subject was dropped; to be taken up again, or
not, according to circumstances.</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Farquhar wrote the next morning, on Mr. Benson's behalf, to the Insurance
Company, to inquire about the bonus. Although he wrote in the usual formal
way, he did not think it necessary to tell Mr. Bradshaw what he had done;
for Mr. Benson's name was rarely mentioned between the partners; each had
been made fully aware of the views which the other entertained on the subject
that had caused the estrangement; and Mr. Farquhar felt that no external
argument could affect Mr. Bradshaw's resolved disapproval and avoidance
of his former minister.</DD>

<DD>
As it happened, the answer from the Insurance Company (directed to the
firm) was given to Mr. Bradshaw along with the other business letters.
It was to the effect that Mr. Benson's shares had been sold and transferred
above a twelvemonth ago, which sufficiently accounted for the circumstance
that no notification of the bonus had been sent to him.</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Bradshaw tossed the letter on one side, not displeased to have a good
reason for feeling a little contempt at the unbusiness-like forgetfulness
of Mr. Benson, at. whose instance some one had evidently been writing to
the Insurance Company. On Mr. Farquhar's entrance, he expressed this feeling
to him.</DD>

<DD>
"Really," he said, "these Dissenting ministers have no more notion of exactitude
in their affairs than a child! The idea of forgetting that he has sold
his shares, and applying for the bonus, when it seems he has transferred
them only a year ago!"</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Farquhar was reading the letter while Mr. Bradshaw spoke.</DD>

<DD>
"I don't quite understand it," said he. "Mr. Benson was quite clear about
it. He could not have received his half-yearly dividends unless he had
been possessed of these shares; and I don't suppose Dissenting ministers,
with all their ignorance of business, are unlike other men in knowing whether
or not they receive the money that they believe to be owing to them."</DD>

<DD>
"I should not wonder if they were--if Benson was, at any rate. Why, I never
knew his watch to be right in all my life--it was always too fast or too
slow; it must have been a daily discomfort to him. It ought to have been.
Depend upon it, his money matters are just in the same irregular state;
no accounts kept, I'll be bound."</DD>

<DD>
"I don't see that that follows," said Mr. Farquhar, half amused. "That
watch of his is a very curious one--belonged to his father and grandfather,
I don't know how far back."</DD>

<DD>
"And the sentimental feelings which he is guided by prompt him to keep
it, to the inconvenience of himself and every one else."</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Farquhar gave up the subject of the watch as hopeless.</DD>

<DD>
"But about this letter. I wrote, at Mr. Benson's desire, to the Insurance
Office, and I am not satisfied with this answer. All the transaction has
passed through our hands. I do not think it is likely Mr. Benson would
write and sell the shares without, at any rate, informing us at the time,
even though he forgot all about it afterwards."</DD>

<DD>
"Probably he told Richard, or Mr. Watson."</DD>

<DD>
"We can ask Mr. Watson at once. I am afraid we must wait till Richard comes
home, for I don't know where a letter would catch him."</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Bradshaw pulled the bell that rang into the head-clerk's room, saying
as he did so--</DD>

<DD>
"You may depend upon it, Farquhar, the blunder lies with Benson himself.
He is just the man to muddle away his money in indiscriminate charity,
and then to wonder what has become of it."</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Farquhar was discreet enough to hold his tongue.</DD>

<DD>
"Mr. Watson," said Mr. Bradshaw, as the old clerk made his appearance,
"here is some mistake about those Insurance shares we purchased for Benson
ten or a dozen years ago. He spoke to Mr. Farquhar about some bonus they
are paying to the shareholders, it seems; and, in reply to Mr. Farquhar's
letter, the Insurance Company say the shares were sold twelve months since.
Have you any knowledge of the transaction? Has the transfer passed through
your hands? By the way" (turning to Mr. Farquhar), "who kept the certificates?
Did Benson or we?"</DD>

<DD>
"I really don't know," said Mr. Farquhar. Perhaps Mr. Watson can tell us."</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Watson meanwhile was studying the letter. When he had ended it, he
took off his spectacles, wiped them, and replacing them, he read it again.</DD>

<DD>
"It seems very strange, sir," he said at length, with his trembling, aged
voice, "for I paid Mr. Benson the account of the dividends myself last
June, and got a receipt in form, and that is since the date of the alleged
transfer."</DD>

<DD>
"Pretty nearly twelve months after it took place," said Mr. Farquhar.</DD>

<DD>
"How did you receive the dividends? An order on the Bank, along with old
Mrs. Cranmer's?" asked Mr. Bradshaw sharply.</DD>

<DD>
"I don't know how they came. Mr. Richard gave me the money, and desired
me to get the receipt."</DD>

<DD>
"It's unlucky Richard is from home," said Mr. Bradshaw; "he could have
cleared up this mystery for us."</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Farquhar was silent.</DD>

<DD>
"Do you know where the certificates were kept, Mr. Watson?" said he.</DD>

<DD>
"I'll not be sure, but I think they were with Mrs. Cranmer's papers and
deeds in box A, 24."</DD>

<DD>
"I wish old Cranmer would have made any other man his executor. She, too,
is always coming with some unreasonable request or other."</DD>

<DD>
"Mr. Benson's inquiry about his bonus is perfectly reasonable, at any rate."</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Watson, who was dwelling in the slow fashion of age on what had been
said before, now spoke--</DD>

<DD>
"I'll not be sure, but I am almost certain, Mr. Benson said, when I paid
him last June, that he thought he ought to give the receipt on a stamp,
and had spoken about it to Mr. Richard the time before, but that Mr. Richard
said it was of no consequence. Yes," continued he, gathering up his memory
as he went on, "he did--I remember now--and I thought to myself that Mr.
Richard was but a young man. Mr. Richard will know all about it."</DD>

<DD>
"Yes," said Mr. Farquhar gravely.</DD>

<DD>
"I shan't wait till Richard's return," said Mr. Bradshaw. "We can soon
see if the certificates are in the box Watson points out; if they are there,
the Insurance people are no more fit to manage their concern than that
cat, and I shall tell them so. If they are not there (as I suspect will
prove to be the case), it is just forgetfulness on Benson's part, as I
have said from the first."</DD>

<DD>
"You forget the payment of the dividends," said Mr. Farquhar, in a low
voice.</DD>

<DD>
"Well, sir! what then?" said Mr. Bradshaw abruptly. While he spoke--while
his eye met Mr. Farquhar's--the hinted meaning of the latter flashed through
his mind; but he was only made angry to find that such a suspicion could
pass through any one's imagination.</DD>

<DD>
"I suppose I may go, sir," said Watson respectfully, an uneasy consciousness
of what was in Mr. Farquhar's thoughts troubling the faithful old clerk.</DD>

<DD>
"Yes. Go. What do you mean about the dividends?" asked Mr. Bradshaw impetuously
of Mr. Farquhar.</DD>

<DD>
"Simply, that I think there can have been no forgetfulness--no mistake
on Mr. Benson's part," said Mr. Farquhar, unwilling to put his dim suspicion
into words.</DD>

<DD>
"Then, of course, it is some blunder of that confounded Insurance Company.
I will write to them to-day, and make them a little brisker and more correct
in their statements."</DD>

<DD>
"Don't you think it would be better to wait till Richard's return? He may
be able to explain it."</DD>

<DD>
"No, sir!" said Mr. Bradshaw sharply. "I do not think it would be better.
It has not been my way of doing business to spare any one, or any company,
the consequences of their own carelessness; nor to obtain information second-hand,
when I could have it direct from the source. I shall write to the Insurance
Office by the next post."</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Farquhar saw that any further remonstrance on his part would only aggravate
his partner's obstinacy: and, besides, it was but a suspicion,--an uncomfortable
suspicion. It was possible that some of the clerks at the Insurance Office
might have made a mistake. Watson was not sure, after all, that the certificates
had been deposited in box A, 24; and when he and Mr. Farquhar could not
find them there, the old man drew more and yet more back from his first
assertion of belief, that they had been placed there.</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Bradshaw wrote an angry and indignant reproach of carelessness to the
Insurance Company. By the next mail one of their clerks came down to Eccleston;
and, having leisurely refreshed himself at the inn, and ordered his dinner
with care, he walked up to the great warehouse of Bradshaw &amp; Co., and
sent in his card, with a pencil notification, "On the part of the Star
Insurance Company," to Mr. Bradshaw himself.</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Bradshaw held the card in his hand for a minute or two without raising
his eyes. Then he spoke out loud and firm--</DD>

<DD>
"Desire the gentleman to walk up. Stay! I will ring my bell in a minute
or two, and then show him upstairs."</DD>

<DD>
When the errand-boy had closed the door, Mr. Bradshaw went to a cupboard
where he usually kept a glass and a bottle of wine (of which he very seldom
partook, for he was an abstemious man). He intended now to take a glass,
but the bottle was empty; and, though there was plenty more to be had for
ringing, or even simply going into another room, he would not allow himself
to do this. He stood and lectured himself in thought.</DD>

<DD>
"After all, I am a fool for once in my life. If the certificates are in
no box which I have yet examined, that does not imply they may not be in
some one which I have not had time to search. Farquhar would stay so late
last night! And, even if they are in none of the boxes here, that does
not prove----" He gave the bell a jerking ring, and it was yet sounding
when Mr. Smith, the insurance clerk, entered.</DD>

<DD>
The manager of the Insurance Company had been considerably nettled at the
tone of Mr. Bradshaw's letter; and had instructed the clerk to assume some
dignity at first in vindicating (as it was well in his power to do) the
character of the proceedings of the Company, but at the same time he was
not to go too far, for the firm of Bradshaw &amp; Co. was daily looming
larger in the commercial world, and if any reasonable explanation could
be given it was to be received, and bygones be bygones.</DD>

<DD>
"Sit down, sir!" said Mr. Bradshaw.</DD>

<DD>
"You are aware, sir, I presume, that I come on the part of Mr. Dennison,
the manager of the Star Insurance Company, to reply in person to a letter
of yours, of the 29th, addressed to him?"</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Bradshaw bowed. "Avery careless piece of business," he said stiffly.</DD>

<DD>
"Mr. Dennison does not think you will consider it as such when you have
seen the deed of transfer, which I am commissioned to show you."</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Bradshaw took the deed with a steady hand. He wiped his spectacles
quietly, without delay, and without hurry, and adjusted them on his nose.
It is possible that he was rather long in looking over the document--at
least, the clerk had just begun to wonder if he was reading through the
whole of it, instead of merely looking at the signature, when Mr. Bradshaw
said: "It is possible that it may be----of course, you will allow me to
take this paper to Mr. Benson, to--to inquire if this be his signature?"</DD>

<DD>
"There can be no doubt of it, I think, sir," said the clerk, calmly smiling,
for he knew Mr. Benson's signature well.</DD>

<DD>
"I don't know, sir--I don't know." (He was speaking as if the pronunciation
of every word required a separate effort of will, like a man who has received
a slight paralytic stroke.)</DD>

<DD>
"You have heard, sir, of such a thing as forgery--forgery, sir?" said he,
repeating the last word very distinctly; for he feared that the first time
he had said it, it was rather slurred over.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, sir! there is no room for imagining such a thing, I assure you. In
our affairs we become aware of curious forgetfulness on the part of those
who are not of business habits."</DD>

<DD>
"Still I should like to show it Mr. Benson, to prove to him his forgetfulness,
you know. I believe, on my soul, it is some of his careless forgetfulness--I
do, sir," said he. Now he spoke very quickly. "It must have been. Allow
me to convince myself. You shall have it back to-night, or the first thing
in the morning."</DD>

<DD>
The clerk did not quite like to relinquish the deed, nor yet did he like
to refuse Mr. Bradshaw. If that very uncomfortable idea of forgery should
have any foundation in truth--and he had given up the writing! There were
a thousand chances to one against its being anything but a stupid blunder;
the risk was more imminent of offending one of the directors.</DD>

<DD>
As he hesitated, Mr. Bradshaw spoke very calmly, and almost with a smile
on his face. He had regained his self-command. "You are afraid, I see.
I assure you, you may trust me. If there has been any fraud--if I have
the slightest suspicion of the truth of the surmise I threw out just now,"--he
could not quite speak the bare naked word that was chilling his heart--"I
will not fail to aid the ends of justice, even though the culprit should
be my own son."</DD>

<DD>
He ended, as he began, with a smile--such a smile!--the stiff lips refused
to relax and cover the teeth. But all the time he kept saying to himself--</DD>

<DD>
"I don't believe it--I don't believe it. I'm convinced it's a blunder of
that old fool Benson."</DD>

<DD>
But when he had dismissed the clerk, and secured the piece of paper, he
went and locked the door, and laid his head on his desk, and moaned aloud.</DD>

<DD>
He had lingered in the office for the two previous nights; at first, occupying
himself in searching for the certificates of the Insurance shares; but,
when all the boxes and other repositories for papers had been ransacked,
the thought took hold of him that they might be in Richard's private desk;
and, with the determination which overlooks the means to get at the end,
he had first tried all his own keys on the complicated lock, and then broken
it open with two decided blows of a poker, the instrument nearest at hand.
He did not find the certificates. Richard had always considered himself
careful in destroying any dangerous or tell-tale papers; but the stern
father found enough, in what remained, to convince him that his pattern
son--more even than his pattern son, his beloved pride--was far other than
what he seemed.</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Bradshaw did not skip or miss a word. He did not shrink while he read.
He folded up letter by letter; he snuffed the candle when its light began
to wane, and no sooner; but he did not miss or omit one paper--he read
every word. Then, leaving the letters in a heap upon the table, and the
broken desk to tell its own tale, he locked the door of the room which
was appropriated to his son as junior partner, and carried the key away
with him.</DD>

<DD>
There was a faint hope, even after this discovery of many circumstances
of Richard's life, which shocked and dismayed his father--there was still
a faint hope that he might not be guilty of forgery--that it might not
be no forgery after all--only a blunder--an omission--a stupendous piece
of forgetfulness. That hope was the one straw that Mr. Bradshaw clung to.</DD>

<DD>
Late that night Mr. Benson sat in his study Every one else in the house
had gone to bed; but he was expecting a summons to some one who was dangerously
ill. He was not startled, therefore, at the knock which came to the front
door about twelve; but he was rather surprised at the character of the
knock, so slow and loud, with a pause between each rap. His study-door
was but a step from that which led into the street. He opened it, and there
stood--Mr. Bradshaw; his large, portly figure not to be mistaken even in
the dusky night.</DD>

<DD>
He said, "That is right. It was you I wanted to see." And he walked straight
into the study. Mr. Benson followed, and shut the door. Mr. Bradshaw was
standing by the table, fumbling in his pocket. He pulled out the deed;
and, opening it, after a pause, in which you might have counted five, he
held it out to Mr. Benson.</DD>

<DD>
"Read it! " said he. He spoke not another word until time had been allowed
for its perusal. Then he added--</DD>

<DD>
"That is your signature?" The words were an assertion, but the tone was
that of question.</DD>

<DD>
"No, it is not," said Mr. Benson decidedly. "It is very like my writing.
I could almost say it was mine, but I know it is not."</DD>

<DD>
"Recollect yourself a little. The date is August the third of last year,
fourteen months ago. You may have forgotten it." The tone of the voice
had a kind of eager entreaty in it, which Mr. Benson did not notice--he
was so startled at the fetch of his own writing.</DD>

<DD>
"It is most singularly like mine; but I could not have signed away these
shares--all the property I have--without the slightest remembrance of it."</DD>

<DD>
"Stranger things have happened. For the love of Heaven, think if you did
not sign it. It's a deed to transfer for those Insurance shares, you see.
You don't remember it? You did not write this name--these words?" He looked
at Mr. Benson with craving wistfulness for one particular answer. Mr. Benson
was struck at last by the whole proceeding, and glanced anxiously at Mr.
Bradshaw, whose manner, gait, and voice, were so different from usual that
he might well excite attention. But as soon as the latter was aware of
this momentary inspection, he changed his tone all at once.</DD>

<DD>
"Don't imagine, sir, I wish to force any invention upon you as a remembrance.
If you did not write this name, I know who did. Once more I ask you--does
no glimmering recollection of--having needed money, we'll say--I never
wanted you to refuse my subscription to the chapel, God knows!--of having
sold these accursed shares?--Oh! I see by your face you did not write it;
you need not to speak to me--I know."</DD>

<DD>
He sank down into a chair near him. His whole figure drooped. In a moment
he was up, and standing straight as an arrow, confronting Mr. Benson, who
could find n6 clue to this stern man's agitation.</DD>

<DD>
"You say you did not write these words?" pointing to the signature, with
an untrembling finger. "I believe you; Richard Bradshaw did write them."</DD>

<DD>
"My dear sir--my dear old friend!" exclaimed Mr. Benson, "you are rushing
to a conclusion for which, I am convinced, there is no foundation; there
is no reason to suppose that because----"</DD>

<DD>
"There is reason, sir. Do not distress yourself--I am perfectly calm."
His stony eyes and immovable face did indeed look rigid. "What we have
now to do is to punish the offence. I have not one standard for myself
and those I love--(and, Mr. Benson, I did love him)--and another for the
rest of the world. If a stranger had forged my name, I should have known
it was my duty to prosecute him. You must prosecute Richard."</DD>

<DD>
"I will not," said Mr. Benson.</DD>

<DD>
"You think, perhaps, that I shall feel it acutely. You are mistaken. He
is no longer as my son to me. I have always resolved to disown any child
of mine who was guilty of sin. I disown Richard. He is as a stranger to
me. I shall feel no more at his exposure--his punishment----" He could
not go on for his voice was choking. "Of course, you understand that I
must feel shame at our connection; it is that that is troubling me; that
is but consistent with a man who has always prided himself on the integrity
of his name; but as for that boy, who has been brought up all his life
as I have brought up my children, it must be some innate wickedness! Sir,
I can cut him off, though he has been as my right hand--beloved. Let me
be no hindrance to the course of justice, I beg. He has forged your name--he
has defrauded you of money--of your all, I think you said."</DD>

<DD>
"Some one has forged my name. I am not convinced that it was your son.
Until I know all the circumstances, I decline to prosecute."</DD>

<DD>
"What circumstances?" asked Mr. Bradshaw, in an authoritative manner, which
would have shown irritation but for his self-command.</DD>

<DD>
"The force of the temptation--the previous habits of the person----"</DD>

<DD>
"Of Richard. He is the person," Mr. Bradshaw put in.</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Benson went on, without taking any notice. "I should think it right
to prosecute, if I found out that this offence against me was only one
of a series committed, with premeditation, against society. I should then
feel, as a protector of others more helpless than myself----"</DD>

<DD>
"It was your all," said Mr. Bradshaw.</DD>

<DD>
"It was all my money; it was not my all," replied Mr. Benson; and then
he went on as if the interruption had never been--"Against an habitual
offender. I shall not prosecute Richard. Not because he is your son--do
not imagine that! I should decline taking such a step against any young
man without first ascertaining the particulars about him, which I know
already about Richard, and which determine me against doing what would
blast his character for life--would destroy every good quality he has."</DD>

<DD>
"What good quality remains to him?" asked Mr. Bradshaw. "He has deceived
me--he has offended God."</DD>

<DD>
"Have we not all offended Him?" Mr. Benson said in a low tone.</DD>

<DD>
"Not consciously. I never do wrong consciously. But Richard--Richard."
The remembrance of the undeceiving letters--the forgery--filled up his
heart so completely that he could not speak for a minute or two. Yet when
he saw Mr. Benson on the point of saying something, he broke in--</DD>

<DD>
"It is no use talking, sir. You and I cannot agree on these subjects. Once
more, I desire you to prosecute that boy, who is no longer a child of mine."</DD>

<DD>
"Mr. Bradshaw, I shall not prosecute him. I have said it once for all.
To-morrow you will be glad that I do not listen to you. I should only do
harm by saying more at present."</DD>

<DD>
There is always something aggravating in being told, that the mood in which
we are now viewing things strongly will not be our mood at some other time.
It implies that our present feelings are blinding us, and that some more
clear-sighted spectator is able to distinguish our future better than we
do ourselves. The most shallow person dislikes to be told that any one
can gauge his depth. Mr. Bradshaw was not soothed by this last remark of
Mr. Benson's. He stooped down to take up his hat and be gone. Mr. Benson
saw his dizzy way of groping, and gave him what he sought for; but he received
no word of thanks. Mr. Bradshaw went silently towards the door, but, just
as he got there, he turned round, and said--</DD>

<DD>
"If there were more people like me, and fewer like you, there would be
less evil in the world, sir. It's your sentimentalists that nurse up sin."</DD>

<DD>
Although Mr. Benson had been very calm during this interview, he had been
much shocked by what had been let out respecting Richard's forgery; not
by the fact itself so much as by what it was a sign of. Still, he had known
the young man from childhood, and had seen, and often regretted, that his
want of moral courage had rendered him peculiarly liable to all the bad
effects arising from his father's severe and arbitrary mode of treatment.
Dick would never have had "pluck" enough to be a hardened villain, under
any circumstances: but, unless some good influence some strength, was brought
to bear upon him, he might easily sink into the sneaking scoundrel. Mr.
Benson determined to go to Mr. Farquhar's the first thing in the morning,
and consult him as a calm, clear-headed family friend--partner in the business,
as well as son- and brother-in-law to the people concerned.</DD>
