If Jemima allowed herself now and then to imagine that one good would result
from the discovery of Richard's delinquency, in the return of her father
and Mr. Benson to something of their old understanding and their old intercourse--if
this hope fluttered through her mind, it was doomed to disappointment.
Mr. Benson would have been most happy to go, if Mr. Bradshaw had sent for
him he was on the watch for what might be even the shadow of such an invitation--but
none came. Mr. Bradshaw, on his part, would have been thoroughly glad if
the wilful seclusion of his present life could have been broken by the
occasional visits of the old friend whom he had once forbidden the house;
but, this prohibition having passed his lips, he stubbornly refused to
do anything which might be construed into unsaying it. Jemima was for some
time in despair of his ever returning to the office, or resuming his old
habits of business. He had evidently threatened as much to her husband.
All that Jemima could do was to turn a deaf ear to every allusion to this
menace, which he threw out from time to time, evidently with a view to
see if it had struck deep enough into her husband's mind for him to have
repeated it to his wife. If Mr. Farquhar had named it--if it was known
only to two or three to have been, but for one half-hour even, his resolution--Mr.
Bradshaw could have adhered to it, without any other reason than the maintenance
of what he called consistency, but which was in fact doggedness. Jemima
was often thankful that her mother was absent, and gone to nurse her son.
If she had been at home, she would have entreated and implored her husband
to fall back into his usual habits, and would have shown such a dread of
his being as good as his word, that he would have been compelled to adhere
to it by the very consequence affixed to it. Mr. Farquhar had hard work,
as it was, in passing rapidly enough between the two places--attending
to his business at Eccleston; and deciding, comforting, and earnestly talking,
in Richard's sick-room. During an absence of his, it was necessary to apply
to one of the partners on some matter of importance; and accordingly, to
Jemima's secret joy, Mr. Watson came up and asked if her father was well
enough to see him on business? Jemima carried in this inquiry literally;
and the hesitating answer which her father gave was in the affirmative.
It was not long before she saw him leave the house, accompanied by the
faithful old clerk; and when he met her at dinner he made no allusion to
his morning visitor, or to his subsequent going out. But from that time
forwards he went regularly to the office. He received all the information
about Dick's accident, and his progress towards recovery, in perfect silence,
and in as indifferent a manner as he could assume; but yet he lingered
about the family sitting-room every morning until the post had come in
which brought all letters from the south.</DD>

<DD>
When Mr. Farquhar at last returned to bring the news of Dick's perfect
convalescence, he resolved to tell Mr. Bradshaw all that he had done and
arranged for his son's future career; but, as Mr. Farquhar told Mr. Benson
afterwards, he could not really say if Mr. Bradshaw had attended to one
word that he said.</DD>

<DD>
"Rely upon it," said Mr. Benson, "he has not only attended to it, but treasured
up every expression you have used."</DD>

<DD>
"Well, I tried to get some opinion, or sign of emotion, out of him. I had
not much hope of the latter, I must own; but I thought he would have said
whether I had done wisely or not in procuring that Glasgow situation for
Dick--that he would, perhaps, have been indignant at my ousting him from
the partnership so entirely on my own responsibility."</DD>

<DD>
"How did Richard take it?"</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, nothing could exceed his penitence. If one had never heard of the
proverb, 'When the devil was sick, the devil a monk would be,' I should
have had greater faith in him; or if he had had more strength of character
to begin with, or more reality and less outward appearance of good principle
instilled into him. However, this Glasgow situation is the very thing;
clear, defined duties, no great trust reposed in him, a kind and watchful
head, and introductions to a better class of associates than I fancy he
has ever been thrown amongst before. For, you know, Mr. Bradshaw dreaded
all intimacies for his son, and wanted him to eschew all society beyond
his own family--would never allow him to ask a friend home. Really, when
I think of the unnatural life Mr. Bradshaw expected him to lead, I get
into charity with him, and have hopes. By the way, have you ever succeeded
in persuading his mother to send Leonard to school? He may run the same
risk from isolation as Dick: not be able to choose his companions wisely
when he grows up, but be too much overcome by the excitement of society
to be very discreet as to who are his associates. Have you spoken to her
about my plan?"</DD>

<DD>
"Yes! but to no purpose. I cannot say that she would even admit an argument
on the subject. She seemed to have an invincible repugnance to the idea
of exposing him to the remarks of other boys on his peculiar position."</DD>

<DD>
"They need never know of it. Besides, sooner or later, he must step out
of his narrow circle, and encounter remark and scorn."</DD>

<DD>
"True," said Mr. Benson mournfully. "And you may depend upon it, if it
really is the best for Leonard, she will come round to it by-and-by. It
is almost extraordinary to see the way in which her earnest and most unselfish
devotion to this boy's real welfare leads her to right and wise conclusions."</DD>

<DD>
"I wish I could tame her so as to let me meet her as a friend. Since the
baby was born, she comes to see Jemima. My wife tells me, that she sits
and holds it soft in her arms, and talks to it as if her whole soul went
out to the little infant. But if she hears a strange footstep on the stair,
what Jemima calls the 'wild-animal look' comes back into her eyes, and
she steals away like some frightened creature. With all that she has done
to redeem her character, she should not be so timid of observation.</DD>

<DD>
"You may well say 'with all that she has done!' We of her own household
hear little or nothing of what she does. If she wants help, she simply
tells us how and why; but if not--perhaps because it is some relief to
her to forget for a time the scenes of suffering in which she has been
acting the part of comforter, and perhaps because there always was a shy,
sweet reticence about her--we never should know what she is and what she
does, except from the poor people themselves, who would bless her in words
if the very thought of her did not choke them with tears. Yet, I do assure
you, she passes out of all this gloom, and makes sunlight in our house.
We are never so cheerful as when she is at home. She always had the art
of diffusing peace, but now it is positive cheerfulness. And about Leonard;
I doubt if the wisest and most thoughtful schoolmaster could teach half
as much directly, as his mother does unconsciously and indirectly every
hour that he is with her. Her noble, humble, pious endurance of the consequences
of what was wrong in her early life seems expressly fitted to act upon
him, whose position is (unjustly, for he has done no harm) so similar to
hers."</DD>

<DD>
"Well! I suppose we must leave it alone for the present. You will think
me a hard practical man when I own to you, that all I expect from Leonard's
remaining a home-bird is that, with such a mother, it will do him no harm.
At any rate, remember my offer is the same for a year--two years hence,
as now. What does she look forward to making him into, finally?"</DD>

<DD>
"I don't know. The wonder comes into my mind sometimes; but never into
hers, I think. It is part of her character--part perhaps of that which
made her what she was--that she never looks forward, and seldom back. The
present is enough for her."</DD>

<DD>
And so the conversation ended. When Mr. Benson repeated the substance of
it to his sister, she mused awhile, breaking out into an occasional whistle
(although she had cured herself of this habit in a great measure), and
at last she said--</DD>

<DD>
"Now, do you know, I never liked poor Dick; and yet I'm angry with Mr.
Farquhar for getting him out of the partnership in such a summary way.
I can't get over it, even though he has offered to send Leonard to school.
And here he's reigning lord-paramount at the office! As if you, Thurstan,
weren't as well able to teach him as any schoolmaster in England! But I
should not mind that affront, if I were not sorry to think of Dick (though
I never could abide him) labouring away in Glasgow for a petty salary of
nobody knows how little, while Mr. Farquhar is taking halves, instead of
thirds, of the profits here!"</DD>

<DD>
But her brother could not tell her--and even Jemima did not know till long
afterwards--that the portion of income which would have been Dick's as
a junior partner, if he had remained in the business, was carefully laid
aside for him by Mr. Farquhar; to be delivered up, with all its accumulative
interest, when the prodigal should have proved his penitence by his conduct.</DD>

<DD>
When Ruth had no call upon her time, it was indeed a holiday at Chapel-house.
She threw off as much as she could of the care and sadness in which she
had been sharing; and returned fresh and helpful, ready to go about in
her soft, quiet way, and fill up every measure of service, and heap it
with the fragrance of her own sweet nature. The delicate mending, that
the elder women could no longer see to do, was put by for Ruth's swift
and nimble fingers. The occasional copying, or patient writing to dictation,
that gave rest to Mr. Benson's weary spine, was done by her with sunny
alacrity. But, most of all, Leonard's heart rejoiced when his mother came
home. Then came the quiet confidences, the tender exchange of love, the
happy walks from which he returned stronger and stronger--going from strength
to strength as his mother led the way. It was well, as they saw now, that
the great shock of the disclosure had taken place when it did. She, for
her part, wondered at her own cowardliness in having even striven to keep
back the truth from her child--the truth that was so certain to be made
clear, sooner or later, and which it was only owing to God's mercy that
she was alive to encounter with him, and, by so encountering, shield and
give him good courage. Moreover, in her secret heart, she was thankful
that all occurred while he was yet too young to have much curiosity as
to his father. If an unsatisfied feeling of this kind occasionally stole
into his mind, at any rate she never heard any expression of it; for the
past was a sealed book between them. And so, in the bright strength of
good endeavour, the days went on, and grew again to months and years. Perhaps
one little circumstance which occurred during this time had scarcely external
importance enough to be called an event; but in Mr. Benson's mind it took
rank as such. One day, about a year after Richard Bradshaw had ceased to
be a partner in his father's house, Mr. Benson encountered Mr. Farquhar
in the street, and heard from him of the creditable and respectable manner
in which Richard was conducting himself in Glasgow, where Mr. Farquhar
had lately been on business.</DD>

<DD>
"I am determined to tell his father of this," said he; "I think his family
are far too obedient to his tacit prohibition of all mention of Richard's
name."</DD>

<DD>
"Tacit prohibition?" inquired Mr. Benson.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh! I dare say I use the words in a wrong sense for the correctness of
a scholar; but what I mean is, that he made a point of immediately leaving
the room if Richard's name was mentioned; and did it in so marked a manner,
that by degrees they understood that it was their father's desire that
he should never be alluded to; which was all very well as long as there
was nothing pleasant to be said about him; but to-night I am going there,
and shall take good care he does not escape me before I have told him all
I have heard and observed about Richard. He will never be a hero of virtue,
for his education has drained him of all moral courage; but with care,
and the absence of all strong temptation for a time, he will do very well;
nothing to gratify paternal pride, but certainly nothing to be ashamed
of."</DD>

<DD>
It was on the Sunday after this that the little circumstance to which I
have alluded took place.</DD>

<DD>
During the afternoon service, Mr. Benson became aware that the large Bradshaw
pew was no longer unoccupied. In a dark corner Mr. Bradshaw's white head
was to be seen, bowed down low in prayer. When last he had worshipped there,
the hair on that head was iron-grey, and even in prayer he had stood erect,
with an air of conscious righteousness sufficient for all his wants, and
even some to spare with which to judge others. Now, that white and hoary
head was never uplifted; part of his unobtrusiveness might, it is true,
be attributed to the uncomfortable feeling which was sure to attend any
open withdrawal of the declaration he had once made, never to enter the
chapel in which Mr. Benson was minister again; and as such a feeling was
natural to all men, and especially to such a one as Mr. Bradshaw, Mr. Benson
instinctively respected it, and passed out of the chapel with his household,
without ever directing his regards to the obscure place where Mr. Bradshaw
still remained immovable.</DD>

<DD>
From this day Mi.. Benson felt sure that the old friendly feeling existed
once more between them, although some time might elapse before any circumstance
gave the signal for a renewal of their intercourse.</DD>
