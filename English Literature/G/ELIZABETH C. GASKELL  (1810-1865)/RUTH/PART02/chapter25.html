<DD>
Mr. Bradshaw had been successful in carrying his point. His member had
been returned; his proud opponents mortified. So the public thought he
ought to be well pleased; but the public were disappointed to see that
he did not show any of the gratification they supposed him to feel.</DD>

<DD>
The truth was, that he met with so many small mortifications during the
progress of the election, that the pleasure which he would otherwise have
felt in the final success of his scheme was much diminished.</DD>

<DD>
He had more than tacitly sanctioned bribery; and now that the excitement
was over, he regretted it: not entirely from conscientious motives, though
he was uneasy from the slight sense of wrong-doing; but he was more pained,
after all, to think that, in the eyes of some of his townsmen, his hitherto
spotless character had received a blemish. He, who had been so stern and
severe a censor on the undue influence exercised by the opposite party
in all preceding elections, could not expect to be spared by their adherents
now, when there were rumours that the hands of the scrupulous Dissenters
were not clean. Before, it had been his beast that neither friend nor enemy
could say one word against him; now, he was constantly afraid of an indictment
for bribery, and of being compelled to appear before a committee to swear
to his own share in the business.</DD>

<DD>
His uneasy, fearful consciousness made him stricter and sterner than ever;
as if he would quench all wondering, slanderous talk about him in the town
by a renewed austerity of uprightness: that the slack-principled Mr. Bradshaw
of one month of ferment and excitement might not be confounded with the
highly conscientious and deeply religious Mr. Bradshaw, who went to chapel
twice a day, and gave a hundred pounds apiece to every charity in the town,
as a sort of thank-offering that his end was gained.</DD>

<DD>
But he was secretly dissatisfied with Mr. Donne. In general, that gentleman
had been rather too willing to act in accordance with any one's advice,
no matter whose; as, if he had thought it too much trouble to weigh the
wisdom of his friends, in which case Mr. Bradshaw's would have, doubtless,
proved the most valuable. But now and then he unexpectedly, and utterly
without reason, took the conduct of affairs into his own hands, as when
he had been absent without leave only just before the day of nomination.
No one guessed whither he had gone; but the fact of his being gone was
enough to chagrin Mr. Bradshaw, who was quite ready to have picked a quarrel
on this very head if the election had not terminated favourably. As it
was, he had a feeling of proprietorship in Mr. Donne which was not disagreeable.
He had given the new M.P. his seat; his resolution; his promptitude, his
energy, had made Mr. Donne "our member;" and Mr. Bradshaw began to feel
proud of him accordingly. But there had been no one circumstance during
this period to bind Jemima and Mr. Farquhar together. They were still misunderstanding
each other with all their power. The difference in the result was this
Jemima loved him all the more, in spite of quarrels and coolness. He was
growing utterly weary of the petulant temper of which he was never certain;
of the reception which varied day after day, according to the mood she
was in and the thoughts that were uppermost; and he was almost startled
to find how very glad he was that the little girls and Mrs. Denbigh were
coming home. His was a character to bask in peace; and lovely, quiet Ruth,
with her low tones and soft replies, her delicate waving movements, appeared
to him the very type of what a woman should be--a calm, serene soul, fashioning
the body to angelic grace.</DD>

<DD>
It was, therefore, with no slight interest that Mr. Farquhar inquired daily
after the health of little Leonard. He asked at the Bensons' house; and
Sally answered him, with swollen and tearful eyes, that the child was very
bad--very bad indeed. He asked at the doctor's; and the doctor told him,
in a few short words, that "it was only a bad kind of measles and that
the lad might have a struggle for it, but he thought he would get through.
Vigorous children carried their force into everything; never did things
by halves; if they were ill, they were sure to be in a high fever directly;
if they were well, there was no peace in the house for their rioting. For
his part," continued the doctor, "he thought he was glad he had had no
children; as far as he could judge, they were pretty much all plague and
no profit." But as he ended his speech he sighed; and Mr. Farquhar was
none the less convinced that common report was true, which represented
the clever, prosperous surgeon of Eccleston as bitterly disappointed at
his failure of offspring.</DD>

<DD>
While these various interests and feelings had their course outside the
Chapel-house, within there was but one thought which possessed all the
inmates. When Sally was not cooking for the little invalid, she was crying;
for she had had a dream about green rushes, not three months ago, which,
by some queer process of oneiromancy, she interpreted to mean the death
of a child; and all Miss Benson's endeavours were directed to making her
keep silence to Ruth about this dream. Sally thought that the mother ought
to be told. What were dreams sent for but for warnings? But it was just
like a pack of Dissenters, who would not believe anything like other folks.
Miss Benson was too much accustomed to Sally's contempt for Dissenters,
as viewed from the pinnacle of the Establishment, to pay much attention
to all this grumbling; especially as Sally was willing to take as much
trouble about Leonard as if she believed he was going to live, and that
his recovery depended upon her care. Miss Benson's great object was to
keep her from having any confidential talks with Ruth; as if any repetition
of the dream could have deepened the conviction in Ruth's mind that the
child would die.</DD>

<DD>
It seemed to her that his death would only be the fitting punishment for
the state of indifference towards him--towards life and death--towards
all things earthly or divine, into which she had suffered herself to fall
since her last interview with Mr. Donne. She did not understand that such
exhaustion is but the natural consequence of violent agitation and severe
tension of feeling. The only relief she experienced was in constantly serving
Leonard; she had almost an animal's jealousy lest any one should come between
her and her young. Mr. Benson saw this jealous suspicion, although he could
hardly understand it; but he calmed his sister's wonder and officious kindness,
so that the two patiently and quietly provided all that Ruth might want,
but did not interfere with her right to nurse Leonard. But when he was
recovering, Mr. Benson, with the slight tone of authority he knew how to
assume when need was, bade Ruth lie down and take some rest, while his
sister watched. Ruth did not answer, but obeyed in a dull, weary kind of
surprise at being so commanded. She lay down by her child, gazing her fill
at his calm slumber; and, as she gazed, her large white eye lids were softly
pressed down as with a gentle, irresistible weight, and she fell asleep.</DD>

<DD>
She dreamed that she was once more on the lonely shore, striving to carry
away Leonard from some pursuer--some human pursuer--she knew he was human,
and she knew who he was, although she dared not say his name even to herself,
he seemed so close and present, gaining on her flying footsteps, rushing
after her as with the sound of the roaring tide. Her feet seemed heavy
weights fixed to the ground; they would not move. All at once, just near
the shore, a great black whirlwind of waves clutched her back to her pursuer;
she threw Leonard on to land, which was safety; but whether he reached
it or no, or was swept back like her into a mysterious something too dreadful
to he borne, she did not know, for the terror awakened her. At first the
dream seemed yet a reality, and she thought that the pursuer was couched
even there, in that very room, and the great boom of the sea was still
in her ears. But as full consciousness returned, she saw herself safe in
the dear old room--the haven of rest--the shelter from storms. A bright
fire was glowing in the little old-fashioned, cup-shaped grate, niched
into a corner of the wall, and guarded on either side by whitewashed bricks,
which served for bobs. On one of these the kettle hummed and buzzed, within
two points of boiling whenever she or Leonard required tea. In her dream
that home-like sound had been the roar of the relentless sea, creeping
swiftly on to seize its prey. Miss Benson sat by the fire, motionless and
still; it was too dark to read any longer without a candle; but yet on
the ceiling and upper part of the walls the golden light of the setting
sun was slowly moving--so slow, and yet a motion gives the feeling of rest
to the weary yet more than perfect stillness. The old clock on the staircase
told its monotonous click-clack, in that soothing way which more marked
the quiet of the house than disturbed with any sense of sound. Leonard
still slept that renovating slumber, almost in her arms, far from that
fatal pursuing sea, with its human form of cruelty. The dream was a vision;
the reality which prompted the dream was over and past--Leonard was safe--she
was safe; all this loosened the frozen springs, and they gushed forth in
her heart, and her lips moved in accordance with her thoughts.</DD>

<DD>
"What were you saying, my darling?" said Miss Benson, who caught sight
of the motion, and fancied she was asking for something. Miss Benson bent
over the side of the bed on which Ruth lay, to catch the low tones of her
voice.</DD>

<DD>
"I only said," replied Ruth timidly, "thank God! I have so much to thank
Him for you don't know."</DD>

<DD>
"My dear, I am sure we have all of us cause to be thankful that our boy
is spared. See! he is wakening up; and we will have a cup of tea together.</DD>

<DD>
Leonard strode on to perfect health; but he was made older in character
and looks by his severe illness. He grew tall and thin, and the lovely
child was lost in the handsome boy. He began to wonder and to question.
Ruth mourned a little over the vanished babyhood, when she was all in all,
and over the childhood, whose petals had fallen away; it seemed as though
two of her children were gone--the one an infant, the other a bright, thoughtless
darling; and she wished that they could have remained quick in her memory
for ever, instead of being absorbed in loving pride for the present boy.
But these were only fanciful regrets, flitting like shadows across a mirror.
Peace and thankfulness were once more the atmosphere of her mind; nor was
her unconsciousness disturbed by any suspicion of Mr. Farquhar's increasing
approbation and admiration, which he was diligently nursing up into love
for her. She knew that he had sent--she did not know how often he had brought--fruit
for the convalescent Leonard. She heard, on her return from her daily employment,
that Mr. Farquhar had bought a little gentle pony on which Leonard, weak
as he was, might ride. To confess the truth, her maternal pride was such
that she thought that all kindness shown to such a boy as Leonard was but
natural; she believed him to be</DD>

<DD>
"A child whom all that locked on, loved."</DD>

<DD>
As in truth he was; and the proof of this was daily shown in many kind
inquiries, and many thoughtful little offerings, besides Mr. Farquhar's.
The poor (warm and kind of heart to all sorrow common to humanity) were
touched with pity for the young widow, whose only child lay ill, and nigh
unto death. They brought what they could--a fresh egg, when eggs were scarce--a
few ripe pears that grew on the sunniest side of the humblest cottage,
where the fruit was regarded as a source of income--a call of inquiry,
and a prayer that God would spare the child, from an old crippled woman,
who could scarcely drag herself so far as the Chapel-house, yet felt her
worn and weary heart stirred with a sharp pang of sympathy, and a very
present remembrance of the time when she too was young, and saw the life-breath
quiver out of her child, now an angel in that heaven which felt more like
home to the desolate old creature than this empty earth. To all such, when
Leonard was better, Ruth went, and thanked them from her heart. She and
the old cripple sat hand in hand over the scanty fire on the hearth of
the latter, while she told in solemn, broken, homely words, how her child
sickened and died. Tears fell like rain down Ruth's cheeks; but those of
the old woman were dry. All tears had been wept out of her long ago, and
now she sat patient and quiet, waiting for death. But after this Ruth "clave
unto her," and the two were henceforward a pair of friends. Mr. Farquhar
was only included in the general gratitude which she felt towards all who
had been kind to her boy.</DD>

<DD>
The winter passed away in deep peace after the storms of the autumn, yet
every now and then a feeling of insecurity made Ruth shake for an instant.
Those wild autumnal storms had torn aside the quiet flowers and herbage
that had gathered over the wreck of her early life, and shown her that
all deeds, however hidden and long passed by, have their eternal consequences.
She turned sick and faint whenever Mr. Donne's name was casually mentioned.
No one saw it; but she felt the miserable stop in her heart's beating,
and wished that she could prevent it by any exercise of self-command. She
had never named his identity with Mr. Bellingham, nor had she spoken about
the seaside interview. Deep shame made her silent and reserved on all her
life before Leonard's birth; from that time she rose again in her self-respect,
and spoke as openly as a child (when need was) of all occurrences which
had taken place since then; except that she could not, and would not, tell
of this mocking echo, this haunting phantom, this past, that would not
rest in its grave. The very circumstance that it was stalking abroad in
the world, and might reappear at any moment, made her a coward: she trembled
away from contemplating what the reality had been; only, she clung more
faithfully than before to the thought of the great God, who was a rock
in the dreary land, where no shadow was.</DD>

<DD>
Autumn and winter, with their lowering skies, were less dreary than the
woeful, desolate feelings that shed a gloom on Jemima. She found too late
that she had considered Mr. Farquhar so securely her own for so long a
time, that her heart refused to recognize him as lost to her, unless her
reason went through the same weary, convincing, miserable evidence day
after day, and hour after hour. He never spoke to her now, except from
common civility. He never cared for her contradictions; he never tried,
with patient perseverance, to bring her over to his opinions; he never
used the wonted wiles (so tenderly remembered now they had no existence
but in memory) to bring her round out of some wilful mood--and such moods
were common enough now! Frequently she was sullenly indifferent to the
feelings of others--not from any unkindness, but because her heart seemed
numb and stony, and incapable of sympathy. Then afterwards her self-reproach
was terrible--in the dead of night when no one saw it. With a strange perversity,
the only intelligence she cared to hear, the only sights she cared to see,
were the circumstances which gave confirmation to the idea that Mr. Farquhar
was thinking of Ruth for a wife. She craved with stinging curiosity to
hear something of their affairs every day; partly because the torture which
such intelligence gave was almost a relief from the deadness of her heart
to all other interests.</DD>

<DD>
And so spring (<I>gioventu dell'anno</I>) came back to her, bringing all
the contrasts which spring alone can bring to add to the heaviness of the
soul. The little winged creatures filled the air with bursts of joy; the
vegetation came bright and hopefully onwards, without any check of nipping
frost. The ash-trees in the Bradshaws' garden were out in leaf by the middle
of May, which that year wore more the aspect of summer than most Junes
do. The sunny weather mocked Jemima, and the unusual warmth oppressed her
physical powers. She felt very weak and languid; she was acutely sensible
that no one else noticed her want of strength; father, mother, all seemed
too full of other things to care, if, as she believed, her life was waning.
She herself felt glad that it was so. But her delicacy was not unnoticed
by all. Her mother often anxiously asked her husband if he did not think
Jemima was looking ill; nor did his affirmation to the contrary satisfy
her, as most of his affirmations did. She thought every morning, before
she got up, how she could tempt Jemima to eat, by ordering some favourite
dainty for dinner; in many other little ways she tried to minister to her
child; but the poor girl's own abrupt irritability of temper had made her
mother afraid of openly speaking to her about her health.</DD>

<DD>
Ruth, too, saw that Jemima was not looking well. How she had become an
object of dislike to her former friend she did not know; but she was sensible
that Miss Bradshaw disliked her now. She was not aware that this feeling
was growing and strengthening almost into repugnance, for she seldom saw
Jemima out of school-hours, and then only for a minute or two. But the
evil element of a fellow-creature's dislike oppressed the atmosphere of
her life. That fellow-creature was one who had once loved her so fondly,
and whom she still loved, although she had learnt to fear her, as we fear
those whose faces cloud over when we come in sight--who cast unloving glances
at us, of which we, though not seeing, are conscious, as of some occult
influence; and the cause of whose dislike is unknown to us, though every
word and action seems to increase it. I believe that this sort of dislike
is only shown by the jealous, and that it renders the disliker even more
miserable, because more continually conscious than the object; but the
growing evidences of Jemima's feeling made Ruth very unhappy at times.
This very May, too, an idea had come into her mind, which she had tried
to repress--namely, that Mr. Farquhar was in love with her. It annoyed
her extremely; it made her reproach herself that she ever should think
such a thing possible. She tried to strangle the notion, to drown it, to
starve it out by neglect--its existence caused her such pain and distress.</DD>

<DD>
The worst was, he had won Leonard's heart, who was constantly seeking him
out; or, when absent, talking about him. The best was some journey connected
with business, which would take him to the Continent for several weeks;
and, during that time, surely this disagreeable fancy of his would die
away, if untrue; and if true, some way would be opened by which she might
put a stop to all increase of predilection on his part, and yet retain
him as a friend for Leonard--that darling for whom she was far-seeing and
covetous, and miserly of every scrap of love and kindly regard.</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Farquhar would not have been flattered, if he had known how much his
departure contributed to Ruth's rest of mind on the Saturday afternoon
on which he set out on his journey. It was a beautiful day; the sky of
that intense quivering blue, which seemed as though you could look through
it for ever, yet not reach the black, infinite space which is suggested
as lying beyond. Now and then, a thin, torn, vaporous cloud floated slowly
within the vaulted depth; but the soft air that gently wafted it was not
perceptible among the leaves on the trees, which did not even tremble.
Ruth sat at her work in the shadow formed by the old grey garden wall;
Miss Benson and Sally--the one in the parlour window-seat mending stockings,
the other hard at work in her kitchen--were both within talking distance,
for it was weather for open doors and windows; but none of the three kept
up any continued conversation; and in the intervals Ruth sang low a brooding
song, such as she remembered her mother singing long ago. Now and then
she stopped to look at Leonard, who was labouring away with vehement energy
at digging over a small plot of ground, where he meant to prick out some
celery plants that had been given to him. Ruth's heart warmed at the earnest,
spirited way in which he thrust his large spade deep down into the brown
soil his ruddy face glowing, his curly hair wet with the exertion; and
yet she sighed to think that the days were over when her deeds of skill
could give him pleasure. Now, his delight was in acting himself; last year,
not fourteen months ago, he had watched her making a daisy-chain for him,
as if he could not admire her cleverness enough; this year, this week,
when she had been devoting every spare hour to the simple tailoring which
she performed for her boy (she had always made every article he wore, and
felt almost jealous of the employment), he had come to her with a wistful
look, and asked when he might begin to have clothes made by a man?</DD>

<DD>
Ever since the Wednesday when she had accompanied Mary and Elizabeth, at
Mrs. Bradshaw's desire, to be measured for spring clothes by the new Eccleston
dress-maker, she had been looking forward to this Saturday afternoon's
pleasure of making summer trousers for Leonard; but the satisfaction of
the employment was a little taken away by Leonard's speech. It was a sign,
however, that her life was very quiet and peaceful, that she had leisure
to think upon the thing at. all; and often she forgot it entirely in her
low, chanting song, or in listening to the thrush warbling out his afternoon
ditty to his patient mate in the holly-bush below.</DD>

<DD>
The distant rumble of carts through the busy streets (it was market-day)
not only formed a low rolling bass to the nearer and pleasanter sounds,
but enhanced the sense of peace by the suggestion of the contrast afforded
to the repose of the garden by the bustle not far off.</DD>

<DD>
But, besides physical din and bustle, there is mental strife and turmoil.</DD>

<DD>
That afternoon, as Jemima was restlessly wandering about the house, her
mother desired her to go on an errand to Mrs. Pearson's, the new dressmaker,
in order to give some directions about her sisters' new frocks. Jemima
went, rather than have the trouble of resisting; or else she would have
preferred staying at home, moving or being outwardly quiet according to
her own fitful will. Mrs. Bradshaw, who, as I have said, had been aware
for some time that something was wrong with her daughter, and was very
anxious to set it to rights if she only knew how, had rather planned this
errand with a view to dispel Jemima's melancholy.</DD>

<DD>
"And, Mimie dear," said her mother, "when you are there, look out for a
new bonnet for yourself; she has got some very pretty ones, and your old
one is so shabby."</DD>

<DD>
"It does for me, mother," said Jemima heavily. "I don't want a new bonnet."</DD>

<DD>
"But I want you to have one, my lassie. I want my girl to look well and
nice."</DD>

<DD>
There was something of homely tenderness in Mrs. Bradshaw's tone that touched
Jemima's heart. She went to her mother, and kissed her with more of affection
than she had shown to any one for weeks before; and the kiss was returned
with warm fondness.</DD>

<DD>
"I think you love me, mother," said Jemima.</DD>

<DD>
"We all love you, dear, if you would but think so. And if you want anything,
or wish for anything, only tell me, and with a little patience, I can get
your father to give it you, I know. Only be happy, there's a good girl."</DD>

<DD>
"Be happy! as if one could by an effort of will!" thought Jemima as she
went along the street, too absorbed in herself to notice the bows of acquaintances
and friends, but instinctively guiding herself right among the throng and
press of carts, and gigs, and market people in High Street.</DD>

<DD>
But her mother's tones and looks, with their comforting power, remained
longer in her recollection than the inconsistency of any words spoken.
When she had completed her errand about the frocks, she asked to look at
some bonnets, in order to show her recognition of her mother's kind thought.</DD>

<DD>
Mrs. Pearson was a smart, clever-looking woman of five or six and thirty.
She had all the variety of small-talk at her finger-ends, that was formerly
needed by barbers to amuse the people who came to be shaved. She had admired
the town till Jemima was weary of its praises, sick and oppressed by its
sameness, as she had been these many weeks.</DD>

<DD>
"Here are some bonnets, ma'am, that will be just the thing for you--elegant
and tasty, yet quite of the simple style, suitable to young ladies. Oblige
me by trying on this white silk!"</DD>

<DD>
Jemima looked at herself in the glass; she was obliged to own it was very
becoming, and perhaps not the less so for the flush of modest shame which
came into her cheeks, as she heard Mrs. Pearson's open praises of the "rich,
beautiful hair," and the "Oriental eyes" of the wearer.</DD>

<DD>
"I induced the young lady who accompanied your sisters the other day--the
governess, is she, ma'am?"</DD>

<DD>
"Yes--Mrs. Denbigh is her name," said Jemima, clouding over.</DD>

<DD>
"Thank you, ma'am. Well, I persuaded Mrs. Denbigh to try on that bonnet,
and you can't think how charming she looked in it; and yet I don't think
it became her as much as it does you."</DD>

<DD>
"Mrs. Denbigh is very beautiful," said Jemima, taking off the bonnet, and
not much inclined to try on any other.</DD>

<DD>
"Very, ma'am. Quite a peculiar style of beauty. If I might be allowed,
I should say that hers was a Grecian style of loveliness, while yours was
Oriental. She reminded me of a young person I once knew in Fordham." Mrs.
Pearson sighed an audible sigh.</DD>

<DD>
"In Fordham!" said Jemima, remembering that Ruth had once spoken of the
place as one in which she had spent some time, while the county in which
it was situated was the same in which Ruth was born. "In Fordham! Why,
I think Mrs. Denbigh comes from that neighbourhood."</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, ma'am! she cannot be the young person I mean--I am sure, ma'am--holding
the position she does in your establishment. I should hardly say I knew
her myself; for I only saw her two or three times at my sister's house;
but she was so remarked for her beauty, that I remember her face quite
well--the more so, on account of her vicious conduct afterwards."</DD>

<DD>
"Her vicious conduct!" repeated Jemima, convinced by these words that there
could be no identity between Ruth and "young person" alluded to. "Then
it could not have been our Mrs. Denbigh."</DD>

<DD>
"Oh no, ma'am! I am sure I should be sorry to be understood to have suggested
anything of the kind. I beg your pardon if I did so. All I meant to say--and
perhaps that was a liberty I ought not to have taken, considering what
Ruth Hilton was----"</DD>

<DD>
"Ruth Hilton!" said Jemima, turning suddenly round, and facing Mrs. Pearson.</DD>

<DD>
"Yes, ma'am, that was the name of the young person I allude to."</DD>

<DD>
"Tell me about her--what did she do?" asked Jemima, subduing her eagerness
of tone and look as best she might, but trembling as on the verge of some
strange discovery.</DD>

<DD>
"I don't know whether I ought to tell you, ma'am--it is hardly a fit story
for a young lady; but this Ruth Hilton was an apprentice to my sister-in-law,
who had a first-rate business in Fordham, which brought her a good deal
of patronage from the county families; and this young creature was very
artful and bold, and thought sadly too much of her beauty; and, somehow,
she beguiled a young gentleman, who took her into keeping (I am sure, ma'am,
I ought to apologise for polluting your ears)----"</DD>

<DD>
"Go on," said Jemima breathlessly.</DD>

<DD>
"I don't know much more. His mother followed him into Wales. She was a
lady of a great deal of religion, and a very old family, and was much shocked
at her son's misfortune in being captivated by such a person; but she led
him to repentance, and took him to Paris, where, I think, she died; but
I am not sure, for, owing to family differences, I have not been on terms
for some years with my sister-in-law, who was my informant."</DD>

<DD>
"Who died?" interrupted Jemima--"the young man's mother, or--or Ruth Hilton?"</DD>

<DD>
"Oh dear, ma'am! pray don't confuse the two. It was the mother, Mrs. ----
I forget the name--something like Billington. It was the lady who died."</DD>

<DD>
"And what became of the other?" asked Jemima, unable, as her dark suspicion
seemed thickening, to speak the name.</DD>

<DD>
"The girl? Why, ma'am, what could become of her? Not that I know exactly--only
one knows they can but go from bad to worse, poor creatures! God forgive
me, if I am speaking too transiently of such degraded women, who, after
all, are a disgrace to our sex."</DD>

<DD>
"Then you know nothing more about her?" asked Jemima.</DD>

<DD>
"I did hear that she had gone off with another gentleman that she met with
in Wales, but I'm sure I can't tell who told me."</DD>

<DD>
There was a little pause. Jemima was pondering on all she had heard. Suddenly
she felt that Mrs. Pearson's eyes were upon her, watching her; not with
curiosity, but with a newly-awakened intelligence;--and yet she must ask
one more question; but she tried to ask it in an Indifferent, careless
tone, handling the bonnet while she spoke.</DD>

<DD>
"How long is it since all this--all you have been telling me about--happened!"
(Leonard was eight years old.)</DD>

<DD>
"Why--let me see. It was before I was married, and I was married three
years, and poor dear Pearson has been deceased five--I should say going
on for nine years this summer. Blush roses would become your complexion,
perhaps, better than these lilacs," said she, as with superficial observation
she watched Jemima turning the bonnet round and round on her hand--the
bonnet that her dizzy eyes did not see.</DD>

<DD>
"Thank you. It is very pretty. But I don't want a bonnet. I beg your pardon
for taking up your time." And with an abrupt bow to the discomfited Mrs.
Pearson, she was out and away in the open air, threading her way with instinctive
energy along the crowded street. Suddenly she turned round, and went back
to Mrs. Pearson's with even more rapidity than she had been walking away
from the house.</DD>

<DD>
"I have changed my mind," said she, as she came, breathless, up into the
show-room. "I will take the bonnet. How much is it?"</DD>

<DD>
"Allow me to change the flowers; it can be done in an instant, and then
you can see if you would not prefer the roses; but with either foliage
it is a lovely little bonnet," said Mrs. Pearson, holding it up admiringly
on her hand.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh! never mind the flowers--yes! change them to the roses." And she stood
by, agitated (Mrs. Pearson thought with impatience), all the time the milliner
was making the alteration with skilful, busy haste.</DD>

<DD>
"By the way," said Jemima, when she saw the last touches were being given,
and that she must not delay executing the purpose which was the real cause
of her return--"Papa, I am sure, would not like your connecting Mrs. Denbigh's
name with such a--story as you have been telling me."</DD>

<DD>
"Oh dear! ma'am, I have too much respect for you all to think of doing
such a thing! Of course I know, ma'am, that it is not to be cast up to
any lady that she is like any-body disreputable."</DD>

<DD>
"But I would rather you did not name the likeness to any one," said Jemima;
"not to any one. Don't tell any one the story you have told me this morning."</DD>

<DD>
"Indeed, ma'am, I should never think of such a thing! My poor husband could
have borne witness that I am as close as the grave where there is anything
to conceal."</DD>

<DD>
"Oh dear!" said Jemima, "Mrs. Pearson, there is nothing to conceal; only
you must not speak about it."</DD>

<DD>
"I certainly shall not do it, ma'am; you may rest assured of me."</DD>

<DD>
This time Jemima did not go towards home, but in the direction of the outskirts
of the town, on the hilly side. She had some dim recollection of hearing
her sisters ask if they might not go and invite Leonard and his mother
to tea; and how could she face Ruth, after the conviction had taken possession
of her heart that she, and the sinful creature she bad just heard of, were
one and the same?</DD>

<DD>
It was yet only the middle of the afternoon; the hours were early in the
old-fashioned town of Eccleston. Soft white clouds had come slowly sailing
up out of the west; the plain was flecked with thin floating shadows, gently
borne along by the westerly wind that was waving the long grass in the
hay-fields into alternate light and shade. Jemima went into one of these
fields, lying by the side of the upland road. She was stunned by the shock
she had received. The diver leaving the green sward, smooth and known,
where his friends stand with their familiar smiling faces, admiring his
glad bravery--the diver, down in an instant in the horrid depths of the
sea, close to some strange, ghastly, lidless-eyed monster, can hardly more
feel his blood curdle at the near terror than did Jemima now. Two hours
ago--but a point of time on her mind's dial--she had never Imagined that
she should ever come in contact with any one who had committed open sin;
she had never shaped her conviction into words and sentences, but still
it was <I>there</I>, that all the respectable, all the family and religious
circumstances of her life, would hedge her in, and guard her from ever
encountering the great shock of coming face to face with Vice. Without
being pharisaical in her estimation of herself, she had all a Pharisee's
dread of publicans and sinners, and all a child's cowardliness--that cowardliness
which prompts it to shut its eyes against the object of terror, rather
than acknowledge its existence with brave faith. Her father's often reiterated
speeches had not been without their effect. He drew a clear line of partition,
which separated mankind into two great groups, to one of which, by the
grace of God, he and his belonged; while the other was composed of those
whom it was his duty to try and reform, and bring the whole force of his
morality to bear upon, with lectures, admonitions, and exhortations--a
duty to be performed, because it was a duty--but with very little of that
Hope and Faith which is the Spirit that maketh alive. Jemima had rebelled
against these hard doctrines of her father's, but their frequent repetition
had had its effect, and led her to look upon those who had gone astray
with shrinking, shuddering recoil, instead of with a pity so Christ-like
as to have both wisdom and tenderness in it.</DD>

<DD>
And now she saw among her own familiar associates one, almost her house-fellow,
who had been stained with that evil most repugnant to her womanly modesty,
that would fain have ignored its existence altogether. She loathed the
thought of meeting Ruth again. She wished that she could take her up, and
put her down at a distance somewhere--anywhere--where she might never see
or hear of her more; never be reminded, as she must be whenever she saw
her, that such things were in this sunny, bright, lark-singing earth, over
which the blue dome of heaven bent softly down as Jemima sat in the hay-field
that June afternoon; her cheeks flushed and red, but her lips pale and
compressed, and her eyes full of a heavy, angry sorrow. It was Saturday,
and the people in that part of the country left their work an hour earlier
on that day. By this, Jemima knew it must be growing time for her to be
at home. She had had so much of conflict in her own mind of late, that
she had grown to dislike struggle, or speech, or explanation; and so strove
to conform to times and hours much more than she had done in happier days.
But oh! how full of hate her heart was growing against the world! And oh!
how she sickened at the thought of seeing Ruth! Who was to be trusted more,
if Ruth--calm, modest, delicate, dignified Ruth--had a memory blackened
by sin?</DD>

<DD>
As she went heavily along, the thought of Mr. Farquhar came into her mind.
It showed how terrible had been the stun, that he had been forgotten until
now. With the thought of him came in her first merciful feeling towards
Ruth. This would never have been, had there been the least latent suspicion
in Jemima's jealous mind that Ruth had purposely done aught--looked a look--uttered
a word--modulated a tone--for the sake of attracting. As Jemima recalled
all the passages of their intercourse, she slowly confessed to herself
how pure and simple had been all Ruth's ways in relation to Mr. Farquhar.
It was not merely that there had been no coquetting, but there had been
simple unconsciousness on Ruth's part, for so long a time after Jemima
bad discovered Mr. Farquhar's inclination for her; and, when at length
she had slowly awakened to some perception of the state of his feelings,
there had been a modest, shrinking dignity of manner, not startled, or
emotional, or even timid, but pure, grave, and quiet; and this conduct
of Ruth's Jemima instinctively acknowledged to be of necessity transparent
and sincere. Now, and here, there was no hypocrisy; but some time, somewhere,
on the part of somebody, what hypocrisy, what lies must have been acted,
if not absolutely spoken, before Ruth could have been received by them
all as the sweet, gentle, girlish widow, which she remembered they had
all believed Mrs. Denbigh to be when first she came among them! Could Mr.
and Miss Benson know? Could they be a party to the deceit? Not sufficiently
acquainted with the world to understand how strong had been the temptation
to play the part they did, if they wished to give Ruth a chance, Jemima
could not believe them guilty of such deceit as the knowledge of Mrs. Denbigh's
previous conduct would imply; and yet how it darkened the latter into a
treacherous hypocrite, with a black secret shut up in her soul for years--living
in apparent confidence, and daily household familiarity with the Bensons
for years, yet never telling the remorse that ought to be corroding her
heart! Who was true? Who was not? Who was good and pure? Who was not? The
very foundations of Jemima's belief in her mind were shaken.</DD>

<DD>
Could it be false? Could there be two Ruth Hiltons? She went over every
morsel of evidence. It could not be. She knew that Mrs. Denbigh's former
name had been Hilton. She had heard her speak casually, but charily, of
having lived in Fordham. She knew she had been in Wales but a short time
before she made her appearance in Eccleston. There was no doubt of the
identity. Into the middle of Jemima's pain and horror at the afternoon's
discovery, there came a sense of the power which the knowledge of this
secret gave her over Ruth; but this was no relief, only an aggravation
of the regret with which Jemima looked back on her state of ignorance.
It was no wonder that when she arrived at home, she was so oppressed with
headache that she had to go to bed directly.</DD>

<DD>
"Quiet, mother! quiet, dear, dear mother" (for she clung to the known and
tried goodness of her mother more than ever now), "that is all I want."
And she was left to the stillness of her darkened room, the blinds idly
flapping to and fro in the soft evening breeze, and letting in the rustling
sound of the branches which waved close to her window, and the thrush's
gurgling warble, and the distant hum of the busy town.</DD>

<DD>
Her jealousy was gone--she knew not how or where. She might shun and recoil
from Ruth, but she now thought that she could never more be jealous of
her. In her pride of innocence, she felt almost ashamed that such a feeling
could have had existence. Could Mr. Farquhar hesitate between her own self
and one who---- No! she could not name what Ruth had been, even in thought.
And yet he might never know, so fair a seeming did her rival wear. Oh!
for one ray of God's holy light to know what was seeming, and what was
truth, in this traitorous hollow earth! It might be--she used to think
such things possible, before sorrow had embittered her--that Ruth had worked
her way through the deep purgatory of repentance up to something like purity
again; God only knew! If her present goodness was real--if, after having
striven back thus far on the heights, a fellow-woman was to throw her down
into some terrible depth with her unkind, incontinent tongue, that would
be too cruel! And yet, if--there was such woeful uncertainty and deceit
somewhere--if Ruth---- No! that, Jemima with noble candour admitted, was
impossible. Whatever Ruth had been, she was good, and to be respected as
such, now. It did not follow that Jemima was to preserve the secret always;
she doubted her own power to do so, if Mr. Farquhar came home again, and
were still constant in his admiration of Mrs. Denbigh, and if Mrs. Denbigh
gave him any--the least encouragement. But this last she thought, from
what she knew of Ruth's character, was impossible. Only, what was impossible
after this afternoon's discovery? At any rate, she would watch and wait.
Come what might, Ruth was in her power. And, strange to say, this last
certainty gave Jemima a kind of protecting, almost pitying, feeling for
Ruth. Her horror at the wrong was not diminished; but, the more she thought
of the struggles that the wrong-doer must have made to extricate herself,
the more she felt how cruel it would be to baffle all by revealing what
had been. But for her sisters' sake she had a duty to perform; she must
watch Ruth. For her lover's sake she could not have helped watching; but
she was too much stunned to recognise the force of her love, while duty
seemed the only stable thing to cling to. For the present she would neither
meddle nor mar in Ruth's course of life.</DD>
