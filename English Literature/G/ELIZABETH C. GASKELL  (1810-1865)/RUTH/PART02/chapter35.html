The third night after this was to be the crisis--the turning-point between
Life and Death. Mr. Davis came again to pass it by the bedside of the sufferer.
Ruth was there, constant and still, intent upon watching the symptoms,
and acting according to them, in obedience to Mr. Davis's directions. She
had never left the room. Every sense had been strained in watching--every
power of thought or judgment had been kept on the full stretch. Now that
Mr. Davis came and took her place, and that the room was quiet for the
night, she became oppressed with heaviness, which yet did not tend to sleep.
She could not remember the present time, or where she was. All times of
her earliest youth--the days of her childhood--were in her memory with
a minuteness and fulness of detail which was miserable; for all along she
felt that she had no real grasp on the scenes that were passing through
her mind--that, somehow, they were long gone by, and gone by for ever--and
yet she could not remember who she was now, nor where she was, and whether
she had now any interests in life to take the place of those which she
was conscious had passed away, although their remembrance filled her mind
with painful acuteness. Her head lay on her arms, and they rested on the
table. Every now and then she opened her eyes, and saw the large room,
handsomely furnished with articles that were each one incongruous with
the other, as if bought at sales. She saw the flickering night-light--she
heard the ticking of the watch, and the two breathings, each going on at
a separate rate--one hurried, abruptly stopping, and then panting violently,
as if to make up for lost time; and the other slow, steady, and regular,
as if the breather was asleep; but this supposition was contradicted by
an occasional repressed sound of yawning. The sky through the uncurtained
window looked dark and black--would this night never have an end? Had the
sun gone down for ever, and would the world at last awaken to a general
sense of everlasting night?</DD>

<DD>
Then she felt as if she ought to get up, and go and see how the troubled
sleeper in yonder bed was struggling through his illness; but she could
not remember who the sleeper was, and she shrunk from seeing some phantom-face
on the pillow, such as now began to haunt the dark corners of the room,
and look at her, jibbering and mowing as they looked. So she covered her
face again, and sank into a whirling stupor of sense and feeling. By-and-by
she heard her fellow-watcher stirring, and a dull wonder stole over her
as to what he was doing; but the heavy languor pressed her down, and kept
her still. At last she heard the words, "Come here," and listlessly obeyed
the command. She had to steady herself in the rocking chamber before she
could walk to the bed by which Mr. Davis stood; but the effort to do so
roused her, and, though conscious of an oppressive headache, she viewed
with sudden and clear vision all the circumstances of her present position.
Mr. Davis was near the head of the bed, holding the night-lamp high, and
shading it with his hand, that it might not disturb the sick person, who
lay with his face towards them, in feeble exhaustion, but with every sign
that the violence of the fever had left him. It so happened that the rays
of the lamp fell bright and full upon Ruth's countenance, as she stood
with her crimson lips parted with the hurrying breath, and the fever-flush
brilliant on her cheeks. Her eyes were wide open, and their pupils distended.
She looked on the invalid in silence, and hardly understood why Mr. Davis
had summoned her there.</DD>

<DD>
"Don't you see the change" He is better!--the crisis is past!"</DD>

<DD>
But she did not speak her looks were riveted on his softly-unclosing eyes,
which met hers as they opened languidly. She could not stir or speak. She
was held fast by that gaze of his, in which a faint recognition dawned,
and grew to strength.</DD>

<DD>
He murmured some words. They strained their sense to hear. He repeated
them even lower than before; but this time they caught what he was saying.</DD>

<DD>
"Where are the water-lilies? Where are the lilies in her hair?"</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Davis drew Ruth away.</DD>

<DD>
"He is still rambling," said he. "But the fever has left him."</DD>

<DD>
The grey dawn was now filling the room with its cold light; was it that
made Ruth's cheek so deadly pale? Could that call out the wild entreaty
of her look, as if imploring help against some cruel foe that held her
fast, and was wrestling with her Spirit of Life? She held Mr. Davis's arm.
If she had let it go, she would have fallen.</DD>

<DD>
"Take me home," she said, and fainted dead away.</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Davis carried her out of the chamber, and sent the groom to keep watch
by his master. He ordered a fly to convey her to Mr. Benson's, and lifted
her in when it came, for she was still half unconscious. It was he who
carried her upstairs to her room, where Miss Benson and Sally undressed
and laid her in her bed.</DD>

<DD>
He awaited their proceedings in Mr. Benson's study. When Mr. Benson came
in, Mr. Davis said--</DD>

<DD>
"Don't blame me. Don't add to my self-reproach. I have killed her. I was
a cruel fool to let her go. Don't speak to me."</DD>

<DD>
"It may not be so bad," said Mr. Benson, himself needing comfort in that
shock. "She may recover. She surely will recover. I believe she will."</DD>

<DD>
"No, no! she won't. But by ---- she shall, if I can save her." Mr. Davis
looked defiantly at Mr. Benson, as if he were Fate. "I tell you she shall
recover, or else I am a murderer. What business had I to take her to nurse
him----"</DD>

<DD>
He was cut short by Sally's entrance and announcement, that Ruth was now
prepared to see him.</DD>

<DD>
From that time forward Mr. Davis devoted all his leisure, his skill, his
energy, to save her. He called on the rival surgeon, to beg him to undertake
the management of Mr. Donne's recovery, saying, with his usual self-mockery,
"I could not answer it to Mr. Cranworth if I had brought his opponent round,
you know, when I had had such a fine opportunity in my power. Now, with
your patients, and general Radical interest, it will be rather a feather
in your cap; for he may want a good deal of care yet, though he is getting
on famously--so rapidly, in fact, that it's a strong temptation to me to
throw him back--a relapse, you know."</DD>

<DD>
The other surgeon bowed gravely, apparently taking Mr. Davis in earnest,
but certainly very glad of the job thus opportunely thrown in his way.
In spite of Mr. Davis's real and deep anxiety about Ruth, he could not
help chuckling over his rival's literal interpretation of all he had said.</DD>

<DD>
"To be sure, what fools men are! I don't know why one should watch and
strive to keep them in the world. I have given this fellow something to
talk about confidently to all his patients; I wonder how much stronger
a dose the man would have swallowed! I must begin to take care of my practice
for that lad yonder. Well-a-day! well-a-day! What was this sick fine gentleman
sent here for, that she should run a chance of her life for him? or why
was he sent into the world at all, for that matter?"</DD>

<DD>
Indeed, however much Mr. Davis might labour with all his professional skill--however
much they might all watch--and pray--and weep--it was but too evident that
Ruth "home must go, and take her wages." Poor, poor Ruth!</DD>

<DD>
It might be that, utterly exhausted by watching and nursing, first in the
hospital, and than by the bedside of her former lover, the power of her
constitution was worn out; or, it might be, her gentle, pliant sweetness,
but she displayed no outrage or discord even in her delirium. There she
lay in the attic-room in which her baby had been born, her watch over him
kept, her confession to him made; and now she was stretched on the bed
in utter helplessness, softly gazing at vacancy with her open, unconscious
eyes, from which all the depth of their meaning had fled, and all they
told of was of a sweet, child-like insanity within. The watchers could
not touch her with their sympathy, or come near her in her dim world;--so,
mutely, but looking at each other from time to time with tearful eyes,
they took a poor comfort from the one evident fact that, though lost and
gone astray, she was happy and at peace. They had never heard her sing;
indeed, the simple art which her mother had taught her, had died, with
her early joyousness, at that dear mother's death. But now she sang continually,
very slow, and low. She went from one old childish ditty to another without
let or pause, keeping a strange sort of time with her pretty fingers, as
they closed and unclosed themselves upon the counterpane. She never looked
at any one with the slightest glimpse of memory or intelligence in her
face; no, not even Leonard.</DD>

<DD>
Her strength faded day by day; but she knew it not. Her sweet lips were
parted to sing, even after the breath and the power to do so had left her,
and her fingers fell idly on the bed. Two days she lingered thus--all but
gone from them, and yet still there.</DD>

<DD>
They stood around her bedside, not speaking, or sighing, or moaning; they
were too much awed by the exquisite peacefulness of her look for that.
Suddenly she opened wide her eyes, and gazed intently forwards, as if she
saw some happy vision, which called out a lovely, rapturous, breathless
smile. They held their very breaths.</DD>

<DD>
"I see the Light coming," said she. "The Light is coming," she said. And,
raising herself slowly, she stretched out her arms, and then fell back,
very still for evermore.</DD>

<DD>
They did not speak. Mr. Davis was the first to utter a word.</DD>

<DD>
"It is over!" said he. "She is dead!"</DD>

<DD>
Out rang through the room the cry of Leonard--</DD>

<DD>
"Mother! mother! mother! You have not left me alone! You will not leave
me alone! You are not dead! Mother! Mother!"</DD>

<DD>
They had pent in his agony of apprehension till then, that no wail of her
child might disturb her ineffable calm. But now there was a cry heard through
the house, of one refusing to be comforted: "Mother! Mother!"</DD>

<DD>
But Ruth lay dead.</DD>
