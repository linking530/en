<DD>
Sunday came, as brilliant as if there were no sorrow, or death, or guilt
in the world; a day or two of rain had made the earth fresh and brave as
the blue heavens above. Ruth thought it was too strong a realisation of
her hopes, and looked for an over-clouding at noon; but the glory endured,
and at two o'clock she was in the Leasowes, with a beating heart full of
joy, longing to stop the hours, which would pass too quickly through the
afternoon.</DD>

<DD>
They sauntered through the fragrant lanes, as if their loitering would
prolong the time and check the fiery-footed steeds galloping apace towards
the close of the happy day. It was past five o'clock before they came to
the great mill-wheel, which stood in Sabbath idleness, motionless in a
brown mass of shade, and still wet with yesterday's immersion in the deep
transparent water beneath. They clambered the little hill, not yet fully
shaded by the overarching elms; and then Ruth checked Mr. Bellingham, by
a slight motion of the hand which lay within his arm, and glanced up into
his face to see what that face should express as it looked on Milham Grange,
now lying still and peaceful in its afternoon shadows. It was a house of
after-thoughts; building materials were plentiful in the neighbourhood,
and every successive owner had found a necessity for some addition or projection,
till it was a picturesque mass of irregularity--of broken light and shadow--which,
as a whole, gave a full and complete idea of a "Home." All its gables and
nooks were blended and held together by the tender green of the climbing
roses and young creepers. An old couple were living in the house until
it should be let, but they dwelt in the back part, and never used the front
door; so the little birds had grown tame and familiar, and perched upon
the window-sills and porch, and on the old stone cistern which caught the
water from the roof.</DD>

<DD>
They went silently through the untrimmed garden, full of the pale-coloured
flowers of spring. A spider had spread her web over the front door. The
sight of this conveyed a sense of desolation to Ruth's heart; she thought
it was possible the state-entrance had never been used since her father's
dead body had been borne forth, and without speaking a word, she turned
abruptly away, and went round the house to another door. Mr. Bellingham
followed without questioning, little understanding her feelings, but full
of admiration for the varying expression called out upon her face.</DD>

<DD>
The old woman had not yet returned from church, or from the weekly gossip
or neighbourly tea which succeeded. The husband sat in the kitchen, spelling
the psalms for the day in his Prayer-book, and reading the words out aloud--a
habit he had acquired from the double solitude of his life, for he was
deaf. He did not hear the quiet entrance of the pair, and they were struck
with the sort of ghostly echo which seems to haunt half-furnished and uninhabited
houses. The verses he was reading were the following:--</DD>

<DD>
"Why art thou so vexed, O my soul: and why art thou so disquieted within
me?</DD>

<DD>
"O put thy trust in God: for I will yet thank him, which is the help of
my countenance, and my God."</DD>

<DD>
And when he had finished he shut the book, and sighed with the satisfaction
of having done his duty. The words of holy trust, though, perhaps, they
were not fully understood, carried a faithful peace down into the depths
of his soul. As he looked up, he saw the young couple standing in the middle
of the floor. He pushed his iron-rimmed spectacles. on to his forehead,
and rose to greet the daughter of his old master and ever-honoured mistress.</DD>

<DD>
"God bless thee, lass! God bless thee! My old eyes are glad to see thee
again."</DD>

<DD>
Ruth sprang forward to shake the horny hand stretched forward in the action
of blessing. She pressed it between both of hers, as she rapidly poured
out questions. Mr. Bellingham was not altogether comfortable at seeing
one whom he had already begun to appropriate as his own, so tenderly familiar
with a hard-featured, meanly-dressed day-labourer. He sauntered to the
window, and looked out into the grass-grown farmyard; but he could not
help overhearing some of the conversation, which seemed to him carried
on too much in the tone of equality. "And who's yon?" asked the old labourer
at last. "Is he your sweetheart? Your missis's son, I reckon. He's a spruce
young chap, anyhow."</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Bellingham's "blood of all the Howards" rose and tingled about his
ears, so that he could not hear Ruth's answer. It began by "Hush, Thomas;
pray hush!" but how it went on he did not catch. The idea of his being
Mrs. Mason's son! It was really too ridiculous; but, like most things which
are "too ridiculous," it made him very angry. He was hardly himself again
when Ruth shyly came to the window-recess and asked him if he would like
to see the house-place, into which the front-door entered; many people
thought it very pretty, she said, half-timidly, for his face had unconsciously
assumed a hard and haughty expression, which he could not instantly soften
down. He followed her, however; but before he left the kitchen he saw the
old man standing, looking at Ruth's companion with a strange, grave air
of dissatisfaction.</DD>

<DD>
They went along one or two zig-zag damp-smelling stone passages, and then
entered the house-place, or common sitting-room for a farmer's family in
that part of the country. The front door opened into it, and several other
apartments issued out of it, such as the dairy, the state bedroom (which
was half-parlour as well), and a small room which had been appropriated
to the late Mrs. Hilton, where she sat, or more frequently lay, commanding
through the open door the comings and goings of her household. In those
days the house-place had been a cheerful room, full of life, with the passing
to and fro of husband, child, and servants; with a great merry wood-fire
crackling and blazing away every evening, and hardly let out in the very
heat of summer; for with the thick stone walls, and the deep window-seats,
and the drapery of vine-leaves and ivy, that room, with its flag-floor,
seemed always to want the sparkle and cheery warmth of a fire. But now
the green shadows from without seemed to have become black in the uninhabited
desolation. The oaken shovel-board, the heavy dresser, and the carved cupboards,
were now dull and damp, which were formerly polished up to the brightness
of a looking-glass where the fire-blaze was for ever glinting; they only
added to. the oppressive gloom; the flag-floor was wet with heavy moisture.
Ruth stood gazing into the room, seeing nothing of what was present. She
saw a vision of former days--an evening in the days of her childhood; her
father sitting in the "master's corner" near the fire, sedately smoking
his pipe, while he dreamily watched his wife and child; her mother reading
to her, as she sat on a little stool at her feet. It was gone--all gone
into the land of shadows; but for the moment it seemed so present in the
old room, that Ruth believed her actual life to be the dream. Then, 'still
silent, she went on into her mother's parlour. But there, the bleak look
of what had once been full of peace and mother's love, struck cold on her
heart. She uttered a cry, and threw herself down by the sofa, hiding her
face in her hands, while her frame quivered with her repressed sobs.</DD>

<DD>
"Dearest Ruth, don't give way so. It can do no good; it cannot bring back
the dead," said Mr. Bellingham, distressed at witnessing her distress.</DD>

<DD>
"I know it cannot," murmured Ruth; "and that is why I cry. I cry because
nothing will ever bring them hack again." She sobbed afresh, but more gently,
for his kind words soothed her, and softened, if they could not take away,
her sense of desolation.</DD>

<DD>
"Come away; I cannot have you stay here, full of painful associations as
these rooms must be. Come"--raising her with gentle violence--"show me
your little garden you have often told me about. Near the window of this
very room, is it not? See how well I remember everything you tell me."</DD>

<DD>
He led her round through the back part of the house into the pretty old-fashioned
garden. There was a sunny border just under the windows, and clipped box
and yew-trees by the grass-plat, further away from the house; and she prattled
again of her childish adventures and solitary plays. When they turned round
they saw the old man, who had hobbled out with the help of his stick, and
was looking at them with the same grave, sad look of anxiety.</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Bellingham spoke rather sharply--</DD>

<DD>
"Why does that old man follow us about in that way? It is excessively impertinent
of him, I think."</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, don't call old Thomas impertinent. He is so good and kind, he is like
a father to me. I remember sitting on his knee many and many a time when
I was a child, whilst he told me stories out of the 'Pilgrim's Progress.'
He taught me to suck up milk through a straw. Mamma was very fond of him,
too. He used to sit with us always in the evenings when papa was away at
market, for mamma was rather afraid of having no man in the house, and
used to beg old Thomas to stay; and he would take me on his knee, and listen
just as attentively as I did while mamma read aloud."</DD>

<DD>
"You don't mean to say you have sat upon that old fellow's knee?"</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, yes! many and many a time."</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Bellingham looked graver than he had done while witnessing Ruth's passionate
emotion in her mother's room. But he lost his sense of indignity in admiration
of his companion as she wandered among the flowers, seeking for favourite
bushes or plants, to which some history or remembrance was attached. She
wound in and out in natural, graceful, wavy lines between the luxuriant
and overgrown shrubs, which were fragrant with a leafy smell of spring
growth; she went on, careless of watching eyes, indeed unconscious, for
the time, of their existence. Once she stopped to take hold of a spray
of jessamine, and softly kiss it; it had been her mother's favourite flower.</DD>

<DD>
Old Thomas was standing by the horse-mount, and was also an observer of
all her goings-on. But, while Mr. Bellingham's feeling was that of passionate
admiration mingled with a selfish kind of love, the old man gazed with
tender anxiety, and his lips moved in words of blessing--</DD>

<DD>
"She's a pretty creature, with a glint of her mother about her; and she's
the same kind lass as ever. Not a bit set up with yon fine manty-maker's
shop she's in. I misdoubt that young fellow though, for all she called
him a real gentleman, and checked me when I asked if he was her sweetheart.
If his are not sweetheart's looks, I've forgotten all my young days. Here!
they're going, I suppose. Look! he wants her to go without a word to the
old man; but she is none so changed as that, I reckon."</DD>

<DD>
Not Ruth, indeed! She never perceived the dissatisfied expression of Mr.
Bellingham's countenance, visible to the old man's keen eye; but came running
up to Thomas to send her love to his wife, and to shake him many times
by the hand.</DD>

<DD>
"Tell Mary I'll make her such a fine gown, as soon as ever I set up for
myself; it shall be all in the fashion, big gigot sleeves, that she shall
not know herself in them! Mind you tell her that, Thomas, will you?"</DD>

<DD>
"Ay, that I will, lass; and I reckon she'll be pleased to hear thou hast
not forgotten thy old merry ways. The Lord bless thee--the Lord lift up
the light of His countenance upon thee."</DD>

<DD>
Ruth was half-way towards the impatient Mr. Bellingham when her old friend
called her back. He longed to give her a warning of the danger that he
thought she was in, and yet he did not know how. When she came up, all
he could think of to say was a text; indeed, the language of the Bible
was the language in which he thought, whenever his ideas went beyond practical
everyday life into expressions of emotion or feeling. "My dear, remember
the devil goeth about as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour; remember
that, Ruth."</DD>

<DD>
The words fell on her ear, but gave no definite idea. The utmost they suggested
was the remembrance of the dread she felt as a child when this verse came
into her mind, and how she used to imagine a lion's head with glaring eyes
peering out of the bushes in a dark shady part of the wood, which, for
this reason, she had always avoided, and even now could hardly think of
without a shudder. She never imagined that the grim warning related to
the handsome young man who awaited her with a countenance beaming with
love, and tenderly drew her hand within his arm.</DD>

<DD>
The old man sighed as he watched them away. "The Lord may help her to guide
her steps aright. He may. But I'm afeard she's treading in perilous places.
I'll put my missis up to going to the town and getting speech of her, and
telling her a bit of her danger. An old motherly woman like our Mary will
set about it better nor a stupid fellow like me."</DD>

<DD>
The poor old labourer prayed long and earnestly that night for Ruth. He
called it "wrestling for her soul;" and I think that his prayers were heard,
for "God judgeth not as man judgeth."</DD>

<DD>
Ruth went on her way, all unconscious of the dark phantoms of the future
that were gathering around her; her melancholy turned, with the pliancy
of childish years, at sixteen not yet lost, into a softened manner which
was infinitely charming. By-and-by she cleared up into sunny happiness.
The evening was still and full of mellow light, and the new-born summer
was so delicious that, in common with all young creatures, she shared its
influence and was glad.</DD>

<DD>
They stood together at the top of a steep ascent, "the hill" of the hundred.
At the summit there was a level space, sixty or seventy yards square, of
unenclosed and broken ground, over which the golden bloom of the gorse
cast a rich hue, while its delicious scent perfumed the fresh and nimble
air. On one side of this common, the ground sloped down to a clear bright
pond, in which were mirrored the rough sand-cliffs that rose abrupt on
the opposite bank; hundreds of martens found a home there, and were now
wheeling over the transparent water, and dipping in their wings in their
evening sport. Indeed, all sorts of birds seemed to haunt the lonely pool;
the water-wagtails were scattered around its margin, the linnets perched
on the topmost sprays of the gorse-bushes, and other hidden warblers sang
their vespers on the uneven ground beyond. On the far side of the green
waste, close by the road, and well placed for the requirements of horses
or their riders who might be weary with the ascent of the hill, there was
a public-house, which was more of a farm than an inn. It was a long, low
building, rich in dormer-windows on the weather side, which were necessary
in such an exposed situation, and with odd projections and unlooked-for
gables on every side; there was a deep porch in front, on whose hospitable
benches a dozen persons might sit and enjoy the balmy air. A noble sycamore
grew right before the house, with seats all round it ("such tents the patriarchs
loved"); and a nondescript sign hung from a branch on the side next to
the road, which, being wisely furnished with an interpretation, was found
to mean King Charles in the oak.</DD>

<DD>
Near this comfortable, quiet, unfrequented inn, there was another pond,
for household and farmyard purposes, from which the cattle were drinking,
before returning to the fields after they had been milked. Their very motions
were so lazy and slow, that they served to fill up the mind with the sensation
of dreamy rest. Ruth and Mr. Bellingham plunged through the broken ground
to regain the road near the wayside inn. Hand-in-hand, now pricked by the
far-spreading gorse, now ankle-deep in sand; now pressing the soft, thick
heath, which should make so brave an autumn show; and now over wild thyme
and other fragrant herbs, they made their way, with many a merry laugh.
Once on the road, at the summit, Ruth stood silent, in breathless delight
at the view before her. The hill fell suddenly down into the plain, extending
for a dozen miles or more. There was a clump of dark Scotch firs close
to them, which cut clear against the western sky, and threw back the nearest
levels into distance. The plain below them was richly wooded, and was tinted
by the young tender hues of the earliest summer, for all the trees of the
wood had donned their leaves except the cautious ash, which here and there
gave a soft, pleasant greyness to the landscape. Far away in the champaign
were spires, and towers, and stacks of chimneys belonging to some distant
hidden farmhouse, which were traced downwards through the golden air by
the thin columns of blue smoke sent up from the evening fires. The view
was bounded by some rising ground in deep purple shadow against the sunset
sky.</DD>

<DD>
When first they stopped, silent with sighing pleasure, the air seemed full
of pleasant noises; distant church-bells made harmonious music with the
little singing-birds near at hand; nor were the lowings of the cattle nor
the calls of the farm-servants discordant, for the voices seemed to be
hushed by the brooding consciousness of the Sabbath. They stood loitering
before the house, quietly enjoying the view. The clock in the little inn
struck eight, and it sounded clear and sharp in the stillness.</DD>

<DD>
"Can it be so late?" asked Ruth.</DD>

<DD>
"I should not have thought it possible," answered Mr. Bellingham. "But,
never mind, you will be at home long before nine. Stay, there is a shorter
road, I know, through the fields; just wait a moment, while I go in and
ask the exact way." He dropped Ruth's arm, and went into the public-house.</DD>

<DD>
A gig had been slowly toiling up the sandy hill behind, unperceived by
the young couple, and now it reached the tableland, and was close upon
them as they separated. Ruth turned round, when the sound of the horse's
footsteps came distinctly as he reached the level. She faced Mrs. Mason!</DD>

<DD>
They were not ten--no, not five yards apart. At the same moment they recognised
each other, and, what was worse, Mrs. Mason had clearly seen, with her
sharp, needle-like eyes, the attitude in which Ruth had stood with the
young man who had just quitted her. Ruth's hand had been lying in his arm,
and fondly held there by his other hand.</DD>

<DD>
Mrs. Mason was careless about the circumstances of temptation into which
the girls entrusted to her as apprentices were thrown, but severely intolerant
if their conduct was in any degree influenced by the force of these temptations.
She called this intolerance "keeping up the character of her establishment."
It would have been a better and more Christian thing if she had kept up
the character of her girls by tender vigilance and maternal care.</DD>

<DD>
This evening, too, she was in an irritated state of temper. Her brother
had undertaken to drive her round by Henbury, in order to give her the
unpleasant information of the misbehaviour of her eldest son, who was an
assistant in a draper's shop in a neighbouring town. She was full of indignation
against want of steadiness, though not willing to direct her indignation
against the right object--her ne'er-do-well darling. While she was thus
charged with anger (for her brother justly defended her son's master and
companions from her attacks), she saw Ruth standing with a lover, far away
from home, at such a time in the evening, and she boiled over with intemperate
displeasure.</DD>

<DD>
"Come here directly, Miss Hilton," she exclaimed sharply. Then, dropping
her voice to low, bitter tones of concentrated wrath; she said to the trembling,
guilty Ruth--</DD>

<DD>
"Don't attempt to show your face at my house again after this conduct.
I saw you, and your spark too. I'll have no slurs on the character of my
apprentices. Don't say a word. I saw enough. I shall write and tell your
guardian to-morrow.</DD>

<DD>
The horse started away, for he was impatient to be off; and Ruth was left
standing there, stony, sick, and pale, as if the lightning had tom up the
ground beneath her feet. She could not go on standing, she was so sick
and faint; she staggered back to the broken sand-bank, and sank down, and
covered her face with her hands.</DD>

<DD>
"My dearest Ruth! are you ill? Speak, darling! My love, my love, do speak
to me!"</DD>

<DD>
What tender words after such harsh ones! They loosened the fountain of
Ruth's tears, and she cried bitterly.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh! did you see her--did you hear what she said?"</DD>

<DD>
"She! Who, my darling? Don't sob so, Ruth; tell me what it is. Who has
been near you?--who has been speaking to you to make you cry so?"</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, Mrs. Mason." And there was a fresh burst of sorrow.</DD>

<DD>
"You don't say so! are you sure? I was not away five minutes."</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, yes, sir, I'm quite sure. She was so angry; she said I must never
show my face there again. Oh, dear! what shall I do?"</DD>

<DD>
It seemed to the poor child as if Mrs. Mason's words were irrevocable,
and, that being so, she was shut out from every house. She saw how much
she had done that was deserving of blame, now when it was too late to undo
it. She knew with what severity and taunts Mrs. Mason had often treated
her for involuntary fallings, of which she had been quite unconscious;
and now she had really done wrong, and shrank with terror from the consequences.
Her eyes were so blinded by the fast-falling tears, she did not see (nor,
had she seen, would she have been able to interpret) the change in Mr.
Bellingham's countenance, as he stood silently watching her. He was silent
so long, that even in her sorrow she began to wonder that he did not speak,
and to wish to hear his soothing words once more.</DD>

<DD>
"It is very unfortunate," he began, at last; and then he stopped; then
he began again: "It is very unfortunate; for, you see, I did not like to
name it to you before, but, I believe--I have business, in fact, which
obliges me to go to town to-morrow--to London, I mean; and I don't know
when I shall be able to return."</DD>

<DD>
"To London!" cried Ruth; "are you going away? Oh, Mr. Bellingham!" She
wept afresh, giving herself up to the desolate feeling of sorrow, which
absorbed all the terror she had been experiencing at the idea of Mrs. Mason's
anger. It seemed to her at this moment as though she could have borne everything
but his departure; but she did not speak again; and, after two or three
minutes had elapsed, he spoke--not in his natural careless voice, but in
a sort of constrained, agitated tone.</DD>

<DD>
"I can hardly bear the idea of leaving you, my own Ruth. In such distress,
too; for where you can go I do not know at all. From all you have told
me of Mrs. Mason, I don't think she is likely to mitigate her severity
in your case.</DD>

<DD>
No answer, but tears quietly, incessantly flowing. Mrs. Mason's displeasure
seemed a distant thing; his going away was the present distress. He went
on--</DD>

<DD>
"Ruth, would you go with me to London? My darling, I cannot leave you here
without a home; the thought of leaving you at all is pain enough, but in
these circumstances--so friendless, so homeless--it is impossible. You
mustcome with me, love, and trust to me."</DD>

<DD>
Still she did not speak. Remember how young, and innocent, and motherless
she was! It seemed to her as if it would be happiness enough to be with
him; and as for the future, he would arrange and decide for that. The future
lay wrapped in a golden mist, which she did not care to penetrate; but
if he, her sun, was out of sight and gone, the golden mist became dark
heavy gloom, through which no hope could come. He took her hand.</DD>

<DD>
"Will you not come with me? Do you not love me enough to trust me? Oh,
Ruth (reproachfully), can you not trust me?"</DD>

<DD>
She had stopped crying, but was sobbing sadly.</DD>

<DD>
"I cannot bear this, love. Your sorrow is absolute pain to me; but it is
worse to feel how indifferent you are--how little you care about our separation."</DD>

<DD>
He dropped her hand. She burst into a fresh fit of crying.</DD>

<DD>
"I may have to join my mother in Paris; I don't know when I shall see you
again. Oh, Ruth!" said he vehemently, "do you love me at all?"</DD>

<DD>
She said something in a very low voice; he could not hear it, though he
bent down his head--but he took her hand again.</DD>

<DD>
"What was it you said, love? Was it not that you did love me? My darling,
you do! I can tell it by the trembling of this little hand; then you will
not suffer me to go away alone and unhappy, most anxious about you? There
is no other course open to you; my poor girl has no friends to receive
her. I will go home directly, and return in an hour with a carriage. You
make me too happy by your silence, Ruth."</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, what can I do?" exclaimed Ruth. "Mr. Bellingham, you should help me,
and instead of that you only bewilder me."</DD>

<DD>
"How, my dearest Ruth? Bewilder you! It seems so clear to me. Look at the
case fairly! Here you are, an orphan, with only one person to love you,
poor child!--thrown off, for no fault of yours, by the only creature on
whom you have a claim, that creature a tyrannical, inflexible woman; what
is more natural (and, being natural, more right) than that you should throw
yourself upon the care of the one who loves you dearly--who would go through
fire and water for you--who would shelter you from all harm? Unless, indeed,
as I suspect, you do not care for him. If so, Ruth, if you do not care
for me, we had better part--I will leave you at once; it will be better
for me to go, if you do not care for me.</DD>

<DD>
He said this very sadly (it seemed so to Ruth, at least), and made as though
he would have drawn his hand from hers; but now she held it with soft force.</DD>

<DD>
"Don't leave me, please, sir. It is very true I have no friend but you.
Don't leave me, please. But, oh! do tell me what I must do!"</DD>

<DD>
"Will you do it if I tell you? If you will trust me, I will do my very
best for you. I will give you my best advice. You see your position Mrs.
Mason writes and gives her own exaggerated account to your guardian; he
is bound by no great love to you, from what I have heard you say, and throws
you off; I, who might be able to befriend you--through my mother, perhaps--I,
who could at least comfort you a little (could not I, Ruth?), am away,
far away, for an indefinite time; that is your position at present. Now,
what I advise is this. Come with me into this little inn; I will order
tea for you--(I am sure you require it sadly)--and I will leave you there,
and go home for the carriage. I will return in an hour at the latest. Then
we are together, come what may; that is enough for me; is it not for you,
Ruth? Say yes--say it ever so low, but give me the delight of hearing it.
Ruth, say yes."</DD>

<DD>
Low and soft, with much hesitation, came the "Yes;" the fatal word of which
she so little imagined the infinite consequences. The thought of being
with him was all and everything.</DD>

<DD>
"How you tremble, my darling! You are cold, love! Come into the house,
and I'll order tea, directly, and be off."</DD>

<DD>
She rose, and, leaning on his arm, went into the house. She was shaking
and dizzy with the agitation of the last hour. He spoke to the civil farmer-landlord,
who conducted them into a neat parlour, with windows opening into the garden
at the back of the house. They had admitted much of the evening's fragrance
through their open casements before they were hastily closed by the attentive

"Tea, directly, for this lady!" The landlord vanished.</DD>

<DD>
"Dearest Ruth, I must go; there is not an instant to be lost. Promise me
to take some tea, for you are shivering all over, and deadly pale with
the fright that abominable woman has given you. I must go; I shall be back
in half an hour--and then no more partings, darling.</DD>

<DD>
He kissed her pale cold face, and went away. The room whirled round before
Ruth; it was a dream--a strange, varying, shifting dream--with the old
home of her childhood for one scene, with the terror of Mrs. Mason's unexpected
appearance for another; and then, strangest, dizziest, happiest of all,
there was the consciousness of his love, who was all the world to her,
and the remembrance of the tender words, which still kept up their low
soft echo in her heart.</DD>

<DD>
Her head ached so much that she could hardly see; even the dusky twilight
was a dazzling glare to her poor eyes; and when the daughter of the house
brought in the sharp light of the candles, preparatory for tea, Ruth hid
her face in the sofa pillows with a low exclamation of pain.</DD>

<DD>
"Does your head ache, miss?" asked the girl, in a gentle, sympathising
voice. "Let me make you some tea, miss, it will do you good. Many's the
time poor mother's headaches were cured by good strong tea."</DD>

<DD>
Ruth murmured acquiescence; the young girl (about Ruth's own age, but who
was the mistress of the little establishment owing to her mother's death)
made tea, and brought Ruth a cup to the sofa where she lay. Ruth was feverish
and thirsty, and eagerly drank it off, although she could not touch the
bread and butter which the girl offered her. She felt better and fresher,
though she was still faint and weak.</DD>

<DD>
"Thank you," said Ruth. "Don't let me keep you, perhaps you are busy. You
have been very kind, and the tea has done me a great deal of good."</DD>

<DD>
The girl left the room. Ruth became as hot as she had previously been cold,
and went and opened the window, and leant out into the still, sweet, evening
air, The bush of sweet-brier underneath the window scented the place, and
the delicious fragrance reminded her of her old home. I think scents affect
and quicken the memory more than either sights or sound; for Ruth had instantly
before her eyes the little garden beneath the window of her mother's room
with the old man leaning on his stick watching her, just as he had done
not three hours before on that very afternoon.</DD>

<DD>
"Dear old Thomas! he and Mary would take me in, I think; they would love
me all the more if I were cast off. And Mr. Bellingham would, perhaps,
not be so very long away; and he would know where to find me if I stayed
at Milham Grange. Oh, would it not be better to go to them? I wonder if
he would be very sorry! I could not bear to make him sorry, so kind as
he has been to me; but I do believe it would be better to go to them, and
ask their advice, at any rate. He would follow me there; and I could talk
over what I had better do, with the three best friends I have in the world--the
only friends I have.</DD>

<DD>
She put on her bonnet, and opened the parlour-door; but then she saw the
square figure of the landlord standing at the open house-door, smoking
his evening pipe, and looming large and distinct against the dark air and
landscape beyond. Ruth remembered the cup of tea she had drunk; it must
be paid for, and she had no money with her. She feared that he would not
let her quit the house without paying. She thought that she would leave
a note for Mr. Bellingham, saying where she was gone, and how she had left
the house in debt, for (like a child) all dilemmas appeared of equal magnitude
to her; and the difficulty of passing the landlord while he stood there,
and of giving him an explanation of the circumstances (as far as such explanation
was due to him), appeared insuperable, and as awkward and fraught with
inconvenience as far more serious situations. She kept peeping out of her
room, after she had written her little pencil-note, to see if the outer
door was still obstructed. There he stood, motionless, enjoying his pipe,
and looking out into the darkness which gathered thick with the coming
night. The fumes of the tobacco were carried by the air into the house,
and brought back Ruth's sick headache. Her energy left her; she became
stupid and languid, and incapable of spirited exertion; she modified her
plan of action, to the determination of asking Mr. Bellingham to take her
to Milham Grange, to the care of her humble friends, instead of to London.
And she thought, in her simplicity, that he would instantly consent when
he had heard her reasons.</DD>

<DD>
She started up. A carriage dashed up to the door. She hushed her beating
heart, and tried to stop her throbbing head, to listen. She heard him speaking
to the landlord, though she could not distinguish what he said heard the
jingling of money, and in another moment he was in the room, and had taken
her arm to lead her to the carriage.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, sir, I want you to take me to Milham Grange," said she, holding back;
"old Thomas would give me a home."</DD>

<DD>
"Well, dearest, we'll talk of all that in the carriage; I am sure you will
listen to reason. Nay, if you will go to Milham, you must go in the carriage,"
said he hurriedly. She was little accustomed to oppose the wishes of any
one; obedient and docile by nature, and unsuspicious and innocent of any
harmful consequences. She entered the carriage, and drove towards London.</DD>
