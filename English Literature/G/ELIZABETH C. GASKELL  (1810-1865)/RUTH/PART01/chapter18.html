One afternoon, not long after this, Mr. and Miss Benson set off to call
upon a farmer, who attended the chapel, but lived at some distance from
the town. They intended to stay to tea if they were invited, and Ruth and
Sally were left to spend a long afternoon together. At first, Sally was
busy in her kitchen, and Ruth employed herself in carrying her baby out
into the garden. It was now nearly a year since she came to the Bensons';
it seemed like yesterday, and yet as if a lifetime had gone between. The
flowers were budding now, that were all in bloom when she came down, on
the first autumnal morning, into the sunny parlour. The yellow jessamine
that was then a tender plant, had now taken firm root in the soil, and
was sending out strong shoots; the wall-flowers, which Miss Benson had
sown on the wall a day or two after her arrival, were scenting the air
with their fragrant flowers. Ruth knew every plant now; it seemed as though
she had always lived here, and always known the inhabitants of the house.
She heard Sally singing her accustomed song in the kitchen, a song she
never varied, over her afternoon's work. It began--</DD>

<DD>
"As I was going to Derby, sir,</DD>

<DD>
Upon a market-day."</DD>

<DD>
And, if music is a necessary element in a song, perhaps I had better call
it by some other name.</DD>

<DD>
But the strange change was in Ruth herself. She was conscious of it, though
she could not define it, and did not dwell upon it. Life had become significant
and full of duty to her. She delighted in the exercise of her intellectual
powers, and liked the idea of the infinite amount of which she was ignorant;
for it was a grand pleasure to learn,--to crave, and be satisfied. She
strove to forget what had gone before this last twelve months. She shuddered
up from contemplating it; it was like a bad, unholy dream. And yet, there
was a strange yearning kind of love for the father of the child whom she
pressed to her heart, which came, and she could not bid it begone as sinful,
it was so pure and natural, even when thinking of it as in the sight of
God. Little Leonard cooed to the flowers, and stretched after their bright
colours; and Ruth laid him on the dry turf, and pelted him with the gay
petals. He chinked and crowed with laughing delight, and clutched at her
cap, and pulled it off. Her short rich curls were golden-brown in the slanting
sun-light, and by their very shortness made her more childlike. She hardly
seemed as if she could be the mother of the noble babe over whom she knelt,
now snatching kisses, now matching his cheek with rose-leaves. All at once,
the bells of the old church struck the hour, and far away, high up in the
air, began slowly to play the old tune of "Life, let us cherish;" they
had played it for years--for the life of man--and it always sounded fresh,
and strange, and aerial. Ruth was still in a moment, she knew not why;
and the tears came into her eyes as she listened. When it was ended, she
kissed her baby, and bade God bless him.</DD>

<DD>
Just then Sally came out, dressed for the evening, with a leisurely look
about her. She had done her work, and she and Ruth were to drink tea together
in the exquisitely clean kitchen; but while the kettle was boiling, she
came out to enjoy the flowers. She gathered a piece of southern-wood, and
stuffed it up her nose, by way of smelling it.</DD>

<DD>
"Whatten you call this in your country?" asked she.</DD>

<DD>
"Old-man," replied Ruth.</DD>

<DD>
"We call it here lad's-love. It and peppermint drops always reminds me
of going to church in the country. Here! I'll get you a black-currant leaf
to put in the teapot. It gives it a flavour. We had bees once against this
wall; but when missus died, we forgot to tell 'em and put 'em in mourning,
and, in course, they swarmed away without our knowing, and the next winter
came a hard frost, and they died. Now, I dare say, the water will be boiling;
and it's time for little master there to come in, for the dew is falling.
See, all the daisies is shutting themselves up."</DD>

<DD>
Sally was most gracious as a hostess. She quite put on her company manners
to receive Ruth in the kitchen. They laid Leonard to sleep on the sofa
in the parlour, that they might hear him the more easily, and then they
sat quietly down to their sewing by the bright kitchen fire. Sally was,
as usual, the talker; and, as usual, the subject was the family of whom
for so many years she had formed a part.</DD>

<DD>
"Ay! things was different when I was a girl," quoth she. "Eggs was thirty
for a shilling, and butter only sixpence a pound. My wage when I came here
was but three pound, and I did on it, and was always clean and tidy, which
is more than many a lass can say now who gets seven and eight pound a year;
and tea was kept for an afternoon drink, and pudding was eaten afore meat
in them days, and the upshot was, people paid their debts better; ay, ay!
we'n gone backwards, and we thinken we'n gone forrards."</DD>

<DD>
After shaking her head a little over the degeneracy of the times, Sally
returned to a part of the subject on which she thought she had given Ruth
a wrong idea.</DD>

<DD>
"You'll not go for to think now that I've not more than three pound a year.
I've a deal above that now. First of all, old missus gave me four pound,
for she said I were worth it, and I thought in my heart that I were; so
I took it without more ado; but after her death, Master Thurstan and Miss
Faith took a fit of spending, and says they to me, one day as I carried
tea in, 'Sally, we think your wages ought to be raised.' 'What matter what
you think!' said I, pretty sharp, for I thought they'd ha' shown more respect
to missus, if they'd let things stand as they were in her time; and they'd
gone and moved the sofa away from the wall to where it stands now, already
that very day. So I speaks up sharp, and says I, 'As long as I'm content,
I think it's no business of yours to be meddling wi' me and my money matters.'
'But,' says Miss Faith (she's always the one to speak first if you'll notice,
though it's master that comes in and clinches the matter with some reason
she'd never ha' thought of--he were always a sensible lad), 'Sally, all
the servants in the town have six pound and better, and you have as hard
a place as any of 'em.' 'Did you ever hear me grumble about my work that
you talk about it in that way? wait till I grumble,' says I, 'but don't
meddle wi' me till then.' So I flung off in a huff; but in the course of
the evening, Master Thurstan came in and sat down in the kitchen, and he's
such winning ways he wiles one over to anything; and besides, a notion
had come into my head--now you'll not tell," said she, glancing round the
room, and hitching her chair nearer to Ruth in a confidential manner; Ruth
promised, and Sally went on--</DD>

<DD>
"I thought I should like to be an heiress wi' money, and leave it all to
Master and Miss Faith; and I thought if I'd six pound a year, I could,
may be, get to be an heiress; all I was feared on was that some chap or
other might marry me for my money, but I've managed to keep the fellows
off; so I looks mim and grateful, and I thanks Master Thurstan for his
offer, and I takes the wages; and what do you think I've done?" asked Sally,
with an exultant air.</DD>

<DD>
"What have you done?" asked Ruth.</DD>

<DD>
"Why," replied Sally, slowly and emphatically, "I've saved thirty pound!
but that's not it. I've getten a lawyer to make me a will; that's it, wench!"
said she, slapping Ruth on the back.</DD>

<DD>
"How did you manage it?" asked Ruth.</DD>

<DD>
"Ay, that was it," said Sally; "I thowt about it many a night before I
hit on the right way. I was afeared the money might be thrown into Chancery
if I didn't make it all safe, and yet I could na' ask Master Thurstan.
At last, and at length, John Jackson, the grocer, had a nephew come to
stay a week with him, as was 'prentice to a lawyer in Liverpool; so now
was my time, and here was my lawyer. Wait a minute! I could tell you my
story better if I had my will in my hand; and I'll scomfish you if ever
you go for to tell."</DD>

<DD>
She held up her hand, and threatened Ruth as she left the kitchen to fetch
the will.</DD>

<DD>
When she came back, she brought a parcel tied up, in a blue pocket-handkerchief;
she sat down, squared her knees, untied the handkerchief, and displayed
a small piece of parchment.</DD>

<DD>
"Now, do you know what this is?" said she, holding it up. "It's parchment,
and it's the right stuff to make wills on. People gets into Chancery if
they don't make them o' this stuff, and I reckon Tom Jackson thowt he'd
have a fresh job on it if he could get it into Chancery; for the rascal
went and wrote it on a piece of paper at first, and came and read it me
out aloud off a piece of paper no better than what one writes letters upon.
I were up to him; and, thinks I, Come, come, my lad, I'm not a fool, though
you may think so; I know a paper will won't stand, but I'll let you run
your rig. So I sits and I listens. And would you believe me, he read it
out as if it were as clear a business as your giving me that thimble--no
more ado, though it were thirty pound I could understand it mysel'--that
were no law for me. I wanted summat to consider about, and for th' meaning
to be wrapped up as I wrap up my best gown. So, says I, 'Tom! it's not
on parchment. I mun have it on parchment.' 'This 'll do as well,' says
he. 'We'll get it witnessed, and it will stand good.' Well! I liked the
notion of having it witnessed, and for a while that soothed me; but after
a bit, I felt I should like it done according to law, and not plain out
as anybody might ha' done it; I mysel', if I could have written. So says
I, 'Tom! I mun have it on parchment.' 'Parchment costs money,' says he,
very grave. 'Oh, oh, my lad! are ye there?' thinks I. 'That's the reason
I'm clipped of law. So says I, 'Tom! I mun have it on parchment. I'll pay
the money and welcome. It's thirty pound, and what I can lay to it. I'll
make it safe. It shall be on parchment, and I'll tell thee what, lad! I'll
gie ye sixpence for every good law-word you put in it, sounding like, and
not to be caught up as a person runs. Your master had need to be ashamed
of you as a 'prentice, if you can't do a thing more tradesman-like than
this!' Well! he laughed above a bit, but I were firm, and stood to it.
So he made it out on parchment. Now, woman, try and read it!" said she,
giving it to Ruth.</DD>

<DD>
Ruth smiled, and began to read; Sally listening with rapt attention. When
Ruth came to the word "testatrix," Sally stopped her.</DD>

<DD>
"That was the first sixpence," said she. "I thowt he was going to fob me
off again wi' plain language; but when that word came, I out wi' my sixpence,
and gave it to him on the spot. Now, go on."</DD>

<DD>
Presently Ruth read "accruing."</DD>

<DD>
"That was the second sixpence. Four sixpences it were in all, besides six-and-eightpence
as we bargained at first, and three-and-fourpence parchment. There! that's
what I call a will; witnessed, according to law, and all. Master Thurstan
will be prettily taken in when I die, and he finds all his extra wage left
back to him. But it will teach him it's not so easy as he thinks for, to
make a woman give up her way.</DD>

<DD>
The time was now drawing near when little Leonard might be weaned--the
time appointed by all three for Ruth to endeavour to support herself in
some way more or less independent of Mr. and Miss Benson. This prospect
dwelt much in all of their minds, and was in each shaded with some degree
of perplexity; but they none of them spoke of it, for fear of accelerating
the event. If they had felt clear and determined as to the best course
to be pursued, they were none of them deficient in courage to commence
upon that course at once. Miss Benson would, perhaps, have objected the
most to any alteration in their present daily mode of life; but that was
because she had the habit of speaking out her thoughts as they arose, and
she particularly disliked and dreaded change. Besides this, she had felt
her heart open out, and warm towards the little helpless child, in a strong
and powerful manner. Nature had intended her warm instincts to find vent
in a mother's duties; her heart had yearned after children, and made her
restless in her childless state, without her well knowing why; but now,
the delight she experienced in tending, nursing, and contriving for the
little boy,--even contriving to the point of sacrificing many of her cherished
whims,--made her happy, and satisfied, and peaceful. It was more difficult
to sacrifice her whims than her comforts; but all had been given up when
and where required by the sweet lordly baby, who reigned paramount in his
very helplessness.</DD>

<DD>
From some cause or other, an exchange of ministers for one Sunday was to
be effected with a neighbouring congregation, and Mr. Benson went on a
short absence from home. When he returned on Monday, he was met at the
house-door by his sister, who had evidently been looking out for him for
some time. She stepped out to greet him.</DD>

<DD>
"Don't hurry yourself, Thurstan! all's well; only I wanted to tell you
something. Don't fidget yourself--baby is quite well, bless him! It's only
good news. Come into your room, and let me talk a little quietly with you."</DD>

<DD>
She drew him into his study, which was near the outer door, and then she
took off his coat, and put his carpet-bag in a corner, and wheeled a chair
to the fire, before she would begin.</DD>

<DD>
"Well, now! to think how often things fall out just as we want them, Thurstan!
Have not you often wondered what was to be done with Ruth when the time
came at which we promised her she should earn her living? I am sure you
have, because I have so often thought about it myself. And yet I never
dared to speak out my fear because that seemed giving it a shape. And now
Mr. Bradshaw has put all to rights. He invited Mr. Jackson to dinner yesterday,
just as we were going into chapel; and then he turned to me and asked me
if I would come to tea-- straight from afternoon chapel, because Mrs. Bradshaw
wanted to speak to me. He made it very clear I was not to bring Ruth; and,
indeed, she was only too happy to stay at home with baby. And so I went;
and Mrs. Bradshaw took me into her bedroom, and shut the doors, and said
Mr. Bradshaw had told her, that he did not like Jemima being so much confined
with the younger ones while they were at their lessons, and that he wanted
some one above a nurse-maid to sit with them while their masters were there--some
one who would see about their learning their lessons, and who would walk
out with them; a sort of nursery governess, I think she meant, though she
did not say so; and Mr. Bradshaw (for, of course, I saw his thoughts and
words constantly peeping out, though he had told her to speak to me) believed
that our Ruth would be the very person. Now, Thurstan, don't look so surprised,
as if she had never come into your head! I am sure I saw what Mrs. Bradshaw
was driving at, long before she came to the point; and I could scarcely
keep from smiling, and saying, 'We'd jump at the proposal'--long before
I ought to have known anything about it."</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, I wonder what we ought to do!" said Mr. Benson. "Or, rather, I believe
I see what we ought to do, if I durst but do it."</DD>

<DD>
"Why, what ought we to do?" asked his sister, in surprise.</DD>

<DD>
"I ought to go and tell Mr. Bradshaw the whole story----"</DD>

<DD>
"And get Ruth turned out of our house," said Miss Benson indignantly.</DD>

<DD>
"They can't make us do that," said her brother. "I do not think they would
try."</DD>

<DD>
"Yes, Mr. Bradshaw would try; and he would blazon out poor Ruth's sin,
and there would not be a chance for her left. I know him well, Thurstan;
and why should he be told now, more than a year ago?"</DD>

<DD>
"A year ago he did not want to put her in a situation of trust about his
children."</DD>

<DD>
"And you think she'll abuse that trust, do you? You've lived a twelvemonth
in the house with Ruth, and the end of it is, you think she will do his
children harm! Besides, who encouraged Jemima to come to the house so much
to see Ruth? Did you not say it would do them both good to see something
of each other?"</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Benson sat thinking.</DD>

<DD>
"If you had not known Ruth as well as you do--if, during her stay with
us, you had marked anything wrong, or forward, or deceitful, or immodest,
I would say at once, Don't allow Mr. Bradshaw to take her into his house;
but still I would say, Don't tell of her sin and sorrow to so severe a
man--so unpitiful a judge. But here I ask you, Thurstan, can you or I,
or Sally (quick-eyed as she is), say, that in any one thing we have had
true, just occasion to find fault with Ruth? I don't mean that she is perfect--she
acts without thinking, her temper is sometimes warm and hasty; but have
we any right to go and injure her prospects for life, by telling Mr. Bradshaw
all we know of her errors--only sixteen when she did so wrong, and never
to escape from it all her many years to come--to have the despair which
would arise from its being known, clutching her back into worse sin? What
harm do you think she can do? What is the risk to which you think you are
exposing Mr. Bradshaw's children?" She paused, out of breath, her eyes
glittering with tears of indignation, and impatient for an answer that
she might knock it to pieces.</DD>

<DD>
"I do not see any danger that can arise," said he at length, and with slow
difficulty, as if not fully convinced. "I have watched Ruth, and I believe
she is pure and truthful; and the very sorrow and penitence she has felt--the
very suffering she has gone through--has given her a thoughtful conscientiousness
beyond her age."</DD>

<DD>
"That and the care of her baby," said Miss Benson, secretly delighted at
the tone of her brother's thoughts.</DD>

<DD>
"Ah, Faith! that baby you so much dreaded once, is turning out a blessing,
you see," said Thurstan, with a faint, quiet smile.</DD>

<DD>
"Yes! any one might be thankful, and better too, for Leonard; but how could
I tell that it would be like him?"</DD>

<DD>
"But to return to Ruth and Mr. Bradshaw. What did you say?"</DD>

<DD>
"Oh! with my feelings, of course, I was only too glad to accept the proposal,
and so I told Mrs. Bradshaw, then; and I afterwards repeated it to Mr.
Bradshaw, when he asked me if his wife had mentioned their plans. They
would understand that I must consult you and Ruth, before it could be considered
as finally settled."</DD>

<DD>
"And have you named it to her?"</DD>

<DD>
"Yes," answered Miss Benson, half afraid lest he should think she had been
too precipitate.</DD>

<DD>
"And what did she say?" asked he, after a little pause of grave silence.</DD>

<DD>
"At first she seemed very glad, and fell into my mood of planning how it
should all be managed; how Sally and I should take care of the baby the
hours that she was away at Mr. Bradshaw's; but by-and-by she became silent
and thoughtful, and knelt down by me and hid her face in my lap, and shook
a little as if she was crying; and then I heard her speak in a very low
smothered voice, for her head was still bent down--quite hanging down,
indeed, so that I could not see her face, so I stooped to listen, and I
heard her say, 'Do you think I should be good enough to teach little girls,
Miss Benson?' She said it so humbly and fearfully that all I thought of
was how to cheer her, and I answered and asked her if she did not hope
to be good enough to bring up her own darling to be a brave Christian man?
And she lifted up her head, and I saw her eyes looking wild and wet and
earnest, and she said, 'With God's help, that will I try to make my child.'
And I said then, 'Ruth, as you strive and as you pray for your own child,
so you must strive and pray to make Mary and Elizabeth good, if you are
trusted with them.' And she said out quite clear, though her face was hidden
from me once more, 'I will strive and I will pray.' You would not have
had any fears, Thurstan, if you could have heard and seen her last night."</DD>

<DD>
"I have no fear," said he decidedly. "Let the plan go on." After a minute,
he added, "But I am glad it was so far arranged before I heard of it. My
indecision about right and wrong--my perplexity as to how far we are to
calculate consequences--grows upon me, I fear."</DD>

<DD>
"You look tired and weary, dear. You should blame your body rather than
your conscience at these times."</DD>

<DD>
"A very dangerous doctrine."</DD>

<DD>
The scroll of Fate was closed, and they could not foresee the Future; and
yet, if they could have seen it, though they might have shrunk fearfully
at first, they would have smiled and thanked God when all was done and
said.</DD>
