The June of 18-- had been glorious and sunny, and full of flowers; but
July came in with pouring rain, and it was a gloomy time for travellers
and for weather-bound tourists, who lounged away the days in touching up
sketches, dressing flies, and reading over again, for the twentieth time,
the few volumes they had brought with them. A number of the <I>Times</I>,
five days old, had been in constant demand in all the sitting-rooms of
a certain inn in a little mountain village of North Wales, through a long
July morning. The valleys around were filled with thick, cold mist, which
had crept up the hillsides till the hamlet itself was folded in its white,
dense curtain, and from the inn-windows nothing was seen of the beautiful
scenery around. The tourists who thronged the rooms might as well have
been "wi' their dear little bairnies at hame;" and so some of them seemed
to think, as they stood, with their faces flattened against the windowpanes,
looking abroad in search of an event to fill up the dreary time. How many
dinners were hastened that day, by way of getting through the morning,
let the poor Welsh kitchen-maid say! The very village children kept indoors;
or, if one or two more adventurous stole out into the land of temptation
and puddles, they were soon clutched back by angry and busy mothers.</DD>

<DD>
It was only four o'clock, but most of the inmates of the inn thought it
must be between six and seven, the morning had seemed so long--so many
hours had passed since dinner--when a Welsh car, drawn by two horses, rattled
briskly up to the door. Every window of the ark was crowded with faces
at the sound; the leathern curtains were undrawn to their curious eyes,
and out sprang a gentleman, who carefully assisted a well-cloaked-up lady
into the little inn, despite the landlady's assurances of not having a
room to spare.</DD>

<DD>
The gentleman (it was Mr. Bellingham) paid no attention to the speeches
of the hostess, but quietly superintended the unpacking of the carriage,
and paid the postillion; then, turning round, with his face to the light,
he spoke to the landlady, whose voice had been rising during the last five
minutes--</DD>

<DD>
"Nay, Jenny, you're strangely altered, if you can turn out an old friend
on such an evening as this. If I remember right, Pen tre Voelas is twenty
miles across the bleakest mountain-road I ever saw."</DD>

<DD>
"Indeed, sir, and I did not know you; Mr. Bellingham, I believe. Indeed,
sir, Pen tre Voelas is not above eighteen miles--we only charge for eighteen;
it may not be much above seventeen,--and we're quite full, indeed, more's
the pity."</DD>

<DD>
"Well, but, Jenny, to oblige me, an old friend, you can find lodgings out
for some of your people--that house across, for instance."</DD>

<DD>
"Indeed, sir, and it's at liberty; perhaps you would not mind lodging there
yourself. I could get you the best rooms, and send over a trifle or so
of furniture, if they weren't as you'd wish them to be."</DD>

<DD>
"No, Jenny, here I stay. You'll not induce me to venture over into those
rooms, whose dirt I know of old. Can't you persuade some one who is not
an old friend to move across? Say, if you like, that I had written beforehand
to bespeak the rooms. Oh, I know you can manage it--I know your good-natured
ways."</DD>

<DD>
"Indeed, sir! Well, I'll see, if you and the lady will just step into the
back-parlour, sir--there's no one there just now; the lady is keeping her
bed to-day for a cold, and the gentleman is having a rubber at whist in
number three. I'll see what I can do."</DD>

<DD>
"Thank you--thank you! Is there a fire? if not, one must be lighted. Come,
Ruthie, come!"</DD>

<DD>
He led the way into a large bow-windowed room, which looked gloomy enough
that afternoon, but which I have seen bright and buoyant with youth and
hope within, and sunny lights creeping down the purple mountain slope,
and stealing over the green, soft meadows, till they reached the little
garden, full of roses and lavender-bushes, lying close under the window.
I have seen--but I shall see no more.</DD>

<DD>
"I did not know you had been here before," said Ruth, as Mr. Bellingham
helped her off with her cloak.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, yes; three years ago I was here on a reading party. We were here above
two months, attracted by Jenny's kind heart and oddities, but driven away
finally by the insufferable dirt. However, for a week or two it won't much
signify."</DD>

<DD>
"But can she take us in? I thought I heard her saying her house was full."</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, yes, I dare say it is; but I shall pay her well. She can easily make
excuses to some poor devil, and send him over to the other side; and for
a day or two, so that we have shelter, it does not much signify."</DD>

<DD>
"Could not we go to the house on the other side?"</DD>

<DD>
"And have our meals carried across to us in a half-warm state, to say nothing
of having no one to scold for bad cooking! You don't know these out-of-the-way
Welsh inns yet, Ruthie."</DD>

<DD>
"No, I only thought it seemed rather unfair," said Ruth gently; but she
did not end her sentence, for Mr. Bellingham formed his lips into a whistle,
and walked to the window to survey the rain.</DD>

<DD>
The remembrance of his former good payment prompted many little lies of
which Mrs. Morgan was guilty that afternoon, before she succeeded in turning
out a gentleman and lady, who were only planning to remain till the ensuing
Saturday at the outside; so, if they did fulfil their threat, and leave
on the next day, she would be no very great loser.</DD>

<DD>
These household arrangements complete, she solaced herself with tea in
her own little parlour, and shrewdly reviewed the circumstances of Mr.
Bellingham's arrival.</DD>

<DD>
"Indeed! and she's not his wife," thought Jenny, that's clear as day. His
wife would have brought her maid, and given herself twice as many airs
about the sitting-rooms; while this poor miss never spoke, but kept as
still as a mouse. Indeed, and young men will be young men; and as long
as their fathers and mothers shut their eyes, it's none of my business
to go about asking questions."</DD>

<DD>
In this manner they settled down to a week's enjoyment of that Alpine country.
It was most true enjoyment to Ruth. It was opening a new sense; vast ideas
of beauty and grandeur filled her mind at the sight of the mountains, now
first beheld in full majesty. She was almost overpowered by the vague and
solemn delight; but by-and-by her love for them equalled her awe, and in
the night-time she would softly rise, and steal to the window to see the
white moon-light, which gave a new aspect to the everlasting hills that
girdle the mountain village.</DD>

<DD>
Their breakfast-hour was late, in accordance with Mr. Bellingham's tastes
and habits; but Ruth was up betimes, and out and away, brushing the dewdrops
from the short crisp grass; the lark sung high above her head, and she
knew not if she moved or stood still, for the grandeur of this beautiful
earth absorbed all idea of separate and individual existence. Even rain
was a pleasure to her. She sat in the window-seat of their parlour (she
would have gone out gladly, but that such a proceeding annoyed Mr. Bellingham,
who usually at such times lounged away the listless hours on a sofa, and
relieved himself by abusing the weather); she saw the swift-fleeting showers
come athwart the sunlight like a rush of silver arrows; she watched the
purple darkness on the heathery mountain-side, and then the pale golden
gleam which succeeded. There was no change or alteration of nature that
had not its own peculiar beauty in the eyes of Ruth; but if she had complained
of the changeable climate, she would have pleased Mr. Bellingham more:
her admiration and her content made him angry, until her pretty motions
and loving eyes soothed down his impatience.</DD>

<DD>
"Really, Ruth," he exclaimed one day, when they had been imprisoned by
rain a whole morning, "one would think you had never seen a shower of rain
before; it quite wearies me to see you sitting there watching this detestable
weather with such a placid countenance; and for the last two hours you
have said nothing more amusing or interesting than--'Oh, how beautiful!'
or, 'There's another cloud coming across Moel Wynn.'"</DD>

<DD>
Ruth left her seat very gently, and took up her work. She wished she had
the gift of being amusing; it must be dull for a man accustomed to all
kinds of active employments to be shut up in the house. She was recalled
from her absolute self-forgetfulness. What could she say to interest Mr.
Bellingham? While she thought, he spoke again--</DD>

<DD>
"I remember when we were reading here three years ago, we had a week of
just such weather as this; but Howard and Johnson were capital whist-players,
and Wilbraham not bad, so we got through the days famously. Can you play
<I>ecarte</I>, Ruth, or picquet?"</DD>

<DD>
"No, sir; I have sometimes played at beggar-my-neighbour," answered Ruth
humbly, regretting her own deficiencies.</DD>

<DD>
He murmured impatiently, and there was silence for another half-hour. Then
he sprang up, and rang the bell violently. "Ask Mrs. Morgan for a pack
of cards. Ruthie, I'll teach you <I>ecarte</I>," said he.</DD>

<DD>
But Ruth was stupid, not so good as a dummy, he said; and it was no fun
betting against himself. So the cards were flung across the table--on the
floor--anywhere. Ruth picked them up. As she rose, she sighed a little
with the depression of spirits consequent upon her own want of power to
amuse and occupy him she loved.</DD>

<DD>
"You're pale, love!" said he, half repenting of his anger at her blunders
over the cards. "Go out before dinner; you know you don't mind this cursed
weather; and see that you come home full of adventures to relate. Come,
little blockhead! give me a kiss, and begone."</DD>

<DD>
She left the room with a feeling of relief; for if he were dull without
her, she should not feel responsible, and unhappy at her own stupidity.
The open air, that kind of soothing balm which gentle mother Nature offers
to us all in our seasons of depression, relieved her. The rain had ceased,
though every leaf and blade was loaded with trembling glittering drops.
Ruth went down to the circular dale, into which the brown foaming mountain
river fell and made a deep pool, and, after resting there for a while,
ran on between broken rocks down to the valley below. The water-fall was
magnificent, as she had anticipated; she longed to extend her walk to the
other side of the stream, so she sought the stepping-stones, the usual
crossing-place, which were overshadowed by trees, a few yards from the
pool. The waters ran high and rapidly, as busy as life, between the pieces
of grey rock; but Ruth had no fear, and went lightly and steadily on. About
the middle, however, there was a great gap; either one of the stones was
so covered with water as to be invisible, or it had been washed lower down;
at any rate, the spring from stone to stone was long, and Ruth hesitated
for a moment before taking it. The sound of rushing waters was in her ears
to the exclusion of every other noise; her eyes were on the current running
swiftly below her feet; and thus she was startled to see a figure close
before her on one of the stones, and to hear a voice offering help.</DD>

<DD>
She looked up and saw a man, who was apparently long past middle life,
and of the stature of a dwarf; a second glance accounted for the low height
of the speaker, for then she saw he was deformed. As the consciousness
of this infirmity came into her mind, it must have told itself in her softened
eyes; for a faint flush of colour came into the pale face of the deformed
gentleman, as he repeated his words--</DD>

<DD>
"The water is very rapid; will you take my hand? perhaps I can help you."</DD>

<DD>
Ruth accepted the offer, and with this assistance she was across in a moment.
He made way for her to precede him in the narrow wood path, and then silently
followed her up the glen.</DD>

<DD>
When they had passed out of the wood into the pasture-land beyond, Ruth
once more turned to mark him. She was struck afresh with the mild beauty
of the face, though there was something in the countenance which told of
the body's deformity, something more and beyond the pallor of habitual
ill-health, something of a quick spiritual light in the deep-set eyes,
a sensibility about the mouth; but altogether, though a peculiar, it was
a most attractive face.</DD>

<DD>
"Will you allow me to accompany you if you are going the round by Cwm Dhu,
as I imagine you are? The handrail is blown away from the little wooden
bridge by the storm last night, and the rush of waters below may make you
dizzy; and it is really dangerous to fall there, the stream is so deep."</DD>

<DD>
They walked on without much speech. She wondered who her companion might
be. She should have known him, if she had seen him among the strangers
at the inn; and yet he spoke English too well to be a Welshman; he knew
the country and the paths so perfectly, he must be a resident; and so she
tossed him from England to Wales, and back again, in her imagination.</DD>

<DD>
"I only came here yesterday," said he, as a widening in the path permitted
them to walk abreast. "Last night I went to the higher waterfalls; they
are most splendid."</DD>

<DD>
"Did you go out in all that rain?" asked Ruth timidly.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, yes. Rain never hinders me from walking. Indeed, it gives a new beauty
to such a country as this. Besides, my time for my excursion is so short,
I cannot afford to waste a day."</DD>

<DD>
"Then you do not live here?" asked Ruth.</DD>

<DD>
"No! my home is in a very different place. I live in a busy town, where
at times it is difficult to feel the truth that</DD>

<DD>
There are in this loud stunning tide</DD>

<DD>
Of human care and crime,</DD>

<DD>
With whom the melodies abide</DD>

<DD>
Of th' everlasting chime;</DD>

<DD>
Who carry music in their heart</DD>

<DD>
Through dusky lane and crowded mart,</DD>

<DD>
Plying their task with busier feet,</DD>

<DD>
Because their secret souls a holy strain repeat.'</DD>

<DD>
I have an annual holiday, which I generally spend in Wales; and often in
this immediate neighbourhood."</DD>

<DD>
"I do not wonder at your choice," replied Ruth. "It is a beautiful country."</DD>

<DD>
"It is, indeed; and I have been inoculated by an old inn-keeper at Conway
with a love for its people, and history, and traditions. I have picked
up enough of the language to understand many of their legends; and some
are very fine and awe-inspiring, others very poetic and fanciful."</DD>

<DD>
Ruth was too shy to keep up the conversation by any remark of her own,
although his gentle, pensive manner was very winning.</DD>

<DD>
"For instance," said he, touching a long bud-laden stem of foxglove in
the hedge-aide, at the bottom of which one or two crimson-speckled flowers
were bursting from their green sheaths, "I dare say, you don't know what
makes this fox-glove bend and sway so gracefully. You think it is blown
by the wind, don't you?" He looked at her with a grave smile, which did
not enliven his thoughtful eyes, but gave an inexpressible sweetness to
his face.</DD>

<DD>
"I always thought it was the wind. What is it?" asked Ruth innocently.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, the Welsh tell you that this flower is sacred to the fairies, and
that it has the power of recognising them, and all spiritual beings who
pass by, and that it bows in deference to them as they waft along. Its
Welsh name is Maneg Ellyllyn--the good people's glove; and hence, I imagine,
our folk's-glove or fox-glove."</DD>

<DD>
"It's a very pretty fancy," said Ruth, much interested, and wishing that
he would go on, without expecting her to reply.</DD>

<DD>
But they were already at the wooden bridge; he led her across, and then,
bowing his adieu, he had taken a different path even before Ruth had thanked
him for his attention.</DD>

<DD>
It was an adventure to tell Mr. Bellingham, however; and it aroused and
amused him till dinner-time came, after which he sauntered forth with a
cigar.</DD>

<DD>
"Ruth," said he, when he returned, "I've seen your little hunchback. He
looks like Riquet-with-the-Tuft. He's not a gentleman, though. If it had
not been for his deformity, I should not have made him out from your description;
you called him a gentleman."</DD>

<DD>
"And don't you?" asked Ruth, surprised.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, no! he's regularly shabby and seedy in his appearance; lodging, too,
the ostler told me, over that horrible candle-and-cheese shop, the smell
of which is insufferable twenty yards off--no gentleman could endure it;
he must be a traveller or artist, or something of that kind."</DD>

<DD>
"Did you see his face?" asked Ruth.</DD>

<DD>
"No; but a man's back--his <I>tout ensemble</I> has character enough in
it to decide his rank."</DD>

<DD>
"His face was very singular; quite beautiful!" said she softly; but the
subject did not interest Mr. Bellingham, and he let it drop.</DD>
