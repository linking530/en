If Mr. Bellingham did not get rapidly well, it was more owing to the morbid
querulous fancy attendant on great weakness than from any unfavourable
medical symptom. But he turned away with peevish loathing from the very
sight of food, prepared in the slovenly manner which had almost disgusted
him when he was well. It was of no use telling him that Simpson, his mother's
maid, had superintended the preparation at every point. He offended her
by detecting something offensive and to be avoided in her daintiest messes,
and made Mrs. Morgan mutter many a hasty speech, which, however, Mrs. Bellingham
thought it better not to hear until her son should be strong enough to
travel.</DD>

<DD>
"I think you are better to-day," said she, as his man wheeled his sofa
to the bedroom window. "We shall get you downstairs to-morrow."</DD>

<DD>
"If you were to get away from this abominable place, I could go down to-day;
but I believe I'm to be kept prisoner here for ever. I shall never get
well here, I'm sure."</DD>

<DD>
He sank back on his sofa in impatient despair. The surgeon was announced,
and eagerly questioned by Mrs. Bellingham as to the possibility of her
son's removal; and he, having heard the same anxiety for the same end expressed
by Mrs. Morgan in the regions below, threw no great obstacles in the way.
After the doctor had taken his departure, Mrs. Bellingham cleared her throat
several times. Mr. Bellingham knew the prelude of old, and winced with
nervous annoyance.</DD>

<DD>
"Henry, there is something I must speak to you about; an unpleasant subject,
certainly, but one which has been forced upon me by the very girl herself;
you must be aware to what I refer without giving me the pain of explainingmyself."</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Bellingham turned himself sharply round to the wall, and prepared himself
for a lecture by concealing his face from her notice; but she herself was
in too nervous a state to be capable of observation.</DD>

<DD>
"Of course," she continued, "it was my wish to be as blind to the whole
affair as possible, though you can't imagine how Mrs. Mason has blazoned
it abroad; all Fordham rings with it but of course it could not be pleasant,
or, indeed, I may say correct, for me to be aware that a person of such
improper character was under the same--I beg your pardon, dear Henry, what
do you say?"</DD>

<DD>
"Ruth is no improper character, mother; you do her injustice!"</DD>

<DD>
"My dear boy, you don't mean to uphold her as a paragon of virtue!"</DD>

<DD>
"No, mother, but I led her wrong; I----"</DD>

<DD>
"We will let all discussions into the cause or duration of her present
character drop, if you please," said Mrs. Bellingham, with the sort of
dignified authority which retained a certain power over her son--a power
which originated in childhood, and which he only defied when he was roused
into passion. He was too weak in body to oppose himself to her, and fight
the ground inch by inch. "As I have implied, I do not wish to ascertain
your share of blame; from what I saw of her one morning, I am convinced
of her forward, intrusive manners, utterly without shame, or even common
modesty."</DD>

<DD>
"What are you referring to?" asked Mr. Bellingham sharply.</DD>

<DD>
"Why, when you were at the worst, and I had been watching you all night,
and had just gone out in the morning for a breath of fresh air, this girl
pushed herself before me, and insisted upon speaking to me. I really had
to send Mrs. Morgan to her before I could return to your room. A more impudent,
hardened manner, I never saw."</DD>

<DD>
"Ruth was neither impudent nor hardened; she was ignorant enough, and might
offend from knowing no better."</DD>

<DD>
He was getting weary of the discussion, and wished it had never been begun.
From the time he had become conscious of his mother's presence he had felt
the dilemma he was in, in regard to Ruth, and various plans had directly
crossed his brain; but it had been so troublesome to weigh and consider
them all properly, that they had been put aside to be settled when he grew
stronger. But this difficulty in which he was placed by his connection
with Ruth, associated the idea of her in his mind with annoyance and angry
regret at the whole affair. He wished, in the languid way in which he wished
and felt everything not immediately relating to his daily comfort, that
he had never seen her. It was a most awkward, a most unfortunate affair.
Notwithstanding this annoyance connected with and arising out of Ruth,
he would not submit to hear her abused; and something in his manner impressed
this on his mother, for she immediately changed her mode of attack.</DD>

<DD>
"We may as well drop all dispute as to the young woman's manners; but I
suppose you do not mean to defend your connection with her; I suppose you
are not so lost to all sense of propriety as to imagine it fit or desirable
that your mother and this degraded girl should remain under the same roof,
liable to meet at any hour of the day?" She waited for an answer, but no
answer came.</DD>

<DD>
"I ask you a simple question; is it, or is it not, desirable?"</DD>

<DD>
"I suppose it is not," he replied gloomily.</DD>

<DD>
"And <I>I</I> suppose, from your manner, that you think the difficulty
would be best solved by my taking my departure, and leaving you with your
vicious companion?"</DD>

<DD>
Again no answer, but inward and increasing annoyance, of which Mr. Bellingham
considered Ruth the cause. At length he spoke--</DD>

<DD>
"Mother, you are not helping me in my difficulty. I have no desire to banish
you, nor to hurt you, after all your care for me. Ruth has not been so
much to blame as you imagine, that I must say; but I do not wish to see
her again, if you can tell me how to arrange it otherwise, without behaving
unhandsomely. Only spare me all this worry a while, I am so weak. I put
myself in your hands. Dismiss her, as you wish it; but let it be done handsomely,
and let me hear no more about it; I cannot bear it; let me have a quiet
life, without being lectured, while I am pent up here, and unable to shake
off unpleasant thoughts."</DD>

<DD>
"My dear Henry, rely upon me."</DD>

<DD>
"No more, mother; it's a bad business, and I can hardly avoid blaming myself
in the matter. I don't want to dwell upon it."</DD>

<DD>
"Don't be too severe in your self-reproaches while you are so feeble, dear
Henry; it is right to repent, but I have no doubt in. my own mind she led
you wrong with her artifices. But, as you say, everything should be done
handsomely. I confess I was deeply grieved when I first heard of the affair,
but since I have seen the girl---- Well! I'll say no more about her, since
I see it displeases you; but I am thankful to God that you see the error
of your ways.</DD>

<DD>
She sat silent, thinking for a little while, and then sent for her writing-case
and began to write. Her son became restless, and nervously irritated.</DD>

<DD>
"Mother," he said, "this affair worries me to death. I cannot shake off
the thoughts of it."</DD>

<DD>
"Leave it to me, I'll arrange it satisfactorily."</DD>

<DD>
"Could we not leave to-night? I should not be so haunted by this annoyance
in another place. I dread seeing her again, because I fear a scene; and
yet I believe I ought to see her in order to explain."</DD>

<DD>
"You must not think of such a thing, Henry," said she, alarmed at the very
idea. "Sooner than that, we will leave in half-an-hour, and try to get
to Pen tre Voelas to-night. It is not yet three, and the evenings are very
long. Simpson should stay and finish the packing; she could go straight
to London and meet us there. Macdonald and nurse could go with us. Could
you bear twenty miles, do you think?"</DD>

<DD>
Anything to get rid of his uneasiness. He felt that he was not behaving
as he should do to Ruth, though the really right never entered his head.
But it would extricate him from his present dilemma, and save him many
lectures; he knew that his mother, always liberal where money was concerned,
would "do the thing handsomely"; and it would always be easy to write and
give Ruth what explanation he felt inclined, in a day or two; so he consented,
and soon lost some of his uneasiness in watching the bustle of the preparation
for their departure.</DD>

<DD>
All this time Ruth was quietly spending in her room, beguiling the waiting,
weary hours, with pictures of the meeting at the end. Her room looked to
the back, and was in a side-wing away from the principal state apartments,
consequently she was not roused to suspicion by any of the commotion; but,
indeed, if she had heard the banging of doors, the sharp directions, the
carriage-wheels, she would still not have suspected the truth; her own
love was too faithful.</DD>

<DD>
It was four o'clock and past, when some one knocked at her door, and, on
entering, gave her a note, which Mrs. Bellingham had left. That lady had
found some difficulty in wording it so as to satisfy herself, but it was
as follows:--</DD>

<DD>
"My son, on recovering from his illness, is, I thank God, happily conscious
of the sinful way in which he has been living with you. By his earnest
desire, and in order to avoid seeing you again, we are on the point of
leaving this place; but, before I go, I wish to exhort you to repentance,
and to remind you that you will not have your own guilt alone upon your
head, but that of any young man whom you may succeed in entrapping into
vice. I shall pray that you may turn to an honest life, and I strongly
recommend you, if indeed you are not 'dead in trespasses and sins,' to
enter some penitentiary. In accordance with my son's wishes, I forward
you in this envelope a bank-note of fifty pounds.</DD>

<CENTER>
<DD>
"MARGARET BELLINGHAM."</DD></CENTER>

<DD>
Was this the end of all? Had he, indeed, gone? She started up, and asked
this last question of the servant, who, half guessing at the purport of
the note, had lingered about the room, curious to see the effect produced.</DD>

<DD>
"Iss, indeed, miss; the carriage drove from the door as I came upstairs.
You'll see it now on the Yspytty road, if you'll please to come to the
window of No. 24."</DD>

<DD>
Ruth started up and followed the chambermaid. Ay, there it was, slowly
winding up the steep, white road, on which it seemed to move at a snail's
pace.</DD>

<DD>
She might overtake him--she might--she might speak one farewell word to
him, print his face on her heart with a last look--nay, when he saw her
he might retract, and not utterly, for ever, leave her. Thus she thought;
and she flew back to her room, and snatching up her bonnet, ran, tying
the strings with her trembling hands as she went down the stairs, out at
the nearest door, little heeding the angry words of Mrs. Morgan; for the
hostess, more irritated at Mrs. Bellingham's severe upbraiding at parting,
than mollified by her ample payment, was offended by the circumstance of
Ruth, in her wild haste, passing through the prohibited front door.</DD>

<DD>
But Ruth was away before Mrs. Morgan had finished her speech, out and away,
scudding along the road, thought-lost in the breathless rapidity of her
motion. Though her heart and head beat almost to bursting, what did it
signify if she could but overtake the carriage? It was a nightmare, constantly
evading the most passionate wishes and endeavours, and constantly gaining
ground. Every time it was visible it was in fact more distant, but Ruth
would not believe it. If she could but gain the summit of that weary everlasting
hill, she believed that she could run again, and would soon be nigh upon
the carriage. As she ran she prayed with wild eagerness; she prayed that
she might see his face once more, even if she died on the spot before him.
It was one of those prayers which God is too merciful to grant; but, despairing
and wild as it was, Ruth put her soul into it, and prayed it again, and
yet again.</DD>

<DD>
Wave above wave of the ever-rising hills were gained, were crossed, and
at last Ruth struggled up to the very top and stood on the bare table of
moor, brown and purple, stretching far away till it was lost in the haze
of the summer afternoon; the white road was all flat before her, but the
carriage she sought, and the figure she sought, had disappeared. There
was no human being there; a few wild, black-faced mountain sheep, quietly
grazing near the road as if it were long since they had been disturbed,
by the passing of any vehicle, was all the life she saw on the bleak moorland.</DD>

<DD>
She threw herself down on the ling by the side of the road, in despair.
Her only hope was to die, and she believed she was dying. She could not
think; she could believe anything. Surely life was a horrible dream, and
God would mercifully awaken her from it? She had no penitence, no consciousness
of error or offence no knowledge of any one circumstance but that he was
gone. Yet afterwards--long afterwards--she remembered the exact motion
of a bright green beetle busily meandering among the wild thyme near her,
and she recalled the musical, balanced, wavering drop of a skylark into
her nest, near the heather-bed where she lay. The sun was sinking low,
the hot air had ceased to quiver near the hotter earth, when she bethought
her once more of the note which she had impatiently thrown down before
half mastering its contents. "Oh, perhaps," she thought, "I have been too
hasty. There may be some words of explanation from him on the other side
of the page, to which, in my blind anguish, I never turned. I will go and
find it."</DD>

<DD>
She lifted herself heavily and stiffly from the crushed heather. She stood
dizzy and confused with her change of posture; and was so unable to move
at first, that her walk was but slow and tottering; but, by-and-by, she
was tasked and goaded by thoughts which forced her into rapid motion, as
if, by it, she could escape from her agony. She came down on the level
ground, just as many gay or peaceful groups were sauntering leisurely home
with hearts at ease; with low laughs and quiet smiles, and many an exclamation
at the beauty of the summer evening.</DD>

<DD>
Ever since her adventure with the little boy and his sister, Ruth had habitually
avoided encountering these happy--innocents, may I call them?--these happy
fellow-mortals! And even now, the habit grounded on sorrowful humiliation
had power over her; she paused, and then, on looking back, she saw more
people who had come into the main road from a side-path. She opened a gate
into a pasture-field, and crept up to the hedge-bank until all should have
passed by, and she could steal into the inn unseen. She sat down on the
sloping turf by the roots of an old hawthorn tree which grew in the hedge;
she was still tearless, with hot burning eyes; she heard the merry walkers
pass by; she heard the footsteps of the village children as they ran along
to their evening play; she saw the small black cows come into the fields
after being milked; and life seemed yet abroad. When would the world be
still and dark, and fit for such a deserted, desolate creature as she was?
Even in her hiding-place she was not long at peace. The little children,
with their curious eyes peering here and there, had peeped through the
hedge, and through the gate, and now they gathered from all the four corners
of the hamlet, and crowded round the gate; and one more adventurous than
the rest had run into the field to cry, "Gi' me a halfpenny," which set
the example to every little one, emulous of his boldness; and there, where
she sat, low on the ground, and longing for the sure hiding-place earth
gives to the weary, the children kept running in, and pushing one another
forwards and laughing. Poor things! their time had not come for understanding
what sorrow is. Ruth would have begged them to leave her alone, and not
madden her utterly; but they knew no English save the one eternal "Gi'
me a halfpenny." She felt in her heart that there was no pity anywhere.
Suddenly, while she thus doubted God, a shadow fell across her garments,
on which her miserable eyes were bent. She looked up. The deformed gentleman
she had twice before seen stood there. He had been attracted by the noisy
little crowd, and had questioned them in Welsh; but, not understanding
enough of the language to comprehend their answers, he had obeyed their
signs, and entered the gate to which they pointed. There he saw the young
girl whom he had noticed at first for her innocent beauty, and the second
time for the idea he had gained respecting her situation; there he saw
her, crouched up like some hunted creature, with a wild, scared look of
despair, which almost made her lovely face seem fierce; he saw her dress
soiled and dim, her bonnet crushed and battered with her tossings to and
fro on the moorland bed; he saw the poor, lost wanderer, and when he saw
her he had compassion on her.</DD>

<DD>
There was some look of heavenly pity In his eyes, as gravely and sadly
they met her upturned gaze, which touched her stony heart. Still looking
at him, as if drawing some good influence from him, she said low and mournfully,
"He has left me, sir!--sir, he has indeed!--he has gone and left me!"</DD>

<DD>
Before he could speak a word to comfort her, she had burst into the wildest,
dreariest crying ever mortal cried. The settled form of the event, when
put into words, went sharp to her heart; her moans and sobs wrung his soul;
but, as no speech of his could be heard, if he had been able to decide
what best to say, he stood by her in apparent calmness, while she, wretched,
wailed and uttered her woe. But when she lay worn out, and stupefied into
silence, she heard him say to himself in a low voice--</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, my God! for Christ's sake, pity her I"</DD>

<DD>
Ruth lifted up her eyes, and looked at him with a dim perception of the
meaning of his words. She regarded him fixedly in a dreamy way, as if they
struck some chord in her heart, and she were listening to its echo; and
so it was. His pitiful look, or his words, reminded her of the childish
days when she knelt at her mother's knee; and she was only conscious of
a straining, longing desire to recall it all.</DD>

<DD>
He let her take her time, partly because he was powerfully affected himself
by all the circumstances, and by the sad pale face upturned to his; and
partly by an instinctive consciousness that the softest patience was required.
But suddenly she startled him, as she herself was startled into a keen
sense of the suffering agony of the present; she sprang up and pushed him
aside, and went rapidly towards the gate of the field. He could not move
as quickly as most men, but he put forth his utmost speed. He followed
across the road, on to the rocky common; but, as he went along, with his
uncertain gait, in the dusk gloaming, he stumbled, and fell over some sharp
projecting stone. The acute pain which shot up his back forced a short
cry from him; and, when bird and beast are hushed into rest and the stillness
of night is over all, a high-pitched sound, like the voice of pain, is
carried far in the quiet air. Ruth, speeding on in her despair, heard the
sharp utterance, and stopped suddenly short. It did what no remonstrance
could have done; it called her out of herself. The tender nature was in
her still, in that hour when all good angels seemed to have abandoned her.
In the old days she could never bear to hear or see bodily suffering in
any of God's meanest creatures, without trying to succour them; and now,
in her rush to the awful death of the suicide, she stayed her wild steps,
and turned to find from whom that sharp sound of anguish had issued.</DD>

<DD>
He lay among the white stones, too faint with pain to move, but with an
agony in his mind far keener than any bodily pain, as he thought that by
his unfortunate fall he had lost all chance of saving her. He was almost
over-powered by his intense thankfulness when he saw her white figure pause,
and stand listening, and turn again with slow footsteps, as if searching
for some lost thing. He could hardly speak, but he made a sound which,
though his heart was inexpressibly glad, was like a groan. She came quickly
towards him.</DD>

<DD>
"I am hurt," said he; "do not leave me;" his disabled and tender frame
was overcome by the accident and the previous emotions, and he fainted
away. Ruth flew to the little mountain stream, the dashing sound of whose
waters had been tempting her, but a moment before, to seek forgetfulness
in the deep pool into which they fell. She made a basin of her joined hands,
and carried enough of the cold fresh water back to dash into his face and
restore him to consciousness. While he still kept silence, uncertain what
to say best fitted to induce her to listen to him, she said softly--</DD>

<DD>
"Are you better, sir?--are you very much hurt?"</DD>

<DD>
"Not very much; I am better. Any quick movement is apt to cause me a sudden
loss of power in my back, and I believe I stumbled over some of these projecting
stones. It will soon go off; and you will help me to go home, I am sure."</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, yes! Can you go now? I am afraid of your lying too long on this heather;
there is a heavy dew."</DD>

<DD>
He was so anxious to comply with her wish, and not weary out her thought
for him, and so turn her back upon herself, that he tried to rise. The
pain was acute, and this she saw.</DD>

<DD>
"Don't hurry yourself, sir; I can wait."</DD>

<DD>
Then came across her mind the recollection of the business that was thus
deferred; but the few homely words which had been exchanged between them
seemed to have awakened her from her madness. She sat down by him, and
covering her face with her hands, cried mournfully and unceasingly. She
forgot his presence, and yet she had a consciousness that some one looked
for her kind offices, that she was wanted in the world, and must not rush
hastily out of it. The consciousness did not 'take this definite form,
it did not become a thought, but it kept her still, and it was gradually
soothing her.</DD>

<DD>
"Can you help me to rise now?" said he, after a while. She did not speak,
but she helped him up, and then he took her arm, and she led him tenderly
through all the little velvet paths, where the turf grew short and soft
between the rugged stones. Once more on the highway, they slowly passed
along in the moonlight. He guided her by a slight motion of the arm, through
the more unfrequented lanes, to his lodgings at the shop; for he thought
for her, and conceived the pain she would have in seeing the lighted windows
of the inn. He leant more heavily on her arm, as they awaited the opening
of the door.</DD>

<DD>
"Come in," said he, not relaxing his hold, and yet dreading to tighten
it, lest she should defy restraint, and once more rush away.</DD>

<DD>
They went slowly into the little parlour behind the shop. The bonny-looking
hostess, Mrs. Hughes by name, made haste to light the candle, and then
they saw each other, face to face. The deformed gentleman looked very pale,
but Ruth looked as if the shadow of death was upon her.</DD>
