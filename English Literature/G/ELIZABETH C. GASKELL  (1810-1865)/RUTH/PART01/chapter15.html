"Here is a parcel for you, Ruth!" said Miss Benson on the Tuesday morning.</DD>

<DD>
"For me!" said Ruth, all sorts of rushing thoughts and hopes filling her
mind, and turning her dizzy with expectation. If it had been from "him,"
the new-born resolutions would have had a bard struggle for existence.</DD>

<DD>
"It is directed 'Mrs. Denbigh,'" said Miss Benson, before giving it up.
"It is in Mrs. Bradshaw's handwriting;" and, far more curious than Ruth,
she awaited the untying of the close-knotted string. When the paper was
opened, it displayed a whole piece of delicate cambric muslin; and there
was a short note from Mrs. Bradshaw to Ruth, saying her husband had wished
her to send this muslin in aid of any preparations Mrs. Denbigh might have
to make. Ruth said nothing, but coloured up, and sat down again to her
employment.</DD>

<DD>
"Very fine muslin, indeed," said Miss Benson, feeling it, and holding it
up against the light, with the air of a connoisseur; yet all the time she
was glancing at Ruth's grave face. The latter kept silence, and showed
no wish to inspect her present further. At last she said, in a low voice--</DD>

<DD>
"I suppose I may send it back again?"</DD>

<DD>
"My dear child! send it back to Mr. Bradshaw! You'd offend him for life.
You may depend upon it, he means it as a mark of high favour!"</DD>

<DD>
"What right had he to send it me?" asked Ruth, still in her quiet voice.</DD>

<DD>
"What right? Mr. Bradshaw thinks---- I don't know exactly what you mean
by 'right.'"</DD>

<DD>
Ruth was silent for a moment, and then said--</DD>

<DD>
"There are people to whom I love to feel that I owe gratitude--gratitude
which I cannot express, and had better not talk about--but I cannot see
why a person whom I do not know should lay me under an obligation. Oh!
don't say I must take this muslin, please, Miss Benson!"</DD>

<DD>
What Miss Benson might have said if her brother had not just then entered
the room, neither he nor any other person could tell; but she felt his
presence was most opportune, and called him in as umpire. He had come hastily,
for he had much to do; but he no sooner heard the case than he sat down,
and tried to draw some more explicit declaration of her feeling from Ruth,
who had remained silent during Miss Benson's explanation.</DD>

<DD>
"You would rather send this present back?" said he.</DD>

<DD>
"Yes," she answered softly. "Is it wrong?"</DD>

<DD>
"Why do you want to return it?"</DD>

<DD>
"Because I feel as if Mr. Bradshaw had no right to offer it me."</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Benson was silent.</DD>

<DD>
"It's beautifully fine," said Miss Benson, still examining the piece.</DD>

<DD>
"You think that it is a right which must be earned?"</DD>

<DD>
"Yes," said she, after a minute's pause. "Don't you?"</DD>

<DD>
"I understand what you mean. It is a delight to have gifts made to you
by those whom you esteem and love, because then such gifts are merely to
be considered as fringes to the garment--as inconsiderable additions to
the mighty treasure of their affection, adding a grace, but no additional
value, to what before was precious, and proceeding as naturally out of
that as leaves burgeon out upon the trees; but you feel it to be different
when there is no regard for the giver to idealise the gift--when it simply
takes its stand among your property as so much money's value. Is this it,
Ruth?"</DD>

<DD>
"I think it is. I never reasoned why I felt as I did; I only knew that
Mr. Bradshaw's giving me a present hurt me, instead of making me glad."</DD>

<DD>
"Well, but there is another side of the case we have not looked at yet--we
must think of that, too. You know who said, 'Do unto others as ye would
that they should do unto you'? Mr. Bradshaw may not have had that in his
mind when he desired his wife to send you this; he may have been self-seeking,
and only anxious to gratify his love of patronising--that is the worst
motive we can give him; and that would be no excuse for your thinking only
of yourself, and returning his present."</DD>

<DD>
"But you would not have me pretend to be obliged?" asked Ruth.</DD>

<DD>
"No, I would not. I have often been similarly situated to you, Ruth; Mr.
Bradshaw has frequently opposed me on the points on which I feel the warmest--am
the most earnestly convinced. He, no doubt, thinks me Quixotic, and often
speaks of me, and to me, with great contempt when he is angry. I suppose
he has a little fit of penitence afterwards, or perhaps he thinks he can
pay for ungracious speeches by a present; so, formerly, he invariably sent
me something after these occasions. It was a time, of all others, to feel
as you are doing now; but I became convinced it would be right to accept
them, giving only the very cool thanks which I felt. This omission of all
show of much gratitude had the best effect--the presents have much diminished;
but, if the gifts have lessened, the unjustifiable speeches have decreased
in still greater proportion, and I am sure we respect each other more.
Take this muslin, Ruth, for the reason I named; and thank him as your feelings
prompt you. Overstrained expressions of gratitude always seem like an endeavour
to place the receiver of these expressions in the position of debtor for
future favours. But you won't fall into this error."</DD>

<DD>
Ruth listened to Mr. Benson; but she had not yet fallen sufficiently into
the tone of his mind to understand him fully. She only felt that he comprehended
her better than Miss Benson, who once more tried to reconcile her to her
present, by calling her attention to the length and breadth thereof.</DD>

<DD>
"I will do what you wish me," she said, after a little pause of thoughtfulness.
"May we talk of something else?"</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Benson saw that his sister's frame of mind was not particularly congenial
with Ruth's, any more than Ruth's was with Miss Benson's; and, putting
aside all thought of returning to the business which had appeared to him
so important when he came into the room (but which principally related
to himself), he remained above an hour in the parlour, interesting them
on subjects far removed from the present, and left them at the end of that
time soothed and calm.</DD>

<DD>
But the present gave a new current to Ruth's ideas. Her heart was as yet
too sore to speak, but her mind was crowded with plans. She asked Sally
to buy her (with the money produced by the sale of a ring or two) the coarsest
linen, the homeliest dark blue print, and similar materials; on which she
set busily to work to make clothes for herself; and as they were made,
she put them on; and as she put them on, she gave a grace to each, which
such homely material and simple shaping had never had before. Then the
fine linen and delicate soft white muslin, which she had chosen in preference
to more expensive articles of dress when Mr. Bellingham had given her <I>carte
blanche</I> in London, were cut into small garments, most daintily stitched
and made ready for the little creature, for whom in its white purity of
soul nothing could be too precious.</DD>

<DD>
The love which dictated this extreme simplicity and coarseness of attire,
was taken for stiff, hard economy by Mr. Bradshaw, when he deigned to observe
it. And economy by itself, without any soul or spirit in it to make it
living and holy, was a great merit in his eyes. Indeed, Ruth altogether
found favour with him. Her quiet manner, subdued by an internal consciousness
of a deeper cause for sorrow than he was aware of, he interpreted into
a very proper and becoming awe of him. He looked off from his own prayers
to observe how well she attended to hers at chapel; when he came to any
verse in the hymn relating to immortality or a future life, he sung it
unusually loud, thinking he should thus comfort her in her sorrow for her
deceased husband. He desired Mrs. Bradshaw to pay her every attention she
could; and even once remarked, that he thought her so respectable a young
person that he should. not object to her being asked to tea the next time
Mr. and Miss Benson came. He added, that he thought, indeed, Benson had
looked last Sunday as if he rather hoped to get an invitation; and it was
right to encourage the ministers, and to show them respect, even though
their salaries were small. The only thing against this Mrs. Denbigh was
the circumstance of her having married too early, and without any provision
for a family. Though Ruth pleaded delicacy of health, and declined accompanying
Mr. and Miss Benson on their visit to Mr. Bradshaw, she still preserved
her place in his esteem; and Miss Benson had to call a little upon her
"talent for fiction" to spare Ruth from the infliction of further presents,
in making which his love of patronising delighted.</DD>

<DD>
The yellow and crimson leaves came floating down on the still October air;
November followed, bleak and dreary; it was more cheerful when the earth
put on her beautiful robe of white, which covered up all the grey naked
stems, and loaded the leaves of the hollies and evergreens each with its
burden of feathery snow. When Ruth sat down to languor and sadness, Miss
Benson trotted upstairs, and rummaged up every article of spare or worn-out
clothing, and bringing down a variety of strange materials, she tried to
interest Ruth in making them up into garments for the poor. But, though
Ruth's fingers flew through the work, she still sighed with thought and
remembrance. Miss Benson was at first disappointed, and then she was angry.
When she heard the low, long sigh, and saw the dreamy eyes filling with
glittering tears, she would say, "What is the matter, Ruth?" in a half-reproachful
tone, for the sight of suffering was painful to her; she had done all in
her power to remedy it; and, though she acknowledged a cause beyond her
reach for Ruth's deep sorrow, and, in fact, loved and respected her all
the more for these manifestations of grief, yet at the time they irritated
her. Then Ruth would snatch up the dropped work, and stitch away with drooping
eyes, from which the hot tears fell fast; and Miss Benson was then angry
with herself, yet not at all inclined to agree with Sally when she asked
her mistress "why she kept 'mithering' the poor lass with asking her for
ever what was the matter, as if she did not know well enough." Some element
of harmony was wanting--some little angel of peace, in loving whom all
hearts and natures should be drawn together, and their discords hushed.</DD>

<DD>
The earth was still "hiding her guilty front with innocent snow," when
a little baby was laid by the side of the pale, white mother. It was a
boy; beforehand she had wished for a girl, as being less likely to feel
the want of a father--as being what a mother, worse than widowed, could
most effectually shelter. But now she did not think or remember this. What
it was, she would not have exchanged for a wilderness of girls. It was
her own, her darling, her individual baby, already, though not an hour
old, separate and sole in her heart, strangely filling up its measure with
love and peace, and even hope. For here was a new, pure, beautiful, innocent
life, which she fondly imagined, in that early passion of maternal love,
she could guard from every touch of corrupting sin by ever watchful and
most tender care. And <I>her</I> mother had thought the same, most probably;
and thousands of others think the same, and pray to God to purify and cleanse
their souls, that they may be fit guardians for their little children.
Oh, how Ruth prayed, even while she was yet too weak to speak; and how
she felt the beauty and significance of the words, "Our Father!"</DD>

<DD>
She was roused from this holy abstraction by the sound of Miss Benson's
voice. It was very much as if she had been crying.</DD>

<DD>
"Look, Ruth!" it said softly, "my brother sends you these. They are the
first snowdrops in the garden." And she put them on the pillow by Ruth;
the baby lay on the opposite side.</DD>

<DD>
"Won't you look at him?" said Ruth; "he is so pretty!"</DD>

<DD>
Miss Benson had a strange reluctance to see him. To Ruth, in spite of all
that had come and gone, she was reconciled--nay, more, she was deeply attached;
but over the baby there hung a cloud of shame and disgrace. Poor little
creature! her heart was closed against it--firmly, as she thought. But
she could not resist Ruth's low faint voice, nor her pleading eyes, and
she went round to peep at him as he lay on his mother's arm, as yet his
shield and guard.</DD>

<DD>
"Sally says he will have black hair, she thinks," said Ruth. "His little
hand is quite a man's, already. Just feel how firmly he closes it;" and
with her own weak fingers she opened his little red fist, and taking Miss
Benson's reluctant hand, placed one of her fingers in his grasp. That baby-touch
called out her love; the doors of her heart were thrown open wide for the
little infant to go in and take possession.</DD>

<DD>
"Ah, my darling!" said Ruth, failing back weak and weary. "If God will
but spare you to me, never mother did more than I will. I have done you
a grievous wrong--but, if I may but live, I will spend my life in serving
you!"</DD>

<DD>
"And in serving God!" said Miss Benson, with tears in her eyes. "You must
not make him into an idol, or God will, perhaps, punish you through him."</DD>

<DD>
A pang of affright shot through Ruth's heart at these words; had she already
sinned and made her child into an idol, and was there punishment already
in store for her through him? But then the internal voice whispered that
God was "Our Father," and that He knew our frame, and knew how natural
was the first outburst of a mother's love; so, although she treasured up
the warning, she ceased to affright herself for what had already gushed
forth.</DD>

<DD>
"Now go to sleep, Ruth," said Miss Benson, kissing her, and darkening the
room. But Ruth could not sleep; if her heavy eyes closed, she opened them
again with a start, for sleep seemed to be an enemy stealing from her the
consciousness of being a mother. That one thought excluded all remembrance
and all anticipation, in those first hours of delight.</DD>

<DD>
But soon remembrance and anticipation came. There was the natural want
of the person, who alone could take an interest similar in kind, though
not in amount, to the mother's. And sadness grew like a giant in the still
watches of the night, when she remembered that there would be no father
to guide and strengthen the child, and place him in a favourable position
for fighting the hard "Battle of Life." She hoped and believed that no
one would know the sin of his parents; and that that struggle might be
spared to him. But a father's powerful care and mighty guidance would never
be his; and then, in those hours of spiritual purification, came the wonder
and the doubt of how far the real father would be the one to whom, with
her desire of heaven for her child, whatever might become of herself, she
would wish to intrust him. Slight speeches, telling of a selfish, worldly
nature, unnoticed at the time, came back upon her ear, having a new significance.
They told of a low standard, of impatient self-indulgence, of no acknowledgment
of things spiritual and heavenly. Even while this examination was forced
upon her, by the new spirit of maternity that had entered into her and
made her child's welfare supreme, she hated and reproached herself for
the necessity there seemed upon her of examining and judging the absent
father of her child. And so the compelling presence that had taken possession
of her wearied her into a kind of feverish slumber; in which she dreamt
that the innocent babe that lay by her side in soft ruddy slumber, had
started up into man's growth, and, instead of the pure and noble being
whom she had prayed to present as her child to "Our Father in heaven,"
he was a repetition of his father; and, like him, lured some maiden (who
in her dream seemed strangely like herself, only more utterly sad and desolate
even than she) into sin, and left her there to even a worse fate than that
of suicide. For Ruth believed there was a worse. She dreamt she saw the
girl, wandering, lost; and that she saw her son in high places, prosperous--but
with more than blood on his soul. She saw her son dragged down by the clinging
girl into some pit of horrors into which she dared not look, but from whence
his father's voice was heard, crying aloud, that in his day and generation
he had not remembered the words of God, and that now he was "tormented
in this flame." Then she started in sick terror, and saw, by the dim rushlight,
Sally, nodding in an armchair by the fire; and felt her little soft warm
babe, nestled up against her breast, rocked by her heart, which yet beat
hard from the effects of the evil dream. She dared not go to sleep again,
but prayed. And, every time she prayed, she asked with a more complete
wisdom, and a more utter and self-forgetting faith. Little child! thy angel
was with God, and drew her nearer and nearer to Him, whose face is continually
beheld by the angels of little children.</DD>
