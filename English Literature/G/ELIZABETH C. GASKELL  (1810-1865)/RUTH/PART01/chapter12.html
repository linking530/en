Miss Benson continued in an undecided state of mind for the two next days;
but on the third, as they sat at breakfast, she began to speak to her brother.</DD>

<DD>
"That young creature's name is Ruth Hilton."</DD>

<DD>
"Indeed! how did you find it out?"</DD>

<DD>
"From herself, of course. She is much stronger. I slept with her last night,
and I was aware she was awake long before I liked to speak, but at last
I began. I don't know what I said, or how it went on, but I think it was
a little relief to her to tell me something about herself. She sobbed and
cried herself to sleep; I think she is asleep now.</DD>

<DD>
"Tell me what she said about herself."</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, it was really very little; it was evidently a most painful subject.
She is an orphan, without brother or sister, and with a guardian, whom,
I think she said, she never saw but once. He apprenticed her (after her
father's death) to a dressmaker. This Mr. Bellingham got acquainted with
her, and they used to meet on Sunday afternoons. One day they were late,
lingering on the road, when the dressmaker came up by accident. She seems
to have been very angry, and not unnaturally so. The girl took fright at
her threats, and the lover persuaded her to go off with him to London,
there and then. Last May, I think it was. That's all."</DD>

<DD>
"Did she express any sorrow for her error?"</DD>

<DD>
"No, not in words; but her voice was broken with sobs, though she tried
to make it steady. After a while she began to talk about her baby, but
shyly, and with much hesitation. She asked me, how much I thought she could
earn as a dressmaker, by working very, very hard; and that brought us round
to her child. I thought of what you had said, Thurstan, and I tried to
speak to her as you wished me. I am not sure if it was right; I am doubtful
in my own mind still."</DD>

<DD>
"Don't be doubtful, Faith! Dear Faith, I thank you for your kindness."</DD>

<DD>
"There is really nothing to thank me for. It is almost impossible to help
being kind to her; there is something so meek and gentle about her, so
patient, and so grateful!"</DD>

<DD>
"What does she think of doing?"</DD>

<DD>
"Poor child! she thinks of taking lodgings--very cheap ones, she says;
there she means to work night and day to earn enough for her child. For
she said to me; with such pretty earnestness, 'It must never know want,
whatever I do. I have deserved suffering, but it will be such a little
innocent darling!' Her utmost earnings would not be more than seven or
eight shillings a week, I'm afraid; and then she is so young and so pretty!"</DD>

<DD>
"There is that fifty pounds Mrs. Morgan brought me, and those two letters.
Does she know about them yet?"</DD>

<DD>
"No; I did not like to tell her till she is a little stronger. Oh, Thurstan!
I wish there was not this prospect of a child. I cannot help it. I do--I
could see a way in which we might help her, if it were not for that."</DD>

<DD>
"How do you mean?"</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, it's no use thinking of it, as it is! Or else we might have taken
her home with us, and kept her till she had got a little dressmaking in
the congregation, but for this meddlesome child; that spoils everything.
You must let me grumble to you, Thurstan. I was very good to her, and spoke
as tenderly and respectfully of the little thing as if it were the Queen's,
and born in lawful matrimony."</DD>

<DD>
"That's right, my dear Faith! Grumble away to me, if you like. I'll forgive
you, for the kind thought of taking her home with us. But do you think
her situation is an insuperable objection?"</DD>

<DD>
"Why, Thurstan!--it's so insuperable, it puts it quite out of the question."</DD>

<DD>
"How?--that's only repeating your objection. Why is it out of the question?"</DD>

<DD>
"If there had been no child coming, we might have called her by her right
name--Miss Hilton; that's one thing. Then, another is, the baby in our
house. Why, Sally would go distraught!"</DD>

<DD>
"Never mind Sally. If she were an orphan relation of our own, left widowed,"
said he, pausing as if in doubt. "You yourself suggested she should be
considered as a widow, for the child's sake. I'm only taking up your ideas,
dear Faith. I respect you for thinking of taking her home; it is just what
we ought to do. Thank you for reminding me of my duty."</DD>

<DD>
"Nay, it was only a passing thought. Think of Mr. Bradshaw. Oh! I tremble
at the thought of his grim displeasure."</DD>

<DD>
"We must think of a higher than Mr. Bradshaw. I own I should be a very
coward if he knew. He is so severe, so inflexible. But after all he sees
so little of us; he never comes to tea, you know, but is always engaged
when Mrs. Bradshaw comes. I don't think he knows of what our household
consists."</DD>

<DD>
"Not know Sally? Oh yes, but he does. He asked Mrs. Bradshaw one day if
she knew what wages we gave her, and said we might get a far more efficient
and younger servant for the money. And, speaking about money, think what
our expenses would be if we took her home for the next six months."</DD>

<DD>
That consideration was a puzzling one; and both sat silent and perplexed
for a time. Miss Benson was as sorrowful as her brother, for she was becoming
as anxious as he was to find it possible that her plan could be carried
out</DD>

<DD>
"There's the fifty pounds," said he, with a sigh of reluctance at the idea.</DD>

<DD>
"Yes, there's the fifty pounds," echoed his sister, with the same sadness
in her tone. "I suppose it is hers."</DD>

<DD>
"I suppose it is; and, being so, we must not think who gave it to her.
It will defray her expenses. I am very sorry, but I think we must take
it."</DD>

<DD>
"It would never do to apply to him under the present circumstances," said
Miss Benson, in a hesitating manner.</DD>

<DD>
"No, that we won't," said her brother decisively. "If she consents to let
us take care of her, we will never let her stoop to request anything from
him, even for his child. She can live on bread and water--we can all live
on bread and water--rather than that."</DD>

<DD>
"Then I will speak to her and propose the plan. Oh, Thurstan! from a child
you could persuade me to anything! I hope I am doing right. However much
I oppose you at first, I am sure to yield soon; almost in proportion to
my violence at first. I think I am very weak."</DD>

<DD>
"No, not in this instance. We are both right: I, in the way in which the
child ought to be viewed; you, dear good Faith, for thinking of taking
her home with us. God bless you, dear, for it!"</DD>

<DD>
When Ruth began to sit up (and the strange, new, delicious prospect of
becoming a mother seemed to give her some mysterious source of strength,
so that her recovery was rapid and swift from that time), Miss Benson brought
her the letters and the bank-note.</DD>

<DD>
"Do you recollect receiving this letter, Ruth?" asked she, with grave gentleness.
Ruth changed colour, and took it and read it again without making any reply
to Miss Benson. Then she sighed, and thought a while; and then took up
and read the second note--the note which Mrs. Bellingham had sent to Mr.
Benson in answer to his. After that she took up the bank-note and turned
it round and round, but not as if she saw it. Miss Benson noticed that
her fingers trembled sadly, and that her lips were quivering for some time
before she spoke.</DD>

<DD>
"If you please, Miss Benson, I should like to return this money."</DD>

<DD>
"Why, my dear?"</DD>

<DD>
"I have a strong feeling against taking it. While he," said she, deeply
blushing, and letting her large white lids drop down and veil her eyes,
"loved me, he gave me many things--my watch--oh, many things; and I took
them from him gladly and thankfully, because he loved me--for I would have
given him anything--and I thought of them as signs of love. But this money
pains my heart. He has left off loving me, and has gone away. This money
seems--oh, Miss Benson--it seems as if he could comfort me, for being forsaken,
by money." And at that word the tears, so long kept back and repressed,
forced their way like rain.</DD>

<DD>
She checked herself, however, in the violence of her emotion, for she thought
of her child.</DD>

<DD>
"So, will you take the trouble of sending it back to Mrs. Bellingham?"</DD>

<DD>
"That I will, my dear. I am glad of it, that I am! They don't deserve to
have the power of giving: they don't deserve that you should take it."</DD>

<DD>
Miss Benson went and enclosed it up there and then; simply writing these
words in the envelope, "From Ruth Hilton."</DD>

<DD>
"And now we wash our hands of these Bellinghams," said she triumphantly.
But Ruth looked tearful and sad; not about returning the note, but from
the conviction that the reason she had given for the ground of her determination
was true--he no longer loved her.</DD>

<DD>
To cheer her, Miss Benson began to speak of the future. Miss Benson was
one of those people who, the more she spoke of a plan in its details, and
the more she realised it in her own mind, the more firmly she became a
partisan of the project. Thus she grew warm and happy in the idea of taking
Ruth home; but Ruth remained depressed and languid under the conviction
that he no longer loved her. No home, no future, but the thought of her
child, could wean her from this sorrow. Miss Benson was a little piqued;
and this pique showed itself afterwards in talking to her brother of the
morning's proceedings in the sick chamber.</DD>

<DD>
"I admired her at the time for sending away her fifty pounds so proudly;
but I think she has a cold heart: she hardly thanked me at all for my proposal
of taking her home with us."</DD>

<DD>
"Her thoughts are full of other things just now; and people have such different
ways of showing feeling: some by silence, some by words. At any rate, it
is unwise to expect gratitude."</DD>

<DD>
"What do you expect--not indifference or ingratitude?"</DD>

<DD>
"It is better not to expect or calculate consequences. The longer I live,
the more fully I see that. Let us try simply to do right actions, without
thinking of the feelings they are to call out in others. We know that no
holy or self-denying effort can fall to the ground vain and useless; but
the sweep of eternity is large, and God alone knows when the effect is
to be produced. We are trying to do right now, and to feel right; don't
let us perplex ourselves with endeavouring to map out how she should feel,
or how she should show her feelings."</DD>

<DD>
"That's all very fine, and I dare say very true," said Miss Benson, a little
chagrined. "But 'a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush;' and I would
rather have had one good, hearty, 'Thank you,' now, for all I have been
planning to do for her, than the grand effects you promise me in the 'sweep
of eternity.' Don't be grave and sorrowful, Thurstan, or I'll go out of
the room. I can stand Sally's scoldings, but I can't bear your look of
quiet depression whenever I am a little hasty or impatient. I had rather
you would give me a good box on the ear."</DD>

<DD>
"And I would often rather you would speak, if ever so hastily, instead
of whistling. So, if I box your ears when I am vexed with you, will you
promise to scold me when you are put out of the way, instead of whistling?"</DD>

<DD>
"Very well! that's a bargain. You box, and I scold. But, seriously, I began
to calculate our money when she so cavalierly sent off the fifty-pound
note (I can't help admiring her for it!), and I am very much afraid we
shall not have enough to pay the doctor's bill, and take her home with
us."</DD>

<DD>
"She must go inside the coach, whatever we do," said Mr. Benson decidedly.
"Who's there? Come in! Oh! Mrs. Hughes! Sit down."</DD>

<DD>
"Indeed, sir, and I cannot stay; but the young lady has just made me find
up her watch for her, and asked me to get it sold to pay the doctor, and
the little things she has had since she came; and please, sir, indeed I
don't know where to sell it nearer than Caernarvon."</DD>

<DD>
"That is good of her," said Miss Benson, her sense of justice satisfied;
and, remembering the way in which Ruth had spoken of the watch, she felt
what a sacrifice it must have been to resolve to part with it.</DD>

<DD>
"And her goodness just helps us out of our dilemma," said her brother;
who was unaware of the feelings with which Ruth regarded her watch, or,
perhaps, he might have parted with his Facciolati.</DD>

<DD>
Mrs. Hughes patiently awaited their leisure for answering her practical
question. Where could the watch be sold? Suddenly her face brightened.</DD>

<DD>
"Mr. Jones, the doctor, is just going to be married, perhaps he would like
nothing better than to give this pretty watch to his bride; indeed, and
I think it's very likely; and he'll pay money for it as well as letting
alone his bill. I'll ask him, sir, at any rate."</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Jones was only too glad to obtain possession of so elegant a present
at so cheap a rate. He even, as Mrs. Hughes had foretold, "paid money for
it;" more than was required to defray the expenses of Ruth's accommodation,
as most of the articles of food she had were paid for at the time by Mr.
or Miss Benson, but they strictly forbade Mrs. Hughes to tell Ruth of this.</DD>

<DD>
"Would you object to my buying you a black gown?" said Miss Benson to her,
the day after the sale of the watch. She hesitated a little, and then went
on--</DD>

<DD>
"My brother and I think it would be better to call you--as if in fact you
were--a widow. It will save much awkwardness, and it will spare your child
much"----mortification, she was going to have added; but that word did
not exactly do. But, at the mention of her child, Ruth started, and turned
ruby-red; as she always did when allusion was made to it.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, yes! certainly. Thank you much for thinking of it. Indeed," said she,
very low, as if to herself, "I don't know how to thank you for all you
are doing; but I do love you, and will pray for you, if I may."</DD>

<DD>
"If you may, Ruth" repeated Miss Benson, in a tone of surprise.</DD>

<DD>
"Yes, if I may. If you will let me pray for you."</DD>

<DD>
"Certainly, my dear. My dear Ruth, you don't know how often I sin; I do
so wrong, with my few temptations. We are both of us great sinners in the
eyes of the Most Holy; let us pray for each other. Don't speak so again,
my dear; at least, not to me."</DD>

<DD>
Miss Benson was actually crying. She had always looked upon herself as
so inferior to her brother in real goodness, had seen such heights above
her, that she was distressed by Ruth's humility. After a short time she
resumed the subject.</DD>

<DD>
"Then I may get you a black gown?--and we may call you Mrs. Hilton?"</DD>

<DD>
"No; not Mrs. Hilton!" said Ruth hastily.</DD>

<DD>
Miss Benson, who had hitherto kept her eyes averted from Ruth's face from
a motive of kindly delicacy, now looked at her with surprise.</DD>

<DD>
"Why not?" asked she.</DD>

<DD>
"It was my mother's name," said Ruth, in a low voice. "I had better not
be called by it."</DD>

<DD>
"Then let us call you by my mother's name," said Miss Benson tenderly.
"She would have---- But I'll talk to you about my mother some other time.
Let me call you Mrs. Denbigh. It will do very well, too. People will think
you are a distant relation."</DD>

<DD>
When she told Mr. Benson of this choice of name, he was rather sorry; it
was like his sister's impulsive kindness--impulsive in everything--and
he could imagine how Ruth's humility had touched her. He was sorry, but
hesaid nothing.</DD>

<DD>
And now the letter was written home, announcing the probable arrival of
the brother and sister on a certain day, "with a distant relation, early
left a widow," as Miss Benson expressed it. She desired the spare room
might be prepared, and made every provision she could think of for Ruth's
comfort; for Ruth still remained feeble and weak.</DD>

<DD>
When the black gown, at which she had stitched away incessantly, was finished--when
nothing remained, but to rest for the next day's journey--Ruth could not
sit still. She wandered from window to window, learning off each rock and
tree by heart. Each had its tale, which it was agony to remember; but which
it would have been worse agony to forget. The sound of running waters she
heard that quiet evening was in her ears as she lay on her death-bed; so
well had she learnt their tune.</DD>

<DD>
And now all was over. She had driven in to Llan-dhu, sitting by her lover's
side, living in the bright present, and strangely forgetful of the past
or the future; she had dreamed out her dream, and she had awakened from
the vision of love. She walked slowly and sadly down the long hill, her
tears fast falling, but as quickly wiped away; while she strove to make
steady the low quivering voice which was often called. upon to answer some
remark of Miss Benson's.</DD>

<DD>
They had to wait for the coach. Ruth buried her face in some flowers which
Mrs. Hughes had given her on parting; and was startled when the mail drew
up with a sudden pull, which almost threw the horses on their haunches.
She was placed inside, and the coach had set off again, before she was
fully aware that Mr. and Miss Benson were travelling on the outside; but
it was a relief to feel she might now cry without exciting their notice.
The shadow of a heavy thunder-cloud was on the valley, but the little upland
village-church (that showed the spot in which so much of her life was passed)
stood out clear in the sunshine. She grudged the tears that blinded her
as she gazed. There was one passenger, who tried after a while to comfort
her.</DD>

<DD>
"Don't cry, miss," said the kind-hearted woman. "You're parting from friends,
maybe? Well, that's bad enough; but, when you come to my age, you'll think
none of it. Why, I've three sons, and they're soldiers and sailors, all
of them--here, there, and everywhere. One is in America, beyond the seas;
another is in China, making tea; and another is at Gibraltar, three miles
from Spain; and yet, you see, I can laugh and eat and enjoy myself. I sometimes
think I'll try and fret a bit, just to make myself a better figure: but,
Lord! it's no use, it's against my nature; so I laugh and grow fat again.
I'd be quite thankful for a fit of anxiety as would make me feel easy in
my clothes, which them manty-makers will make so tight I'm fairly throttled."</DD>

<DD>
Ruth durst cry no more; it was no relief, now she was watched and noticed,
and plied with a sandwich or a ginger-bread each time she looked sad. She
lay back with her eyes shut, as if asleep, and went on, and on, the sun
never seeming to move from his high place in the sky, nor the bright hot
day to show the least sign of waning. Every now and then Miss Benson scrambled
down, and made kind inquiries of the pale, weary Ruth; and once they changed
coaches, and the fat old lady left her with a hearty shake of the hand.</DD>

<DD>
"It is not much further now," said Miss Benson, apologetically, to Ruth.
"See! we are losing sight of the Welsh mountains. We have about eighteen
miles of plain, and then we come to the moors and the rising ground, amidst
which Eccleston lies. I wish we were there, for my brother is sadly tired."</DD>

<DD>
The first wonder in Ruth's mind was, why then, if Mr. Benson was so tired,
did they not stop where they were for the night; for she knew little of
the expenses of a night at an inn. The next thought was, to beg that Mr.
Benson would take her place inside the coach, and allow her to mount up
by Miss Benson. She proposed this, and Miss Benson was evidently pleased.</DD>

<DD>
"Well, if you're not tired, it would be a rest and a change for him, to
be sure; and if you were by me I could show you the first sight of Eccleston,
if we reach there before it is quite dark."</DD>

<DD>
So Mr. Benson got down, and changed places with Ruth.</DD>

<DD>
She hardly yet understood the numerous small economies which he and his
sister had to practise--the little daily self-denials--all endured so cheerfully
and simply, that they had almost ceased to require an effort, and it had
become natural to them to think of others before themselves. Ruth had not
understood that it was for economy that their places had been taken on
the outside of the coach, while hers, as an invalid requiring rest, was
to be the inside; and that the biscuits which supplied the place of a dinner
were, in fact, chosen because the difference in price between the two would
go a little way towards fulfilling their plan for receiving her as an inmate.
Her thought about money had been hitherto a child's thought; the subject
had never touched her; but afterwards, when she had lived a little while
with the Bensons, her eyes were opened, and she remembered their simple
kindness on the journey, and treasured the remembrance of it in her heart.</DD>

<DD>
A low grey cloud was the first sign of Eccleston; it was the smoke of the
town hanging over the plain. Beyond the place where she was expected to
believe it existed, arose round, waving uplands; nothing to the fine outlines
of the Welsh mountains, but still going up nearer to heaven than the rest
of the flat world into which she had now entered. Rumbling stones, lamp-posts,
a sudden stop, and they were in the town of Eccleston; and a strange, uncouth
voice, on the dark side of the coach, was heard to say--</DD>

<DD>
"Be ye there, measter?"</DD>

<DD>
"Yes, yes!" said Miss Benson quickly. "Did Sally send you, Ben? Get the
ostler's lantern, and look out the luggage."</DD>
