<DD>
The next day the weather was brave and glorious; a perfect "bridal of the
earth and sky;" and every one turned out of the inn to enjoy the fresh
beauty of nature. Ruth was quite unconscious of being the object of remark;
and, in her light, rapid passings to and fro, had never looked at the doors
and windows, where many watchers stood observing her, and commenting upon
her situation or her appearance.</DD>

<DD>
"She's a very lovely creature," said one gentleman, rising from the breakfast-table
to catch a glimpse of her as she entered from her morning's ramble. "Not
above sixteen I should think. Very modest and innocent-looking in her white
gown!"</DD>

<DD>
His wife, busy administering to the wants of a fine little boy, could only
say (without seeing the young girl's modest ways, and gentle, downcast
countenance)--</DD>

<DD>
"Well! I do think it's a shame such people should be allowed to come here.
To think of such wickedness under the same roof! Do come away, my dear,
and don't flatter her by such notice."</DD>

<DD>
The husband returned to the breakfast-table; he smelt the broiled ham and
eggs, and he heard his wife's commands. Whether smelling or hearing had
most to do in causing his obedience, I cannot tell; perhaps you can.</DD>

<DD>
"Now, Harry, go and see if nurse and baby are ready to go out with you.
You must lose no time this beautiful morning."</DD>

<DD>
Ruth found Mr. Bellingham was not yet come down; so she sallied out for
an additional half-hour's ramble. Flitting about through the village, trying
to catch all the beautiful sunny peeps at the scenery between the cold
stone houses, which threw the radiant distance into aerial perspective
far away, she passed by the little shop; and, just issuing from it, came
the nurse and baby, and little boy. The baby sat in placid dignity in her
nurse's arms, with a face of queenly calm. Her fresh, soft, peachy complexion
was really tempting; and Ruth, who was always fond of children, went up
to coo and to smile at the little thing, and after some "peep-boing," she
was about to snatch a kiss, when Harry, whose face had been reddening ever
since the play began, lifted up his sturdy little right arm and hit Ruth
a great blow on the face.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, for shame, sir!" said the nurse, snatching back his hand; "how dare
you do that to the lady who is so kind as to speak to Sissy!"</DD>

<DD>
"She's not a lady!" said he indignantly. "She's a bad, naughty girl--mamma;
said so, she did; and she shan't kiss our baby."</DD>

<DD>
The nurse reddened in her turn. She knew what he must have heard; but it
was awkward to bring it out, standing face to face with the elegant young
lady.</DD>

<DD>
"Children pick up such notions, ma'am," said she at last, apologetically,
to Ruth, who stood, white and still, with a new idea running through her
mind.</DD>

<DD>
"It's no notion; it's true, nurse; and I heard you say it yourself. Go
away, naughty woman!" said the boy, in infantile vehemence of passion to
Ruth.</DD>

<DD>
To the nurse's infinite relief, Ruth turned away, humbly and meekly, with
bent head, and slow, uncertain steps. But as she turned, she saw the mild
sad face of the deformed gentleman, who was sitting at the open window
above the shop; he looked sadder and graver than ever; and his eyes met
her glance with an expression of deep sorrow. And so, condemned alike by
youth and age, she stole with timid step into the house. Mr. Bellingham
was awaiting her in the sitting-room. The glorious day restored all his
buoyancy of spirits. He talked gaily away, without pausing for a reply;
while Ruth made tea, and tried to calm her heart, which was yet beating
with the agitation of the new ideas she had received from the occurrence
of the morning. Luckily for her, the only answers required for some time
were mono-syllables; but those few words were uttered in so depressed and
mournful a tone, that at last they struck Mr. Bellingham with surprise
and displeasure, as the condition of mind they unconsciously implied did
not harmonise with his own.</DD>

<DD>
"Ruth, what is the matter this morning? You really are very provoking.
Yesterday, when everything was gloomy, and you might have been aware that
I was out of spirits, I heard nothing but expressions of delight; to-day,
when every creature under heaven is rejoicing, you look most deplorable
and woe-begone. You really should learn to have a little sympathy."</DD>

<DD>
The tears fell quickly down Ruth's cheeks, but she did not speak. She could
not put into words the sense she was just beginning to entertain of the
estimation in which she was henceforward to be held. She thought he would
be as much grieved as she was at what had taken place that morning; she
fancied she should sink in his opinion if she told him how others regarded
her; besides, it seemed ungenerous to dilate upon the suffering of which
he was the cause.</DD>

<DD>
"I will not," thought she, "embitter his life; I will try and be cheerful.
I must not think of myself so much. If I can but make him happy, what need
I care for chance speeches?"</DD>

<DD>
Accordingly, she made every effort possible to be as light-hearted as he
was; but, somehow, the moment she relaxed, thoughts would intrude, and
wonders would force themselves upon her mind: so that altogether she was
not the gay and bewitching companion Mr. Bellingham had previously found
her.</DD>

<DD>
They sauntered out for a walk. The path they chose led to a wood on the
side of a hill, and they entered, glad of the shade of the trees. At first
it appeared like any common grove, but they soon came to a deep descent,
on the summit of which they stood, looking down on the tree-tops, which
were softly waving far beneath their feet. There was a path leading sharp
down, and they followed it; the ledge of rock made it almost like going
down steps, and their walk grew into a bounding, and their bounding into
a run, before they reached the lowest plane. A green gloom reigned there;
it was the still hour of noon; the little birds were quiet in some leafy
shade. They went on a few yards, and then they came to a circular pool
overshadowed by the trees, whose highest boughs had been beneath their
feet a few minutes before. The pond was hardly below the surface of the
ground, and there was nothing like a bank on any side. A heron was standing
there motionless, but when he saw them he flapped his wings and slowly
rose; and soared above the green heights of the wood up into the very sky
itself, for at that depth the trees appeared to touch the round white clouds
which brooded over the earth. The speedwell grew in the shallowest water
of the pool, and all around its margin, but the flowers were hardly seen
at first, so deep was the green shadow cast by the trees. In the very middle
of the pond the sky was mirrored clear and dark, a blue which looked as
if a black void lay behind.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, there are water-lilies!" said Ruth, her eye catching on the farther
side. "I must go and get some."</DD>

<DD>
"No; I will get them for you. The ground is spongy all round there. Sit
still, Ruth; this heap of grass will make a capital seat."</DD>

<DD>
He went round, and she waited quietly for his return. When he came back
he took off her bonnet, without speaking, and began to place his flowers
in her hair. She was quite still while he arranged her coronet, looking
up in his face with loving eyes, with a peaceful composure. She knew that
he was pleased from his manner, which had the joyousness of a child playing
with a new toy, and she did not think twice of his occupation. It was pleasant
to forget everything except his pleasure. When he had decked her out, he
said--</DD>

<DD>
"There, Ruth! now you'll do. Come and look at yourself in the pond. Here,
where there are no weeds. Come."</DD>

<DD>
She obeyed, and could not help seeing her own loveliness; it gave her a
sense of satisfaction for an instant, as the sight of any other beautiful
object would have done, but she never thought of associating it with herself.
She knew that she was beautiful; but that seemed abstract, and removed
from herself. Her existence was in feeling and thinking, and loving.</DD>

<DD>
Down in that green hollow they were quite in harmony. Her beauty was all
that Mr. Bellingham cared for, and it was supreme. It was all he recognised
of her, and he was proud of it. She stood in her white dress against the
trees which grew around; her face was flushed into a brilliancy of colour
which resembled that of a rose in June; the great, heavy, white flowers
drooped on either side of her beautiful head, and if her brown hair was
a little disordered, the very disorder only seemed to add a grace. She
pleased him more by looking so lovely than by all her tender endeavours
to fall in with his varying humour.</DD>

<DD>
But when they left the wood, and Ruth had taken out her flowers, and resumed
her bonnet, as they came near the inn, the simple thought of giving him
pleasure was not enough to secure Ruth's peace. She became pensive and
sad, and could not rally into gaiety.</DD>

<DD>
"Really, Ruth," said he, that evening, "you must not encourage yourself
in this habit of falling into melancholy reveries without any cause. You
have been sighing twenty times during the last half-hour. Do be a little
cheerful. Remember, I have no companion but you in this out-of-the-way
place."</DD>

<DD>
"I am very sorry," said Ruth, her eyes filling with tears; and then she
remembered that it was very dull for him to be alone with her, heavy-hearted
as she had been all day. She said in a sweet, penitent tone--</DD>

<DD>
"Would you be so kind as to teach me one of those games at cards you were
speaking about yesterday? I would do my best to learn."</DD>

<DD>
Her soft, murmuring voice won its way. They rang for the cards, and he
soon forgot that there was such a thing as depression or gloom in the world,
in the pleasure of teaching such a beautiful ignoramus the mysteries of
card-playing.</DD>

<DD>
"There!" said he, at last, "that's enough for one lesson. Do you know,
little goose, your blunders have made me laugh myself into one of the worst
headaches I have had for years.</DD>

<DD>
He threw himself on the sofa, and in an instant she was by his side.</DD>

<DD>
"Let me put my cool hands on your forehead," she begged; "that used to
do mamma good."</DD>

<DD>
He lay still, his face away from the light, and not speaking. Presently
he fell asleep. Ruth put out the candles, and sat patiently by him for
a long time, fancying he would awaken refreshed. The room grew cold in
the night air; but Ruth dared not rouse him from what appeared to be sound,
restoring slumber. She covered him with her shawl, which she had thrown
over a chair on coming in from their twilight ramble. She had ample time
to think; but she tried to banish thought. At last, his breathing became:
quick and oppressed, and, after listening to it for some minutes with increasing
affright, Ruth ventured to awaken him. He seemed stupefied and shivery.
Ruth became more and more terrified; all the household were asleep except
one servant-girl, who was wearied out of what little English she had knowledge
of in more waking hours, and could only answer, "Iss, indeed, ma'am," to
any question put to her by Ruth.</DD>

<DD>
She sat by the bedside all night long. He moaned and tossed, but never
spoke sensibly. It was a new form of illness to the miserable Ruth. Her
yesterday's suffering went into the black distance of long-past years.
The present was all in all. When she heard people stirring, she went in
search of Mrs. Morgan, whose shrewd, sharp manners, unsoftened by inward
respect for the poor girl, had awed Ruth even when Mr. Bellingham was by
to protect her.</DD>

<DD>
"Mrs. Morgan," she said, sitting down in the little parlour appropriated
to the landlady, for she felt her strength suddenly desert her--"Mrs. Morgan,
I'm afraid Mr. Bellingham is very ill;"--here she burst into tears, but
instantly checking herself, "Oh, what must I do?" continued she; "I don't
think he has known anything all through the night, and he looks so strange
and wild this morning."</DD>

<DD>
She gazed up into Mrs. Morgan's face, as if reading an oracle.</DD>

<DD>
"Indeed, miss, ma'am, and it's a very awkward thing. But don't cry, that
can do no good; 'deed it can't. I'll go and see the poor young man myself,
and then I can judge if a doctor is wanting."</DD>

<DD>
Ruth followed Mrs. Morgan upstairs. When they entered the sick-room Mr.
Bellingham was sitting up in bed, looking wildly about him, and as he saw
them, he exclaimed--</DD>

<DD>
"Ruth! Ruth! come here; I won't be left alone!" and then he fell down exhausted
on the pillow. Mrs. Morgan went up and spoke to him, but he did not answer
or take any notice.</DD>

<DD>
"I'll send for Mr. Jones, my dear, 'deed and I will; we'll have him here
in a couple of hours, please God."</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, can't he come sooner?" asked Ruth, wild with terror.</DD>

<DD>
"'Deed no! he lives at Llanglas when he's at home, and that's seven mile
away, and he may be gone a round eight or nine mile on the other side Llanglas;
but I'll send a boy on the pony directly."</DD>

<DD>
Saying this, Mrs. Morgan left Ruth alone. There was nothing to be done,
for Mr. Bellingham had again fallen into heavy sleep. Sounds of daily life
began, bells rang, break-fast-services clattered up and down the passages,
and Ruth sat on shivering by the bedside in that darkened room. Mrs. Morgan
sent her breakfast upstairs by a chambermaid; but Ruth motioned it away
in her sick agony, and the girl had no right to urge her to partake of
it. That alone broke the monotony of the long morning. She heard the sound
of merry parties setting out on excursions, on horseback or in carriages;
and once, stiff and wearied, she stole to the window, and looked out on
one side of the blind; but the day looked bright and discordant to her
aching, anxious heart. The gloom of the darkened room was better and more
befitting.</DD>

<DD>
It was some hours after he was summoned before the doctor made his appearance.
He questioned his patient, and, receiving no coherent answer, he asked
Ruth concerning the symptoms; but when she questioned him in turn he only
shook his head and looked grave. He made a sign to Mrs. Morgan to follow
him out of the room, and they went down to her parlour, leaving Ruth in
a depth of despair, lower than she could have thought it possible there
remained for her to experience, an hour before.</DD>

<DD>
"I am afraid this is a bad case," said Mr. Jones to Mrs. Morgan in Welsh.
"A brain-fever has evidently set in."</DD>

<DD>
"Poor young gentleman! poor young man! He looked the very picture of health!"</DD>

<DD>
"That very appearance of robustness will, in all probability, make his
disorder more violent. However, we must hope for the best, Mrs. Morgan.
Who is to attend upon him? He will require careful nursing. Is that young
lady his sister? She looks too young to be his wife?"</DD>

<DD>
"No, indeed! Gentlemen like you must know, Mr. Jones, that we can't always
look too closely into the ways of young men who come to our houses. Not
but what I am sorry for her, for she's an innocent, inoffensive young creature.
I always think it right, for my own morals, to put a little scorn into
my manners when such as her come to stay here; but indeed, she's so gentle,
I've found it hard work to show the proper contempt."</DD>

<DD>
She would have gone on to her inattentive listener if she had not heard
a low tap at the door, which recalled her from her morality, and Mr. Jones
from his consideration of the necessary prescriptions.</DD>

<DD>
"Come in!" said Mrs. Morgan sharply. And Ruth came in. She was white and
trembling; but she stood in that dignity which strong feeling, kept down
by self-command, always imparts.</DD>

<DD>
"I wish you, sir, to be so kind as to tell me, clearly and distinctly,
what I must do for Mr. Bellingham. Every direction you give me shall be
most carefully attended to. You spoke about leeches--I can put them on,
and see about them. Tell me everything, sir, that you wish to have done!"</DD>

<DD>
Her manner was calm and serious, and her countenance and deportment showed
that the occasion was calling out strength sufficient to meet it. Mr. Jones
spoke with a deference which he had not thought of using upstairs, even
while he supposed her to be the sister of the invalid. Ruth listened gravely;
she repeated some of the injunctions, in order that she might be sure that
she fully comprehended them, and then, bowing, left the room.</DD>

<DD>
"She is no common person," said Mr. Jones. "Still she is too young to have
the responsibility of such a serious case. Have you any idea where his
friends live, Mrs. Morgan?"</DD>

<DD>
"Indeed and I have. His mother, as haughty a lady as you would wish to
see, came travelling through Wales last year; she stopped here, and, I
warrant you, nothing was good enough for her; she was real quality. She
left some clothes and hooks behind her (for the maid was almost as fine
as the mistress, and little thought of seeing after her lady's clothes,
having a taste for going to see scenery along with the man-servant), and
we had several letters from her. I have them locked in the drawers in the
bar, where I keep such things."</DD>

<DD>
"Well, I should recommend your writing to the lady, and telling her her
son's state."</DD>

<DD>
"It would be a favour, Mr. Jones, if you would just write it yourself.
English writing comes so strange to my pen."</DD>

<DD>
The letter was written, and, in order to save time, Mr. Jones took it to
the Llanglas post-office.</DD>
