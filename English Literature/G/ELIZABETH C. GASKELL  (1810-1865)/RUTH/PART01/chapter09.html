Mrs. Hughes bustled about with many a sympathetic exclamation, now in pretty
broken English, now in more fluent Welsh, which sounded as soft as Russian
or Italian, in her musical voice. Mr. Benson, for that was the name of
the hunchback, lay on the sofa thinking; while the tender Mrs. Hughes made
every arrangement for his relief from pain. He had lodged with her for
three successive years, and she knew and loved him.</DD>

<DD>
Ruth stood in the little bow-window, looking out. Across the moon, and
over the deep blue heavens, large, torn, irregular-shaped clouds went hurrying,
as if summoned by some storm-spirit. The work they were commanded to do
was not here; the mighty gathering-place lay eastward, immeasurable leagues;
and on they went, chasing each other over the silent earth, now black,
now silver-white at one transparent edge, now with the moon shining like
Hope through their darkest centre, now again with a silver lining; and
now, utterly black, they sailed lower in the lift, and disappeared behind
the immovable mountains; they were rushing in the very direction in which
Ruth had striven and struggled to go that afternoon; they, in their wild
career, would soon pass over the very spot where he (her world's he) was
lying sleeping, or perhaps not sleeping, perhaps thinking of her. The storm
was in her mind, and rent and tore her purposes into forms as wild and
irregular as the heavenly shapes she was looking at. If, like them, she
could pass the barrier horizon in the night, she might overtake him.</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Benson saw her look, and read it partially. He saw her longing gaze
outwards upon the free, broad world, and thought that the siren waters,
whose deadly music yet rang in his ears, were again tempting her. He called
her to him praying that his feeble voice might have power.</DD>

<DD>
"My dear young lady, I have much to say to you; and God has taken my strength
from me now when I most need--Oh, I sin to speak so--but, for His sake,
I implore you to be patient here, if only till to-morrow morning." He looked
at her, but her face was immovable, and she did not speak. She could not
give up her hope, her chance, her liberty, till to-morrow.</DD>

<DD>
"God help me," said he mournfully, "my words do not touch her;" and, still
holding her hand, he sank back on the pillows. Indeed, it was true that
his words did not vibrate in her atmosphere. The storm-spirit raged there,
and filled her heart with the thought that she was an outcast; and the
holy words, "for His sake," were answered by the demon, who held possession,
with a blasphemous defiance of the merciful God--</DD>

<DD>
"What have I to do with Thee?"</DD>

<DD>
He thought of every softening influence of religion which over his own
disciplined heart had power, but put them aside as useless. Then the still
small voice whispered, and he spake--</DD>

<DD>
"In your mother's name, whether she be dead or alive, I command you to
stay here until I am able to speak to you."</DD>

<DD>
She knelt down at the foot of the sofa, and shook it with her sobs. Her
heart was touched, and he hardly dared to speak again. At length he said--</DD>

<DD>
"I know you will not go--you could not--for her sake. You will not, will
you?"</DD>

<DD>
"No," whispered Ruth; and then there was a great blank in her heart. She
had given up her chance. She was calm, in the utter absence of all hope.</DD>

<DD>
"And now you will do what I tell you?" said he gently, but unconsciously
to himself, in the tone of one who has found the hidden spell by which
to rule spirits.</DD>

<DD>
She slowly said, "Yes." But she was subdued.</DD>

<DD>
He called Mrs. Hughes. She came from her adjoining shop.</DD>

<DD>
"You have a bedroom within yours, where your daughter used to sleep, I
think? I am sure you will oblige me, and I shall consider it as a great
favour, if you will allow this young lady to sleep there to-night. Will
you take her there now? Go, my dear. I have full trust in your promise
not to leave until I can speak to you." His voice died away to silence;
but as Ruth rose from her knees at his bidding, she looked at his face
through her tears. His lips were moving in earnest, unspoken prayer, and
she knew it was for her.</DD>

<DD>
That night, although his pain was relieved by rest, he could not sleep;
and, as in fever, the coming events kept unrolling themselves before him
in every changing and fantastic form. He met Ruth in all possible places
and ways, and addressed her in every manner he could imagine most calculated
to move and affect her to penitence and virtue. Towards morning he fell
asleep, but the same thoughts haunted his dreams; he spoke, but his voice
refused to utter aloud; and she fled, relentless, to the deep, black pool.</DD>

<DD>
But God works in His own way.</DD>

<DD>
The visions melted into deep, unconscious sleep. He was awakened by a knock
at the door, which seemed a repetition of what he had heard in his last
sleeping moments.</DD>

<DD>
It was Mrs. Hughes. She stood at the first word of permission within the
room.</DD>

<DD>
"Please, sir, I think the young lady is very ill indeed, sir; perhaps you
would please to come to her."</DD>

<DD>
"How is she ill?" said he, much alarmed.</DD>

<DD>
"Quite quiet-like, sir; but I think she is dying, that's all, indeed, sir."</DD>

<DD>
"Go away, I will be with you directly," he replied, his heart sinking within
him.</DD>

<DD>
In a very short time he was standing with Mrs. Hughes by Ruth's bedside.
She lay as still as if she were dead, her eyes shut, her wan face numbed
into a fixed anguish of expression. She did not speak when they spoke,
though after a while they thought she strove to do so. But all power of
motion and utterance had left her. She was dressed in everything, except
her bonnet, as she had been the day before; although sweet, thoughtful
Mrs. Hughes had provided her with nightgear, which lay on the little chest
of drawers that served as a dressing-table. Mr. Benson lifted up her arm
to feel her feeble, fluttering pulse; and when he let go her hand, it fell
upon the bed in a dull, heavy way, as if she were already dead.</DD>

<DD>
"You gave her some food?" said he anxiously, to Mrs. Hughes.</DD>

<DD>
"Indeed, and I offered her the best in the house, but she shook her poor
pretty head, and only asked if I would please to get her a cup of water.
I brought her some milk though; and, 'deed, I think she'd rather have had
the water; but, not to seem sour and cross, she took some milk." By this
time Mrs. Hughes was fairly crying.</DD>

<DD>
"When does the doctor come up here?"</DD>

<DD>
"Indeed, sir, and he's up nearly every day now, the inn is so full."</DD>

<DD>
"I'll go for him. And can you manage to undress her and lay her in bed?
Open the window too, and let in the air; if her feet are cold, put bottles
of hot water to them."</DD>

<DD>
It was a proof of the true love, which was the nature of both, that it
never crossed their minds to regret that this poor young creature had been
thus thrown upon their hands. On the contrary, Mrs. Hughes called it "a
blessing."</DD>

<DD>
"It blesseth him that gives, and him that takes."</DD>
