<DD>
Miss Benson had resumed every morsel of the briskness which she had rather
lost in the middle of the day; her foot was on her native stones, and a
very rough set they were, and she was near her home and among known people.
Even Mr. Benson spoke very cheerfully to Ben, and made many inquiries of
him respecting people whose names were strange to Ruth. She was cold, and
utterly weary. She took Miss Benson's offered arm, and could hardly drag
herself as far as the little quiet street in which Mr. Benson's house was
situated. The street was so quiet that their footsteps sounded like a loud
disturbance, and announced their approach as effectually as the "trumpet's
lordly blare" did the coming of Abdallah. A door flew open, and a lighted
passage stood before them. As soon as they had entered, a stout elderly
servant emerged from behind the door, her face radiant with welcome.</DD>

<DD>
"Eh, bless ye! are ye hack again? I thought I should ha' been lost without
ye."</DD>

<DD>
She gave Mr. Benson a hearty shake of the hand, and kissed Miss Benson
warmly; then, turning to Ruth, she said, in a loud whisper--</DD>

<DD>
"Who's yon?"</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Benson was silent, and walked a step onwards. Miss Benson said boldly
out--</DD>

<DD>
"The lady I named in my note, Sally--Mrs. Denbigh, a distant relation."</DD>

<DD>
"Ay, but you said hoo was a widow. Is this chit a widow?"</DD>

<DD>
"Yes, this is Mrs. Denbigh," answered Miss Benson.</DD>

<DD>
"If I'd been her mother, I'd ha' given her a lollypop instead on a husband.
Hoo looks fitter for it."</DD>

<DD>
"Hush! Sally, Sally! Look, there's your master trying to move that heavy
box." Miss Benson calculated well when she called Sally's attention to
her master; for it was believed by every one, and by Sally herself, that
his deformity was owing to a fall he had had when he was scarcely more
than a baby, and intrusted to her care--a little nurse-girl, as she then
was, not many years older than himself. For years the poor girl had cried
herself to sleep on her pallet bed, moaning over the blight her carelessness
had brought upon her darling; nor was this self-reproach diminished by
the forgiveness of the gentle mother, from whom Thurstan Benson derived
so much of his character. The way in which comfort stole into Sally's heart
was in the gradually-formed resolution that she would never leave him nor
forsake him, but serve him faithfully all her life long; and she had kept
to her word. She loved Miss Benson, but she almost worshipped the brother.
The reverence for him was in her heart, however, and did not always show
itself in her manners. But if she scolded him herself, she allowed no one
else that privilege. If Miss Benson differed from her brother, and ventured
to think his sayings or doings might have been improved, Sally came down
upon her like a thunder-clap.</DD>

<DD>
"My goodness gracious, Master Thurstan, when will you learn to leave off
meddling with other folks' business? Here, Ben! help me up with these trunks."</DD>

<DD>
The little narrow passage was cleared, and Miss Benson took Ruth into the
sitting-room. There were only two sitting-rooms on the ground-floor, one
behind the other. Out of the back room the kitchen opened, and for this
reason the back parlour was used as the family sitting-room; or else, being,
with its garden aspect, so much the pleasanter of the two, both Sally and
Miss Benson would have appropriated it for Mr. Benson's study. As it was,
the front room, which looked to the street, was his room; and many a person
coming for help--help of which giving money was the lowest kind--was admitted,
and let forth by Mr. Benson, unknown to any one else in the house. To make
amends for his having the least cheerful room on the ground-floor, he had
the garden bedroom, while his sister slept over his study. There were two
more rooms again over these, with sloping ceilings, though otherwise large
and airy. The attic looking into the garden was the spare bedroom; while
the front belonged to Sally. There was no room over the kitchen, which
was, in fact, a supplement to the house. The sitting-room was called by
the pretty, old-fashioned name of the parlour, while Mr. Benson's room
was styled the study.</DD>

<DD>
The curtains were drawn in the parlour; there was a bright fire and a clean
hearth; indeed, exquisite cleanliness seemed the very spirit of the household,
for the door which was open to the kitchen showed a delicately-white and
spotless floor, and bright glittering tins, on which the ruddy firelight
danced.</DD>

<DD>
From the place in which Ruth sat she could see all Sally's movements.;
and though she was not conscious of close or minute observation at the
time (her body being weary, and her mind full of other thoughts), yet it
was curious how faithfully that scene remained depicted on her memory in
after years. The warm light filled every corner of the kitchen, in strong
distinction to the faint illumination of the one candle in the parlour,
whose radiance was confined, and was lost in the dead folds of window-curtains,
carpet, and furniture. The square, stout, bustling figure, neat and clean
in every respect, but dressed in the peculiar, old-fashioned costume of
the county, namely, a dark-striped linsey-woolsey petticoat, made very
short, displaying sturdy legs in woollen stockings beneath; a loose kind
of jacket, called there a "bedgown," made of pink print , a snow-white
apron and cap, both of linen, and the latter made in the shape of a "mutch";--these
articles completed Sally's costume, and were painted on Ruth's memory.
Whilst Sally was busied in preparing tea, Miss Benson took off Ruth's things;
and the latter instinctively felt that Sally, in the midst of her movements,
was watching their proceedings. Occasionally she also put in a word in
the conversation, and these little sentences were uttered quite in the
tone of an equal, if not of a superior. She had dropped the more formal
"you," with which at first she had addressed Miss Benson, and thou'd her
quietly and habitually.</DD>

<DD>
All these particulars sank unconsciously into Ruth's mind, but they did
not rise to the surface, and become perceptible, for a length of time.
She was weary and much depressed. Even the very kindness that ministered
to her was overpowering. But over the dark, misty moor a little light shone--a
beacon; and on that she fixed her eyes, and struggled out of her present
deep dejection--the little child that was coming to her!</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Benson was as languid and weary as Ruth, and was silent during all
this bustle and preparation. His silence was more grateful to Ruth than
Miss Benson's many words, although she felt their kindness. After tea,
Miss Benson took her upstairs to her room. The white dimity bed, and the
walls, stained green, had something of the colouring and purity of effect
of a snowdrop; while the floor, rubbed with a mixture that turned it into
a rich dark-brown, suggested the idea of the garden-mould out of which
the snowdrop grows. As Miss Benson helped the pale Ruth to undress, her
voice became less full-toned and hurried; the hush of approaching night
subdued her into a softened, solemn kind of tenderness, and the murmured
blessing sounded like granted prayer.</DD>

<DD>
When Miss Benson came downstairs, she found her brother reading some letters
which had been received during his absence. She went and softly shut the
door of communication between the parlour and the kitchen; and then, fetching
a grey worsted stocking which she was knitting, sat down near him, her
eyes not looking at her work but flied on the fire; while the eternal rapid
click of the knitting-needles broke the silence of the room, with a sound
as monotonous and incessant as the noise of a hand-loom. She expected him
to speak, but he did not. She enjoyed an examination into, and discussion
of, her feelings; it was an interest and amusement to her, while he dreaded
and avoided all such conversation. There were times when his feelings,
which were always earnest, and sometimes morbid, burst forth, and defied
control, and overwhelmed him; when a force was upon him compelling him
to speak. But he, in general, strove to preserve his composure, from a
fear of the compelling pain of such times, and the consequent exhaustion.
His heart had been very full of Ruth all day long, and he was afraid of
his sister beginning the subject; so he read on, or seemed to do so, though
he hardly saw the letter he held before him. It was a great relief to him
when Sally threw open the middle door with a bang, which did not indicate
either calmness of mind or sweetness of temper.</DD>

<DD>
"Is yon young woman going to stay any length o' time with us?" asked she
of Miss Benson.</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Benson put his hand gently on his sister's arm, to check her from making
any reply, while he said--</DD>

<DD>
"We cannot exactly tell, Sally. She will remain until after her confinement."</DD>

<DD>
"Lord bless us and save us!--a baby in the house! Nay, then my time's come,
and I'll pack up and begone. I never could abide them things. I'd sooner
have rats in the house."</DD>

<DD>
Sally really did look alarmed.</DD>

<DD>
"Why, Sally!" said Mr. Benson, smiling, "I was not much more than a baby
when you came to take care of me."</DD>

<DD>
"Yes, you were, Master Thurstan; you were a fine bouncing lad of three
year old and better."</DD>

<DD>
Then she remembered the change she had wrought in the "fine bouncing lad,"
and her eyes filled with tears, which she was too proud to wipe away with
her apron; for, as she sometimes said to herself, "she could not abide
crying before folk."</DD>

<DD>
"Well, it's no use talking, Sally," said Miss Benson, too anxious to speak
to be any longer repressed. "We've promised to keep her, and we must do
it; you'll have none of the trouble, Sally, so don't be afraid."</DD>

<DD>
"Well, I never! as if I minded trouble! You might ha' known me better nor
that. I've scoured master's room twice over, just to make the boards look
white, though the carpet is to cover them, and now you go and cast up about
me minding my trouble. If them's the fashions you've learnt in Wales, I'm
thankful I've never been there."</DD>

<DD>
Sally looked red, indignant, and really hurt. Mr. Benson came in with his
musical voice and soft words of healing.</DD>

<DD>
"Faith knows you don't care for trouble, Sally; she is only anxious about
this poor young woman, who has no friends but ourselves. We know there
will be more trouble in consequence of her coming to stay with us; and
I think, though we never spoke about it, that in making our plans we reckoned
on your kind help, Sally, which has never failed us yet when we needed
it."</DD>

<DD>
"You've twice the sense of your sister, Master Thurstan, that you have.
Boys always has. It's truth there will be more trouble, and I shall have
my share on't, I reckon. I can face it if I'm told out and out, but I cannot
abide the way some folk. has of denying there's trouble or pain to be met;
just as if their saying there was none, would do away with it. Some folk
treats one like a babby, and I don't like it. I'm not meaning <I>you</I>,
Master Thurstan."</DD>

<DD>
"No, Sally, you need not say that. I know well enough who you moan when
you say 'some folk.' However, I admit I was wrong in speaking as if you
minded trouble, for there never was a creature minded it less. But I want
you to like Mrs. Denbigh," said Miss Benson.</DD>

<DD>
"I dare say I should, if you'd let me alone. I did na like her sitting
down in master's chair. Set her up, indeed, in an arm-chair wi' cushions!
Wenches in my day were glad enough of stools."</DD>

<DD>
"She was tired to-night," said Mr. Benson. "We are all tired; so if you
have done your work, Sally, come in to reading."</DD>

<DD>
The three quiet people knelt down side by side, and two of them prayed
earnestly for "them that had gone astray." Before ten o'clock, the household
were in bed.</DD>

<DD>
Ruth, sleepless, weary, restless with the oppression of a sorrow which
she dared not face and contemplate bravely, kept awake all the early part
of the night. Many a time did she rise, and go to the long casement window,
and looked abroad over the still and quiet town--over the grey stone walls,
and chimneys, and old high-pointed roofs--on to the far-away hilly line
of the horizon, lying calm under the bright moonshine. It was late in the
morning when she woke from her long-deferred slumbers; and when she went
downstairs, she found Mr. and Miss Benson awaiting her in the parlour.
That homely, pretty, old-fashioned little room! How bright and still and
clean it looked! The window (all the windows at the hack of the house were
casements) was open, to let in the sweet morning air, and streaming eastern
sunshine. The long jessamine sprays, with their white-scented stars, forced
themselves almost into the room. The little square garden beyond, with
grey stone walls all round, was rich and mellow in its autumnal colouring,
running from deep crimson hollyhocks up to amber and gold nasturtiums,
and all toned down by the clear and delicate air. It was so still, that
the gossamer-webs, laden with dew, did not tremble or quiver in the least;
but the sun was drawing to himself the sweet incense of many flowers, and
the parlour was scented with the odours of mignonette and stocks. Miss
Benson was arranging a bunch of China and damask roses in an old-fashioned
jar; they lay, all dewy and fresh, on the white breakfast-cloth when Ruth
entered. Mr. Benson was reading in some large folio. With gentle morning
speech they greeted her; but the quiet repose of the scene was instantly
broken by Sally popping in from the kitchen, and glancing at Ruth with
sharp reproach. She said--</DD>

<DD>
"I reckon I may bring in breakfast, now?" with a strong emphasis on the
last word.</DD>

<DD>
"I am afraid I am very late," said Ruth.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, never mind," said Mr. Benson gently. "It was our fault for not telling
you our breakfast hour. We always have prayers at half-past seven; and
for Sally's sake, we never vary from that time; for she can so arrange
her work, if she knows the hour of prayers, as to have her mind calm and
untroubled."</DD>

<DD>
"Ahem!" said Miss Benson, rather inclined to "testify" against the invariable
calmness of Sally's mind at any hour of the day; but her brother went on
as if he did not hear her.</DD>

<DD>
"But the breakfast does not signify being delayed a little; and I am sure
you were sadly tired with your long day yesterday."</DD>

<DD>
Sally came slapping in, and put down some withered, tough, dry toast, with--</DD>

<DD>
"It's not my doing if it is like leather"; but as no one appeared to hear
her, she withdrew to her kitchen, leaving Ruth's cheeks like crimson at
the annoyance she had caused.</DD>

<DD>
All day long, she had that feeling common to those who go to stay at a
fresh house among comparative strangers: a feeling of the necessity that
she should become accustomed to the new atmosphere in which she was placed,
before she could move and act freely; it was, indeed, a purer ether, a
diviner air, which she was breathing in now, than what she had been accustomed
to for long months. The gentle, blessed mother, who had made her childhood's
home holy ground, was in her very nature so far removed from any of earth's
stains and temptation, that she seemed truly one of those</DD>

<DD>
"Who ask not if Thine eye</DD>

<DD>
Be on them; who, in love and truth,</DD>

<DD>
Where no misgiving is, rely</DD>

<DD>
Upon the genial sense of youth."</DD>

<DD>
In the Bensons' house there was the same unconsciousness of individual
merit, the same absence of introspection and analysis of motive, as there
had been in her mother; but it seemed that their lives were pure and good,
not merely from a lovely and beautiful nature, but from some law, the obedience
to which was, of itself, harmonious peace, and which governed them almost
implicitly, and with as little questioning on their part, as the glorious
stars which haste not, rest not, in their eternal obedience. This household
had many failings: they were but human, and, with all their loving desire
to bring their lives into harmony with the will of God, they often erred
and fell short; but, somehow, the very errors and faults of one individual
served to call out higher excellences in another, and so they reacted upon
each other, and the result of short discords was exceeding harmony and
peace. But they had themselves no idea of the real state of things; they
did not trouble themselves with marking their progress by self-examination;
if Mr. Benson did sometimes, in hours of sick incapacity for exertion,
turn inwards, it was to cry aloud with almost morbid despair, "God be merciful
to me a sinner!" But he strove to leave his life in the hands of God, and
to forget himself.</DD>

<DD>
Ruth sat still and quiet through the long first day. She was languid and
weary from her journey; she was uncertain what help she might offer to
give in the household duties, and what she might not. And, in her languor
and in her uncertainty, it was pleasant to watch the new ways of the people
among whom she was placed. After breakfast, Mr. Benson withdrew to his
study, Miss Benson took away the cups and saucers, and leaving the kitchen-door
open, talked sometimes to Ruth, sometimes to Sally, while she washed them
up. Sally had upstairs duties to perform, for which Ruth was thankful,
as she kept receiving rather angry glances for her unpunctuality as long
as Sally remained downstairs. Miss Benson assisted in the preparation for
the early dinner, and brought some kidney-beans to shred into a basin of
bright, pure spring-water, which caught and danced in the sunbeams as she
sat near the open casement of the parlour, talking to Ruth of things and
people which as yet the latter did not understand, and could not arrange
and comprehend. She was like a child who gets a few pieces of a dissected
map, and is confused until a glimpse of the whole unity is shown him. Mr.
and Mrs. Bradshaw were the centre pieces in Ruth's map; their children,
their servants, were the accessories; and one or two other names were occasionally
mentioned. Ruth wondered and almost wearied at Miss Benson's perseverance
in talking to her about people whom she did not know; but, in truth, Miss
Benson heard the long-drawn, quivering sighs which came from the poor heavy
heart, when it was left to silence, and had leisure to review the past;
and her quick accustomed ear caught also the low mutterings of the thunder
in the distance, in the shape of Sally's soliloquies, which, like the asides
at a theatre, were intended to be heard. Suddenly, Miss Benson called Ruth
out of the room upstairs into her own bed-chamber, and then began rummaging
in little old-fashioned boxes, drawn out of an equally old-fashioned bureau,
half-desk, half-table, and wholly drawers.</DD>

<DD>
"My dear, I've been very stupid and thoughtless. Oh! I'm so glad I thought
of it before Mrs. Bradshaw came to call. Here it is!" and she pulled out
an old wedding-ring, and hurried it on Ruth's finger. Ruth hung down her
head, and reddened deep with shame; her eyes smarted with the hot tears
that filled them. Miss Benson talked on, in a nervous hurried way--</DD>

<DD>
"It was my grandmother's; it's very broad; they made them so then, to hold
a posy inside: there's one in that--</DD>

<DD>
'Thine own sweetheart</DD>

<DD>
Till death doth part,'</DD>

<DD>
I think it is. There, there! Run away, and look as if you'd always worn
it."</DD>

<DD>
Ruth went up to her room, and threw herself down on her knees by the bedside,
and cried as if her heart would break; and then, as if a light had come
down into her soul, she calmed herself and prayed--no words can tell how
humbly, and with what earnest feeling. When she came down, she was tearstained
and wretchedly pale; but even Sally looked at her with new eyes, because
of the dignity with which she was invested by an earnestness of purpose
which had her child for its object. She sat and thought, but she no longer
heaved those bitter sighs which had wrung Miss Benson's heart in the morning.
In this way the day wore on; early dinner, early tea seemed to make it
preternaturally long to Ruth; the only event was some unexplained absence
of Sally's, who had disappeared out of the house in the evening, much to
Miss Benson's surprise, and somewhat to her indignation.</DD>

<DD>
At night, after Ruth had gone up to her room, this absence was explained
to her at least. She had let down her long waving glossy hair, and was
standing absorbed in thought in the middle of the room, when she heard
a round clumping knock at her door, different from that given by the small
knuckles of delicate fingers, and in walked Sally, with a judge-like severity
of demeanour, holding in her hand two widow's caps of commonest make and
coarsest texture. Queen Eleanor herself, when she presented the bowl to
Fair Rosamond, had not a more relentless purpose stamped on her demeanour
than had Sally at this moment. She walked up to the beautiful, astonished
Ruth, where she stood in her long, soft, white dressing-gown, with all
her luxuriant brown hair hanging dishevelled down her figure, and thus
Sally spoke--</DD>

<DD>
"Missus--or miss, as the case may be--I've my doubts as to you. I'm not
going to have my master and Miss Faith put upon, or shame come near them.
Widows wears these sort o' caps, and has their hair cut off; and whether
widows wears wedding-rings or not, they shall have their hair cut off--they
shall. I'll have no half work in this house. I've lived with the family
forty-nine year come Michaelmas, and I'll not see it disgraced by any one's
fine long curls. Sit down and let me snip off your hair; and let me see
you sham decently in a widow's cap to-morrow, or I'll leave the house.
Whatten's come over Miss Faith, as used to be as mim a lady as ever was,
to be taken by such as you, I dunnot know. Here I sit down with ye, and
let me crop you.</DD>

<DD>
She laid no light hand on Ruth's shoulder; and the latter, partly intimidated
by the old servant, who had hitherto only turned her vixen lining to observation,
and partly because she was broken-spirited enough to be indifferent to
the measure proposed, quietly sat down. Sally produced the formidable pair
of scissors that always hung at her side, and began to cut in a merciless
manner. She expected some remonstrance or some opposition, and had a torrent
of words ready to flow forth at the least sign of rebellion; but Ruth was
still and silent, with meekly-bowed head, under the strange hands that
were shearing her beautiful hair into the clipped shortness of a boy's.
Long before she had finished, Sally had some slight misgivings as to the
fancied necessity of her task; but it was too late, for half the curls
were gone, and the rest must now come off. When she had done, she lifted
up Ruth's face by placing her hand under the round white chin. She gazed
into the countenance, expecting to read some anger there, though it had
not come out in words; but' she only met the large, quiet eyes, that looked
at her with sad gentleness out of their finely-hollowed orbits. Ruth's
soft, yet dignified submission, touched Sally with compunction, though
she did not choose to show the change in her feelings. She tried to hide
it indeed, by stooping to pick up the long bright tresses; and, holding
them up admiringly, and letting them drop down and float on the air (like
the pendent branches of the weeping birch) she said: "I thought we should
ha' had some crying--I did. They're pretty curls enough; you've not been
so bad to let them be cut off neither. You see, Master Thurstan is no wiser
than a babby in some things; and Miss Faith just lets him have his own
way; so it's all left to me to keep him out of scrapes. I'll wish you a
very good night. I've heard many a one say as long hair was not wholesome.
Good night."</DD>

<DD>
But in a minute she popped her head into Ruth's room once more--</DD>

<DD>
You'll put on them caps to-morrow morning. I'll make you a present on them."</DD>

<DD>
Sally had carried away the beautiful curls, and she could not find it in
her heart to throw such lovely chestnut tresses away, so she folded them
up carefully in paper, and placed them in a safe corner of her drawer.</DD>
