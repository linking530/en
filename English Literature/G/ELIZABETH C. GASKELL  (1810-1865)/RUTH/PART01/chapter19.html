The quiet days grew into weeks and months, and even years, without any
event to startle the little circle into the consciousness of the lapse
of time. One who had known them at the date of Ruth's becoming a governess
in Mr. Bradshaw's family, and had been absent until the time of which I
am now going to tell you, would have noted some changes which had imperceptibly
come over all; but he, too, would have thought, that the life which had
brought so little of turmoil and vicissitude must have been calm and tranquil,
and in accordance with the bygone activity of the town in which their existence
passed away.</DD>

<DD>
The alterations that he would have perceived were those caused by the natural
progress of time. The Benson home was brightened into vividness by the
presence of the little Leonard, now a noble boy of six, large and grand
in limb and stature, and with a face of marked beauty and intelligence.
Indeed, he might have been considered by many as too intelligent for his
years; and often the living with old and thoughtful people gave him, beyond
most children, the appearance of pondering over the mysteries which meet
the young on the threshold of life, but which fade away as advancing years
bring us more into contact with the practical and tangible--fade away and
vanish, until it seems to require the agitation of some great storm of
the soul before we can again realise spiritual things.</DD>

<DD>
But, at times, Leonard seemed oppressed and bewildered, after listening
intent, with grave and wondering eyes, to the conversation around him;
at others, the bright animal life shone forth radiant, and no three months'
kitten--no foal, suddenly tossing up its heels by the side of its sedate
dam, and careering around the pasture in pure mad enjoyment--no young creature
of any kind, could show more merriment and gladness of heart.</DD>

<DD>
"For ever in mischief," was Sally's account of him at such times; but it
was not intentional mischief; and Sally herself would have been the first
to scold any one else who had used the same words in reference to her darling.
Indeed, she was once nearly giving warning, because she thought the boy
was being ill-used. The occasion was this: Leonard had for some time shown
a strange, odd disregard of truth; he invented stories, and told them with
so grave a face, that unless there was some internal evidence of their
incorrectness (such as describing a cow with a bonnet on) he was generally
believed, and his statements, which were given with the full appearance
of relating a real occurrence, had once or twice led to awkward results.
All the three, whose hearts were pained by this apparent unconsciousness
of the difference between truth and falsehood, were unaccustomed to children,
or they would have recognised this as a stage through which most infants,
who would have lively imaginations, pass; and, accordingly, there was a
consultation in Mr. Benson's study one morning. Ruth was there, quiet,
very pale, and with compressed lips, sick at heart as she heard Miss Benson's
arguments for the necessity of whipping, in order to cure Leonard of his
story-telling. Mr. Benson looked unhappy and uncomfortable. Education was
but a series of experiments to them all, and they all had a secret dread
of spoiling the noble boy, who was the darling of their hearts. And, perhaps,
this very intensity of love begot an impatient, unnecessary anxiety, and
made them resolve on sterner measures than the parent of a large family
(where love was more spread abroad) would have dared to use. At any rate,
the vote for whipping carried the day; and even Ruth, trembling and cold,
agreed that it must be done; only she asked, in a meek, sad voice, if she
need be present (Mr. Benson was to be the executioner--the scene, the study),
and, being instantly told that she had better not, she went slowly and
languidly up to her room, and kneeling down, she closed her ears, and prayed.</DD>

<DD>
Miss Benson, having carried her point, was very sorry for the child, and
would have begged him off; but Mr. Benson had listened more to her arguments
than now to her pleadings, and, only answered, "If it is right, it shall
be done!" He went into the garden, and deliberately, almost as if he wished
to gain time, chose and cut off a little switch from the laburnum-tree.
Then he returned through the kitchen, and gravely taking the awed and wondering
little fellow by the hand, he led him silently into the study, and placing
him before him, began an admonition on the importance of truthfulness,
meaning to conclude with what he believed to be the moral of all punishment:
"As you cannot remember this of yourself, I must give you a little pain
to make you remember it. I am sorry it is necessary, and that you cannot
recollect without my doing so."</DD>

<DD>
But before he had reached this very proper and desirable conclusion, and
while he was yet working his way, his heart aching with the terrified look
of the child at the solemnly sad face and words of upbraiding, Sally burst
in--</DD>

<DD>
"And what may ye be going to do with that fine switch I saw ye gathering,
Master Thurstan?" asked she, her eyes gleaming with anger at the answer
she knew must come, if answer she had at all.</DD>

<DD>
"Go away, Sally," said Mr. Benson, annoyed at the fresh difficulty in his
path.</DD>

<DD>
"I'll not stir never a step till you give me that switch, as you've got
for some mischief, I'll be bound."</DD>

<DD>
"Sally! remember where it is said, 'He that spareth the rod, spoileth the
child,'" said Mr. Benson austerely.</DD>

<DD>
"Ay, I remember; and I remember a bit more than you want me to remember,
I reckon. It were King Solomon as spoke them words, and it were King Solomon's
son that were King Rehoboam, and no great shakes either. I can remember
what is said on him, 2 Chronicles, xii. chapter, 14th v.: 'And he'--that's
King Rehoboam, the lad that tasted the rod--'did evil, because he prepared
not his heart to seek the Lord.' I've not been reading my chapters every
night for fifty year to be caught napping by a Dissenter, neither!" said
she triumphantly. "Come along, Leonard." She stretched out her hand to
the child, thinking that she had conquered.</DD>

<DD>
But Leonard did not stir. He looked wistfully at Mr. Benson. "Come!" said
she impatiently. The boy's mouth quivered.</DD>

<DD>
"If you want to whip me, uncle, you may do it. I don't much mind."</DD>

<DD>
Put in this form, it was impossible to carry out his intentions; and so
Mr. Benson told the lad he might go--that he would speak to him another
time. Leonard went away, more subdued in spirit than if he had been whipped.
Sally lingered a moment. She stopped to add: "I think it's for them without
sin to throw stones at a poor child, and cut up good laburnum-branches
to whip him. I only do as my betters do, when I call Leonard's mother Mrs.
Denbigh."The moment she had said this she was sorry; it was an ungenerous
advantage after the enemy had acknowledged himself defeated. Mr. Benson
dropped his head upon his hands and bid his face, and sighed deeply.</DD>

<DD>
Leonard flew in search of his mother, as in search of a refuge. If he had
found her calm, he would have burst into a passion of crying after his
agitation; as it was, he came upon her kneeling and sobbing, and he stood
quite still. Then he threw his arms round her neck, and said, "Mamma! mamma!
I will be good--I make a promise; I will speak true--I make a promise."
And he kept his word.</DD>

<DD>
Miss Benson piqued herself upon being less carried away by her love for
this child than any one else in the house; she talked severely, and had
capital theories; but her severity ended in talk, and her theories would
not work. However, she read several books on education, knitting socks
for Leonard all the while; and, upon the whole, I think, the hands were
more usefully employed than the head, and the good honest heart better
than either. She looked older than when we first knew her, but it was a
ripe, kindly age that was coming over her. Her excellent practical sense,
perhaps, made her a more masculine character than her brother. He was often
so much perplexed by the problems of life, that he let the time for action
go by; but she kept him in check by her clear, pithy talk, which brought
back his wandering thoughts to the duty that lay straight before him, waiting
for action; and then he remembered that it was the faithful part to "wait
patiently upon God," and leave the ends in His hands, who alone knows why
Evil exists in this world, and why it ever hovers on either side of Good.
In this respect, Miss Benson had more faith than her brother--or so it
seemed; for quick, resolute action in the next step of Life was all she
required, while he deliberated and trembled, and often did wrong from his
very deliberation, when his first instinct would have led him right.</DD>

<DD>
But, although decided and prompt as ever, Miss Benson was grown older since
the summer afternoon when she dismounted from the coach at the foot of
the long Welsh hill that led to Llan-dhu, where her brother awaited her
to consult her about Ruth. Though her eye was as bright and straight-looking
as ever, quick and brave in its glances, her hair had become almost snowy
white; and it was on this point she consulted Sally, soon after the date
of Leonard's last untruth. The two were arranging Miss Benson's room one
morning, when, after dusting the looking-glass, she suddenly stopped in
her operation, and after a close inspection of herself, startled Sally
by this speech--</DD>

<DD>
"Sally! I'm looking a great deal older than I used to do!"</DD>

<DD>
Sally, who was busy dilating on the increased price of flour, considered
this remark of Miss Benson's as strangely irrelevant to the matter in hand,
and only noticed it by a--</DD>

<DD>
"To be sure! I suppose we all on us do. But two-and-fourpence a dozen is
too much to make us pay for it."</DD>

<DD>
Miss Benson went on with her inspection of herself, and Sally with her
economical projects.</DD>

<DD>
"Sally!" said Miss Benson, "my hair is nearly white. The last time I looked
it was only pepper-and-salt. What must I do?"</DD>

<DD>
"Do--why, what would the wench do?" asked Sally contemptuously. "Ye're
never going to be taken in, at your time of life, by hair-dyes and such
gimcracks, as can only take in young girls whose wisdom-teeth are not cut."</DD>

<DD>
"And who are not very likely to want them," said Miss Benson quietly. "No!
but you see, Sally, it's very awkward having such grey hair, and feeling
so young. Do you know, Sally, I've as great a mind for dancing, when I
hear a lively tune on the street-organs, as ever; and as great a mind to
sing when I'm happy--to sing in my old way, Sally, you know."</DD>

<DD>
"Ay, you had it from a girl," said Sally; "and many a time, when the door's
been shut, I did not know if it was you in the parlour, or a big bumble-bee
in the kitchen, as was making that drumbling noise. I heard you at it yesterday."</DD>

<DD>
"But an old woman with grey hair ought not to have a fancy for dancing
or singing," continued Miss Benson.</DD>

<DD>
"Whatten nonsense are ye talking?" said Sally, roused to indignation. "Calling
yoursel' an old woman when you're better than ten years younger than me;
and many a girl has grey hair at five-and-twenty."</DD>

<DD>
"But I'm more than five-and-twenty, Sally--I'm fifty-seven next May!"</DD>

<DD>
"More shame for ye, then, not to know better than to talk of dyeing your
hair. I cannot abide such vanities!"</DD>

<DD>
"Oh dear! Sally, when will you understand what I mean? I want to know how
I'm to keep remembering how old I am, so as to prevent myself from feeling
so young? I was quite startled just now to see my hair in the glass, for
I can generally tell if my cap is straight by feeling. I'll tell you what
I'll do--I'll cut off a piece of my grey hair, and plait it together for
a marker in my Bible!" Miss Benson expected applause for this bright idea,
but Sally only made answer--</DD>

<DD>
"You'll be taking to painting your cheeks next, now you've once thought
of dyeing your hair." So Miss Benson plaited her grey hair in silence and
quietness, Leonard holding one end of it while she wove it, and admiring
the colour and texture all the time, with a sort of implied dissatisfaction
at the auburn colour of his own curls, which was only half-comforted away
by Miss Benson's information, that, if he lived long enough, his hair would
be like hers.</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Benson, who had looked old and frail while he was yet but young, was
now stationary as to the date of his appearance. But there was something
more of nervous restlessness in his voice and ways than formerly; that
was the only change five years had brought to him. And as for Sally, she
chose to forget age and the passage of years altogether, and had as much
work in her, to use her own expression, as she had at sixteen; nor was
her appearance very explicit as to the flight of time. Fifty, sixty, or
seventy, she might be--not more than the last, not less than the first--though
her usual answer to any circuitous inquiry as to her age was now (what
it had been for many years past), "I'm feared I shall never see thirty
again."</DD>

<DD>
Then as to the house. It was not one where the sitting-rooms are refurnished
every two or three years; not now, even (since Ruth came to share their
living) a place where, as an article grew shabby or worn, a new one was
purchased. The furniture looked poor, and the carpets almost threadbare;
but there was such a dainty spirit of cleanliness abroad, such exquisite
neatness of repair, and altogether so bright and cheerful a look about
the rooms--everything so above-board--no shifts to conceal poverty under
flimsy ornament--that many a splendid drawing-room would give less pleasure
to those who could see evidences of character in inanimate things. But
whatever poverty there might be in the house, there was full luxuriance
in the little square wall-encircled garden, on two sides of which the parlour
and kitchen looked. The laburnum-tree, which when Ruth came was like a
twig stuck into the ground, was now a golden glory in spring, and a pleasant
shade in summer. The wild hop, that Mr. Benson had brought home from one
of his country rambles, and planted by the parlour-window, while Leonard
was yet a baby in his mother's arms, was now a garland over the casement,
hanging down long tendrils, that waved in the breezes, and threw pleasant
shadows and traceries, like some old Bacchanalian carving, on the parlour-walls,
at "morn or dusky eve." The yellow rose had clambered up to the window
of Mr. Benson's bedroom, and its blossom-laden branches were supported
by a jargonelle pear-tree rich in autumnal fruit.</DD>

<DD>
But, perhaps, in Ruth herself there was the greatest external change; for
of the change which had gone on in her heart, and mind, and soul, or if
there had been any, neither she nor any one around her was conscious; but
sometimes Miss Benson did say to Sally, "How very handsome Ruth is grown!"
To which Sally made ungracious answer, "Yes, she's well enough. Beauty
is deceitful, and favour a snare, and I'm thankful the Lord has spared
me from such man-traps and spring-guns." But even Sally could not help
secretly admiring Ruth. If her early brilliancy of colouring was gone,
a clear ivory skin, as smooth as satin, told of complete and perfect health,
and was as lovely, if not so striking in effect, as the banished lilies
and roses. Her hair had grown darker and deeper, in the shadow that lingered
in its masses; her eyes, even if you could have guessed that they had shed
bitter tears in their day, had a thoughtful, spiritual look about them,
that made you wonder at their depth, and look--and look again. The increase
of dignity in her face had been imparted to her form. I do not know if
she had grown taller since the birth of her child, but she looked as if
she had. And although she had lived in a very humble home, yet there was
something about either it or her, or the people amongst whom she had been
thrown during the last few years, which had so changed her, that whereas,
six or seven years ago, you would have perceived that she was not altogether
a lady by birth and education, yet now she might have been placed among
the highest in the land, and would have been taken by the most critical
judge for their equal, although ignorant of their conventional etiquette--an
ignorance which she would have acknowledged in a simple, child-like way,
being unconscious of any false shame.</DD>

<DD>
Her whole heart was in her boy. She often feared that she loved him too
much--more than God Himself--yet she could not bear to pray to have her
love for her child lessened. But she would kneel down by his little bed
at night--at the deep, still midnight--with the stars that kept watch over
Rizpah shining down upon her, and tell God what I have now told you, that
she feared she loved her child too much, yet could not, would not, love
him less; and speak to Him of her one treasure as she could speak to no
earthly friend. And so, unconsciously, her love for her child led her up
to love to God, to the All-knowing, who read her heart.</DD>

<DD>
It might be superstition--I dare say it was--but, some-how, she never lay
down to rest without saying, as she looked her last on her boy, "Thy will,
not mine, be done"; and even while she trembled and shrank with infinite
dread from sounding the depths of what that will might be, she felt as
if her treasure were more secure to waken up rosy and bright in the morning,
as one over whose slumbers God's holy angels had watched, for the very
words which she had turned away in sick terror from realising the night
before.</DD>

<DD>
Her daily absence at her duties to the Bradshaw children only ministered
to her love for Leonard. Everything does minister to love when its foundation
lies deep in a true heart, and it was with an exquisite pang of delight
that, after a moment of vague fear,</DD>

<DD>
("Oh, mercy! to myself I said,</DD>

<DD>
If Lucy should be dead!")</DD>

<DD>
she saw her child's bright face of welcome as he threw open the door every
afternoon on her return home. For it was his silently-appointed work to
listen for her knock, and rush breathless to let her in. If he were in
the garden, or upstairs among the treasures of the lumber-room, either
Miss Benson, or her brother, or Sally would fetch him to his happy little
task; no one so sacred as he to the allotted duty. And the joyous meeting
was not deadened by custom, to either mother or child.</DD>

<DD>
Ruth gave the Bradshaws the highest satisfaction, as Mr. Bradshaw often
said both to her and to the Bensons; indeed, she rather winced under his
pompous approbation. But his favourite recreation was patronising; and
when Ruth saw how quietly and meekly Mr. Benson submitted to gifts and
praise, when an honest word of affection, or a tacit, implied acknowledgment
of equality, would have been worth everything said and done, she tried
to be more meek in spirit, and to recognise the good that undoubtedly existed
in Mr. Bradshaw. He was richer and more prosperous than ever;--a keen,
far-seeing man of business, with an undisguised contempt for all who failed
in the success which he had achieved. But it was not alone those who were
less fortunate in obtaining wealth than himself that he visited with severity
of judgment; every moral error or delinquency came under his unsparing
comment. Stained by no vice himself, either in his own eyes or in that
of any human being who cared to judge him, having nicely and wisely proportioned
and adapted his means to his ends, he could afford to speak and act with
a severity which was almost sanctimonious in its ostentation of thankfulness
as to himself. Not a misfortune or a sin was brought to light but Mr. Bradshaw
could trace to its cause in some former mode of action, which he had long
ago foretold would lead to shame. If another's son turned out wild or bad,
Mr. Bradshaw had little sympathy; it might have been prevented by a stricter
rule, or more religious life at home; young Richard Bradshaw was quiet
and steady, and other fathers might have had sons like him if they had
taken the same pains to enforce obedience. Richard was an only son, and
yet Mr. Bradshaw might venture to say he had never had his own way in his
life. Mrs. Bradshaw was, he confessed (Mr. Bradshaw did not dislike confessing
his wife's errors), rather less firm than he should have liked with the
girls; and with some people, he believed, Jemima was rather headstrong;
but to his wishes she had always shown herself obedient. All children were
obedient if their parents were decided and authoritative; and every one
would turn out well, if properly managed. If they did not prove good, they
might take the consequences of their errors.</DD>

<DD>
Mrs. Bradshaw murmured faintly at her husband when his back was turned;
but if his voice was heard, or his foot-steps sounded in the distance,
she was mute, and hurried her children into the attitude or action most
pleasing to their father. Jemima, it is true, rebelled against this manner
of proceeding, which savoured to her a little of deceit; but even she had
not, as yet, overcome her awe of her father sufficiently to act independently
of him, and according to her own sense of right--or rather, I should say,
according to her own warm, passionate impulses. Before him the wilfulness
which made her dark eyes blaze out at times was hushed and still; he had
no idea of her self-tormenting, no notion of the almost southern jealousy
which seemed to belong to her brunette complexion. Jemima was not pretty;
the flatness and shortness of her face made her almost plain; yet most
people looked twice at her expressive countenance, at the eyes which flamed
or melted at every trifle, at the rich colour which came at every expressed
emotion into her usually sallow face, at the faultless teeth which made
her smile like a sunbeam. But then, again, when she thought she was not
kindly treated, when a suspicion crossed her mind, or when she was angry
with herself, her lips were tight-pressed together, her colour was wan
and almost livid, and a stormy gloom clouded her eyes as with a film. But
before her father her words were few, and he did not notice looks or tones.</DD>

<DD>
Her brother Richard had been equally silent before his father in boyhood
and early youth; but since he had gone to be a clerk in a London house,
preparatory to assuming his place as junior partner in Mr. Bradshaw's business,
he spoke more on his occasional visits at home. And very proper and highly
moral was his conversation; set sentences of goodness, which were like
the flowers that children stick in the ground, and that have not sprung
upwards from roots--deep down in the hidden life and experience of the
heart. He was as severe a judge as his father of other people's conduct,
but you felt that Mr. Bradshaw was sincere in his condemnation of all outward
error and vice, and that he would try himself by the same laws as he tried
others; somehow, Richard's words were frequently heard with a lurking distrust,
and many shook their heads over the pattern son; but then it was those
whose sons had gone astray, and been condemned, in no private or tender
manner, by Mr. Bradshaw, so it might be revenge in them. Still, Jemima
felt that all was not right; her heart sympathised in the rebellion against
his father's commands, which her brother had confessed to her in an unusual
moment of confidence, but her uneasy conscience condemned the deceit which
he had practised.</DD>

<DD>
The brother and sister were sitting alone over a blazing Christmas fire,
and Jemima held an old newspaper in her hand to shield her face from the
hot light. They were talking of family events, when, during a pause, Jemima's
eye caught the name of a great actor, who had lately given prominence and
life to a character in one of Shakespeare's plays. The criticism in the
paper was fine, and warmed Jemima's heart.</DD>

<DD>
"How I should like to see a play!" exclaimed she.</DD>

<DD>
"Should you?" said her brother listlessly.</DD>

<DD>
"Yes, to be sure! Just hear this!" and she began to read a fine passage
of criticism.</DD>

<DD>
"Those newspaper people can make an article out of anything," said he,
yawning. "I've seen the man myself, and it was all very well, but nothing
to make such a fuss about."</DD>

<DD>
"You! you seen----! Have you seen a play, Richard? Oh, why did you never
tell me before? Tell me all about it! Why did you never name seeing ----
in your letters?"</DD>

<DD>
He half smiled, contemptuously enough. "Oh! at first it strikes one rather,
but after a while one cares no more for the theatre than one does for mince-pies."</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, I wish I might go to London!" said Jemima impatiently. "I've a great
mind to ask papa to let me go to the George Smiths', and then I could see
----. I would not think him like mince-pies."</DD>

<DD>
"You must not do any such thing!" said Richard, now neither yawning nor
contemptuous. "My father would never allow you to go to the theatre; and
the George Smiths are such old fogeys--they would be sure to tell."</DD>

<DD>
"How do you go, then? Does my father give you leave?"</DD>

<DD>
"Oh! many things are right for men which are not for girls."</DD>

<DD>
Jemima sat and pondered. Richard wished he had not been so confidential.</DD>

<DD>
"You need not name it," said he, rather anxiously.</DD>

<DD>
"Name what?" said she, startled, for her thoughts had gone far afield.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, name my going once or twice to the theatre!"</DD>

<DD>
"No, I shan't name it!" said she. "No one here would care to hear it."</DD>

<DD>
But it was with some little surprise, and almost with a feeling of disgust,
that she heard Richard join with her father in condemning some one, and
add to Mr. Bradshaw's list of offences, by alleging that the young man
was a playgoer. He did not think his sister heard his words.Mary and Elizabeth
were the two girls whom Ruth had in charge; they resembled Jemima more
than their brother in character. The household rules were occasionally
a little relaxed in their favour, for</DD>

<DD>
Mary, the elder, was nearly eight years younger than Jemima, and three
intermediate children had died. They loved Ruth dearly, made a great pet
of Leonard, and had many profound secrets together, most of which related
to their wonders if Jemima and Mr. Farquhar would ever be married. They
watched their sister closely; and every day had some fresh confidence to
make to each other, confirming or discouraging to their hopes.</DD>

<DD>
Ruth rose early, and shared the household work with Sally and Miss Benson
till seven; and then she helped Leonard to dress, and had a quiet time
alone with him till prayers and breakfast. At nine she was to be at Mr.
Bradshaw's house. She sat in the room with Mary and Elizabeth during the
Latin, the writing, and arithmetic lessons, which they received from masters;
then she read, and walked with them, clinging to her as to an elder sister;
she dined with her pupils at the family lunch, and reached home by four.
That happy home--those quiet days!</DD>

<DD>
And so the peaceful days passed on into weeks, and months, and years, and
Ruth and Leonard grew and strengthened into the riper beauty of their respective
ages; while as yet no touch of decay had come on the quaint, primitive
elders of the household.</DD>
