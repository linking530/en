<DD>
In due time that evening, Mrs. Mason collected her "young ladies" for an
inspection of their appearance before proceeding to the shire-hall. Her
eager, important, hurried manner of summoning them was not unlike that
of a hen clucking her chickens together; and, to judge from the close investigation
they had to undergo, it might have been thought that their part in the
evening's performance was to be far more important than that of temporary
ladies'-maids.</DD>

<DD>
"Is that your best frock, Miss Hilton?" asked Mrs. Mason, in a half-dissatisfied
tone, turning Ruth about; for it was only her Sunday black silk, and was
somewhat worn and shabby.</DD>

<DD>
"Yes, ma'am," answered Ruth quietly.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh! indeed. Then it will do" (still the half-satisfied tone). "Dress,
young ladies, you know, is a very secondary consideration. Conduct is everything.
Still, Miss Hilton, I think you should write and ask your guardian to send
you some money for another gown. I am sorry I did not think of it before.</DD>

<DD>
"I do not think he would send any if I wrote," answered Ruth, in a low
voice. "He was angry when I wanted a shawl, when the cold weather set in."</DD>

<DD>
Mrs. Mason gave her a little push of dismissal, and Ruth fell into the
ranks by her friend, Miss Wood.</DD>

<DD>
"Never mind, Ruthie; you're prettier than any of them," said a merry, good-natured
girl, whose plainness excluded her from any of the envy of rivalry.</DD>

<DD>
"Yes; I know I am pretty," said Ruth sadly; "but I am sorry I have no better
gown, for this is very shabby. I am ashamed of it myself, and I can see
Mrs. Mason is twice as much ashamed. I wish I need not go. I did not know
we should have to think about our own dress at all, or I should not have
wished to go."</DD>

<DD>
"Never mind, Ruth," said Jenny, "you've been looked at now, and Mrs. Mason
will soon be too busy to think about you and your gown."</DD>

<DD>
"Did you hear Ruth Hilton say she knew she was pretty?" whispered one girl
to another, so loudly that Ruth caught the words.</DD>

<DD>
"I could not help knowing," answered she simply, "for many people have
told me so."</DD>

<DD>
At length these preliminaries were over, and they were walking briskly
through the frosty air; the free motion was so inspiriting that Ruth almost
danced along, and quite forgot all about shabby gowns and grumbling guardians.
The shire-hall was even more striking than she had expected. The sides
of the staircase were painted with figures that showed ghostly in the dim
light, for only their faces looked out of the dark, dingy canvas, with
a strange fixed stare of expression.</DD>

<DD>
The young milliners had to arrange their wares on tables in the ante-room,
and make all ready before they could venture to peep into the hall-room,
where the musicians were already tuning their instruments, and where one
or two charwomen (strange contrast, with their dirty, loose attire, and
their incessant chatter, to the grand echoes of the vaulted room!) were
completing the dusting of benches and chairs.</DD>

<DD>
They quitted the place as Ruth and her companions entered. They had talked
lightly and merrily in the ante-room, but now their voices were hushed,
awed by the old magnificence of the vast apartment. It was so large that
objects showed dim at the further end, as through a mist. Full-length figures
of county worthies hung around, in all varieties of costume, from the days
of Holbein to the present time. The lofty roof was indistinct, for the
lamps were not fully lighted yet; while through the richly-painted Gothic
window at one end the moonbeams fell, many-tinted, on the floor, and mocked
with their vividness the struggles of the artificial light to illuminate
its little sphere.</DD>

<DD>
High above sounded the musicians, fitfully trying some strain of which
they were not certain. Then they stopped playing, and talked, and their
voices sounded goblin-like in their dark recess, where candles were carried
about in an uncertain wavering manner, reminding Ruth of the flickering
zig-zag motion of the will-o'-the-wisp.</DD>

<DD>
Suddenly the room sprang into the full blaze of light, and Ruth felt less
impressed with its appearance, and more willing to obey Mrs. Mason's sharp
summons to her wandering flock, than she had been when it was dim and mysterious.
They had presently enough to do in rendering offices of assistance to the
ladies who thronged in, and whose voices drowned all the muffled sound
of the band Ruth had longed so much to hear. Still, if one pleasure was
less, another was greater than she had anticipated.</DD>

<DD>
"On condition" of such a number of little observances that Ruth thought
Mrs. Mason would never have ended enumerating them, they were allowed during
the dances to stand at a side-door and watch. And what a beautiful sight
it was! Floating away to that bounding music--now far away, like garlands
of fairies, now near, and showing as lovely women, with every ornament
of graceful dress--the <I>elite</I> of the county danced on, little caring
whose eyes gazed and were dazzled. Outside all was cold, and colourless,
and uniform,--one coating of snow over all. But inside it was warm, and
glowing, and vivid; flowers scented the air, and wreathed the head, and
rested on the bosom, as if it were midsummer. Bright colours flashed on
the eye and were gone, and succeeded by others as lovely in the rapid movement
of the dance. Smiles dimpled every face, and low tones of happiness murmured
indistinctly through the room in every pause of the music.</DD>

<DD>
Ruth did not care to separate figures that formed a joyous and brilliant
whole; it was enough to gaze, and dream of the happy smoothness of the
lives in which such music, and such profusion of flowers, of jewels, elegance
of every description, and beauty of all shapes and hues, were everyday
things. She did not want to know who the people were; although to hear
a catalogue of names seemed to be the great delight of most of her companions.</DD>

<DD>
In fact, the enumeration rather disturbed her; and, to avoid the shock
of too rapid a descent into the commonplace world of Miss Smiths and Mr.
Thomsons, she returned to her post in the ante-room. There she stood, thinking
or dreaming. She was startled back to actual life by a voice close to her.
One of the dancing young ladies had met with a misfortune. Her dress, of
some gossamer material, had been looped up by nosegays of flowers, and
one of these had fallen off in the dance, leaving her gown to trail. To
repair this, she had begged her partner to bring her to the room where
the assistants should have been. None were there but Ruth.</DD>

<DD>
"Shall I leave you?" asked the gentleman. "Is my absence necessary?"</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, no!" replied the lady; "a few stitches will set all to rights. Besides,
I dare not enter that room by myself." So far she spoke sweetly and prettily.
But now she addressed Ruth. "Make haste--don't keep me an hour!" And her
voice became cold and authoritative.</DD>

<DD>
She was very pretty, with long dark ringlets and sparkling black eyes.
These had struck Ruth in the hasty glance she had taken, before she knelt
down to her task. She also saw that the gentleman was young and elegant.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, that lovely galop! how I long to dance to it! Will it never be done?
What a frightful time you are taking; and I'm dying to return in time for
this galop!"</DD>

<DD>
By way of showing a pretty, childlike impatience, she began to beat time
with her feet to the spirited air the band was playing. Ruth could not
darn the rent in her dress with this continual motion, and she looked up
to remonstrate. As she threw her head back for this purpose, she caught
the eye of the gentleman who was standing by; it was so expressive of amusement
at the airs and graces of his pretty partner, that Ruth was infected by
the feeling, and had to bend her face down to conceal the smile that mantled
there. But not before he had seen it; and not before his attention had
been thereby drawn to consider the kneeling figure, that, habited in black
up to the throat, with the noble head bent down to the occupation in which
she was engaged, formed such a contrast to the flippant, bright, artificial
girl, who sat to be served with an air as haughty as a queen on her throne.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, Mr. Bellingham! I'm ashamed to detain you so long. I had no idea any
one could have spent So much time over a little tear No wonder Mrs. Mason
charges so much for dressmaking, if her workwomen are so slow."</DD>

<DD>
It was meant to be witty, but Mr. Bellingham looked grave. He saw the scarlet
colour of annoyance flush to that beautiful cheek, which was partially
presented to him. He took a candle from the table, and held it so that
Ruth had more light. She did not look up to thank him, for she felt ashamed
that he should have seen the smile which she had caught from him.</DD>

<DD>
"I am sorry I have been so long, ma'am," said she gently, as she finished
her work; "I was afraid it might tear out again if I did not do it carefully."
She rose.</DD>

<DD>
"I would rather have had it torn than have missed that charming galop,"
said the young lady, shaking out her dress as a bird shakes its plumage.
"Shall we go, Mr. Bellingham?" looking up at him.</DD>

<DD>
He was surprised that she gave no word or sign of thanks to the assistant.
He took up a camellia that some one had left on the table.</DD>

<DD>
"Allow me, Miss Duncombe, to give this, in your name, to this young lady,
as thanks for her dexterous help."</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, of course," said she.</DD>

<DD>
Ruth received the flower silently, but with a grave, modest motion of her
head. They had gone, and she was once more alone. Presently her companions
returned.</DD>

<DD>
"What was the matter with Miss Duncombe? Did she come here?" asked they.</DD>

<DD>
"Only her lace dress was torn, and I mended it," answered Ruth quickly.</DD>

<DD>
"Did Mr. Bellingham come with her?--they say he's going to be married to
her. Did he come, Ruth?"</DD>

<DD>
"Yes," said Ruth, and relapsed into silence.</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Bellingham danced on gaily and merrily through the night, and fitted
with Miss Duncombe as he thought good. But he looked often to the side-door
where the milliner's apprentices stood; and once he recognised the tall,
slight figure, and the rich auburn hair of the girl in black; and then
his eye sought for the camellia. It was there, snowy white in her bosom.
And he danced on more gaily than ever.</DD>

<DD>
The cold grey dawn was drearily lighting up the streets when Mrs. Mason
and her company returned home. The lamps were extinguished, yet the shutters
of the shops and dwelling-houses were not opened. All sounds had an echo
unheard by day. One or two houseless beggars sat on doorsteps, and shivering,
slept with heads bowed on their knees, or resting against the cold hard
support afforded by the wall.</DD>

<DD>
Ruth felt as if a dream had melted away, and she were once more in the
actual world. How long it would be, even in the most favourable chance,
before she should again enter the shire-hall, or hear a band of music,
or even see again those bright, happy people--as much without any semblance
of care or woe as if they belonged to another race of beings! Had they
ever to deny themselves a wish, much less a want? Literally and figuratively
their lives seemed to wander through flowery pleasure-paths. Here was cold,
biting, mid-winter for her, and such as her--for those poor beggars almost
a season of death; but to Miss Duncombe and her companions, a happy, merry
time--when flowers still bloomed, and fires crackled, and comforts and
luxuries were piled around them like fairy gifts. What did they know of
the meaning of the word, so terrific to the poor? What was winter to them?
But Ruth fancied that Mr. Bellingham looked as if he could understand the
feelings of those removed from him by circumstance and station. He had
drawn up the windows of his carriage, it is true, with a shudder.</DD>

<DD>
Ruth, then, had been watching him.</DD>

<DD>
Yet she had no idea that any association made her camellia precious to
her. She believed it was solely on account of its exquisite beauty that
she tended it so carefully. She told Jenny every particular of its presentation,
with open, straight-looking eye, and without the deepening of a shade of
colour.</DD>

<DD>
"Was it not kind of him? You can't think how nicely he did it, just when
I was a little bit mortified by her ungracious ways."</DD>

<DD>
"It was very nice, indeed," replied Jenny. "Such a beautiful flower! I
wish it had some scent."</DD>

<DD>
"I wish it to be exactly as it is--it is perfect. So pure!" said Ruth,
almost clasping her treasure as she placed it in water. "Who is Mr. Bellingham?"</DD>

<DD>
"He is son to that Mrs. Bellingham of the Priory, for whom we made the
grey satin pelisse," answered Jenny sleepily.</DD>

<DD>
"That was before my time," said Ruth. But there was no answer. Jenny was
asleep.</DD>

<DD>
It was long before Ruth followed her example. Even on a winter day, it
was clear morning light that fell upon her face as she smiled in her slumber.
Jenny would not waken her, but watched her face with admiration; it was
So lovely in its happiness.</DD>

<DD>
"She is dreaming of last night," thought Jenny.</DD>

<DD>
It was true she was; but one figure flitted more than all the rest through
her visions. He presented flower after flower to her in that baseless morning
dream, which was all too quickly ended. The night before she had seen her
dead mother in her sleep, and she wakened weeping. And now she dreamed
of Mr. Bellingham, and smiled.</DD>

<DD>
And yet, was this a more evil dream than the other?</DD>

<DD>
The realities of life seemed to cut more sharply against her heart than
usual that morning. The late hours of the preceding nights, and perhaps
the excitement of the evening before, had indisposed her to bear calmly
the rubs and crosses which beset all Mrs. Mason's young ladies at times.</DD>

<DD>
For Mrs. Mason, though the first dressmaker in the county, was human after
all; and suffered, like her apprentices, from the same causes that affected
them. This morning she was disposed to find fault with everything, and
everybody. She seemed to have risen with the determination of putting the
world and all that it contained (her world, at least) to rights before
night; and abuses and negligences, which had long passed unreproved, or
winked at, were to-day to be dragged to light, and sharply reprimanded.
Nothing less than perfection would satisfy Mrs. Mason at such times.</DD>

<DD>
She had her ideas of justice, too; but they were not divinely beautiful
and true ideas; they were something more resembling a grocer's or tea-dealer's
ideas of equal right. A little over-indulgence last night was to be balanced
by a good deal of over-severity to-day; and this manner of rectifying previous
errors fully satisfied her conscience.</DD>

<DD>
Ruth was not inclined for, or capable of, much extra exertion; and it would
have tasked all her powers to have pleased her superior. The work-room
seemed filled with sharp calls. "Miss Hilton! where have you put the blue
Persian? Whenever things are mislaid, I know it has been Miss Hilton's
evening for siding away!"</DD>

<DD>
"Miss Hilton was going out last night, so I offered to ear the work-room
for her. I will find it directly, ma'am," answered one of the girls.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, I am well aware of Miss Hilton's custom of shuffling off her duties
upon any one who can be induced to relieve her," replied Mrs. Mason.</DD>

<DD>
Ruth reddened, and tears sprang to her eyes; but she was so conscious of
the falsity of the accusation, that she rebuked herself for being moved
by it, and, raising her head, gave a proud look round, as if in appeal
to her companions.</DD>

<DD>
"Where is the skirt of Lady Farnham's dress? The flounces not put on! I
am surprised! May I ask to whom this work was entrusted yesterday?" inquired
Mrs. Mason, fixing her eyes on Ruth.</DD>

<DD>
"I was to have done it, but I made a mistake, and had to undo it. I am
very sorry."</DD>

<DD>
"I might have guessed, certainly. There is little difficulty, to be sure,
in discovering, when work has been neglected or spoilt, into whose hands
it has fallen."</DD>

<DD>
Such were the speeches which fell to Ruth's share on this day of all days,
when she was least fitted to bear them with equanimity.</DD>

<DD>
In the afternoon it was necessary for Mrs Mason to go a few miles into
the country. She left injunctions, and orders, and directions, and prohibitions
without end; but at last she was gone, and, in the relief of her absence,
Ruth laid her arms on the table, and, burying her head, began to cry aloud,
with weak, unchecked sobs.</DD>

<DD>
"Don't cry, Miss Hilton,"--"Ruthie, never mind the old dragon,"--"How will
you bear on for five years, if you don't spirit yourself up not to care
a straw for what she says?"--were some of the modes of comfort and sympathy
administered by the young workwomen.</DD>

<DD>
Jenny, with a wiser insight into the grievance and its remedy, said--</DD>

<DD>
"Suppose Ruth goes. out instead of you, Fanny Barton, to do the errands.
The fresh air will do her good; and you know you dislike the cold east
winds, while Ruth says she enjoys frost and snow, and all kinds of shivery
weather."</DD>

<DD>
Fanny Barton was a great sleepy-looking girl, huddling over the fire. No
one so willing as she to relinquish the walk on this bleak afternoon, when
the east wind blew keenly down the street, drying up the very snow itself.
There was no temptation to come abroad, for those who were not absolutely
obliged to leave their warm rooms; indeed, the dusk hour showed that it
was the usual tea-time for the humble inhabitants of that part of the town
through which Ruth had to pass on her shopping expedition. As she came
to the high ground just above the river, where the street sloped rapidly
down to the bridge, she saw the fiat country beyond all covered with snow,
making the black dome of the cloud-laden sky appear yet blacker; as if
the winter's night had never fairly gone away, but had hovered on the edge
of the world all through the short bleak day. Down by the bridge (where
there was a little shelving bank, used as a landing-place for any pleasure-boats
that could float on that shallow stream) some children were playing, and
defying the cold; one of them had got a large washing-tub, and with the
use of a broken oar kept steering and pushing himself hither and thither
in the little creek, much to the admiration of his companions, who stood
gravely looking on, immovable in their attentive observation of the hero,
although their faces were blue with cold, and their hands crammed deep
into their pockets with some faint hope of finding warmth there. Perhaps
they feared that, if they unpacked themselves from their lumpy attitudes
and began to move about, the cruel wind would find its way into every cranny
of their tattered dress. They were all huddled up, and still; with eyes
intent on the embryo sailor. At last, one little man, envious of the reputation
that his playfellow was acquiring by his daring, called out--</DD>

<DD>
"I'll set thee a craddy, Tom! Thou dar'n't go over yon black line in the
water, out into the real river."</DD>

<DD>
Of course the challenge was not to be refused; and Tom paddled away towards
the dark line, beyond which the river swept with smooth, steady current.
Ruth (a child in years herself) stood at the top of the declivity watching
the adventurer, but as unconscious of any danger as the group of children
below. At their playfellow's success, they broke through the calm gravity
of observation into boisterous marks of applause, clapping their hands,
and stamping their impatient little feet, and shouting, "Well done, Tom;
thou hast done it rarely!"</DD>

<DD>
Tom stood in childish dignity for a moment, facing his admirers; then,
in an instant, his washing-tub boat was whirled round, and he lost his
balance, and fell out; and both he and his beat were carried away slowly,
but surely, by the strong full river which eternally moved onwards to the
sea.</DD>

<DD>
The children shrieked aloud with terror; and Ruth flew down to the little
bay, and far into its shallow waters, before she felt how useless such
an action was, and that the sensible plan would have been to seek for efficient
help. Hardly had this thought struck her, when, louder and sharper than
the sullen roar of the stream that was ceaselessly and unrelentingly flowing
on, came the splash of a horse galloping through the water in which she
was standing. Past her like lightning--down in the stream, swimming along
with the current--a stooping rider--an outstretched grasping arm--a little
life redeemed, and a child saved to those who loved it! Ruth stood dizzy
and sick with emotion while all this took place; and when the rider turned
the swimming horse, and slowly breasted up the river to the landing-place,
she recognised him as the Mr. Bellingham of the night before. He carried
the unconscious child across his horse, the body hung in so lifeless a
manner that Ruth believed it was dead; and her eyes were suddenly blinded
with tears. She waded back to the beach, to the point towards which Mr.
Bellingham was directing his horse.</DD>

<DD>
"Is he dead?" asked she, stretching out her arms to receive the little
fellow; for she instinctively felt that the position in which he hung was
not the most conducive to returning consciousness, if indeed it would ever
return.</DD>

<DD>
"I think not," answered Mr. Bellingham, as he gave the child to her, before
springing off his horse. "Is he your brother? Do you know who he is?"</DD>

<DD>
"Look!" said Ruth, who had sat down upon the ground, the better to prop
the poor lad, "his hand twitches! he lives; oh, sir, he lives! Whose boy
is he?" (to the people, who came hurrying and gathering to the spot at
the rumourof an accident).</DD>

<DD>
"He's old Nelly Brownson's," said they. "Her grandson."</DD>

<DD>
"We must take him into a house directly," said she. "Is his home far off?"</DD>

<DD>
"No, no; it's just close by."</DD>

<DD>
"One of you go for a doctor at once," said Mr. Bellingham authoritatively,
"and bring him to the old woman's without delay. You must not hold him
any longer," he continued, speaking to Ruth, and remembering her face now
for the first time; "your dress is dripping wet already. Here! you fellow,
take him up, d'ye see!"</DD>

<DD>
But the child's hand had nervously clenched Ruth's dress, and she would
not have him disturbed. She carried her heavy burden very tenderly towards
a mean little cottage indicated by the neighhours; an old crippled woman
was coming out of the door, shaking all over with agitation.</DD>

<DD>
"Dear heart!" said she, "he's the last of 'em all, and he's gone afore
me."</DD>

<DD>
"Nonsense," said Mr. Bellingham, "the boy is alive, and likely to live."</DD>

<DD>
But the old woman was helpless and hopeless, and insisted on believing
that her grandson was dead; and dead he would have been if it had not been
for Ruth, and one or two of the more sensible neighbours, who, under Mr.
Bellingham's directions, bustled about, and did all that was necessary
until animation was restored.</DD>

<DD>
"What a confounded time those people are in fetching the doctor!" said
Mr. Bellingham to Ruth, between whom and himself a sort of silent understanding
had sprung up from the circumstance of their having been the only two (besides
mere children) who had witnessed the accident, and also the only two to
whom a certain degree of cultivation had given the power of understanding
each other's thoughts and even each other's words.</DD>

<DD>
"It takes so much to knock an idea into such stupid people's heads. They
stood gaping and asking which doctor they were to go for, as if it signified
whether it was Brown or Smith, so long as he had his wits about him. I
have no more time to waste here, either; I was on the gallop when I caught
sight of the lad; and, now he has fairly sobbed and opened his eyes, I
see no use in my staying in this stifling atmosphere. May I trouble you
with one thing? Will you be so good as to see that the little fellow has
all that he wants? If you'll allow me, I'll leave you my purse," continued
he, giving it to Ruth, who was only too glad to have this power entrusted
to her of procuring one or two requisites which she had perceived to be
wanted. But she saw some gold between the network; she did not like the
charge of such riches.</DD>

<DD>
"I shall not want so much, really, sir. One sovereign will be plenty--more
than enough. May I take that out, and I will give you back what is left
of it when I see you again? or, perhaps, I had better send it to you, sir.</DD>

<DD>
"I think you had better keep it all at present. Oh, what a horrid dirty
place this is insufferable two minutes longer. You must not stay here;
you'll be poisoned with this abominable air. Come towards the door, I beg.
Well, if you think one sovereign will he enough, I will take my purse;
only, remember you apply to me if you think they want more."</DD>

<DD>
They were standing at the door, where some one was holding Mr. Bellingham's
horse. Ruth was looking at him with her earnest eyes (Mrs. Mason and her
errands quite forgotten in the interest of the afternoon's event), her
whole thoughts bent upon rightly understanding and following out his wishes
for the little boy's welfare; and until now this had been the first object
in his own mind. But at this moment the strong perception of Ruth's exceeding
beauty came again upon him. He almost lost the sense of what he was saying,
he was so startled with admiration. The night before, he had not seen her
eyes; and now they looked straight and innocently full at him, grave, earnest,
and deep. But when she instinctively read the change in the expression
of his countenance, she dropped her large white veiling lids; and he thought
her face was lovelier still.</DD>

<DD>
The irresistible impulse seized him to arrange matters, so that he might
see her again before long.</DD>

<DD>
"No!" said he. "I see it would he better that you should keep the purse.
Many things may be wanted for the lad which we cannot calculate upon now.
If I remember rightly, there are three sovereigns and some loose change;
I shall, perhaps, see you again in a few days, when, if there he any money
left in the purse, you can restore it to me."</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, yes, sir," said Ruth, alive to the magnitude of the wants to which
she might have to administer, and yet rather afraid of the responsibility
implied in the possession of so much money.</DD>

<DD>
"Is there any chance of my meeting you again in this house?" asked he.</DD>

<DD>
"I hope to come whenever I can, sir; but I must run in errand-times, and
I don't know when my turn may be."</DD>

<DD>
"Oh"--he did not fully understand this answer--"I should like to know how
you think the boy is going on, if it is not giving you too much trouble;
do you ever take walks?"</DD>

<DD>
"Not for walking's sake, sir."</DD>

<DD>
"Well," said he, "you go to church, I suppose? Mrs. Mason does not keep
you at work on Sundays; I trust?"</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, no, sir. I go to church regularly."</DD>

<DD>
"Then, perhaps, you will be so good as to tell me what church you go to,
and I will meet you there next Sunday afternoon?"</DD>

<DD>
"I go to St. Nicholas', sir. I will take care and bring you word how the
boy is, and what doctor they get; and I will keep an account of the money
I spend."</DD>

<DD>
"Very well, thank you. Remember, I trust to you."</DD>

<DD>
He meant that he relied on her promise to meet him; but Ruth thought that
he was referring to the responsibility of doing the best she could for
the child. He was going away, when a fresh thought struck him, and he turned
back into the cottage once more, and addressed Ruth, with a half smile
on his countenance----</DD>

<DD>
"It seems rather strange, but we have no one to introduce us; my name is
Bellingham--yours is"--</DD>

<DD>
"Ruth Hilton, sir," she answered, in a low voice, for, now that the conversation
no longer related to the boy, she felt shy and restrained.</DD>

<DD>
He held out his hand to shake hers; and, just as she gave it to him, the
old grandmother came tottering up to ask some question. The interruption
jarred upon him, and made him once more keenly alive to the closeness of
the air, and the squalor and dirt by which he was surrounded.</DD>

<DD>
"My good woman," said he to Nelly Brownson, "could you not keep your place
a little neater and cleaner? It is more fit for pigs than human beings.
The air in this room is quite offensive, and the dirt and filth is really
disgraceful."</DD>

<DD>
By this time he was mounted, and, bowing to Ruth, he rode away.</DD>

<DD>
Then the old woman's wrath broke out.</DD>

<DD>
"Who may you be, that knows no better manners than to come into a poor
woman's house to abuse it?--fit for pigs, indeed! What d'ye call yon fellow?"</DD>

<DD>
"He is Mr. Bellingham," said Ruth, shocked at the old woman's apparent
ingratitude. "It was he that rode into the water to save your grandson.
He would have been drowned but for Mr. Bellingham. I thought once they
would both have been swept away by the current, it was so strong."</DD>

<DD>
"The river is none so deep, either," the old woman said, anxious to diminish
as much as possible the obligation she was under to one who had offended
her. "Some one else would have saved him, if this fine young spark had
never been here. He's an orphan, and God watches over orphans, they say.
I'd rather it had been any one else as had picked him out, than one who
comes into a poor body's house only to abuse it."</DD>

<DD>
"He did not come in only to abuse it," said Ruth gently. "He came with
little Tom; he only said it was not quite so clean as it might be."</DD>

<DD>
"What! you're taking up the cry, are you? Wait till you are an old woman
like me, crippled with rheumatiz, and a lad to see after like Tom, who
is always in mud when he isn't in water; and his food and mine to scrape
together (God knows we're often short, and do the best I can), and water
to fetch up that steep brow.</DD>

<DD>
She stopped to cough; and Ruth judiciously changed the subject, and began
to consult the old woman as to the wants of her grandson, in which consultation
they were soon assisted by the medical man.</DD>

<DD>
When Ruth had made one or two arrangements with a neighbour whom she asked
to procure the most necessary things, and had heard from the doctor that
all would be right in a day or two, she began to quake at the recollection
of the length of time she had spent at Nelly Brownson's, and to remember,
with some affright, the strict watch kept by Mrs. Mason over her apprentices'
out-goings and in-comings on working-days. She hurried off to the shops,
and tried to recall her wandering thoughts to the respective merits of
pink and blue as a match to lilac, found she had lost her patterns, and
went home with ill-chosen things, and in a fit of despair at her own stupidity.</DD>

<DD>
The truth was, that the afternoon's adventure filled her mind; only the
figure of Tom (who was now safe and likely to do well) was receding into
the background, and that of Mr. Bellingham becoming more prominent than
it had been. His spirited and natural action of galloping into the water
to save the child, was magnified by Ruth into the most heroic deed of daring;
his interest about the boy was tender, thoughtful benevolence in her eyes,
and his careless liberality of money was fine generosity; for she forgot
that generosity implies some degree of self-denial. She was gratified,
too, by the power of dispensing comfort he had entrusted to her, and was
busy with Alnaschar visions of wise expenditure, when the necessity of
opening Mrs. Mason's house-door summoned her back into actual present life,
and the dread of an immediate scolding.</DD>

<DD>
For this time, however, she was spared; but spared for such a reason that
she would have been thankful for some blame in preference to her impunity.
During her absence, Jenny's difficulty of breathing had suddenly become
worse, and the girls had, on their own responsibility, put her to bed,
and were standing round her in dismay, when Mrs. Mason's return home (only
a few minutes before Ruth arrived) fluttered them back into the workroom.</DD>

<DD>
And now all was confusion and hurry; a doctor to be sent for; a mind to
be unburdened of directions for a dress to a forewoman, who was too ill
to understand; scoldings to be scattered with no illiberal hand amongst
a group of frightened girls, hardly sparing the poor invalid herself for
her inopportune illness. In the middle of all this turmoil Ruth crept quietly
to her place, with a heavy saddened heart at the indisposition of the gentle
forewoman. She would gladly have nursed Jenny herself, and often longed
to do it, but she could not be spared. Hands, unskilful in fine and delicate
work, would be well enough qualified to tend the sick, until the mother
arrived from home. Meanwhile, extra diligence was required in the workroom;
and Ruth found no opportunity of going to see little Tom, or to fulfil
the plans for making him and his grandmother more comfortable, which she
had proposed to herself. She regretted her rash promise to Mr. Bellingham,
of attending to the little boy's welfare; all that she could do was done
by means of Mrs. Mason's servant, through whom she made inquiries, and
sent the necessary help.</DD>

<DD>
The subject of Jenny's illness was the prominent one in the house. Ruth
told of her own adventure, to be sure; but, when she was at the very crisis
of the boy's fall into the river, the more fresh and vivid interest of
some tidings of Jenny was brought into the room, and Ruth ceased, almost
blaming herself for caring for anything besides the question of life or
death to be decided in that very house.</DD>

<DD>
Then a pale, gentle-looking woman was seen moving softly about; and it
was whispered that this was the mother come to nurse her child. Everybody
liked her, she was so sweet-looking, and gave so little trouble, and seemed
so patient, and so thankful, for any inquiries about her daughter, whose
illness it was understood, although its severity was mitigated, was likely
to be long and tedious. While all the feelings and thoughts relating to
Jenny were predominant, Sunday arrived. Mrs. Mason went the accustomed
visit to her father's, making some little show of apology to Mrs. Wood
for leaving her and her daughter; the apprentices dispersed to the various
friends with whom they were in the habit of spending the day; and Ruth
went to St. Nicholas', with a sorrowful heart, depressed on account of
Jenny, and self-reproachful at having rashly undertaken what she had been
unable to perform.</DD>

<DD>
As she came out of church she was joined by Mr. Bellingham. She had half
hoped that he might have forgotten the arrangement, and yet she wished
to relieve herself of her responsibility. She knew his step behind her,
and the contending feelings made her heart beat hard, and she longed to
run away.</DD>

<DD>
"Miss Hilton, I believe," said he, overtaking her, and bowing forward,
so as to catch a sight of her rose-red face. "How is our little sailor
going on? Well, I trust, from the symptoms the other day."</DD>

<DD>
"I believe, sir, he is quite well now. I am very sorry, but I have not
been able to go and see him. I am so sorry--I could not help it. But I
have got one or two things through another person. I have put them down
on this slip of paper; and here is your purse, sir, for I am afraid I can
do nothing more for him. We have illness in the house, and it makes us
very busy."</DD>

<DD>
Ruth had been so much accustomed to blame of late, that she almost anticipated
some remonstrance or reproach now, for not having fulfilled her promise
better. She little guessed that Mr. Bellingham was far more busy trying
to devise some excuse for meeting her again, during the silence that succeeded
her speech, than displeased with her for not bringing a more particular
account of the little boy, in whom he had ceased to feel any interest.</DD>

<DD>
She repeated, after a minute's pause--</DD>

<DD>
"I am very sorry I have done so little, sir."</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, yes, I am sure you have done all you could. It was thoughtless in
me to add to your engagements."</DD>

<DD>
"He is displeased with me," thought Ruth, "for what he believes to have
been neglect of the boy, whose life he risked his own to save. If I told
all, he would see that I could not do more; but I cannot tell him all the
sorrows and worries that have taken up my time."</DD>

<DD>
"And yet I am tempted to give you another little commission, if it is not
taking up too much of your time, and presuming too much on your good nature,"
said he, a bright idea having just struck him. "Mrs. Mason lives in Heneage
Place, does not she? My mother's ancestors lived there; and once, when
the house was being repaired, she took me in to show me the old place.
There was an old hunting-piece painted on a panel over one of the chimney-pieces;
the figures were portraits of my ancestors. I have often thought I should
like to purchase it, if it still remained there. Can you ascertain this
for me, and bring me word next Sunday?"</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, yes, sir," said Ruth, glad that this commission was completely within
her power to execute, and anxious to make up for her previous seeming neglect.
"I'll look directly I get home, and ask Mrs. Mason to write and let you
know."</DD>

<DD>
"Thank you," said he, only half satisfied; "I think, perhaps, however,
it might be as well not to trouble Mrs. Mason about it you see it would
compromise me, and I am not quite determined to purchase the picture; if
you would ascertain whether the painting is there, and tell me, I would
take a little time to reflect, and afterwards I could apply to Mrs. Mason
myself."</DD>

<DD>
"Very well, sir; I will see about it." So they parted.</DD>

<DD>
Before the next Sunday Mrs. Wood had taken her daughter to her distant
home, to recruit in that quiet place. Ruth watched her down the street
from an upper window, and, sighing deep and long, returned to the workroom,
whence the warning voice and gentle wisdom had departed.</DD>
