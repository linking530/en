You have now seen the note which was delivered into Mr. Benson's hands,
as the cool shades of evening stole over the glowing summer sky. When he
had read it, he again prepared to write a few hasty lines before the post
went out. The post-boy was even now sounding his horn through the village
as a signal for letters to be ready; and it was well that Mr. Benson, in
his long morning's meditation, had decided upon the course to be pursued,
in case of such an answer as that which he had received from Mrs. Bellingham.
His present note was as follows;--</DD>

<DD>
"DEAR FAITH,--You must come to this place directly, where I earnestly desire
you and your advice. I am well myself, so do not be alarmed. I have no
time for explanation, but I am sure you will not refuse me; let me trust
that I shall see you on Saturday at the latest. You know the mode by which
I came; it is the best both for expedition and cheapness. Dear Faith, do
not fail me.--</DD>

<CENTER>
<DD>
Your affectionate brother.</DD></CENTER>

<CENTER>THURSTAN BENSON.</CENTER>

<DD>
"P.S.--I am afraid the money I left may be running short. Do not let this
stop you. Take my Facciolati to Johnson's, he will advance upon it; it
is the third row, bottom shelf. Only come."</DD>

<DD>
When this letter was despatched he had done all he could; and the next
two days passed like a long monotonous dream of watching, thought, and
care, undisturbed by any event, hardly by the change from day to night,
which, now the harvest moon was at her full, was scarcely perceptible.
On Saturday morning the answer came--</DD>

<DD>
"DEAREST THURSTAN,--Your incomprehensible summons has just reached me,
and I obey, thereby proving my right to my name of Faith. I shall be with
you almost as soon as this letter. I cannot help feeling anxious, as well
as curious. I have money enough, and it is well I have; for Sally, who
guards your room like a dragon, would rather see me walk the whole way,
than have any of your things disturbed.--Your affectionate sister,</DD>

<BR>&lt;CENTER"FAITH BENSON."
<DD>
It was a great relief to Mr. Benson to think that his sister would so soon
be with him. He had been accustomed from childhood to rely on her prompt
judgment and excellent sense; and to her care he felt that Ruth ought to
be consigned, as it was too much to go on taxing good Mrs. Hughes with
night watching and sick nursing, with all her other claims on her time.
He asked her once more to sit by Ruth, while he went to meet his sister.</DD>

<DD>
The coach passed by the foot of the steep ascent which led up to Llan-dhu.
He took a boy to carry his sister's luggage when they arrived; they were
too soon at the bottom of the hill; and the boy began to make ducks and
drakes in the shallowest part of the stream, which there flowed glassy
and smooth, while Mr. Benson sat down on a great stone, under the shadow
of an alderbush which grew where the green flat meadow skirted the water.
It was delightful to be once more in the open air, and away from the scenes
and thoughts which had been pressing on him for the last three days. There
was a new beauty in everything from the blue mountains which glimmered
in the distant sunlight, down to the flat, rich, peaceful vale, with its
calm round shadows, where he sat. The very margin of white pebbles which
lay on the banks of the stream had a sort of cleanly beauty about it. He
felt calmer and more at ease than he had done for some days; and yet, when
he began to think, it was rather a strange story which he had to tell his
sister, in order to account for his urgent summons. Here was he, sole friend
and guardian of a poor sick girl, whose very name he did not know; about
whom all that he did know was, that she had been the mistress of a man
who had deserted her, and that he feared--he believed--she had contemplated
suicide. The offence, too, was one for which his sister, good and kind
as she was, had little compassion. Well, he must appeal to her love for
him, which was a very unsatisfactory mode of proceeding, as he would far
rather have had her interest in the girl founded on reason, or some less
personal basis, than showing it merely because her brother wished it.</DD>

<DD>
The coach came slowly rumbling over the stony road. His sister was outside,
but got down in a brisk active way, and greeted her brother heartily and
affectionately. She was considerably taller than he was, and must have
been very handsome; her black hair was parted plainly over her forehead,
and her dark expressive eyes and straight nose still retained the beauty
of her youth. I do not know whether she was older than her brother; but,
probably owing to his infirmity requiring her care, she had something of
a mother's manner towards him.</DD>

<DD>
"Thurstan, you are looking pale! I do not believe you are well, whatever
you may say. Have you had the old pain in your back?"</DD>

<DD>
"No--a little--never mind that, dearest Faith. Sit down here, while I send
the boy up with your box." And then, with some little desire to show his
sister how well he was acquainted with the language, he blundered out his
directions in very grammatical Welsh; so grammatical, in fact, and so badly
pronounced, that the boy, scratching his head, made answer--</DD>

<DD>
"Dim Saesoneg."</DD>

<DD>
So he had to repeat it in English.</DD>

<DD>
"Well, now, Thurstan, here I sit as you bid me. But don't try me too long;
tell me why you sent for me."</DD>

<DD>
Now came the difficulty, and oh! for a seraph's tongue, and a seraph's
powers of representation! But there was no seraph at hand, only the soft
running waters singing a quiet tune, and predisposing Miss Benson to listen
with a soothed spirit to any tale, not immediately involving her brother's
welfare, which had been the cause of her seeing that lovely vale.</DD>

<DD>
"It is an awkward story to tell, Faith, but there is a young woman lying
ill at my lodgings whom I wanted you to nurse."</DD>

<DD>
He thought he saw a shadow on his sister's face, and detected a slight
change in her voice as she spoke.</DD>

<DD>
"Nothing very romantic, I hope, Thurstan. Remember, I cannot stand much
romance; I always distrust it."</DD>

<DD>
"I don't know what you mean by romance. The story is real enough, and not
out of the common way, I'm afraid."</DD>

<DD>
He paused; he did not get over the difficulty.</DD>

<DD>
"Well, tell it me at once, Thurstan. I am afraid you have let some one,
or perhaps only your own imagination, impose upon you; but don't try my
patience too much; you know I've no great stock."</DD>

<DD>
"Then I'll tell you. The young girl was brought to the inn here by a gentleman,
who has left her; she is very ill, and has no one to see after her."</DD>

<DD>
Miss Benson had some masculine tricks, and one was whistling a long, low
whistle when surprised or displeased. She had often found it a useful vent
for feelings, and she whistled now. Her brother would rather she had spoken.</DD>

<DD>
"Have you sent for her friends?" she asked, at last.</DD>

<DD>
"She has none."</DD>

<DD>
Another pause and another whistle, but rather softer and more wavering
than the last.</DD>

<DD>
"How is she ill?"</DD>

<DD>
"Pretty nearly as quiet as if she were dead. She does not speak, or move,
or even sigh."</DD>

<DD>
"It would be better for her to die at once, I think."</DD>

<DD>
"Faith!"</DD>

<DD>
That one word put them right. It was spoken in the tone which had authority
over her; it was so full of grieved surprise and mournful upbraiding. She
was accustomed to exercise a sway over him, owing to her greater decision
of character, and, probably, if everything were traced to its cause, to
her superior vigour of constitution; but at times she was humbled before
his pure, childlike nature, and felt where she was inferior. She was too
good and; true to conceal this feeling, or to resent its being forced upon
her. After a time she said--</DD>

<DD>
"Thurstan dear, let us go to her."</DD>

<DD>
She helped him with tender care, and gave him her arm up the long and tedious
hill; but when they approached the village, without speaking a word on
the subject, they changed their position, and she leant (apparently) on
him. He stretched himself up into as vigorous a gait as he could, when
they drew near to the abodes of men.</DD>

<DD>
On the way they had spoken but little. He had asked after various members
of his congregation, for he was a Dissenting minister in a country town,
and she had answered; but they neither of them spoke of Ruth, though their
minds were full of her.</DD>

<DD>
Mrs. Hughes had tea ready for the traveller on her arrival. Mr. Benson
chafed a little internally at the leisurely way in which his sister sipped
and sipped, and paused to tell him some trifling particular respecting
home affairs, which she had forgotten before.</DD>

<DD>
"Mr. Bradshaw has refused to let the children associate with the Dixons
any longer, because one evening they played at acting charades."</DD>

<DD>
"Indeed! A little more bread and butter, Faith?"</DD>

<DD>
"Thank you this Welsh air does make one hungry. Mrs. Bradshaw is paying
poor old Maggie's rent, to save her from being sent into the workhouse.</DD>

<DD>
"That's right. Won't you have another cup of tea?"</DD>

<DD>
"I have had two. However, I think I'll take another."</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Benson could not refrain from a little sigh as he poured it out. He
thought he had never seen his sister so deliberately hungry and thirsty
before. He did not guess that she was feeling the meal rather a respite
from a distasteful interview, which she was aware was awaiting her at its
conclusion. But all things come to an end, and so did Miss Benson's tea.</DD>

<DD>
"Now, will you go and see her?"</DD>

<DD>
"Yes."</DD>

<DD>
And so they went. Mrs. Hughes had pinned up a piece of green calico, by
way of a Venetian blind, to shut out the afternoon sun; and in the light
thus shaded lay Ruth--still, and wan, and white. Even with her brother's
account of Ruth's state, such death-like quietness startled Miss Benson--startled
her into pity for the poor lovely creature who lay thus stricken and felled.
When she saw her, she could no longer imagine her to be an impostor, or
a hardened sinner; such prostration of woe belonged to neither. Mr. Benson
looked more at his sister's face than at Ruth's; he read her countenance
as a book.</DD>

<DD>
Mrs. Hughes stood by, crying.</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Benson touched his sister, and they left the room together.</DD>

<DD>
"Do you think she will live?" asked he.</DD>

<DD>
"I cannot tell," said Miss Benson, in a softened voice. "But how young
she looks! quite a child, poor creature! When will the doctor come, Thurstan?
Tell me all about her; you have never told me the particulars."</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Benson might have said she had never cared to hear them before, and
had rather avoided the subject; but he was too happy to see this awakening
of interest in his sister's warm heart to say anything in the least reproachful.
He told her the story as well as he could, and, as he felt it deeply, he
told it with heart's eloquence; and as he ended, and looked at her, there
were tears in the eyes of both.</DD>

<DD>
"And what does the doctor say?" asked she, after a pause.</DD>

<DD>
"He insists upon quiet; he orders medicines and strong broth. I cannot
tell you all; Mrs. Hughes can. She has been so truly good. 'Doing good,
hoping for nothing again.'"</DD>

<DD>
"She looks very sweet and gentle. I shall sit up to night, and watch her
myself; and I shall send you and Mrs. Hughes early to bed, for you have
both a worn look about you I don't like. Are you sure the effect of that
fall has gone off? Do you feel anything of it in your back still? After
all, I owe her something for turning back to your help. Are you sure she
was going to drown herself?"</DD>

<DD>
"I cannot be sure, for I have not questioned her. She has not been in a
state to be questioned; but I have no doubt whatever about it. But you
must not think of sitting up after your journey, Faith."</DD>

<DD>
"Answer me, Thurstan. Do you feel any bad effect from that fall?"</DD>

<DD>
"No, hardly any. Don't sit up, Faith, to-night!"</DD>

<DD>
"Thurstan, it's no use talking, for I shall; and, if you go on opposing
me, I dare say I shall attack your back, and, put a blister on it. Do tell
me what that 'hardly any' means. Besides, to set you quite at ease, you
know I have never seen mountains before, and they fill me and oppress me
so much that I could not sleep; I must keep awake this first night, and
see that they don't fall on the earth and overwhelm it. And now answer
my questions about yourself."</DD>

<DD>
Miss Benson had the power, which some people have, of carrying her wishes
through to their fulfilment; her will was strong, her sense was excellent,
and people yielded to her--they did not know why. Before ten o'clock she
reigned sole power and potentate in Ruth's little chamber. Nothing could
have been better devised for giving her an interest in the invalid. The
very dependence of one so helpless upon her care inclined her heart towards
her. She thought she perceived a slight improvement in the symptoms during
the night, and she was a little pleased that this progress should have
been made while she reigned monarch of the sick-room. Yes, certainly there
was an improvement. There was more consciousness in the look of the eyes,
although the whole countenance still retained its painful traces of acute
suffering, manifested in an anxious, startled uneasy aspect. It was broad
morning light, though barely five o'clock, when Miss Benson caught the
sight of Ruth's lips moving, as if in speech. Miss Benson stooped down
to listen.</DD>

<DD>
"Who are you?" asked Ruth, in the faintest of whispers.</DD>

<DD>
"Miss Benson--Mr. Benson's sister," she replied.</DD>

<DD>
The words conveyed no knowledge to Ruth; on the contrary, weak as a babe
in mind and body as she was, her lips began to quiver, and her eyes to
show a terror similar to that of any little child who wakens in the presence
of a stranger, and sees no dear, familiar face of mother or nurse to reassure
its trembling heart.</DD>

<DD>
Miss Benson took her hand in hers, and began to stroke it caressingly.</DD>

<DD>
"Don't be afraid, dear; I'm a friend come to take care of you. Would you
like some tea now, my love ?"</DD>

<DD>
The very utterance of these gentle words was unlocking Miss Benson's heart.
Her brother was surprised to see her so full of interest when he came to
inquire later on in the morning. It required Mrs. Hughes's persuasions,
as well as his own, to induce her to go to bed for an hour or two after
breakfast; and, before she went, she made them promise that she should
be called when the doctor came. He did not come until late in the afternoon.
The invalid was rallying fast, though rallying to a consciousness of sorrow,
as was evinced by the tears which came slowly rolling down her pale sad
cheeks--tears which she had not the power to wipe away.</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Benson had remained in the house all day to hear the doctor's opinion;
and, now that he was relieved from the charge of Ruth by his sister's presence,
he had the more time to dwell upon the circumstances of her case--so far
as they were known to him. He remembered his first sight of her; her lithe
figure swaying to and fro as she balanced herself on the slippery stones,
half smiling at her own dilemma, with a bright, happy light in the eyes,
that seemed like a reflection from the glancing waters sparkling below.
Then he recalled the changed, affrighted look of those eyes as they met
his, after the child's rebuff of her advances; how that little incident
filled up the tale at which Mrs. Hughes had hinted, in a kind of sorrowful
way, as if loath (as a Christian should be) to believe evil. Then that
fearful evening, when he had only just saved her from committing suicide,
and that nightmare sleep! And now--lost, forsaken, and but just delivered
from the jaws of death, she lay dependent for everything on his sister
and him--utter strangers a few weeks ago. Where was her lover? Could he
be easy and happy? Could he grow into perfect health, with these great
sins pressing on his conscience with a strong and hard pain? Or had he
a conscience?"</DD>

<DD>
Into whole labyrinths of social ethics Mr. Benson's thoughts wandered,
when his sister entered suddenly and abruptly.</DD>

<DD>
"What does the doctor say? Is she better?"</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, yes! she's better," answered Miss Benson, sharp and short. Her brother
looked at her in dismay. She bumped down into a chair in a cross, disconcerted
manner. They were both silent for a few minutes, only Miss Benson whistled
and clucked alternately.</DD>

<DD>
"What is the matter, Faith? You say she is better."</DD>

<DD>
"Why, Thurstan, there is something so shocking the matter, that I cannot
tell you."</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Benson changed colour with affright. All things possible and impossible
crossed his mind but the right one. I said, "all things possible"; I made
a mistake. He never believed Ruth to be more guilty than she seemed.</DD>

<DD>
"Faith, I wish you would tell me, and not bewilder me with those noises
of yours," said he nervously.</DD>

<DD>
"I beg your pardon; but something so shocking has just been discovered--I
don't know how to word it--she will have a child. The doctor says so."</DD>

<DD>
She was allowed to make noises unnoticed for a few minutes. Her brother
did not speak. At last she wanted his sympathy.</DD>

<DD>
"Isn't it shocking, Thurstan? You might have knocked me down with a straw
when he told me."</DD>

<DD>
"Does she know?"</DD>

<DD>
"Yes; and I am not sure that that isn't the worst part of all."</DD>

<DD>
"How?--what do you mean?"</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, I was just beginning to have a good opinion of her; but I'm afraid
she is very depraved. After the doctor was gone, she pulled the bed-curtain
aside, and looked as if she wanted to speak to me. (I can't think how she
heard, for we were close to the window, and spoke very low.) Well, I went
to her, though I really had taken quite a turn against her. And she whispered,
quite eagerly, 'Did he say I should have a baby?' Of course I could not
keep it from her; but I thought it my duty to look as cold and severe as
I could. She did not seem to understand how it ought to be viewed, but
took it just as if she had a right to have a baby. She said, 'Oh, my God,
I thank Thee! Oh, I will be so good!' I had no patience with her then,
so I left the room."</DD>

<DD>
"Who is with her?"</DD>

<DD>
"Mrs. Hughes. She is not seeing the thing in a moral light, as I should
have expected."</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Benson was silent again. After some time he began--</DD>

<DD>
"Faith, I don't see this affair quite as you do. I believe I am right."</DD>

<DD>
"You surprise me, brother! I don't understand you."</DD>

<DD>
"Wait awhile! I want to make my feelings very clear to you, but I don't
know where to begin, or how to express myself."</DD>

<DD>
"It is, indeed, an extraordinary subject for us to have to talk about;
but, if once I get clear of this girl, I'll wash my hands of all such cases
again."</DD>

<DD>
Her brother was not attending to her; he was reducing his own ideas to
form.</DD>

<DD>
"Faith, do you know I rejoice in this child's advent?"</DD>

<DD>
"May God forgive you, Thurstan!--if you know what you are saying. But,
surely, it is a temptation, dear Thurstan."</DD>

<DD>
"I do not think it is a delusion. The sin appears to me to be quite distinct
from its consequences."</DD>

<DD>
"Sophistry--and a temptation," said Miss Benson decidedly.</DD>

<DD>
"No, it is not," said her brother, with equal decision. "In the eye of
God, she is exactly the same as if the life she has led had left no trace
behind. We knew her errors before, Faith."</DD>

<DD>
"Yes, but not this disgrace--this badge of her shame!"</DD>

<DD>
"Faith, Faith! let me beg of you not to speak so of the little innocent
babe, who may be God's messenger to lead her back to Him. Think again of
her first words--the burst of nature from her heart! Did she not turn to
God, and enter into a covenant with Him--'I will be so good'? Why, it draws
her out of herself! If her life has hitherto been self-seeking and wickedly
thoughtless, here is the very instrument to make her forget herself, and
be thoughtful for another. Teach her (and God will teach her, if man does
not come between) to reverence her child; and this reverence will shut
out sin,--will be purification."</DD>

<DD>
He was very much excited; he was even surprised at his own excitement;
but his thoughts and meditations through the long afternoon had prepared
his mind for this manner of viewing the subject.</DD>

<DD>
"These are quite new ideas to me," said Miss Benson coldly. "I think you,
Thurstan, are the first person I ever heard rejoicing over the birth of
an illegitimate child. It appears to me, I must own, rather questionable
morality."</DD>

<DD>
"I do not rejoice. I have been all this afternoon mourning over the sin
which has blighted this young creature; I have been dreading lest, as she
recovered consciousness, there should be a return of her despair. I have
been thinking of every holy word, every promise to the penitent--of the
tenderness which led the Magdalen aright. I have been feeling, severely
and reproachfully, the timidity which has hitherto made me blink all encounter
with evils of this particular kind. O Faith! once for all, do not accuse
me of questionable morality, when I am trying more than ever I did in my
life to act as my blessed Lord would have done."</DD>

<DD>
He was very much agitated. His sister hesitated, and then she spoke more
softly than before--</DD>

<DD>
"But, Thurstan, everything might have been done to 'lead her right' (as
you call it), without this child, this miserable offspring of sin."</DD>

<DD>
"The world has, indeed, made such children miserable, innocent as they
are; but I doubt if this be according to the will of God, unless it be
His punishment for the parents' guilt; and even then the world's way of
treatment is too apt to harden the mother's natural love into something
like hatred. Shame, and the terror of friends' displeasure, turn her mad--defile
her holiest instincts; and, as for the fathers--God forgive them! I cannot--at
least, not just now."</DD>

<DD>
Miss Benson thought on what her brother said. At length she asked, "Thurstan
(remember I'm not convinced), how would you have this girl treated according
to your theory?"</DD>

<DD>
"It will require some time, and much Christian love, to find out the best
way. I know I'm not very wise; but the way I think it would be right to
act in, would be this----" He thought for some time before he spoke, and
then said--</DD>

<DD>
"She has incurred a responsibility--that we both acknowledge. She is about
to become a mother, and have the direction and guidance of a little tender
life. I fancy such a responsibility must be serious and solemn enough,
without making it into a heavy and oppressive burden, so that human nature
recoils from bearing it. While we do all we can to strengthen her sense
of responsibility, I would likewise do all we can to make her feel that
it is responsibility for what may become a blessing."</DD>

<DD>
"Whether the children are legitimate or illegitimate?" asked Miss Benson
dryly.</DD>

<DD>
"Yes!" said her brother firmly. "The more I think, the more I believe I
am right. No one," said he, blushing faintly as he spoke, "can have a greater
recoil from proffigacy than I have. You yourself have not greater sorrow
over this young creature's sin than I have the difference is this, you
confuse the consequences with the sin."</DD>

<DD>
"I don't understand metaphysics."</DD>

<DD>
"I am not aware that I am talking metaphysics. I can imagine that if the
present occasion be taken rightly, and used well, all that is good in her
may be raised to a height unmeasured but by God; while all that is evil
and dark may, by His blessing, fade and disappear in the pure light of
her child's presence.--Oh, Father! listen to my prayer, that her redemption
may date from this time. Help us to speak to her in the loving spirit of
thy Holy Son!"</DD>

<DD>
The tears were full in his eyes; he almost trembled in his earnestness.
He was faint with the strong power of his own conviction, and with his
inability to move his sister. But she was shaken. She sat very still for
a quarter of an hour or more while he leaned back, exhausted by his own
feelings.</DD>

<DD>
"The poor child!" said she at length--"the poor, poor child! what it will
have to struggle through and endure! Do you remember Thomas Wilkins, and
the way he threw the registry of his birth and baptism back in your face?
Why, he would not have the situation; he went to sea, and was drowned,
rather than present the record of his shame."</DD>

<DD>
"I do remember it all. It has often haunted me. She must strengthen her
child to look to God, rather than to man's opinion. It will be the discipline,
the penance, she has incurred. She must teach it to be (humanly speaking)
self-dependent."</DD>

<DD>
"But after all," said Miss Benson (for she had known and esteemed poor
Thomas Wilkins, and had mourned over his untimely death, and the recollection
thereof softened her)--"after all, it might be concealed. The very child
need never know its illegitimacy."</DD>

<DD>
"How?" asked her brother.</DD>

<DD>
"Why--we know so little about her yet; but in that letter, it said she
had no friends;--now, could she not go into quite a fresh place, and be
passed off as a widow?"</DD>

<DD>
Ah, tempter! unconscious tempter! Here was a way of evading the trials
for the poor little unborn child, of which Mr. Benson had never thought.
It was the decision--the pivot, on which the fate of years moved; and he
turned it the wrong way. But it was not for his own sake. For himself,
he was brave enough to tell the truth; for the little helpless baby, about
to enter a cruel, biting world, he was tempted to evade the difficulty.
He forgot what he had just said, of the discipline and the penance to the
mother consisting in strengthening her child to meet, trustfully and bravely,
the consequences of her own weakness. He remembered more clearly the wild
fierceness, the Cain-like look, of Thomas Wilkins, as the obnoxious word
in the baptismal registry told him that he must go forth branded into the
world, with his hand against every man's, and every man's against him.</DD>

<DD>
"How could it be managed, Faith?"</DD>
