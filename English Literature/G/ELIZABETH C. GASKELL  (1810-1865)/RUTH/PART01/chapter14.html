Ruth felt very shy when she came down (at half-past seven) the next morning,
in her widow's cap. Her smooth, pale face, with its oval untouched by time,
looked more young and childlike than ever, when contrasted with the head-gear
usually associated with ideas of age. She blushed very deeply as Mr. and
Miss Benson showed the astonishment, which they could not conceal, in their
looks. She said in a low voice to Miss Benson--</DD>

<DD>
"Sally thought I had better wear it."</DD>

<DD>
Miss Benson made no reply; but was startled at the intelligence, which
she thought was conveyed in this speech, of Sally's acquaintance with Ruth's
real situation. She noticed Sally's looks particularly this morning. The
manner in which the old servant treated Ruth had in it far more of respect
than there had been the day before; but there was a kind of satisfied way
of braving out Miss Benson's glances which made the latter uncertain and
uncomfortable.</DD>

<DD>
She followed her brother into his study.</DD>

<DD>
"Do you know, Thurstan, I am almost certain Sally suspects."</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Benson sighed. That deception grieved him, and yet he thought he saw
its necessity.</DD>

<DD>
"What makes you think so?" asked he.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh! many little things. It was her odd way of ducking her head about,
as if to catch a good view of Ruth's left hand, that made me think of the
wedding-ring; and once, yesterday, when I thought I had made up quite a
natural speech, and was saying how sad it was for so young a creature to
be left a widow she broke in with 'widow be farred!' in a very strange,
contemptuous kind of manner."</DD>

<DD>
"If she suspects, we had far better tell her the truth at once. She will
never rest till she finds it out, so we must make a virtue of necessity."</DD>

<DD>
"Well, brother, you shall tell her then, for I am sure I daren't. I don't
mind doing the thing, since you talked to me that day, and since I have
got to know Ruth; but I do mind all the clatter people will make about
it."</DD>

<DD>
"But Sally is not 'people.'"</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, I see it must be done; she'll talk as much as all the other persons
put together, so that's the reason I call her 'people.' Shall I call her?"
(For the house was too homely and primitive to have bells.)</DD>

<DD>
Sally came, fully aware of what was now going to be told her, and determined
not to help them out in telling their awkward secret, by understanding
the nature of it before it was put into the plainest language. In every
pause, when they hoped she had caught the meaning they were hinting at,
she persisted in looking stupid and perplexed, and in saying, "Well," as
if quite unenlightened as to the end of the story. When it was all complete
and before her, she said, honestly enough--</DD>

<DD>
"It's just as I thought it was; and I think you may thank me for having
had the sense to put her into widow's caps, and clip off that bonny brown
hair that was fitter for a bride in lawful matrimony than for such as her.
She took it very well, though. She was as quiet as a lamb, and I clipped
her pretty roughly at first. I must say, though, if I'd ha' known who your
visitor was, I'd ha' packed up my things and cleared myself out of the
house before such as her came into it. As it's done, I suppose I must stand
by you, and help you through with it; I only hope I sha'n't lose my character--and
me a parish-clerk's daughter!"</DD>

<DD>
"O Sally! people know you too well to think any ill of you," said Miss
Benson, who was pleased to find the difficulty so easily got over; for,
in truth, Sally had been much softened by the unresisting gentleness with
which Ruth had submitted to the "clipping" of the night before.</DD>

<DD>
"If I'd been with you, Master Thurstan, I'd ha' seen sharp after you, for
you're always picking up some one or another as nobody else would touch
with a pair of tongs. Why, there was that Nelly Brandon's child as was
left at our door, if I hadn't gone to th' overseer we should have had that
Irish tramp's babby saddled on us for life; but I went off and told th'
overseer, and the mother was caught."</DD>

<DD>
"Yes," said Mr. Benson sadly, "and I often lie awake and wonder what is
the fate of that poor little thing, forced back on the mother who tried
to get quit of it. I often doubt whether I did right; but it's no use thinking
about it now."</DD>

<DD>
"I'm thankful it isn't," said Sally; "and now, if we've talked doctrine
long enough, I'll make th' beds. Yon girl's secret is safe enough for me."</DD>

<DD>
Saying this she left the room, and Miss Benson followed. She found Ruth
busy washing the breakfast things; and they were done in so quiet and orderly
a manner, that neither Miss Benson nor Sally, both particular enough, had
any of their little fancies or prejudices annoyed. She seemed to have an
instinctive knowledge of the exact period when her help was likely to become
a hindrance, and withdrew from the busy kitchen just at the right time.</DD>

<DD>
That afternoon, as Miss Benson and Ruth sat at their work, Mrs. and Miss
Bradshaw called. Miss Benson was so nervous as to surprise Ruth, who did
not understand the probable and possible questions which might be asked
respecting any visitor at the minister's house. Ruth went on sewing, absorbed
in her own thoughts, and glad that the conversation between the two elder
ladies and the silence of the younger one, who sat at some distance from
her, gave her an opportunity of retreating into the haunts of memory; and
soon the work fell from her hands, and her eyes were fixed on the little
garden beyond, but she did not see its flowers or its walls; she saw the
mountains which girdled Llan-dhu, and saw the sun rise from behind their
iron outline, just as it had done--how long ago? was it months or was it
years?--since she had watched the night through, crouched up at <I>his</I>
door. Which was the dream and which the reality? that distant life or this?
His moans rang more clearly in her ears than the buzzing of the conversation
between Mrs. Bradshaw and Miss Benson.</DD>

<DD>
At length the subdued, scared-looking little lady and her bright-eyed silent
daughter rose to take leave; Ruth started into the present, and stood up
and curtseyed, and turned sick at heart with sudden recollection.</DD>

<DD>
Miss Benson accompanied Mrs. Bradshaw to the door; and in the passage gave
her a long explanation of Ruth's (fictitious) history. Mrs. Bradshaw looked
so much interested and pleased, that Miss Benson enlarged a little more
than was necessary, and rounded off her invention with one or two imaginary
details, which, she was quite unconscious, were overheard by her brother
through the half-open study door.</DD>

<DD>
She was rather dismayed when he called her into his room after Mrs. Bradshaw's
departure, and asked her what she had been saying about Ruth?</DD>

<DD>
"Oh! I thought it was better to explain it thoroughly--I mean, to tell
the story we wished to have believed once for all--you know we agreed about
that, Thurstan?" deprecatingly.</DD>

<DD>
"Yes; but I heard you saying you believed her husband had been a young
surgeon, did I not?"</DD>

<DD>
"Well, Thurstan, you know he must have been something; and young surgeons
are so in the way of dying, it seemed very natural. Besides," said she
with sudden boldness, "I do think I've a talent for fiction, it is so pleasant
to invent, and make the incidents dovetail together; and after all, if
we are to tell a lie, we may as well do it thoroughly, or else it's of
no use. A bungling lie would be worse than useless. And, Thurstan--it may
be very wrong--but I believe--I am afraid I enjoy not being fettered by
truth. Don't look so grave. You know it is necessary, if ever it was, to
tell falsehoods now; and don't be angry with me because I do it well."</DD>

<DD>
He was shading his eyes with his hand, and did not speak for some time.
At last he said--</DD>

<DD>
"If it were not for the child, I would tell all; but the world is so cruel.
You don't know how this apparent necessity for falsehood pains me, Faith,
or you would not invent all these details, which are so many additional
lies."</DD>

<DD>
"Well, well! I will restrain myself if I have to talk about Ruth again.
But Mrs. Bradshaw will tell every one who need to know. You don't wish
me to contradict it, Thurstan, surely--it was such a pretty, probable story."</DD>

<DD>
"Faith! I hope God will forgive us if we are doing wrong; and pray, dear,
don't add one unnecessary word that is not true."</DD>

<DD>
Another day elapsed, and then it was Sunday: and the house seemed filled
with a deep peace. Even Sally's movements were less hasty and abrupt. Mr.
Benson seemed invested with a new dignity, which made his bodily deformity
be forgotten in his calm, grave composure of spirit. Every trace of week-day
occupation was put away; the night before, a bright new handsome tablecloth
had been smoothed down over the table, and the jars had been freshly filled
with flowers. Sunday was a festival and a holyday in the house. After the
very early breakfast, little feet pattered into Mr. Benson's study, for
he had a class for boys--a sort of domestic Sunday-school, only that there
was more talking between teachers and pupils, than dry, absolute lessons
going on. Miss Benson, too, had her little, neat-tippeted maidens sitting
with her in the parlour; and she was far more particular in keeping them
to their reading and spelling than her brother was with his boys. Sally,
too, put in her word of instruction from the kitchen, helping, as she fancied,
though her assistance was often rather <I>malapropos</I>; for instance,
she called out, to a little fat, stupid, roly-poly girl, to whom Miss Benson
was busy explaining the meaning of the word quadruped--</DD>

<DD>
"Quadruped, a thing wi' four legs, Jenny; a chair is a quadruped, child!"</DD>

<DD>
But Miss Benson had a deaf manner sometimes when her patience was not too
severely tried, and she put it on now. Ruth sat on a low hassock, and coaxed
the least of the little creatures to her, and showed it pictures till it
fell asleep in her arms, and sent a thrill through her, at the thought
of the tiny darling who would lie on her breast before long, and whom she
would have to cherish and to shelter from the storms of the world.</DD>

<DD>
And then she remembered, that she was once white and sinless as the wee
lassie who lay in her arms; and she knew that she had gone astray. By-and-by
the children trooped away, and Miss Benson summoned her to put on he? things
for chapel.</DD>

<DD>
The chapel was up a narrow street, or rather <I>cul-de-sac</I>, close by.
It stood on the outskirts of the town, almost in fields. It was built about
the time of Matthew and Philip Henry, when the Dissenters were afraid of
attracting attention or observation, and hid their places of worship in
obscure and out-of-the-way parts of the towns in which they were built.
Accordingly, it often happened, as in the present case, that the buildings
immediately surrounding, as well as the chapels themselves, looked as if
they carried you back to a period a hundred and fifty years ago. The chapel
had a picturesque and old-world look, for luckily the congregation had
been too poor to rebuild it, or new-face it, in George the Third's time.
The staircases which led to the galleries were outside, at each end of
the building, and the irregular roof and worn stone steps looked grey and
stained by time and weather. The grassy hillocks, each with a little upright
headstone, were shaded by a grand old wych-elm. A lilac-bush or two, a
white rose-tree, and a few laburnums, all old and gnarled enough, were
planted round the chapel yard; and the casement windows of the chapel were
made of heavy-leaded, diamond-shaped panes, almost covered with ivy, producing
a green gloom, not without its solemnity, within. This ivy was the home
of an infinite number of little birds, which twittered and warbled, till
it might have been thought that they were emulous of the power of praise
possessed by the human creatures within, with such earnest, long-drawn
strains did this crowd of winged songsters rejoice and be glad in their
beautiful gift of life. The interior of the building was plain and simple
as plain and simple could be. When it was fitted up, oak-timber was much
cheaper than it is now, so the wood-work was all of that description; but
roughly hewed, for the early builders had not much wealth to spare. The
walls were whitewashed, and were recipients of the shadows of the beauty
without; on their "white plains" the tracery of the ivy might be seen,
now still, now stirred by the sudden flight of some little bird. The congregation
consisted of here and there a farmer with his labourers, who came down
from the uplands beyond the town to worship where their fathers worshipped,
and who loved the place because they knew how much those fathers had suffered
for it, although they never troubled themselves with the reason why they
left the parish church; and of a few shopkeepers, far more thoughtful and
reasoning, who were Dissenters from conviction, unmixed with old. ancestral
association; and of one or two families of still higher worldly station.
With many poor, who were drawn there by love for Mr. Benson's character,
and by a feeling that the faith which made him what he was could not be
far wrong, for the base of the pyramid, and with Mr. Bradshaw for its apex,
the congregation stood complete.</DD>

<DD>
The country people came in sleeking down their hair, and treading with
earnest attempts at noiseless lightness of step over the floor of the aisle;
and, by-and-by, when all were assembled, Mr. Benson followed, unmarshalled
and unattended. When he had closed the pulpit-door, and knelt in prayer
for an instant or two, he gave out a psalm from the dear old Scottish paraphrase,
with its primitive inversion of the simple perfect Bible words; and a kind
of precentor stood up, and, having sounded the note on a pitch-pipe, sang
a couple of lines by way of indicating the tune; then all the congregation
stood up, and sang aloud, Mr. Bradshaw's great bass voice being half a
note in advance of the others, in accordance with his place of precedence
as principal member of the congregation. His powerful voice was like an
organ very badly played, and very much out of tune; but as he had no ear,
and no diffidence, it pleased him very much to hear the fine loud sound.
He was a tall, large-boned, iron man; stern, powerful, and authoritative
in appearance; dressed in clothes of the finest broadcloth, and scrupulously
ill-made, as if to show that he was indifferent to all outward things.
His wife was sweet and gentle-looking, but as if she was thoroughly broken
into submission.</DD>

<DD>
Ruth did not see this, or hear aught but the words which were reverently--oh,
how reverently!--spoken by Mr. Benson. He had had Ruth present in his thoughts
all the time he had been preparing for his Sunday duty; and he had tried
carefully to eschew everything which she might feel as an allusion to her
own case. He remembered how the Good Shepherd, in Poussin's beautiful picture,
tenderly carried the lambs which had wearied themselves by going astray,
and felt how like tenderness was required towards poor Ruth. But where
is the chapter which does not contain something which a broken and contrite
spirit may not apply to itself? And so it fell out that, as he read, Ruth's
heart was smitten, and she sank down, and down, till she was kneeling on
the floor of the pew, and speaking to God in the spirit, if not in the
words, of the Prodigal Son: "Father! I have sinned against Heaven and before
Thee, and am no more worthy to be called Thy child!" Miss Benson was thankful
(although she loved Ruth the better for this self-abandonment) that the
minister's seat was far in the shade of the gallery. She tried to look
most attentive to her brother, in order that Mr. Bradshaw might not suspect
anything unusual, while she stealthily took hold of Ruth's passive hand,
as it lay helpless on the cushion, and pressed it softly and tenderly.
But Ruth sat on the ground, bowed down and crushed in her sorrow, till
all was ended.</DD>

<DD>
Miss Benson loitered in her seat, divided between the consciousness that
she, as <I>locum tenens</I> for the minister's wife, was expected to be
at the door to receive the kind greetings of many after her absence from
home, and her unwillingness to disturb Ruth, who was evidently praying,
and, by her quiet breathing, receiving grave and solemn influences into
her soul. At length she rose up, calm and composed even to dignity. The
chapel was still and empty; but Miss Benson heard the buzz of voices in
the chapel-yard without. They were probably those of people waiting for
her; and she summoned courage, and taking Ruth's arm in hers, and holding
her hand affectionately, they went out into the broad daylight. As they
issued forth, Miss Benson heard Mr. Bradshaw's strong bass voice speaking
to her brother, and winced, as she knew he would be wincing, under the
broad praise, which is impertinence, however little it may be intended
or esteemed as such.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, yes!--my wife told me yesterday about her--her husband was a surgeon;
my father was a surgeon too, as I think you have heard. Very much to your
credit, I must say, Mr. Benson, with your limited means, to burden yourself
with a poor relation. Very creditable indeed."</DD>

<DD>
Miss Benson glanced at Ruth; she either did not hear or did not understand,
but passed on into the awful sphere of Mr. Bradshaw's observation unmoved.
He was in a bland and condescending humour of universal approval, and when
he saw Ruth he nodded his head in token of satisfaction. That ordeal was
over, Miss Benson thought, and in the thought rejoiced.</DD>

<DD>
"After dinner, you must go and lie down, my dear," said she, untying Ruth's
bonnet-strings, and kissing her. "Sally goes to church again, but you won't
mind staying alone in the house. I am sorry we have so many people to dinner;
but my brother will always have enough on Sundays for any old or weak people,
who may have come from a distance, to stay and dine with us; and to-day
they all seem to have come, because it is his first Sabbath at home.</DD>

<DD>
In this way Ruth's first Sunday passed over.</DD>
