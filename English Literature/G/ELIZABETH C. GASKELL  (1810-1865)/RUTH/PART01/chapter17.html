<DD>
In that body of Dissenters to which Mr. Benson belonged, it is not considered
necessary to baptize infants as early as the ceremony can be performed;
and many circumstances concurred to cause the solemn thanksgiving and dedication
of the child (for so these Dissenters looked upon christenings) to be deferred
until it was probably somewhere about six months old. There had been many
conversations in the little sitting-room between the brother and sister
and their <I>protegee</I>, which had consisted of questions betraying a
thoughtful wondering kind of ignorance on the part of Ruth, and answers
more suggestive than explanatory from Mr. Benson; while Miss Benson kept
up a kind of running commentary, always simple and often quaint, but with
that intuition into the very heart of all things truly religious which
is often the gift of those who seem, at first sight, to be only affectionate
and sensible. When Mr. Benson had explained his own views of what a christening
ought to be considered, and, by calling out Ruth's latent feelings into
pious earnestness, brought her into a right frame of mind, he felt that
he had done what he could to make the ceremony more than a mere form, and
to invest it, quiet, humble, and obscure as it must necessarily be in outward
shape--mournful and anxious as many of its antecedents had rendered it--with
the severe grandeur of an act done in faith and truth.</DD>

<DD>
It was not far to carry the little one, for, as I said, the chapel almost
adjoined the minister's house. The whole procession was to have consisted
of Mr. and Miss Benson, Ruth carrying her babe, and Sally, who felt herself,
as a Church-of-England woman, to be condescending and kind in requesting
leave to attend a baptism among "them Dissenters" but unless she had asked
permission, she would not have been desired to attend, so careful was the
habit of her master and mistress that she should be allowed that freedom
which they claimed for themselves. But they were glad she wished to go;
they liked the feeling that all were of one household, and that the interests
of one were the interests of all. It produced a consequence, however, which
they did not anticipate. Sally was full of the event which her presence
was to sanction, and, as it were, to redeem from the character of being
utterly schismatic; she spoke about it with an air of patronage to three
or four, and among them to some of the servants at Mr. Bradshaw's.</DD>

<DD>
Miss Benson was rather surprised to receive a call from Jemima Bradshaw,
on the very morning of the day on which little Leonard was to be baptized;
Miss Bradshaw was rosy and breathless with eagerness. Although the second
in the family, she had been at school when her younger sisters had been
christened, and she was now come, in the full warmth of a girl's fancy,
to ask if she might be present at the afternoon's service. She had been
struck with Mrs. Denbigh's grace and beauty at the very first sight, when
she had accompanied her mother to call upon the Bensons on their return
from Wales; and had kept up an enthusiastic interest in the widow only
a little older than herself, whose very reserve and retirement but added
to her unconscious power of enchantment.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, Miss Benson! I never saw a christening; papa says I may go, if you
think Mr. Benson and Mrs. Denbigh would not dislike it; and I will be quite
quiet, and sit up behind the door, or anywhere; and that sweet little baby!
I should so like to see him christened; is he to be called Leonard, did
you say? After Mr. Denbigh, is it?"</DD>

<DD>
"No--not exactly," said Miss Benson, rather discomfited.</DD>

<DD>
"Was not Mr. Denbigh's name Leonard, then? Mamma thought it would be sure
to be called after him, and so did I. But I may come to the christening,
may I not, dear Miss Benson?"</DD>

<DD>
Miss Benson gave her consent with a little inward reluctance. Both her
brother and Ruth shared in this feeling, although no one expressed it;
and it was presently forgotten.</DD>

<DD>
Jemima stood grave and quiet in the old-fashioned vestry adjoining the
chapel, as they entered with steps subdued to slowness. She thought Ruth
looked so pale and awed because she was left a solitary parent; but Ruth
came to the presence of God, as one who had gone astray, and doubted her
own worthiness to be called His child; she came as a mother who had incurred
a heavy responsibility, and who entreated His almighty aid to enable her
to discharge it; full of passionate, yearning love which craved for more
faith in God, to still her distrust and fear of the future that might hang
over her darling. When she thought of her boy, she sickened and trembled:
but when she heard of God's loving-kindness, far beyond all tender mother's
love, she was hushed into peace and prayer. There she stood, her fair pale
cheek resting on her baby's head, as he slumbered on her bosom; her eyes
went slanting down under their half-closed white lids; but their gaze was
not on the primitive cottage-like room, it was earnestly fixed on a dim
mist, through which she fain would have seen the life that lay before her
child; but the mist was still and dense, too thick a veil for anxious human
love to penetrate. The future was hid with God.</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Benson stood right under the casement window that was placed high up
in the room; he was almost in shade, except for one or two marked lights
which fell on hair already silvery white; his voice was always low and
musical when he spoke to few; it was too weak to speak so as to be heard
by many without becoming harsh and strange; but now it filled the little
room with a loving sound, like the stock-dove's brooding murmur over her
young. He and Ruth forgot all in their earnestness of thought; and when
he said "Let us pray," and the little congregation knelt down you might
have heard the baby's faint breathing, scarcely sighing out upon the stillness,
so absorbed were all in the solemnity. But the prayer was long; thought
followed thought, and fear crowded upon fear, and all were to be laid bare
before God, and His aid and counsel asked. Before the end, Sally had shuffled
quietly out of the vestry into the green chapel-yard, upon which the door
opened. Miss Benson was alive to this movement, and so full of curiosity
as to what it might mean that she could no longer attend to her brother,
and felt inclined to rush off and question Sally, the moment all was ended.
Miss Bradshaw hung about the babe and Ruth, and begged to be allowed to
carry the child home, but Ruth pressed him to her, as if there was no safe
harbour for him but in his mother's breast. Mr. Benson saw her feeling,
and caught Miss Bradshaw's look of disappointment.</DD>

<DD>
"Come home with us," said he, "and stay to tea. You have never drunk tea
with us since you went to school."</DD>

<DD>
"I wish I might," said Miss Bradshaw, colouring with pleasure. "But I must
ask papa. May I run home and ask?"</DD>

<DD>
"To be sure, my dear!"</DD>

<DD>
Jemima flew off; and fortunately her father was at home; for her mother's
permission would have been deemed insufficient. She received many directions
about her behaviour.</DD>

<DD>
"Take no sugar in your tea, Jemima. I am sure the Bensons ought not to
be able to afford sugar, with their means. And do not eat much; you can
have plenty at home on your return; remember Mrs. Denbigh's keep must cost
them a great deal."</DD>

<DD>
So Jemima returned considerably sobered, and very much afraid of her hunger
leading her to forget Mr. Benson's poverty. Meanwhile Miss Benson and Sally,
acquainted with Mr. Benson's invitation to Jemima, set about making some
capital tea-cakes on which they piqued themselves. They both enjoyed the
offices of hospitality; and were glad to place some home-made tempting
dainty before their guests.</DD>

<DD>
"What made ye leave the chapel-vestry before my brother had ended?" inquired
Miss Benson.</DD>

<DD>
"Indeed, ma'am, I thought master had prayed so long he'd be drouthy. So
I just slipped out to put on the kettle for tea."</DD>

<DD>
Miss Benson was on the point of reprimanding her for thinking of anything
besides the object of the prayer, when she remembered how she herself had
been unable to attend after Sally's departure for wondering what had become
of her; so she was silent.</DD>

<DD>
It was a disappointment to Miss Benson's kind and hospitable expectation
when Jemima, as hungry as a hound, confined herself to one piece of the
cake which her hostess had had such pleasure in making. And Jemima wished
she had not a prophetic feeling all tea-time of the manner in which her
father would inquire into the particulars of the meal, elevating his eyebrows
at every viand named beyond plain bread-and-butter, and winding up with
some such sentence as this: "Well, I marvel how, with Benson's salary,
he can afford to keep such a table." Sally could have told of self-denial
when no one was by, when the left hand did not know what the right hand
did, on the part of both her master and mistress, practised without thinking
even to themselves that it was either a sacrifice or a virtue, in order
to enable them to help those who were in need, or even to gratify Miss
Benson's kind, old-fashioned feelings on such occasions as the present,
when a stranger came to the house. Her homely, affectionate pleasure in
making others comfortable, might have shown that such little occasional
extravagances were not waste, but a good work; and were not to be gauged
by the standard of money-spending. This evening her spirits were damped
by Jemima's refusal to eat! Poor Jemima! the cakes were so good, and she
was so hungry; but still she refused.</DD>

<DD>
While Sally was clearing away the tea-things, Miss Benson and Jemima accompanied
Ruth upstairs, when she went to put little Leonard to bed.</DD>

<DD>
"A christening is a very solemn service," said Miss Bradshaw; "I had no
idea it was so solemn. Mr. Benson seemed to speak as if he had a weight
of care on his heart that God alone could relieve or lighten."</DD>

<DD>
"My brother feels these things very much," said Miss Benson, rather wishing
to cut short the conversation, for she had been aware of several parts
in the prayer which she knew were suggested by the peculiarity and sadness
of the case before him.</DD>

<DD>
"I could not quite follow him all through," continued Jemima. "What did
he mean by saying, 'This child, rebuked by the world and bidden to stand
apart, Thou wilt not rebuke, but wilt suffer it to come to Thee and be
blessed with Thine almighty blessing'? Why is this little darling to be
rebuked? I do not think I remember the exact words, but he said something
like that."</DD>

<DD>
"My dear! your gown is dripping wet! it must have dipped into the tub;
let me wring it out."</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, thank you! Never mind my gown!" said Jemima hastily, and wanting to
return to her question; but just then she caught the sight of tears falling
fast down the cheeks of the silent Ruth as she bent over her child, crowing
and splashing away in his tub. With a sudden consciousness that unwittingly
she had touched on some painful chord, Jemima rushed into another subject,
and was eagerly seconded by Miss Benson. The circumstance seemed to die
away, and leave no trace; but in after years it rose, vivid and significant,
before Jemima's memory. At present it was enough for her, if Mrs. Denbigh
would let her serve her in every possible way. Her admiration for beauty
was keen, and little indulged at home; and Ruth was very beautiful in her
quiet mournfulness; her mean and homely dress left herself only the more
open to admiration, for she gave it a charm by her unconscious wearing
of it that made it seem like the drapery of an old Greek statue--subordinate
to the figure it covered, yet imbued by it with an unspeakable grace. Then
the pretended circumstances of her life were such as to catch the imagination
of a young romantic girl. Altogether, Jemima could have kissed her hand
and professed herself Ruth's slave. She moved away all the articles used
at this little <I>coucher</I>; she folded up Leonard's day-clothes; she
felt only too much honoured when Ruth trusted him to her for a few minutes--only
too amply rewarded when Ruth thanked her with a grave, sweet smile, and
a grateful look of her loving eyes.</DD>

<DD>
When Jemima had gone away with the servant who was sent to fetch her, there
was a little chorus of praise.</DD>

<DD>
"She's a warm-hearted girl," said Miss Benson. "She remembers all the old
days before she went to school. She is worth two of Mr. Richard. They're
each of them just the same as they were when they were children, when they
broke that window in the chapel, and he ran away home, and she came knocking
at our door with a single knock, just like a beggar's, and I went to see
who it was, and was quite startled to see her round, brown honest face
looking up at me, hall-frightened, and telling me what she had done, and
offering me the money in her savings bank to pay for it. We never should
have heard of Master Richard's share in the business if it had not been
for Sally."</DD>

<DD>
"But remember," said Mr. Benson, "how strict Mr. Bradshaw has always been
with his children. It is no wonder if poor Richard was a coward in those
days."</DD>

<DD>
"He is now, or I'm much mistaken," answered Miss Benson. "And Mr. Bradshaw
was just as strict with Jemima, and. she's no coward. But I've no faith
in Richard. He has a look about him that I don't like. And when Mr. Bradshaw
was away on business in Holland last year, for those months my young gentleman
did not come hall as regularly to chapel, and I always believe that story
of his being seen out with the hounds at Smithiles."</DD>

<DD>
"Those are neither of them great offences in a young man of twenty," said
Mr. Benson, smiling.</DD>

<DD>
"No! I don't mind them in themselves; but when he could change back so
easily to being regular and mim when his father came home, I don't like
that."</DD>

<DD>
"Leonard shall never be afraid of me," said Ruth, following her own train
of thought. "I will be his friend from the very first; and I will try and
learn how to be a wise friend, and you will teach me; won't you, sir?"</DD>

<DD>
"What made you wish to call him Leonard, Ruth?" asked Miss Benson.</DD>

<DD>
"It was my mother's father's name; and she used to tell me about him and
his goodness, and I thought if Leonard could be like him----"</DD>

<DD>
"Do you remember the discussion there was about Miss Bradshaw's name, Thurstan?
Her father wanting her to be called Hephzibah, but insisting that she was
to have a Scripture name at any rate; and Mrs. Bradshaw wanting her to
be Juliana, after some novel she had read not long before; and at last
Jemima was fixed upon, because it would do either for a Scripture name
or a name for a heroine out of a book."</DD>

<DD>
"I did not know Jemima was a Scripture name," said Ruth.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh yes, it is. One of Job's daughters; Jemima, Kezia, and Keren-Happuch.
There are a good many Jemimas in the world, and some Kezias, but I never
heard of a Keren-Happuch; and yet we know just as much of one as of another.
People really like a pretty name, whether in Scripture or out of it."</DD>

<DD>
"When there is no particular association with the name," said Mr. Benson.</DD>

<DD>
"Now, I was called Faith after the cardinal virtue; and I like my name,
though many people would think it too Puritan; that was according to our
gentle mother's pious desire. And Thurstan was called by his name because
my father wished it; for, although he was what people called a radical
and a democrat in his ways of talking and thinking, he was very proud in
his heart of being descended from some old Sir Thurstan, who figured away
in the French wars."</DD>

<DD>
"The difference between theory and practice, thinking and being," put in
Mr. Benson, who was in a mood for allowing himself a little social enjoyment.
He leaned back in his chair, with his eyes looking at, but not seeing,
the ceiling. Miss Benson was clicking away with her eternal knitting-needles,
looking at her brother, and seeing him too. Ruth was arranging her child's
clothes against the morrow. It was but their usual way of spending an evening;
the variety was given by the different tone which the conversation assumed
on the different nights. Yet, somehow, the peacefulness of the time, the
window open into the little garden, the scents that came stealing in, and
the clear summer heaven above, made the time be remembered as a happy festival
by Ruth. Even Sally seemed more placid than usual when she came in to prayers;
and she and Miss Benson followed Ruth to her bedroom, to look at the beautiful
sleeping Leonard.</DD>

<DD>
"God bless him!" said Miss Benson, stooping down to kiss his little dimpled
hand, which lay outside the coverlet, tossed abroad in the heat of the
evening.</DD>

<DD>
"Now, don't get up too early, Ruth! Injuring your health will be short-sighted
wisdom and poor economy. Good night!"</DD>

<DD>
"Good night, dear Miss Benson. Good night, Sally." When Ruth had shut her
door, she went again to the bed, and looked at her boy till her eyes filled
with tears.</DD>

<DD>
"God bless thee, darling! I only ask to be one of His instruments, and
not thrown aside as useless--or worse than useless."</DD>

<DD>
So ended the day of Leonard's christening.</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Benson had sometimes taught the children of different people as an
especial favour, when requested by them. But then his pupils were only
children, and by their progress he was little prepared for Ruth's. She
had had early teaching, of that kind which need never be unlearnt, from
her mother; enough to unfold many of her powers; they had remained inactive
now for several years, but had grown strong in the dark and quiet time.
Her tutor was surprised at the bounds by which she surmounted obstacles,
the quick perception and ready adaptation of truths and first principles,
and her immediate sense of the fitness of things. Her delight in what was
strong and beautiful called out her master's sympathy; but, most of all,
he admired the complete unconsciousness of uncommon power, or unusual progress.
It was less of a wonder than he considered it to be, it is true, for she
never thought of comparing what she was now with her former self, much
less with another. Indeed, she did not think of herself at all, but of
her boy, and what she must learn in order to teach him to be and to do
as suited her hope and her prayer. If any one's devotion could have flattered
her into self-consciousness, it was Jemima's. Mr. Bradshaw never dreamed
that his daughter could feel herself inferior to the minister's <I>protegee</I>,
but so it was; and no knight-errant of old could consider himself more
honoured by his ladye's commands than did Jemima, if Ruth allowed her to
do anything for her, or for her boy. Ruth loved her heartily, even while
she was rather annoyed at the open expression Jemima used of admiration.</DD>

<DD>
"Please, I really would rather not be told if people do think me pretty."</DD>

<DD>
"But it was not merely beautiful; it was sweet-looking and good, Mrs. Postlethwaite
called you," replied Jemima.</DD>

<DD>
"All the more I would rather not hear it. I may be pretty, but I know I
am not good. Besides, I don't think we ought to hear what is said of us
behind our backs."</DD>

<DD>
Ruth spoke so gravely, that Jemima feared lest she was displeased.</DD>

<DD>
"Dear Mrs. Denbigh, I never will admire or praise you again. Only let me
love you."</DD>

<DD>
"And let me love you!" said Ruth, with a tender kiss.</DD>

<DD>
Jemima would not have been allowed to come so frequently if Mr. Bradshaw
had not been possessed with the idea of patronising Ruth. If the latter
had chosen, she might have gone dressed from head to foot in the presents
which he wished to make her, but she refused them constantly; occasionally
to Miss Benson's great annoyance. But if he could not load her with gifts,
he could show his approbation by asking her to his house; and after some
deliberation, she consented to accompany Mr. and Miss Benson there. The
house was square and massy-looking, with a great deal of drab-colour about
the furniture. Mrs. Bradshaw, in her lackadaisical, sweet-tempered way,
seconded her husband in his desire of being kind to Ruth; and as she cherished
privately a great taste for what was beautiful or interesting, as opposed
to her husband's love of the purely useful, this taste of hers had rarely
had so healthy and true a mode of gratification as when she watched Ruth's
movements about the room, which seemed in its unobtrusiveness and poverty
of colour to receive the requisite ornament of light and splendour from
Ruth's presence. Mrs. Bradshaw sighed, and wished she had a daughter as
lovely, about whom to weave a romance; for castle-building, after the manner
of the Minerva Press, was the outlet by which she escaped from the pressure
of her prosaic life, as Mr. Bradshaw's wife. Her perception was only of
external beauty, and she was not always alive to that, or she might have
seen how a warm, affectionate, ardent nature, free from all envy or carking
care of self, gave an unspeakable charm to her plain, bright-faced daughter
Jemima, whose dark eyes kept challenging admiration for her friend. The
first evening spent at Mr. Bradshaw's passed like many succeeding visits
there. There was tea, the equipage for which was as handsome and as ugly
as money could purchase. Then the ladies produced their sewing, while Mr.
Bradshaw stood before the fire, and gave the assembled party the benefit
of his opinions on many subjects. The opinions were as good and excellent
as the opinions of any man can be who sees one side of a case very strongly,
and almost ignores the other. They coincided in many points with those
held by Mr. Benson, but he once or twice interposed with a plea for those
who might differ; and then he was heard by Mr. Bradshaw with a kind of
evident and indulgent pity, such as one feels for a child who unwittingly
talks nonsense. By-and-by Mrs. Bradshaw and Miss Benson fell into one <I>tete-a-tete</I>,
and Ruth and Jemima into another. Two well-behaved but unnaturally quiet
children were sent to bed early in the evening, in an authoritative voice,
by their father, because one of them had spoken too loud while he was enlarging
on an alteration in the tariff. Just before the supper-tray was brought
in, a gentleman was announced whom Ruth had never previously seen, but
who appeared well known to the rest of the party. It was Mr. Farquhar,
Mr. Bradshaw's partner; he had been on the Continent for the last year,
and had only recently returned. He seemed perfectly at home, but spoke
little. He leaned back in his chair, screwed up his eyes, and watched everybody;
yet there was nothing unpleasant or impertinent in his keenness of observation.
Ruth wondered to hear him contradict Mr. Bradshaw, and almost expected
some rebuff; but Mr. Bradshaw, if he did not yield the point, admitted,
for the first time that evening, that it was possible something might be
said on the other side. Mr. Farquhar differed also from Mr. Benson, but
it was in a more respectful manner than Mr. Bradshaw had done. For these
reasons, although Mr. Farquhar had never spoken to Ruth, she came away
with the impression that he was a man to be respected and perhaps liked.</DD>

<DD>
Sally would have thought herself mightily aggrieved if, on their return,
she had not heard some account of the evening. As soon as Miss Benson came
in, the old servant began--</DD>

<DD>
"Well, and who was there? and what did they give you for supper?"</DD>

<DD>
"Only Mr. Farquhar besides ourselves: and sandwiches, sponge-cake, and
wine there was no occasion for anything more," replied Miss Benson, who
was tired and preparing to go upstairs.</DD>

<DD>
"Mr. Farquhar! Why, they do say he's thinking of Miss Jemima!"</DD>

<DD>
"Nonsense, Sally! why, he's old enough to be her father!" said Miss Benson,
halfway up the first flight.</DD>

<DD>
"There's no need for it to be called nonsense, though he may be ten year
older," muttered Sally, retreating towards the kitchen. "Bradshaw's Betsy
knows what she's about, and wouldn't have said it for nothing."</DD>

<DD>
Ruth wondered a little about it. She loved Jemima well enough to be interested
in what related to her; but, after thinking for a few minutes, she decided
that such a marriage was, and would ever be, very unlikely.</DD>
