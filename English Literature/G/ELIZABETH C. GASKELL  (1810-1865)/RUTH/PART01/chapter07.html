Ruth put away every thought of the past or future; everything that could
unfit her for the duties of the present. Exceeding love supplied the place
of experience. She never left the room after the first day; she forced
herself to eat, because his service needed her strength. She did not indulge
in any tears, because the weeping she longed for would make her less able
to attend upon him. She watched, and waited, and prayed; prayed with an
utter forgetfulness of self, only with a consciousness that God was all-powerful,
and that he, whom she loved so much, needed the aid of the Mighty One.</DD>

<DD>
Day and night, the summer night, seemed merged into one. She lost count
of time in the hushed and darkened room. One morning Mrs. Morgan beckoned
her out; and she stole on tiptoe into the dazzling gallery, on one side
of which the bedrooms opened.</DD>

<DD>
"She's come," whispered Mrs. Morgan, looking very much excited, and forgetting
that Ruth had never heard that Mrs. Bellingham had been summoned.</DD>

<DD>
"Who is come?" asked Ruth. The idea of Mrs. Mason flashed through her mind--but
with a more terrible, because a more vague, dread she heard that it was
his mother; the mother of whom he had always spoken as a person whose opinion
was to be regarded more than that of any other individual.</DD>

<DD>
"What must I do? Will she be angry with me?" said she, relapsing into her
child-like dependence on others; and feeling that even Mrs. Morgan was
some one to stand between her and Mrs. Bellingham.</DD>

<DD>
Mrs. Morgan herself was a little perplexed. Her morality was rather shocked
at the idea of a proper real lady like Mrs. Bellingham discovering that
she had winked at the connection between her son and Ruth. She was quite
inclined to encourage Ruth in her inclination to shrink out of Mrs. Bellingham's
observation, an inclination which arose from no definite consciousness
of having done wrong, but principally from the representations she had
always heard of the lady's awfulness. Mrs. Bellingham swept into her son's
room as if she were unconscious what poor young creature had lately haunted
it; while Ruth hurried into some unoccupied bedroom, and, alone there,
she felt her self-restraint suddenly give way, and burst into the saddest,
most utterly wretched weeping she had ever known. She was worn out with
watching, and exhausted by passionate crying, and she lay down on the bed
and fell asleep. The day passed on; she slumbered unnoticed and unregarded;
she awoke late in the evening with a sense of having done wrong in sleeping
so long; the strain upon her responsibility had not yet left her. Twilight
was closing fast around; she waited until it had become night, and then
she stole down to Mrs. Morgan's parlour.</DD>

<DD>
"If you please, may I come in?" asked she.</DD>

<DD>
Jenny Morgan was doing up the hieroglyphics which she called her accounts;
she answered sharp enough, but it was a permission to enter, and Ruth was
thankful for it.</DD>

<DD>
"Will you tell me how he is? Do you think I may go back to him?"</DD>

<DD>
"No, indeed, that you may not. Nest, who has made his room tidy these many
days, is not fit to go in now. Mrs. Bellingham has brought her own maid,
and the family nurse and Mr. Bellingham's man; such a tribe of servants,
and no end to packages; water-beds coming by the carrier, and a doctor
from London coming down to-morrow, as if feather-beds and Mr. Jones was
not good enough. Why, she won't let a soul of us into the room; there's
no chance for you!"</DD>

<DD>
Ruth sighed. "How is he?" she inquired, after a pause.</DD>

<DD>
"How can I tell, indeed, when I am not allowed to go near him? Mr. Jones
said to-night was a turning-point; but I doubt it, for it is four days
since he was taken ill, and who ever heard of a sick person taking a turn
on an even number of days? It's alway on the third, or the fifth, or seventh,
or so on. He'll not turn till to-morrow night, take my word for it, and
their fine London doctor will get all the credit, and honest Mr. Jones
will be thrown aside. I don't think he will get better myself, though--Gelert
does not howl for nothing. My patience what's the matter with the girl?--Lord,
child, you're never going to faint, and be ill on my hands?" Her sharp
voice recalled Ruth from the sick unconsciousness that had been creeping
over her as she listened to the latter part of this speech. She sat down
and could not speak--the room whirled round and round--her white feebleness
touched Mrs. Morgan's heart.</DD>

<DD>
"You've had no tea, I guess. Indeed, and the girls are very careless."
She rang the bell with energy, and seconded her pull by going to the door
and shouting out sharp directions, in Welsh, to Nest and Gwen, and three
or four other rough, kind, slatternly servants.</DD>

<DD>
They brought her tea, which was comfortable, according to the idea of comfort
prevalent in that rude hospitable place; there was plenty to eat; too much
indeed, for it revolted the appetite it was intended to provoke. But the
heartiness with which the kind rosy waiter pressed her to eat, and the
scolding Mrs. Morgan gave her when she found the buttered toast untouched
(toast on which she had herself desired that the butter might not be spared),
did Ruth more good than the tea. She began to hope, and to long for the
morning when hope might have become certainty. It was all in vain that
she was told that the room she had been in all day was at her service;
she did not say a word, but she was not going to bed that night of all
nights in the year, when life or death hung trembling in the balance. She
went into the bedroom till the bustling house was still, and heard busy
feet passing to and fro into the room she might not enter; and voices,
imperious, though hushed down to awhisper, ask for innumerable things.
Then there was silence: and when she thought that all were dead asleep,
except the watchers, she stole out into the gallery. On the other side
were two windows, cut into the thick stone wall, and flower-pots were placed
on the shelves thus formed, where great untrimmed, straggling geraniums
grew, and strove to reach the light. The window near Mr. Bellingham's door
was open; the soft, warm-scented night-air came sighing in in faint gusts,
and then was still. It was summer; there was no black darkness in the twenty-four
hours; only the light grew dusky, and colour disappeared from objects,
of which the shape and form remained distinct. A soft grey oblong of barred
light fell on the flat wall opposite to the windows, and deeper grey shadows
marked out the tracery of the plants, more graceful thus than in reality.
Ruth crouched where no light fell. She sat on the ground close by the door;
her whole existence was absorbed in listening: all was still; it was only
her heart beating with the strong, heavy, regular sound of a hammer. She
wished she could stop its rushing, incessant clang. She heard a rustle
of a silken gown, and knew it ought not to have been worn in a sick-room;
for her senses seemed to have passed into the keeping of the invalid, and
to feel only as he felt. The noise was probably occasioned by some change
of posture in the watcher inside, for it was once more dead-still. The
soft wind outside sank with a low, long, distant moan among the windings
of the hills, and lost itself there, and came no more again. But Ruth's
heart beat loud. She rose with as little noise as if she were a vision,
and crept to the open window to try and lose the nervous listening for
the ever-recurring sound. Out beyond, under the calm sky, veiled with a
mist rather than with a cloud, rose the high, dark outlines of the mountains,
shutting in that village as if it lay in a nest. They stood, like giants,
solemnly watching for the end of Earth and Time. Here and there a black
round shadow reminded Ruth of some "Cwm," or hollow, where she and her
lover had rambled in sun and in gladness. She then thought the land enchanted
into everlasting brightness and happiness; she fancied, then, that into
a region so lovely no bale or woe could enter, but would be charmed away
and disappear before the sight of the glorious guardian mountains. Now
she knew the truth, that earth has no barrier which avails against agony.
It comes lightning-like down from heaven, into the mountain house and the
town garret; into the palace and into the cottage. The garden lay close
under the house; a bright spot enough by day; for in that soil, whatever
was planted grew and blossomed in spite of neglect. The white roses glimmered
out in the dusk all the night through; the red were lost in shadow. Between
the low boundary of the garden and the hills swept one or two green meadows;
Ruth looked into the grey darkness till she traced each separate wave of
outline. Then she heard a little restless bird chirp out its wakefulness
from a nest in the ivy round the walls of the house. But the mother-bird
spread her soft feathers, and hushed it into silence. Presently, however,
many little birds began to scent the coming dawn, and rustled among the
leaves, and chirruped loud and clear. Just above the horizon, too, the
mist became a silvery grey cloud hanging on the edge of the world; presently
it turned shimmering white; and then, in an instant, it flushed into rose,
and the mountain-tops sprang into heaven, and bathed in the presence of
the shadow of God. With a bound, the sun of a molten fiery red came above
the horizon, and immediately thousands of little birds sang out for joy,
and a soft chorus of mysterious, glad murmurs came forth from the earth;
the low whispering wind left its hiding-place among the clefts and hollows
of the hills, and wandered among the rustling herbs and trees, waking the
flower-buds to the life of another day. Ruth gave a sigh of relief that
the night was over and gone; for she knew that soon suspense would be ended,
and the verdict known, whether for life or for death. She grew faint and
sick with anxiety; it almost seemed as if she must go into the room and
learn the truth. Then she heard movements, but they were not sharp nor
rapid, as if prompted by any emergency; then, again, it was still. She
sat curled up upon the floor, with her head thrown back against the wall,
and her hands clasped round her knees. She had yet to wait. Meanwhile,
the invalid was slowly rousing himself from a long, deep, sound, health-giving
sleep. His mother had sat by him the night through, and was now daring
to change her position for the first time; she was even venturing to give
directions in a low voice to the old nurse, who had dozed away in an arm-chair,
ready to obey any summons of her mistress. Mrs. Bellingham went on tiptoe
towards the door, and chiding herself because her stiff, weary limbs made
some slight noise. She had an irrepressible longing for a few minutes'
change of scene after her night of watching. She felt that the crisis was
over; and the relief to her mind made her conscious of every bodily feeling
and irritation, which had passed unheeded as long as she had been in suspense.</DD>

<DD>
She slowly opened the door. Ruth sprang upright at the first sound of the
creaking handle. Her very lips were stiff and unpliable with the force
of the blood which rushed to her head. It seemed as if she could not form
words. She stood right before Mrs. Bellingham. "How is he, madam?"</DD>

<DD>
Mrs. Bellingham was for a moment surprised at the white apparition which
seemed to rise out of the ground. But her quick, proud mind understood
it all in an instant. This was the girl, then, whose profligacy had led
her son astray; had raised up barriers in the way of her favourite scheme
of his marriage with Miss Duncombe; nay, this was the real cause of his
illness, his mortal danger at this present time, and of her bitter, keen
anxiety. If, under any circumstances, Mrs. Bellingham could have been guilty
of the ill-breeding of not answering a question, it was now; and for a
moment she was tempted to pass on in silence. Ruth could not wait; she
spoke again--</DD>

<DD>
"For the love of God, madam, speak! How is he? Will he live?"</DD>

<DD>
If she did not answer her, she thought the creature was desperate enough
to force her way into his room. So she spoke--</DD>

<DD>
"He has slept well: he is better."</DD>

<DD>
"Oh! my God, I thank thee," murmured Ruth, sinking back against the wall.</DD>

<DD>
It was too much to hear this wretched girl thanking God for her son's life;
as if, in fact, she had any lot or part in him. And to dare to speak to
the Almighty on her son's behalf! Mrs. Bellingham looked at her with cold,
contemptuous eyes, whose glances were like ice-bolts, and made Ruth shiver
up away from them.</DD>

<DD>
"Young woman, if you have any propriety or decency left, I trust that you
will not dare to force yourself into his room."</DD>

<DD>
She stood for a moment as if awaiting an answer, and half expecting it
to be a defiance. But she did not understand Ruth. She did not imagine
the faithful trustfulness of her heart. Ruth believed that, if Mr. Bellingham
was alive and likely to live, all was well. When he wanted her, he would
send for her, ask for her, yearn for her, till every one would yield before
his steadfast will. At present she imagined that he was probably too weak
to care or know who was about him; and though it would have been an infinite
delight to her to hover and brood around him, yet it was of him she thought
and not of herself. She gently drew herself on one side to make way for
Mrs. Bellingham to pass.</DD>

<DD>
By and by Mrs. Morgan came up. Ruth was still near the door, from which
it seemed as if she could not tear herself away.</DD>

<DD>
"Indeed, miss, and you must not hang about the door in this way; it is
not pretty manners. Mrs. Bellingham has been speaking very sharp and cross
about it, and I shall lose the character of my inn if people take to talking
as she does. Did I not give you a room last night to keep in, and never
be seen or heard of; and did I not tell you what a particular lady Mrs.
Bellingham was, but you must come out here right in her way? Indeed, it
was not pretty, nor grateful to me, Jenny Morgan, and that I must say."</DD>

<DD>
Ruth turned away like a chidden child. Mrs. Morgan followed her to her
room, scolding as she went; and then, having cleared her heart after her
wont by uttering hasty words, her real kindness made her add, in a softened
tone--</DD>

<DD>
"You stop up here like a good girl. I'll send you your breakfast by-and-by,
and let you know from time to time how he is; and you can go out for a
walk, you know: but if you do, I'll take it as a favour if you'll go out
by the side-door. It will, maybe, save scandal."</DD>

<DD>
All that day long, Ruth kept herself close prisoner in the room to which
Mrs. Morgan accorded her; all that day, and many succeeding days. But at
nights, when the house was still, and even the little brown mice had gathered
up the crumbs, and darted again to their holes, Ruth stole out, and crept
to his door to catch, if she could, the sound of his beloved voice. She
could tell by its tones how he felt, and how he was getting on, as well
as any of the watchers in the room. She yearned and pined to see him once
more; but she had reasoned herself down into something like patience. When
he was well enough to leave his room, when he had not always one of the
nurses with him, then he would send for her, and she would tell him how
very patient she had been for his dear sake. But it was long to wait, even
with this thought of the manner in which the waiting would end. Poor Ruth!
her faith was only building up vain castles in the air; they towered up
into heaven, it is true; but, after all, they were but visions.</DD>
