<DD>
It was no wonder that the lookers-on were perplexed as to the state of
affairs between Jemima and Mr. Farquhar, for they two were sorely puzzled
themselves at the sort of relationship between them. Was it love, or was
it not? that was the question in Mr. Farquhar's mind. He hoped it was not;
he believed it was not; and yet he felt as if it were. There was something
preposterous, he thought, in a man nearly forty years of age being in love
with a girl of twenty. He had gone on reasoning, through all the days of
his manhood, on the idea of a staid, noble-minded wife, grave and sedate,
the fit companion in experience of her husband. He had spoken with admiration
of reticent characters, full of self-control and dignity; and he hoped--he
trusted, that all this time he had not been allowing himself unconsciously
to fall in love with a wild-hearted, impetuous girl, who knew nothing of
life beyond her father's house, and who chafed under the strict discipline
enforced there. For it was rather a suspicious symptom of the state of
Mr. Farquhar's affections, that he had discovered the silent rebellion
which continued in Jemima's heart, unperceived by any of her own family,
against the severe laws and opinions of her father. Mr. Farquhar shared
in these opinions; but in him they were modified, and took a milder form.
Still, he approved of much that Mr. Bradshaw did and said; and this made
it all the more strange that he should wince so for Jemima, whenever anything
took place which he instinctively knew that she would dislike. After an
evening at Mr. Bradshaw's, when Jemima had gone to the very verge of questioning
or disputing some of her father's severe judgments, Mr. Farquhar went home
in a dissatisfied, restless state of mind, which he was almost afraid to
analyse. He admired the inflexible integrity--and almost the pomp of principle--evinced
by Mr. Bradshaw on every occasion; he wondered how it was that Jemima could
not see how grand a life might be, whose every action was shaped in obedience
to some eternal law; instead of which, he was afraid she rebelled against
every law, and was only guided by impulse. Mr. Farquhar had been taught
to dread impulses as promptings of the devil. Sometimes, if he tried to
present her father's opinion before her in another form, so as to bring
himself and her rather more into that state of agreement he longed for,
she flashed out upon him with the indignation of difference that she dared
not show to, or before, her father, as if she had some diviner instinct
which taught her more truly than they knew, with all their experience;
at least, in her first expressions there seemed something good and fine;
but opposition made her angry and irritable, and the arguments which he
was constantly provoking (whenever he was with her in her father's absence)
frequently ended in some vehemence of expression on her part that offended
Mr. Farquhar, who did not see how she expiated her anger in tears and self-reproaches
when alone in her chamber. Then he would lecture himself severely on the
interest he could not help feeling in a wilful girl; he would determine
not to interfere with her opinions in future, and yet, the very next time
they differed, he strove to argue her into harmony with himself, in spite
of all resolutions to the contrary.</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Bradshaw saw just enough of this interest which Jemima had excited
in his partner's mind, to determine him in considering their future marriage
as a settled affair. The fitness of the thing had long ago struck him;
her father's partner--so the fortune he meant to give her might continue
in the business; a man of such steadiness of character, and such a capital
eye for a desirable speculation, as Mr. Farquhar--just the right age to
unite the paternal with the conjugal affection, and consequently the very
man for Jemima, who had something unruly in her, which might break out
under a <I>regime</I> less wisely adjusted to the circumstances than was
Mr. Bradshaw's (in his own opinion)--a house ready furnished, at a convenient
distance from her home--no near relations on Mr. Farquhar's side, who might
be inclined to consider his residence as their own for an indefinite time,
and so add to the household expenses--in short, what could be more suitable
in every way? Mr. Bradshaw respected the very self-restraint he thought
he saw in Mr. Farquhar's demeanour, attributing it to a wise desire to
wait until trade should be rather more slack, and the man of business more
at leisure to become the lover.</DD>

<DD>
As for Jemima, at times she thought she almost hated Mr. Farquhar.</DD>

<DD>
"What business has he," she would think, "to lecture me? Often I can hardly
bear it from papa, and I will not bear it from him. He treats me just like
a child, and as if I should lose all my present opinions when I know more
of the world. I am sure I should like never to know the world, if it was
to make me think as he does, hard man that he is! I wonder what made him
take Jem Brown on as gardener again, if he does not believe that above
one criminal in a thousand is restored to goodness. I'll ask him, some
day, if that was not acting on impulse rather than principle. Poor impulse!
how you do get abused! But I will tell Mr. Farquhar I will not let him
interfere with me. If I do what papa bids me, no one has a right to notice
whether I do it willingly or not."</DD>

<DD>
So then she tried to defy Mr. Farquhar, by doing and saying things that
she knew he would disapprove. She went so far that he was seriously grieved,
and did not even remonstrate and "lecture," and then she was disappointed
and irritated; for, somehow, with all her indignation at interference,
she liked to be lectured by him; not that she was aware of this liking
of hers, but still it would have been more pleasant to be scolded than
so quietly passed over. Her two little sisters, with their wide-awake eyes,
had long ago put things together, and conjectured. Every day they had some
fresh mystery together, to be imparted in garden walks and whispered talks.</DD>

<DD>
"Lizzie, did you see how the tears came into Mimie's eyes when Mr. Farquhar
looked so displeased when she said good people were always dull? I think
she's in love." Mary said the last words with grave emphasis, and felt
like an oracle of twelve years of age.</DD>

<DD>
"I don't," said Lizzie. "I know I cry often enough when papa is cross,
and I'm not in love with him."</DD>

<DD>
"Yes! but you don't look as Mimie did."</DD>

<DD>
"Don't call her Mimie--you know papa does not like it?"</DD>

<DD>
"Yes; but there are so many things papa does not like I can never remember
them all. Never mind about that; but listen to something I've got to tell
you, if you'll never, never tell."</DD>

<DD>
"No, indeed I won't, Mary. What is it?"</DD>

<DD>
"Not to Mrs. Denbigh?"</DD>

<DD>
"No, not even to Mrs. Denbigh."</DD>

<DD>
"Well, then, the other day--last Friday, Mimie----"</DD>

<DD>
"Jemima!" interrupted the more conscientious Elizabeth.</DD>

<DD>
"Jemima, if it must be so," jerked out Mary, "sent me to her desk for an
envelope, and what do you. think I saw?"</DD>

<DD>
"What?" asked Elizabeth, expecting nothing else than a red-hot Valentine,
signed Walter Farquhar, pro Bradshaw, Farquhar, &amp; Co., in full.</DD>

<DD>
"Why, a piece of paper, with dull-looking lines upon it, just like the
scientific dialogues; and I remember all about it. It was once when Mr.
Farquhar had been telling us that a bullet does not go in a straight line,
but in a something curve, and he drew some lines on a piece of paper; and
Mimie----"</DD>

<DD>
"Jemima!" put in Elizabeth.</DD>

<DD>
"Well, well! She had treasured it up, and written in corner, 'W. F., April
3rd.' Now, that's rather like love, is not it? For Jemima hates useful
information just as much as I do, and that's saying a great deal; and yet
she had kept this paper, and dated it."</DD>

<DD>
"If that's all, I know Dick keeps a paper with Miss Benson's name written
on it, and yet he's not in love with her; and perhaps Jemima may like Mr.
Farquhar, and he may not like her. It seems such a little while since her
hair was turned up, and he has always been a grave, middle-aged man ever
since I can recollect; and then, have you never noticed how often he finds
fault with her--almost lectures her?"</DD>

<DD>
"To be sure," said Mary; " but he may be in love, for all that. Just think
how often papa lectures mamma; and yet, of course, they're in love with
each other."</DD>

<DD>
"Well! we shall see," said Elizabeth.</DD>

<DD>
Poor Jemima little thought of the four sharp eyes that watched her daily
course while she sat alone, as she fancied, with her secret in her own
room. For, in a passionate fit of grieving, at the impatient, hasty temper
which had made her so seriously displease Mr. Farquhar that he had gone
away without remonstrance, without more leave-taking than a distant bow,
she had begun to suspect that, rather than not be noticed at all by him,
rather than be an object of indifference to him--oh! far rather would she
be an object of anger and upbraiding; and the thoughts that followed this
confession to herself stunned and bewildered her; and for once that they
made her dizzy with hope, ten times they made her sick with fear. For an
instant she planned to become and to be all he could wish her; to change
her very nature for him. And then a great gush of pride came over her,
and she set her teeth tight together, and determined that he should either
love her as she was or not at all. Unless he could take her with all her
faults, she would not care for his regard; "love" was too noble a word
to call such cold, calculating feeling as his must be, who went about with
a pattern idea in his mind, trying to find a wife to match. Besides, there
was something degrading, Jemima thought, in trying to alter herself to
gain the love of any human creature. And yet, if he did not care for her,
if this late indifference were to last, what a great shroud was drawn over
life! Could she bear it?</DD>

<DD>
From the agony she dared not look at, but which she was going to risk encountering,
she was aroused by the presence of her mother.</DD>

<DD>
"Jemima! your father wants to speak to you in the dining-room."</DD>

<DD>
"What for?" asked the girl.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh! he is fidgeted by something Mr. Farquhar said to me and which I repeated.
I am sure I thought there was no harm in it, and your father always likes
me to tell him what everybody says in his absence."</DD>

<DD>
Jemima went with a heavy heart into her father's presence.</DD>

<DD>
He was walking up and down the room, and did not see her at first.</DD>

<DD>
"O Jemima! is that you? Has your mother told you what I want to speak to
you about?"</DD>

<DD>
"No!" said Jemima. "Not exactly."</DD>

<DD>
"She has been telling me what proves to me how very seriously you must
have displeased and offended Mr. Farquhar, before he could have expressed
himself to her as he did, when he left the house. You know what he said?"</DD>

<DD>
"No!" said Jemima, her heart swelling within her. "He has no right to say
anything about me." She was desperate, or she durst not have said this
before her father.</DD>

<DD>
"No right!--what do you mean, Jemima?" said Mr. Bradshaw, turning sharp
round. "Surely you must know that I hope he may one day be your husband;
that is to say, if you prove yourself worthy of the excellent training
I have given you. I cannot suppose Mr. Farquhar would take any undisciplined
girl as a wife."</DD>

<DD>
Jemima held tight by a chair near which she was standing. She did not speak;
her father was pleased by her silence--it was the way in which he liked
his projects to be received.</DD>

<DD>
"But you cannot suppose," he continued, "that Mr. Farquhar will consent
to marry you----"</DD>

<DD>
"Consent to marry me!" repeated Jemima, in a low tone of brooding indignation;
were those the terms upon which her rich woman's heart was to be given,
with a calm consent of acquiescent acceptance, but a little above resignation
on the part of the receiver?</DD>

<DD>
--"if you give way to a temper which, although you have never dared to
show it to me, I am well aware exists, although I hoped the habits of self-examination
I had instilled had done much to cure you of manifesting it. At one time,
Richard promised to be the more headstrong of the two; now, I must desire
you to take pattern by him. Yes," he continued, falling into his old train
of thought, "it would be a most fortunate connection for you in every way.
I should have you under my own eye, and could still assist you in the formation
of your character, and I should be at hand to strengthen and confirm your
principles. Mr. Farquhar's connection with the firm would be convenient
and agreeable to me in a pecuniary point of view. He----" Mr. Bradshaw
was going on in his enumeration of the advantages which he in particular,
and Jemima in the second place, would derive from this marriage, when his
daughter spoke, at first so low that he could not hear her, as he walked
up and down the room with his creaking boots, and he had to stop to listen.</DD>

<DD>
"Has Mr. Farquhar ever spoken to you about it?" Jemima's cheek was flushed
as she asked the question; she wished that she might have been the person
to whom he had first addressed himself.</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Bradshaw answered--</DD>

<DD>
"No, not spoken. It has been implied between us for some time. At least,
I have been so aware of his intentions that I have made several allusions,
in the course of business, to it, as a thing that might take place. He
can hardly have misunderstood; he must have seen that I perceived his design,
and approved of it," said Mr. Bradshaw, rather doubtfully; as he remembered
how very little, in fact, passed between him and his partner which could
have reference to the subject, to any but a mind prepared to receive it.
Perhaps Mr. Farquhar had not really thought of it; but then again, that
would imply that his own penetration had been mistaken, a thing not impossible
certainly, but quite beyond the range of probability. So he reassured himself,
and (as he thought) his daughter, by saying--</DD>

<DD>
"The whole thing is so suitable--the advantages arising from the connection
are so obvious; besides which, I am quite aware, from many little speeches
of Mr. Farquhar's, that he contemplates marriage at no very distant time;
and he seldom leaves Eccleston, and visits few families besides our own--certainly,
none that can compare with ours in the advantages you have all received
in moral and religious training." But then Mr. Bradshaw was checked in
his implied praises of himself (and only himself could be his martingale
when he once set out on such a career) by a recollection that Jemima must
not feel too secure, as she might become if he dwelt too much on the advantages
of her being her father's daughter. Accordingly, he said, "But you must
be aware, Jemima, that you do very little credit to the education I have
given you, when you make such an impression as you must have done to-day,
before Mr. Farquhar could have said what. he did of you!"</DD>

<DD>
"What did he say?" asked Jemima, still in the low, husky tone of suppressed
anger.</DD>

<DD>
"Your mother says he remarked to her, 'What a pity it is that Jemima cannot
maintain her opinions without going into a passion; and what a pity it
is that her opinions are such as to sanction, rather than curb, these fits
of rudeness and anger!'"</DD>

<DD>
"Did he say that?" said Jemima, in a still lower tone, not questioning
her father, but speaking rather to herself.</DD>

<DD>
"I have no doubt he did," replied her father gravely. "Your mother is in
the habit of repeating accurately to me what takes place in my absence;
besides which, the whole speech is not one of hers; she has not altered
a word in the repetition, I am convinced. I have trained her to habits
of accuracy very unusual in a woman."</DD>

<DD>
At another time, Jemima might have been inclined to rebel against this
system of carrying constant intelligence to headquarters, which she had
long ago felt as an insurmountable obstacle to any free communication with
her mother; but now, her father's means of acquiring knowledge faded into
insignificance before the nature of the information he imparted. She stood
quite still, grasping the chair-back, longing to be dismissed.</DD>

<DD>
"I have said enough now, I hope, to make you behave in a becoming manner
to Mr. Farquhar; if your temper is too unruly to be always under your own
control, at least have respect to my injunctions, and take some pains to
curb it before him."</DD>

<DD>
"May I go?" asked Jemima, chafing more and more.</DD>

<DD>
"You may," said her father. When she left the room be gently rubbed his
hands together, satisfied with the effect he had produced, and wondering
how it was that one so well brought up as his daughter could ever say or
do anything to provoke such a remark from Mr. Farquhar as that which he
had heard repeated.</DD>

<DD>
"Nothing can be more gentle and docile than she is when spoken to in the
proper manner. I must give Farquhar a hint," said Mr. Bradshaw to himself.</DD>

<DD>
Jemima rushed upstairs and locked herself into her room. She began pacing
up and down at first, without shedding a tear; but then she suddenly stopped,
and burst out crying with passionate indignation.</DD>

<DD>
"So! I am to behave well, not because it is right--not because it is right--but
to show off before Mr. Farquhar. Oh, Mr. Farquhar!" said she, suddenly
changing to a sort of upbraiding tone of voice, "I did not think so of
you an hour ago. I did not think you could choose a wife in that cold-hearted
way, though you did profess to act by rule and line; but you think to have
me, do you? because it is fitting and suitable, and you want to be married,
and can't spare time for wooing" (she was lashing herself up by an exaggeration
of all her father had said). "And bow often I have thought you were too
grand for me! but now I know better. Now I can believe that all you do
is done from calculation; you are good because it adds to your business
credit--you talk in that high strain about principle because it sounds
well, and is respectable--and even these things are better than your cold
way of looking out for a wife, just as you would do for a carpet, to add
to your comforts, and settle you respectably. But I won't be that wife.
You shall see something of me which shall make you not acquiesce so quietly
in the arrangements of the firm." She cried too vehemently to go on thinking
or speaking. Then she stopped, and said--</DD>

<DD>
"Only an hour ago I was hoping--I don't know what I was hoping--but I thought--oh!
how I was deceived!--I thought he had a true, deep, loving manly heart,
which God might let me win; but now I know he has only a calm, calculating
head----"</DD>

<DD>
If Jemima had been vehement and passionate before this conversation with
her father, it was better than the sullen reserve she assumed now whenever
Mr. Farquhar came to the house. He felt it deeply; no reasoning with himself
took off the pain he experienced. He tried to speak on the subjects she
liked, in the manner she liked, until he despised himself for the unsuccessful
efforts.</DD>

<DD>
He stood between her and her father once or twice, in obvious inconsistency
with his own previously expressed opinions; and Mr. Bradshaw piqued himself
upon his admirable management, in making Jemima feel that she owed his
indulgence or forbearance to Mr. Farquhar's interference; but Jemima--perverse,
miserable Jemima--thought that she hated Mr. Farquhar all the more. She
respected her father inflexible, much more than her father pompously giving
up to Mr. Farquhar's subdued remonstrances on her behalf. Even Mr. Bradshaw
was perplexed, and shut himself up to consider how Jemima was to be made
more fully to understand his wishes and her own interests. But there was
nothing to take hold of as a ground for any further conversation with her.
Her actions were so submissive that they were spiritless; she did all her
father desired; she did it with a nervous quickness and haste, if she thought
that otherwise Mr. Farquhar would interfere in any way. She wished evidently
to owe nothing to him. She had begun by leaving the room when he came in,
after the conversation she had had with her father; but at Mr. Bradshaw's
first expression of his wish that she should remain, she remained--silent,
indifferent, inattentive to all that was going on; at least there was this
appearance of inattention. She would work away at her sewing as if she
were to earn her livelihood by it; the light was gone out of her eyes as
she lifted them up heavily before replying to any question, and the eyelids
were often swollen with crying.</DD>

<DD>
But in all this there was no positive fault. Mr. Bradshaw could not have
told her not to do this, or to do that, without her doing it; for she had
become much more docile of late.</DD>

<DD>
It was a wonderful proof of the influence Ruth had gained in the family,
that Mr. Bradshaw, after much deliberation, congratulated himself on the
wise determination he had made of requesting her to speak to Jemima, and
find out what feeling was at the bottom of all this change in her ways
of going on.</DD>

<DD>
He rang the bell.</DD>

<DD>
"Is Mrs. Denbigh here?" he inquired of the servant who answered it.</DD>

<DD>
"Yes, sir; she has just come."</DD>

<DD>
"Beg her to come to me in this room as soon as she can leave the young
ladies."</DD>

<DD>
Ruth came.</DD>

<DD>
"Sit down, Mrs. Denbigh; sit down. I want to have a little conversation
with you; not about your pupils; they are going on well under your care,
I am sure; and I often congratulate myself on the choice I made--I assure
you I do. But now I want to speak to you about Jemima. She is very fond
of you, and perhaps you could take an opportunity of observing to her--in
short, of saying to her, that she is behaving very foolishly--in fact,
disgusting Mr. Farquhar (who was, I know, inclined to like her) by the
sullen, sulky way she behaves in, when he is by."</DD>

<DD>
He paused for the ready acquiescence he expected. But Ruth did not quite
comprehend what was required of her, and disliked the glimpse she had gained
of the task very much.</DD>

<DD>
"I hardly understand, sir. You are displeased with Miss Bradshaw's manners
to Mr. Farquhar."</DD>

<DD>
"Well, well! not quite that; I am displeased with her manners--they are
sulky and abrupt, particularly when he is by--and I want you (of whom she
is so fond) to speak to her about it."</DD>

<DD>
"But I have never had the opportunity of noticing them. Whenever I have
seen her, she has been most gentle and affectionate."</DD>

<DD>
"But I think you do not hesitate to believe me when I say that I have noticed
the reverse," said Mr. Bradshaw, drawing himself up.</DD>

<DD>
"No, sir. I beg your pardon if I have expressed myself so badly as to seem
to doubt. But am I to tell Miss Bradshaw that you have spoken of her faults
to me?" asked Ruth, a little astonished, and shrinking more than ever from
the proposed task.</DD>

<DD>
"If you would allow me to finish what I have got to say, without interruption,
I could then tell you what I do wish."</DD>

<DD>
"I beg your pardon, sir," said Ruth gently.</DD>

<DD>
"I wish you to join our circle occasionally in an evening; Mrs. Bradshaw
shall send you an invitation when Mr. Farquhar is likely to be here. Warned
by me, and, consequently, with your observation quickened, you can hardly
fail to notice instances of what I have pointed out; and then I will trust
to your own good sense" (Mr. Bradshaw bowed to her at this part of his
sentence) "to find an opportunity to remonstrate with her."</DD>

<DD>
Ruth was beginning to speak, but he waved his hand for another minute of
silence.</DD>

<DD>
"Only a minute, Mrs. Denbigh. I am quite aware that, in requesting your
presence occasionally in the evening, I shall be trespassing upon the time
which is, in fact, your money; you may be assured that I shall not forget
this little circumstance, and you can explain what I have said on this
head to Benson and his sister."</DD>

<DD>
"I am afraid I cannot do it," Ruth began; but, while she was choosing words
delicate enough to express her reluctance to act as he wished, he had almost
bowed her out of the room; and thinking that she was modest in her estimate
of her qualifications for remonstrating with his daughter, he added, blandly--</DD>

<DD>
"No one so able, Mrs. Denbigh. I have observed many qualities in you--observed
when, perhaps, you have little thought it."</DD>

<DD>
If he had observed Ruth that morning he would have seen an absence of mind
and depression of spirits not much to her credit as a teacher; for she
could not bring herself to feel that she had any right to go into the family
purposely to watch over and find fault with any one member of it. If she
had seen anything wrong in Jemima, Ruth loved her so much that she would
have told her of it in private; and with many doubts, how far she was the
one to pull out the mote from any one's eye, even in the most tender manner;--she
would have had to conquer reluctance before she could have done even this;
but there was something indefinably repugnant to her in the manner of acting
which Mr. Bradshaw had proposed, and she determined not to accept the invitations
which were to place her in so false a position.</DD>

<DD>
But as she was leaving the house, after the end of the lessons, while she
stood in the hall tying on her bonnet, and listening to the last small
confidences of her two pupils, she saw Jemima coming in through the garden-door,
and was struck by the change in her looks. The large eyes, so brilliant
once, were dim and clouded; the complexion sallow and colourless; a lowering
expression was on the dark brow, and the corners of her mouth drooped as
with sorrowful thoughts. She looked up, and her eyes met Ruth's.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh! you beautiful creature!" thought Jemima, "with your still, calm, heavenly
face, what are you to know of earth's trials? You have lost your beloved
by death--but that is a blessed sorrow; the sorrow I have pulls me down
and down, and makes me despise and hate every one--not you, though." And,
her face changing to a soft, tender look, she went up to Ruth and kissed
her fondly; as if it were a relief to be near some one on whose true, pure
heart she relied. Ruth returned the caress; and even while she did so,
she suddenly rescinded her resolution to keep clear of what Mr. Bradshaw
had desired her to do. On her way home she resolved, if she could, to find
out what were Jemima's secret feelings; and if (as, from some previous
knowledge, she suspected) they were morbid and exaggerated in any way,
to try and help her right with all the wisdom which true love gives. It
was time that some one should come to still the storm in Jemima's turbulent
heart, which was daily and hourly knowing less and less of peace. The irritating
difficulty was to separate the two characters, which at two different times
she had attributed to Mr. Farquhar--the old one, which she had formerly
believed to be true, that he was a man acting up to a high standard of
lofty principle, and acting up without a struggle (and this last had been
the circumstance which had made her rebellious and irritable once); the
new one, which her father had excited in her suspicious mind, that Mr.
Farquhar was cold and calculating in all he did, and that she was to be
transferred by the former, and accepted by the latter, as a sort of stock-in-trade--these
were the two Mr. Farquhars who clashed together in her mind. And in this
state of irritation and prejudice, she could not bear the way in which
he gave up his opinions to please her; that was not the way to win her;
she liked him far better when he inflexibly and rigidly adhered to Ills
idea of right and wrong, not even allowing any force to temptation, and
hardly any grace to repentance, compared with that beauty of holiness which
had never yielded to sin. He had been her idol in those days, as she found
out now, however much at the time she had opposed him with violence.</DD>

<DD>
As for Mr. Farquhar, he was almost weary of himself; no reasoning, even
no principle, seemed to have influence over him, for he saw that Jemima
was not at all what he approved of in woman. He saw her uncurbed and passionate,
affecting to despise the rules of life he held most sacred, and indifferent
to, if not positively disliking, him; and yet he loved her dearly. But
he resolved to make a great effort of will, and break loose from these
trammels of sense. And while he resolved, some old recollection would bring
her up, hanging on his arm, in all the confidence of early girlhood, looking
up in his face with her soft, dark eyes, and questioning him upon the mysterious
subjects which had so much interest for both of them at that time, although
they had become only matter for dissension in these later days.</DD>

<DD>
It was also true, as Mr. Bradshaw had said, Mr. Farquhar wished to marry,
and had not much choice in the small town of Eccleston. He never put this
so plainly before himself, as a reason for choosing Jemima, as her father
had done to her; but it was an unconscious motive all the same. However,
now he had lectured himself into the resolution to make a pretty long absence
from Eccleston, and see if, amongst his distant friends, there was no woman
more in accordance with his ideal, who could put the naughty, wilful, plaguing
Jemima Bradshaw out of his head, if he did not soon perceive some change
in her for the better.</DD>

<DD>
A few days after Ruth's conversation with Mr. Bradshaw the invitation she
had been expecting, yet dreading, came. It was to her alone. Mr. and Miss
Benson were pleased at the compliment to her, and urged her acceptance
of it. She wished that they had been included; she had not thought it right,
or kind to Jemima, to tell them why she was going, and she feared now lest
they should feel a little hurt that they were not asked too. But she need
not have been afraid. They were glad and proud of the attention to her,
and never thought of themselves.</DD>

<DD>
"Ruthie, what gown shall you wear to-night? Your dark-grey one, I suppose?"
asked Miss Benson.</DD>

<DD>
"Yes, I suppose so. I never thought of it; but that is my best."</DD>

<DD>
"Well; then, I shall quill up a ruff for you. You know I am a famous quiller
of net."</DD>

<DD>
Ruth came downstairs with a little flush on her cheeks when she was ready
to go. She held her bonnet and shawl in her hand, for she knew Miss Benson
and Sally would want to see her dressed.</DD>

<DD>
"Is not mamma pretty?" asked Leonard, with a child's pride.</DD>

<DD>
"She looks very nice and tidy," said Miss Benson, who had an idea that
children should not talk or think about beauty.</DD>

<DD>
"I think my ruff looks so nice," said Ruth, with gentle pleasure. And,
indeed, it did look nice, and set off the pretty round throat most becomingly.
Her hair, now grown long and thick, was smoothed as close to her head as
its waving nature would allow, and plaited up in a great rich knot low
down behind. The grey gown was as plain as plain could be.</DD>

<DD>
"You should have light gloves, Ruth," said Miss Benson. She went upstairs,
and brought down a delicate pair of Limerick ones, which had been long
treasured up in a walnut-shell.</DD>

<DD>
"They say them gloves is made of chickens'-skins," said Sally, examining
them curiously. "I wonder how they set about skinning 'em."</DD>

<DD>
"Here, Ruth," said Mr. Benson, coming in from the garden, "here's a rose
or two for you. I am sorry there are no more; I hoped I should have had
my yellow rose out by this time, but the damask and the white are in a
warmer corner, and have got the start."</DD>

<DD>
Miss Benson and Leonard stood at the door, and watched her down the little
passage-street till she was out of sight.</DD>

<DD>
She had hardly touched the bell at Mr. Bradshaw's door, when Mary and Elizabeth
opened it with boisterous glee.</DD>

<DD>
"We saw you coming--we've been watching for you--we want you to come round
the garden before tea; papa is not come in yet. Do come!"</DD>

<DD>
She went round the garden with a little girl clinging to each arm. It was
full of sunshine and flowers, and this made the contrast between it and
the usual large family room (which fronted the north-east, and therefore
had no evening sun to light up its cold, drab furniture) more striking
than usual. It looked very gloomy. There was the great dining-table, heavy
and square; the range of chairs, straight and square; the work-boxes, useful
and square; the colouring of walls, and carpets, and curtains, all of the
coldest description; everything was handsome, and everything was ugly.
Mrs. Bradshaw was asleep in her easy-chair when they came in. Jemima had
just put down her work, and, lost in thought, she leaned her cheek on her
hand. When she saw Ruth she brightened a little, and went to her and kissed
her. Mrs. Bradshaw jumped up at the sound of their entrance, and was wide
awake in a moment.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh! I thought your father was here," said she, evidently relieved to find
that he had not come in and caught her sleeping.</DD>

<DD>
"Thank you, Mrs. Denbigh, for coming to us to-night," said she, in the
quiet tone in which she generally spoke in her husband's absence. When
he was there, a sort of constant terror of displeasing him made her voice
sharp and nervous; the children knew that many a thing passed over by their
mother when their father was away was sure to be noticed by her when he
was present, and noticed, too, in a cross and querulous manner, for she
was so much afraid of the blame which on any occasion of their misbehaviour
fell upon her. And yet she looked up to her husband with a reverence and
regard, and a faithfulness of love, which his decision of character was
likely to produce on a weak and anxious mind. He was a rest and a support
to her, on whom she cast all her responsibilities; she was an obedient,
unremonstrating wife to him; no stronger affection had ever brought her
duty into conflict with any desire of her heart. She loved her children
dearly, though they all perplexed her very frequently. Her son was her
especial darling, because he very seldom brought her into any scrapes with
his father; he was so cautious and prudent, and had the art of "keeping
a calm sough" about any difficulty he might be in. With all her dutiful
sense of the obligation, which her husband enforced upon her, to notice
and tell him everything that was going wrong in the household, and especially
among his children, Mrs. Bradshaw, somehow, contrived to be honestly blind
to a good deal that was not praiseworthy in Master Richard.</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Bradshaw came in before long, bringing with him Mr. Farquhar. Jemima
had been talking to Ruth with some interest before then; but, on seeing
Mr. Farquhar, she bent her head down over her work, went a little paler;
and turned obstinately silent. Mr. Bradshaw longed to command her to speak;
but even he had a suspicion that what she might say, when so commanded,
might be rather worse in its effect than her gloomy silence; so he held
his peace, and a discontented, angry kind of peace it was. Mrs. Bradshaw
saw that something was wrong, but could not tell what; only she became
every moment more trembling, and nervous, and irritable, and sent Mary
and Elizabeth off on all sorts of contradictory errands to the servants,
and made the tea twice as strong, and sweetened it twice as much as--usual,
in hopes of pacifying her husband with good things.</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Farquhar had gone for the last time, or so he thought. He had resolved
(for the fifth time) that he would go and watch Jemima once more, and if
her temper got the better of her, and she showed the old sullenness again,
and gave the old proofs of indifference to his good opinion, he would give
her up altogether, and seek a wife elsewhere. He sat watching her with
folded arms, and in silence. Altogether they were a pleasant family party!</DD>

<DD>
Jemima wanted to wind a skein of wool. Mr. Farquhar saw it, and came to
her, anxious to do her this little service. She turned away pettishly,
and asked Ruth to hold it for her.</DD>

<DD>
Ruth was hurt for Mr. Farquhar, and looked sorrowfully at Jemima; but Jemima
would not see her glance of upbraiding, as Ruth, hoping that she would
relent, delayed a little to comply with her request. Mr. Farquhar did;
and went back to his seat to watch them both. He saw Jemima turbulent and
stormy in look; he saw Ruth, to all appearance heavenly calm as the angels,
or with only that little tinge of sorrow which her friend's behaviour had
called forth. He saw the unusual beauty of her face and form, which he
had never noticed before; and he saw Jemima, with all the brilliancy she
once possessed in eyes and complexion, dimmed and faded. He watched Ruth,
speaking low and soft to the little girls, who seemed to come to her in
every difficulty, and he remarked her gentle firmness when their bed-time
came, and they pleaded to stay up longer (their father was absent in his
counting-house, or they would not have dared to do so). He liked Ruth's
soft, distinct, unwavering "No! you must go. You must keep to what is right,"
far better than the good-natured yielding to entreaty he had formerly admired
in Jemima. He was wandering off into this comparison, while Ruth with delicate
and unconscious tact, was trying to lead Jemima into some subject which
should take her away from the thoughts, whatever they were, that made her
so ungracious and rude.</DD>

<DD>
Jemima was ashamed of herself before Ruth, in a way which she had never
been before any one else. She valued Ruth's good opinion so highly, that
she dreaded lest her friend should perceive her faults. She put a check
upon herself--a check at first; but after a little time she had forgotten
something of her trouble, and listened to Ruth, and questioned her about
Leonard, and smiled at his little witticisms; and only the sighs, that
would come up from the very force of habit, brought back the consciousness
of her unhappiness. Before the end of the evening, Jemima had allowed herself
to speak to Mr. Farquhar in the old way--questioning, differing, disputing.
She was recalled to the remembrance of that miserable conversation by the
entrance of her father. After that she was silent. But he had seen her
face more animated, and bright with a smile, as she spoke to Mr. Farquhar;
and although he regretted the loss of her complexion (for she was still
very pale), he was highly pleased with the success of his project. He never
doubted but that Ruth had given her some sort of private exhortation to
behave better. He could not have understood the pretty art with which,
by simply banishing unpleasant subjects, and throwing a wholesome natural
sunlit tone over others, Ruth had insensibly drawn Jemima out of her gloom.
He resolved to buy Mrs. Denbigh a handsome silk gown the very next day.
He did not believe she had a silk gown, poor creature! He had noticed that
dark-grey stuff, this long, long time, as her Sunday dress. He liked the
colour; the silk one should be just the same tinge. Then he thought that
it would, perhaps, be better to choose a lighter shade, one which might
be noticed as different to the old gown. For he had no doubt she would
like to have it remarked, and, perhaps, would not object to tell people,
that it was a present from Mr. Bradshaw--a token of his approbation. He
smiled a little to himself as he thought of this additional source of pleasure
to Ruth. She, in the meantime, was getting up to go home. While Jemima
was lighting the bed-candle at the lamp, Ruth came round to bid good-night.
Mr. Bradshaw could not allow her to remain till the morrow uncertain whether
he was satisfied or not.</DD>

<DD>
"Good-night, Mrs Denbigh," said he. "Good-night. Thank you. I am obliged
to you--I am exceedingly obliged to you."</DD>

<DD>
He laid emphasis on these words, for he was pleased to see Mr. Farquhar
step forward to help Jemima in her little office.</DD>

<DD>
Mr. Farquhar offered to accompany Ruth home; but the streets that intervened
between Mr. Bradshaw's and the Chapel-house were so quiet that he desisted,
when he learnt. from Ruth's manner how much she disliked his proposal.
Mr. Bradshaw, too, instantly observed--</DD>

<DD>
"Oh! Mrs. Denbigh need not trouble you, Farquhar. I have servants at liberty
at any moment to attend on her, if she wishes it."</DD>

<DD>
In fact, he wanted to make hay while the sun shone, and to detain Mr. Farquhar
a little longer, now that Jemima was so gracious. She went upstairs with
Ruth to help her to put on her things.</DD>

<DD>
"Dear Jemima!" said Ruth, "I am so glad to see you looking better to-night!
You quite frightened me this morning, you looked so ill."</DD>

<DD>
"Did I?" replied Jemima. "O Ruth! I have been so unhappy lately. I want
you to come and put me to rights," she continued, half smiling. "You know
I'm a sort of out-pupil of yours, though we are so nearly of an age. You
ought to lecture me, and make me good."</DD>

<DD>
"Should I, dear?" said Ruth. "I don't think I'm the one to do it."</DD>

<DD>
"Oh yes! you are--you've done me good to-night."</DD>

<DD>
"Well, if I can do anything for you, tell me what it is?" asked Ruth tenderly.</DD>

<DD>
"Oh, not now--not now," replied Jemima. "I could not tell you here. It's
a long story, and I don't know that I can tell you at all. Mamma might
come up at any moment, and papa would be sure to ask what we had been talking
about so long."</DD>

<DD>
"Take your own time, love," said Ruth; "only remember, as far as I can,
how glad I am to help you."</DD>

<DD>
"You're too good, my darling!" said Jemima fondly.</DD>

<DD>
"Don't say so," replied Ruth earnestly, almost as if she were afraid. "God
knows I am not."</DD>

<DD>
"Well! we're none of us too good," answered Jemima; "I know that. But you
<I>are</I> very good. Nay, I won't call you so, if it makes you look so
miserable. But come away downstairs."</DD>

<DD>
With the fragrance of Ruth's sweetness lingering about her, Jemima was
her best self during the next half-hour. Mr. Bradshaw was more and more
pleased, and raised the price of the silk, which he was going to give Ruth,
sixpence a yard during the time. Mr. Farquhar went home through the garden-way,
happier than he had been this long time. He even caught himself humming
the old refrain:</DD>

<DD>
"On revient, on revient toujours,</DD>

<DD>
A ses premiers amours."</DD>

<DD>
But as soon as he was aware of what he was doing, he cleared away the remnants
of the song into a cough, which was sonorous, if not perfectly real.</DD>
